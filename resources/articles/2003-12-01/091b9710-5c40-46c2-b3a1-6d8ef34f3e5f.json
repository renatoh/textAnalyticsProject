On the face of it, this statistic - courtesy of a new survey from the Co-operative Bank - looks like a triumph for quiet activism. Sadly, it is not the full story; \u00a32.6bn might sound like a lot, but it is not a number that in itself will frighten big business. Retail sales - defined by the Office for National Statistics as stuff you take away in shopping bags - were \u00a3230bn last year. Household expenditure, which includes services such as petrol and insurance, amounted to \u00a3667bn. Suddenly, that \u00a32.6bn works out at a mere 4p for every \u00a310 spent by British households. But, before dismissing the power of consumer activism, some qualifications are needed. First, the Co-op Bank took an admirably conservative approach to collecting statistics. It took a panel of 400 shoppers and asked them questions on their spending over eight weeks. Where people claimed to be boycotting products, they had to produce receipts to prove they were buying other brands. It appeared that not everybody understood the questions, like the 9% who claimed to use green energy against the 1% who demonstrably did; in those cases, the answers were disregarded, implying the \u00a32.6bn figure is probably slightly understated. Unfortunately, the Co-op didn't offer a breakdown by brand, only category. Biggest was groceries (\u00a3787m); transport, which was mainly petrol (\u00a3454m); clothing, including sportswear produced in sweatshops (\u00a3232m); and goods where labelling was not explicit, in areas such as GM foods (\u00a3167m). But the wider point is that the success of consumer activism can never be measured solely by statistics. After all, the aim is not to put companies out of business but to change their behaviour. The ones that succeed tend to have an X factor. Barclays pulled out of apartheid South Africa in 1986 after a boycott had roughly halved the bank's share of student accounts from its previous 28%. The X factor in last year's Burma Campaign boycott of Triumph, the lingerie manufacturer, was the advertising. It showed a model wearing a barbed-wire bra under the slogan \"Support breasts not dictators\". Customer complaints and reports of middle-class women returning their bras to Selfridges proved too much for Triumph - it was out of Burma within two months. But even Mark Farmaner, the media and campaigns coordinator, says boycotts are not always the most effective strategy. \"We look at how a company is vulnerable,\" he says. \"Sometimes boycotts are the way to do it, other times it is via shareholders, or protests outside the head office or the store to get media attention. Or it can be behind-the-scenes lobbying with the threat of a boycott in the background.\" Thus, a consumer boycott of BAT, the tobacco group, was a non-starter - smokers don't switch brands easily. BAT eventually withdrew from Burma last month under pressure from the British government. In the cases of WPP, the advertising group, and PricewaterhouseCooper, the accountants - both of whom have corporate rather than consumer clients - the strategy was to place the firms on a Burma \"dirty list\"; both withdrew quickly. But many campaigns have gone unnoticed. The list of boycotts on the website of Ethical Consumer magazine runs from Adidas (for using kangaroo skin in some of its football boots) through to Janet Jackson (for her duet with Beenie Man, whose lyrics have allegedly advocated killing gay people). Then there is the problem of boycotts of companies whose product portfolios are large and diverse - like Nestl\u00e9. The Baby Milk Action boycott on Nestl\u00e9 goods has been in force since 1980, albeit with a suspension from 1984 to 1989. A boycott still in force almost a quarter of century after it was launched does not sound as if it is working, but Patti Rundall, the group's policy director, says it has been invaluable in lobbying for legislation in 70 countries on the marketing of baby milk substitutes. \"It is the boycott that has alerted policy makers to the fact that this is a risky company,\" she says. \"If the boycott wasn't there we wouldn't have had those 70 laws.\" No boycott succeeds quite like the short, sharp shock variety. The classic example is Shell, after it announced plans in 1995 to dump the Brent Spar oil platform into the Atlantic. Shell's pump sales are thought to have halved in some countries after Greenpeace's call for a boycott, though the arson attacks on Shell petrol stations in Germany (which were not part of Greenpeace's strategy) were perhaps just as persuasive. Either way, the protests over Brent Spar and the company's treatment of the Ogoni people of Nigeria prompted Shell to rethink its environmental approach; like BP, it is now regarded as \"progessive\". ExxonMobil, accused by Greenpeace of holding hardline views on climate change, is now the target of the most visible boycott against an oil company. The company says it has seen no impact on its annual UK petrol and diesel sales of \u00a38.8bn, even though Esso is thought to account for the bulk of the Co-op's \u00a3454m figure for transport boycotts. Research on behalf of Stop Esso, by the polling organisation Mori, tends to support the Co-op's finding: it showed that 5% of British motorists say they have stopped buying from Esso. So far, though, the company's only response has been a PR counter-offensive against what it calls the \"highly misleading\" arguments of Stop Esso. That campaign, like Nestl\u00e9's, has the potential to become extremely bitter. \u00b7 Nils Pratley is the Guardian's associate city editor nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
