The foreign secretary followed cabinet ministers, backbenchers and a major party donor in demanding that the frontrunner to succeed Theresa May speak out about the loud, late-night altercation with his partner, Carrie Symonds, which was heard by several neighbours. Hunt intervened as Johnson came under pressure on several fronts: \u2022 Two other cabinet ministers demanded that Johnson explain what happened on Friday. \u2022 A senior member of the 1922 Committee called for \u201copenness\u201d from anyone standing to be prime minister. \u2022 A party donor expressed concerns about the argument, saying it would damage their long-term prospects. Hunt\u2019s comment over Johnson\u2019s refusal to engage with the media will be seen as a coded reference to his opponent\u2019s appearance at Saturday\u2019s leadership race hustings, in which he stonewalled persistent questions about the incident, which took place early on Friday. The former mayor of London is due to take part in a digital hustings with Tory party members on Monday and has refused to say if he will face Hunt in a televised Sky News debate on Tuesday. Hunt suggested Johnson shied away from scrutiny, telling Sky News: \u201cThis is an audition to be prime minister of the UK \u2026 If Boris is refusing to answer questions in the media, refusing to do live debates then of course people are thinking: just who are we going to get as PM?\u201d Hunt also accused Johnson of appearing willing to \u201cslink through the back door\u201d of No 10 by \u201cpathetically\u201d evading questioning. \u201cDon\u2019t be a coward Boris, man up,\u201d he wrote in Monday\u2019s edition of the Times. The story emerged after a neighbour told the Guardian he had been so concerned by a loud, late-night altercation between Johnson and Symonds that he had felt obliged to call the police. Other neighbours confirmed the argument took place and said they had been concerned by its intensity. On Sunday morning, Liam Fox said it was time for Johnson to openly explain the incident so the contest could move away from \u201cthese distractions\u201d and return to the two candidates\u2019 plans as prime minister. Fox, a supporter of Hunt, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cIt\u2019s always easier to give an explanation, then we can discuss the policies.\u201d A second senior minister said: \u201cHe must answer questions, for the same reason that Michael Gove had to explain why he had taken hard drugs.\u201d Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the vice chair of the influential 1922 Committee which coordinates Tory backbench MPs, called on Johnson to set the record straight. \u201cIn politics, I think that openness really does matter. I think that if you are standing for the role of prime minister, the nation has a reasonable expectation that this kind of issue [around personal behaviour] must be cleared up,\u201d he said. One Tory donor, who has given more than \u00a3500,000, told the Guardian that the issue was damaging the party. \u201cWe are a laughing stock,\u201d he said. Gove, the environment secretary and a rival of Johnson, declined to make any comment on the issue, but did not rule out doing so in the future. \u201cI think it is best if I say nothing at this stage,\u201d he said. Police confirmed they were called to the couple\u2019s south London flat after an argument was heard by neighbours, who reported slamming and banging, and added that at one point Symonds could be heard telling Johnson to \u201cget off me\u201d and \u201cget out of my flat\u201d. A poll conducted at the weekend showed support for Johnson had fallen sharply following the incident. His eight-point lead earlier in the week had fallen to three points behind Hunt. Among Tory voters, when asked who would make the best prime minister, Johnson\u2019s lead had slumped from 27% to 11% in the same period, according to Survation, which carried out the polls for the Mail on Sunday. The neighbour who contacted the police, Tom Penn, issued a statement saying that he wanted to put the record straight on his reasons for recording the argument and calling 999. Penn, a playwright, said he acted only as a last resort and that he was speaking out because he was concerned by the \u201cbizarre and fictitious allegations\u201d made about him and his wife. Several Tory MPs have criticised the actions of Penn and claimed that his complaint was politically motivated because his partner has expressed hostility on social media towards Johnson. According to the Mail, Symonds described the recordings as a \u201cpolitical stitch up\u201d. But Penn has said they were motivated only by concern for the welfare of those in the flat. Dame Vera Baird, who will become the next victims\u2019 commissioner of England and Wales on Monday, told the Guardian that neighbours were right to contact the police with their concerns. \u201cI am in no doubt at all that given what they [the neighbours] said they heard, they should have done what they did \u2013 knock on the door, and try and offer any personal help, and then, when they got no reply, call the police. That is what the women\u2019s sector want potential witnesses to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI think its absolutely in the public interest that people do.\u201d In a further development, fellow Vote Leave campaigner and defence secretary Penny Mordaunt has urged Tory activists to \u201cturn away from Boris\u201d \u2013 a candidate who \u201ccreates drama\u201d. \u201cThe case before the members of the Conservative party is straightforward. A character? Or someone with character?\u201d she wrote in the Daily Express. Johnson has so far declined to comment on the incident. In his Monday column for the Telegraph he focussed on delivering Brexit by Halloween. The Daily Mail claimed that, according to friends of the former foreign secretary, the couple have spent the weekend away from their flat to avoid protesters and their \u201cloving and doting\u201d relationship is \u201cstronger than ever\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
