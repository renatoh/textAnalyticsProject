The meeting, in Rome, has given the Scots a start of two home games and a meeting with Moldova before taking on group favourites Italy in March 2005. Berti Vogts' side kick off against Slovenia and face Norway, their main rivals for a play-off spot, a month later. They will then have four days before a potentially tricky trip to Moldova. The game in Italy in March is the first fixture after a break for winter, followed by a June double header that sees the Moldovans come to Glasgow before Vogts' players make the long and potentially hazardous journey to Belarus a few days later. The whole campaign reaches critical point in September when the Italians come to Glasgow, with the Tartan Army decamping to Norway the following Wednesday. The destiny of the group will be decided the following month when Belarus come to Scotland and Vogts will be desperate to ensure that the final game in Slovenia will still be a meaningful one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
