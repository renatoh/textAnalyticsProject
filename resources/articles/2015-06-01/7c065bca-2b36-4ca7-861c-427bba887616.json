Holiday firms scrambled to provide extra flights on top of scheduled services for people seeking to return home. Flights to the country were cancelled. Matthew James, from Trehafod, Pontypridd, south Wales, who was hit in the hip, chest and pelvis as he shielded his fiancee, Saera Wilson, 26, from gunfire at the resort, was among those back in Britain. The 30-year-old\u2019s mother, Kathryn Matthews, wrote of her feelings on seeing her son and Saera leave the plane. She told friends on Facebook that her son \u2013 known to pals as \u201cSas\u201d \u2013 had held the hand of a dying man who had also been shot. \u201cSas and Saera are back on home turf and safe. He\u2019s in good spirits and is getting the very best of care. It was the most fantastic feeling seeing Saera step off the plane and Sas stretchered off \u2026 [they are] back where they belong. \u201cSo proud of him, after being the first to be shot and making sure Saera got to safety he held the hand of an elderly gent who lay dying next to him, totally overwhelmed by it all.\u201d Matthews said her son was looking forward to being reunited with his children. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) estimated that about 20,000 Britons were currently on holidays in Tunisia arranged through Abta members, but said there would also be some holidaymakers who had travelled independently. The holiday firm Tui, owner of Thomson and First Choice, said it was flying people to the UK on Sunday on 12 planes leaving Enfidha airport, about 25 miles from Sousse. It asked for customers to show patience. \u201cWe\u2019d like to reassure all other customers that our team is working round the clock, handling a \u2026 moving and challenging situation to make the necessary arrangements for our customers in Tunisia \u2026 we ask that they please bear with us,\u201d Thomson and First Choice said in a statement. \u201cThose affected by the tragic events in Tunisia are our main priority and we will continue to do all we can to support our customers as well as their family and friends in the resort at this exceptionally difficult time.\u201d Tui said that about 250 of its German customers had chosen to return early from their holiday in Tunisia after the attack, but most people visiting the country, about 3,500, were staying on. Tui said that by Sunday it had had about 500 calls from people taking up the offer to fly out, and that the Canary Islands, Turkey and Egypt topped the list of customers\u2019 alternative destinations. Thomas Cook said 1,100 people who had cut short their stay in Tunisia were among 3,600 who had flown back since the attack. It laid on two extra flights on Saturday and another on Sunday. Thomson and First Choice had 12 additional flights leaving Enfidha airport on Sunday for airports including Doncaster, Cardiff, Gatwick, Stansted, Bristol, Luton, Newcastle, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, and East Midlands. Jet2Holidays said it had flown home more than 600 tourists at the weekend, with a further flight due to leave on Sunday night. The Foreign Office updated its advice for travelling to Tunisia. On its website it said people should not go to the Chaambi Mountain national park area, the Tunisia-Algeria border crossings at Ghardimaou, Hazoua and Sakiet Sidi Youssef, the militarised area south of El Borma and Dhehiba, or within three miles of the Libyan border."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
