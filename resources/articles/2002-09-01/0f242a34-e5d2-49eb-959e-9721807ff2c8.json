Harris, who left Leeds Rhinos to play union for Cardiff and Wales 12 months ago in a deal worth more than \u00a3500,000, has been struggling for club and country after a promising start. He lost his place in the Wales team during last season's Six Nations Championship and has been out of favour with Cardiff this season; he made only the substitutes' bench for their Celtic League match last weekend. That has alerted Neil Kelly, the coach of the Wales league team, who plans to sound out Harris next Tuesday at a press conference in Cardiff to promote the international match - as well as the Challenge Cup final, which will also be played at the Millennium Stadium on April 26. \"If somebody said to me that Iestyn Harris is available, I would snap his hand off,\" said Kelly, who also coaches Widnes in the Super League. \"I think everybody in rugby league feels a bit of sympathy for Iestyn Harris because it hasn't turned out to be the dream change he wanted. \"It could be beneficial both for Iestyn and Cardiff, as well as us, if he does come back to play against the Kiwis. I haven't spoken to him recently but I wouldn't have thought he is too pleased with how things are working out for him at the moment. \"This could be a confidence booster for him, and I can see a situation where Cardiff would be happy with that.\" Harris's presence would also be certain to increase attendance for the fixture, with the Rugby Football League hoping to match the record 18,000 it attracted to the Millennium Stadium for a match between Wales and New Zealand in the 2000 World Cup. However, there is no suggestion that Harris, who has been capped seven times by Wales since switching to union, will make a permanent return to rugby league - at least not yet. Gary Hetherington, chief executive of Leeds, who retained the stand-off's league registration when he moved to Wales, said yesterday there was \"nothing afoot other than what has already been arranged\". Harris is due to return to Leeds, and rugby league, the summer after next, after he has completed his union commitments for the 2003-04 season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
