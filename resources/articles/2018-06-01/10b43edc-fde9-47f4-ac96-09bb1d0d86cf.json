Consumer group Which? said the enforcement regime was buckling under \u201chuge strain\u201d, with under-resourced local authorities struggling to cope with soaring complaints from the public \u2013 about dirty conditions and food poisoning, for example \u2013 and facing an increase in their workload because of Brexit. Using official data collected by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), Which? analysed and ranked 390 local authorities across the UK. The benchmarks it used were the percentage of food businesses deemed to be at \u201chigh and medium risk\u201d that were compliant with food hygiene standards; the percentage of premises opened but not visited or rated for risk; and interventions needed that had actually been carried out. Birmingham had a poor record for carrying out inspections within 28 days of a food business opening, with 16% of the city\u2019s more than 8,000 food businesses still to be rated. In addition, 43% of Birmingham\u2019s high and medium-risk food businesses did not meet compliance standards. The Lancashire borough of Hyndburn, where Accrington is the largest town, was the second worst area in the UK for food hygiene in 2016\u201317. While 98% of its businesses had been rated for risk, just two in five of its medium and high-risk food businesses met food hygiene standards, compared with 98% in Harrogate, which is about an hour away in North Yorkshire. For a second year top of the table for food hygiene was the Erewash borough council in East Derbyshire. It carried out planned interventions on all failing premises, and an 97% of its medium and high-risk establishments proved compliant with hygiene standards. \u201cWhen it comes to food, British consumers expect the very best standards for themselves and their families\u201d said Alex Neill, managing director of home products and services at Which? \u201cBut our enforcement regime is under huge strain, just as Brexit threatens to add to the responsibilities of struggling local authorities. \u201cEffective food enforcement must be a government priority, including robust checks on imports as well as cooperation with the EU and other countries on food risks.\u201d The Birmingham city council said it inspected the second highest number of premises and closed more than any other English local authority. Mark Croxford, the head of environmental health, said: \u201cThe quality of food businesses in Birmingham is not a measure or reflection of the council\u2019s performance. I am surprised and disappointed to see Which? have made the same mistake as they have done in previous years, in failing to engage with local authorities to produce a meaningful report.\u201d Hyndburn claimed that 92.5% of its food businesses were now fully complaint and it had taken \u201csignificant strides to improve food hygiene\u201d. Responsibility for enforcing food safety falls to environmental health teams within local authorities, overseen by the FSA and Food Standards Scotland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
