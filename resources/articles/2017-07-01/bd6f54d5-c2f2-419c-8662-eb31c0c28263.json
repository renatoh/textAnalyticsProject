The Liverpool forward Shanice van de Sanden scored the only goal of the game after 66 minutes following an excellent cross from Lieke Martens, one of the match\u2019s dominant players. Sarina Wiegman\u2019s team fully deserved the three points after a performance full of attacking verve in front of 21,732 fans at the Stadion Galgenwaard in Utrecht. The Chelsea midfielder Maren Mjelde came close with a free-kick for Norway, their best effort of the game. The striker Ada Hegerberg was largely kept quiet by the Dutch defence. Her best chance came with a minute remaining, but the Arsenal goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal had no problems with her deflected strike. Early goal gives Denmark win over Belgium Sanne Troelsgaard headed home what proved to be the only goal in Doetinchem in the sixth minute to give Denmark the points from their opening game with Belgium. Troelsgaard reacted the quickest after Pernille Harder\u2019s free-kick was tipped on to the crossbar. The closest Belgium came to finding the net was through Janice Cayman\u2019s flicked effort, which was well saved by the Denmark goalkeeper, Stina Lykke Petersen. In the next round of games in Group A Norway play Belgium on Thursday (5pm BST), while Holland meet Denmark later on the same day (7.45pm BST)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
