Take the fall in turnout, at 65%. Or the sharp decline in people registered to vote. Today's Electoral Commission study shows it is down from more than 90% 10 years ago to just 82% this year. There are many reasons: people think it's not worth it, or they imagine that if they pay council tax they must be registered too, or they simply want to be private. In the heyday of democratic pomp, access to the register was regulated. But in the political culture of the 1990s, where everything had to be monetised, councils were allowed to cover the costs of creating their register by selling it, usually to credit agencies, which in turn could sell it on. After that was ruled illegal in 2001, the government introduced an edited register from which voters can exclude themselves, if they remember. Later, the government promised to abolish it altogether. But it lingers on, a travesty of the democratic process that sullies the relationship between voter and state, and illustrates just how casually politicians think about democracy. Now is the moment for change. At the next election voters will have to register individually instead of by household. It is an overdue transition, but it comes just as the democratic culture is weakening. Low registration will have an impact on the next generation of boundary reviews and has worrying implications for party representation. The government should treat voters with enough respect to keep their personal information private."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
