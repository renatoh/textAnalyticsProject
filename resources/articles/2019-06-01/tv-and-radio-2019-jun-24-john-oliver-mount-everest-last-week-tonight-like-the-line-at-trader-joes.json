First summited in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the mountain has recently become a tourist destination, resulting in a greater number of fatalities. \u201cClimbing Mount Everest has somehow gone from being a rare feat of extraordinary skill to something that looks like the line at Trader Joe\u2019s.\u201d The influx of climbers has left the mountain polluted with litter, with a clean-up expedition collecting 24,000lb of garbage. \u201cThere\u2019s also a lot of human shit up the mountain which, thanks in part to climate change, is now sliding downhill in what\u2019s been called a fecal time bomb. Which, by the way, is a phrase that really should be printed on every baby onesie because it\u2019s cute and it\u2019s accurate.\u201d Oliver explained there is an optimal season for climbing Everest, which this year shrank due to bad weather. Since the 1990s a boom in commercial expeditions had led to crowding on the mountain. Luxury expeditions can cost up to $130,000, with some including heated tents and dining tables. Sherpas are crucial to getting up the mountain. \u201cFor many climbers, Everest is not unlike Simon and Garfunkel. There is someone along for the ride to the top and there\u2019s someone pulling all the weight. \u201cSherpas with an uppercase S are an ethnic group, sherpas lowercase S are the mountain workers, some of whom, but not all, are Sherpas uppercase S. Extra fun fact: a word that changes meaning when it\u2019s capitalized is known as a capitonym. Now you have the perfect tidbit handy next time you want to completely self-destruct on the first date,\u201d explained Oliver. One of the hardest jobs is securing the area for climbers with ladders and ropes to make the ascent easier. The Khumbu icefall is particularly fatal to sherpas and others, with huge blocks of ice prone to falling and huge crevasses. Paying clients only have to go through a few times, but the sherpas must cross it almost 40 times a night to carry the climbers\u2019 luggage. In fact, being a sherpa is among the most dangerous jobs in the world. \u201cAnd the fact that they are risking their lives for the ambitions of well-off climbers is uncomfortable to square,\u201d Oliver said. One TV presenter asked a sherpa about the task and the sherpa replied it was like family, leading the presenter to hug the sherpa. The presenter later said it erased the line between client and sherpa. \u201cBut it is client and sherpa,\u201d pointed out Oliver. \u201cThat is not the warm embrace of family. That\u2019s one man physically squeezing the white guilt out of another.\u201d According to mountaineers, Everest isn\u2019t a big technical challenge. Those climbing just have to be fit enough. Even so, inexperience can kill, particularly in the Death Zone above 26,000 feet, which has only 30% of the oxygen at sea level. In this area, the body is put under intense pressure, the stomach stops digesting food, blood stops reaching toes and fingers, and the brain is being squeezed out of the head into the spinal cord. \u201cWell, that\u2019s delightful,\u201d said the host. Everest offers two routes to the summit: one from the Tibetan side and the other from Nepal. The Tibet side is more difficult and the Chinese government has strict limits on who and how many people can go. The Nepalese side is easier, attracting two-thirds of climbers, with no limits on their quality or quantity. For a Nepalese permit, the only requirements are a fee of $11,000 and a doctor\u2019s note deeming the climber physically fit. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big loophole there, because even the least physically fit person on earth can get a glowing doctor\u2019s note and I know this for a fact because he recently did,\u201d said Oliver as a photo of Trump was displayed. \u201cIf Cirque du Soleil had half its trapeze artists be trained acrobats and the other half enthusiasts with $11,000 and their own tiger bodysuit, you would shut that shit down before someone got badly hurt.\u201d Bad climbing companies rarely turn down inexperienced climbers. The Canadian Shriya Shah-Klorfine had no experience but was told she could succeed if she was determined enough. She died coming down the mountain, after reaching the summit. Inexperienced climbers can be a danger to themselves and others. Oliver showed a clip of climbers complaining about the inexperienced climbers in front who were holding up the line. \u201cThink about the violent rage that you felt the last time you couldn\u2019t walk down an escalator because a bunch of assholes were standing still. Now, imagine doing that for hours in freezing temperatures as your brain leaks slowly down your spinal cord.\u201d Even Sir Edmund Hillary has expressed disappointment over the commercialization of the climb. He believes people just want to boast. \u201cIf it is just a summit photo that you want, faking it is probably the most ethically defensible way to get it,\u201d said Oliver. The show even created a Photoshop site, thetopofmounteverest.com, for those who would like to do just that. \u201cClimbing Mount Everest has become an industry with blood on its hands, but no one can deny it\u2019s become one of the most striking photos you have of yourself,\u201d said Oliver."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
