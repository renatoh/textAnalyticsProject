'Mercury' has a sweaty dancehall beat with Kele's one-line vocal copied and pasted across a discordant tangle of squelchy horns. It's a snarling dance record that frees Bloc Party from the chains of indie pigeonholing and hurls them on course to be the British N.E.R.D."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
