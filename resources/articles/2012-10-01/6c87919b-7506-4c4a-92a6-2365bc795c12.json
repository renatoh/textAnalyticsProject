Indhu Rubasingham takes over with panache at the Tricycle, bowing to the theatre's politically engaged tradition but giving it a sharp new turn. During Nicolas Kent's 28-year reign the Tricycle's glory was its tremendous tribunal dramas: transparently acted revelatory documentaries. Red Velvet, based on the life of the African American actor Ira Aldridge, also puts prejudice \u2013 racial and sexual \u2013 on trial, but it does so with imaginative flourishes, and extends its inquiry beyond the obviously political. Lolita Chakrabarti's play has a towering central performance from Adrian Lester. Rubasingham's production glows. Aldridge's story is compelling and dismaying. Taking over as Othello when Edmund Kean keeled over on the stage of Covent Garden in 1833, he was subjected to stinking racism by semi-evolved critics \u2013 \"his features, though African, are considerably humanised\" \u2013 and to sidling contempt by those who claimed that casting him as the Moor was like casting a fat man as Falstaff: the transformative powers of acting were being denied. He was withdrawn from the play. He went on to tour the world but never acted again in London. Chakrabarti's fresh and sparky, if sometimes sketchy play, with its spine of historical fact and its imaginary limbs, uses the green room and the stage to light up the globe. As offstage protests about the abolition of slavery mount, one actor eschews sugar on political grounds, while in the background a Jamaican maid sits waiting to be bossed. A very funny scene shows one actor convulsed by the difficulty of announcing to his colleagues that the unseen new lead is \u2013 actually \u2013 black. As Aldridge struggles to bring reality to stage encounters, he is enveloped in an extraordinary tableau of 19th-century gestural theatre: hands shade eyes and cup ears; arms wave in the air like multiple tarantulas. In Tom Piper's design, smoke drifts across a beautiful gilt proscenium arch and looped red velvet curtains; Oliver Fenwick's rosy lighting encloses and intensifies the action. There is a virtuoso performance from Rachel Finnegan, making her professional debut as, alternately, an eager Polish journo, a slightly stiff wife and an awkward ingenue. There is unwavering magnificence from Lester. Eager, strong and reverberating as a young man, he thickens and halts in disappointed maturity. Finally, bent and cross, he prepares to play King Lear \u2013 by whiting up. Next year Lester will take on Othello at the National. That will be unmissable. \"To act it is to kill it,\" Samuel Beckett said of his 1956 radio play All That Fall. He did not want it put on stage, but this is not the first time his wish has been thwarted on a technicality \u2013 and no one who has a ticket for Trevor Nunn's already sold-out production is going to regret the disobedience. This is little-known but prime Beckett. On the plot of a woman (\"church-going, rheumatic and childless\") making a laborious journey to meet her blind husband is hung a disquisition on the melancholy of life \u2013 what is unforgettably called its \"shrouding\" \u2013 and thoughts on the slipperiness of language. This must be the only play that contains both a reference to Grimm's law and the idea that a character might eavesdrop on his own speech. To meet the restrictions imposed by the Beckett estate, the drama is staged as if a radio play were being recorded: microphones hang from the ceiling; the cast read from scripts; there is minimal movement. You would not want more. The language is rich, waxing as it speaks of waning. Beckett's sound effects populate the stage with the rural Ireland of his childhood (several characters have names based on people he knew in his youth): there is crowing, dragging, mooing, sucking, ringing, baaing, parping. In a strong cast Michael Gambon and Eileen Atkins, last seen on stage together in another train-based drama (Yasmina Reza's The Unexpected Man) 14 years ago, are so commanding and intricate that they deliver a wealth of action in a tiny area. Gambon brings a baleful spleneticism, that wounded beast quality in which he specialises, to the part of the husband who may have a terrible secret to unleash. Atkins, the linchpin of the play, shows the mighty miniaturism that has made her one of the most important actors of the past 50 years. She can turn a line by a flick of an eyelid, set up a ripple of irony by a slackening of her jaw; every line is given a doleful clarity. The switch from audio to visual entails some loss. The sound effects become more illustrative than informative. Some radio wryness \u2013 what is it to feature a blind man in a medium that no one sees? \u2013 is diminished. Nunn's showmanship occasionally gets the better of him, not least with a bad cut-out car. Yet anyone interested in acting and speech will want to see this. It must surely find a life beyond the enterprising little Jermyn. It is more intriguing than satisfying to watch Sean Holmes's revival of the seldom-seen Desire Under the Elms. Eugene O'Neill's 1924 play is intermittently powerful but often awkward and overblown, as if a sad solo voice were hollering out the Ring Cycle. In transplanting the Phaedra myth \u2013 man falls for mother-in-law and all hell breaks loose \u2013 it swerves from the hokey to the plangent, from the terrifying to the ridiculous, and ends on a note of true sadness. Holmes's production matches these shifts: sometimes rapt and sometimes ironic it shows both meltdown and hoedown, with bendy hats, big beards, much yelping in unison and tragic disintegration. Ian MacNeil's design features one of those small-scale houses that he has used to startling effect in An Inspector Calls and, more recently, A Doll's House. This one, more wendy house than farmhouse, is less appropriate: the little rooms \u2013 on a different scale to the play's sonorous language \u2013 that slip around the stage to the sound of a slide guitar are far too spick and span. Finbar Lynch brings a fine, weary-voiced gravity to bear on the part of the growling paterfamilias: he looks and sounds like someone who has preaching in his bones, though a large part of his dialogue is taken up with growling. Still, the revelation is Denise Gough. She has been arresting before \u2013 as a prostitute in The Painter, and earlier this year as a gangling, disruptive nanny in Our New Girl. Now she spreads her wings as a fatal attraction: wheedling, sassy, desperate, true. She has a light touch and a big future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
