Nan is grandmother to Billy, the only child of her son, Alec, and his ex-wife, Virginia. Nan\u2019s husband, she discovered late in her marriage, was gay and forthright Nan now occupies her time planning for her funeral (which shows no signs of being imminent) and fulfilling her secret career as a successful poet. Blanche became estranged from her son and his family after she drove her grandchildren home drunk. Unable to acknowledge her responsibility for the family rift, she is bitter and angry and takes to shoplifting meaningless items from local stores. Minna, meanwhile, is a surrogate rather than biological grandmother. A neighbour\u2019s child, Rose, spends much of her free time in the shepherd\u2019s hut where Minna lives alone, following a disastrous affair with a married man decades earlier, which has left her heartbroken. What unites the three characters, who are unknown to each other at the beginning of the novel but become acquainted through a series of improbable encounters, is their belief that their grandchildren are ill-served by their parents and that they, as grandmothers, are far better equipped to understand and provide what their grandchildren need. Minna is critical of Rose\u2019s mother, who \u201csporadically instituted a clearing out of what she considered an overpopulation of toys\u201d, which Minna encourages Rose to bring to her home instead. Nan is resentful and censorious of her son, Alec, whom she feels is neglectful of Billy. Overbearing Blanche rails against \u201cterrible, terrible Tina, for surely it was Tina, her daughter-in-law, who was behind all this\u201d while demonstrating no remorse for her drink-driving. One assumes Vickers wants us to sympathise with her grandmothers, but their behaviour fails to elicit sympathy and she offers insufficient distinction between their predicaments for the reader to engage with. While Minna and Nan have tragic backstories, these neither explain nor excuse their sense of entitlement. In Vickers\u2019s world, grandparents take precedence over parents, and grandmothers fill the void of their own maternal failings with an excessive involvement in their grandchildren\u2019s lives. No parent in the novel is capable of a healthy relationship with their child, making for a rather bleak \u2013 and one-note \u2013 portrayal of extended family life. As with her previous novels, Vickers has a keen ear for dialogue and there are moments of wry humour. But while some important issues are explored here \u2013 loneliness, regret, intergenerational discord \u2013 the novel lacks the emotional breadth and narrative texture of a nuanced, engaging read. \u2022 Grandmothers by Salley Vickers is published by Viking (\u00a316.99).
