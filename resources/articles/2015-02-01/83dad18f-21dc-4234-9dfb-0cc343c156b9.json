At the moment, though, there\u2019s still something a little too templated about them. Their second album \u2013 their first since Fat Possum signed them \u2013 has everything you\u2019d expect from plaid-shirted American rockers: the langorous, smoky voice of Rob Grote, ragged guitars, debts to the usual suspects (the Replacements, especially) and the feeling that, yes, there\u2019s something attractive here. But, on record at least, the spark of individuality is missing. The almost nine-minute Young Blood seems to be that long because the Districts felt a serious band needs an epic, rather than because every moment of it is strictly necessary. Still, there are moments when they twist the familiar in ways to suggest they will find their own voice: a singer complaining about how he doesn\u2019t fit into his oppressive small town is no one\u2019s idea of a fresh subject, but Grote\u2019s observation about the jocks who want to \u201claugh and watch the retard dance\u201d feels spiky, original and chilling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
