Anneliese Dodds, the newly appointed shadow chancellor, was interrupted by her daughter while speaking to Kay Burley on Sky News on Monday morning. Dodds, who was given the shadow cabinet role by the new Labour leader, Keir Starmer, on Sunday, had been discussing the economic impact of the coronavirus lockdown when her three-year-old daughter, Isabella, strolled in. She said: \u201cWe need to get to the best possible situation for dealing with the virus and then ensuring we have that economic support there for businesses and individuals that they need at this time.\u201d As Isabella walked through the door to the room and stood next to her mother, Burley said: \u201cSomebody wants to come and say hello to you while you\u2019re on the telly. We\u2019ve seen this before haven\u2019t we \u2026 she\u2019s welcome any time on the programme.\u201d \u201cI thought she was going to stay asleep, sorry \u2026 so embarrassing,\u201d Dodds said, when asked about the moment at the interview\u2019s close. \u201cShe\u2019s thankfully under the chair now.\u201d The clip is reminiscent of the viral TV moment when Prof Robert Kelly\u2019s two small children interrupted his comments on South Korean politics during a live BBC News interview. The clip has since been watched more than 37m times on the broadcaster\u2019s YouTube channel. Dodds is the MP for Oxford East. She and her partner, Ed Turner, also have a six-year-old, Freddie, according to a Facebook post she created after last December\u2019s general election. While speaking on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain during another remote interview on Monday, Dodds said it was critical that the government began working on a way out of the economic shutdown immediately. \u201cI think it\u2019s critical that the government look at that economic exit strategy now because it will take some time to plan. I really hope also they will be working closely with other countries on this because we will need to have a global boost,\u201d she said. Dodds said she would speak to her counterpart in government, Rishi Sunak, later on Monday as she stressed the importance of working with the Conservatives during the pandemic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
