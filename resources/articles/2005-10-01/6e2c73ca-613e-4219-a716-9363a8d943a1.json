The auction saw Mittal Steel, the world's biggest steel producer which is controlled by Lakshmi Mittal, Britain's richest man, secure control of the Ukrainian steel mill with a killer bid of 24.2bn hryvna - \u00a32.7bn. The early stages of the auction had swiftly seen off the locally-based LLCSmart-Group, after Arcelor and its Ukrainian partner opened the bidding at 12.6bn hryvna when all the bidders put sealed envelopes into a glass bin. The auctioneer, eye-witnesses said, raised his gavel and counted out one, two, before Arcelor and Mittal raised their offers by lifting white placards offering another 100m hryvna. With its winning bid Mittal takes 93% of Kryvorizhstal. The auction was the latest stage in Ukraine's Orange Revolution, the pro-democracy movement headed by Viktor Yushchenko, the politician poisoned and disfigured for life by his opponents. Now president, he is set on leading his country into eventual membership of the EU. The televised auction was an exercise in transparency designed to prove to fractious western companies that Ukraine, despite the recent enforced resignation of its premier, Yulia Tymoshenko, and reform setbacks, is a good place to do business. The sell-off contrasted with the murky privatisations of state-owned enterprises in neighbouring Russia to men who subsequently became billionaire oligarchs. It also overturned last year's sale of the same company for just \u00a3450m to a local firm controlled by Viktor Pinchuk, the son-in-law of Leonid Kuchma, Mr Yushchenko's predecessor and bitter rival in rigged elections. Mr Yushchenko, who repeatedly called last year's sell-off a \"theft,\" had to resort to the courts to nullify the deal. He ignored a parliamentary vote to halt yesterday's resale in his campaign to restore western confidence. Even his own erstwhile supporters were unhappy. Mr Mittal was forced to brush past demonstrators burning orange T-shirts and holding aloft placards saying: \"The people own Kryvorizhstal.\" Valentyna Semenyuk, head of Ukraine's state property fund which conducted the sale, resigned in protest from her hospital bed, where she was admitted over the weekend with high blood pressure. Mr Mittal, no stranger to controversy himself because of his generous donations to the Labour party in Britain and alleged use of political links in a string of east European privatisations, admitted he had been \"nervous\" - but that was at the price he paid. Arcelor certainly thought he had overpaid. The group is paying 60% more than the Yushchenko government's target price. Mr Mittal, who praised the auction as \"the most transparent and professional process in selling state enterprises,\" said Kryvorizhstal could become the group's largest steel plant in the region and offer the company $200m (\u00a3113m) in cost-savings by the end of 2006. The Ukrainian plant adds 10m tons of steel crude capacity and 6.7m tons of shipments to Mittal's empire, which shipped 42.1m tons last year. Mittal, which plans to export some of its crude to other plants, said it sat on 1bn tonnes of iron ore reserves, producing 17.1m tonnes last year. The plant, which accounts for 20% of the country's metal output and, at yesterday's price, is worth a fifth of its national budget, had sales last year of $1.9bn. Mr Yushchenko plans to use the proceeds to fund social programmes and cut the country's debt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
