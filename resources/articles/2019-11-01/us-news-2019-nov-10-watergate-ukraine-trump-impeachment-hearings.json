They were a national TV blockbuster, beamed into millions of homes in the days before media fragmentation, internet echo chambers and alternative facts. This week, House Democrats will hope to recreate that sense of occasion when they begin public impeachment hearings regarding Donald Trump and his attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Televised hearings will \u201cbe an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves\u201d, Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, has said. But it will also be a battle with Republicans in the court of public opinion. At stake is the framing of a narrative crucial to the impact of the hearings for an impeachment vote, the 2020 presidential election and the history books. Schiff will hope to avoid a replay of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s congressional testimony in July, about which the broadcaster Chuck Todd commented: \u201cOn optics, this was a disaster.\u201d Todd was widely criticised but it did become clear that Mueller\u2019s stumbling performance failed to shift public opinion as Democrats had hoped. The Watergate hearings, prompted by a break-in at Democratic party headquarters and a cover-up, gripped the nation as the evidence against Richard Nixon built hour after hour, day after day, over seven months. The impact was \u201ctremendous\u201d, said John Farrell, a biographer of the president who resigned before he could be impeached. \u201cThe main feeling that they conveyed on television was how serious and solemn both Democrats and Republicans were in addressing what they clearly saw was a major constitutional duty,\u201d Farrell said, \u201cand so the whole thing was very stirring and patriotic and the debate was conducted at a very high level. \u201cIt makes me wonder whether or not this week\u2019s hearings are going to be able to stick by that or if they\u2019re going to be one of the more partisan, rancour-filled enterprises that we\u2019ve had on things like Benghazi or even so far on this issue.\u201d Farrell added: \u201cYou hope that people will try to pull themselves away from the snark and the terribly leading questions when the cameras are on but they may choose to grandstand for their base. Republicans, in particular, could decide that they just want to make the whole thing look like a circus, to tarnish it in the public eye. \u201cSo I don\u2019t have a lot of hope but I do have some hope that they try to rise to the level of their predecessors.\u201d The official Senate website recounts how, during the Watergate hearings, TV crews, photographers and print journalists competed with Senate staff and curious onlookers for space in the Senate caucus room. \u201cOnly one month after the hearings began, an overwhelming majority of Americans \u2013 97% \u2013 had heard of Watergate,\u201d the site states. \u201cOf those, 67% believed that President Nixon had participated in the Watergate cover-up.\u201d According to Gallup, 71% of Americans watched the Watergate hearings live. The major networks \u2013 ABC, CBS and NBC \u2013 rotated daily coverage while the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) broadcast all 247 hours, gavel-to-gavel, as they happened and again in prime time. Last week, Bill Moyers, a veteran broadcast journalist, took out a full-page advert in the New York Times, urging PBS to do the same for the Trump hearings. The top US diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, and another senior diplomat, George Kent, will appear on Wednesday. The former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch will testify on Friday. All three have answered questions behind closed doors but will now be asked publicly what they knew about Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. Cable viewers will have options including neutral C-Span, conservative Fox News and liberal MSNBC, all expected to provide wildly different interpretations of the proceedings. These will also be the first impeachment hearings in the era of Facebook, Twitter and other social media. Farrell said: \u201cThe trashing of the witnesses has already begun on Twitter with the hand of the president\u2019s family. It\u2019s one reason to doubt that this week\u2019s hearings are going to be held at the same high level that they were in 1974.\u201d Now 66, Farrell was a student at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville at the time of the Watergate hearings, watching with millions of others through to a satisfactory conclusion. \u201cEverybody rose to the occasion,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe one phrase that was used in September 1974 was: \u2018The system worked.\u2019 \u201cIt was said over and over and over again and almost every part of the system could pat itself on the back: the press and the courts and then finally the House of Representatives and then even the Republican senators going down and telling Nixon it was time to go. \u201cEverybody sort of exhaled and said, \u2018Wow, it worked, Gerry Ford [Nixon\u2019s successor] is a good guy and we dodged a bullet.\u2019\u201d Could the same happen in 2019, with the hearings driving a shift in public opinion that persuades Republican senators to turn against Trump? Don\u2019t hold your breath. \u201cI would hate to predict,\u201d Farrell said, \u201cbut at this point I don\u2019t see the Senate voting to convict the guy. So we\u2019re liable to be left hanging a little bit by all this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
