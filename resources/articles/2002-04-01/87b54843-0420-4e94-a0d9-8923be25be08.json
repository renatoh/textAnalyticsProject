She repeats her mantra so often - even while having an affair - that she drives you mad with her hypocrisy. But Hornby turns the tables when he introduces a character who is genuinely good: her reformed husband, who gives away the kids' toys (\"You've got so much!\") and lives up to all the liberal tenets of the educated middle classes, making Katie's life hell and aggravating us in the most satisfying way. A thought-provoking read - not as lovable as, say, High Fidelity, but more mature and with brilliant set pieces, especially the N1 dinner hosts who can't cope with an uncynical guest. Glue Irvine Welsh (Vintage, \u00a36.99) Welsh's prose style has been parodied so much since Trainspotting that it's hard not to laugh at its undiluted east-coast Scots and profanity at first. And if you haven't read one of his books before, the dialect has the effect of blurring the narrative voices of the four boys who grow up over the course of Glue. Once you're into the rhythm, though, it works, searing the grunge and misery of the Edinburgh \"schemes\" into your mind. It's just a pity there's so much of it: Carl, Billy, Gally and \"Juice\" Terry take 345 pages to get up to the end of the 1990s, and many scenes are unnecessarily drawn-out - the one about the dogs and the bolt-cutters springs to mind. Thinks... David Lodge (Penguin, \u00a36.99) We're on familiar Lodge territory here: a concrete campus is his battlefield and two intellectuals his opponents. Helen is a widowed novelist, Ralph a married professor of cognitive science. Both are involved in the study of consciousness, she through her art and he through his science. Can the twain ever meet? Lodge, meanwhile, is the unseen third party in their relationship: he gives us a back door into each of their private thoughts, playing all the while with theories of mind and painfully constructed academic jokes that span several pages. This all needs a good deal of exposition, which keeps the novel drier than I'd like, but Lodge is always a pleasure to read. Rescue Me Christopher Hart (Faber, \u00a36.99) Hart's previous book was The Harvest , a slow-burning tale of rural adolescent rage. Rescue Me could hardly be more different: it is urban, light, even funny. Daniel, an adman, loses his job and takes up prostitution - er, sorry, escort work. It's a breeze until the day he falls in love. The romance unfolds with some of the usual hitches and some quite unexpected ones. Hart is really too intelligent a writer to do the bloke-lit thing - he keeps slipping in references to Schopenhauer next to the Smiths - and his attempt at the set-of-wacky-mates trope is pretty dismal. The love story, though, is a treat: truly beautiful and moving almost to tears."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
