The televison analyst may have forged a reputation as a ball-playing defender and jokes he \"never made a tackle\" but the man who won 26 Scottish caps is adamant about the tactics Walter Smith should employ against the likes of Thierry Henry in the Group B encounter. Hansen said: \"All right, the French will be terribly hard opposition and a lot of their players play in the Premiership, some are brilliant but they can be beaten. Scotland have to play a typical Scottish style. Get into them quick and don't let them settle and if they do that, we have a chance. Henry is a fantastic player and one of the best in the world. But if you can get in about him quick and get after him, then I have seen that sometimes he hasn't been so good.\" When pressed on exactly how the Scottish defence should deal with the prolific striker, Hansen replied: \"Give him a whack early on. Legitimately, of course. That will help. If you are away from home, under pressure and you get a kick, then it might put you back; get your foot in. Scotland can't give him time and space to play, because he will crucify you if you do that.\" Hansen has also expressed his admiration for Smith, who has overseen a rapid upturn in the team's fortunes since replacing Berti Vogts. He added: \"The fact that everyone is so excited about the France game speaks volumes for what is happening. There was a period of doom and gloom, with no hope or optimism, and that has all changed. It's a tribute to Walter and his players.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
