Sessegnon made his first top\u2011flight appearance in the 2-0 home defeat by Crystal Palace last weekend and will confront Tottenham Hotspur, one of the elite clubs who has closely monitored his eye-catching progress over recent seasons, at Wembley on Saturday. The 18-year-old, who could be fast-tracked into Gareth Southgate\u2019s England set-up for the autumn internationals, attracted tentative interest from rivals over the summer but Fulham never considered selling their prize asset before their return to the top division. \u201cI must be happy [he\u2019s still here] because Ryan Sessegnon is one of the most important players from last season,\u201d said Jokanovic, who saw the club spend more than \u00a3100m on 12 new players in the summer window. Eight of those signings played a part last Saturday. \u201cWe trust he can help us in this challenge that is immediately ahead of us. He\u2019s one of the longest-serving players to play in this team, so he is one man who doesn\u2019t give you so many problems [in terms of integration]. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t know if he is on the pitch because you don\u2019t hear so many times his voice but his work is really good. He always pushes really hard, he wants to improve himself, his teammates and the team. I don\u2019t remember any mistakes. All of us can make some mistakes during training or in a game but this kid is always focused on trying to improve, trying to learn, trying to adapt himself for each situation.\u201d Fulham will travel to Wembley, where they won the play-off final in May, with defensive concerns. Denis Odoi is completing a two-match ban, while neither Tim Ream nor Alfie Mawson has been able to train as yet after injury problems. The latter, a \u00a315m signing from Swansea City, will join the group for the first time on Tuesday. Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Aguissa, secured from Marseille as one of a quintet of new arrivals on deadline day, has trained and could be involved, and Joe Bryan is fit despite limping off on Saturday. Timothy Fosu-Mensah, loaned from Manchester United, may also feature. \u201cWe need time, like all the teams, because it\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Jokanovic, who remains in talks with the club over a new contract. \u201cWe must be patient and let the new players adjust. I believe we signed quality players but, without any work in our style or with their teammates, it\u2019s so complicated for them. Step by step we expect we will improve.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
