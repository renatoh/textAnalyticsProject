In the gap between the banks of drizzle coming off the Quantocks, Ponting had Kevin Shine, the director of cricket, and the all-rounder Aaron Laraman bowl at him. \"He's brilliant,\" says Anderson. \"He was due to arrive from Australia before six yesterday morning but he was late. When he got to the ground I asked him if he'd play last night. No heavy-armed stuff, it was up to him. He just said, 'Sure. Of course. No problem'. \"It's always the same with the really top ones. They're no bother. It's the ones in between who always have the niggles and find something wrong.\" And for a man who has managed just a couple of hours' sleep in his club flat, he proves remarkably affable. Thursday night was not only the first time Ponting had played Twenty20, he says, it was the first time he had seen it. \"I enjoyed it, my first crack at Twenty20. I'd heard a bit about it over the last 12 months from the guys in the Australian team who have been here playing county cricket. It's great for the crowd. I think that's the best thing about it. The ground was full - so many young kids, which is fantastic.\" Things were very different three days earlier when he was captaining the Australia Test side for the first time on home soil in tropical Cairns. \"Shame we didn't win,\" he says about the draw with Sri Lanka. \"Cairns is a good place to play cricket at this time of the year - about 23 or 24 degrees (75F) every day. \"That was on the 13th, I think. The next morning I got the seven o'clock flight down to Sydney, spent a couple of hours there [he and his wife Rianna have bought a new home and she was left to do the move] and caught the plane to London.\" Taunton was the first place he captained Australia, in a three-day match on the last Ashes tour, and he says he already feels comfortable. However, before Christmas he will play in Holland and England again before flying off to India for what many see as the most mouth-watering series in the Test calendar. The Somerset deal was arranged by Jamie Cox, once Ponting's captain in Tasmania and now the batsman he will briefly replace on the county circuit. \"It looked as though we [Australia] were going to have a break around this time of year and I wanted to play some cricket - and, to tell you the truth, I think Jamie was keen on having a bit of a break as well,\" Ponting said yesterday before formally meeting the Somerset squad. \"When I first signed the deal it looked as though I was going to be coming here in two stints but we had other cricket put on . . . the Darwin and Cairns things [the Sri Lanka series] and now we have this one-day thing in Holland in about five weeks' time and that's cut my time down.\" In Holland Australia will play India and Pakistan, returning to England for the ICC Trophy. That should take him up to the end of September and then comes the pre-Christmas tour of India, starting in October, which Ponting believes is \"going to be one of the biggest series ever played\". Steve Waugh, Ponting's predecessor, failed in India and Ponting says the way Sourav Ganguly's side played in the drawn series in Australia last year \"surprised us a bit\". Australia, he says, may have to shelve their fast-scoring pressure game and adopt a more patient style if he is to succeed where Waugh did not. \"It's a different game over there. You really do have to be a lot more patient and work harder for your runs. In fact it got us into trouble at Adelaide where we scored 600 in the first innings [of which Ponting made 242] and lost.\" But then next summer, after touring New Zealand, it is the Ashes series here and few would bet against the steamroller style returning, although Ponting, becoming cautious, denies that Australia ever formally \"sat down and said that we want to score at four an over\". But, he says: \"It's strange how that worked out. You look at our Test game now and it's pretty much an extended one-day game. Batsmen are getting 200 in a day, which is the result of one-day cricket. Their skills at being able to score quicker are getting a lot better.\" Not all his current Test team will play in the Ashes, though, given the Australian selectors' cold-blooded approach to players' sell-by dates. \"The last thing you want is five or six senior players going out of the squad at the same time,\" Ponting says. But Shane Warne? \"Warney's Warney. In the second innings in Cairns I bowled him 37 overs straight and he loved every moment of it. He's fitter than he has been for a long time and bowling very well, so he's going to be around for a while yet.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
