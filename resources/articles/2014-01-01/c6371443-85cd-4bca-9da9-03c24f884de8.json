The second strings of England and Ireland meet at Kingsholm, Sharples' home ground, where Lancaster will cast an eye over a number of players hoping to impress before the Six Nations, which starts for his side next Saturday against France in Paris. The Gloucester wing last played for England against Australia in November 2012 but was called into the Saxons squad as a late replacement for the injured Tom Varndell. Northampton's Calum Clark will lead the side but Sharples is the most capped player selected by the RFU's head of international development, Joe Lydon, in a team containing seven Saxons debutants. The 24-year-old has played four times for the full England side and, despite a difficult domestic campaign for Gloucester, is still confident that he can secure a place in the squad for this summer's tour of New Zealand. \"I'm happy with the fact that I've won four caps, that's a big achievement but I'm not content with that. I want to progress, I've got one eye [on] the World Cup and [am] hoping I can have some involvement in that,\" said Sharples. \"I've been given this fantastic opportunity to play for the Saxons at Kingsholm, which I have done before. I've got everything to play for and in a couple of weeks I'll be back at my club again. I'll have to focus on that New Zealand tour and try and stake a claim for that. \"If it [were] easy playing for England, then everyone would do it. You just give it your best crack. I've been fortunate to have been in around that mix for a couple of years now: unfortunately I haven't been able to kick on and cement down a starting position. \"I'm under no illusions [about] where I am as a player and where Gloucester are as a team. I don't think I'm a worse player than I was a couple of years ago, I think I'm a better player. I don't feel like I'm out of form but rugby is swings and roundabouts, you see how much things can change in a week.\" The Bath winger Anthony Watson will start for the Saxons after being released temporarily from England's Six Nations squad to gain senior international experience. Watson is joined by the fellow debutants, Sam Hill, Alex Waller, Charlie Matthews, Luke Wallace, Dave Ewers and Clark. Clark, the Northampton flanker, is hoping the game will represent a turning point in his career, having been banned for 32 weeks in 2012 for breaking the arm of Leicester's Rob Hawkins. \"Everyone in life deals with setbacks,\" said Clark. \"You can feel sorry for yourself or you can come up, stand up and take responsibility for your failures, your mistakes or your errors of judgment, and you can do something about it. \"I work really hard at looking in the mirror, dealing with the things that have happened. This means a lot to me and it's something I'm really proud of, to be given the responsibility and hopefully go out there and do us proud at the weekend.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
