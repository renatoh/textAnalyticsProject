According to the Hollywood Reporter, Gotham City Sirens will reunite the star with her Suicide Squad director, David Ayer. Robbie will also act as executive producer. The project will be scripted by Geneva Robertson-Dworet, who is also behind the forthcoming Tomb Raider reboot. The film will take its inspiration from a recent comic series about murderous women from Batman\u2019s past. Quinn is the only confirmed character as yet but other potential villains include Catwoman and Poison Ivy. \u201cI\u2019m so not done playing that character yet and there\u2019s so much more to do with her, I think, and as anyone who\u2019s read the comics knows, there\u2019s a million different storylines to explore,\u201d Robbie said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much you can do in the DC Universe, so I think it would be cool.\u201d Despite a troubled production and negative reviews, Suicide Squad was a big hit for Warner Bros, making $745m worldwide. Robbie\u2019s character had previously been suggested as the first to headline a spinoff given her popularity. A Suicide Squad sequel and a standalone Deadshot film are also in development. It also joins DC\u2019s other forthcoming films: Wonder Woman, Justice League, The Flash, Aquaman, Man of Steel 2 and Ben Affleck\u2019s The Batman. Robbie has a busy slate ahead with roles in the noir thriller Terminal, a biopic of the author AA Milne, a live-action Peter Rabbit movie and a drama based on the life of the skater Tonya Harding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
