Mar\u00e7al was forced across from the left of the three Lyon central defenders to cover as Gnabry, turning inside, took the ball down. Mar\u00e7al checked back but found his way blocked by Thomas M\u00fcller, making a run from the centre out to the right. Marcelo had already been distracted by M\u00fcller\u2019s move across him so his weight was going left as Gnabry flashed by to his right. What followed from Gnabry was brilliant, but the avenue along which he charged before hammering a shot \u2013 with his weaker foot \u2013 into the top corner, was created by M\u00fcller\u2019s movement from in to out. It was a typical contribution from a player who has scored 199 goals for Bayern, but whose value to them is far greater than that. This season is becoming a personal vindication for him after he was one of three players culled by Jogi L\u00f6w as he prepared for the Euros. At 30, M\u00fcller is clearly not finished; in terms of his maturity and his understanding of the game, he may never have been better. And after four successive semi-final defeats, it will be a relief to have a third Champions League final to play in. M\u00fcller had a key role in Pep Guardiola\u2019s semi-final psychodramas, which make up the first three of those last-four exits. In 2014 M\u00fcller, having been left on the bench for the extremely unfortunate 1-0 away defeat to Real Madrid, played from the start in the second as Bayern were eviscerated 4-0 on the break. In 2015, he played in both legs as Bayern, having been hammered 3-0 away to Barcelona, lost 5-3 on aggregate. And then, most significantly, he was left out of the away leg in 2016 against Atl\u00e9tico as Guardiola preferred to use Arturo Vidal and Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara in front of Xabi Alonso. Bayern lost 1-0 but the message was clear: in a game that demanded control, Guardiola didn\u2019t trust M\u00fcller. When he came on with 20 minutes remaining, Bayern did become more susceptible to the counter. He started the second leg (and missed a penalty) and, while Bayern were again unlucky, it was hard to avoid the sense that by playing M\u00fcller ahead of Thiago, Guardiola had opened them up to just that sort of misfortune. This is part of the enigma of M\u00fcller. He was brilliant for the national side at the 2010 World Cup when L\u00f6w played a counter-attacking game and very effective again in 2014 in Brazil. In 2018, he was a victim of L\u00f6w\u2019s confused evolution towards something supposedly more expansive. In that light, M\u00fcller\u2019s form since Hansi Flick replaced Niko Kovac in November could be cast as a rebuke to his national manager, as though his mind has been refocused by the snub, by having a point to prove. And perhaps there is an element of that. But more significant is the fact that Bayern\u2019s style of football has returned to M\u00fcller\u2019s strengths. It\u2019s not counterattacking as such, but Flick\u2019s approach is very characteristic of the modern Bundesliga, a game based in transitions. It is certainly not based on control: just as Barcelona created chances by getting behind the defensive line on Friday, so too did Lyon. And that suits M\u00fcller. He is not a player to play the safe pass and retain possession. \u201cI consciously take risks in my game,\u201d he said in an interview as long ago as 2011. \u201cOn the direct route towards the goal I often try to do things that may be great in terms of the idea, but difficult to do. Mistakes happen, but you have to say to yourself: it\u2019s gone, I\u2019ll try again next time. In reports it sometimes says: he tried a lot, but failed. Yes, then it just didn\u2019t work out. I try a lot and there are a lot of failures.\u201d It was in that same interview that, asked to describe himself as a player, M\u00fcller coined the term \u201cRaumdeuter\u201d. A pun on \u201cTraumdeuter\u201d \u2013 an interpreter of dreams, like Sigmund Freud or Daniel \u2013 it means something like an interpreter of space, and it\u2019s remarkable for two reasons. Firstly, as he showed in his awkward attempts to popularise \u201cLewangoalski\u201d on Friday, word play seems not to come naturally to him. But more, because it shows such acute self-awareness. Space is what he deals in; manipulating it is what is what he does. M\u00fcller is a little clumsy. His oddly long arms perhaps make him look a little gawkier than he actually is. He isn\u2019t a great dribbler. He isn\u2019t the cleanest striker of the ball. He isn\u2019t unduly quick or strong. But his reading of the game, his instinct for where space and chances will appear and his work rate are remarkable. M\u00fcller didn\u2019t touch the ball in the immediate buildup to any of the three goals. Statistically his contribution didn\u2019t register. And yet his movement was integral to each goal. It was his run to the near post that dragged Mar\u00e7al away from Robert Lewandowski in the heart of the box in the build-up to the second. It was he who was fouled, having regained possession, late on high up the pitch, to win the free-kick for the third. This was one of M\u00fcller\u2019s quieter games and yet he was still instrumental in the win. In his idiosyncratic way, he is central to the Flick style."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
