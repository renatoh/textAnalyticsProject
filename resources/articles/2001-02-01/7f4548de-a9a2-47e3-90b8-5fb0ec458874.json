This is not as naive a question as it sounds. For if education ministers find themselves short of bedtime reading in the next week or so, they might be well advised to acquire a copy of the Labour government's Human Rights Act, which came into force in October last year. I would recommend, specifically, that they study article 9, which guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and religion. And, when they have read it, the first paragraph may give them nightmares. The point is that, if we all have the right in law to these freedoms, it opens up the prospect of a legal challenge to the government's plan to expand the number of church secondary schools. These schools would, presumably, incorporate Anglican, Catholic or Muslim beliefs into the everyday running of the school, and require children - and their parents - to observe the rituals and customs of that faith. They might well, as some primary schools already do, require regular attendance at Christian services (or a mosque or a synagogue), as a condition of getting into the school. For parents who do not have religious beliefs, this poses a dilemma. If the only decent state secondary school in your area happens to be single-faith, do you pretend to convictions you don't have - and quite possibly find offensive - or jeopardise your children's education? I already have friends who are thinking seriously about starting to attend mass, even though they loathed their own Catholic upbringing, in order to get their children into a primary school with good results. This is particularly disturbing for mothers who are aware of the impact of the Vatican's entrenched misogyny on their own lives, and reluctant to expose their daughters to it. This is, in effect, a form of discrimination against secular parents and their families. What makes it even more astonishing, at the beginning of the 21st century, is that it is being proposed by the state. The government has no business promoting religion, and what it does not seem to have realised, when it signalled its intention to expand the number of single-faith schools earlier this month, is that parents now have recourse to the courts if they wish to avoid making either of these unacceptable choices. The first paragraph of article 9 reads in full: \"everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance\". It is abundantly clear that a child sent to a church school, where he or she is compelled to subscribe to a single faith as a condition of being there, is being denied the rights conferred by the Human Rights Act. This is not an argument that aspects of religion should not be taught in schools; unlike religious bigots, who despise atheists like myself - I have the letters to prove it - I am happy for it to be there, as an optional subject and taught in the context of cultural studies. That is what living in a plural society means: giving people, and that includes children, a choice about what they believe in. It does not mean, as happened to the children of some friends of mine in an Oxfordshire village, being sent home from school with instructions to write a letter to God. What I object to is children being indoctrinated in a single faith, at taxpayers' expense, and their parents forced to go along with it. This is no longer, as I have pointed out before, a Christian country, given that less than a million people, out of a population of 60m, attend Anglican services on Sundays. Even if it were, it is wrong in principle for state-funded schools to promote one religion over another, and to neglect other systems of thought, including humanism and atheism. I recognised this myself as a teenager, with comical results. Pointing out that I was not compelled by law to attend the parts of morning assembly that involved Christian worship, I declared that I would not in future take part in it. This caused consternation, though not because I was the first child in my state school in Hertfordshire to exercise this right. The others were girls from other religions, Catholics or observant Jews; what the school had not previously encountered was a conscientious objector who just wanted to read Jackie. What will happen to the next generation of 14-year-olds, packed off to Tony Blair's church secondary schools against their will? It is quite possible that some of them will decide that they don't want to attend mass or the local mosque; will the single-faith schools proposed in the green paper allow them to exercise freedom of conscience? It is fortunate that, in a society increasingly aware of the importance of universal human rights, an act now exists to protect them. The irony, that it is the creation of this peculiarly narrow-minded government, is almost too delicious to contemplate. comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
