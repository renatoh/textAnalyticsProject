Both shows are held in Las Vegas, attract many of the same speakers, and some of the same audience. ZD Net News, comparing the shows, reckons CES has won the latest round. The story, here, quotes a taxi driver at CES saying: \"Comdex sucks. At least most of these people know what a tip is.\" Well, Comdex attracts more techical people and fewer marketing types. The geekier ones are supposed to arrive at Comdex with one shirt and one $100 bill and spend the week without changing either."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
