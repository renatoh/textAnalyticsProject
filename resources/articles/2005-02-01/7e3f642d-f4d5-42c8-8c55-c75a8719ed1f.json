A high level meeting between the two countries concluded with Iranian vice-president, Mohammad Reza Aref, telling a press conference that the Islamic republic was \"ready to help Syria on all grounds to confront threats\". The Syrian prime minister, Naji al-Otari, said it was a necessary alliance because both countries faced \"several challenges\". Jitteriness in the region was exacerbated today when Iranian state television initially blamed reports of an explosion near the Bushehr nuclear power plant on an unidentified aircraft firing a missile. The Iranian media has been full of stories of unidentified flying objects in recent weeks, and Tehran accused the US today of flying unmanned spy planes over the country in a search for evidence of what Washington calls Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iran insists it is only developing a civilian nuclear programme to meet its energy needs. Claims from the Iranian intelligence minister, Ali Yunesi, that \"most of the shining objects that our people see in Iran's airspace are American spying equipment\" chimed with a report in the Washington Post that the drones have been flying over Iran for nearly a year. George Bush calls Iran \"the world's primary state sponsor of terror\" and US officials charge Syria with allowing Palestinian militants and Iraqi insurgents to operate from its soil. Syria's ambassador to the United States told CNN that the front was not an anti-US alliance. \"We do not want to form a front against anybody, particularly not against the United States,\" he told the channel. \"Syria is trying to engage constructively with the United States. We are not the enemies of the United States, and we do not want to be drawn into such an enmity.\" Relations between the US and Syria are less strained than those with Iran - a member of Mr Bush's \"axis of evil\" - but tensions have been rising since the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri on Tuesday. US officials do not specifically blame Damascus for the assassination, but argue that Syria's military presence and its political power-broking role are generally responsible for Lebanon's instability. The Bush administration withdrew its ambassador to Damascus yesterday to express its \"profound outrage\" at Mr Hariri's death. Mourners at his funeral procession today called on Syrian president, Bashar Assad, to \"remove your dogs from Beirut\". In further signs of a tough new stance, the Reuters news agency reported that US officials were considering new sanctions against Syria over its refusal to pull troops out of Lebanon and the belief that it lets Palestinian militants and Iraqi insurgents operate from within its borders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
