He had long nurtured ambitions to lead his party, but finally gave up on them when he was one of the casualties of the 2015 election massacre of the Liberal Democrats. He took his ejection from parliament to be the death of his political career. \u201cIf you\u2019d asked me six months ago, I assumed my exile was permanent,\u201d he smiles. So he threw himself into a post-political life. He tried his hand at writing a thriller. He traded on his training as an economist and experience as business secretary in the coalition years. \u201cI was going around universities being a wise man.\u201d Though he had made a promise to his local party that he would stand again for the Lib Dems in Twickenham if there were an early election, he assumed it wasn\u2019t a pledge that would have to be redeemed. \u201cI was also doing ballroom dance competitions in Blackpool. I\u2019d established quite a good new lifestyle.\u201d Then came the snap election, the departure of Tim Farron as Lib Dem leader after the party\u2019s disappointing performance and the resurrection of Cable as an MP. A decade after he had ruled himself out of running for the job on the grounds of his age, he became party leader at 74. Looking at the beaten-up state of the Lib Dems, some might wonder whether it was worth sacrificing that \u201cgood new lifestyle\u201d he enjoyed out of parliament to take charge of a party that has only 12 MPs and is flatlining beneath 10 points in the opinion polls. \u201cThere is this old expression, \u2018there\u2019s nothing as ex as an ex-MP\u2019. You are aware of it. I realised when it came to the crunch, I did miss being part of the action.\u201d Much is written about the hunger of young ambition. Cable is an example of how old ambition can be even hungrier. After such a long wait for his chance to lead, and knowing as he must that he doesn\u2019t have all the time in the world, here is a man in a hurry. He looks energised, rather than daunted, by the challenge of dealing with what some of his colleagues call an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d for the Lib Dems. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty dawn to dusk stuff,\u201d he says cheerfully of his life as leader. \u201cI go to bed late. I go to bed very late.\u201d One Lib Dem peer recently complained that Cable was still firing off emails about this or that long after midnight. So he stopped sending the emails \u2013 and started sending post-midnight texts instead. He is the oldest person to lead a British political party since Winston Churchill. \u201cIn the first two days after I became leader, the questions I had from journalists were all about age. Hardly anybody has said a word about it since.\u201d After a period when party leaders got more and more youthful, the trend has suddenly reversed. Theresa May is older than David Cameron. Jeremy Corbyn has decades on Ed Miliband. \u201cI think it\u2019s largely a coincidence, but to some extent events have removed the taboo on age. When things have been screwed up and we\u2019re in a mess, people who have shown a certain amount of endurance and resilience, those are the kind of qualities that people value a bit more maybe.\u201d When he became leader, there was a notion around that Cable would be a caretaker for two years or so and then hand over to a younger torch-bearer, who most presume would be the party\u2019s deputy leader, Jo Swinson. \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d he says, bluntly rubbishing the idea that there was a succession deal between them when she decided not to run for the top job. \u201cI\u2019m not putting up a limit. I do it for as long as I need to do it.\u201d One of his tasks at the party conference in Bournemouth is simply to lift morale. Though the Lib Dems received a surge of new members following the Brexit referendum, this did not translate into a boost at the June election. Their vote was down even on the slaughter they suffered in 2015. His priority is \u201cgetting up the vote share\u201d from its current miserable level. \u201cWhen we\u2019re in single figures, there is an issue about how credible we are. I\u2019m trying to get more and more exposure and trying to get more definition. Get some clear messages across. The key thing is to get our own troops and the public perception back to the idea that we can win.\u201d He identifies \u201ctwo strands\u201d to his attempt to revive the party. \u201cOne of them is issue based.\u201d The Lib Dems will have clear things to say about addressing inequality and inter-generational unfairness. \u201cThe other is projecting the idea that I\u2019m an alternative prime minister.\u201d We clearly look incredulous, because he then insists: \u201cYou may blink, but that\u2019s the message I need to get across and want to get across.\u201d It is true that we live in an era of extreme volatility where yesterday\u2019s unthinkable can become today\u2019s reality, but all the same. To go from a dozen MPs to No 10 sounds, ahem, on the ambitious side. Him as prime minister? Really? \u201cGiven the alternatives, I think that\u2019s plausible,\u201d he contends. He cites Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory in France and Justin Trudeau\u2019s rise to the premiership of Canada as evidence that \u201cin these times of political upheaval all kinds of strange things can happen\u201d. While even the most optimistic Lib Dem may struggle to share his belief that he could become prime minister, this assertion does illuminate how he wants to lead the party. Under Farron, the Lib Dems fell back on their old tradition of being essentially a party of protest. Cable has no time for that, seeking to pitch them as a potential party of government. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been seen as even bidding for that ground,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing a plucky third party is not my view. It\u2019s got to be that we are a serious party with a serious leader who can run the country.\u201d The more realistic prospect is that they might at some point in the future find themselves again in coalition. \u201cI can\u2019t see it at the moment,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you can\u2019t indefinitely rule it out. Not under the present leadership [of the Tories or Labour] and not under the present circumstances, but in the longer term \u2013 who knows?\u201d Cable has already started setting out a policy stall that concentrates on fairness and opportunity. He puts emphasis on doing more for the less affluent by taxing wealth, a strand of Liberal thinking since John Stuart Mill. \u201cWe have to be in favour of the taxation of wealth. Otherwise, fighting inequality doesn\u2019t mean a great deal,\u201d he declares. Cable started his political career as a Labour councillor in Glasgow in the 1970s and then joined the moderate breakaway to the SDP in the 1980s. He has always been on the social democratic wing of his party. During the coalition years he was the Lib Dem member of the cabinet who found it most conspicuously uncomfortable being in government with the Tories. His emphasis on inequality is consistent with his career. But we suggest that there is a big problem here. Why would voters who want less inequality and an end to austerity choose the Lib Dems when they can go the full Jeremy Corbyn? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have hope and you\u2019ve got to have realism at the same time,\u201d he responds. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have economic literacy as well as progressive instincts. We can do both.\u201d Corbyn, he argues, can\u2019t offer that combination because \u201ca lot of the talk is still very much 1970s kind of soft Trot, as we used to call it in the battles in the Labour party. \u2018We support strikes to break the pay cap.\u2019 That\u2019s old, hardline Bennite stuff. But I know there are a lot of good people in the Labour party who are trying to recapture some of what you and I would call social democracy. Those latent fundamental divisions between revolutionary socialism and social democracy are going to play out.\u201d He is \u201cnot predicting mass defections\u201d from Labour to the Lib Dems, but \u201cthere are a whole lot of issues where the big schisms in the Labour party could well reappear\u201d. One continuity with his predecessor is to define the Lib Dems as the party of \u201cexit from Brexit\u201d: unequivocally opposed to leaving the EU and pledged to a referendum on whatever deal the government finally negotiates. He will be joining an anti-Brexit march on the Tory party conference, busting the convention that leaders do not mount protests at the conferences of rival parties. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve become a marcher again. I used to do this in my youth. I\u2019ll be speaking to the march, I\u2019ll be doing my Jeremy Corbyn on a soap box.\u201d Their anti-Brexit pitch was a disappointing failure for the Lib Dems at the election. Though 48% backed remain in the referendum, the Lib Dems ended up with a vote share of less than 8%. This, he thinks, was because it was \u201cpremature\u201d. Back in June, \u201cthe minute I hit the doorsteps, I realised it wasn\u2019t quite on target. The remain constituents were saying: \u2018We\u2019ve had this referendum. We don\u2019t want another one. Just for the moment. Let\u2019s just get on with it, see what the government can do. And the problem with the phrase \u2018second referendum\u2019 was it did look as if you were trying to run it again.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re now in a very different situation,\u201d he adds, \u201cand I think what we\u2019re saying will resonate.\u201d He is in regular discussion with Labour MPs about how to coordinate opposition to the government. That includes a recent and lengthy discussion with Keir Starmer, Labour\u2019s principal spokesman on Brexit. On many of the crucial questions facing parliament, the key to the outcome will be whether there are enough Tory MPs prepared to join hands with the opposition parties to amend the Brexit legislation in defiance of their own government. \u201cThat\u2019s the big uncertainty over the next six months. Whether there will be a critical mass of them. It will take quite a lot to get those people to rebel.\u201d Talking to Cable, you get the strong impression that he thinks the parliamentary struggles cannot deliver a softer Brexit because it is not really available as an option. It is \u201cwildly implausible\u201d that \u201cthe Europeans will keel over and give us a pretty good deal\u201d. It is \u201cmuch more likely that the soft Brexit option, the smooth transition, will just never happen. There\u2019s too much division in the Tory party over it.\u201d He points to the latest intervention by Boris Johnson \u2013 \u201cthe Poundland Donald Trump\u201d \u2013 as an example of the forces in the Conservative party pushing for an \u201cextreme Brexit\u201d. Even if May now wants a softer Brexit, \u201cher position is very weak within her own party, not just in terms of numbers in parliament. I can\u2019t see that happening.\u201d \u201cSo we are faced, whenever the crisis point comes, with extreme Brexit. We crash out. Or you have exit from Brexit. And then, who were the people who said this is going to happen? And who are the people who\u2019ve got an answer to it or at least a way forward?\u201d At that point, or so he hopes, his party will receive its reward in public esteem for being the people who have always warned that Brexit was a disastrous idea. It may be a while before that happens, but then one thing this Lib Dem leader knows about is waiting for his chance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
