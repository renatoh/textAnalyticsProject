After particularly negative lines of questioning from the assembled media, he finally cracked as he walked away having finished a radio interview. \"Fucking great,\" he muttered, \"just what I needed.\" He may not have enjoyed the questioning, but he enjoyed the round itself even less. \"It was very disappointing that performance,\" he said, \"that was awful. The last tee shot there, to thin a two-iron like that and not make the fairway was a desperate, desperate shot and you can't compete when it's like that. I only had 170 yards. Terrible.\" Before the championship started Montgomerie emphasised the need for a good start, and then birdied two of the first three holes. \"It's even more disappointing because I didn't continue from there. I will try and rally but I am not swinging the club the way I did even at Loch Lomond last week. I don't know what goes wrong. Never mind, never mind.\" A few moments later, the sentiments were somewhat stronger than that. Padraig Harrington, being a qualified accountant, often plays a game appropriate to that station and did so yesterday in compiling a two-under 69. \"It was my aim,\" he said, \"not to blow myself out of the tournament on the first day and I haven't done myself any harm.\" The problem with this kind of thinking, though, is that it ignores the fact that yesterday was perfect for scoring and that there might not be another such all week. Nick Faldo, normally completely self-contained, played an emotional round, the predominant feeling expressed being that of disappointment or even despair. He clearly did not consider he was competing as well as he had hoped and, after bogeying the short 7th, rested his head against his hands on the sign announcing the 8th. Later, having hit a poor tee shot at the 10th and a poor recovery just short of the green, he proceeded to putt the ball off the green on the other side, almost into a bunker. He subsided on his haunches, head in hands again, as he pondered an unbelievably bad shot. He finished the round flat on his back. Having found a one-foot-in-and-one-foot-out stance in a bunker at the 18th, he slashed at the ball and fell backwards on to the grass before bogeying for a 73."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
