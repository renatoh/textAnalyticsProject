S\u00e9rgio Moro became an A-list celebrity in Brazil for leading the historic \u201cCar Wash\u201d anti-corruption investigation. He controversially took his job last year after helping jail Bolsonaro\u2019s key election rival, former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and has been widely tipped as a future president himself. But Moro\u2019s political future was thrown into doubt on Sunday after the Intercept began publishing a series of expos\u00e9s based on what it called \u201ca vast trove\u201d of secret documents provided by an anonymous source. The Intercept said its \u201cSecret Brazil Archive\u201d reports \u2013 which contained compromising excerpts from mobile phone chats between Moro and Car Wash prosecutors \u2013 showed he had engaged in \u201cimproper and unethical plotting\u201d designed to ensure Lula\u2019s imprisonment. Lula was prevented from taking part in last year\u2019s presidential election \u2013 which polls suggested he would have won \u2013 after being convicted of bribe taking and corruption by Moro in 2017. He is currently serving an almost nine-year sentence in southern Brazil. Moro has rejected accusations of wrongdoing as \u201csensationalist\u201d smears and his supporters branded the leaks a criminal conspiracy designed to undermine the former judge and Bolsonaro\u2019s administration. But on Tuesday \u2013 as Brazilian politicians braced for further revelations promised by the Intercept - there were calls for Moro\u2019s removal. \u201cMoro has to go,\u201d said Guilherme Boulos, a left-wing leader some see as a potential heir to Lula. \u201cThere is now compelling evidence of his involvement in illegal and unethical practices \u2026 Moro no longer has the political or moral capacity to run the justice ministry.\u201d The conservative Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper said it believed Moro should resign. The Intercept\u2019s leaks revealed \u201ca totally inappropriate \u2013 and possibly illegal \u2013 relationship\u201d between Moro and prosecutors \u201cwith legal and political implications that are still hard to gauge\u201d, the newspaper said in a scathing editorial. \u201cOther ministers have been sacked for far less,\u201d it pointed out. Jos\u00e9 Roberto de Toledo, a political journalist from the magazine Piau\u00ed, said he did not believe Bolsonaro would immediately dismiss his minister. \u201cBut Moro\u2019s image has been damaged and Bolsonaro is clearly on the defensive, not wanting to tie himself too closely to Moro because of the chance he might have to sack him,\u201d Toledo said, pointing to Bolsonaro\u2019s failure to personally defend Moro. So far, Bolsonaro\u2019s only public statement of support has come through a spokesperson who insisted Moro enjoyed the president\u2019s \u201ccomplete trust\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think he will fire him today,\u201d Toledo said. \u201c[But] until Sunday night if someone had said: \u2018Bolsonaro might sack Moro,\u2019 you\u2019d have said: \u2018You\u2019re mad \u2013 you\u2019re delusional.\u2019 Today it\u2019s a possibility \u2013 not a huge possibility but a possibility.\u201d Eliane Cantanh\u00eade, a political columnist for the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, said Moro was likely to survive the Intercept\u2019s disclosures thanks to his hero status among many Brazilians. \u201cDespite being detested by the left \u2026 Moro went down in history and became internationally known for running the greatest anti-corruption investigation in the world. He has immense popular support.\u201d \u201cDoes it look good for Moro? No it doesn\u2019t \u2026 But is it enough to destroy his public image? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said. But Cantanh\u00eade sensed nervousness and caution in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, that the Intercept might have \u201ca bomb\u201d up its sleeve. \u201cNobody wants to defend Moro only for more things to come out.\u201d Brian Winter, the editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly, said it was possible the leaks could lead to Lula\u2019s release. \u201cFor this kind of conduct to have been revealed is at the very least devastating for the image of the Car Wash probe and it could also result in the nullification of the case against Lula,\u201d said Winter, who knows Moro and expressed concern over his decision to take a job in Bolsonaro\u2019s government last year. The shockwaves would also be felt across the region, in countries such as Peru and Argentina where major corruption investigations linked to Car Wash are playing out. \u201cPeople in the anti-corruption community around Latin America were furious with S\u00e9rgio Moro when he accepted this job last year [because of the appearance of political impropriety] and they are 10 times as angry now \u2026 because it affects their work,\u201d Winter said. \u201cIt allows the corrupt to say: \u2018I am being unfairly targeted too.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
