He was 73. A statement from the Thompson family said: \u201cIt is with a heavy heart and a deep sense of grief that we share the passing of our brother, husband, father, and grandfather who died peacefully in Nashville surrounded by his family.\u201d The statement, which the Tennessean newspaper reported said Thompson died from a recurrence of lymphoma, added: \u201cFred believed that the greatness of our nation was defined by the hard work, faith, and honesty of its people. \u201cHe had an enduring belief in the exceptionalism of our country, and that America could provide the opportunity for any boy or girl, in any corner of our country, to succeed in life.\u201d Tributes to Thompson were instant. Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor now running for the Republican presidential nomination, used Twitter to say: \u201cFred Thompson lived an amazing life, he will be sorely missed. Columba and my prayers are with Jeri and his kids &amp; grandkids.\u201d The Republican operative Stuart Stevens alluded to Thompson\u2019s warm personality when he used Twitter to say: \u201cJust before narrating Bush film at \u201904 convention, Fred Thompson was enjoying adult beverage. Saw my nervous look. Laughed. Then nailed it.\u201d An attorney who worked on the Watergate hearings, Thompson became a successful character actor after playing himself in the 1985 film Marie, based on a case in which he represented a whistleblower who exposed corruption in the government of Tennessee. He went on to star in the TV series Law &amp; Order. He played a fictional president in Last Best Chance (2005) and real-life president Ulysses S Grant in a 2007 TV movie, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. He provided the voice of another occupant of the White House, Andrew Jackson, in Rachel and Andrew Jackson: A Love Story (2001). In the 1993 Clint Eastwood hit In the Line of Fire, he played a White House chief of staff. Other film credits included The Hunt for Red October and Days of Thunder (both 1990), Cape Fear and Necessary Roughness (1991), and Secretariat (2010). On television he made appearances in Sex and the City, The Good Wife and many more series. Thompson entered politics in 1994, when he was elected to fill the remainder of the Senate term vacated by the then vice-president, Al Gore. He won re-election and represented Tennessee as a Republican until the 2002 elections, in which he chose not to run. In 2007, he took a break from acting to run for the Republican nomination for president. Unable to gain purchase in the primary race, he dropped out in late January 2008. One of the lines most famously attributed to Thompson compared his post-law career choices: \u201cAfter two years in Washington, I often long for the realism and sincerity of Hollywood.\u201d The Tennessee senator Lamar Alexander, who took over Thompson\u2019s seat on Capitol Hill, on Sunday issued a statement which said: \u201cVery few people can light up the room the way Fred Thompson did. He used his magic as a lawyer, actor, Watergate counsel and United States senator to become one of our country\u2019s most principled and effective public servants. \u201cHe was my friend for nearly 50 years. I will miss him greatly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
