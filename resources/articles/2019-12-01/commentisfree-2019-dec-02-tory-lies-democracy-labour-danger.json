For Boris Johnson, the murder of two remarkable young people who were committed to helping others is merely a campaign prop. Where others reacted with horror and grief, Johnson and his team saw an opportunity to electioneer. That they used this as a chance to promote punitive penal policies which one of the victims, 25-year-old Jack Merritt, devoted his short life to fighting against, almost beggars belief. To bolster the case, the Tories again fall back on lies: Johnson claimed parliament blocked plans to prevent automatic early release of prisoners (false, it was passed by 16 votes); that opposition parties were to blame for the terrorist\u2019s release in 2012 (false); that Labour introduced legislation allowing the early release of terrorists (false); that Jeremy Corbyn wants to disband MI5 (false). The lies provide a shield from their own record: the decimation of prison and probation budgets. An ex-prosecutor even claims that Johnson told him that there wasn\u2019t enough money to fund deradicalisation programmes. Yet how to properly confront such deceit when so much of the media exists to facilitate rather than scrutinise or challenge the Conservative party? There is little if any demarcation between the Tory election apparatus and many British newspapers. They are one unified, integrated, ruthless machine \u2013 and should be treated as such. As front pages laud Johnson\u2019s manipulation of a horrific incident, the pleas of Merritt\u2019s father, David, go unanswered: \u201cDon\u2019t use my son\u2019s death, and his and his colleague\u2019s photos \u2013 to promote your vile propaganda. Jack stood against everything you stand for \u2013 hatred, division, ignorance.\u201d Then there is the Andrew Neil debacle. All leading politicians should face a level playing field during an election campaign: given the partisan loyalties of most newspapers, this is impossible, but it is the least we should expect from our public broadcaster. And yet the BBC responded to Friday\u2019s atrocity by performing a U-turn on their decision to block Johnson\u2019s interview with Andrew Marr until the prime minster agreed to subject himself to Neil\u2019s rottweiler treatment. The BBC instead allowed Johnson to use the atrocity to grandstand and repeat untruths which were only later challenged by a BBC Twitter account. The BBC has allowed terrorism to interfere with British democracy. As Phil Harding, the BBC\u2019s former controller of editorial policy and editor of the Today programme, put it, the BBC decision allowed Johnson \u201cto appear \u2018prime ministerial\u2019\u201d and made the attacks an \u201celection issue\u201d. The British right has long fantasised about privatising and gutting the BBC while much of the left has long criticised the corporation\u2019s editorial decision-making, but now even the centre is turning against it. This election campaign has been the BBC\u2019s nadir: from editing out Johnson being ridiculed by a Question Time audience \u2013 simply a mistake, we are told \u2013 to supinely publishing video of him eating scones in a fashion that would embarrass North Korea\u2019s official news agency. The counterweight to our rightwing press is fast being eroded. And then creeps in the idea that the problem lies with both sides of the political divide \u2013 muddy the waters, ascribe blame equally for dishonesty. It works, of course: speaking to voters on doorsteps across the country, I hear the constant refrain that \u201call politicians lie\u201d. But it\u2019s too easy an accusation to level, and one that is bolstered by casual asides from senior BBC presenters such as Emily Maitlis, like the idea that this is \u201cthe election of 2 billion trees and 50 thousand nurses \u2013 where numbers and accountability became meaningless\u201d. The comparison between Labour\u2019s mass tree-planting commitment \u2013 an achievable aim that has been accomplished in other countries \u2013 and a Tory policy on nurses which we know is bogus, because the figure includes retaining existing nurses, is hugely damaging. It is easy to conclude that this is merely barking at thunder. It rains on bank holidays, buses come in twos, and the media landscape favours the Conservatives. And it is certainly a deliberate tactic from the Tories to keep the left relentlessly bogged down in outrage at their lies. But if the Tories are allowed to lie unchallenged then our democracy will wither. While Labour should sped the remainder of the campaign focusing on the Tories\u2019 wretched record in government, the threat the party poses to the NHS and promoting its radical domestic agenda, it is beholden on those of us with a platform to challenge the Tories\u2019 systematic deceptions. The aim is not simply to defeat Johnson, but to defend a democracy in mortal danger. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 2 December 2019.
