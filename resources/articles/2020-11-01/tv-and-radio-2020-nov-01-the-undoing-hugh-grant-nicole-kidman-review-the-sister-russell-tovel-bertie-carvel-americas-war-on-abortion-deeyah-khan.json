Grant\u2019s ridiculously charming oncologist Jonathan Fraser is chatting to wife Grace (Kidman), a hugely bright therapist in her own right with a rich daddy (Donald Sutherland no less), over their immense New York breakfast bar, and over the head of their kid, Henry, a splendid young Noah Jupe, who just gets his dad\u2019s humour. \u201cKeep them protected from reality as long as possible, so when they do eventually emerge they start self-harming, isn\u2019t that the idea?\u201d says Grant\u2019s character, both setting up lightly the differences between gaunt British and marshmallow American humour, and giving us windows of insight into the family dynamic. And it\u2019s all about to go horribly wrong, of course. A murder, a particularly nasty one, and a hubby gone awol and more \u2013 I\u2019m happy not to provide spoilers, because for once it\u2019s not all instantly streamable \u2013 but I\u2019m up to episode five (of six) and safe to say still gripped. This is far more of a detectoral and courtroom thriller than the mainly psychological one that was BLL. Which has pros and cons. In the first episode we get the supreme pass-agg bitchinesses of the privileged schoolgate moms towards anyone younger, better boobed or, horror, scholarship-unwealthy. The gossamer sneers are sublime. But soon we will move to simple mystery. Kidman has the toughest job, having to inhabit a shell of, mainly, motherdom, without Grant\u2019s empathy or Sutherland\u2019s mephitic swagger, and pulls this off again of course with immense aplomb. It might be a little too free in its gleeful schadenfreude over trouble having the temerity to befall Wasps, and the Hispanic murderee is equally snubbed in hindsight as she was at those school gates, but it remains, through sheer quality, a keeper that will have you hooked until November\u2019s end. You\u2019ll surely have become used over the lockdown months to the frustrations that accompany an over-frizzed freezer. Granted, Russell Tovey is not stabbing with a broken spoon at the stalactites guarding a petrified garlic baguette and some petits pois just to save the faff of a corner-shop trip. He\u2019s more hacking at the frozen dress, embedded with his own guilty DNA, of a girl he\u2019s convinced he had a hand in murdering a decade ago (before somewhat rashly marrying her unknowing sister), while the body of a manic ghost hunter he has tried to murder lies twitching at his feet and armed cops batter at the door. But I think you\u2019ll find my general point remains. Towards the end of third episode of ITV\u2019s all-week spookathon The Sister it truly got rather stressy. Tovey\u2019s character, Nathan, seemed to honestly sweat as he hacked away at his fear and his guilt: there was sudden, genuine eek-to-mouth biting tension and a shocker of a reveal. The problem was that it took so bloody long to get there. I get what writer Neil Cross et al were aiming for, ratcheting up the spooksomeness nightly, but what with the endless retread shots of Nathan looking haunted (or simply clueless), the triple timelines that simply permitted Bertie Carvel to chew the scenery as the sinister Bob in three differing manky haircuts, Simone Ashley being forever cut and pasted in the backstory as either spangly party girl or more dead in a ditchy (yes, again, it\u2019s a girly dead in a ditch thing, sigh), this was a decent 90-minute Halloweeny twister crammed into a mere entire week. Even more timely, if rather more serious, was a searing piece on America\u2019s abortion stance, in which film-maker Deeyah Khan went to the heartlands of one cultural phenomenon that we islands may mightily pray is not about to be appropriated from America. In America\u2019s War on Abortion, we met the staunch Dr Yashica Robinson, an indefatigable soul with, by virtue of being a black feminist doctor who runs one of Alabama\u2019s three remaining abortion clinics and thus being top of a few nasty little lists, something of a haunted air about the eyes. We also went to a clinic in Wichita, Kansas, where they have windows on the top floor only, to deter snipers. Both beleaguered establishments provide services for victims of rape and incest, plus those whose babies have been diagnosed as \u201cincompatible with life\u201d, or a threat to the mother\u2019s life itself. Outside these criteria, unwed or reluctant mothers have to go, in many states, through horn\u2019d hoops \u2013 three checks on mental stability, 48 hours apart, despite the fact that they may have to drive, broke, 1,100 miles, and check in to a roach motel and be forcibly presented with ultrasound evidence of life. If Khan garners any criticism, it will be that she didn\u2019t find the sane counter-arguments, those who might want to make a lucid, sober, principled stance on behalf of the pro-life movement. Yet she tried, honestly she tried. She sat down a nice minister and his wife in their chintzy home and they made sense for, oooh, 12 seconds or so, then their heads began swivelling 360 degrees and they started telling her they \u201cjust knew\u201d what Jesus would think, as if He could somehow be co-opted into their highly specific (mid-1650s) worldview, like some obeisant sock puppet or turnip ghost. Khan also found Jennifer, a \u201creformed\u201d protester who has renounced violence and now contents herself with merely waggling graphic placards in the faces of recently traumatised weeping women. Yet Jennifer gave it away somewhat when she whispered, as a kindly little aside, that she knew the lead clinician to be in league with \u201cSatan or at least Wicca. Fact.\u201d By and large I loathe the wall-to-wall warnings bookending so much telly these days, the \u201csome viewers may find some scenes [tautologous, surely?] upsetting\u201d stuff before a cartoon vole loses a wee sock or some such. But even I had to walk, briefly, from the room when faced with some of the quotes and the snarling placards. \u201cBy God\u2019s law they should be stoned to death at the edge of the city\u201d; \u201cBlack lives don\u2019t matter here\u201d; \u201cNasty diseased bare-legged whores \u2026 \u201d Khan made this film after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but, rather crucially, before the appointment a few days ago of Amy Coney Barrett to the supreme court. Eight out of 10 white evangelists voted for Trump last time around. Between now and next week, an election will have been fought, so timing-wise I\u2019m going to sound just like Leslie Nielsen\u2019s doctor in Airplane!, entering the cockpit a good 20 seconds after they\u2019ve safely landed. Nevertheless, America: good luck. We\u2019re all counting on you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
