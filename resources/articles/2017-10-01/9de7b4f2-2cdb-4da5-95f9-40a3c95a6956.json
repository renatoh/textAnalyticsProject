Safe from the flames, he found himself with nothing more than his wallet and the clothes on his back. The 78-year-old retired carwash worker had kept his life savings in cash at home. The money, along with the home, are almost certainly gone. \u201cI have too many problems,\u201d Pacheco said in Spanish on Sunday, as he stood in line at the Fema emergency assistance center in Sonoma county, tears streaming down his face. \u201cI can\u2019t even think right now. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come next.\u201d As weather conditions finally shifted in their favor over the weekend, firefighters in northern California made significant progress in containing the series of wildfires that began ravaging the region on the night of 8 October. More than a dozen fires erupted that night amid unusually heavy winds, and the flames remained almost entirely uncontained for much of the week. The fires have thus far burned over 213,000 acres and destroyed approximately 5,700 structures, according to the state fire agency. Forty people died in last week\u2019s flames, making it the deadliest week in California wildfire history. On Monday, another fatality was reported after a driver delivering water to the fire lines was killed when his truck overturned. About 100 people remain unaccounted for in Sonoma County, where more than 1,700 were at one point listed as missing. \u201cThe weather has not been in our favor over the past week in general, but we are still marching forward with our progress,\u201d said Daniel Berlant, spokesman for the California department of forestry and fire protection. One glimmer of hope is a forecast for rain by Thursday. \u201cAny sort of moisture is welcome at this point,\u201d said Scott Rowe, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. \u201cIn terms of fire, the weather outlook is looking to be improving.\u201d The struggle ahead Residents had no warning when the fires swept into their neighborhoods. \u201cI was barely able to pull on my pants and grab my wallet,\u201d Pacheco recalled of his escape from his smoke-filled mobile home. \u201cThere were flames everywhere. We had to drive through them.\u201d Other survivors echoed Pacheco\u2019s tale of fleeing for their lives without receiving any warning from officials. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the dogs, I might have been barbecued,\u201d said Robin, a Santa Rosa resident who asked not to be identified by her full name because she was a survivor of domestic violence. Pacheco and his roommate found their way to a Walmart parking lot, where a woman offered him a room to stay in, but he had left behind his phone and the little book where he recorded his family members\u2019 phone numbers. After days of searching hospitals and parking lots, his nieces and nephews convinced a local television station to run a report on their missing uncle, leading to their reunification. On Sunday, Pacheco\u2019s family accompanied him to Sonoma County\u2019s newly organized emergency assistance center, which was set up Saturday as a one-stop shop for government aid. \u201cThe biggest challenge for us is the sheer number of people who need help,\u201d said the center\u2019s director, Michael Gossman, who is usually an administrator with the county water agency but took on a new role to help with the relief efforts. About 500 fire victims had been served by the center by midday Sunday. \u201cWe have people in there who are going to sit down with you and find out what you need,\u201d a county probation department employee, Tom Gerstel, told those still waiting in line. \u201cWe have a list of needs you might have that you haven\u2019t even thought of yet.\u201d Pacheco, who worked at a gas station parking lot in Santa Rosa for 17 years before retiring in 2015, doesn\u2019t want to tell his family members exactly how much money went up in flames. \u201cHe had little hide-out spots\u201d for his money, said his niece Adriana Rios, 21. \u201cHe was just old-school and didn\u2019t ever deposit or think he had to.\u201d The family is fairly sure that he did not have renter\u2019s insurance to cover his belongings. The wildfires did not discriminate by class. In Santa Rosa, the region\u2019s largest city, flames devoured almost 3,000 buildings, from the upscale homes of Fountaingrove \u2013 a neighborhood where many of the city\u2019s wealthiest lived \u2013 to the humble mobile home park catering to retirees, and the middle-class subdivisions near Coffey Park. In all, about one in every 20 homes in the city were wiped out over the past week, a crisis that will only exacerbate an already tight rental market. The city\u2019s rents grew 50% over the past five years, the fastest growth in the country, according to a Bloomberg analysis of Zillow data. But recovery will probably be significantly more challenging for renters and low-income people, especially if they did not have insurance. Pacheco\u2019s family helped him apply for Section 8 housing vouchers and rental assistance, but Rios said that they had been informed it could take months for the applications to be processed. Relief workers also distributed a list of current apartment vacancies in Santa Rosa, but most were renting for $1,200 to $1,600 a month, well above the $700 rent Pacheco paid at the mobile home park. For the time being, Pacheco will stay with family members, Rios said, but none of them have a lot of extra cash on hand. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult,\u201d said Rios, a program assistant for a mental health agency. \u201cWe all have bills and we all have families. I think it\u2019s going to be a strain but we can pull it together.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
