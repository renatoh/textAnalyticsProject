Cleared the chief executive Mark Palios of any blame for the FA fiasco, just before an alleged plot between Palios and his director of communications Colin Gibson to undermine Eriksson was revealed. What did he say? 'I have received categorical assurances from Mark Palios that he did not mislead or attempt to mislead the FA or its officials. I am satisfied by the chief executive's reassurances.' What could happen? Could be removed from office at a meeting of the full FA council in October. David Davies - FA executive director What did he do? Quizzed Eriksson somewhat inconclusively on whether he was having an affair with Alam - then went on holiday. His role or not in the issuing of the FA denial remains a mystery. On returning, gave Eriksson a ringing vote of confidence. What did he say? 'Sven is one of the outstanding coaches in the world - that is why so many people want to hire him. He is popular and highly respected by the players.' What could happen? Who knows? Has been through similar scrapes without any indication that his job security has ever been threatened. Faria Alam - Personal assistant to David Davies What did she do? Conducted an affair with Mark Palios, who then dropped her, and took up with Eriksson. Sent emails to a friend detailing the relationships which later turned up in the News of the World. Went on holiday. Came back and signed up with Max Clifford. What did she say? According to a friend: 'She said that the sex was fantastic. She said Sven had a great body and had been a very generous lover and had performed a certain sex act in a very satisfying way.' What could happen? She handed in her notice yesterday. Colin Gibson - FA director of communications What did he do? Tried to cut a deal with the News of the World in which they would leave his boss Mark Palios out of the Alam stories if he gave them chapter and verse on the Eriksson affair. Was not surprisingly stitched up by the News of the World for his pains. What did he say? 'What I'm proposing is that I give you chapter and verse on her and Sven and get her to do an interview to say that she lied to everybody. And the pay-off is that we leave MP out of it.' What could happen? Tendered his resignation last Sunday. It was accepted at the board meeting yesterday. Sven-Goran Eriksson - England coach What did he do? Eriksson had an affair with Faria Alam, secretary to the FA executive officer David Davies. What did he say? When asked by Davies whether reports of the affair were true he reportedly said: \"This is nonsense\". Insists he did not agree to the FA's subsequent statement denying the affair. 'I wish to state unequivocally that . . . I have at no time either categorically confirmed or denied any relationship with Ms Faria Alam'. What could happen? Should England struggle in their opening World Cup qualifiers against Austria and Poland, he could be toast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
