The former Chelsea owner has been chairman of the Championship club since 2005 \u2013 barring a short period during the club's 2007 administration \u2013 during which time he served two separate consortiums of anonymous offshore owners. The obfuscated ownership structure finally came to an end last month, when Bates took over 73% of the club in a transaction whose cost has not been disclosed. But the lack of transparency remains a major concern of the ongoing parliamentary inquiry into football governance. Now Damian Collins, the Conservative MP who sits on the football governance inquiry, has set up an adjournment debate at Westminster Hall next Tuesday. \"The principle is that it should never be allowed to happen again that football clubs are bought by offshore trusts of which we have no idea who the owners are,\" said Collins. \"Even though Ken Bates has now taken the club over, I do not think we should forget that. There remain a lot of unanswered questions about the whole process which warrant a full investigation.\" When Leeds collapsed under the weight of \u00a335m in debt in 2007 its anonymous offshore creditors refused bids that would have earned them \u00a38m more, simply because they wanted Bates to retain control as chairman. That insolvency process also led to HM Revenue &amp; Customs receiving only a fraction of the \u00a37.7m it was owed in unpaid taxes. Collins added: \"I think we should investigate how Leeds was bought by Ken Bates and whether there are issues for the government to look into, given the millions of pounds of unpaid tax in the administration. We should also consider whether there is a need for the government to look into how the money was raised to buy the club, and where it came from.\" Delay for De Gea Manchester United's move for David de Gea might hit something of a snag that could feasibly delay his move to Old Trafford until after the start of next season. It is widely held that United will acquire the Spain Under-21 international goalkeeper on or around next Wednesday, when he is expected to switch agents. Currently the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid player is represented by You First Sport, but word is he will switch to Jorge Mendes, who is well known at Old Trafford after handling B\u00e9b\u00e9's transfer there from Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es. B\u00e9b\u00e9 yesterday joined Besiktas on a season-long loan. Mendes has not responded to messages asking for confirmation of these claims, and United would not comment because \"we haven't signed the player\". But one person who did speak is his current agent at You First Sport, Hector Rinc\u00f3n. When asked if he believed Mendes had been conducting transfer negotiations behind his back, Rinc\u00f3n responded by saying: \"I can say he's our client until 30 August.\" And if Rinc\u00f3n holds De Gea to his representation contract until that date, it is conceivable that United would not have access to Van der Sar's replacement until more than a fortnight after the season starts. Perhaps Mendes is merely acting as United's representatives in the discussions, and these things do tend to be settled out of court (Peter Harrison, who as Digger revealed in February had claimed Andy Carroll's move to Liverpool in January violated his representation contract, yesterday settled with the player and his new agent) but the silence of the parties involved only muddies the waters. Fifa risks clubs' wrath Fifa's plans to expand the international match calendar by five dates, first revealed in Wednesday's Guardian, will apparently \"consider\" the views of the clubs. What the clubs \u2013 football's employers \u2013 are finding difficult to swallow is the suspicion that any such \"consideration\" will be a mere afterthought. Fifa said a meeting of the confederations will take place in the autumn to discuss the proposal for a 17-match international season. By which time, fear sources on the elite clubs' organisation, the European Clubs Association, it will be a fait accompli. Clubs and the ECA cannot convey their views directly to Fifa but must do so through national associations or through Fifa's Committee for Club Football (a 21-member body that includes the world-famous Waitakere United, Jomo Cosmos, Kashima Antlers and Tigres) at a likely meeting in September. That will be only its third ever meeting since its inception in 2008. \"By the time the club committee meets the calendar will already have been drawn,\" said an ECA source. \"Fifa is involving the clubs through the federations and confederations but when it gets to the executive committee it is already decided.\" Trouble continues to brew. Website woozy Talking of brewers, the Football Association issued a press release on its website yesterday to announce Budweiser's three-year sponsorship of the FA Cup. Lots of readers sniggered that this same announcement was entitled \"The FA Cup sponsored by E.ON.\" But there really was no contradiction there, since E.ON's deal does not expire until 31 July this year. So all those suggestions that the FA's website editor had been helping himself to the complimentary crates of booze were scurrilous bunk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
