Who will replace Sanders? Another empowered woman no doubt. The kindest thing you can say about Sarah Sanders is that she was completely useless. She didn\u2019t bother disguising her disdain for reporters. She didn\u2019t bother holding press briefings \u2013 the last one was over 90 days ago. And she didn\u2019t bother with the truth. She was an incompetent press secretary. Here\u2019s the thing though: Sanders was never really hired to be a press secretary. Her real job, I\u2019d venture, was to be a Very Visible Woman. Her real job was to be the female face of a deeply misogynistic administration; to play the role of the empowered working mother and make the Trump administration\u2019s crass patriarchy more palatable. For a while Sanders was extremely effective at weaponizing her womanhood. When politically convenient, for example, she\u2019d bring up the fact that she was the first mother to have the role of press secretary. \u201cThat says less about me than it does about this president,\u201d Sanders told reporters in 2017. She then went on to disingenuously claim that \u201cempowering working moms is the heart of the president\u2019s agenda, particularly when it comes to things like tax reform\u201d. There\u2019s no better example of how effective Sanders was at using her sex as a shield than the speed with which a number of high-profile female journalists jumped to Sanders\u2019 defense when Michelle Wolf made a joke about the press secretary at the 2018 White House correspondents\u2019 dinner. \u201cWatching a wife and mother be humiliated on national television for her looks is deplorable,\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski tweeted at the time. (Wolf didn\u2019t make a joke about Sanders\u2019 looks; this was a willful misinterpretation.) The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman similarly announced that it was admirable Sanders \u201csat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance, her job performance and so forth, instead of walking out, on national television\u201d. Sanders is far from the only woman to have played an important role in the Trump administration. While Trump may not have a feminist bone in his body, he\u2019s elevated a number of women into high-profile positions \u2013 a talking point frequently repeated by his acolytes. Women like Kellyanne Conway, Nikki Haley, Kirstjen Nielsen and (of course) Ivanka Trump, have been some of the most prominent faces of his administration. These footsoldiers of the patriarchy have helped to roll back women\u2019s rights and reinforce inequality while allowing the Trump administration to boast about \u201cempowering women\u201d. You could call it white(woman)washing. It\u2019s not clear who is going to replace Sanders yet. (And, let\u2019s face it, in many ways she is irreplaceable.) However, my bet is that Trump is strategically going to pick another woman. Indeed rumours are currently swirling that Stephanie Grisham, Melania\u2019s spokeswoman, is one of the leading candidates for the job. Whoever it is, good luck to them. Sanders has set a high bar for odiousness; hers will be a tough act to follow. My Little Lesbian Pony My Little Pony, a children\u2019s cartoon featuring little ponies, is marking Pride month with its first lesbian horse couple. They are called Aunt Holiday and Auntie Lofty, and they take care of a little pony called Scootaloo. Conservatives, predictably, are screaming \u201cnay\u201d and freaking out. The murky ethics of monetizing #MeToo Artist Andrea Bowers has got an installation at Art Basel, Open Secrets, that looks at all the sexual allegations that have come out during the #MeToo movement \u2013 it\u2019s priced at $300,000. The ethics of profiting from #MeToo are already questionable but there\u2019s more: Bowers used an abuse survivor\u2019s photo without their consent. After much justified outcry this week, the photo has now been removed. Say Her Name: Layleen Polanco Last Friday, Layleen Polanco, a 27-year-old transgender woman, was found dead in her cell at New York\u2019s Rikers Island jail. While her cause of death is currently being investigated, what we know so far is infuriating. Polanco had been locked up for two months on a misdemeanor charge because she couldn\u2019t afford $500 bail. She\u2019d also been placed in solitary confinement despite reportedly having a medical condition that gave her seizures. \u201cShe went [to Riker\u2019s Island] because of a fight,\u201d a friend of Polanco\u2019s told the New York Times. \u201cAnd her punishment was a death sentence.\u201d Photoshop your way to equality A bunch of Silicon Valley executives went to Italy to meet a designer who makes $1,000 sweatpants. While on their sweatpant sojourn, they took a group photo. A very normal thing to do! They then realized that a photo featuring 15 dudes was maybe not the best optics and photoshopped two women into it, before the picture was published in GQ. A very normal thing to do! Women\u2019s World Cup news roundup The Guardian\u2019s got a good piece on how Argentina\u2019s team, which was so underfunded it didn\u2019t play in 2015 or 2017, took on sexism to reach this year\u2019s World Cup. Meanwhile, Trump refused to say whether he thought the US women\u2019s team deserves equal pay. Megan Rapinoe won\u2019t sing the national anthem (good for her). And Marina Hyde has a fun piece on \u201cthe great under-reported story of this Women\u2019s World Cup: men\u201d. Keanu Reeves\u2019s hands-off approach The internet is obsessed with Reeves: the guy is everywhere at the moment. His hands, however, are not. Reeves, who has been dubbed a \u201crespectful king\u201d has mastered the art of the \u2018hover hand\u2019 when taking photos with women.
