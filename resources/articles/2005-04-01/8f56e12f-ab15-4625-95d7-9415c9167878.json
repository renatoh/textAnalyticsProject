I have a dollar bank account with Royal Bank of Scotland, with a Mastercard in dollars which I have used for years. Try as I might I cannot find a bank that will provide me with a euro account and credit card. Of course this means that if I pay for a hotel or meal while working in Europe I have use my UK Visa sterling card, so every transaction suffers a double exchange rate charge. The several banks that I have approached seem surprised that anyone might want this. \"We don't have a product yet\" was one reaction. Someone else suggested that it was against Treasury rules. DW A There are a host of companies, including several well known UK banks and building societies, that offer offshore euro accounts. Several of these include the availability of a (Visa) debit card. Would it not make sense for you to put your euro earnings into one of these accounts, (which in some cases also include a cheque book facility)? That would save you many of problems on changing money into different currencies. Details of the offshore euro accounts are listed by Moneyfacts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
