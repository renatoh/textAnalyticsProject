A reasonably exciting deadline day, something that can\u2019t always be claimed. Fans of Arsenal, Manchester United, Everton, Leeds and Southampton, among others, have plenty to be excited about. Thanks for reading! Manchester United have confirmed a fourth deadline-day deal late on: the signing of Uruguayan teenage winger Facundo Pellistri. He\u2019ll cost \u00a310m from Penarol. Some welcoming words for Thomas Partey. \u201cWe have been watching Thomas for a while, so we\u2019re now delighted to add such a high quality player to our squad,\u201d says Mikel Arteta. \u201cHe is a dynamic midfielder with great energy. He brings a lot of experience from a top club that has competed at the highest level in La Liga and the Champions League for several years. We\u2019re very impressed with his attitude and his approach to the game. He\u2019s an intelligent footballer and we\u2019re looking forward to him integrating into our system and contributing to the progress we\u2019re building at the moment at the club.\u201d Confirmation from Jacob Steinberg that Fikayo Tomori rejected the chance to join West Ham on loan from Chelsea. But he adds, tantalisingly: \u201cFulham have had more luck with a Chelsea academy graduate - we\u2019re just waiting for confirmation.\u201d Joe Rodon to Spurs won\u2019t happen tonight. But the Swansea defender could still make the move to north London; the clubs have until October 16 to complete a deal, thanks to the window extension agreed between the Premier League and Football League. We knew it was coming, but it\u2019s now been made official. Thomas Partey is an Arsenal player. West Ham\u2019s loan deal for Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori has fallen through, according to Sky Sports. Fees had been agreed and paperwork filled in, but just before the 11pm deadline, Tomori got cold feet and decided against the move. He stays at Stamford Bridge. Chris Smalling bids farewell to Manchester United, writing on Twitter: \u201cAn incredible club, that I am proud to have been a part of. 10 years ago I could have only dreamt of everything we have achieved. I wish you all my very best, whilst I am saddened to leave I know you will continue to achieve great things!\u201d Everton have completed the signing of goalkeeper Robin Olsen on a season-long loan from Roma. The Sweden international, 30, becomes the club\u2019s sixth signing of the transfer window. Everton had looked into signing Sergio Romero from Manchester United and Paulo Gazzaniga from Spurs but neither wanted to do a loan deal. Lucas Torreira meanwhile moves the other way. He joins Atletico on loan, a move just confirmed by the Gunners. Well, that didn\u2019t take long. Here comes a potential game-changer. And so the window closes. A few deals yet to be announced, though. Barcelona have not met Manchester City\u2019s \u00a320m valuation for Eric Garcia, according to Sky Sports. He\u2019ll be staying put at the Etihad, on the bench, for the next couple of months at least. A few words from Joachim Andersen, who has joined Fulham on a season-long loan from Lyon. The 24-year-old, capped once by Denmark, says: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to playing in the Premier League and playing for a nice club like Fulham. It\u2019s a league I\u2019ve been following since I was a child and it\u2019s a big, big dream to play in the Premier League, so I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d Arsenal fans can relax \u2013 Thomas Partey will be signing and it\u2019s just a waiting game now, with completion of the deal well on track for 11pm. As for a formal announcement, we\u2019ll have to hope that comes soon after. All today\u2019s dealings (\u00a345m payment and medical) have taken place in Madrid. Things have moved surprisingly quickly, by any standards, after a summer-long stand-off and he\u2019ll be coming to the Emirates after the international break. A few words from Theo Walcott on his return to Saints. \u201cI had a few opportunities from other clubs, but as soon as Southampton came in for me, it\u2019s part of me and has made me into the player I am. It\u2019s in my heart. I will probably cry, I bet, when I first play, and it means so much. All the people that made it happen, I can\u2019t thank them enough. Honestly, I\u2019m so pleased. I was seriously lost for words when Southampton came on the table, and for me it was such an easy decision.\u201d The fee for Raphinha is undisclosed, though reports suggest the Brazilian winger cost Leeds \u00a317m. The 23-year-old, who helped Rennes make the Champions League last season, has agreed a four-year deal. The done deals keep on coming. Here\u2019s some exciting, if not totally unexpected, news for Leeds United supporters ... Fulham\u2019s loan signing of Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been confirmed. Also ... Theo Walcott\u2019s career has come full circle with the Everton winger rejoining Southampton 14 years after leaving his boyhood club. The 31-year-old was in the final year of his Everton contract and his only start for Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s in-form team this season was the Carabao Cup second-round win against Salford. Having completed the signing of Ben Godfrey from Norwich on deadline day, and moved for a new goalkeeper to compete with Jordan Pickford, Everton accepted Southampton\u2019s offer of a loan deal with wages split between the two clubs. Walcott earns a basic \u00a3110,000-a-week at Everton and also cost a \u00a320m fee when signing for Sam Allardyce from Arsenal in January 2018. The winger, who has had an underwhelming spell at Goodison Park, left Southampton in January 2006, having risen through the club\u2019s academy to make his first team debut at 16. Sevilla have made a couple of signings today. Defender Karim Rekik comes in from Hertha Berlin, while winger Oussama Idrissi joins from AZ Alkmaar. Here\u2019s Sid Lowe on Julen Lopetegui\u2019s big rebuild. Rangers have completed the signing of South Africa international Bongani Zungu. He joins on loan from Amiens until the end of the season. Zungu is a long-time Liverpool fan and is looking forward to working with his hero Steven Gerrard. \u201cI have studied the squad and feel I can come in and bring my attributes to help the team improve,\u201d he says. \u201cThe chance to play for such a big club especially in European competitions is very exciting for me. I can\u2019t wait to fly to Scotland and meet my new team mates. I know that I will settle in Glasgow and am looking forward to getting started as soon as possible. I really want the fans to be proud of my performances and will always give 100 per cent for my new team. Rangers is a global club and I know there are already many supporters across Africa. I am looking forward to playing in front of a big crowd and audiences across the world.\u201d More good news for Fulham! First a medical for Ruben Loftus-Cheek, now this from Jacob Steinberg: \u201cFulham are closing in on the signing of Lyon centre-back Joachim Andersen.\u201d The love is reciprocated, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer saying: \u201cEdinson is an experienced ultimate professional who always gives everything for his team. His goalscoring record for club and country is fantastic and we are delighted to sign a player of his calibre. He\u2019ll bring energy, power, leadership and a great mentality to the squad but, most importantly, he\u2019ll bring goals. He has had a brilliant career so far, winning trophies at almost every club he has played for, and he still has so much more to give at the highest level. The opportunity for our young players to learn from one of Europe\u2019s top goalscorers over the last 10 years is fantastic and it will really benefit them going forward. Edinson knows exactly what it takes to succeed and we are all looking forward to seeing him make an impact at Manchester United.\u201d Here\u2019s what Cavani has had to say upon arrival at Old Trafford. \u201cManchester United is one of the greatest clubs in the world, so it is a real honour to be here. I\u2019ve worked really hard during the time off and I feel eager to compete and represent this incredible club. I have played in front of some of the most passionate supporters in football during my career and I know that it will be the same in Manchester. I cannot wait to experience the Old Trafford atmosphere, when it is safe for the fans to return. I look forward to continuing to write my little story inside the book of football and I know that\u2019s why my focus has to remain the same as always - work, work, work. I have had a conversation with the manager and this has increased my desire to wear this beautiful shirt.\u201d BREAKING NEWS AT TEN. Edinson Cavani to Manchester United is a done deal. Manchester City and Barcelona might reach agreement on Eric Garcia, though. The young defender wants to return to Spain, Barca want him, and City are happy to sell. It only requires agreement on valuation: Barca have bid \u00a315m but City want \u00a35m more. It doesn\u2019t look as though Liverpool are going to offload any of Xherdan Shaqiri, Marko Grujic and Harry Wilson. All were reportedly available for sale, but Liverpool weren\u2019t considering loan deals, and no acceptable bids were made. A drama-free day at Anfield. Celtic have formally completed the loan signing of AC Milan and Uruguay left-back Diego Laxalt. The 27-year-old has passed his medical and paperwork was filed less than three hours before Scotland\u2019s midnight transfer deadline. Meanwhile Celtic have sold 20-year-old forward Jack Aitchison to Barnsley. Aitchison is Celtic\u2019s youngest-ever goalscorer, having scored against Motherwell at the age of 16. As we await more breaking transfer news ... why not take a little time to reflect upon the astonishing implosions of the weekend? The 18-year-old Atalanta winger Amad Diallo will join Manchester United in January. It\u2019s all subject to a medical, personal terms and work permit, but agreement has been made between the clubs and announced by United. The cost: \u00a319m with \u00a318m in add-ons. Still no word on Edinson Cavani. Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek is having his medical at Fulham now. All being good, he\u2019ll join on loan for the rest of the season. Theo Walcott has successfully completed his medical at Southampton, according to Sky Sports. It\u2019s now a scramble to get the paperwork completed in time. Manchester United have officially confirmed Chris Smalling\u2019s transfer to Roma. A statement on their website said: \u201cManchester United have reached an agreement with AS Roma for the transfer of defender Chris Smalling. Well liked and trusted by every United manager he played under, the only current first-team player to have made more appearances for the club than Chris is, at the time of writing, David De Gea. Everyone at Manchester United would like to thank Chris for his years of service, dedication and professionalism, and wish him all the best for his future.\u201d For your aural pleasure. Scott Parker and Fulham are struggling to catch a break this season. Here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg with the latest bad news for the beleaguered Cottagers: \u201cIt\u2019s being reported in Holland that Timo Baumgartl\u2019s move to Fulham is off. They still haven\u2019t brought in a centre-back.\u201d Former Middlesbrough, Aston Villa, Nottingham Forest and Cardiff winger Albert Adomah has signed a two-year deal with QPR - the club he followed as a youngster. \u201cImagine being a supporter and playing for the club you love,\u201d the 32-year-old, who was a free agent following the expiry of his deal at Forest, says. \u201cWords can\u2019t even describe it. It\u2019s just amazing, just a pleasure to be here. This is just surreal. All I can see right now is Bobby Zamora scoring at Wembley - I should be here talking about myself, but that\u2019s all I can think of right now. If I could get a third promotion, that would be one of my great achievements. That\u2019s my ambition.\u201d Wesley Hoedt has left Southampton for Lazio. The Dutch defender rejoins his old club on a season-long loan. Also on his way from St Mary\u2019s: club-record \u00a319m striker Guido Carrillo, who has joined Elche after Saints terminated his contract. The 29-year-old only managed 10 appearances in his time on the south coast. No more word yet on the possible return of Theo Walcott, though. Two hours to get that one over the line. Bayern Munich midfielder Michael Cuisance, who reportedly failed a medical with Leeds United, has moved to Marseille instead. He joins on a year-long loan. In other hot Ligue 1 news, Lyon have borrowed Juventus full-back Mattia De Sciglio for the season. Jack Wilshere, formerly of West Ham United, has taken to social media to offer his take on events. He doesn\u2019t seem particularly happy, all told. \u201cI have been fully fit for a large period of time at the club, including over the course of the last eight months, training hard every day, but unfortunately have not been given the opportunity to play ... I\u2019m still only 28 and feel fit, strong and ready to play.\u201d Chris Smalling\u2019s transfer to Roma is complete. \u201cThe paperwork to the Italian FA was lodged with a minute to spare,\u201d reports Jamie Jackson. \u201cThe price is 15 million euros plus add-ons.\u201d The latest drama of an extremely busy day at Old Trafford. A bit more on Jack Wilshere\u2019s demise at West Ham ... in actual story form. Jacob Steinberg has the details. Federico Chiesa has made the move from Fiorentina to Juventus. The 22-year-old winger joins the Old Lady on a two-season loan deal worth 10 million euros, with an obligation to buy for a further 40 million. Chiesa is the son of former Fiorentina striker Enrico Chiesa, who was in the team which won the club\u2019s last major trophy, the 2001 Coppa Italia. He\u2019s scored 34 goals in 153 appearances for La Viola. A gentle reminder that when Roberto Baggio made this move in 1990, there were riots on the streets of Florence. Chris Smalling to Roma is not a done deal yet. \u201cManchester United are waiting on confirmation that Roma lodged papers in time with the Italian FA for Chris Smalling\u2019s transfer to go through,\u201d reports Jamie Jackson. No word on Edinson Cavani yet, either, though as he\u2019s a free agent the club have until tomorrow to sign him in time to register him for Europe. Rangers are hoping to bolster their midfield with 27-year-old South Africa international Bongani Zungu. Reports claim they\u2019re close to agreeing a fee with his current club Amiens of France. Meanwhile an unidentified Serie A club has made an unsuccessful loan bid for Alfredo Morelos, who is now expected to stay at Ibrox. First Jack Wilshere, now another great unfulfilled talent bids farewell. Gerard Deulofeu has left Watford, joining Udinese on loan. Meanwhile another winger, Leicester City\u2019s Rachid Ghezzal, is off to Besiktas. If you\u2019re in the market for a comprehensive audit of this summer\u2019s transfer action, you could do worse than click below. Click below! \u201cRe: Arsenal\u2019s new signing. I\u2019m hearing that he\u2019s been given shirt number three because his associates claim that Partey fears two.\u201d New-wave satirist Gary Naylor, ladies and gentlemen, giving us any old excuse to spin one of the classics. West Ham, who are targeting a loan move for Chelsea\u2019s Fikayo Tomori, have cancelled Jack Wilshere\u2019s contract by mutual consent. The former Arsenal midfielder has made little impact since moving to the London Stadium on a three-year deal worth \u00a3100,000 a week in 2018. What a sad tale. We\u2019ll always have the memory of Wilshere against Barca in 2011... Here\u2019s Arsenal fan Glenn Stainsby, only partially toeing the Partey line. (This guy is a sub-editor\u2019s dream.) \u201cI think Partey is an improvement on what we\u2019ve got in that area but still believe that missing out on Aouar might come back to bite us. We used to be over-reliant on diminutive creative players - Arshavin/Nasri/Rosicky/Cesc/Wilshere/Santi to name but a few - but now I worry we lack someone who can unpick the lock when teams sit back against us. Bring back a little genius!\u201d Glad you brought up Jack Wilshere, because ... Newcastle United have signed 21-year-old Peruvian Rodrigo Vilca from Deportivo Municipal. He\u2019s scored two goals in ten Peruvian Primera Division appearances this season, and can play as an attacking midfielder, a number ten, or as a winger on either flank. \u201cIt seems a very nice city and the hotel has a very nice view,\u201d says the Nobby Solano de nos jours. Here\u2019s a word from our man in Manchester, and it\u2019s disappointing news for United fans desirous of welcoming Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 to Old Trafford. \u201cThe latest is that this proposed loan move to Man United is OFF, is the understanding,\u201d reports Jamie Jackson. Will that force them to meet Watford\u2019s demand for \u00a350m for Isma\u00efla Sarr? They would, of course, have 11 more days to work that one out, thanks to the aforementioned second domestic window. Arsenal have met Thomas Partey\u2019s \u00a345m release clause and now the race is on to get everything done. It\u2019s a complicated business: in instances like this, the buying club deposits the release fee with La Liga, who then check the money has cleared and inform both player and club. Partey is believed to have completed his medical in Madrid, personal terms are all sorted \u2013 as per my earlier news story \u2013 and now he hopes to tie up the loose ends in London tonight. As long as the money clears in time, there should be no problems ... but expect to be hanging on for a few hours yet. Joe Rodon to Spurs has a decent chance of happening, according to somebody close to the deal. It would not be a loan, rather a permanent deal and, if Spurs could get the Swansea centre-half, it would complete a near perfect window for Jose Mourinho. Hello everyone. Here we all are, then. Four hours until it\u2019s all over. Sort of. A reminder that the window closes at 11pm BST in England, Spain and France. Scotland have an extra hour; Germany\u2019s window has already shut. But Premier League clubs can continue to trade with Football League clubs (though not each other) until October 16, when a second domestic window closes, and some administrative venetian blinds are snapped shut. Someone will then put a log on the fire, with the nights fair drawing in. Right then ravers, my watch is ended. Here\u2019s Scott Murray to coax you through the staggering denouement. West Ham: Porto are closing in on a loan move for West Ham\u2019s Felipe Anderson, who has massively gone off the boil after a bright first season in England. \u201cOutstanding Back to the Future reference an hour ago,\u201d says Espen Bommen. \u201cJust wanted to let you know at least one person got it.....\u201d My assumption is that everyone did. And while we\u2019re here... \u201cSo much for Lampard\u2019s homegrown revolution,\u201d says Robert Lin. \u201cHe got so much praise for that last season and now goes and spends \u00a3200m on foreign players all the while loaning out his English players.\u201d I don\u2019t know \u2013 if his English players aren\u2019t good enough, then what can he do? Mason Mount might get there and Tammy Abraham will always be a good option, but if there are better players around, why shouldn\u2019t he buy them? How many properly good centre-backs are there in the entirety of the Premeer League? The current standard is remarkably low. Chelsea/West Ham: Meanwhile West Ham are interested in Fikayo Tomori on loan. Chelsea really need to shift a centre-back now that Rudiger is staying. Chelsea/Fulham: I am told that Ruben Loftus-Cheek to Fulham on loan could well happen now. The Chelsea midfielder needs games. That\u2019s a good deal for everyone apart from Man United. \u201cWhat I\u2019ll always also remember about that goal,\u201d writes David Sweet, \u201cwas Pulis, in the post-match interview, furious that one of his players had not taken Boufal out \u2013 and saying so in pretty much so many words. Pulis, gone, but not forgotten - or missed.\u201d That is not ununderstandable. Sky are reporting that Wolves are going to chat a new contract through with Adama Traore. I\u2019m surprised no one tried to have him off them, but maybe I\u2019m saying that because I love watching him play. Barnsley have signed Jack Aitchison from Celtic. \u201cWould you have Smalling back in the United team at the moment seeing as no new centre-back appears likely?\u201d asks Jim Caudwell. \u201cApparently he\u2019s been training separately from the squad and I reckon West Ham could do worse than make a move for him.\u201d In a second. He\u2019s quick, strong, good in a rearguard and knows what it takes to win. He\u2019s miles better than Lindel\u00f6f and probably better than Maguire too. \u201cThat Boufal goal is possibly my favourite-ever goal,\u201d emails Ben Lake, and it seems to be lost to the mists of time. I would personally rate it far above Son\u2019s goal last year, as Boufal isn\u2019t just outpacing players, he takes it past everyone on his way to goal. Not that Son\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t also fantastic. Also, two WBA players run into each other so distracted are they by the flowing skill unfolding and once Boufal scores he runs straight over to rub it into his own manager\u2019s face (Mark Hughes) for leaving him out of the side for so long. That bit is mysteriously cut out of that Southhampton promo reel. Dunno why. It has drama, comedy and a genuine wow factor. Love it.\u201d Agree with every word of that \u2013 it was by far the best goal scored that season as far as I saw it, though I\u2019ll always go for runs and moves ahead of belts. \u201cAs a Swansea and Wales fan,\u201d says Craig Foley, \u201cI\u2019m torn about Rodon going to Spurs. He\u2019s certainly good enough so it\u2019s a great move for him and for Wales, and it\u2019s a good fee for the club (though I would have liked a bit more than the reported \u00a318m). It leaves us short of a centre-back though. Cooper was looking to bring an extra one in, not lose one.\u201d I guess if they get the deal done quickly, they\u2019ve got more time to spend the money. Man United: \u201cUtd been tracking Telles since he was at Galatasaray in 2014, is understanding; scouted comprehensively by scouts in Portugal and club\u2019s chief scout.\u201d \u201cAston Villa have had a widely accepted great window,\u201d says Matt Collins. \u201cBut do you think any of last season\u2019s top four or even top eight have? The general feeling at most clubs is that they\u2019ve done too much business (Chelsea) or not enough (everyone else). Or is that just general pandemic related dissatisfaction on fans\u2019 parts?\u201d I feel like an idiot saying this, but I can\u2019t say who\u2019s had a good window until I\u2019ve seen the players play. I think Chelsea have bought three really nifty ones, but they\u2019ve not addressed their principal weaknesses \u2013 the question there is whether Frank Lampard does well enough to get another go at sorting his defence. Mr Tickle must\u2019ve been unavailable. Everton: Everton have now turned to Roma\u2019s Robin Olsen as potential competition/replacement for Jordan Pickford with Manchester United and Tottenham reluctant to sanction loans for Sergio Romero and Paulo Gazzaniga respectively. United were in a one-horse race for Telles and still find themselves completing the deal on the final day of the window, having conceded six goals at the weekend, two the one before that and three the one before that. It\u2019s almost as though the board don\u2019t really care about football. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r speaks: \u201cFirst and foremost I welcome Alex to United. He is a player we have been tracking for some time and his performances over the past few years are exactly what we are looking for. He is a fighter and a winner and will add real determination and competition to the squad. Alex has the qualities, both as a player and as a person, that we want here at Manchester United.\u201d Telles speaks: \u201cTo join a club with the prestige of Manchester United is a huge honour,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to work hard to get to this moment in your career and now I am coming to this club, I can promise that I will give everything in my heart to be a success here. I won many trophies at FC Porto and I want to continue that at United. The manager has a clear plan and direction for this team and I can\u2019t wait to pull on the famous shirt.\u201d Sometimes the lines write themselves. \u201cDo United have the same concerns about Smalling now that they had when they moved him down the pecking order before shipping him off to Roma?\u201d asks Michael Jake Shaffer. \u201cCan\u2019t understand why he hasn\u2019t been recalled given the shambolic defensive displays. Admittedly, United need some defensive strengthening, but is the focus on that issue just a cover for the true, and much larger problem: an incoherent mess of a midfield?\u201d The midfield needs a player, I agree \u2013 an upgrade on Matic. That would\u2019ve been my first priority, followed by a centre-back. But given the events of yesterday, I\u2019m wondering if we\u2019ll see something different after the break \u2013 Van de Beek in for Pogba and McTominay in for Matic. He\u2019s already been named their man of the match for yesterday. \u201cAncelotti is well-known as one of the nicest men out there,\u201d says Admir Pajic, \u201cand his trophy-room is nicely laden, but there have been quite a few examples of him failing to keep up his early good form. Hence so many tight title races lost with Juventus (twice), Milan (once) and Real (twice). Now, at Everton, he might have an advantage of not playing in Europe but the schedule will be hectic enough so that fatigue can kick in. Also, he knows how to make the best of talent he has at his disposal. James has been tremendous since his arrival.\u201d Yep, and Richarlison struck me quite some time ago as someone with the raw materials to do a lot in the game. Gene Salorio returns on players\u2019 wages: \u201cAgree with your points but I\u2019m thinking of the 275K in relation to (1) other Arsenal players, and (2) a club that just dropped Gunnersaurus for financial reasons.\u201d I agree, but players\u2019 wages aren\u2019t to blame for this, immoral owners are. We can\u2019t let them misdirect us. The right centre-back would make a big difference to them. Southampton are talking to Angers about loaning them Sofiane Boufal. \u201cSeeing that Theo Walcott may/might/is going back to Southampton,\u201d says Russell Richardson, \u201cI wondered if there couldn\u2019t be a Bethlehem Clause that summarily returns all players (over 30?) to their clubs of origin? Southampton would look quite a tasty proposition, as would Anderlecht and Sporting Lisbon. I seem to remember that Speedway did something similar way back, by randomly placing stars among the top flight teams. If anyone knows how that worked, I\u2019d love to hear it. Madness!\u201d Strong Jon Stark, matchwinner for hire, vibes. \u201cI\u2019m from the US,\u201d confesses Doug Moire, \u201cand even I know Ancelotti at Milan built perhaps the most consistently excellent club in the world in the aughties. I assume a Buddy Holly man would have that understanding...\u201d One league title in that time. Two Champions Leagues too (though I\u2019ll never get over 06-07 \u2013 injuries to Ferdinand and Vidic got them through the semi, though saved the world Liverpool v Man United in Athens). He plays at left-back or in attacking midfield. His contract has been cancelled. Shrewsbury have signed Jan Zamburek from Brentford on a season-long loan. Sky reckon Antonio R\u00fcdiger is staying at Chelsea. I guess Barcelona and Real Madrid aren\u2019t ready for him yet (but their kids are gonna love him). But the streets will never forget his performance at Watford away, one of the all-time great mares. Any more for any more? Chelsea: Tiemou\u00e9 Bakayoko joins Napoli on loan from Chelsea, confirmed and official. Consider it done! \u201cMoney,\u201d says Richard Hirst. \u201cIt could go to reducing the cost for the supporters.\u201d It could and it should \u2013 with the money the Glazers are taking out of Man United, for example, they could let every supporter in free to every game \u2013 but it\u2019s never going to. I\u2019m also extremely reticent to gripe about the money made by largely working-class types who are brilliantly talented. I can think of far better receptacles for my ire. He\u2019s only realised a quarter of his potential so far. \u201cThe \u20ac50 million fee for Partey seems reasonable,\u201d reckons Gene Salorio, \u201cbut the reported \u20ac275,000 a week wages is beyond excessive.\u201d I don\u2019t know. The players are the attraction, the best in the world at what they do who sacrifice their youth for a short career. Do we baulk at what actors get? Ultimately, there\u2019s a lot of money in football and if it doesn\u2019t go to players, it\u2019ll go to owners. I know what I prefer. Have a shmy. Man United: Alex Telles contract is the standard for Manchester United of four years plus one year option: medical passed/deal almost completed, is the understanding... Sky reckon Sead Kolasnic\u2019s putative move to Bayer Leverkusen is off. But who\u2019s gonna tell him? \u201cEverton fan here,\u201d says Matt Burtz. \u201cOnce upon a time Everton did actually win league titles (nine of them, to be exact, including two out of three in the mid-80s). I think we can all agree that they have a manager who knows how to win. And if Leicester City could do it five seasons ago, well...\u201d Yes, I remember the 80s \u2013 I\u2019m not going to lie, I wasn\u2019t convinced by the Ancelotti appointment because his success is mainly with other people\u2019s teams, turning up and making everyone feel nice. Everton seemed to need more than that, but not for the first time, I was talking nonsense. \u201cThanks for the link to the Buddy Holly clip,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cIn one of the photos he bears an unmistakable resemblance to Sergio Busquets. Unsettling.\u201d I shall investigate. Busquets should definitely wear glasses though. Ben Godfrey to Everton is an interesting move. I\u2019m beginning to wonder whether if, given the craziness we\u2019re seeing at the moment, we\u2019ll see a surprise title challenge, and if it weren\u2019t for the inescapable reality of them being Everton, Everton would be the pick for that. The Athletic report that Spurs are weighing up a move for Joe Rodon, Swansea\u2019s Welsh centre-back. They\u2019ve got till 16 October to make up their collective mind. \u201cBayern have lost Perisic (back to Inter), Coutinho (back to Barcelona) and Thiago (sold to Liverpool)\u201c returns Amir Pajic, \u201cso their squad is quite short at the moment. Costa is a fleet-footed winger and I guess they wanted someone who would take no time to adapt. Also, they need someone to score two from the bench in an 8-3 drubbing of Man United at Old Trafford in Ro16.\u201d Costa\u2019s career path \u2013 Shakhtar, Bayern, Juventus loan, Juventus, Bayern \u2013 is not easy to understand. Do you like him, or don\u2019t you? Breaking: it\u2019s raining at Spurs\u2019 training ground. And also in my heart. He\u2019s having a medical as we speak. \u201cIs the answer zero?\u201d wonders Jim Caudwell in response to the poser below. Why have Bayern re-signed Douglas Costa? What am I missing? \u201cI\u2019m being pedantic but as a former resident of the Isle of Dogs I wanted to point out that Millwall FC are now based in South Bermondsey,\u201d says Ben Blatch-Hanlon, \u201cdespite being named after the Millwall dock area where they were first based!\u201d Love it, thanks \u2013 with the caveat that it\u2019s all south to me. Liverpool: Marko Grujic will not be joining Werder Bremen today. The midfielder was keen on a return to the Bundesliga and held talks with Bremen coach Florian Kohfeldt but the club\u2019s board would not sanction a permanent transfer. Grujic to stay with Liverpool for now and most likely move in January. It\u2019s on a season-long loan, with the option of a \u00a322.5m permanent move. If seems that Maxim Choupo-Moting is leaving PSG for Bayern Munich, exactly the career trajectory predicted by all who saw him play at Stoke. Isaac Olaofe of Millwall has had his season-long loan terminated by St Johnstone, so is returning to the Isle of Dogs. Quiz time: how many players have Chelsea and Man United sold between them? Updates contained herein. Sky says Isma\u00efla Sarr isn\u2019t going to Man United. Surely someone will have him away, he\u2019s not a Championship player. Man United: Hello from a rain-lashed HQ somewhere near Old Trafford where the understanding is a move involving Sergio Romero to Everton from Manchester United is characterised as \u201cunlikely\u201d. I wonder if that\u2019s United\u2019s doing. If it isn\u2019t, it should be. Man United: \u201cI\u2019m hearing that Chris Smalling\u2019s potential move from Manchester United to Roma might not happen. Roma were expected to sign the United centre-back, who was on loan there last season, but could now target a reunion with Chelsea\u2019s Antonio Rudiger.\u201d \u201cHaving watched quite a bit of Alex Telles over the last few years,\u201d says Alan Gomes, \u201cI completely agree with your description here: \u2018Telles is more of an attacker who I\u2019m not sure has the pace necessary to be self-sufficient.\u2019 \u201cIndeed! Telles is a fine player, but he usually relies on Porto\u2019s centre-backs to close the wing as he pushes forward. Porto\u2019s system catered to his strengths, with the excellent anchor midfielder Danilo Pereira (leaving for PSG) often covering for him too. Telles distinguished himself at Porto mostly as an excellent set-piece taker - something United, having Bruno Fernandes, don\u2019t really need?\u2019 Yes, if there\u2019s one area in which United are tickety-booooooooooo! it\u2019s penalty-takers. Quick, mobile, intelligent centre-backs, on the other hand.... \u201cFor years we had been told that Arsenal lack physical presence in the midfield,\u201d says Admir Pajic. \u201cNow that we are about to sign a Champions League-quality player who would give us space to play with a back four \u2013 meaning we can put one more creative player on the pitch \u2013 some people are complaining that he is not a De Bruyne. At the age of 27, he\u2019s entering his best years and the Arsenal midfield with Partey will be much, much better than it is right now.\u201d I agree with you \u2013 what I\u2019ve seen of Partey, he\u2019ll make a big difference to Arsenal. But they also lack goals and imagination in midfield, so he won\u2019t resolve everything. Walcott is southward bound for a medical, apparently, and he\u2019ll be loaned with Everton and Southampton sharing his wages. Southampton have also asked about Brandon Williams, but he\u2019s saying at Man United. \u201cIn response to the earlier post about Theo Walcott really being 31,\u201d says Dale Haslam from Aberdeen. \u201cWhen lockdown working from home started, I spent my lunch breaks rewatching Peep Show (wondering whether this whole covid-19 thing would blow over before I had chance to finish all nine series - how naive I was back in March!) Anyway, I reached the \u2018Three-o Walcott\u2019 episode and it made me think \u2018God, how long is it since this was filmed? How old must Walcott be now?\u2019 Then I remembered the national controversy around Sven ignoring other strikers in favour of including Walcott in the England World Cup squad in 2006 AGED 17 the nation gasped and did the maths myself to work out his current age \u2013 31. Peep Show literally has a quote for everything (even several about where I live). Leeds and Newcastle: Leeds are inching ever closer to completing the \u00a317m signing of Raphinha, the 23-year-old left-footed Brazilian winger who is one his way from Rennes for an initial \u00a317, possibly rising to \u00a324m. After arriving in Yorkshire on a flight from France last night a player comfortable on both flanks has been undergoing a medical this afternoon. Meanwhile Newcastle look essentially done and dusted with Rodrigo Vilca, a 21-year-old Peruvian playmaker completing the formalities surrounding his move form Lima\u2019s Deportivo Municipal. Vilca, though, will spend this season with Newcastle\u2019s under-23 squad as he is regarded as very much one for the future. Although Steve Bruce hopes to offload some fringe players, most notably Christian Atsu, he knows he may have to be patient and wait until the end of the EFL window before moving them on to Championship clubs. Alex Telles is having a medical at Man United, say Sky \u2013 another move that is both sensible and strange. On the one hand, United need a better left-back than Luke Shaw, but on the other, the way they play means that their back four need to be secure when left to defend one-on-one and Telles is more of an attacker who I\u2019m not sure has the pace necessary to be self-sufficient. Anyone who\u2019s seen more of him than I have, feel free to email in a correction. Theo Walcott back to Southampton is an interesting idea. He\u2019s a much better finisher than he\u2019s been given credit for, and Ralph Hasenhuttl is no fool. I\u2019d really look forward to seeing how that relationship worked out. Also going on. Can\u2019t believe they\u2019ve not paused this for this. This is an interesting note on Partey. My eyes tell me he\u2019s a very good player, but at 27 he\u2019d need to come in and be very good immediately. And, tangentially, is Bukayo Saka going to fill the creative midfield role now? What a player he is. \u201cRe Man Utd needing a right winger,\u201d says Jamie Lewis, \u201ccan Greenwood and Daniel James not both play there? Or even shift Martial or Rashford over there if Cavani is going to play centrally? Seems mad to me they\u2019re gonna blow more money on another wide attacker (of which they have several good ones) and not invest in a defensive midfielder (of which they have a couple of mediocre ones who shouldn\u2019t really be playing for a club in the champions league). Like Oliver, I too am awaiting David Sullivan\u2019s excuse for selling West Ham\u2019s most promising young player and not bringing in the centre-back that this sale was meant to facilitate.\u201d James likes to play on the left, and his confidence looks shot. I\u2019m surprised United haven\u2019t let him go on loan to Leeds, because he needs a change of scene and I daresay a bit of Bielsa wouldn\u2019t do any harm either. Perhaps United said no, as they\u2019re supposed to have done, because Leeds aren\u2019t short of wingers, I\u2019m not sure. As for Greenwood, he\u2019s an option off the right, but given Wan-Bissaka\u2019s reticence to go on the outside, they could really use a winger not always looking to come inside and get a shot off. On Sarr, Ed tells me that he\u2019s \u201cstill raw but will be a star with the right development\u201d. More below... He\u2019s on a roll! I\u2019m also looking forward to seeing how Ryan Sessegnon does at Hoffenheim, and wonder where he\u2019ll play for them. Ed won\u2019t thank me for saying this, but I\u2019d love love love to see Zaha play for Simeone\u2019s Atl\u00e9tico. Talking of United, Roma are shaking out their washing and digging down the back of the sofa to see if they can find the money to buy Chris Smalling. If Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has any sense, Smalling will be in the middle of his defence for the game at Newcastle in two weeks. \u201cManchester United aren\u2019t my team,\u201d brags/confesses K\u00e1ri Tulinius, \u201cbut they\u2019re on television a lot, and so I\u2019m rooting for Sarr to go there because I always enjoy watching Sarr play. He\u2019s one of those players who appears slower than he is, so when he hares down the field with the ball he looks like a special effect from an 80s superhero film.\u201d They are, I\u2019m afraid, my team, so I\u2019d be interested in hearing more on Sarr. I think he\u2019s a good player, but I\u2019ve not seen enough to know whether he\u2019s good enough to help them get where they\u2019d like to go. \u201cI also don\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 Ruben Loftus-Cheek,\u201d says Oliver. \u201cIt seems he\u2019s just a fancy utility player, possibly the 2010s version of James Milner? What I get even less is why Chelsea think he is worth an \u00a38m loan fee and, reportedly, \u00a3175,000 big ones a month. I get that these kind of deals are the way they make their money year after year, but surely even they can see that asking for that fee to, in essence, nurse a player back to fitness on their behalf for a year is ridiculous? Anyhow, off to carry on waiting for David Sullivan to announce how hard he\u2019s tried to sign a player this window but just didn\u2019t have time, money, or both.\u201d Words that should never appear in the same sentence... \u201cI might be late to the party on this one,\u201d says Darrien Bold, \u201cbut I\u2019ve just spotted tenacious midfielder Vinny Samways socially distancing outside a trendy Liverpool cafe as rumours of him bolstering Everton\u2019s title charge for a cool \u00a32 million do the rounds...\u201d Vincent Sideways, that takes me back. Anyone caught sight of Paul Moran, Andy Turner and Dean Marney? I can\u2019t vouch for the veracity of this, but Man United are, say various \u201csources\u201d, trying to sign Ismaila Sarr. This makes some sense \u2013 despite appearing to be in the process of signing two right-wingers, they need a right-winger \u2013 but Watford want a penalty of \u20ac25m inserted into any loan deal, should United not take up an opiton to buy. I\u2019ll level with youse: I don\u2019t quite get Loftus-Cheek. What does he do, and what is his position? He might well be a Premier League player, but I\u2019ve not seen much to suggests he\u2019s a Champions League player. Fulham: Fulham are closing in on their defensive reinforcements. PSV\u2019s Timo Baumgartl and Lyon\u2019s Joachim Andersen are on the way to Craven Cottage on season-long loans. Fulham are still in the hunt for Chelsea\u2019s Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Meanwhile Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger turned down a move to West Ham. Thanks Baz, and welcome to the next instalment of pre-slamming shut action. And stuff\u2019s actually happening, which makes a change! That\u2019s all from me. On a day that Arsenal handing Gunnersaurus his P45 to help free up cash to pay Thomas Partey\u2019s \u00a345m Atletico Madrid release clause, I\u2019m off to weep salty tears for a big cuddly dinosaur. Daniel Harris will take you through the next few hours of .... not much happening. Arsenal: Arsenal fans, assemble! Things are stirring regarding the Gunners\u2019 pursuit of Thomas Partey. While his club, Atletico Madrid, had not received an offer yet I understand reports elsewhere that Arsenal have expressed an intention to meet his \u20ac50m release fee today are accurate. It would then mean a late dash to complete the medical; I believe personal terms would be no problem at all, as this move has been in the planning for a very long time indeed. Arsenal might just be about to get their man, but it\u2019ll be tight ... An email: \u201cI\u2019m kinda convinced it\u2019ll all end in tears and can he, at the age of 31 (is Theo Walcott really 31?!), cope with Ralph\u2019s hard pressing style?,\u201d writes Southampton fan Steve Hoare. \u201cBut, but, but... ask Robin van Persie how good he is? He attributed his last few great seasons at Arsenal to Theo\u2019s creativity. I know that seems like a long time ago but he\u2019s hardly knackered himself through weight of games. He\u2019s a better finisher than all our front men bar Danny. I still wish he\u2019d had more of a chance centrally, where he often shone at Arsenal. So, welcome home Theo!\u201d Sky Sports: Working from home but giving the lowdown on Fulham\u2019s search for a new centre-half, Gail Davis appears to be reporting from her living room. In the background, a very good doggo, what looks like a grey whippet, is dozing on the sofa. As Gail tells us about Joachim Anderson, the dog wakes up and begins licking itself. Arsenal: \u201cAm following the deadline day updates feverishly (because I need a hobby or two),\u201d writes Ravi Mani. \u201cI was just wondering, with Gunnersaurus sadly leaving the club, could Mesut Ozil not take up the costume? He\u2019s neither playing nor going anywhere.\u201d Fulham: \u201cAccording to usually well informed Danish outlet Ekstra Bladet, Joachim Andersen and his father is on their way to London for a medical at Fulham,\u201d writes reader Lars B\u00f8gegaard, whose name seems reasonably authentic. \u201cHe\u2019s the Danish player with the highest transfer fee ever.\u201d Anderson moved from Sampdoria to Lyon for \u00a321.6m in July 2019. One presumes it is he who will be doing a medical at Fulham, rather than his dad. Merse speaks: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot of money at all for the quality of player you\u2019re getting here,\u201d he says on Sky Sports, when asked what Thomas Partey could bring to the Arsenal ... eh, Party. \u201cThe one thing he brings as well: discipline. He\u2019s played at Atletico Madrid, who are one of the most disciplined teams in Europe. He\u2019s not a midfielder who goes running all over the place, leaving you wondering \u2018Where\u2019s he gone?\u2019. I think he\u2019ll be a great signing.\u201d Arsenal: Stuck with Mesut Ozil, a Gunnersaurus down and on the verge of shipping Matteo Guendouzi out to Hertha Berlin, Arsenal are reported to have made a \u00a345m bid for Atletico Madrid Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey. Chelsea: On Antonio Rudiger, Chelsea\u2019s position at the moment is that they want a straight loan for him (with no option or obligation) or a loan with an option to buy at a certain sum but with a buy-back clause at less than the value of that option. In other words, if a club were to take Rudiger permanently, they could end up making a loss if they were to sell him back to Chelsea. Hmmm. Not sure how attractive that is. Feels like a good example of the little details in these kind of deals that are argued over endlessly. Rudiger could be one that keeps us up late tonight \u2026 One from left-field: Wigan defender Danny Fox is to join the Indian Super League side East Bengal in a year-long loan deal. Fox will almost certainly play under Robbie Fowler, who ibelieved to have agreed a deal to manage the club in their maiden ISL season. An email: \u201cRegarding what Saints fans think about Walcott returning: from the footballing perspective, I\u2019m indifferent,\u201d writes Southampton fan Adam Kline-Schoder. \u201cI think he\u2019s past his prime and I don\u2019t expect him to be pulling up any trees on the pitch. That said, I think Saints\u2019 wide players are relatively young and inexperienced, which is where he can come in. \u201cDespite his flaws and the question marks over whether he really fulfilled his potential, he has Champions League and World Cup experience as well as having played for an established top six club. From interviews he seems well-spoken and measured but tough, and although of course that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate directly into being a strong mentor I hope that he\u2019s able to give our wide players more (a) consistency and (b) strings to their collective bow ... and ideally contribute a few goals to take the load off of Danny Ings.\u201d Manchester United: \u201cI don\u2019t see any way in which Jadon Sancho ends up at Manchester United today,\u201d says Didi Hamann, who is working for Sky Germany. He goes on to say he doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance Sancho will leave Borussia Dortmund in January either. Southampton: Theo Walcott has agreed to go on loan from Everton to Southampton, where it all began for him. He\u2019s on his way to do a medical and it\u2019s being reported that Southampton will pay half his wages. How do we feel about that one, Southampton fans? Excited or indifferent? Everton: Despite Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s recent claim that Everton are not looking for another goalkeeper, Everton are looking for another goalkeeper. The Premier League leaders have been in contact with Manchester United over a possible loan deal for Sergio Romero and also with Tottenham over a loan for Paulo Gazzaniga. United and Spurs would both prefer a permanent transfer, but talks are ongoing for the two keepers as Ancelotti looks to increase pressure on the erratic Jordan Pickford. Sky Sports: The network\u2019s Transfer Talk show is on at the moment, featuring a \u201cwall\u201d of 40 or 50 excitable competition-winning viewers in the background looking very excited in the background. No sign of any roll-up cigarettes, rude signs or sex toys yet, but you\u2019ll be the first to hear about it should any appear. Meanwhile away from the studio, the army of transfer Deadline Day Sky Sports reporters are reporting from a variety of locations. Tim Thornton is at Elland Road, Vinny O\u2019Connor is at Everton\u2019s Finch Farm training ground, Paul Gilmour is at Tottenham\u2019s well-appointed training ground, while Southampton reporter Becky Williams is working from home. Emma Paton, who is bringing us all the latest gossip on Arsenal and Chelsea, is at the Sky Sports studios, but moving around from one location to another to in a bid to keep us on our toes. Bournemouth: The Championship club have rebuffed a \u201cderisory\u201d bid from Serie A Torino for Joshua King. The Norway striker is out of contract next summer and Bournemouth, who have already lost Callum Wilson, Nathan Ake and Aaron Ramsdale following relegation, were resigned to losing King for a cut-price fee but a scenario whereby the forward stays put is increasingly likely. Leicester: Defender Josh Knight, who spent last season at Peterborough, is set to join Wycombe on loan. Fulham: A centre-back could be on the way in at Fulham! PSV\u2019s German defender Timo Baumgartl is closing in on a season\u2019s loan to Craven Cottage after completing a medical. The 24-year-old joined PSV from Stuttgart last summer. All being well they will also bring in Joachim Andersen on loan from Lyon, while there\u2019s a lot of talk that a move for Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek could be on. Ben Godfrey has moved from Norwich City to Everton for a fee that could reach \u00a330m. Theo Walcott could be on his way back to Southampton on loan from Everton. Manchester United are about to sign Porto left-back Alex Telles and free agent striker Edinson Cavani. United are still interested in signing Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele, as their hopes of getting Jadon Sancho in from Borussia Dortmund fade. Tottenham Hotspur left-back Ryan Sessegnon is off to Bundesliga side Hoffenheim on a season long loan. Leeds have agreed a deal to sign Brazilian winger Raphinha from Rennes. The bloke who Nobody wants Mesut Ozil, including Arsenal ... who are stuck with him. Arsenal have, however, managed to get much-loved mascot Gunnersaurus off the payroll, with reports suggesting Jerry Quy, who has occupied the dinosaur suit for 27 years has been let go in order to cut costs. No, really. Celtic: The Scottish champions are close to agreeing a loan deal for AC Milan left-back Diego Laxalt, according to Sky Italy. The Uruguay international has played 35 times for Milan since moving from Genoa in 2018 but is surplus to requirements at the San Siro. Celtic are believed to be interested in taking him on loan, with an option to buy for around \u00a39m come season\u2019s end. Mesut Ozil news: There is no news to report on Mesut Ozil. Arsenal have had no offers of any kind for their biggest earner, who they are eager to get off the payroll. Southampton: Southampton are keen to get Angus Gunn some minutes, with Stoke City at the front of a queue in terms of a loan move for the goalkeeper, who is now behind Alex McCarthy and Fraser Forster in the pecking order. Saints paid \u00a313.5m for Gunn, the son of former Norwich goalkeeper Bryan, in 2018. Joining Sofiane Boufal andWesley Hoedt in heading out of the door could be former club-record signing Guido Carrillo, who could be allowed to return to La Liga with Elche on a free. Carrillo, signed for \u00a319m in 2018, is thought to be one of the club\u2019s highest earners. West Ham: Republic of Ireland international midfielder Josh Cullen is on the verge of joining Belgian side Anderlecht on a three-year deal for a fee believed to be around \u00a31m. Managerial moves: Away from transfer news, a bit of manager movement: Gerhard Struber is leaving Barnsley of the Championship for New York Red Bulls of the MLS. New York have activated a seven-figure release clause, thought to be around \u20ac2m, and from that moment Barnsley have been powerless to keep the Austrian, who has close links with the Red Bull group having previously coached Red Bull Salzburg at youth level. Adam Murry is expected to take caretaker charge. Arsenal news: I\u2019m told the Guendouzi loan to Hertha Berlin, trailed earlier, will be confirmed soon. One of Arsenal\u2019s young defenders, the 21-year-old centre-back Daniel Ballard, is also going out on loan to Blackpool in League One, another move that should be rubber-stamped before long. There should be more to follow ... Fulham news: Along with trying to bring in Ruben Loftus-Cheek on loan, Fulham are also chasing defensive signings. They\u2019re hopeful of making two centre-back signings today. Lyon centre-back Joachim Andersen is a possibility. It\u2019s also been reported that they could sign William Saliba on loan from Arsenal. Ben Godfrey: On Sky Sports, former Liverpool player Stephen Warnock is looking a little Clark Kent in his big black specs and he\u2019s talking up the merits of Ben Godfrey, who has made the move from Norwich City to Everton. \u201cSpeed, agility, youth ... he\u2019s a young player looking to progress his career as well,\u201d says Stephen. Southampton news: \u201cSouthampton are hopeful of re-signing Theo Walcott on a loan deal from Everton. Saints have been in talks over striking a deal which ensures Everton stump up a reasonable amount of Walcott\u2019s wages, with a deal likely. The 31-year-old, who progressed through the Saints\u2019 revered academy, left St Mary\u2019s to join Arsenal in 2006. Ralph Hasenhuttl indicated the club would be in for a busy 24 hours after victory over West Brom on Sunday and they are open to a couple of loan deals. They had targeted Brandon Williams from Manchester United, who would have provided back-up at full-back, but that move appears unlikely. Heading out the door? Sofiane Boufal is set to return to France with Angers on a free transfer, and Wesley Hoedt, who is set to re-sign for Lazio, from whom Southampton signed him for \u00a315m, most likely on a season\u2019s loan. Liverpool news: Sunday\u2019s humiliation at Villa Park will not panic Liverpool into any deadline day signings but there could be a departure or two from Anfield before the close of play. Werder Bremen want Marko Grujic and the Serbia midfielder is keen on a return to the Bundesliga but, having allowed him to spend the last two seasons on loan at Hertha Berlin, Liverpool will not sanction a third season-long loan move. Bremen will have to stump up the cash for a player that Liverpool value at around \u00a320m and that may prove beyond them. Xherdan Shaqiri\u2019s representatives are continuing to explore options for the Switzerland international, although the Premier League champions have received no offers so far. Harry Wilson is another who can leave but Burnley have not returned with a second bid for the Wales international. Ben Godfrey has changed his Twitter bio to say he\u2019s an @everton player and here\u2019s why. He may have to bide his time before forcing himself into the first team, as he\u2019ll do well to displace either Yerry Mina or Michael Keane after their excellent performances against Brighton at the weekend. Good morning, all. Well, isn\u2019t this exciting? Ryan Sessegnon to Hoffenheim, eh? Innit? Marvellous. On Sky Sports News, German football guru Ralf Rangnick says it\u2019s a deal that\u2019s ideal for Hoffenheim, because \u201cthey could do with a wing-back or a left-back and Sessegnon can play in both positions. We\u2019ve been watching him for the last couple of years when he was still at Fulham and since he\u2019s not playing regularly at Tottenham I think this move makes sense for both clubs and also the player himself.\u201d With that, I\u2019m off to see my agent. Barry Glendenning will take over for the next however-long. You can email him here or Tweet him here. Bye! The Gazzetta dello Sport are reporting that Chris Smalling flew into Rome overnight on a private plane arranged by his agent, and that he\u2019s now lurking in the Italian capital in the hope that Manchester United at some point agree to sell him. The chances of Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 moving from Barcelona to Manchester United today appear to be shrinking: it is now being reported by RMC Sport, the French TV network, that the Frenchman will be staying at Barcelona and is focused on his season in Spain. Fulham are interested in signing Ruben Loftus-Cheek on loan from Chelsea. It remains to be seen if they can afford the midfielder, though: he earns \u00a3150,000 a week. One outgoing at West Ham is set to be Josh Cullen. The 24-year-old midfielder is joining Anderlecht on a three-year deal for \u00a3500,000. Our bumper transfer window megafile is being constantly updated. You can find it here: Apparently Edinson Cavani and Alex Telles are now at Carrington, Manchester United\u2019s training ground, and soon to put pen to paper. But there is lots of chatter today about the possibility of the club settling on Facundo Pellistri, an 18-year-old Uruguayan currently at Penarol, as the answer to their search for a winger. It\u2019s now being reported that Emerson to Juventus is off. The Italians have failed to agree a deal with Chelsea. So, will it be Marcos Alonso to leave? Sky are reporting that Leicester\u2019s Rachid Ghezzal is in Istanbul and will move on loan to Besiktas today subject to him passing a medical. The Algerian has played 733 league minutes for the Foxes since joining in August 2018. The former Manchester United full-back Matteo Darmian has left Parma to join Internazionale on loan with an obligation to buy. West Ham are still looking for a centre-back and are interested in Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Jonathan Tah after having offers for several other targets turned down. However I\u2019ve been told that they could be priced out of a move for Tah, with Leverkusen demanding \u20ac30m for the German. We could see West Ham dip into the Championship - Watford\u2019s Craig Dawson is being mentioned. As for Declan Rice, it is very unlikely that he will join Chelsea today. It\u2019s too late for West Ham to source a replacement. What does our very own Jonathan Wilson think about Manchester United\u2019s rumour deadline-day transfer dealings? The left-back Alex Telles should arrive from Porto on Monday \u2013 although he could hardly be blamed for having second thoughts \u2013 but the other talk was of Edinson Cavani and a loan for Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. They\u2019re all very fine players, but they feel somewhere between an irrelevance and a distraction. Oh. Read what else Wilson has to say about United here: Unless Chelsea spring a late surprise, expect it to be outgoings rather than incomings at Stamford Bridge. Frank Lampard has already spent heavily and needs to trim his squad - he has three left-backs and five centre-backs. On the left-back front, it will be either Marcos Alonso or Emerson Palmieri moving. Inter have been interested in both; Juventus are making a last-ditch effort to sign Emerson. As for the centre-backs, Antonio Rudiger looks the likeliest to leave after being frozen out by Lampard. PSG and Tottenham are interested in the German. Milan seems unlikely. Plenty of fringe players need moves. Victor Moses could go to Inter on loan and Tiemoue Bakayoko looks set for Napoli. I\u2019m told that Callum Hudson-Odoi is staying. Bayern Munich offered Chelsea a loan with a \u00a370m option to buy on Saturday. It was rejected - Chelsea want the winger to stay. It also seems that Ruben Loftus-Cheek could stay put. Lampard is open to the midfielder going on loan but Southampton and West Ham deem him too expensive. Fulham are another option but wouldn\u2019t he just lose most weeks? Word is that PSG have signed the 29-year-old defensive midfielder from Porto on loan, with an obligation to buy next year for \u20ac16m. Done deal! Ryan Sessegnon joins Hoffenheim on loan until 30 June 2021. \u201cHoffenheim are known for the successful training and development of young players,\u201d the player said. \u201cI hope that the move will give me match experience in one of the best leagues in the world and I\u2019m looking forward to playing in Europe.\u201d Some further detail on the fate of Gunnersaurus: it\u2019s not extinction, just hibernation. The costume will return when fans do, but the man who has occupied it since 1993 will not. Jerry Quy, the man behind the mask for more than a quarter of a century, is to retire. Here\u2019s an article about him being good at bowling. Manchester United\u2019s 6-1 humiliation by Tottenham at Old Trafford on Sunday has had no impact on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s position as the manager. The club remains firmly and totally behind him, is the understanding. It is being widely reported this morning that Arsenal have euthanised Gunnersaurus in a cost-cutting measure. Farewell, friendly green giant. If you want a further transfusion of rumourplasma, hook yourself up to this: Our friends at Get French Football News have sent over a few headlines from the other side of la Manche: 28-year-old right-sided player Bouna Sarr is undergoing a medical with Bayern Munich this morning ahead of a \u20ac10m move from Marseille. The deal is expected to see Micha\u00ebl Cuisance come the other way on loan with an option to buy, although final details for the 21-year-old\u2019s arrival still require sorting. Cuisance arrived in Marseille last night. PSG are expected to announce the \u20ac4m loan with \u20ac16m obligation to buy signing of 29-year-old defensive midfielder Danilo Pereira from Porto. PSG manager Thomas Tuchel would still like to sign Antonio R\u00fcdiger on loan from Chelsea. Jeff Reine Ad\u00e9la\u00efde will decide whether or not to accept a \u20ac27m move from Lyon to Hertha Berlin. Rennes will announce the club record \u20ac26m + bonuses signing of J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku from Anderlecht. Metz striker Habib Diallo remains in touch with Sheffield United and West Brom as he seeks to exit Les Grenats in a \u20ac15m deal - Strasbourg making a surprising, late charge for the Senegalese international. Rennes have accepted a \u20ac17m + \u20ac6m bonuses offer from Leeds United for Brazilian winger Raphinha - deal rests on the player being granted a work permit this morning. Christian Atsu could well be on his way out of Newcastle today, it seems. He has played just 10 Carabao Cup minutes this season and otherwise not even made the bench, having been at least on the bench for 27 of their 38 Premier League games last season. A loan move to a Championship club is being mooted. The precise makeup of Arsenal\u2019s squad in 14 hours\u2019 time is anyone\u2019s guess but we have a couple of early near-certainties. It appears Mikel Arteta will be able to wash his hands of Matteo Guendouzi for the rest of this season at least; the out-of-favour midfielder should complete a loan move to Hertha Berlin later. Expect Lucas Torreira to seal a similar switch to Atletico Madrid, while Sead Kolasinac was left out of yesterday\u2019s squad and could yet return to Germany on a permanent basis. William Saliba and, as an outside shout, Reiss Nelson are others who could be loaned out today. Where incomings are concerned, it\u2019s all even cloudier. Houssem Aouar confirmed last night that, for now at least, he will be staying at Lyon so it would be a huge surprise if that deal was revived at the last. If Arsenal can find a straight-up \u20ac50m between now and 11pm they could yet get Thomas Partey through the door \u2013 the player would make the move if his release clause was met \u2013 but the Kroenkes would have to dig deep. Jorginho seems an even more unlikely arrival than he did already, given his weekend performance for Chelsea. But Arteta did say yesterday that he was confident Arsenal were doing their utmost to get deals done. I definitely wouldn\u2019t rule out something appearing from the left field as the day develops ... Norwich had three promising young defenders last season, and two of them have now gone: Jamal Lewis to Newcastle and now Ben Godfrey to Everton. What next for Max Aarons, perhaps the best of the three? The right-back was linked with Barcelona last month, prompting Daniel Farke to say \u201cI wouldn\u2019t sell Max Aarons, not for \u00a3100m\u201d. Time will tell, I suppose. Tuttosport seem absolutely convinced that Federico Chiesa will sign for Juventus today, for around \u20ac50m. Fiorentina may well replace him with Watford\u2019s Gerard Deulofeu, who is hoping to seal a move away from the Championship club before the day is out Everton have announced the arrival of Ben Godfrey from Norwich, the 22-year-old centre-back said to have cost a fee in the region of \u00a310m (update: Sky are valuing the deal at double that), who has signed a five-year deal. This is what he had to say about it, to the club\u2019s website: It is an honour to sign for Everton and to be part of a huge club. I am very thankful for the opportunity and I can\u2019t wait to get started. The aim for me at Everton is to win trophies and win games. I like to win. I wear my heart on my sleeve. I care and I am a passionate lad. The fans can guarantee they will get 110% out of me when I am on the pitch. This is a club full of history that has an exciting team full of world-class players who will help me kick on to the next level. I am looking forward to working with them and, hopefully, having great times with Everton Football Club. The manager\u2019s past speaks for itself. He has worked with some top-class centre-backs. I will be able to learn so much from him and he is going to help me get to that next level, which is where I want to be. Rumours of a return to the south coast for Theo Walcott have been building for a couple of days now, and word on the street is that talks between Southampton and Everton have begun: A deal for Jadon Sancho to move to Manchester United now has only a remote chance of happening with the club hierarchy remaining firm that Borussia Dortmund\u2019s indications that \u20ac120m is wanted for the forward is unrealistic in the current coronavirus-affected market. While United respect Dortmund\u2019s position, the high fee demanded by the player\u2019s agent is also a major block to the transfer. As right wing is a priority and given Sancho\u2019s arrival appears unlikely, talks are ongoing regarding other options, with a loan for Barcelona\u2019s Ousmane Dembele, at the head of these. Before Monday\u2019s transfer deadline United expect to announce the signings of Edinson Cavani, the 33-year-old Uruguayan striker, on a free transfer, and the \u20ac17m (plus bonuses) purchase of Porto\u2019s left-back, Alex Telles. The latter has been bought to compete with Luke Shaw and offer a greater goal threat. The former was a pragmatic, opportunist signing, it is understood, Cavani being recruited to ensure that when Odion Igahlo\u2019s loan expires in January Solskjaer has a replacement centre-forward already in place. Cavani is also wanted to help continue the development of Mason Greenwood, and support Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. Manchester City do not expect to sign anyone more unless an unexpected - and acceptable - bid for Oleksander Zinchenko occurs, with Pep Guardiola believing the left-back position requires strengthening. Central defender Eric Garcia could still leave for Barcelona if a deal between City and the Catalan club can be agreed. Sky are reporting that Leeds United have agreed a deal with Rennes for the right winger Raphinha, a 23-year-old Brazilian who has a goal and two assists from five starts in Ligue 1 so far this season.
