It\u2019s hard not to think that he might have been better off going to a Greek island. Especially at the start, heading to the coastal town of Lowestoft on \u201cone of the old diesel trains, grimed with oil and soot up to the windows\u201d on a \u201cgrey, overcast day\u201d. It gets worse when he finally arrives and finds it \u201crun down\u201d and deserted. \u201cI was unprepared for the feeling of wretchedness that instantly seized hold of me,\u201d he says. When he strolls out of town, walking through \u201cblue petrol fumes\u201d and past \u201cdecommissioned and unemployed trawlers\u201d, there is still more desolation in store. The sparse moorlands and dark pebble beaches of Suffolk are hardly a tonic against emptiness \u2013 in fact, they often seem to embody the feeling that Sebald\u2019s narrator is seeking to escape. Still, it could be worse \u2013 for example, he could be in exile with Joseph Conrad\u2019s father Apollo Korzeniowski in Vologoda. There, we are told: \u201cDuring the green winter it rains week in week out. The mud creeps over the threshold, rigor mortis is temporarily lifted and a few signs of life, in the form of all-pervasive marasmus, begin to manifest themselves. In the white winter everything is dead, during the green winter everything is dying.\u201d As well as throwing Suffolk into comparatively positive relief, this story about poor old Apollo also demonstrates how flat and empty coastlines can actually prove useful to someone hoping to fill in a void, providing an uncluttered canvas to be populated with figures from history and fiction. There\u2019s enough to prompt and inspire reflection, and enough space to allow thoughts to roam free. That quote about Conrad\u2019s father is typical of the thoughts that flow into the narrator\u2019s mind. Everywhere, he sees death and destruction. He is haunted by victims of historical calamity, ill fortune and injustice. Shades of the Holocaust always seem to be at the edge of his vision, while those in focus reveal dreadful truths. Here he is on the death of the Chinese Empress Dowager Tz\u2019u-hsi: \u201cLooking back, she said, she realised that history consists of nothing but misfortune and the troubles that afflict us, so that in all our days on Earth we never know one single moment that is genuinely free of fear.\u201d Following a description of a bloody battle, we get: \u201cWithin the overall context of the task of remembering, such colourful accounts of military spectacles and large-scale operations form what might be called the highlights of history which staggers blindly from one disaster to the next.\u201d Towards the end of the novel there\u2019s also an incredible description of the lifework of Thomas Abrams. This erstwhile farmer has dedicated years \u2013 decades \u2013 to building a scale model of the Temple of Jerusalem. How does he feel about this astonishing creation? \u201cI sometimes wonder if I will ever finish the Temple and whether all I have done so far has not been a wretched waste of time.\u201d Accompanying this cheering material are a number of ongoing metaphors and story strands. Most particularly, the narrator returns again and again to the theme of silk. Mulberry trees, silkworms, and silk clothes, cloths and carpets appear throughout The Rings of Saturn. We see the dark nets of silk used to catch herring, the fish throttled to death in an eight-hour process. The Empress Dowager has a daily blood sacrifice made in her temple \u201cto the gods of silk\u201d. Twice we encounter people hanged by \u201csilken rope\u201d. The weavers, we are told, \u201cspent their lives with their wretched bodies strapped to looms made of wooden frames and rails, hung with weights, and reminiscent of instruments of torture or cages\u201d. This thread comes to an end in the final pages, with descriptions of the use of silkworms in Nazi Germany, and the way they were killed \u2013 suspended for hours over boiling cauldrons. Curiously, by the end of this \u201clong account of calamities\u201d, I no longer felt the narrator had made a mistake in visiting Suffolk. The ghosts that rushed in to fill the emptiness may have been melancholy, but there was also something cathartic about the whole process. There was the compensation of art, the beauty of his descriptions and clarity of observation. Our narrator had taken on our history, and hadn\u2019t hidden from the truth. And if it was saturnine \u2013 well, that was the point."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
