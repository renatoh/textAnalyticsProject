I turned to see a man who resembled a wildly over-stimulated version of TV geographer Nicholas Crane unloading his woes on an elderly couple across the aisle. Man \"I mean, the Victorians were going faster than this! Stevenson's Rocket would be coming down here at, I won't say 100 miles per hour, 90 though, at least!\" Old Woman \"And now you've got all those other stations on the way.\" Man (calming himself for a moment) \"It's a strange world.\" Old Woman \"Yes, it is.\" Man (melting back into a frenzy) \"You've got the TGV in France, the bullet train in Japan. Why do we put up with it? Why?\" Old Woman (realising she no longer wanted to talk to him) \"Mmm.\" Man (regardless) \"My favourite system is the Swiss network.\" Old Woman (willing him to cease) \"Mmm.\" Old Man \"I think we're almost in Newcastle.\" Man (irate) \"This is Gosforth!\" Old Man (to his wife) \"We'll get a cab from the station.\" Man (uninvited) \"Well, be advised. The centre of Newcastle is a no-go area. You can't take a car anywhere near it!\" He picked his bags and leaned over his victims. \"Of course, my mother whizzes round the centre at 82. She's a brave old soul.\" The implication being that his mother was a better class of pensioner altogether, and with that he dragged his bags towards the exit. Old man (loudly, so as to disassociate himself from him) \"Well I'm glad he's gone.\" Audibly, the rest of the carriage exhaled in agreement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
