Free from the cloying claustrophobia of rural life, the city was always a place to lose yourself. Within its winding alleys, dense housing and teeming markets, the urban was a place of anonymity and isolation. It was somewhere you couldn't be found. But cities have traditionally also been places of intelligence, creativity and innovation. Thanks to their commercial and industrial wealth, urban hubs, from Renaissance Tuscany to modern California, have attracted the finest artists and scientists of their day. So it is no surprise that since the popular emergence of maps in the late 15th century, cities have been subject to some of the most exacting as well as artistic examples of cartography, as can be seen in a new book, Cities of the World: A History in Maps. Jerusalem was far and away the most popular subject of map-making among medieval cartographers. And that gives some sense of the underlying motive behind cartography. For Jerusalem has always been as much a city of the imagination as a bricks-and-mortar urban form. And so with maps: they are as much signifiers of urban identity, municipal rivalry and civic aggrandisement as any realistic image of the city. They are works of fiction that offer subtle insights into the urban mentality of the era. Long before aerial photography or GPS, the map-makers gave themselves a bird's-eye panorama of their cities and decided what was and was not important. So, in the case of medieval Constantinople, Hagia Sophia towers monstrously over the city; in Cambridge, it is the curiously outproportioned King's College chapel. And just we forge a mental map of our communities or cities - the pub, the shop, the isolated bench - so map-makers draw an aesthetic vision of what constitutes the significance of the city: a celebration of its urban USP. In Cambridge, it is colleges; in Constantinople, a rich heritage of Romano-Christian civilisation. Maps are also about power. Medieval cartographers typically worked for specific patrons - usually indicated by large crests (the Cambridge map is intriguing for its absence of royal iconography). Their demands frequently determined the contours of the mapped city. But cartographers also recorded the power struggle - between church and state; landowners and tenants; engineering and environment - which combined to make up the shape of the city. Bernard Ratzer's aerial map of New York clearly reveals the land-owner patterns carving up Manhattan. And with its very detailed imagery of harbours, water currents and local terrain, the map was also employed for another highly popular use of cartography: the exertion of military might. The map was swiftly reissued by the British in the run-up to the war of independence. Yet what Cities of the World, from which these maps are taken, also emphasises is the seductive power of cartography. Just as one can wallow happily in the minutiae of an A-Z, so it seems easy to sit and stare at these wondrous records of urban life. And that is the best way to approach the pre-1950s map: as a beguiling work of art opening up the civic sensibilities of lost civilisations. \u00b7 Cities of the World: A History in Maps is published by the British Library, price \u00a325"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
