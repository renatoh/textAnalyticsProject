She has a penchant for the word \u201crather\u201d that doesn\u2019t quite chime with being an 18-year-old who lives in Brooklyn. If she didn\u2019t work so much, she would take up pottery classes. And she isn\u2019t much for going out \u2013 even when the world isn\u2019t in lockdown. It all seems a bit coy for a teenager on the brink of stardom. Lillis is in the midst of building an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9. She had her first big hits playing Beverly Marsh in Stephen King\u2019s 2017 thriller, It, and a younger Amy Adams in Sharp Objects in 2018. The following year, she landed the lead in Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase. Lillis was seven when her stepdad first asked her to star in his class film project. But it wasn\u2019t until she was in high school, finishing the filming of It \u2013 her first feature movie \u2013 that she finally figured out she wanted to act long-term. Now she is starring the Netflix adaptation of Charles Forsman\u2019s I Am Not Okay With This. Lillis plays Sydney Novak, an awkward 17-year-old coming to terms with her sexuality while getting over her dad\u2019s suicide. Plus, Novak just so happens to have superpowers that are triggered by intense feelings \u2013 like a modern-day Matilda, but less PG. I caught up with her to discuss her life in isolation now that she\u2019s off set and stuck in New York for the foreseeable future. If we were able to meet in person as planned, we would have gone to Lillis\u2019s favorite Brooklyn diner. She would have ordered pancakes or waffles and a side of sausages, and a vanilla egg cream (seltzer, milk, whipped cream and syrup, in case you were wondering). Instead, we meet over Zoom, of course, but she tells me she still got dressed up for the chat. For her, that means swapping out two-day old pyjamas for one of her more colorful outfits (she usually just wears black) \u2013 a black top with flowers on it and a scraggly yellow jacket. Her characteristic short, ginger hair is tucked behind her ears and she\u2019s wearing a huge grin on her face. In I Am Not Okay With This, that ear-to-ear grin is normally seen whenever her best friend, Dina, is around, because she is in love with her. The rest of the time Sydney Novak can be seen fuming, watching the contents of store shelves, libraries and entire forests come crashing down at the behest of her uncontrollable teenage emotions. They are dark, deep, contorted. So contorted, in fact, that Novak ends up accidentally blowing somebody\u2019s head off at the end of the series. I ask her about her own real-life emotions: is there an emotion she would get rid of given the chance? \u201cOh God, my anxiety. I have this tendency to just rethink things from five years ago like over and over,\u201d she says. Over Zoom, Lillis does not come across as anxious. She laughs at how her friends are unfazed by her acting career (\u201cI dunno why, they just never seem interested \u2026 they\u2019re more like, \u2018Let\u2019s go hang out at the park and have a picnic,\u2019 rather than, \u2018Let\u2019s go out and party with all these famous people around,\u2019 that kind of junk,\u201d she says). She tells me she is \u201chorrible at socializing\u201d but she doesn\u2019t seem that way to me \u2013 deprecating, yes, but in a quietly self-assured kind of way. She seems at ease with herself. I also didn\u2019t find her to be \u201chorrible at interviews\u201d, which she thinks she is. At most, she is a little nervous, but well prepared. Lillis says she has learned to deal with some of the pressures of fame by prepping. Before interviews, she anticipates what questions she might be asked and writes her answers. Lillis gets anxious about social interactions. She tells me she looks up to her twin brother, Jake, because she sees him as being effortlessly sociable. That\u2019s a stark contrast to how she sees herself, which is why she asks him to chaperone her to press parties, in case someone comes over to speak to her. \u201cI feel like with him I can talk freely. I can talk to him, so it looks like I\u2019m socializing, and if there\u2019s someone who actually comes up he can help speak for me,\u201d she says. She outsources nearly all of her social media management to him, too, which may explain why it doesn\u2019t feel all that personal \u2013 aside from brief snapshots of her smirking behind her ugly, hairless cat\u2019s head, you don\u2019t see much of the real Lillis on it. It is mostly a tonne of promotional material. \u201cI am always terrified \u2026 Whatever you post, there\u2019s always something wrong with it,\u201d says Lillis. So, I ask, what would people see if they saw the real Lillis? \u201cI really haven\u2019t had a very exciting life other than maybe making films,\u201d she says. In fact, the most social thing she has done lately is play Animal Crossing on her own at home: \u201cYou basically just build a town, that\u2019s all there is. You build a town and go to other people\u2019s towns, and actually that is mainly how I have been socializing [during the quarantine].\u201d Most of the characters Lillis plays onscreen are troubled \u2013 abused, neglected, grieving. I ask her what experiences she draws on from her life to pull out the angst that her characters go through. \u201cAlmost all of [my characters] are in the process of growing up. Everyone has hardships, no matter how large or small, so I just try to use as much of those as possible.\u201d But in her real life, Lillis is very protected. Her mom is close behind her in all of her work ventures - from arranging interviews, to choosing appropriate jobs. She hangs out in the background of our Zoom chat when we speak. \u201cI feel like at least 80% of my job is supported and/or done by my mom,\u201d says Lillis. \u201cShe helps me with my lines, reads through \u2019em with me every single day. She helps me choose the jobs, she reads the scripts beforehand and then sends them over to me,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s not a moment when she\u2019s not helping me.\u201d At the end of the school year, Lillis will graduate high school and plans to focus on acting instead of going to college. She may even get a place of her own near her family home in Brooklyn. \u201cI know my mom is probably going to step in like, every two days, to make sure I\u2019m still alive. Probably in the midst of doing so, [she will] get angry with how messy it is and then clean my room and make me make myself dinner,\u201d says Lillis. Is it ever too much? I ask. \u201cNo, not really,\u201d says Lillis. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s mostly her needing a break from me,\u201d she says. It\u2019s hard to tell whether you\u2019re getting the full picture when her parents are right there. But perhaps that\u2019s the point \u2013 Lillis is in her formative years and suddenly has found fame and all the excess that comes with it. And yet, she has managed to stay out of the limelight for anything other than being a hard-working, sort of goofy and lovable actress. Why mess that up now by saying the wrong thing? \u201cI don\u2019t have real reasons for strife,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI can get kinda anxious sometimes, but then again making movies can be sometimes stressful because I want to do well and not screw up for everybody.\u201d This story was amended to remove a reference to Lillis playing \u201ca younger Jessica Chastain\u201d in It. In It: Chapter Two, Chastain played an older version of the same character Lillis played, but they were not simultaneously involved in the 2017 film."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
