Hoddle saw his Southampton side comfortably dispose of Sheffield Wednesday, after the rude awakening of a Wednesday equaliser, against the run of play, midway through the second half. Until then they had sat back on an early lead given them by Kevin Davies and were looking complacent before Andy Booth, one of the few experienced players in Paul Jewell's young line-up, equalised with a header in the 66th minute. The introduction of Joe Tessem as a late substitute after a week in Norway following the death of his father made a difference. Tessem introduced much-needed urgency with some powerful runs down the right. Booth, surrounded by team-mates after his header had gone in off a post, was a lonely figure 13 minutes later when he inexplicably handled a free-kick from Wayne Bridge. Jason Dodd stepped up to score with the penalty. James Beattie headed a soft third goal in the second minute of injury time from a Tessem cross to make the scoreline a slightly unfair reflection of the match but there was no doubt Southampton deserved their place in the fifth round. Hoddle was cautious in his assessment but feels that his team have the capability to reach the final as the crowning achievement of his first year in charge at the Dell. He said: 'The Cup is not won by the best team or the most consistent. In my experience it is won by the teams who are lucky on the day and get all the right draws at home. So far we have had two matches against lower division opposition and let us hope it continues.' Sheffield Wednesday's manager, Paul Jewell, was disappointed at Booth's needless handball. 'No complaints because it was an obvious penalty,' he said, adding: 'At 1-1 it was anybody's game but once we had equalised it was almost as if we were frightened to take advantage. 'Booth put his hand up afterwards about the penalty and I wish he'd kept it down during the game.' Davies put Southampton ahead in the ninth minute after his first shot had been blocked by Kevin Pressman, a goal that gave Sheffield United fan Davies more pleasure than most against the old enemy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
