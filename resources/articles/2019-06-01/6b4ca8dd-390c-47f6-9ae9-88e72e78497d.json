The figures are substantially higher than previously thought. Data published in 2016 suggested one in 16 people in conflict zones had mental health problems. But the WHO says its figures are more robust because they are based on 129 studies, of which 45 have not been included in estimates before. The WHO\u2019s paper, published in the Lancet medical journal, says 22% of people living in conflict areas have depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Women are more likely to be affected than men and the burden rises with age. In about 9% of the population, the mental disorder is moderate to severe. In 13%, it is mild. \u201cAlthough the clinical significance of mild mental disorders in emergencies can be contested, the clinical needs of people with severe mental disorders are too often neglected,\u201d says the paper, which calls for more resources to be directed into mental healthcare in conflict zones. \u201cMental healthcare must be prioritised in countries affected by conflict, not least for the well-established links between mental health, functioning and country development.\u201d Armed conflicts reached an all-time high in 2016 \u2013 53 in 37 countries, says the paper. About 12% of the world\u2019s population were living in a conflict zone and 69 million people were forcibly displaced by violence \u2013 the highest number since the second world war. There are major humanitarian crises brought about by conflict in Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Fiona Charlson of the University of Queensland, Australia, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in the US, who was the lead author of the study, said: \u201cI am confident that our study provides the most accurate estimates available today of the prevalence of mental health conditions in areas of conflict. \u201cEstimates from previous studies have been inconsistent, with some finding inconceivably low or high rates.\u201d There are limitations, the authors acknowledged, because the data is not easy to collect. For instance, there was insufficient evidence on the burden of psychosis, and alcohol disorders were not included. Dr Mark van Ommeren of the WHO\u2019s department of mental health and substance abuse, who was also one of the authors, said there were opportunities after conflicts to do more for people. \u201cDespite their tragic consequences, when the political will exists, emergencies can be catalysts for building quality, sustainable mental health services that continue to help people in the long term,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
