Adrian Cheok received a Queen\u2019s Birthday honour earlier this month for \u201csignificant services to international education\u201d. His award is facing a formal challenge on the basis of his past behaviour on social media. In what could be one of his final acts as a senator before his term officially expires on Sunday, Anning asked Australia\u2019s head of state and her representatives to not bow to pressure from \u201cactivists and academics\u201d. He insisted the award has been bestowed on a \u201cgreatly deserving\u201d and \u201cdistinguished scientist\u201d. \u201cHe is, in fact, one of the most inspirational people I have ever met,\u201d the far-right politician wrote in the letter to the Queen on his parliamentary letterhead. At the May federal election, Cheok attracted 868 votes in the lower=house seat of Boothby in South Australia running for Fraser Anning\u2019s Conservative National party. Cheok and Anning also say they are setting up a graduate school that will teach classes on \u201cTrumpism\u201d and \u201cBannonism\u201d. Anning was censured and condemned roundly by the Senate earlier this year for his \u201cinflammatory and divisive\u201d comments on the Christchurch massacre. In the correspondence to the Queen and governor general, Anning claims the push to strip Cheok of the honour is punishment for his political beliefs. \u201cI implore Your Majesty not to allow Your Majesty\u2019s authority to be used as a tool to achieve the political goals of an intolerant and powerful sector of our society,\u201d Anning wrote. Anning warned stripping Cheok of his honour would \u201copen a Pandora\u2019s box of potentially devastating, unintended consequences of a magnitude we can not predict\u201d. He signed off the letter to the Queen: \u201cYour Majesty\u2019s humble and obedient servant\u201d. The Queensland senator also published an article on the blog of the late controversial cartoonist Larry Pickering, defending Cheok\u2019s credentials and criticising media coverage of Cheok\u2019s award, including Guardian Australia\u2019s reporting. \u201cThe gutter press have now smeared Adrian as Robot Sex Man, and are writing hit piece after hit piece, trying to bring him down, and silence him,\u201d Anning wrote. Cheok is listed on the organising committee of a love and sex with robots international congress to be held in Brussels next week. Cheok has previously insisted he is a worthy winner of an Order of Australia award. \u201cI was awarded an Order of Australia based on my work as a computer scientist and electrical engineer who has made world-pioneering inventions in augmented and virtual reality, AI and robotics,\u201d Cheok told Guardian Australia last week. \u201cWith the academic h-index of 45 I am ranked in the top 0.05% of all computer scientists in the world and leading in Australia.\u201d (The h-index measures the productivity and citation impact of an academic\u2019s publications). He dismissed suggestions his award might be challenged. \u201cI expect nothing will happen because this is about creating a perception and getting an emotional public reaction rather than dealing in precise facts,\u201d he said. The Digital Games Research Association Australia chapter president, Brendan Keogh, said last week he intends to challenge Cheok\u2019s award because of his conduct on social media. \u201cHe\u2019s not a worthy recipient due to his track record of abusive behaviour towards other academics in his field,\u201d he said. Keogh cited the incident in 2017 where conference organisers issued a formal apology after Cheok made personal attacks on Twitter against academics who had raised ethical concerns about his research. Cheok responded to Guardian Australia\u2019s recent coverage by calling the journalist \u201cMarxist gutter trash\u201d and a \u201ccommunist Hyenna (sic)\u201d on Twitter. There were 1,374 nominations for the Queen\u2019s birthday awards and 993 were handed out in 2019. In 2015 there were 748 nominations and 519 awards. Federal Labor has flagged it will grill the office of the governor general about the due diligence process, at upcoming Senate estimates hearings, following a huge boost in the numbers of nominations in the past five years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
