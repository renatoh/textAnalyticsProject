Following United\u2019s goalless draw at Liverpool Mourinho and his side were viewed as having adopted negative tactics, yet they are second in the Premier League after eight matches, head their Champions League group with maximum points and are unbeaten in all competitions. Asked if the sides he manages attract a greater level of criticism, Mourinho said: \u201cIt\u2019s my fault, because people are used to my teams getting good results and winning titles. Other people have more time than I have [to criticise]. Other people have different standards than I have and that\u2019s not a problem for me at all. We are going to lose matches, that\u2019s obvious, and I can imagine we are going to have even more criticism than we have now. But honestly, that is no problem.\u201d During his 17-year managerial career the Portuguese has claimed eight championships in four different competitions \u2013 La Liga, Serie A, Primeira Liga and England\u2019s top flight. Mourinho has also claimed two Champions Leagues, the Europa League and its predecessor, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup, four League Cups, plus the domestic cup competitions of Italy, Portugal and Spain once. Asked if jealousy may be part of the reason for the criticism, the 54-year-old, whose side face Huddersfield on Saturday, said: \u201cI don\u2019t care about what it is. I simply don\u2019t care. No, it\u2019s not a motivation. It doesn\u2019t change my mind or my stability. We work hard, we try to do the best we can and get the best possible results. In relation to the last match, speaking about the Champions League [1-0 win at Benfica] I would like to know \u2013 because I don\u2019t know \u2013 when United last won two consecutive matches away. I would like to know the last time United won nine points from three matches in the Champions League. We are doing OK.\u201d Mourinho\u2019s team have conceded only two Premier League goals, the division\u2019s lowest, and one in the Champions League. Despite the negative perception of United, he will continue to deploy a bespoke strategy to gain results in particular games. \u201cIf a team defends badly, concedes five goals but attacks phenomenally well and scores six, then that\u2019s absolutely beautiful and amazing,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI know my team cannot score four, five or six every match. I know that, especially with a certain profile of matches, it is difficult for us to score a lot of goals. We have to try to find balances and I\u2019m really happy with what the team is doing. Critics, critics \u2013 no problem.\u201d After the midweek victory at Benfica, Mourinho criticised managers who use injuries as an excuse. This irritated Chelsea\u2019s Antonio Conte, who believed he was the person being targeted. But Mourinho said: \u201cI don\u2019t speak about him. I don\u2019t know why he speaks about me. Maybe it\u2019s not his fault \u2013 maybe it\u2019s the journalists\u2019 fault when probably they\u2019ve passed him a wrong message. I moan about the fixtures, moan about no time to rest. I moan about why I don\u2019t understand why we play Saturday after Wednesday when we should play Sunday. I moan about this all the time but not about injuries. When managers say I moan about the fixtures then they are right, but nobody can say I moan about injuries because I always try to speak about opportunities for other players.\u201d Mourinho expects Zlatan Ibrahimovic to return in December but he still does not know when Paul Pogba will recover from a hamstring injury. \u201cIf you ask if he can play next week against Tottenham then I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, before being asked why Pogba is being treated in Florida. \u201cYou will have to ask Dr McNally [the head of the medical department]. He is responsible for that. I\u2019m in control of the players who are available. I\u2019m not happy or unhappy [about Pogba] \u2013 it\u2019s not my responsibility.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
