The Vermont senator stopped campaigning at the beginning of October after experiencing chest pains. It was found that he had had a heart attack and was treated for an artery blockage, his campaign said when he was released from hospital. At 78, Sanders is the oldest major presidential candidate. If elected, he will be the oldest president inaugurated. Asked in Tuesday\u2019s debate how he would \u201creassure Democratic voters that you\u2019re up to the stress of the presidency\u201d, he plugged the New York event. \u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is how I think I can reassure the American people.\u201d On Saturday, Sanders strolled on stage to Back in Black by AC/DC. \u201cLet me take this opportunity,\u201d he said, \u201cto thank the many people across this nation who in my time of illness sent me and my family their prayers, their well-wishes and their love. It has meant the world to [my wife Jane] and me, and I thank all of you so very much.\u201d He was, he said, happy to report that he is \u201cmore than ever ready to carry out with you the epic struggle that we face today\u201d. \u201cThere is no question that I and my family have faced adversity over these last few weeks,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe untold story is that people everywhere in this country, in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, are facing their own adversities.\u201d Sanders then launched into policy proposals on education, climate change and healthcare. His speech lasted almost an hour. Though Sanders trails the former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren in most polls, he is beating them in fundraising. From July to September, Sanders raised $25.3m, edging out Warren\u2019s $24.6m and Biden\u2019s $15.2m. There was no shortage of support in Queensbridge Park. Sanders said the campaign got a permit for 20,000 and had to turn people away. The security company handling the event reportedly said more than 25,000 were there. One supporter stood out. \u201cHoly cow!\u201d said Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, New York City?\u201d The 30-year-old congresswoman and progressive star gave Sanders a surprise endorsement this week. Her district is less than a mile from Long Island City, where Sanders set his stage. They were joined by New York politicians, the director and writer Michael Moore, and Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, the mayor of San Juan. Before she became a celebrity in her own right, Ocasio-Cortez was an organizer for Sanders. Some founders of Justice Democrats, the political action committee that helped organize her campaign, are former Sanders staffers. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that the only reason I had any hope in launching a long-shot campaign for Congress is because Bernie Sanders proved that you can run a grassroots campaign in an America where we almost thought it wasn\u2019t possible,\u201d she said. Ocasio-Cortez spoke about her upbringing in a working-class family, her mother born in Puerto Rico and her father in the South Bronx. When she was born, she said, her parents had a one-bedroom apartment with a mattress on the floor and a crib on the closet. \u201cThat\u2019s how we started our American dream,\u201d she said. Ocasio-Cortez said Sanders\u2019 support for access to healthcare and housing directly benefited her family. \u201cWhen you rewind on that story, when I was a baby, my family relied on Planned Parenthood for pre-natal care. Then, Bernie Sanders fought for me. When the federal government decided to discriminate and abandon my queer family and friends, Bernie Sanders was putting his career on the line for us.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez reflected on her first nine months in Congress. \u201cEvery trick in the book, psychological and otherwise, is used to get us to abandon the working class,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has been in that experience \u2026 that I have grown to appreciate the enormous consistent, non-stop advocacy of Senator Bernie Sanders.\u201d Sanders thanked Ocasio-Cortez and said: \u201cIt is hard to believe the degree to which she has transformed politics in America. \u201cI am so delighted that Alexandria is part of our campaign, and I look forward to traveling with her all over this country,\u201d he added. Among the fans, Ron Widelec, 38, a teacher from Westchester county, proudly sported a hoodie from 2016. \u201cHe looked great at the debate, so any concerns I had are gone,\u201d he said. \u201cI invite any of the candidates to try to keep up with him.\u201d Julia Camacchio, 21, a student based in Middlebury, Vermont, said she was initially on the fence between Sanders and Warren but was persuaded when Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, another member of the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d, endorsed Sanders. \u201cTo see that added extra support for me really solidified my vote,\u201d she said. Multiple supporters suggested Sanders\u2019 health problems, while concerning, were hyped by the media. \u201cEvery time he\u2019s mentioned now, [the media has] to mention the word \u2018heart attack\u2019 with his name,\u201d Widelec said. \u201cI think that is a deliberative effort to minimize him.\u201d Al Merenda, 60, from Newburgh, New York, who was accompanied by his 10-year-old son, said that he had two stents inserted in his heart about 10 years ago: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything, and you\u2019re good to go for another 20 years. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. He\u2019s more than fine. Even if he wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s still a better pick. Even if something happens, you still want him in office.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2019 to clarify the details of Sanders\u2019 health issues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
