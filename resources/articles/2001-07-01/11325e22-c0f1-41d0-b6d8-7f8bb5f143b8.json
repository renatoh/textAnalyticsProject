It came when an overzealous official at the theme park hosting the opening stage in the German town of Rust would not let Armstrong bring his bike into the building where the winner's press conference was being held. The Texan is not noted for his patience and stalked off. That, however, was as tough as it got for the double winner of the Tour de France in the fourth-toughest stage race in cycling, which ended in Lausanne on Thursday. Armstrong did not look extended in the two mountain legs, and was crushing in his superiority in the race's two time-trial stages, the second of which, on Tuesday, scaled the 19-mile climb to the Alpine ski resort of Crans Montana. This is ominous: Armstrong's main purpose in choosing the Tour of Switzerland was to use Crans Montana as a dress rehearsal for the afternoon of 18 July, when the Tour de France includes its first mountain time trial since 1996, between Grenoble and the Chamrousse ski station. Such stages are usually key, combining as they do the Tour's most two unforgiving disciplines. From 'visualisation' for the big event, this turned into a clear statement: the next man was over a minute and a half behind - a massive margin - and this was the Italian Gilberto Simoni, who is at his best having just won his home Tour. Armstrong, however, hopes there is better to come. 'I would be disappointed if we had seen the best of me here,' he said. 'The important thing is to be good in the next month.' Barring last-minute hiccups, Armstrong will climb the start ramp in Dunkirk for Saturday's five-mile time trial with an impregnable aura that can only be compared to the five-time winner Miguel Indurain's. It is easy to forget that it is a mere three years since he made his comeback from testicular cancer. To add to the impression that everything is currently going Armstrong's way as he prepares to join seven men who have won three Tours, and the four who have won three in a row, the Texan's wife, Kristin, announced recently that she is expecting twins following successful IVF treatment. Armstrong, who banked sperm before his cancer treatment, will treat this as a bigger victory than either of his Tours. There is even a break in the one cloud that still hangs over Armstrong, the investigation launched last November by the Paris judge Sophie Helene Chateau into his United States Postal Service team for alleged infractions of the law on use and provision of banned drugs at sports events. On Thursday, as he was on the final stage of the Tour of Switzerland, Judge Chateau's office announced that 'in the context of the inquiry, no measures are likely to be taken against the team's riders during the 2001 Tour'. The investigation followed an anonymous denunciation of Armstrong's team after a television crew filmed helpers driving 100 miles away from the team hotel at last year's Tour to dump binbags containing a large quantity of syringes and medical detritus in a motorway service area. Armstrong has not been able to offer an explanation for this, beyond protesting his innocence. On Thursday, however, the prosecutor's office stated that the bin bags contained nothing that broke the law. Judge Chateau added that the results of tests on urine and blood samples, taken during last year's race from Armstrong and his team, would not be known for 'at least a month', making it unlikely that there would be dramatic revelations during the race. Armstrong's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said he was 'delighted that the court has indicated that the Tour will be permitted to go ahead peacefully' and that he was 'particularly satisfied' by the news that 'the rumours which have grown about the US Postal teams dustbins were without foundation'. The controversy will have its effect, however. The race organiser Jean-Marie Leblanc was still outraged by the team's actions when The Observer spoke to him recently, and revealed that he had made his feelings known to the USPS team. He is not the only man angered over the affair. Armstrong has raced just twice in France this year, and his first appearance, at the Circuit de la Sarthe stage race in April, was preceded by an aggressive press conference. He expressed his anger over the length of time taken by the inquiry team and asserted that his urine samples were negative - although Judge Chateau has countered that the tests are not complete. History shows that Armstrong is a rider who needs enemies, real or imagined. In 1999 he was aiming his ire at the teams who did not believe he could return from cancer, in 2000 at the French press, who had expressed doubts about the purity of his victory the previous year. This year, the target is easy to guess, and his anger will fire him up - more, probably, than opponents such as Jan Ullrich will - throughout the next four weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
