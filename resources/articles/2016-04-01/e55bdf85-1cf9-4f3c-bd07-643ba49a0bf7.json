The time when the first tabloids were investigating Whittingdale in 2013, was shortly after Leveson inquiry into press standards concluded in end of 2012. The Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), the revamped industry-backed regulator, came into force in September 2014 after the newspaper groups rejected attempts to create a royal charter-backed regulator. Hugh Tomlinson QC, described as \u201cgo-to media silk\u201d for claimants against newspapers, told the Guardian that he was surprised about the tabloid reticence over pictures of the culture secretary and a dominatrix even in the post-Leveson environment. \u201cThe question is really why they didn\u2019t [run the story],\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThey obviously thought it was worth investigating.\u201d Charlotte Harris, another seasoned media lawyer, said she would object if revelations about person\u2019s private life were being used to try to depose them. \u201cI would hate for someone to be ruined just because the newspapers find out something potentially embarrassing,\u201d she said. She was one of a number of lawyers to point out the power of editors to self-censor. \u201cWhen it comes down to it, editors decide who it is they are going to attack,\u201d she added. Some have suggested that the fact that four newspapers investigated Whittingdale\u2019s personal life between 2013 and 2015 and did not produce a story amounted to a conspiracy of silence. Media lawyer Mark Stephens, a senior member at law firm Howard Kennedy, said: \u201cI think this idea that the media were completely in on this and decided to tuck the story away for later, it doesn\u2019t really stand scrutiny.\u201d However, in recent months, the pressures on the newspaper industry has receded with delays in both the second part of the Leveson inquiry and the highly controversial imposition of costs on the industry. \u201cOver the past year there\u2019s more or less been a return to the old fashioned kiss and tell,\u201d says Tomlinson. \u201cThe position is now very similar to the position before Leveson. There were basically no privacy injunctions against the media for about three years.\u201d Over the past six months, all that has changed. A media lawyer, who said he was too busy seeking injunctions against newspapers to want to be named, said: \u201cSex is back would be the tabloid summary.\u201d Unless perhaps, it involves sex with a cabinet minister."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
