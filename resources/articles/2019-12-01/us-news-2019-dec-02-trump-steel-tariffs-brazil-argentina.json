In a surprise move, Trump accused the two countries of devaluing their currencies and hurting US farmers. All the US stock markets fell on fears of rising trade tensions. \u201cBrazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies. which is not good for our farmers,\u201d Trump said in a tweet. The announcement came as a symbolic slap in the face for Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro, who has positioned himself as Trump\u2019s closest ally in the Americas. Bolsonaro told Brazil\u2019s R\u00e1dio Itatiaia: \u201cI\u2019m going to call him so that he doesn\u2019t penalize us \u2026 Our economy basically comes from commodities, it\u2019s what we\u2019ve got. I hope that he understands and that he doesn\u2019t penalize us with this, and I\u2019m almost certain he\u2019ll listen to us.\u201d Brazil\u2019s main steel industry body, Instituto A\u00e7o Brasil, said that it was \u201cperplexed\u201d by the decision and argued that the move would hurt US businesses who use Brazilian steel. Argentina\u2019s production minister, Dante Sica, called Trump\u2019s announcement \u201cunexpected\u201d and said he was seeking talks with US officials. The US\u2019s long-running trade war with China has benefited Argentina and Brazil as China has bought more agricultural goods from the Latin American countries in retaliation. But both countries are struggling economically. Brazil\u2019s currency, the real, hit a record low last week and unemployment is above 10%. In Argentina inflation is above 50% and a third of the population live in poverty. The news came after a week in which it appeared that the White House was tempering its long-running trade disputes in the lead-up to next year\u2019s election. Trump administration officials had hoped to sign a \u201cphase one\u201d deal with Beijing, removing some tariffs, before 15 December, when the US is set to impose an additional 15% tariff on about $156bn of Chinese products. The commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, told Fox Business on Monday that the new tariffs were still on the table. \u201cIf nothing happens between now and then, the president has made quite clear he\u2019ll put the tariffs in,\u201d he said. In recent weeks the administration has also appeared closer to a deal with Democrats to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement, now known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. But the potential agreements are at the mercy of Trump\u2019s mercurial negotiating style."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
