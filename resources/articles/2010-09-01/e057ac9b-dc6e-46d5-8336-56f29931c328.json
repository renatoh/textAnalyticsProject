Despite playing down his own candidacy, Harry Redknapp did concede that he would not be able to turn down the job if it were offered while Steve Bruce made it clear that he would happily accept the baton. \"Of course I would like to manage England,\" said Sunderland's manager. \"I rarely blow my own trumpet, I don't promote myself but I'd have a go, why not? It must be the time of your life to manage your country, even though you know what's going to go with it. It must be wonderful, absolutely wonderful. \"I would have thought Harry Redknapp must be the main contender but there's not many of us Englishmen managing in the Premier League, so why not?\" Asked if the post would be worth the inevitable hassle and scrutiny that accompanies it, Bruce's reply was unequivocal. \"To be England manager, it would be 100% worth it,\" he said. \"You need a thick skin of course, but then you need one of those to work up here in the north-east. \"If you're going to do something in life you've got to try to get to the top, that's what I've always tried to do. I've striven for whatever I've done, so, if that's the highest I can go, I've got to aim for it.\" The former Sheffield United, Huddersfield, Crystal Palace, Birmingham and Wigan manager accepts there are no guarantees. \"I think it's all about timing,\" Bruce acknowledged. \"It's about what you do over the next 18 months. There might be a new kid on the block by then. It's about whether your stock's good at the time.\" When Steve McClaren managed Middlesbrough he alienated Teesside fans by failing to disguise his burning ambition to coach his country but Bruce believes their Sunderland counterparts will view the situation more generously. \"This is a terrific job, a fantastic job,\" said the 49-year-old. \"But I think if I got offered England or, was in the frame, it would mean I'd done a very, very good job here. I think most of our supporters would be happy with that.\" When it came to discussing his own ambitions to swap Tottenham for England, Redknapp came over a little coy. Asked if he would turn the chance to succeed Capello down, he replied. \"No, but I don't want to start saying I want the England job, because I don't. It's not something that I push myself for. I think I think there's enough lads out there, given the opportunity, to do a great job. \"There's a lot of good English managers out there who never get the opportunity to manage at a higher level, who would be just as good and just as clever given the chance. I really believe that.\" Indeed, Redknapp envisages multiple contenders. \"It ain't a bed of roses, that's for sure,\" he said. \"But people will always take it because, if you're English, it's the pinnacle of your career if you're in management. You've got to take the job if you get offered it.\" Already 63, Tottenham's manager hinted that the vacancy's timing was, nonetheless, possibly wrong for him. \"I will probably be too old,\" said Redknapp. \"If Capello is too old I will be too old.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
