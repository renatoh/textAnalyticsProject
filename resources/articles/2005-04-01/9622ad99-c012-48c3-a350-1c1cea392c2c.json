A good hair protector pre-swim will save you from the ritual humiliation that is a swimming cap, and for this reason K\u00e9rastase's product receives the highest marks from the swimming fraternity. Honours must also go to the Joico range, which does a reasonable job of intimidating chlorine; and you have to love the sturdy Boots product - a three-in-one job will never be luxe, but at least it will minimise time spent in a scuzzy shower. More salubrious surroundings deserve a natural-smelling shower gel, and a generous helping of Bliss's drenching moisturiser will stop fishy scales from growing.
