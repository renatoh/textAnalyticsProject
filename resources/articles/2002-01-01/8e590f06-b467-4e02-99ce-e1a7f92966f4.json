This eventually drives him around the bend, to the point that he is willing to contemplate murder, suicide or both. Since going to bed with Penelope Cruz and waking up with Cameron Diaz - or vice versa - is a problem most men could handle with no problem at all, it is fair to say that Crowe has not built enormous sympathy for his protagonist. Vanilla Sky is a pretentious, interminable remake of Alejandro Amenabar's pretentious, interminable 1997 film Open Your Eyes, which also starred the sparrow-like but then unknown Cruz. Why Crowe agreed to pilot this handpicked Cruise project is a mystery; apparently he really wanted to work with the star. A talented, respected screenwriter and a competent director best known for the charming, if schmaltzy Jerry Maguire, and the charming, if schmaltzy Almost Famous, Crowe does not seem like the sort of person who would deliberately become ensnared in a non-commercial, self-consciously arty mess like Vanilla Sky. This is clearly a desperate attempt to be taken more seriously, for the film is nothing if not an earnest attempt to deal with the big questions. It is nothing if not a big bomb. Vanilla Sky concerns a man who has trouble sleeping, and even when he is not sleeping he cannot be sure he is awake. But whether sleeping or not, he certainly has amazing teeth. Whether flashing his headlight smile at Cruz, Diaz or both of them simultaneously, Cruise spends so much time smiling in the early part of the film that you can't wait for something really bad to happen to him so that he'll just shut his damned mouth. It's as if he were engaged in an all-out war with Julia Roberts to see who lands that coveted job as official spokesperson for the American Dental Association. As the film begins, Cruise has inherited a huge publishing empire from his father, a ruthless billionaire who died when Tom was quite young. Scorned as a shallow playboy by his board of directors, Cruise is convinced that these \"Seven Dwarves\" are plotting a coup. This does not prevent him from bedding Diaz every chance he gets, or from filching the sparrow-like Cruz from his best friend, a fledgling novelist played by Jason Lee. Crowe would have us believe that Cruz is the only genuine person Cruise has ever met, the only one that is not after his money, and, apparently, the only woman he has never slept with. But remember: this could all be a dream. Diaz, who seems to be some sort of artiste or model, does not take kindly to Cruise's dalliance with the sparrow-like Cruz. She entices him into her car, then takes him on a wild ride, seeking to read him the riot act. But disaster ensues. Now she is probably dead. And Cruise's face is horribly disfigured. And the sparrow-like Cruz no longer wants to date him. But remember: this could all be a dream. The movie does not become any more lucid as it trudges towards its enigmatic conclusion. Cruise is accused of murdering either Diaz or Cruz, but we do not know which, because the police refuse to divulge whether the victim was sparrow-like. A compassionate psychiatrist played by Kurt Russell tries to unlock the secret to Cruise's delusions, but he is of little help because he himself may be an illusion. The car crash and subsequent murder may stem from the machinations of the Seven Dwarves but then again it may all be a dream. For all I know, this review of Vanilla Sky may all be a dream. If it is, I sure hope it's a dream where I get paid 70,000 quid for writing it. The film is not without its merits, most notably Crowe's clever dialogue. When Cruise first dons a \"facial prosthetic\" - also known as an \"aesthetic regenerative shield\" - to conceal his disgured face, he hollers out, \"That's great. This completely takes care of Halloween.\" Later someone says: \"You do not invite happiness in without a full body search.\" I am not sure what this means, but it sounds like good advice, especially if you live in Greenwich Village. Equally entertaining is the scene where Diaz snaps, \"When you sleep with someone, your body makes a promise, even if you don't.\" I, for one, hope that this does not apply to blow jobs. Diaz addresses this very issue when she adds, \"I swallowed your cum. That means something.\" Actually, it doesn't. Ask Bill Clinton. People who don't care for Tom Cruise claim that he never takes risks, that he always plays the same part. This is not true. From Born On The Fourth Of July to Interview With The Vampire to Eyes Wide Shut to Magnolia, Cruise has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to roll the dice and \"stretch\". Here, as in Far And Away and Cocktail, he comes up short. But the fault lies less in his acting - it is a bit over-the-top in places as Cruise mounts his Oscar campaign - than in the film's very conception. At no point does Crowe explain to us why we should care about this self-involved plutocrat or his hideous entourage. The only people in the film who are vaguely likable are the stolid Kurt Rusell and the sparrow-like Penelope Cruz. Uh-oh. With Vanilla Sky, Cruz adds to her impressive list of duds. Adorable in Woman On Top, Cruz has continued to be adorable, but has gone down with the ship in such high-profile disasters as All The Pretty Horses and Captain Corelli's Mandolin. Despite Hollywood's best efforts to turn the sultry gamine into the next Jennifer Lopez, she is starting to look more like the next Salma Hayek, the next Maria Conchita Alonzo or the next-to-last Antonio Banderas. Proving that one sparrow does not make a spring. \u00b7 Vanilla Sky is out on Friday"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
