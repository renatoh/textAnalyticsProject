The players are low on confidence, I think you can see that. We had a good reaction at the start of the second half but we need to start games likes that. That\u2019s the biggest disappointment I have ... We\u2019re in a difficult situation, we\u2019ve lost a lot of games and confidence has gone down. You could see that at the start, with low energy... A lot of things to think about.\u201d Asked whether players are aware of their responsibility for improving performances, he replies: \u201cPlayers do as good as they can. They are a bit low on confidence.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely delighted. It\u2019s a wonderful feeling. We had three tough games with no pints so it\u2019s nice to bounce back at a place like this. I thought we did really well in the first half ... pressed well and defended well, kept the ball when we had to and tried to create things. Then there was a response [from Arsenal] and we had to dig in... It gives us a lot of belief.\u201d \u201cI thought Aaron Mooy was fantastic all game. He was so unselfish with his play and then added that little bit of quality at the end [the cross for Maupay\u2019s decisive goal]. All the player were amazing, real courage and real bravery on the ball.\u201d Lewis Dunk: \u201cWe made it tough for ourselves after the first half in which ew were excellent ... but we showed great character to come back and win the game.\u201d Maupay: \u201cLewis said before the game we can\u2019t say \u2018we played well but didn\u2019t get the win\u2019. We needed to win today.\u201d Dunk: \u201cWe were expecting a reaction. [Arsenal] showed at the start of the second half what a side they cane be. We had to grind out the win.\u201d Nick Ames was at the Emirates. I haven\u2019t had a chance to read his report yet but the Probability Indicator says there\u2019s a 99% chance it\u2019s terrific. Have a gander here: Lee Dixon, referring to how easily Brighton found space all over the pitch, but especially in midfield: \u201cIt\u2019s fine to make mistakes, but if you keep making the same mistakes .... There are players out there doing exactly the same thing now that they were doing at the end of last season. The players have got to take responsibility.\u201d Alan Pardew, speaking on Amazon, has it right. \u201cBrighton totally deserved it .... it all came down to basics. If you don\u2019t have pressure on the ball you look disjointed and that was Arsenal. Brighton did all the basics right.\u201d \u201cOnly just noticed that Aaron Mooy looks like a young Freddie Ljungberg,\u201d parps Jim Greenan. \u201cThis is becoming a Stephen King novel.\u201d Arsenal extend their winless run to nine matches, as Brighton make off with an impressive victory. Graham Potter\u2019s team dominated the first half and went in at the break with a lead thanks to Adam Webster. Freddie Ljungberg inspired an improvement from Arsenal in the second half and they deservedly equalised through Alexander Lacazette. But that was as good as it got for the generally ragged hosts, who fell to an excellent late winning goal by Neal Maupay. Brighton were the better, more accomplished side overall and deserve their win. 90+3 min: Trossard pounces on a mistake by Xhaka and dodges his way towards the Arsenal box. He cuts back on to his left foot and then blems a shot over the bar. That would have sealed it! 90+1 min: There will be at least three more minutes of stoppage time. Our makeshift Probability Indicator - mad from some staples and chewing gum - puts Brighton\u2019s chances of victory at 96.7%. 90 min: P\u00e9p\u00e9 curls a low freekick around the wall and wide of the far post. It must have taken a slight nick of the wall, actually, because a corner has been awarded. Nowt comes of it. 89 min: Freekick to Arsenal about 20 yards out, a little to the right of the D, after Trossard needlessly fouls P\u00e9p\u00e9... will he be made to regret that? Brighton substitution: Duffy on, Alzate off. That\u2019s a pretty strong declaration of intent. 86 min: Tierney\u2019s provides a wonderful cross from the left. Martinelli meets it with a very good header towards the bottom corner, but Ryan manages sto pushes it behind for a corner. That was almost a convincing cover version of Brighton\u2019s second goal. 84 min: Bellerin scampers down the right and sends a token cross into the box. Easy pickings for Ryan. 82 min: P\u00e9p\u00e9 forces Ryan into a moderate save with a reasonable effort from the right. 80 min: That really was an exquisitely crafted goal. Mooy outfoxed Bellerin on the left by shifting niftily on to his right foot to deliver an ideal cross. And then Maupay, having found space with some deft movement away from Arsenal\u2019s defenders, glanced a header into the corner beyond the reach of Leno. All very accomplished, in the image of their overall performance here. A superbly directed header from 10 yards after a lovely cross from the left by Mooy! Brighton substitution: Trossard on, Gross off. 79 min: Mooy finds Maupay with a canny disguised pass. David Luiz makes an important block. Arsenal substitution: Martinelli on, Lacazette off. 76 min:Delightful play by Propper and Alzate to work the latter into a prime crossing position. But then Alzate tries one trick too many and confuses himself, allowing the ball to dribble out of play. Brighton substitution: Montoya on, Connolly off. That suggest a change of tack from Potter. 74 min: This match is in the balance. Arsenal are looking the more sprightly but Brighton still have the ability to create chances. There\u2019s no telling how this is going to play out. Anyone know where a man could get a good Probability Indicator? Arsenal substitution: Tierney on, Kolasinac off. I believe that change was already in the pipeline before Koalsinac got that knock - he doesn\u2019t appear to be seriously injured. 71 min: Another burst forward by Kolasinac ends with him being caught late by Alzate, who\u2019s lucky to avoid a booking. 69 min: Lacazette retrieves a hopeful pass chucked into the channel by Sokratis. He looks up and presents the ball to Ozil about 25 yards out. Ozil goes for the first time shot but doesn\u2019t catch it properly. 68 min: David Luiz booked for taking out Connolly to abort a counter-attack. 67 min: Dunk goofs mid-way inside the Arsenal half and has the ball ripped off him. P\u00e9p\u00e9 hurtles forward and then nips a nice ball through to Aubameyang, whose shot on the run is deflected out for a corner. 64 min: The goal is ruled out, correctly. 63 min: GOAL? Ozil floats in a freekick from the right and David Luiz is free to sidefoot a volley in from 15 yards! But he was a couple of yards offside so expect VAR to overrule it .... eventually. 62 min: Lovey dainty cross from the right by Alzate after a flowing move. Mooy leaps above Bellerin to get a good downward header in from eight yards. Leno pushes it out for a corner! 61 min: Brighton take the corner short, then Xhaka clears Mooy\u2019s cross. Gross cops a booking for deliberately handling the ball to curtail a counter-attack. 60 min: Gross cruises through midfield and slips in Mooy, whose shot from the edge of the area cannons off a defender and goes out for a corner. 58 min: Torreira seems to have injured himself whilst fouling Connolly. 58 min: Kolasinac is getting stuck into Brighton like they\u2019re a pair of knife-wielding car-jackers. Aubameyang narrowly fails to get a touch to his latest cross from the left. 55 min: Superb work by Bellerin down the right, followed by a cracking cross. Webster gets enough of a touch on it ti deviate it away from Aubameyang, who would have had a tap-in. 54 min: Ljungberg evidently located Arsenal\u2019s mojo at half-time because they\u2019ve come out with fresh intensity in this half and have already posed Brighton more problems than they did in the whole of the first period. 52 min: Brighton\u2019s counter-attack. Connolly has Mooy coming in offering support on the left but he doesn\u2019t see him and goes for goal himself. His shot from the edge of the box goes wide off a defender. Ozil\u2019s corner is flicked on at the heat post by Lacazette and it goes in off the far post. Kolasinac jumped but didn\u2019t need to it help it over the line, which is just as well, as he may have been offside. 50 min: P\u00e9p\u00e9 supplies the overlapping Bellerin, whose cross is deflected out for a corner. 49 min: Strong run by P\u00e9p\u00e9 down the right - he\u2019s made a positive impact so far, adding much-needed thrust and urgency to Arsenal\u2019s attack. But his concluding pass this time falls short of Ozil. 47 min:P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s first contribution is a dinky exchange with Ozil, which enables him to win a corner. Ozil\u2019s delivery is cleared by Burn. Arsenal substitution: P\u00e9p\u00e9 on, Willock off. According to Clive Tyldsley, the new comers \u201chas just gone through the most languid warm-up I have ever seen.\u201d \u201cI was listening to one of those learned podcasts we\u2019re always being encouraged to improve ourselves with, and it turns out that Hope hasn\u2019t always had a good press among the philosophers,\u201d lectures Charles Antaki. \u201cApparently there\u2019s some feeling that Zeus arranged that it should remain in Pandora\u2019s box of vices precisely because it was the most pernicious of the lot. Nietzsche didn\u2019t think much of it either. And now legions of Arsenal fans.\u201d Don\u2019t fret, Charles: Pepe is about to come on .... \u201cBooooooooo!\u201d is the familiar verdict from home fans. Their team have been disjointed and slow, the total opposite of Brighton, who have had the majority of possession and been clever and constructive with it. They know what they\u2019re doing, whereas Arsenal have got nothing but spasmodic bluster and glimpses of talent. The Probability Indicator say Brighton are cruising to victory here, Ljungberg isn\u2019t getting this job full-time and the New Manager will have his work cut out. 45 min: Sokratis booked for sliding into to the back of Connolly\u2019s legs near the corner flag. 44 min: Aubameyang sends over another useful cross from the right. It comes to Lacazette, who goes down under a light challenge by Webster. No penalty, reckons the referee. At first look that seems right. 41 min: Connolly collects a nice pass from Mooy but is too slow to feed Maupay. Otherwise Brighton would have surely been in for goal number two. 40 min: Aubameyang leaves Burn for dead down the right and then measures out a fine cross. Lacazette meets it with a header seven yards out ... and Ryan makes an excellent save! Much better from Arsenal! 39 min: Brighton stream forward anew, and Arsenal are lucky that the final ball towards Connolly is overhit. \u201cThe Arsenal back line simply retreats and retreats,\u201d notes Mary Waltz. \u201cDon\u2019t they know how to challenge a onrushing attacker?\u201d In fairness to them, they are getting zero protection from midfield - Brighton are free to run at them in numbers. 37 min: The sound you can hear is either Arsenal fans whingeing or the Amazon Probability Indicator smashing into a million useless pieces on the ground after being chucked out of a window with righteous vigour .... That\u2019s been coming! Brun nods a corner to the edge of the six-yad box, where Connolly took it down and tried to shoot on the swivel. It as taken off his foot by a defender but fell to Webster, who swept it into the net from eight yards! 35 min: David Luiz, spooked by Connolly\u2019s ferocious pressing, donks the ball straight out of play for a Brighton throw-in, then throws his hands up at the lack of options provided by teammates. Arsenal fans\u2019 grumbling is growing louder ... 34 min: Propper canters through midfield and has a pop from 20 yards. Leno makes another save. Arsenal are increasingly nervous and ragged, other than their goalkeeper. 33 min: Maupay lets fly from 25 yards after a quickly taken Brighton freekick. While Arsenal\u2019s defenders dozed, Leno was alert enough to dive to his left and push the ball away. 30 min: Brighton are having the majority of possession and passing with far more confidence and purpose than Arsenal have mustered so far. 28 min: Arsenal work up a storm around the opposing box. Torreira\u2019s miskick from outside the area finds its way to Aubameyang, whose low effort from the right-hand side wobbles wide. \u201cI\u2019ve been an Arsenal follower since 1953, I\u2019m in my hospital bed in Melbourne recovering after a cancer op,\u201d says Ray Brindle. \u201cAre there any signs so far that the Gunners will give me a hope for a reverse in fortunes?\u201d At the moment I\u2019s say Arsenal\u2019s most likely source of a goal is a penalty, because Brighton\u2019s defenders are quick to grab shirts on the rare occasions Arsenal apply pressure in the box. Soonoer or later the ref is going to spot it, you suspect. Get well soon! 26 min: Mooy\u2019s delivery from the left finds Maupay beyond the far post. The Frenchman takes it down and cracks a fierce low shot just wide of the other post from a difficult angle. 25 min: Three players converge on Connolly at the edge of the Arsenal area but the young striker manages to win a corner. \u201cDoes the Amazon Win Probability Indicator work like Duckworth-Lewis in cricket,\u201d wonders Graeme Thorns. \u201cSo that if the floodlights failed, there was a freak flood submerging the pitch or any other way the match is abandoned, then Arsenal would be awarded the win?\u201d Probably not. 24 min: Ebster gets his head to Gross\u2019 outswinging corner. Leno makes another comfortable save. 23 min: Gross bangs the freekick straight into the wall he had been watching get assembled for the past two minutes. 22 min: No quick freekick by Brighton this time, unlike at Anfield .... Arsenal are still setting up their wall 20 min: Connolly goes down in the Arsenal box as he tries to latch on to a clipped pass by Stephens. Bellerin pulled him back and gets a booking. The ref awards a freekick just outside the box.. 18 min: Connolly jinks on the his right foot at the left-hand corner of the Arsenal box and tries to send a curler into the far corner of the net. But it\u2019s too close to Leno, who makes a straightforward save. 15 min: Steady buildup by Brighton, featuring a nice burst by Mooy past Bellerin. But then David Luiz steps in front of Connolly to make a good interception. 13 min: According to Amazon new-fangled \u201cWin probability indicator\u201d, Arsenal have a 53% chance of winning this match based on the play so far. Brighton have just 15% chance. I put it to you that that is 100% bilge. 12 min: Brilliant interplay between Xhaka, Ozil, Aubameyang and Lacazette before the Frenchman forces a good save from Ryan from 10 yards .... but it wouldn\u2019t have counted, as the flag was up for offside. 10 min: Brighton half-clear a corner. The ball is worked to David Luiz at the right-hand corner of the box. He rasps a low ball across the face of goal. Ryan gets down to snaffle it. 9 min: Ozil and Kolasinc combine down the left before the German sends over a cross that Burn feels obliged to head behind for a corner. Ozil delivers that, too, and Lacazette gets a good flick on it at the near post despite a shove from Gross. 7 min: Xhaka heads a Brighton cross away at the near post. 7 min: Brighton have settled into a nice passing rhythm, but Arsenal are working hard without the ball to restrict space. 5 min: Bellerin fires over a low cross from the right. Ozil tries to flick it on artfully. Alzate puts it out for a corner. Ozil\u2019s delivery is wellied clear at the penalty spot by Maupay. 4 min: [...buffering ...] 3 min: Mooy digs out a cross from the left. It\u2019s hoofed clear by Mesut Ozil, of all people. 2 min: Aubameyang, operating wide on the left it seems, gives the ball away with his first touch. Brighton start passing it around methodically ... until they, too, give it away, and Dunk has to make an important interception to stop Arsenal from taking advantage. 1 min: Arsenal v Brighton is go! But only after Lacazette throws a dummy before taking kickoff. Classic Arsenal. The players enter the arena to warm applause. Ljungberg takes his place in the dugout. He\u2019s wearing a big coat zipped up to his neck so I can\u2019t tell you whether he\u2019s got a shirt and tie underneath: sorry, Paul Scholes. In other news, Newcastle have taken the lead at Sheffiled United thanks to Allan Saint-Maxims first goal for the club. Steve Bruce\u2019s Black and White Army are on the march! And here\u2019s thought for the day, from Justin Kavanagh. \u201cHas Arsenal\u2019s negative goal difference got much to do with the presence of the Brazilian enigma who was at the heart of the 7-1 World Cup semi-final heartbreak, do you think? Clearly, he is a fine footballer, and can deliver a wonderful long pass, but I\u2019ve always had a suspicion that he\u2019d be a much better deep midfielder than a centre-half (who can\u2019t seem to keep track of his marker).\u201d Well, yes, a deep midfielder (or a centreback in a three-man defence) and possibly a better one than any of Arsenal\u2019s current crop. The problem goes beyond one player - Arsenal\u2019s is a very unbalanced squad; and conceding is certainly a problem, but that negative difference is also because they\u2019re not scoring anywhere near as many as they should. Burnley and Villa has netted more than them so far this season. Still, I fancy them to nick another 2-2 today (which is why Aubameyang is my fantasy captain again). Here are the thoughts of Kim \u201cNo Relation\u201d Doyle: \u201cWith Freddie and Per at the helm of the Gunners, I expect the return of quick attacking, one or two touch football. The real problem has been in the defensive midfielder position(s) \u2013 with teams attacker through the middle, almost at will. Torreira needs to return to the combative form that he showed in his first several Arsenal starts of last season. Like the classical Hero the Gunners have gone down to the underworld but now will return to the Land of the Living.\u201d Freddie Ljungberg\u2019s hopes of getting the Arsenal gig on a permanent basis have just suffered a blow: Marco Silva is now available. David Luiz has been stating the obvious: \u201cIn modern football everyone has to understand both moments of the game - attacking and defending ... We have to improve this immediately because it\u2019s been a long time since you can see that nobody can score against us.\u201d As for Brighton, Pascal Gross says the keys to them winning today will be \u201cpatience on the ball, be brave on the ball and then use your chances.\u201d Ljungberg has made three changes to the lineup that started at Carrow Road, with Mustafi jilted to enable Sokratis to return. Bellerin comes in at right-back. Still no place for Pepe, though. Arsenal: Leno; Bellerin, Sokratis, David Luiz, Kolasinac; Willock, Xhaka, Torreira; Ozil; Aubameyang, Lacazette Subs: Martinez, Guendouzi, Tierney, Pepe, Martinelli, Nelson, Chambers Brighton: Ryan; Webster, Dunk, Stephens; Alzate, Propper, Mooy, Gross, Burn; Maupay, Connolly Subs: Bissouma, Duffy, Button, Bernardo, Murray, Trossard, Montoya Referee: G Scott Arsenal have two of the best strikers around - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette. Their highest paid player is a creative midfielder. And in the summer they spent a record fee on an exciting forward. So it has taken extraordinary incompetence for them to reach the 14-game mark with a negative goal difference. And that\u2019s just one reason why Unai Emery got the boot. Yes, Arsenal are, in the throes of a crisis. They are desperately seeking a full-time manager and a coherent way of playing. And, er, they are four points and six places above Brighton, who are so happy with their gaffer that they\u2019ve just handed him a six-year contract extension without being asked. The thing is, Graham Potter has given Brighton a sense of direction even if results have yet to live up to the promise shown. He has generated belief. Arsenal, alas, remain a club riddled with doubts, possibly even despair, at least for some. Temporary boss Freddie Ljungberg didn\u2019t do a heck of a lot to change that in his first match in charge even if there were brief spells of encouragement during the draw at Norwich. Let\u2019s see if the visit of Brighton to the Emirates bring any more cheer to Arsenal fans, and justifies the Seagulls\u2019 faith in Potter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
