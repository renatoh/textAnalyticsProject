They have not absorbed as many physical bruises as did those fine, departed warriors, but there has been pain, psychological as well as physical, since they first played as youths nearly 20 years ago and kept punching all the way through their professional careers, with Djokovic ahead in these surely latter stages of the rivalry, 34-10. \u201cThis maybe is one of the biggest matches that we have ever played against each other, so let\u2019s enjoy it,\u201d said the Serb. Murray has won two of his three slams by beating Djokovic in the final but this match is different. It has its recent genesis in Djokovic\u2019s surprise collapse in the early stages at Wimbledon and has been building by the week, as he struggled on and off the court while Murray went on the sort of run every player dreams about: unbeaten now in 24 matches over more than three months and returning in front of his home fans with four titles collected on the spin among eight for the year \u2013 plus the scalp of the man who will look across the net at him around 6pm at the O2 Arena on Sunday. At stake is the world No1 ranking, which the Scot took from the Serb in Paris nearly a fortnight ago. Their almost inevitable collision follows semi-final wins that could hardly have been more different, Murray taking a record three hours and 38 minutes to wear down the serving monster that is Milos Raonic, 5-7, 7-6, 7-6, before Djokovic\u2019s one hour and six minutes stroll to blow away Kei Nishikori 6-1, 6-1. There was very little traffic on Route 66. Much will depend on how the two players recover: Murray\u2019s match was the longest of the week (and in the history of the tournament), while Djokovic\u2019s was the shortest. The Serb was awesome, back to his best, and will be so tough to beat. He said later: \u201cI pretty much executed everything that I tactically planned to do. \u201cI started off very well. That helps when you\u2019re playing against a top player. Kei was obviously a little bit tired, not at his best. My week has been going in the right direction. The last couple of matches have been pretty much flawless and now we\u2019re coming up to the last match of the year, the one everyone wanted. There are two of us on the court, let\u2019s start with that. Let\u2019s enjoy the occasion, be conscious of the great match. I\u2019m honoured to be part of the history with Andy tomorrow. We have known each other many years.\u201d The biggest struggle of the match arrived in the first set when security guards grabbed a spectator who ran on to the court and escorted him from the premises. Djokovic said, \u201cNo, I did not feel threatened. Maybe he just wanted to be noticed.\u201d The second semi-final was a pointed statement \u2013 not necessarily intentional \u2013 as Nishikori engaged in a three hours and 20 minutes game against Murray on Wednesday night, to that point the longest match in the tournament\u2019s history. There was precious little left of the Japanese player against Djokovic, whose confidence and power have blossomed by the day after an uncertain start last Sunday. There are some who still regard him as the world\u2019s best, whatever the slim lead Murray has over him in the rankings. Others closer to the heat of battle see it differently; Raonic for instance. \u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of great things,\u201d the Canadian said of Murray, clearly exhausted after what was one of the most draining spectacles \u2013 for players and spectators alike \u2013 this season. \u201cNothing\u2019s missing in that storyline. \u201cTennis ranking is a game of checks and balances. Who\u2019s going to finish No1 is who does the best that year. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter whether [Murray and Djokovic] played or not. You could take that away from Andy in a way; then you could also say it\u2019s sort of Novak\u2019s responsibility to get to that point because Andy was there every single week. Regardless, Andy\u2019s still the best player in the world of 2016. There\u2019s no question about it.\u201d If Nishikori was totally spent after enduring a Murray mauling, the question remains unanswered about what the winner of the first semi-final can bring to the final. Raonic did not lack for candour about his own physical state. \u201cI\u2019ll probably feel like crap for the next few days,\u201d he said. Murray was more circumspect, not wanting to give Djokovic even a sliver of a psychological advantage, but he could not deny he was spent after a match that demanded as much mental fortitude as physical stamina. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll feel tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously I\u2019m tired just now because it was a really hard match. It wasn\u2019t just that it was physically hard, it was mentally a tough match, too. It was pretty stressful. I was quite far behind in the second set, a set and a break down, managed to turn it round. Then it was back and forth in the third set.\u201d The pressures also bring frustration. Earlier in the week, Djokovic was castigated for hitting a ball into the crowd, risking censure at least, not to mention injury to a spectator. His local media went apoplectic when a British journalist questioned him about it. \u201cYou guys are unbelievable,\u201d he said in an exchange that was pretty feisty. Well, Murray hit a ball into the crowd on Saturdaylast night, off an overhead beam admittedly, but conceded later: \u201cIf you hit balls into crowds, stuff like that, obviously you\u2019re close to getting defaulted. You have to be very, very careful with that. That\u2019s happened to my opponents this week, as well, and they didn\u2019t get warnings for hitting a ball up into the scoreboard. \u201cI think for the players, you just want the consistency there. But, if you\u2019re hitting balls into the crowd or anything like that, you deserve to be warned. It\u2019s up to the umpire, if you hit a ball into the crowd, if it hits someone, whether they default you or not.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
