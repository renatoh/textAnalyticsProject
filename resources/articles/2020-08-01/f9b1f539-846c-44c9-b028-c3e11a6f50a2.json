Speaking after the three killers of PC Andrew Harper were jailed for manslaughter, Janette McCormick, deputy chief constable at the College of Policing, said attention was required to tackle the inequality and job prospects facing Travellers. The three men were jailed on Friday for a total of 42 years. \u201cThere seems to be a deep-seated and accepted prejudice that demonises people from the community. You wouldn\u2019t call any other ethnicity inherently criminal,\u201d said McCormick, also the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for Gypsies, Roma and Travellers. Media reports on Saturday carried criticism of the travelling community, centred on the Four Houses Corner Travellers\u2019 site in Burghfield Common, Berkshire, that the killers came from, and stated that Henry Long, 19, the leader of the gang, had admitted his grandfather and father were also thieves. However, McCormick said it was important to note that the broader link between crime and UK Traveller communities was not conclusive. \u201cThere is no evidence to suggest we have a disproportionately high crime rate around Traveller sites,\u201d she said. The officer added: \u201cThe reality is within the communities you have huge disadvantages such as health, literacy, job prospects. Like any community where you have significant disadvantage, that can be correlated with crime. But you shouldn\u2019t link to ethnicity, it\u2019s the disadvantage we need to have the conversation about.\u201d Harper, 28, died as he attempted to apprehend the three teenagers who were trying to steal a quad bike. The officer became entangled in a tow rope attached to their Seat Toledo and was dragged at \u201cbreakneck\u201d speed for more than a mile along country lanes. Long, who was driving the car towing a stolen quad bike, was jailed for 16 years, while his accomplices Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole were each given 13 years. The UK\u2019s Traveller movement spoke out to strongly condemn the actions of the three killers, as well as their alleged lack of remorse and laughter during the trial. Pauline Anderson, chair of The Traveller Movement, said: \u201cThose lads are out of the picture now. PC Harper\u2019s family will never recover. Nor will their families. \u201cThere\u2019s so much shock and horror that this should happen \u2013 and to someone in the line of duty. The alleged lack of remorse is unforgivable.\u201d Other prominent figures in the Travelling community used even stronger language. Thomas McCarthy, an Irish Traveller folk singer, said: \u201cPC Harper was somebody\u2019s son. I don\u2019t care what background you have, if you rob someone, kill someone, you face the consequences like anybody else. They don\u2019t represent our community.\u201d But the fact that the case has been exploited by some quarters to stir up longstanding negative stereotypes has worried experts. Colin Clark, a sociology professor at the University of the West of Scotland who has studied the UK Travelling community, said: \u201cSome of the reporting on the case has suggested that being born a Traveller is a kind of criminal apprenticeship and that racist assumption needs to be challenged.\u201d Chris Kidd, a social work student at Bournemouth University who has carried out research for his MA into prejudice against Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities, also said that perceptions within the police and settled communities around higher crime rates were without substance. Kidd points to a 2016 study in one area of Romania, which demonstrated that areas with higher Roma populations had lower levels of crime. He added that stereotypes \u2013 such as the alleged theft of children by Travelling communities \u2013 were prevalent as long ago as the 19th century. \u201cAnti-Roma prejudice and stereotypes seem to constitute a pan-European phenomenon,\u201d said Kidd. Another cause of disquiet among the Travelling community is the Channel 4 Dispatches programme which was broadcast in April, and which looked at links between higher levels of crime and the location of some Traveller sites. The programme, about which the regulator, Ofcom, reportedly received thousands of complaints, remains available to watch, despite concerns from some police officers and academics over its accuracy. Other issues include the recent consultation on criminalising trespass, which would give the police powers to confiscate the homes of those suspected of trespassing \u2013 a proposed change which would affect many homeless community members, who pull up on roadsides and in other places on a temporary basis. \u201cIt is a bit disappointing that the only work within government is to criminalise trespass \u2013 I can see why community members feel that things are very attritional,\u201d said McCormick. Others lament some of the media coverage of the Harper trial for asserting that being born into nomadic communities equates to being born into criminality. Chelsea McDonagh, a young postgraduate and activist from a Traveller background, says: \u201cThe most damaging part of this is the wider discourse, by both the media and politicians, that Travellers are not adequately controlled. \u201cThere is absolutely no justification for what those three individuals did, but for journalists to say that our culture is the problem, that\u2019s really grossly offensive.\u201d McDonagh was particularly affronted by calls for the wider community to be punished for the actions of Harper\u2019s killers. \u201cSome voices are saying their families should be evicted. Why should they be punished for actions that are not their own? If you do bad, you are always a Traveller. But my ethnicity is not relevant when I\u2019ve done something good.\u201d Two of Harper\u2019s killers reportedly came from English Romani backgrounds, with the background of the third unknown. At the Berkshire site where Long was arrested, English Romanies and Irish Travellers live alongside each other. There are a number of nomadic communities living in the UK \u2013 the three most populous being English Gypsies, Irish (and Scots and Welsh) Travellers, and more recently arrived Roma \u2013 making up the umbrella group often referred to as the GRT communities. In addition, there are smaller communities, including Showpeople, associated for centuries with travelling shows, and boat-dwellers, as well as New Travellers, many of whom took to the road during the Thatcher era. Clark said that, for some sections of the media, the idea that all Travellers were born criminals would continue to prevail. \u201cThis idea that Travellers are born criminals due to genetics and culture goes back to the Holocaust. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing to read newspaper columnists who suggest \u2018Traveller culture\u2019 makes you a criminal at birth. It\u2019s just not true.\u201d But Anderson conceded that they needed to investigate the factors that drove Long, Bowers and Cole to commit the dreadful crime. \u201cWhat were the clues in the journey that those young people made? Our community should be given the space to condemn the crime, but not to bear the responsibility for it as an ethnic group. \u201cLet\u2019s look at the complexities of the causes of crime, the causal links between poverty and crime, let\u2019s tackle that. We are asking for an understanding that we condemn this crime, that it was morally wrong.\u201d McCarthy added: \u201cWe want to fight to be part of society, but you get something like this and it pushes us back so far. \u201d McDonagh, 24, said she wondered what lay in store for her generation. \u201cI have put my head above the parapet, but it takes a toll. We are working together collectively, and we are countering stereotypes, but our stories are not the ones people want to hear about.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 7 August 2020 to replace the main image with one more suitable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
