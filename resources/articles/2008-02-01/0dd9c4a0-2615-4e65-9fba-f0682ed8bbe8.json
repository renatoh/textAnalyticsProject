(Ezra Klein has a photo.) Says Richardson, with a smile: It's a period of decompression for me - and liberation from all you guys, and my political consultants. The big question, of course, is: which of the remaining Democratic candidates does Richardson like? Bill Clinton apparently twisted his former energy secretary's arm while they watched the Super Bowl together, but the New Mexico governor is staying mum - for now. \"I'm staying loose right now,\" he says, while adding: \"That doesn't mean I'm staying loose forever.\" So will he shave the beard? Diane Sawyer says he's \"looking very Justin Timberlake.\" Gibson interjects: \"He was trying to look Abe Lincoln.\" Whatever the case, Richardson does look pretty relaxed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
