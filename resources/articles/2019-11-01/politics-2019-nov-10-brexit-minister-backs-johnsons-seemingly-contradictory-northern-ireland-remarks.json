Kwasi Kwarteng said Johnson was \u201cabsolutely on the money\u201d when he told Northern Irish exporters last week that they would not need to fill in extra paperwork, prompting accusations the prime minister was misleading the public. In a video shot in Northern Ireland on Thursday night, Johnson told exporters they would not need to fill in customs declarations when they sent goods across the Irish Sea, adding that if firms were asked to they should call him \u201cand I will direct them to throw that form in the bin\u201d. This contradicted the view of Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, who told a House of Lords committee that businesses would need to complete \u201cexit summary declarations\u201d for such sending shipments. Asked on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show whether Barclay had been mistaken, Kwarteng said: \u201cI think you\u2019d have to ask him. But I think that the prime minister knows his deal, I mean, he negotiated it.\u201d Kwarteng said Johnson was correct to say there would be no customs forms and no checks: \u201cAs far as I understand I don\u2019t think there will be. I think the prime minister\u2019s absolutely right.\u201d Kwarteng also defended a Conservative analysis claiming that Labour\u2019s combined policies would cost \u00a31.2tn over five years, briefed to sympathetic newspapers on Sunday, but declined to give a parallel total for Conservative spending plans. He said the total had been compiled by \u201cpeople in [Conservative] central office, and also independent analysts\u201d after Mark Sedwill, the head of the civil service, blocked the release of a separate Treasury analysis of Labour plans. \u201cYou\u2019re quite right to say that Mark Sedwill blocked the costings from the civil service, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got a separate analysis,\u201d Kwarteng said. The total combines commitments from Labour\u2019s 2017 election manifesto \u2013 the party has yet to publish its current one \u2013 and adds other ideas such as a universal basic income and a four-day working week, some of which are by no means certain to form part of the 2019 manifesto. Asked about the equivalent total for Tory plans, Kwarteng said only that the party\u2019s commitments \u201care not anything as astronomical and as huge as the Labour sums\u201d. Pressed on a specific total, he added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to bandy around figures.\u201d Kwarteng also defended Johnson\u2019s comparison last week of Jeremy Corbyn to Stalin\u2019s treatment of the kulaks, wealthy farmers who were persecuted and in many cases murdered under the Soviet dictator. Kwarteng said Corbyn\u2019s attitude to wealth creators and entrepreneurs was similar to that of Stalin. However, he said he did not believe that the Labour leader actively planned to murder such people. When another business minister, Nadhim Zahawi, was asked by the BBC last week if he believed Corbyn wanted to have businesspeople shot, Zahawi answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know, you will have to ask him that question.\u201d Kwarteng said: \u201cThe comparison was about the philosophy and the Marxism. Nobody is suggesting that Jeremy Corbyn is going to line people up and shoot them.\u201d He added: \u201cNobody thinks Corbyn is going to kill anybody, let\u2019s be very clear about that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
