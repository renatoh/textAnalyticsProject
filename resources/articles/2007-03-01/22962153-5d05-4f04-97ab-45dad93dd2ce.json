When Manchester City used to be this bad, at least it was accompanied by the unfailingly ridiculous, those never-to-be-forgotten howlers that had everybody blinking with mirth and grinning like a loon. But this performance against Wigan, notably for the first 30 minutes, was both rotten and dull. Not a laugh to be had, unless it was the sight of Nicky Weaver playing \"Simon says\" as in \"Simon says don't move\", thus gifting Caleb Folan a free header for the winning goal. Anyway, somebody with a daft name such as Caleb ought to be playing for City. You might have supposed that Stuart Pearce would have ranted afterwards. Instead he talked quietly of sleeves having to be rolled up, and the possibility of quality being sacrificed on the altar of greater endeavour. Now, that was enough to make City fans laugh. Pearce would have everybody believe that there is nothing whatsoever wrong with the spirit within the club and that hard work on the practice ground will put matters right. The pertinent questions must be: do the players believe this, and have they the collective will to stop the rot? Footballers are simple souls and for the majority of this match the City players appeared confused. Perhaps it was because their manager had ditched the 3-5-2 formation in favour of a flatter 4-4-2. Certainly the change played directly into the hands of Wigan, who pushed hard forward from the off and stifled any semblance of rhythm, let alone pattern, in City's play. One of the worst teams City have produced in recent years was presided over by Frank Clark, himself a former Forest stalwart. On this evidence Pearce's may yet run that side close for general ineptitude. This was City's fourth Premiership home defeat in their past five. Worse still, since the beginning of December they have managed only 11 points from 12 games. Small wonder that Blues fans, for whom pessimism is second nature, are growing ever gloomier. Don't talk to the hundreds that left this match early about games in hand. The fact that Joey Barton had one of his more ineffective matches and that Micah Richards was rarely able to surge forward heavily depleted City's attacking options. Hatem Trabelsi lasted barely half an hour, and Georgios Samaras was fortunate to make it to half-time - he just isn't a footballer. At least the diminutive Emile Mpenza looked as if he knew where the goal was, and how to create a little space for himself, though it was entirely typical of City's overall play that the first ball aimed at him was four feet too high. Pearce payed \u00a36m for Samaras, the sort of price even Malcolm Allison might have balked at; Paul Jewell acquired Folan from Chesterfield for \u00a3500,000. \"He has loads to learn but he wants to,\" said the Wigan manager, who admitted that the years when you could go and watch a reserve match and see six or seven players who could go straight into your first team had long gone. \"I left Liverpool reserves for Wigan, but you see less and less of that these days. And everybody is watching the same games. Gone are the days when Bill Shankly or Bob Paisley could pull on a flat cap and nobody would know who they were.\" The fact remains that City knew all about Folan, who helped put them out of the Carling Cup this season, and were rumoured to be considering a bid. However, it was Jewell who turned up to watch Chesterfield almost knock out Charlton and who clearly saw enough to snap up what may prove the season's bargain - more fuel to stoke the bonfire of despond for the City supporters should Mpenza, late of Qatar, prove to be yet another foreign dud.
