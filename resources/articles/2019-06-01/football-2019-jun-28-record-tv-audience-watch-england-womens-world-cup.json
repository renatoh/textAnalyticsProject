A record-breaking 7.6 million people tuned in to BBC One back home to cheer on the Lionesses as they trounced their Scandinavian opposition. The figures, based on people watching for five minutes or more, made it the UK\u2019s most-watched women\u2019s football game ever. The number tuning in on Thursday to watch England\u2019s passage to the next stage beat the previous best for a women\u2019s game of 6.9 million for Sunday\u2019s victory over Cameroon. On 9 June a peak of 6.1 million saw England beat Scotland 2-0. The Lionesses will face either France or the USA in the semi-finals on Tuesday. The final is on Sunday 7 July at 4pm UK time. Support for the team has grown as momentum has built. The former England men\u2019s captain David Beckham was among the crowd watching Thursday\u2019s game, along with his daughter Harper. The BBC sports presenter Clare Balding tweeted: \u201cWhat a great result. A top performance from a team to inspire pride and love.\u201d Prince William also sent a personal message of support. The FA president said: \u201cWhat a performance Lionesses, a superb display! The whole country is behind you going into Tuesday\u2019s semi-final, bring it on!\u201d The BBC said the 2019 tournament had extended its record for TV reach to 22.2 million, well in excess of the 12.4 million set in 2015 during the Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada. Bronze , the Lyon full-back who scored the third goal against Norway with a strike from outside the box, has established herself as one of the stars of the tournament. She also set up Scott\u2019s opener and was involved in the build-up to the Lionesses\u2019 second goal, scored by White. Sue Campbell, the head of women\u2019s football at the FA, said the players had battled their way to the top. \u201cIt\u2019s not like male footballers \u2026 these are women who when they first started playing, people were not always positive about them playing football. They have overcome every barrier. \u201cThey are wonderful role models for all girls no matter what they want to do. These girls tell you whatever you want to do you can do it if you work hard and are prepared to make sacrifices. They are terrific role models.\u201d Campbell said it was important to make sure those inspired by the Lionesses had a chance to play. \u201cWe need to make sure the inspiration they get from watching this World Cup turns into participation by thousands of young girls,\u201d she added. The excitement generated by the players was felt across the UK, with festivalgoers at Glastonbury watching the match in their thousands. The decision to show the game on the West Holt stage came came after a plea from the Lionesses midfielder Georgia Stanway, who tweeted at organisers to ask them to show it. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a good tournament so far and I was sad when I thought I wasn\u2019t going to be able to watch the game because of being at Glastonbury,\u201d said 31-year-old Simon Bradley, from Manchester. \u201cThere was a party atmosphere. England scored within a few minutes and from then on it was a really good performance.\u201d Scott Mundy, 25, from north London, said watching the women\u2019s football in one of the festival\u2019s biggest spaces was a far cry from his previous experience of watching Wimbledon in a bar on the site. \u201cThe audience [for women\u2019s football] is way more tolerant and accepting. That was reflected in the crowd \u2013 it wasn\u2019t laddy. And if that\u2019s the culture across women\u2019s football as a whole then hopefully it\u2019s something that could start to influence men\u2019s football too.\u201d Meanwhile, the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said England\u2019s success could increase beer sales by 3m pints. Samuel Dewey, the landlord at Saint John\u2019s Yard in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said interest in the matches this year had been far higher than that of previous tournaments. \u201cIt is important that we show just as much interest in this as the men\u2019s side of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow children in the evenings normally, but we have done with the Women\u2019s World Cup so they can watch it too. \u201cPeople are really excited about it. There will be chanting, and there was a nice atmosphere for last night\u2019s game \u2013 everyone was enjoying it.\u201d Julie Neville, the wife of Phil Neville, said on BBC Radio Manchester\u2019s Breakfast Show with Chelsea Norris that she had seen how much her husband had put into the job. \u201cWhen he was offered the job, he was really interested in it, but a big criticism at the time was that he didn\u2019t know a lot about women\u2019s football. He said he was going to fully immerse himself in it \u2026 I have seen him do that.\u201d She added: \u201cI have seen how committed he is and what it means to him. He said in an interview that it was one of the best things he has done in his life and I can see that.\u201d The former England player Claire Rafferty said the team had a real chance of winning the tournament. \u201cA great deal of it goes down to luck and sometimes, unfortunately, you\u2019re unlucky like we were last time around. I feel like you need that on your side but you can create your own luck and the girls get through on hard work.\u201d She added: \u201cEvery single one in our starting 11 would be playing in anyone\u2019s starting 11 around the world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
