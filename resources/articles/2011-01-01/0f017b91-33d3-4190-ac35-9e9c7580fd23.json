Its follow-up, The Deep Field \u2013 with a title referencing distant clusters of stars and cover art that's more open and welcoming \u2013 is her self-described \"joyous record\". Gone, for the most part, are the haunting piano ballads, and in their place are looser musical expositions that display her deft songcraft. Opener Nervous chugs along nicely, all guitar scratches and organ fills, before the melody shifts slightly ahead of the chorus and it becomes almost unbearably lovely. First single The Magic and Kiss the Specifics (\"yes I'm in love\") both recall the dreamy wonder of her debut, Real Life. Unfortunately, while Wasser's featherlight voice suits the slower songs, it has a tendency to sound slightly one-dimensional on the over-fussy bigger numbers, and there are moments when it drifts too close to polite MOR."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
