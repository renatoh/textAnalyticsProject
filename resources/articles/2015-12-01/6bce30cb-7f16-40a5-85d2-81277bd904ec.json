Until then, thank you for all the comments and don\u2019t have nightmares. \u2019Night! So, it\u2019s Vana and Joseph who\u2019ll be launching their businesses in Sunday\u2019s final. Do you think Lord Sugar chose the right finalists? After all, he could have had Tricky Dicky, Corporate G or the fabulous Charleine... That was emotional. Richard\u2019s the real winner, in his eyes at least: \u201cThroughout this process I\u2019ve been the most successful candidate.\u201d And Vana\u2019s in the final. Joseph\u2019s made it to the final. He\u2019s like the Reggie N Bollie of The Apprentice. Oh, here goes Tricky Dicky again. He\u2019s giving 100%. It used to be 110%. Is that how deflation works? It\u2019s time to beg in the last chance saloon. Vana: \u201cI have a passion for this and I can bring this to fruition.\u201d Joseph: \u201cI\u2019ve learned the core lessons and now it\u2019s about moving forward.\u201d Richard: well, he\u2019s the Swiss Army knife of business. How can Vana still be in when the goddess that is Charleine has been given the boot? They\u2019re dropping like flies. Gary: You\u2019re fired! What? That\u2019s it? We didn\u2019t even get to see Charleine wheel her suitcase out. Joseph\u2019s non-existence \u2019tache has been getting more attention than her. Uh-oh, is he next? So Lord Sugar thinks Charleine should take hairdressing advice from Claude? She\u2019s fired! No way. The woman is a sensation. No way could Corporate G sign off a million pounds. Still, that would get you a whole load of disco lights. So, it\u2019s like Skype in a nightclub? Hire him! \u201cIt sounds like an event for the Piers Morgan fan club.\u201d Lord Sugar is hot like fi-yah tonight. This looks like they\u2019re all going to be needing those wheelie suitcases. Imagine if Lord Sugar fired everyone and then just devoted Sunday night to Gary\u2019s Mobile Disco. Uh-oh. Linda Plant broke Tricky Dicky. What a woman. Cost burn is actually quite a nice name for a dating app. Great questions to ask in an interview situation: \u201cHave you used online dating before?\u201d A mobile disco is basically a global event planner, isn\u2019t it? Gary\u2019s got lighting and everything. Come on, Joseph, get your flirt on. \u201cI just want the world and everything in it.\u201d What, everything? War, sprouts and dogs in handbags? He\u2019s not right. Does anyone speak Marketing? Having a bit of trouble understanding what Tricky Dicky\u2019s saying. He\u2019s climbing a mountain with a track record in yomping or something. \u201cI\u2019ll absolutely work my socks off to be an icon.\u201d Charleine is like the Welsh Madonna. Getting stressed? Simply take one shoe off and chillax. A business tip from Joseph for you. Littner\u2019s going in and Richard\u2019s keeping calm. For now. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bad 1980s marketing book.\u201d Ouch. Oof, it\u2019s a Lord Sugar quiz! And Joseph knows his stuff. Newsflash: No Margaret or Nick. Here\u2019s hoping they\u2019ll make a Craig David-style entrance later. This is terrifying. Plant could break a woman with those waving glasses. \u201cI\u2019m very big with wedding hair.\u201d Bring out the big guns, Charl. Soutar\u2019s seen straight through Corporate G. Nothing gets past this man. \u201cI was actually taken out of the corporate machine,\u201d says Gary. So tonight\u2019s interviewers: publishing pioneer Mike Soutar, media agency boss Claudine Collins, no-nonsense interior design guru Linda Plant and angry boiled egg Claude Littner. Ah, remember those soft years when they used to keep him tethered until interview night? Charleine hasn\u2019t had an interview for 15 years, Vana can talk her way out of a gherkin-shaped bag, Richard\u2019s \u201cmassively confident\u201d and Joseph looks like the most likely to fluff it. And Gary? He\u2019s brandishing notes. \u201cPhone!\u201d They need to meet Lord Sugar with their business plans. It\u2019s the call of doom. Here we go. People are putting up deckchairs. They\u2019re saying: \u201cWhatever\u201d. They\u2019re panicking and squealing. It\u2019s a classic Apprentice recap. Pass the \u201cBoo-ba-bar\u201d and let the interviews begin. Welcome to the finest night of The Apprentice year: the job interviews. Even if you only watched Sir Alan\u2019s antics for the kids\u2019 party episode, come on in because the sight of the final five rolling out their best soundbites while quivering in fear is not to be missed. The brilliant Julia Raeside isn\u2019t around tonight, so I\u2019m standing in for your liveblog pleasure. Guys, guys, I can assure you I\u2019m passionate, 110% committed and a real team player. I also have a good working knowledge of Excel. That last bit\u2019s a lie, but who needs a spreadsheet when you have a pocketful of cheap one-liners? Anyway, join me at 9pm and we can all laugh at the pain, safe in the knowledge that we\u2019re drinking wine at home and not in a job interview."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
