Whereas the victorious Schumacher reacted to the incident in Sunday's Brazilian grand prix with measured professionalism - praising Montoya for his fair driving at the first turn and feigning surprise over what happened three corners later, when the Williams clipped the back of his Ferrari and lost its front wing - Montoya displayed a hot-headedness that Schumacher will be confident of exploiting as the season develops. \"Frankly I don't think Juan really has a great deal to complain about,\" admitted one of Montoya's Williams colleagues, a view underlined by the way the Williams mechanics threw their hands up in despair when they saw Montoya slowing after the clash. The Colombian, though, would not accept any blame. Instead he criticised the FIA for failing to penalise Schumacher for unfair blocking, after Montoya had been given a pit-lane drive-through penalty for their first-corner collision in Malaysia a fortnight ago. \"The FIA is amazing,\" Montoya fumed, after battling back to fifth place. \"What a lack of consistency. Being Michael, they will ignore it. It's typical.\" He was equally critical of Schumacher. \"I thought he was a fair guy to race with but he is not,\" Montoya said. \"I gave him room around the first two corners but then he moved into the middle of the track. I was behind him but, when I made my move, he shut the door as soon as he could in front of me. \"Now we know what the rules are. Next time I will just do the same as him.\" Another Williams team member backed him. \"Michael gave Juan a double chop going down that hill,\" he said. Montoya is not the first to criticise Schumacher's robust driving style nor to imply a degree of inconsistency in the way the FIA applies its rules, particularly in matters concerning Ferrari. But the Colombian, rather than bemoaning his misfortune, urgently needs to temper his tremendous natural speed and skill with the sort of tactical discipline that Schumacher consistently applies to such brilliant effect. The German's triumph on the debut outing of the Ferrari F2002 gives the four-time champion an eight-point lead over Montoya's team-mate Ralf Schumacher, who pushed his brother to the limit in finishing second only half a second behind, with the Colombian a further two points adrift. Montoya represents a welcome boost to formula one's excitement levels but, if he is not to lose more ground to the Schumachers, he must quickly learn that a race cannot be won on the first lap but it can certainly be lost. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
