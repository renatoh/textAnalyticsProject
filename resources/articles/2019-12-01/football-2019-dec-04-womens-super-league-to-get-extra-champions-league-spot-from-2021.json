Currently the top two teams in England qualify. This season that meant Chelsea, who reached last term\u2019s Champions League semi-final before losing 3-2 to the eventual winners, Lyon, over two legs, missed out after they finished third in the WSL behind Arsenal and Manchester City. For the 2021-22 season, each of the top six nations \u2013 calculated according to Uefa\u2019s coefficients \u2013 will receive a third team, and TV rights and sponsorship from the group stage onwards will be marketed centrally, rather than just the final. Countries ranked seventh to 16th will have two entrants. Managers have been calling for a revamp. Last month Chelsea\u2019s Emma Hayes said of a third spot for England: \u201cThat needs to happen. The same for Germany, though, and probably France.\u201d Arsenal\u2019s Joe Montemurro said in September that a group stage was a logical step. \u201cIt\u2019s only fair to the clubs that do invest in women\u2019s football that they should be given the opportunity to be in the Champions League from a revenue perspective. And once you get a third team from, say, England making the Champions League group stages there\u2019s a revenue coming back. That\u2019s more money coming into the game.\u201d Uefa\u2019s president, Aleksander Ceferin, said: \u201cBy guaranteeing teams more matches against their elite rivals, we believe the group structure will raise the quality of the women\u2019s game even more.\u201d Qualification for the group stage will come through two rounds. Round one will see teams play a series of mini-tournaments, with semi-finals, a third-place match and a final. Then pre-qualified teams will play round one winners over two legs to determine entry into the group stage. The top two finishers of the four groups will progress to the quarter-finals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
