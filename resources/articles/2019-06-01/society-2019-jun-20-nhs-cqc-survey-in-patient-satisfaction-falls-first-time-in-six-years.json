The proportion of people admitted to hospital who are satisfied with their care fell last year for the first time in six years, an official survey of 76,000 patients found. \u201cStaff are working incredibly hard but it is clear we have reached a point where this alone is not enough,\u201d said Prof Ted Baker, the chief inspector of hospitals at the Care Quality Commission (CQC). \u201cThe mounting pressure on the system is having a direct impact on how people are experiencing inpatient care.\u201d He said the need for care was rising so rapidly at a time of acute staff shortages that the NHS\u2019s progress towards providing better care had stalled and in some areas was going backwards. The findings of the CQC\u2019s annual inpatient survey were the worst in the last 10 years. They are based on the views of 76,000 people who were being cared for in hospital in England on one day in July 2018. Experts said the results were alarming and showed that the NHS could no longer always look after every patient properly because it was so hamstrung by shortages of staff and money. While large majorities of participants were happy with their experience, smaller numbers of people increasingly raised concerns. Some of these included: One in 10 (11%) inpatients said they should have been admitted to hospital \u201ca lot\u201d sooner \u2013 the highest percentage in a decade. Almost one in six \u201cdefinitely\u201d felt they had to wait too long to get a bed on a ward once they had been admitted. A third (33%) did not think hospital staff were doing everything they could to control their pain, while 32% felt they did not get enough help to wash. Only 59% said they could always get a member of hospital staff to help them within a reasonable time. The proportions of patients who said they always had confidence and trust in nurses (77%) and doctors (79%) both fell between 2017 and last year. Just 37% said they could definitely find a staff member with whom to discuss their worries and fears, and 53% felt they always got enough emotional support. Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, which represents specialists in general and acute medicine, said: \u201cThe results from the data released by the CQC absolutely reflect the everyday realities of urgent medical care in the NHS. They show that despite the often heroic efforts of staff on the ground, the relentless pressures building in the system for years on end are starting to take a toll. \u201cThe dissatisfaction expressed might reflect the growing realism amongst the population that the NHS is struggling, and not only in winter, and people are no longer prepared to put up with things that aren\u2019t good enough. It is of no surprise that given the issues around staffing, at times people cannot find someone to talk to when they felt the need.\u201d Fewer patients said they felt involved with their care and had received written information about their medicines. Discharge from hospital was another area of concern. A quarter said their release from hospital was delayed by at least four hours, while 40% did not get printed information about how to look after themselves when they got home. It is the latest set of data in recent months showing falling patient contentment with the NHS. Dan Wellings, a senior fellow at the King\u2019s Fund thinktank, said: \u201cThe 2018 British Social Attitudes survey found public satisfaction with how the NHS is run at its lowest level in over a decade and there is rising dissatisfaction with GP services, particularly around access. Combined, the results of these surveys should be giving politicians and NHS leaders significant cause for concern.\u201d NHS England did not directly address the CQC research\u2019s negative findings. A spokesperson said: \u201cThis survey is further evidence that in the vast majority of cases patients are happy with the care they received, but also that the NHS and its local partners need to continue to join up services around the needs of patients, as set out in the NHS Long Term Plan.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
