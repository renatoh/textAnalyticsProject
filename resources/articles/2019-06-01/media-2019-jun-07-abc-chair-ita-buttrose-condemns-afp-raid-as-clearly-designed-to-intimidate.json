The former journalist and publisher says she has registered her \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the unprecedented raids on the ABC and News Corp over two days and she won\u2019t countenance any interference with the public\u2019s right to know. \u201cAn untrammelled media is important to the public discourse and to democracy,\u201d Buttrose said. \u201cIt is the way in which Australian citizens are kept informed about the world and its impact on their daily lives. \u201cObservance of this basic tenet of the community\u2019s right to know has driven my involvement in public life and my career in journalism for almost five decades. \u201cIn a frank conversation with the minister for communications, cyber safety and the arts, Paul Fletcher, yesterday, I said the raid, in its very public form and in the sweeping nature of the information sought, was clearly designed to intimidate.\u201d Buttrose\u2019s statement is the strongest condemnation of the raids to come out of the ABC hierarchy this week and marks her leadership style as being more independent of government than her predecessor, Justin Milne. She was confirmed as chair of the ABC five months after the former chair resigned in the wake of allegations of political interference. The 77-year-old former women\u2019s magazine editor and TV personality was a captain\u2019s pick by the Coalition, emerging as a surprise candidate after the global headhunters\u2019 shortlist of three men was rejected. \u201cIt is impossible to ignore the seismic nature of this week\u2019s events: raids on two separate media outfits on consecutive days is a blunt signal of adverse consequences for news organisations who make life uncomfortable for policy makers and regulators by shining lights in dark corners and holding the powerful to account,\u201d she said. \u201cI also asked for assurances that the ABC not be subject to future raids of this sort. Mr Fletcher declined to provide such assurances, while noting the \u2018substantial concern\u2019 registered by the Corporation. \u201cThere has been much reference in recent days to the need to observe the rule of law. \u201cWhile there are legitimate matters of national security that the ABC will always respect, the ABC Act and Charter are explicit about the importance of an independent public broadcaster to Australian culture and democracy. \u201cPublic interest is best served by the ABC doing its job, asking difficult questions and dealing with genuine whistle-blowers who risk their livelihoods and reputations to bring matters of grave import to the surface. Neither the journalists nor their sources should be treated as criminals. \u201cIn my view, legitimate journalistic endeavours that expose flawed decision-making or matters that policy makers and public servants would simply prefer were secret, should not automatically and conveniently be classed as issues of national security. \u201cThe onus must always be on the public\u2019s right to know. If that is not reflected sufficiently in current law, then it must be corrected.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
