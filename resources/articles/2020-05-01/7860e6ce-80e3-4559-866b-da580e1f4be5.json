Top stories Hong Kong\u2019s future autonomy has been dealt a \u201ckiller blow\u201d after China\u2019s governing legislature approved controversial national security laws aimed at stamping out protests that have racked the territory for the past year. Delegates in Beijing broke into applause after the legislation was passed, prompting a pro-democracy legislator in Hong Kong, Claudia Mo, to proclaim that: \u201cHong Kong as we knew it is finally dead.\u201d The UK\u2019s foreign secretary has said that it will extend visa rights for up to 300,000 British nations from Hong Kong \u2013 allowing them a pathway to UK citizenship \u2013 should China persist in imposing repressive laws over the territory. Australia\u2019s historic decline in jobs and incomes due to the coronavirus has steadied, new research from the Australian National University has determined. Average hours worked increased in May, with the percentage of Australians in work levelling out, after about 600,000 lost their jobs in April. More than half of those surveyed remain anxious about Covid-19, however, with nearly a third believing it very likely they will be infected in the next six months. In part four of our special investigation, Stimulus under scrutiny, we look at the supports provided for small and medium businesses, and the potential minefields awaiting once supports are turned off. Four shortlisted purchasers, due to lodge bids for Virgin Australia on Friday, have expressed anxiety over a lack of governmental support, Guardian Australia has learned. The airline faces a four to six-week period without cash, between any mooted sale next month and a key creditors\u2019 meeting due to be held in August. Further uncertainties over the sale process have fuelled fears it could collapse, which would send the airline into liquidation \u2013 leaving 10,000 people without jobs and handing Qantas a near monopoly over Australian air travel. Australia Australian Jock Palfreeman is a step closer to freedom after Bulgaria\u2019s highest court dismissed an appeal against his release from jail. The Sydney man was released in October after serving nearly 12 years behind bars, but has been prevented from leaving the country by the Bulgarian government. He was found guilty of murder and attempted murder for stabbing two Bulgarian youths in 2007 and has always maintained he acted in self-defence. Irrigators have illegally harvested unregulated and unmeasured water from floodplains for decades, water officials have admitted, a sum accounting for up to a third of all water used by operators in the northern part of the Murray-Darling Basin. The 2018 South Australian royal commission described floodplain harvesting as \u201cone of the most significant threats to water security \u2026 to both licence holders and downstream states\u201d. The federal government has asked China to grant Australia the same reduction in bureaucratic trade barriers that Beijing has promised the United States, amid fears smaller trading nations might suffer \u201ccollateral damage\u201d from a deal between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Lower power prices and more than 100,000 new jobs could be Australia\u2019s rewards for a rapid shift to renewable energy, a new briefing paper suggests, with former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull describing Beyond Zero Emissions\u2019 analysis as \u201ccompellingly right\u201d. Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions dropped only marginally last year \u2013 down 0.9% \u2013 although this was largely driven by a shift towards investment in renewable energy. The world The US department of justice has made its investigation of police involvement in the death of George Floyd a \u201ctop priority\u201d after a second evening of street clashes in Minneapolis. The FBI will investigate whether the officers involved also violated federal laws. The US president, Donald Trump, has signed an executive order that could erode legal protections for social media companies, in an escalation of his ongoing spat after Twitter affixed fact-checking warnings to several of his tweets. A French political power couple have been handed prison sentences for money laundering. Patrick Balkany and his wife, Isabelle, the former mayor and deputy mayor of a Parisian suburb, were convicted of hiding at least \u20ac13m from tax authorities. Recommended reads From Insta-worthy whipped coffees and ego-sourdough to recipes with their own hashtags, during lockdown food has gone as viral as coronavirus itself. But what is Dalgona coffee? And how do you actually make sourdough? Adam Liaw power-ranks the favourite food trends of iso. \u201cWhen the world collapsed, we made sourdough. We made sourdough even though we couldn\u2019t buy flour. We made sourdough even though all the stores were full of bread.\u201d The humble office can be a much-maligned place. But for perennial freelancer and itinerant wanderer Brigid Delaney there is so much to celebrate about the work space: \u201cI went into the office each day for a whole range of reasons: structure, community, inspiration, the fellowship of my fellow underemployed freelancers, leads from them about work, to test pitches of my stories, to subedit copy (we passed our work around to be checked by one another) and the magic itself of the office building.\u201d A year before isolation struck us all, acclaimed director Warwick Thornton turned solitude into an art-form \u2013 secluding himself in a beach shack in remote Western Australia, capturing it all in trademarked stunning cinematography. \u201cIt\u2019s a romantic idea of self-isolation,\u201d Thornton tells Luke Buckmaster, \u201cwith lots of hunting and gathering, some tears, and a bloke standing on a beach near a bush shack that looks like it\u2019s from a beautiful novel. It\u2019s kind of romantic fiction. It\u2019s Mills and Boon for blokes!\u201d Listen The killing of Ahmaud Arbery. A young black man was shot dead by a white father and son duo in Georgia, US, on 23 February. And yet it took the leaking of a video of the shooting to emerge in May before charges were laid. On this episode of Full Story, Anushka Asthana speaks to Guardian US reporters Sam Levine and Khushbu Shah, and lawyer Chris Stewart to find out why.

Media roundup Chinese-born Australian MP Gladys Liu has accused Beijing of undermining Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, telling the Sydney Morning Herald the proposed security laws could end the principle of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The ABC reports that NSW clubs could welcome crowds of more than 500 patrons in some venues from Monday. And an Australian vet aboard the Covid-struck live export vessel, the Al Kuwait, has accused governments worldwide of \u201ctyranny\u201d in their response to the pandemic, writes the West Australian. Coming up Days after a once-in-a-decade storm brought widespread destruction to large parts of Western Australia, another big system is forecast for the state\u2019s south. It\u2019s Alan Jones\u2019 final day on air. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 An apex predator the size of your thumb has Canadian apiarists hugely concerned. Nicknamed the \u201cmurder hornet\u201d, the orange and black Asian giant hornet is believed to have made the jump to North America, spreading deep into British Columbia. The hornets have an especially gruesome habit of destroying hives: \u201cThey just cut their heads off, cut their bodies in half, and you end up with a slaughter on the ground.\u201d Sign up If you would like to receive the Guardian Australia morning mail to your email inbox every weekday, sign up here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
