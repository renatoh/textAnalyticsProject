Why was the bank allowed to collapse after a febrile weekend of meetings in September 2008, sending shockwaves through an already ailing world financial system? Was a potential takeover by Barclays blocked? Having a stab at the first draft of history, here's the story as it seemed to insiders on both sides of the Atlantic, including the likes of Tim Geithner, US secretary of the treasury, and Alistair Darling. The doomed expansionism of Lehman's CEO Dick Fuld, a man who simply took far too many risks, hangs heavy over proceedings. Excellent. Alone in the Wild 9pm, Channel 4 Forget the SAS prowess of Bear Grylls, what would it be like if someone who doesn't know what kind of elephant dung is safe to eat was thrust into the wild? That's almost the premise here as Ed Wardle, a cameraman who has scaled Everest (so hardly Joe Bloggs), is dumped in the Yukon with basic supplies, a gun and emergency GPS. Will he survive hunting for his own food, or will the huge demands of living in the wild defeat him? Katy Brand's Big Ass Show; Lunch Monkeys 10pm, ITV2; 10.30pm, BBC3 Katy Brand is back on ITV2 for a third series of sketches, and though she's shifting things around a bit \u2013 a \"fine\" Jennifer Aniston is the new \"normal\" Kate Winslet \u2013 she still has a canny ability to dismantle the silliness of celebrity. Over on BBC3, newcomer Lunch Monkeys has a stab at office-based comedy, which is brave, given that it's already been defined by one of the best shows in recent history. There's a man wearing a name badge with the word \"penis\" on it, and that really is as funny as it gets. The Wire 11.20pm, BBC2 Anybody who has latched on to The Wire for the first time during its run on terrestrial will presently be suffering the mixed feelings known to the cult cop show's box-set adherents: intense interest in seeing how this concluding episode winds it all down, laced with reluctance to admit that it's all over. The final season of The Wire is not the programme's peak \u2013 the absurdity of the central plotline, though deliberate, felt somewhat overcooked. That quibble aside, this is as toweringly great as everyone says it is."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
