But it was unclear last night how soon the ban on taking hand luggage aboard aircraft will be lifted. Whitehall sources suggested it could extend deep into next week. The transport secretary, Douglas Alexander, said details of the new regime were still being discussed with the airline industry: \"A new set of security arrangements will be issued. It will be a regime that recognises and deals with the terrorist threat but is capable of operating in an environment that is as busy as an airport.\" Mr Alexander and the home secretary, John Reid, attended an emergency meeting of the National Aviation Security Council yesterday afternoon. They updated industry officials on the security situation and consulted them on the effect of the measures introduced on Thursday. But they gave no guidance on when the restrictions would be lifted or whether they would be the cornerstone of the security regime to be issued by Mr Alexander's department. The guidelines ban hand luggage from aircraft cabins, apart from a limited number of items such as travel documents, which must be carried in transparent plastic bags. The measures have contributed to the long delays experienced by passengers. Restrictions on hand luggage are a particular headache for low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and easyJet. Budget airlines are hoping to reduce costs, and keep down air fares amid rising oil prices, by encouraging passengers to travel with hand luggage only and check in online. Analysts said keeping the restrictions in place for the long term would have financial implications for low-cost operators. \"This will raise the cost of baggage handling and slow down the turnaround time for the plane as well,\" said Chris Tarry at the aviation consultancy CTaira. A spokesman for Ryanair said it was too early to tell if the measures would become permanent, adding that the carrier had managed to hold down its average fare despite an exponential rise in fuel prices. Security experts have warned that airports will need to upgrade and replace the checkpoint equipment used to scan cabin baggage. The alleged transatlantic bomb plot involved detonating liquid bombs, contained in drinks bottles. While checked-in luggage is subjected to five layers of screenings, including scans that have a higher chance of detecting liquid bombs, hand baggage is processed through an x-ray machine. Technology is being developed, by companies such as Australia's QR Sciences, that can detect explosive substances such as nitrogen. But the machines cost around \u00a395,000 each. Increased scrutiny of hand luggage will also increase congestion at already crowded airports such as Heathrow. The EU said yesterday that it would gather aviation security experts for a meeting next week to discuss the thwarted terror plot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
