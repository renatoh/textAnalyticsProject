During Franken\u2019s time as a comic, which included two long stints on Saturday Night Live from 1975-1980 and 1985-1995, he came under fire for telling sexist jokes, some of which made light of sexual abuse and rape. In a 1995 New York Magazine profile of Saturday Night Live, Franken is quoted making vulgar jokes about rape during a brainstorm for a sketch written by Norm MacDonald that involved sedatives. \u201c\u2018I give the pills to Lesley Stahl,\u2019\u201d Franken says, referencing the CBS News reporter while pitching a line for the sketch. \u201c\u2018Then, when Lesley\u2019s passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her.\u2019 Or, \u2018That\u2019s why you never see Lesley until February.\u2019 Or, \u2018When she passes out, I put her in various positions and take pictures of her.\u2019\u201d Franken was also highly criticized during his initial 2008 senatorial campaign for an article he wrote for Playboy Magazine in 2000, in which he imagines a fictional Institute for Pornographic Studies in Northridge, California. \u201cAs Dr. DeVine led me to the Future wing of the institute, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that she is an extremely attractive blonde with a tight, round ass, legs that won\u2019t quit and firm but ample breasts,\u201d Franken wrote. \u201cSo ample, in fact, that she received a full scholarship from MIT. \u201cI found myself extremely attracted to the vulnerable side of this sexy scientist, and when I offered to comfort her, she accepted, kissing me full on the lips and inserting her tongue into my mouth and moving it around suggestively,\u201d the piece continues. \u201cThen she reached down and started rubbing my crotch and within just five or ten minutes, my cock was again hard and ready for action.\u201d On at least one other occasion, Franken has been quoted making jokes about child rape, including at a Comedy Central roast of director Rob Reiner, and women, including at an event hosted by the Feminist Majority Foundation in 1999, where he said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we focus on what Afghan women can do? They can cook, bear children, and pray. As I recall, that was fine for our grandmothers.\u201d Franken apologised to Tweeden in a statement made shortly after the news anchor for TalkRadio 790 KABC in Los Angeles wrote about how he had required them to kiss on the lips to prepare for a script and was photographed groping her breasts while she slept. \u201cI respect women. I don\u2019t respect men who don\u2019t,\u201d Franken wrote. \u201cAnd the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.\u201d Tweeden gave a press conference on Thursday responding to Franken\u2019s apology. \u201cThe apology, sure, I accept it, yes. People make mistakes and of course he knew he made a mistake. So yes, I do accept that apology,\u201d she said, going on to comment about the a proposed ethics investigation into Franken and calls for him to step down. \u201cThe ethics investigation? If that\u2019s what Mitch McConnell wants to do, that\u2019s on them. I\u2019m not calling for that. I\u2019m not demanding that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not calling for him to step down. That\u2019s not my place. That\u2019s not my call. I\u2019m not saying that. People make mistakes.\u201d In the wake of the allegations, numerous senators have publicly denounced Franken\u2019s behavior, including the Democrats Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Dick Durbin. Tweeden\u2019s account of the senator\u2019s misconduct comes as sexual assault allegations send shockwaves through Hollywood and Washington, with producer Harvey Weinstein and Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore, among many others, facing accusations by numerous women."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
