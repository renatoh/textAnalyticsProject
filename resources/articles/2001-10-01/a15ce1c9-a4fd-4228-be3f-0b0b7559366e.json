The leaked letters show that in June when the transport secretary announced a \"doubling\" of the tube's grant for 2001-2002, a heated dispute was going on in private between the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR) and London Underground (LU) over a sharp and unexpected cut in promised spending. In the immediate aftermath of Labour's general election victory, Mr Byers trumpeted a large increase in support for the tube - from \u00a3104m to \u00a3520m - saying that he was making sure it was \"properly funded\". But the total was much less than John Prescott, his predecessor, had promised before the election. Since November 2000, LU had been primed to expect a grant of \u00a3775m for the financial year beginning in April 2001 and had already begun working and spending on that basis. According to the correspondence, LU's finance chief accused the government of a \"major u-turn\" and expressed his concern at its impact on tube safety. \"Safety imperatives\" would get \u00a330m less, \u00a316m would have to be cut immediately from maintenance of lifts and escalators, and \u00a372m would come off the budget for keeping up stations. The reliability of the train service would suffer, he warned. \"Critical safety and asset health expenditure will be deferred,\" he wrote. The press notice claiming an increase in funding was put out through civil service channels. It is not known whether Mr Byers' controversy-dogged special adviser, Jo Moore, was involved in the announcement but she has always been close to any political decisions in the department. Yesterday she again apologised for an email sent on September 11 calling on civil servants to put out bad news under the cover of the attacks on America. LU's budget for 2001-2002 had never been publicly announced, but because of assurances that the money was on its way, tube executives had begun to spend it. In the correspondence, Patrick Butcher, LU director of finance, warned civil servants from the then Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Treasury that the cut was \"unmanageable\". Mr Butcher has since resigned and leaves at the end of the year. Referring to the cut, he wrote: \"We are in the political spotlight and it would not be difficult for the media and others to construe the consequences as a further threat to safety and further misery for Londoners.\" Mr Byers' officials yesterday repeated that the 2001-2002 grant represented a significant cash increase on the \u00a3267m allocated in 2000-2001, and played down the differences between them and LU as normal bargaining during the spending round. The grant even allowed \"some improvements\". But LU has been losing increasing money on its operations in recent years, and without extra government support would have been unable to make even the basic investment needed to keep it running. The transport secretary's tendency to seek to manipulate the news - or have it massaged on his behalf by advisers - is demonstrated by his claim to be increasing government aid to LU by \u00a3416m. This figure only makes sense if it is based on what the Treasury admitted was a \"notional\" or \"interim\" grant for 2001-2002. A very low figure, \u00a3104m, was put into the public accounts with an asterisk against it. The actual grant could not be divulged, it was said, because of negotiations with companies bidding for public-private partnership contracts. London Underground said yesterday: \"The reduction in planned investment has in no way affected our high safety standards. It is no secret that London Underground has been underfunded for years.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
