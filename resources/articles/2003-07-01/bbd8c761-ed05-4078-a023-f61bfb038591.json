He also proved, if it needed proving, that he will be difficult to dislodge as Open champion at Royal St George's next week when he defends the title he won at Muirfield last year. At least Els is sure of his place at St George's, which is more than can be said for a few other names that, if not as big as the South African's, carry a certain significance in the world of golf. One of them is Ian Woosnam, the former US Masters champion who came so close to victory two years ago at Royal Lytham, where his chance of glory vanished when he was found to have one too many clubs in his bag after he had played the first hole of the final round. He was penalised two strokes and eventually wound up tied for third place. Two years on and Woosnam's is among the names listed for final qualifying for the Open next Sunday and Monday. It is an opportunity that he will probably decline. But he has a chance here this week to earn his spot. There is an order of merit based on performances since the PGA Championship at Wentworth in May, from which the top seven at the end of this week earn spots in the field for next week. Woosnam is unlikely to qualify that way. But he has another chance. The top eight finishers this week who are otherwise not exempt are granted entry to the Open, and Woosnam's best chance probably lies there, although he already has some ground to make up. The Welshman was a late starter in the first round yesterday and must complete it today but, with one hole left to play, he is already three over having hit a quadruple-bogey eight at the 10th hole. Others on the lists for final qualifying are two Ryder Cup captains, Sam Torrance, who has already said he will not play next week because of a knee injury, and Mark James, who is not playing here, along with Jarmo Sandelin and Miguel Jimenez, both former Ryder Cup players. Though Els caught fire after the rain delay to record seven birdies with a superlative display of putting, he did point to a couple of errant tee shots on his second nine, though neither of them cost him strokes against par. He said that hitting balls and playing company days last week, in between long sessions in his swimming pool at his Wentworth home and a bit of time in the gym, had helped him maintain the game he had worked hard to establish after he was affected by a wrist injury this year. \"I put so much work into it before the US Open and you don't want to let your game go. I didn't feel too foreign out there today,\" he said. Els started this season in blistering form, winning his first two tournaments and four of the first six. But if he thinks his wrist injury was cruel after such a superb run, it was nothing compared with David Howell's problems. He broke an arm when he tripped while jogging in 2002 and missed 11 weeks of action. Then this year he sustained a shoulder injury, which cost him another seven weeks. His form has been slow to reappear but it has improved in recent weeks and a five- under 66 yesterday left him in second place. Hard work and a change of coaches, from Peter Cowen to Clive Tucker, helped resurrect his career and right now he stands seventh on that order of merit which will earn Open spots. \"I've been a pro for eight years and have not quite achieved what I thought I should. The changes were overdue,\" said the 28-year-old from Swindon. A quartet lodged on four under par after rounds of 67 included Phillip Price, who can do little wrong these days. Fresh from his triumph in the European Open at the K Club on Sunday, the Welshman found his putter in obedient mode yesterday. One of his birdies came from 45 feet away and he also rolled in a couple of 15-footers as he proved that his K Club success has left him hungry for more. He proceeded in his quietly efficient way to finish beside the Australians Peter O'Malley and Terry Price and the South African Martin Maritz."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
