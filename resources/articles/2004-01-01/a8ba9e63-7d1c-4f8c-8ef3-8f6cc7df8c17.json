I grew up in Egypt, during the war - an only child who was not sent to school. My home education centred entirely upon reading: the Bible, Homer by way of Andrew Lang's Tales From Troy and Greece, The Arabian Nights, alongside Dickens and Oscar Wilde when we ran out of recommended texts. A handful of children's books, from Alice to Swallows and Amazons. Palgrave's Golden Treasury of Verse, Macaulay's Lays of Ancient Rome. I read and reread, and what I read informed the stories that I then made up and acted out, the refuge of the solitary child. The garden, with its eucalyptus and casuarina trees, its hoopoes and chameleons, became the backdrop to a personalised version of the Homeric story, in which I had a starring role - Penelope - updated for the times with Achilles' tank armoured for him by the gods and Helen upstaged by the more resourceful (and, of course, more beautiful) Penelope. I would have been about nine, and my grasp on the distinction between fiction and reality was weak: the two became satisfyingly merged, and I never noticed that I did not have anyone to play with. Writers can spring from any seedbed. You do not need a book-oriented childhood in order to become a writer. I did not write and publish until I was well into my 30s, and by the time I did so 25 years of reading had formed a climate of mind: the books arose from that. Much else came into it, naturally - experience and observation and opinion, but it did somehow seem as though the business of being a fervent reader had simply nudged me one step further. I had never had writing ambitions. No writing courses or creative writing MAs back in the 1950s. I was married to an academic; the only writers I knew wrote history or philosophy. A novelist, to me, was an exotic figure: Iris Murdoch was a fellow of the Oxford college to which I went, but I was too much in awe of her ever to address her, and anyway at that point it had never crossed my mind to consider writing as an occupation. I fell into it, years later, almost by accident, it now seems. I tried my hand at a book, and it was published - against all the odds. That was more than 30 years ago. Reading still powers what I write. Sometimes in a very direct way - books will provide essential background material when I am stepping quite outside personal experience or the capacities of unaided imagination. I have needed lately to know about the battle of the Imjin river, about Iron Age hillforts, about torpedo sinkings in the second world war: books, books, books. But it is the great swath of uncontrived serendipitous reading that is equally important: from there the lightning may strike. History, archaeology, anthropology, biography, popular science. Fiction, poetry. Anything, pretty well; some of it sought out, some of it fortuitous. I have several books on the go at any one time, something for every mood, every inclination. Every now and then one of these will strike a chord: I will know that I have been waiting for this. Short stories are prompted by life as it is lived: something seen, something heard. A novel comes from there, too, but also from elsewhere, from thoughts, interests, preoccupations. In some way that does not bear too close examination when you are actually doing it, these turn themselves into characters, a setting, a story. There is much scrawling in notebooks, much staring out of the window: eventually, a shape emerges, rather, I imagine, as a sculptor wrestles a form out of the lump of rock. Then you can get going, embark on the long haul of construction and refinement. Books beget books. Each reader's engagement with a book is different: every book is subject to a myriad different readings. Equally, engagement with a book, or a writer, changes over time; you can fall in and out of intimacy, as with a friend. I used to read Barbara Pym with pleasure; now, I do not. Lawrence Durrell exasperated me in the past; today, I enjoy him. But there is also a slew of books that are an abiding solace, because they remind me of what the novel can do at its heights: Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier, William Golding's The Inheritors, Henry James's What Maisie Knew, various others. I go back to them for a shot in the arm, just as I depend on that continuing flow of haphazardly encountered books that will perform as fuel for the imagination. \u00b7 Penelope Lively's latest novel is The Photograph (Penguin)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
