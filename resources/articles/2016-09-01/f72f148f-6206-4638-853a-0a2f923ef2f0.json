The signatories are headed by Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, who will give a speech on Monday in front of an audience of faith leaders and refugees to reiterate the letter\u2019s demands. Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, the former lord justice of appeal, has added her name to the letter, which is also signed by leaders and representatives of the Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist communities. \u201cAs people of faith, we call on your government to urgently revise its policy towards refugees,\u201d the letter says. \u201cThe best of this country is represented by the generosity, kindness, solidarity and decency that Britain has at many times shown those fleeing persecution, even at times of far greater deprivation and difficulty than the present day. We rejoice in the mosaic of different faiths and British communities that we now represent.\u201d It adds: \u201cIn the face of the unfolding human catastrophe, there are immediate and viable steps that the government can take to offer sanctuary to more refugees. We call on you to create safe, legal routes of travel, for example by adopting fair and humane family reunion policies for refugees.\u201d According to Williams, \u201cthe sheer scale of the refugee crisis has the capacity to paralyse us\u201d. Allowing relatives of refugees already in Britain to join them would offer \u201ca practical route for responding to the pressure of the human suffering we see\u201d, he told the Guardian. \u201cPeople admitted as family members are guaranteed a ready-made network, a human support system here \u2013 so that we are not talking about an influx of rootless or alienated individuals, vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the greatest tragedies of the current appalling situation is the shattering of family life as a result of displacement and insecurity.\u201d Calls have been mounting for the government to do more to bring unaccompanied refugee children in Calais to Britain. Some 220 children have been identified as having the legal right to be reunited with families, yet only 50 have been allowed to enter the UK. A campaign by the beneficiaries of Kindertransport, the programme to rescue thousands of Jewish children from the Nazis, has raised more than \u00a350,000 in a week to help pay legal costs and support children in Calais. Last week, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, raised the issue of unaccompanied children in Calais in the House of Lords. Addressing the home office minister Susan Williams, he said: \u201cDoes the minister not agree that where children \u2013 particularly young ones \u2013 have families in this country there is no reason why they should not be brought across within the day?\u201d One of the signatories of Monday\u2019s interfaith letter, Rabbi Herschel Gluck, said: \u201cBeing the son of refugees from Hitler, who lost over 100 of their close family members because of the lack of compassion and vision with regard to family reunification by the authorities at that time, I feel especially obliged to help ensure that we don\u2019t repeat those mistakes.\u201d Qari Muhammad Asim, the chief imam of the Makkah mosque in Leeds, said: \u201cMany refugees with close family members in the UK are risking their lives trying to escape deplorable conditions in camps and reunite with their families. Many lives could be saved if safe legal routes were secured by the government.\u201d Present policies were failing unaccompanied refugee children in Calais, said Peter Hill, the bishop of Barking. \u201cThe system is broken ... At the current rate of reunification it will take a year before all the children in Calais are reunited with their families. This is forcing children to take matters into their own hands on rail tracks, stowing away in lorries and putting themselves into the hands of unscrupulous people traffickers. How can a civilised country allow this to continue?\u201d The interfaith letter follows similar initiatives by 350 judges and lawyers, who wrote to the then prime minister, David Cameron, last October; 120 senior economists in January; and 27 humanitarian and refugee organisations, also in January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
