In the last general election, Labour experienced a significant increase in the number of young supporters \u2013 with 60% of voters aged 18-24 voting for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party. While some MPs worry that this poll will fall at an awkward time for students, when many have travelled home for Christmas, almost a third of the 316,264 voter registration applications submitted within two days of its announcement were under 25. We want to hear from first-time and young voters ahead of the general election. How to contribute We are interested in hearing from people aged 18-24 about their feelings towards this election. Have you registered to vote? Have you decided who to vote for? Will you be voting tactically? Are you campaigning, and if so, how? Or maybe you\u2019ve decided not to vote at all.
