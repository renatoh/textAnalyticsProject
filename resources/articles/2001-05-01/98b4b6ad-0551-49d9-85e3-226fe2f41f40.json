In line with British parliamentary convention, the main parties stand aside to give that candidate a free run back to Westminster. It is a tradition Carolyn Leckie has no time for. Coia's Caf\u00e9 is on Glasgow's Duke Street, which runs east from the city centre and divides two of Scotland's most impoverished constituencies. To the south is Shettleston; to the north is Springburn, represented by Speaker Michael Martin. Inside the caf\u00e9, Leckie, who will fight the seat for the Scottish Socialist Party, argues that the people of Springburn should be given a choice. 'They should not be denied their democratic right,' she says. 'This area has one of the highest poverty rates in Europe. In Springburn 60 per cent of children are born into poverty.' Leckie knows she cannot win on 7 June. Four years ago, before he became Speaker, Martin won the seat with a majority of 17,326 and he remains popular. Indeed the area is represented in the Scottish Parliament by his son, Paul. The tradition of not standing against the Speaker allows him or her to retain that position through the election and with it the party-political impartiality the post demands. The pecularity of the current situation arises largely from the fact that the Speaker's constituency is in Scotland and is therefore exposed to the challenge of parties that advocate a break from the Westminster system. The Scottish National Party is also putting forward a candidate. Leckie, Unison's North Glasgow branch secretary, says the interests of the poor must be represented and she argues that the Labour Party is not doing this. 'They are not concerned about the issues affecting people's lives. Labour has become a party of big business. It is no coincidence that company directors write to the Times pledging their support for Blair. He is their Prime Minister.' Tommy Sheridan launched the SSP's manifesto last week, promoting policies which include pledges to introduce a national mini mum wage of at least \u00a37 an hour, a basic state pension of \u00a3150 a week and the restoration of the link between pensions and earnings. It also wants the private pensions industry brought into the public sector and cuts in top-rate taxation to be reversed. Such pledges might seem far-fetched compared with other manifestos, but the suggestion that the economy might not be able to afford large increases in public spending is met with scorn. 'We're not asking for much,' says Leckie. 'Our aims are modest. We want taxation taken back to the level it was in the early Thatcher years. We find it appalling that before 1997 the top rate of taxation was 63 per cent. Now it is 40 per cent. This move would double the annual budget available for Scotland.' The party also believes in the legalisation of cannabis and wants to make heroin available on prescription. In an area that is home to a huge number of drug addicts, some people have suggested the SSP policy would merely compound the problem. 'That's just nonsense,' says Leckie. 'The current policy is the one that isn't working. Drug deaths are on the increase. A new approach is required to break the link between the drugs and the dealers. The policy of making heroin available on prescription was successfully adopted in Switzerland recently. 'But while everyone thinks of drugs as one of the main issues facing Springburn, the feedback we are getting at public meetings is that people have other concerns. This is one of the sickest constituencies in Europe and Stobhill hospital is to be closed down. These are the things that people are coming to us about.' A diner at an adjacent table overhears the conversation and says he supports the SSP. 'They're the only ones standing up for the working class,' he says, before taking posters from the candidate to stick up in his window. The posters will be seen not only by voters but by the many people in the constituency who have no say in this election but are seeking political asylum in the UK. Conservative calls for Britiain to be a 'safe haven not a soft touch' thrust asylum- seekers back to the top of the agenda on Friday. Appalling attacks on asylum-seekers in the Sighthill area of Glasgow Springburn have shocked Scots, and while they have been carried out by small groups of teenagers Leckie points the finger at politicians. 'When MPs are promoting blatantly racist policies, what can we expect? The anger that has built up as a result of poverty is directed at the wrong people, thanks to a right-wing consensus.' The Scottish Socialists are standing in all 72 seats, but know they cannot hope to take any and admit that they will lose many deposits. The election for them is about building a base for the next Holyrood vote, where the more proportional representative system offers greater scope for the smaller parties. 'We will not win Springhill, but hopefully we can run the SNP close,' says Leckie. 'The real choice is between a failing economic system that the rest support and socialism. We are offering real change at a time when you can't get a sheet of toilet paper between the Tories and Labour.'
