As a result, we see her coming to terms with the fact that her cancer is incurable after nine malignant tumours are discovered in her liver. Her partner Ryan O'Neal goes with her as she seeks treatments when chemotherapy has failed. Fawcett is very likable, showing bravery and humour when facing up to her encroaching mortality, but the emotional manipulation and excess of sentiment in the way this is presented is off-putting. BBC Proms 2009 8pm, BBC2 Almost-live coverage of the 115th Proms \u2013 each note will issue through your television speakers roughly half an hour after it has been played at the Royal Albert Hall. The BBC Symphony Orchestra will present a programme including Elgar, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky and Brahms, under the baton of Czech-born Jir \u02c7\u00ed Be \u02c7lohl\u00e1vek. Also appearing are the Irish soprano Ailish Tynan, the British mezzo-soprano Alice Coote, British/Australian pianist Stephen Hough, and French piano duo Katia and Marielle Lab\u00e8que. Clive Anderson presents. As Seen On TV 8.30pm, BBC1 Steve Jones chairs this quiz themed on the TV archives, with Fern Britton and Jason Manford captaining two teams of celebrity guests, whose calibre this week runs to Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen and Pauline Quirke. Unable to decide whether it's edgily hip or comfortably staid, it includes items such as a human beatboxer rendering theme tunes, alongside a straightforward steal of the \"What happened next?\" bit from A Question of Sport. True Blood 10pm, FX Six Feet Under creator Alan Ball sticks with the dark side for his brand new show, but this time he's all about the living dead. Its clever premise is that vampires now live openly among people, fighting for their civil rights and surviving, supposedly, on bottles of synthetic Tru Blood. Though spotting these quirks is a pleasure in its own right, this is more than just an excuse for canny satire. It's a stylish, slick and moreish feast of soapy drama, with an excellent (and Emmy-winning) lead in Anna Paquin as telepathic waitress Sookie Stackhouse. In the States, the premiere of the second series earned HBO its highest ratings since the final episode of The Sopranos."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
