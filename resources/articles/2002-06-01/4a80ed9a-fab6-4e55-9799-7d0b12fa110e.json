The former Wimbledon semi-finalist turned semi-tennis-player has, by the size of her bank balance, spurred some of her compatriots on to escape a drab existence, but yesterday she went out in the first round of a tournament for the 10th time this year. This time the Muscovite millionairess lost 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 to Tatiana Panova, a fellow Russian with nowhere near as much natural ability but with a better focus. Yet while Kournikova's ranking continues to plummet, her earnings still move in the other direction. She now seems to have reached a point where her off-court activities, including modelling and being a walking endorsement of, among other things, Berlei bras and Pegasus cellphones, have overtaken any tennis ambitions she may have had. Tennis is becoming simply a means to an end. She has gone out in the first round of three grand slams this year: the Australian Open, the French Open and now Wimbledon. There has never been a marketing phenomenon like this in tennis. Andre Agassi came close through a long association with Nike and the slogan \"image is everything\" but his sport always came first. John McEnroe was involved in humorous advertisements for Dunlop rackets, and Venus Williams currently has a deal with Reebok said to be worth $40m but with no suggestion yet that she is likely to relinquish the world No1 spot. No one, it seems, has gone through the strange gamut of emotions that Kournikova is currently enduring. Extraordinarily wealthy and inordinately famous, but is she a success? The evidence of an interview just before Wimbledon suggests she does not feel she is. \"There comes a point where I can't be concerned because I just don't know what to think any more,\" she said. \"I am trying to get through this, to play through this, but I have lost that sense of what I should do at what point in the match. \"There are some other things which are happening in my life, so it may be part of that. After losing all those matches I think I need to work.\" She later contradicted herself. \"Maybe if I stop practising so much it will turn around,\" she said, adding: \"It's hard to go through this.\" There is doubt in her mind, and it is affecting both her tennis and her wellbeing. There were times yesterday when she seemed to be reverting to her old role as a half-decent player, but she just could not concentrate. There were strangely limp moments - two successive double faults which ended the sixth game and the double fault that contributed to the only break in the final set. Yet for a while she threatened to turn the match around by going for broke. When that happened the crowd responded noisily and she showed what she might still be capable of. There were enterprising advances to the net, fierce winners and two delicious drop-shots, but her reaction was strange. She grinned, and twice she even laughed. They were not the reactions of someone whose mind was entirely on her work. Rather it was of a 21-year-old who was no longer sure what was important to her, of an identity confused and maybe of a commodity exploited. But Kournikova was in denial about the commercial distractions. \"I don't have a career off court,\" she said later. \"There's no two Annas, there's one Anna.\" She added: \"If I wasn't 100% committed to playing I wouldn't be here. I'm not involved in a lot of stuff like you guys say. I don't have a career off court. \"But there have been other changes in my life in general. I am trying to come back from injury and I am changing in every way, me as a person, me in my life, the purpose of everything. I am 21 and trying to become my own person and doing it in front of everyone.\" All this could not detract from the No21 seed Panova's worthy performance. Contrast, too, the situation of Anastasia Myskina, a childhood friend of Kournikova's who came from the same club. She has reached two finals in the past two weeks, came back from a sluggish start to win 2-6, 6-1, 7-5 against Denmark's Eva Dyrberg and is within one place of becoming the highest-ranked Russian and five of becoming the only Russian in the top 10. Yet she is almost unknown.
