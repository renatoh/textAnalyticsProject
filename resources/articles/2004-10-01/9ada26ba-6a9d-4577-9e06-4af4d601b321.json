I have have performed eight same-gender marriage ceremonies in the past nine years. All but one of the couples are still happily married (the one exception being due to a tragically early death). Two of the couples now have children. These marriages are recognised by God and by all people of good faith. The fact that the state lags behind the understanding of God is hardly something new. But the time will come when opinions like Ms Newton's will be viewed with as much puzzlement as we now regard the beliefs of those who used scripture to justify slavery. Rabbi Roderick Young London Of course Christians believe that marriage is a sacrament, but \"marry\" is also an English word, and is perfectly applicable to same-sex relationships with the appropriate degree of commitment. Trevor Bench-Capon West Kirby, Wirral I am perturbed by Thomas Larque's assertion (Letters, October 22) that \"all that it would take to make gay marriage legal and right in Britain is a vote in parliament\". Legal, yes - but right? If parliament really claims the power to make right what was not right before, I'll take a theocracy any day. Most priests at least claim to follow moral authority more consistent than that offered by majority opinion.
