The European federation has charged the Football Association with fan misconduct and England risk being ordered to play their next qualifier, against Slovakia on June 11 at Middlesbrough, behind closed doors. Uefa's disciplinary commission meets on May 1 with Caborn pleading the FA's anti-racism record in mitigation. He said: \"Such incidents are very disappointing but the FA and many other bodies have worked with fans to take racism out of football and that should be recognised. \"A small minority has brought our game into disrepute again and it is for all fans to stand up and say they do not want these hooligans and racist thugs in the game. A lot has been achieved through Kick It Out, and Show Racism the Red Card, but we cannot take our foot off the gas.\" The charge, following another for the pitch invasions by England fans during the same game, followed an official complaint from the Turkish federation. The FA has until April 21 to submit a response. Slovakia suffered a closed-doors punishment because their supporters racially abused England players last October though Uefa has said a similar punishment for England is by no means automatic. Disciplinary proceedings have also been instigated against Turkey for the improper conduct of players in the tunnel after the match. MPs are to hold an official investigation into football's finances. The all-party Parliamentary Football Group will investigate spiralling player costs, increased debt, the impact of transfer windows, uncertainty over TV revenues and the growing gap between top clubs and the rest. Alan Keen, the Labour MP for Feltham who chairs the group, said: \"Football is part of the nation's heritage but, despite its increased popularity, there are serious financial problems at the professional end of the game. The grassroots could be affected as well as the professional game if the wrong decisions are made. \"We hope to gather together the joint wisdom of all those involved in the game at all levels.\" The inquiry, which will also consider the potential for conflict between fans and shareholders of clubs listed on the Stock Exchange, will publish its findings in the autumn. Derby County have given another indication that their suspended manager, John Gregory, will not be returning to Pride Park by re-employing another person sacked by him. Rod Thomas has been appointed director of football months after losing his job as a scout when Gregory reorganised the department. Billy McEwan, dismissed by Gregory as coach in February, has already been re-employed. George Burley, Derby's interim manager, expects a decision on his future next week. He was appointed for an initial two-week period after Gregory's suspension a fortnight ago and today's game away at Wimbledon was due to be his last. Everton are to look for another new home after scrapping plans yesterday to move to King's Dock. Bill Kenwright, Everton's deputy chairman, said: \"We will work closely with the city council to deliver the first-class stadium our supporters want and deserve.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
