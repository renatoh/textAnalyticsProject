The Treasury select committee said that it backed Bailey to become the new governor, saying they were satisfied he had \u201cthe professional competence and personal independence to be appointed\u201d. But the MPs criticised the performance of the Financial Conduct Authority, which he ran for almost four years. In an unprecedented conclusion following a near three-hour grilling in parliament, the committee said it would monitor closely the culture, operations and transparency of the FCA. This followed damning criticisms of the watchdog by consumer and industry groups during Bailey\u2019s tenure as its chief executive. MPs on the committee said there was \u201ca gap between public expectations and the current powers and performance\u201d of the FCA, which Bailey heads until 16 March. Mel Stride, chair of the committee, said: \u201cThe committee has approved Andrew Bailey\u2019s appointment, but it has also raised a number of serious concerns regarding the performance of the FCA both before and during his time as its CEO. \u201cMany of these concerns will remain a key focus for the committee. The committee is clear that it has an important role in improving the performance of the FCA. We will be holding a rigorous pre-appointment hearing with the new chief executive to consider further the issues raised in yesterday\u2019s session.\u201d As governor, Bailey will chair the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, which sets the UK\u2019s interest rate policy, and oversee the financial policy committee and the Prudential Regulation Authority, which between them monitor the activities of City banks and safeguard Britain\u2019s financial system. Bailey was picked for the job by former chancellor Sajid Javid, in almost his last act before his resignation. Andy Haldane, the current chief economist at the bank, was believed to be the preferred candidate of Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings. Haldane has a reputation for \u201cfree thinking\u201d in his views of monetary policy, while Bailey was regarded as a \u201csafe pair of hands\u201d. MPs voiced their criticism following a wide-ranging hearing on Wednesday to consider Bailey\u2019s suitability as governor. Bailey, who worked at the Bank of England for 30 years before joining the FCA, defended his time in charge of the watchdog despite a series of scandals on his watch. He said on each occasion, the FCA was hindered by constraints on its powers to act or legal delays that the regulator could not control. Critics have reprimanded Bailey for slow progress in investigating the treatment of business customers by RBS and Lloyds, as well as for its handling of the failed investment firm London Capital &amp; Finance. A lack of supervision of Neil Woodford\u2019s flagship investment fund, which collapsed owing investors millions of pounds, has also been pinned on Bailey by consumer groups. He said he was \u201cnot proud of some of the things that happened during my time\u201d, but the watchdog had changed for the better under his leadership. He said a crackdown on payday lenders had saved low-paid families billions of pounds. \u201cIt\u2019s hellishly tough at times, but that\u2019s the nature of it,\u201d he said of the job. \u201cI don\u2019t regret it for a moment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
