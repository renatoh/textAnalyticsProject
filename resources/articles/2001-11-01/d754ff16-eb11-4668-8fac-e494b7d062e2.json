The supermarket giant said it would be introducing hundreds of new products and cutting the price of many existing lines. To meet demand, Tesco issued a \"clear challenge\" to British farmers to grow more organic produce to help fill its shelves. The company currently imports about 80% of its organic range. National Farmers' Union president Ben Gill welcomed today's announcement, but called for extra help from the government. \"This is a great opportunity for British farmers who are obviously looking to develop their business in the light of recent crises. \"I am confident that our members are up to the challenge not only to maintain but also to greatly increase the share that goes to UK farming. \"However, they will need support from others, including government, if more farms are to convert to organic production.\" The organic range at Tesco is now worth \u00a3200m, up from \u00a330m when the products were introduced in 1997. The target of \u00a31bn by 2006 will account for at least 5% of all the food Tesco sells. The company added a number of new lines to its Organics range last month, including honeynut cornflakes, digestive biscuits, beef lasagne, frozen breaded chicken steaks, and lemonade lollies. It has just introduced savings on 50 products across the range. Terry Leahy, Tesco chief executive, said: \"Our organic sales have been strong across the board but now customers from all walks of life - particularly price-sensitive families - are telling us that they want to buy more organic food. \"They also tell us the main barriers preventing them from buying more are availability and affordability.\" He added: \"Today's commitment to expand the organic market will help by giving farmers the confidence to invest in the future.\" Sue Flook from the Soil Association said: \"Any move to expand the organic market is welcome but they must have a British-first policy.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
