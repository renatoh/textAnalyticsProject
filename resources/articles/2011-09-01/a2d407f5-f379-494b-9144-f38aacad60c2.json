First, that the misfortunes of a lone penguin captured news interest around the globe, then that $30,000 (\u00a319,000) was lavished on his return to health, and then, that despite all of this love, the penguin, dubbed Happy Feet, is probably dead. Following a release back to the wild, the tagging signal from the world's favourite flightless bird has disappeared, leading to speculation about his death at the jaws of a superior aquatic mammal. At least one wildlife expert had some perspective: \"It is time to harden up to the reality that the penguin has returned to the anonymity from which he emerged,\" he said.

No comment on whether doling out state honours to headline grabbing celebrities was \"jumping the shark\". The tweet @iamkelis \" \u2026 racial issues in the uk are disgusting. Its racially decades behind progression because everything is swept under the rug. People don't talk about it. People don't fight about it.\" Following an alleged racist verbal assault at a London airport, US singer Kelis gives her thoughts on race relations in the UK."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
