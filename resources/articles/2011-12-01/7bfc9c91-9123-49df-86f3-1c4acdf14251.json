No wonder Fiennes wanted his escape route door left open. K Cowan Teddington, Middlesex It was satisfying, in a strange way, to see silly questions asked of a male celebrity, it being the norm for any famous woman over 35 to be asked when she's going to settle down. KrustytheKlown On theguardian.com I was on Fiennes's side until he made the classic actor's mistake of believing his job actually makes a difference. Art is important but, \"To give of yourself as a performer has the same value as making a house\" is just not true. On any level. BigbadD On theguardian.com Plenty of playwrights, designers, writers, etc (Make You Sick, Don't They?), but where were the scientists and engineers? Philip Strange Totnes, Devon If we ignore the \"entrepreneur\" James Simpson (who just had to tell us how much he's worth), not one of your bright young things works in the financial services sector. Perhaps there's hope for us yet? Alan Gent Cheadle, Cheshire James Simpson: \"In the next 10 years, I'd like to be in the top 50 of the main Sunday Times rich list.\" *vomits* BrokenFace On theguardian.com Is it really \"over-achieving\" for a cricketer or DJ to be at the top of their game before the age of 40? Constantinex On theguardian.com Tristram Hunt says his success is down to hard work, and then goes on to describe his upbringing. It's the typical delusional contradictions of the privileged middle class. What's opportunity, stability, love, support, healthy role models and a sense of entitlement got to do with it? rah90 On theguardian.com Sport, James Taylor, 21, cricketer. See also: Rory, Jack, Tom, Lewis, Andr\u00e9. But don't see even one of: Rebecca, Kerri-Anne, Jessica, Beth. What was the Guardian saying about the Sports Personality of the Year's gender mix? oommph On theguardian.com The article about rape in the US military was horrifying, but not that surprising. Can we stop automatically depicting soldiers as \"heroes\" and realise that if you're trained to kill, it brutalises you? pollystyrene On theguardian.com If these guys are doing this to their comrades and getting away with it, imagine what they are doing to men, women and children they consider their enemy. Boilinghotfrog On theguardian.com The biggest shock is that reported rape is dealt with \"in house\" by the US military. If young, impressionable soldiers know they are above domestic laws, what's to stop them doing what they want, be it raping a fellow soldier or abusing prisoners? madnuns On theguardian.com As the atheist parents of a child whose local state primary is a church school, we will not be faking it. But while we don't believe, we do respect those who do. Robin Farquhar and Hannah Dipper Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire Your blind dates should ask each other another question: \"But what, exactly, do you do in your job?\" Last week we had a media manager and a marketing planner. Graham Webb Eastbourne When I'm picked for a blind date, I will arrange a day off work the next day, and would expect my date to do the same. That might make the answers to, \"Did you go on somewhere?\" a bit more interesting. Rosie Kitchen King's Lynn, Norfolk \u2022 Got something to say about an article you've read in Guardian Weekend?
