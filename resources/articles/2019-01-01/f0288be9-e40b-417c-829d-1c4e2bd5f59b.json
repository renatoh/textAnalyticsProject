It\u2019s a pretty cool time of year to reflect on the year that\u2019s been. It becomes a launching pad of what\u2019s to come.\u201d Over coffee in a Brunswick cafe, AFLW player Melissa Hickey shows me the pages of her 2019 diary. \u201cThis is a really cool diary, I had the same one last year. It gives you each week to plan. You\u2019ve got your priorities, your weekly goals, gratitude and your habits you\u2019re trying to bring in for the week. It kind of gets you to check yourself. It\u2019s a values based thing, it makes me think about what I prioritise. Footy is always number one.\u201d The 2018 AFLW season was cruel to Hickey. She suffered a devastating ACL injury and was forced to watch her Melbourne Demons narrowly miss the opportunity to play in the AFLW grand final from the sidelines. As she sets her goals for 2019, her year couldn\u2019t look more promising. A new club, coming back strong from injury and as she prepares to take the reins in her new role as the inaugural captain of the Geelong Cats AFLW team, and she\u2019s already ticking off some of her goals in her diary. \u201cI really wanted to be the captain or vice-captain at Geelong, that was almost like a goal I set for myself, so in some ways I was doing it from just being me from day one at the club. I just hoped that resonated with the playing group.\u201d As Hickey enters her tenth year of playing the game, she\u2019s self-aware and astute to the role she wants to play at Geelong from the lessons she\u2019s learned in her football journey. \u201cI hope my style of leadership is to really try to empower people. I think I was a lot more individually focussed in the past about my goals, a premiership was always number one, but then I wanted to get All Australian and Best and Fairest and stuff like that. That doesn\u2019t drive me so much anymore, it would be amazing, but it\u2019s not really my focus. \u201cThere\u2019s an extra sense of pressure there now because the captain has to perform. First and foremost you have to be playing well and I\u2019m probably someone who leads by example in that regard. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be my pre-game speeches that get us over the line!\u201d The last 12 months have also been a time of personal transition and growth for Hickey whose challenges were not just restricted to the field. In some tough times, she\u2019s been able to develop her resilience as she focusses on the next stage in her football career and her life. She\u2019s also learnt that no matter how many goals and plans you can write down in your diary, you can\u2019t control everything. \u201cWhen my long-term partner and I broke up, before that I thought I had everything planned out. Everything was pretty set and it was almost like, someone used this analogy with me, that you\u2019ve got your jigsaw puzzle and you\u2019re starting to put all the pieces together and then someone\u2019s come along and whacked it and so all the pieces kind of fell out.\u201d Hickey is excited to be looking forward to the possibilities a new year can bring. \u201cNow it\u2019s kind of cool to think, well I\u2019ve almost got a blank canvas again and think, what do I want to do? What actually feels right for me and what fulfils me which sometimes you can lose in a long-term relationship. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve had so much growth because I\u2019ve had so many challenges and been uncomfortable and then I did my knee. So it\u2019s been a year of learning, sometimes you just can\u2019t control things, shit just happens and then you have to have the ability to bounce back from that or find the meaning in that. \u201cIt\u2019s a yin and yang pull, it\u2019s chaos and order. You can\u2019t always have order, sometimes you need to be in chaos.\u201d It is this perspective and emotional intelligence that will serve Geelong well by having Hickey as captain. Her experience in overcoming adversity has given her many tools to lead and inspire but it has also allowed her to identify how things that many might see as small or innocuous can contribute to someone else\u2019s resilience toolkit. \u201cI\u2019m working with one of the girls at the club to try to get her to accept compliments, just to say, \u2018thank you\u2019 if you get a compliment rather than deflecting it. Because there are stepping stones from that, self-belief comes from that. I look at her and think she\u2019s already a good footballer, just wait until she believes she is.\u201d These small moments, these interactions come from someone who was a leader long before they were given a captaincy title and despite having the captaincy as one of her goals, she\u2019s aware of her reasons for wanting it and why that\u2019s so important. \u201cI read and listen to a lot of stuff on leadership and they say that if you\u2019re leading for the purpose to be the leader then you\u2019re missing the point. You lead to help out your mates or because it\u2019s the right thing to do and if you\u2019re expecting anything back, you\u2019re not in it for the right reasons.\u201d As we finish up our coffee and I begin to make my way home, Hickey says she is going to stay at the cafe and take some time plan her week and reflect on what\u2019s been and what\u2019s to come. \u201cThat\u2019s just kind of my learnings from a full on twelve months. I can quite honestly say that something I thought at the time was one of the worst things to happen to me is now probably almost the best thing to ever happen to me because I\u2019ve gone back to being more who I am, back to my real self. I\u2019ve prioritised friendships and I\u2019ve got a lot more love in my life from that now and that freedom to be like, well, what do I want to do with my life? And you could meet someone next month who is the most incredible person in the world and that\u2019s exciting, and then footy is just there tracking along.\u201d I ask just as I\u2019m about to leave: \u201cDoes footy make everything better?\u201d She smiles. \u201cYeah it does. It\u2019s so cool like that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
