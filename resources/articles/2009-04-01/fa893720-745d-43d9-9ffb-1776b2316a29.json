The Gazzetta dello Sport said the American contacted organisers yesterday from Colorado, where is currently training. The Giro runs from 9-31 May. \"The recovery has been going well and the plan is to be there,\" Armstrong's spokesman Mark Higgins said. It will mark the first time Armstrong races in the Italian classic, considered cycling's second most important race after the Tour. Armstrong returned to racing at the start of 2009 after three-and-a-half years of retirement. He fell during the Vuelta of Castilla and Le\u00f3n in Spain on 23 March and had surgery two days later. A stainless steel plate and 12 screws were inserted into his shoulder to stabilise the broken collarbone. Armstrong is also planning to enter the Tour in July, although he is worried French doping officials may ban him for allegedly violating protocols during a recent drug test. The Giro was originally scheduled to pass through France briefly during the 10th stage, but organisers changed the route last week, citing problems with the high mountain roads and bad radio reception. Celebrating the race's 100th anniversary, Giro organisers have prepared a special route this year passing through most of Italy's major cities. The three-week race begins with a team time-trial along Venice's beach front and concludes with an individual race against the clock in Rome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
