So hats off to the Financial Services Authority. This time it has not only shut the stable door before the horse has bolted, it may have put the shutters in place before the horse has even arrived. The 'horse' in question is called 'account aggregation', a service that enables consumers to view all their on-line accounts on a single web page. This is already a huge business in the US, where an estimated 1 million people use it, and this type of service was poised to descend on the UK until the FSA intervened. Having raised a number of questions about the risks Involved, potential service providers have decided to take a step back to make doubly sure that they can offer a watertight product before taking the plunge. Account aggregation is simple and attractive. Today's consumer is doing more and more business online. In the US the average consumer is estimated to have between 12 and 15 different accounts spread between six and 10 financial institutions. The UK is fast heading the same way. So instead of having to flit from site to site, why not pull all this information together on one page? The technology that does this works like little software robot vacuum cleaners, scooping up personal information from various websites and bringing it back to a single site. 'Screen scraping' is the rather more derogatory term used for it. The information could be about bank accounts, credit cards, email accounts, share dealing or even air miles. Yodlee, one of the US market leaders, now has a client list that reads like a Who's Who of the American financial establishment. Its clients include 14 of the top 20 banks and four of the top five brokerages. Just two years ago, however, it was rather different. One of its top clients today, First Union, started by suing Yodlee. Like First Union, the banks initially saw account aggregation as a competitive challenge and viewed having their servers 'swept' by aggregators with distaste. But, having seen how much business portals such as AOL and MSN were getting, they made a U-turn. Things are shaping up the same way in the UK. The banks are not happy and online product providers such as Fidelity, Egg and Virgin, who are known to be keen to offer account aggregation services, are being held back while a number of legal questions are sorted out. One of the problems which the FSA has highlighted is that no matter how many safeguards you build in, in terms of encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection systems and 24-hour monitoring, account aggregation entails the use by a third party of someone's passwords or pin numbers. This, the FSA points out, has implications under various legislation, including the Computer Misuse Act and the Data Protection Act. Does giving an aggregator your passwords break the terms and conditions of your online account, rendering you liable for errors and frauds on the account? Andy Newton, a spokesman for the FSA, stresses that the agency has no powers of regulation in the account aggregation area and that they are not seeking such power. 'We are not warning people off, simply raising certain warning flags: questions people should ask themselves before they give their passwords away to a third party.' The FSA's cautionary note however, seems to have done the trick. 'We think it's a good idea and we want to offer it, but for the time being it has been put on the back burner while we consider the FSA announcement,' says Fidelity's Jo Roddan. 'We are not setting out to break the law, and there are a number of things to sort out,' she adds. 'We have the details up on our site,' says Camilla Beeson, communications manager at Virgin Money. 'But we are not actually running it for the time being. We are taking a responsible approach and liaising with the powers that be. 'But we are dying to launch our V-safe product, and it should be out by the end of the year. We believe it will revolutionise how people operate online.' Egg, meanwhile, confirms that it is 'looking at account aggregation very closely' but at present has no launch plans. Few doubt that account aggregation will come and will be as big in the UK as it is in the US. Then, as Anne Marie Martyn of web service provider My Money Adviser says: 'It will boil down to a question of who will I trust with my password.' Martyn's company is developing account aggregation for IFAs. 'The IFA is the only true aggregator of financial information on behalf of the client,' she argues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
