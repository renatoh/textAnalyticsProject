In truth it was game, set and match to Clermont long before the end, a flurry of three Leicester tries in the last 10 minutes sparing the visitors from one of the heaviest European beatings in their history. Had the Tigers sneaked a couple of bonus points in an almost farcically frantic finale it would have been more a result of French generosity than snarling English defiance. The belated revival failed to prevent Leicester conceding more points than in any of their previous Heineken Cup matches and suffering a fifth successive away defeat in all competitions, their worst sequence for 25 years. Clermont are not confident travellers either but there will have to be a startling turnaround at Welford Road on Saturday evening if England's domestic champions are to escape a pool which, also featuring the Ospreys, has a distinct undertow. The beastly side of the French club game may have resurfaced elsewhere over the weekend but there was an irresistibly savage beauty about some of Clermont's rugby in the first hour. When the Michelin men click into gear, few teams in Europe can live with them. Leicester looked badly underpowered for long periods. It is now three years since they have beaten anyone in France and their squad is not quite as deep as they would like. If there is to be revenge next week it will be a struggle to serve it colder than this. Sleet and snow flurries swept across the Auvergne before kick-off and the temperature was barely above freezing. Out on the right wing, Leicester's imported Wallaby, Lote Tuqiri, looked about as carefree as a goose-pimpled swimsuit model in Skegness in January. Clermont, though, blazed red hot. An early penalty from their supremely capable fly-half, Brock James, set the tone before a neatly worked blind-side raid between Alexandre Lapendry and Anthony Floch yielded a try for the former, a rangy flanker. A couple of Toby Flood penalties kept the margin respectable but the traffic was heavy and almost entirely one way. To stand any chance Leicester needed their main men to deliver and everyone to make their tackles. It was highly ominous, therefore, when a simple first-phase move off a lineout brought Napolioni Nalaga thundering into the midfield and the Fijian wing brushed aside the former All Black centre Aaron Mauger with embarrassing ease. Nalaga, who was last season's Top 14 player of the year after scoring 20 tries in 19 matches, kept going all the way to the line. The Tigers were mostly on survival rations thereafter. A 25-9 half-time deficit was a fair reflection of the gulf in class. Floch, who looks every inch the best full-back in France, weighed in with a sweetly struck drop-goal and supplied the scoring pass for Nalaga's second try, in the right-hand corner following another dazzling, multi-phase attack. The arrival of Leicester's Argentina prop, Marcos Ayerza, after the interval did little to stem the tide. Martin Castrogiovanni and Flood battled well but when they won possession, Leicester kicked the ball away too often, putting themselves back under the cosh. A sweeping break from Gonzalo Canale past the trailing Mauger would have yielded another score had Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie stayed on his outside and there was an increasingly desperate edge to the Tigers' forays forward. It was no surprise, consequently, when Scott Hamilton ventured upfield only for the ball to fall loose with Rougerie loitering. A quick transfer from Elvis Vermeulen sent Morgan Parra scampering for the line from 25 metres out and the scrum-half's momentum took him over. Even late consolation tries from Anthony Allen and Flood, the latter the product of a move which started 75 metres downfield, merely had the unfortunate effect of reawakening Clermont, who rumbled back up the other end to score a fifth try, through the Canadian lock Jamie Cudmore. That was cancelled out instantly, when a James fumble enabled Flood to send Jeremy Staunton scooting 50 metres for a third try, and the final play of the game almost produced a miraculous fourth, and with it two bonus points, when Nalaga took his time dealing with a loose ball. Bodies were strewn across the pitch at the final whistle. At Welford Road this weekend, the Tigers must attempt to diminish the impact of Parra and James. Even if they do so, however, qualification for the quarter-finals could prove beyond them.
