While public scrutiny of legal aid barristers is central to a transparent system, the thousands of legal aid solicitors who resemble public servants more than \"fat-cat lawyers\" deserve recognition. Qualified lawyers, including barristers, working in the 60 law centres in the UK earn an average salary of \u00a329,000. They provide free legal advice about homelessness, employment, immigration/asylum, disability rights and benefits to people who can't afford to hire a lawyer. Yet this service is threatened by cuts to the civil legal-aid budget. The \"legal aid gravy train\" myth must be dispelled to protect the future of those who uphold the ethos of social welfare law without the expensive price tag. Steve Hynes Law Centres Federation That senior advocates doing difficult, demanding and long-running criminal cases should earn net sums similar to others in senior posts in the public sector should come as no surprise. However, this should not obscure the fact that junior barristers doing shorter trials can often barely cover their costs, such is the impact of the squeeze on pay rates for public-service lawyers over the past 10 years. The result of this will be to drive the best lawyers away from acting for the public into private work for powerful corporations and individuals.
