HM Inspectorate of Constabulary said the delays by Devon and Cornwall police could result in children being put at risk of significant harm, and the causes needed to be tackled promptly. In one case flagged up by HMIC, a 13-year-old girl alleged she had been sexually assaulted by a woman with whom she had been in a relationship. There was a delay of 10 days before the investigating officer spoke to the complainant, and another two months passed before a suspect was arrested. The report said: \u201cDespite concerns about the victim\u2019s vulnerability to CSE [child sexual exploitation] being recorded on police systems several months before this \u2026there was still no evidence of a safeguarding or protective plan being implemented for the victim despite clear signs of her obvious vulnerability.\u201d Another case that worried inspectors involved a 12-year old boy who had been groomed for sexual exploitation by an adult family friend. The HMIC said the initial response to arrest the suspect and safeguard the victim was appropriate. But it added: \u201cThere was no evidence of any consideration being given to the wider risks posed by the suspect to other children. Despite police records showing the suspect had previously held a number of roles supervising children (including as a Scout leader, which he was asked to leave because he had taken children on trips without permission), no further investigation was undertaken to assess wider risks or to identify further potential victims.\u201d In a third case, a 14-year-old boy had been reported missing more than 40 times and had attempted suicide. Police records indicated that information had been shared with the local authority and the risk of CSE had been considered. But there was no evidence that any longer-term safeguarding plan had been considered to protect him from further harm. HMIC published an initial report on Devon and Cornwall police last year as part of a rolling programme of child protection inspections of all police forces in England and Wales. A post-inspection review was carried out in April 2016. In its report on this review, published on Wednesday, HMIC said the force had made some improvements in relation to how it recognised and responded to CSE and had introduced additional vulnerability training for all frontline staff. Wendy Williams, of HMIC, said: \u201cFollowing our second inspection, it was clear that Devon and Cornwall police is committed to improving how it protects children. We found examples of good practice in how it recognises and responds to child sexual exploitation, and its risk assessment of vulnerable children. \u201cHowever, the force still faces challenges which it must overcome to ensure children are protected in all areas. We found delays to child protection investigations, as well as delays in responding to cases where children were at risk of sexual exploitation. These delays can result in children being at risk of significant harm, and need to be addressed promptly.\u201d Det Sup Keith Perkin, head of public protection, said: \u201cWe are pleased that the HMIC has recognised clearly in their report our commitment to improving how we protect children, and that they are encouraged by the progress the force has made since they first visited us in 2015. \u201cThere are always areas to focus on and the report gives us clear direction on how we can further protect children; the good news is much of that work has already started. \u201cWe have provided training to over 2,000 frontline staff and continue to train more to ensure that the force can effectively respond to and investigate child protection concerns. We have also invited 50 officers into a central safeguarding team who will focus on and improve our assessment of risk to children; we also work closely with youth agency forums across the force to help us effectively intervene, sooner. \u201cDevon and Cornwall police have also agreed upon a new protocol which directly deals with children when it is necessary to keep them in custody after they have committed an offence; this new protocol will see us work with local partners to ensure these children are placed in appropriate accommodation wherever possible.\u201d Perkin added: \u201cWhilst this report is largely positive and we are already implementing a number of the recommendations made by HMIC, we are fully aware that there is more to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
