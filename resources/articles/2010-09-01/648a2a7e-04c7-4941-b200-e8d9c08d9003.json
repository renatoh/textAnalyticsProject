In 1967 I was principal of a diocesan school in the same city. On 7 June, as a spin-off from the Arab-Israeli war, the Anglican church and parsonage were burned, the Roman Catholic church was half burned and the school I ran lost about 500 window panes. The rationale was that British planes were said to have bombed Aqaba. Somebody changed Aqaba to the Kaaba. So something British (=Christian) had to burn. Twelve years later, the rebuilt church was burned again, and again rebuilt. So I can understand why I received a call yesterday; the lady's home was burned on both occasions. Christian minorities in many parts of the world are at risk. But this is not the only reason for preventing Pastor Terry Jones from fulfilling his stupid intention. When Bush and Blair went into Iraq, those of us who knew the Muslim world were appalled. Inevitably, their act would be perceived by millions as an attack on Islam. And now Blair says he might advocate war on Iran. Fifty million people. Book burning can lead to war. It is not the answer. But nor is the rubbishing of faith. Richard Dawkins does the British people no favours by his facile presumption that science has disproved religion. Most people of faith have no desire to defend the failings of the churches he attacks. But we cannot imagine a better aim and practice than loving our neighbour. And we are even called to love our enemy. For 20 years in Birmingham I have seen much of this, with church people, black, white and Asian, in the forefront of building up \"cohesion\", bringing together people of all races and faiths. Our own church, asked by the city to be the children's centre for the (mainly Pakistani) area, is filled daily by young families, mainly Muslims. Professor Dawkins would be a welcome visitor, and so would Pastor Jones. They would see many people living in harmony with mutual courtesy and restraint, and lots of children. We are called to seek peace proactively. No. Religion is too large an element \u2013 for good or for ill \u2013 to be discarded. The keys, especially for Christians, Muslims and agnostics/atheists, may be twofold: to learn understanding of the \"other\" and to persevere in relationship. Rev John Ray Birmingham \u2022\u2008Besides being a dogmatic expression of freedom, burning the Qur'an just so happens to be an Islamic tradition carried out by Muslims whenever a misprint is discovered or when a Qur'an becomes too worn to read. It was done by the second Caliph of Islam, Umar ibn al-Khattab (God be pleased with him). In other words, in the Islamic scholarly tradition, burning a holy book is actually a show of respect, and symbolically, has a completely opposite connotation than burning a holy book in the west. What else might Pastor Terry Jones have overlooked in his attempt to insinuate bigoted hatred? Well, this incident will most likely spark public curiosity across the globe. As a result, purchases of English-translated Qur'ans will rise, resulting in increased conversion rates to Islam (the rate quadrupled in the US after 9/11). Secondly, according to General David Petraeus, this Qur'an-burning will endanger US and Nato troops. Enraged Muslim Afghans unaware of the Islamic Qur'an-burning tradition will be further stirred to join the insurgency. So really, Pastor Jones, for your enemies and the people you're trying to provoke, it's a win-win situation. Maybe you're really an undercover Muslim. Then again, maybe you're just an idiot. God guide you. Basel Junayd Calgary, Alberta, Canada \u2022\u2008The torching of the Qur'an planned for the ninth anniversary of September 11 is despicable. It is disheartening that nine years on, we are still embroiled in a climate of political mistrust, uncertainty and resentment at a time when Muslims and non-Muslims alike need each other to extinguish the flames of fundamentalism raging in their midst, and settle painful and legitimate grievances. Islam is a peaceful religion, and such provocations are bound to fan anti-Muslim hatred, intensify the stereotypical image of Islam and act as a recruiting sergeant for jihadis.
