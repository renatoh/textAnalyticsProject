I knew the lower reaches of the Miners' Path above Penygwryd would be awash with drainage from Cwm Ffynnon and the southern flank of Glyder Fach, and so it proved to be. Sloshing through the sunlit deer grass, now red in the autumn sunshine, we soon came to the crest of that long and undulating ridge that falls due east from Glyder Fach. Hopes of a magnificent vista across Tryfan's east face to the lift of the sepia slopes of the Carneddau beyond the Ogwen valley were confounded as swirls of chill, grey mist blew across. We climbed the greasy rock-piles to Tryfan's summit and a gusting wind brought more than veils of cloud - the rain blew across from Cwm Idwal and the north faces of the Glyderau. The planned climb of the Bristly Ridge to the stony top of Glyder Fach was switched to a rapid return along the Miners' Path and over the soaking ridge-top. We did have, though, a few magic moments on the way down. The clouds parted to reveal flashing sunlight reflected on little Llyn Lockwood and the more distant Llyn Gwynant in its beautiful, burnished valley. Even further off, we caught a pink and gold glimpse of the shiny sands of Traeth Mawr and Cardigan Bay at Porthmadog. As we stopped in awe of that golden prospect, it was easy to claim it as a vision from a David Woodford canvas, a creation of that great Nant Ffrancon artist. A knowledgeable collector has described him recently as, \"a modern-day Constable\". Who could deny it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
