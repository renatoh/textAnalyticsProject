Mr Hume, the former leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and Mr Paisley, the veteran leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party (DUP), have traditionally topped the poll in Northern Ireland's European elections, with the UUP taking the province's third European seat. But their retirement could see a drop in support for their parties in next month's election, with Sinn F\u00e9in's Bairbre de Brun widely tipped to take Northern Ireland's second European seat from the SDLP. The Ulster Unionists, meanwhile, are hoping that their sitting MEP, Jim Nicholson, can out-poll the DUP's Jim Allister and re-establish them as Northern Ireland's most popular unionist party following their defeat in last year's assembly election. Launching Sinn F\u00e9in's campaign in Dublin this morning - the party is standing candidates in the Irish Republic as well as Northern Ireland - Gerry Adams said the elections were an opportunity for the Irish people to have \"truly national representation in the EU parliament for the first time\". \"Sinn F\u00e9in is working to bring about real change, in the peace process, in local communities and in presenting a viable alternative to the present direction of the European Union,\" he added. Like Northern Ireland's main unionists parties, Sinn F\u00e9in is opposed to the creation of an EU constitution, which it believes will lead to the \"further dilution of Irish sovereignty\". The UUP's Jim Nicholson similarly spoke out against the proposed EU constitution at his campaign launch this morning, describing it as \"yet another attempt to establish a European superstate\". While welcoming the government's commitment to a referendum on the constitution, he said he would oppose over-regulation and harmonisation measures in key areas where, he argued, Westminster would be the best judge. \"The people should have their say when it is agreed, not when it suits Labour's electoral interests,\" he said. \"An EU constitution might have been useful if it just consolidated existing treaties. In reality, it is yet another attempt to create an EU superstate.\" Mr Nicholson's manifesto also opposed any move to adopt the euro in the UK, arguing that it had had a negative impact on those countries that had already joined. The experience of Eurozone members such as the Irish Republic, he said, was that its adoption would be an excuse to raise prices, while other parts of Europe had seen unemployment rise as a consequence. He also said the surrender of control over interest rates, exchange rates and tax policy to Europe struck against the basic concept of democracy. Sinn F\u00e9in, meanwhile, was to launch its campaign in a series of meetings across Ireland, starting in Dublin this morning and ending in Belfast this afternoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
