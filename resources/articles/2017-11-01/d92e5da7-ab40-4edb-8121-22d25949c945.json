The first secretary of state, regarded as May\u2019s de facto deputy, will stand in for the prime minister, who is visiting Jordan. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, will take him on. Green has been chosen to fill in despite his political future hanging in the balance for several weeks while he is investigated by Sue Gray, the head of propriety and ethics in the Cabinet Office. The senior civil servant has been deliberating over claims that Green harassed a young Conservative activist and downloaded pornography to a work computer. He denies both allegations. The Cabinet Office declined to say whether the investigation had concluded or whether it would be made public when finished. Gray\u2019s inquiry was launched on 1 November after Kate Maltby, a Conservative activist and journalist, wrote an article claiming Green had touched her knee in 2015 and, a year later, sent her a suggestive message. Green said the claims were \u201cuntrue and deeply hurtful\u201d. It later emerged that pornography, allegedly of an \u201cextreme\u201d nature, had been found on Green\u2019s parliamentary office computer after a police raid in 2008. Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan police commissioner between 2009 and 2011, confirmed he was briefed about the pornography but regarded it as a \u201cside issue\u201d. He said he regretted that its existence was in the public domain. But Green has said his accusers had \u201culterior motives\u201d. \u201cI reiterate that no allegations about the presence of improper material on my parliamentary computers have ever been put to me or to the parliamentary authorities by the police,\u201d he said at the time. A Whitehall source confirmed to the Guardian last week that the inquiry had \u201crun its course\u201d and findings would be announced \u201csooner rather than later\u201d. May later defended her decision to nominate Green to stand in for her. Speaking to reporters while flying to Jordan she said: \u201cHe is the first secretary of state. He has deputised for me at prime minister\u2019s questions before. \u201cObviously, there are considerations, the continuing of these issues. But he\u2019s the first secretary of state, he\u2019s done prime minister\u2019s questions before and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll do a very good job.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
