Throughout the history of Super League they have made a habit of snatching victory when they could have easily lost, and the last two weeks have been no different; they could have come up short against Huddersfield last week as well as against Warrington here yet instead they\u2019ve beaten both at the death to move to the top of Super League. Once again they had to do it tough, losing their captain Jon Wilkin after eight minutes due to injury, but the vice-captain James Roby led from the front and inspired them to what could be a huge victory come the Super 8s in a few weeks\u2019 time after Jordan Turner\u2019s late try proved to be the difference. \u201cI\u2019d have taken the draw; I thought the game didn\u2019t deserve a loser at times - both teams were great for long periods,\u201d said the St Helens coach Keiron Cunningham. \u201cBut my lads never give up; I knew we\u2019d get a chance and although I wasn\u2019t sure if we\u2019d score it, I knew we\u2019d get a shot to win it.\u201d The game was again another fillip for Sky and their television selections; their last three televised matches in the past week have all been settled in the final two minutes \u2013 with the second half rightfully overshadowing a first period in which 16 penalties were awarded by the referee James Child. Warrington\u2019s participation in the Super 8s is still not secure following the defeat, but only a freakish combination of results and a minor miracle in terms of points difference would consign them to the qualifiers. They continue to be linked with a move for the half-back Chris Sandow ahead of the 24 July transfer deadline next week, and after another indifferent performance here their temptation to act in the transfer market could be growing by the day. \u201cWhatever will happen will happen,\u201d said the Warrington coach, Tony Smith, when asked about a move for Sandow. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a team here I\u2019m focused on and I\u2019m excited about the remainder of the season. If there\u2019s a chance of adding to the squad then that\u2019s exciting too \u2013 if it happens, it happens, but there\u2019s only a week until the deadline.\u201d Wilkin\u2019s departure to a hand injury after eight minutes rocked the Saints but they adjusted well, with Roby scoring the game\u2019s opening try after 15 minutes. That try came from back-to-back penalties, and two more in the following set allowed Luke Walsh to add a penalty on to his earlier conversion to make it 8-0, before a try from Ben Currie a minute before the break reduced the gap to just two points. The Warrington wing Kevin Penny then intercepted a long pass from Luke Walsh to put the home side in front after 50 minutes before the prop Mose Masoe showed why the NRL side St George have signed him for next season with a brilliant solo try to restore Saints\u2019 lead. A penalty from O\u2019Brien then levelled up matters with five minutes left to set up a thrilling finish, before Turner finished a superb break from the half-back Travis Burns to seal another dramatic victory for the Saints.
