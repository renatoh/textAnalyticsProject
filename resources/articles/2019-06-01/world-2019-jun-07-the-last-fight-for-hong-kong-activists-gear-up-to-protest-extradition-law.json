But the city\u2019s legislators are pushing ahead with the controversial extradition law that will give mainland China the right to request the transfer of alleged criminals. Opponents have geared up for a fight, with a rally on Sunday expected to draw up to half a million people onto the city\u2019s streets. The demonstration is supported by human rights and legal groups and the leaders of Hong Kong\u2019s movement to preserve its tenuous grip on democracy. They fear the law, which will have its second reading before the legislature next week, will be used by Beijing to target its political enemies. It has prompted despair from many, who worry it heralds the effective end of the city\u2019s independence from China. In its current form, the legislation would allow for case-by-case extraditions to mainland China and eliminate some oversight roles of the chief executive\u2019s cabinet and the city\u2019s legislative body. The legislature is seeking to pass it before the summer break in July. \u201cAll they need is a witness statement saying you committed some crime 20 years ago,\u201d says Martin Lee QC, a barrister, former legislator and leading pro-democracy figure. \u201cThat is enough, and then you\u2019ll be tried according to Chinese law in a Chinese court. And who can trust that system?\u201d Critics have accused the Hong Kong administration, led by Carrie Lam, of being \u201cBeijing\u2019s puppet\u201d. But Lam\u2019s administration claims the bill closes a legal loophole. It says the law \u2013 and the rush to pass it \u2013 is justified because of the case of a man wanted for the murder of his girlfriend in Taiwan. Eroding automony Hong Kong\u2019s independent legal system was protected under the laws governing the territory\u2019s return from British to Chinese rule 22 years ago and is seen by the financial hub\u2019s business and diplomatic communities as its strongest remaining asset amid encroachments from Beijing. But the city\u2019s independence \u2013 which is supposedly guaranteed until 2047 \u2013 has been slowly eroding, particularly since Xi Jinping took over as leader of the Communist Party in 2012. Last year, six members of the so-called \u201cpan-democrat alliance\u201d were expelled from parliament and pro-democracy candidates were disqualified from by-elections. Leaders and organisers of the 2014 pro-democracy protests that occupied parts of the city for almost three months have been jailed. These watershed moments, plus attempts to bring in national security laws, have created a citizenry hostile to any further encroachments from the mainland. The extradition bill appears to be the last straw. In Hong Kong\u2019s parliament disagreements over the issue have led to literal blows. \u2018The little boat is sinking\u2019 Critics say the law heralds the end of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy, under which Hong Kong has prospered as an international business and finance hub. The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has expressed \u201cserious reservations\u201d, saying such measures \u201cwould undermine perceptions of Hong Kong as a safe and secure haven for international business operations.\u201d Observers also worry about politically motivated arrests of foreigners. Following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Canada, two Canadians were quickly detained in China. In a joint statement, the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and Canada\u2019s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said they were worried about the potential effect of the proposals on the \u201clarge number of UK and Canadian citizens in Hong Kong\u201d. The former British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, has warned that the law would be the \u201cworst thing\u201d to happen in Hong Kong since the 1997 handover. The law would \u201cremove the firewall between Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law and the idea of law which prevails in communist China\u201d Patten said in video commentary posted online on Thursday. \u201cAn idea of law where there aren\u2019t any independent courts, where the courts and the security services and the party\u2019s rule, which are sometimes pretty obscure, are rolled all together,\u201d he said, referring to China\u2019s ruling Communist party. Ray Wong, an independence activist now living in Berlin, this week said it was \u201cthe nail in Hong Kong\u2019s coffin.\u201d \u201cBecause if this law is passed the legal system in Hong Kong will be destroyed. Hong Kong will be just another city in China,\u201d he said. Claudia Mo, a pan-democrat legislator, agrees: \u201cThey are trying to integrate Hong Kong so much into the mainland to the point that Hong Kong is to be disappeared,\u201d she says. \u201cThe little boat of Hong Kong is sinking fast.\u201d China\u2019s history of targeting dissidents on unrelated charges is well documented. In 2015, five booksellers who published salacious fictional material about China\u2019s leaders from Hong Kong\u2019s Causeway Bay disappeared from their homes only for some to reappear in mainland China confessing to non-political crimes like 13-year-old traffic offences. In 2008, journalist Cheong Ching was released after more than 1,000 days in jail for spying, in what he believes was retribution for writing an article critical of the Chinese Communist party. Ching says had they admitted the article was the motivation, there would have been an \u201cuproar\u201d. \u201c[So] when the Hong Kong government says they aren\u2019t going to send political prisoners to China, the problem is if China is making a request it will never be on political grounds.\u201d Lee, who has been referred to as Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cfather of democracy\u201d, is an internationally recognised campaigner for the political freedom the city was promised after 1997. He predicts many businesses who have based themselves inside Hong Kong\u2019s protective borders will pack up and go. \u201cHow can you do business in China by observing all the laws in China? There are too many restrictions, so you cut corners and pay bribes,\u201d he says. But Pro-Beijing government members are resolute, and accuse the opposition of fear-mongering. Regina Ip, a legislator and cabinet member, and a former secretary of security, says the bill is intended to fight crime across borders, and that mainland China is Hong Kong\u2019s most important crime-fighting partner because of high cross-border traffic by offenders. Ip has accused opponents of spreading \u201clies and falsehoods\u201d about the new law and has dismissed concerns Beijing would abuse the system. \u201cWe\u2019re not facing a situation where any ordinary Hong Kong person, because of some past dispute in mainland China, can be whisked across the border,\u201d she says. \u201cAll the human rights guarantees are there.\u201d Ip is adamant that the international outcry and the protest on Sunday \u2013 no matter how big \u2013 will have no impact. \u201cIf you cave in because of mass protest, that will encourage people to organise more protests on all sorts of China-sensitive issues,\u201d she says. But opponents of the bill also believe losing the battle is not an option. \u201cThis is now I think the last fight for Hong Kong,\u201d says Lee.
