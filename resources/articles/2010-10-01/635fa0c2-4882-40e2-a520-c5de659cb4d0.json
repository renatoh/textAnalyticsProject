He cost \u00a38.2m and when he arrived he had the bearing and physique of a Greek god. However, as one laboured match followed another, the striker seemed to have the speed and turning circle of something else that was quintessentially Greek \u2013 one of Aristotle Onassis's tankers. The delight on the Bolton bench when Elmander slid home a knockdown from Kevin Davies to stretch their unbeaten run to five matches was obvious. Here was a footballer who had been through plenty. He reflected that he had never been \"a 20- goal-a-season man\" but until he moved to the Reebok from Toulouse he had never been a five-goal-a-season man, which he was in his first two campaigns in England. The equaliser at Wigan represented his fifth in two months \u2013 all away from home. \"I have always been a striker who has scored between 10 and 15 goals a season but I make goals and I work hard,\" he said. \"That's what I did last season but in the Premier League, if you score goals, you get accepted.\" However, on the subject of his contract, which has less than a year to run, the 29-year-old Elmander was silent. Bolton may never recoup the money they paid Toulouse but they are keen for him to sign an extension. His manager scored 12 in his 54 games for Bolton and, much as Owen Coyle said he could share his experiences with the Swede, it had its limits. \"Ultimately it is up to Johan,\" he said. \"But he came to Bolton as a very good player and he has never lost that. He may have lost some confidence but not his core ability.\" Hugo Rodallega's self-belief remains untarnished. The Colombian fashioned three clear opportunities to give Wigan a victory that would have propelled them into the top half of the table \u2013 unimaginable to anyone who saw their first two games at the DW Stadium that finished with a collective scoreline of 0-10. Then they would have taken a draw with anyone but, as the teams marched off, Wigan's captain, Antol\u00edn Alcaraz, and his fellow defender, Steven Caldwell, were involved in a flare-up in a game marred by an ankle injury to James McCarthy that saw the Wigan midfielder taken off on a stretcher. McCarthy had a further scan in hospital yesterday, although the club is hopeful the injury is not as bad as feared. The spat between Caldwell and Alcaraz was one that their manager, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, appeared to welcome. \" showed how much players are starting to care about playing for Wigan Athletic. It was a little bit of frustration and a little bit of passion. The players apologised to each other and the group but that was one of the signs we have been waiting for for a long time.\" A lot of frustration would be the best way to sum up Chris Kirkland's season. He captained Wigan for their first two, humbling games, lost 4-0 to Blackpool, 6-0 to Chelsea, and was then discarded. He was back in goal only because Ali Al-Habsi was ineligible. This was a better memory, although at 29 Kirkland is no longer a keeper who can be filed under young and promising and, asked if he would consider his future if he did not force his way back as Mart\u00ednez's first choice by January, he replied: \"Definitely.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
