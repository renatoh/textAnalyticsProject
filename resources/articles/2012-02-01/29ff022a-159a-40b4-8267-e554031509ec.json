Don't read on if you haven't seen episode one \u2013 and if you've seen further in the series, please do not leave spoilers Angela Chase is all grown up, and she's running around Baghdad, trying to get a terrorist to provide her with \"intel\" on a possible attack on US soil. That terrorist is about to be hanged and her bosses at CIA base camp won't intervene, so she bribes her way into the prison and manages to get a whisper of something that makes her pull a distraught face before the guards come running down the corridor to stop her. It's all incredibly tense: this is Homeland, our resident renegade agent is Carrie Mathieson, and she's not one for the rules. \"Because of you, an American hero is coming home\" Flash-forward to 10 months later, and Carrie is back in the States, living in a sparse flat full of unpacked boxes, covered with jazz posters, and with a lovely Wallpaper-magazine-friendly desk. It's implied that she's been out all night \u2013 she gives herself a quick wipedown, takes a blue pill and rushes to work, late, where there's a big announcement to be made. Tom Hanks is no longer Cast Away! Oh, hold on. They've found a US marine sergeant, missing in action since 2003. Nicholas Brody, played for at least a few minutes by a strikingly beardy Damien Lewis, is coming home. Almost everyone is naturally very happy about this. It's a big patriotic shocker and it's very good for the country. But Carrie isn't thrilled, and we soon discover why. She has a meeting with her old boss and friend Saul Berenson and tells him what her terrorist told her: that an American prisoner of war has been turned. She thinks the intel leading to his rescue was planted. But after that whole diplomatic incident she caused 10 months ago, she's not in a position to do anything about it. Brody has a shave and a debriefing in Germany, while his wife is having some serious sex with a man who turns out to have been Brody's best friend Mike. (They thought he was dead, so you can't really blame them.) Brody doesn't know about this yet \u2013 though it's unlikely he won't find out \u2013 and he's busy puking on a plane, before seeing his family for the first time in eight years, then giving a motivational speech to the troops and to America. Then he goes home and has sex with his wife, who sees how mashed up he is from being a POW. \"Let's just say she's a little intense\" Carrie, meanwhile, celebrates his homecoming by getting his house ready for Big Brother: the Military Edition. She is doing this entirely illegally and with terrifying intensity. It turns out that those blue pills aren't exactly herbal hangover cures, but anti-psychotic medication, hidden in an aspirin bottle, to treat a secret mood disorder she's had since she was 22. Later, when Brody and Dana get down to it, she removes her headphones, so as not to pry \u2013 but watches anyway, in a moment of real creepiness. The next day, she sits in on Brody's debrief on the promise that she behaves herself. She doesn't, instead grilling him. What happened to Captain Walker, the soldier captured with him, who did not survive? Why didn't they kill Brody rather than keeping him alive for eight years? Did he meet Abu Nazir, her favourite terrorist bigwig? He says he doesn't know, but a series of flashbacks slowly suggest he isn't telling the truth. The first shows Abu Nazir, whom he claims he never met, gives him water as he's hanging from the ceiling with his hands bound. Perhaps Carrie isn't crazy after all. Although when Saul discovers that she's had Brody's apartment rigged with surveillance gear, we start to wonder, particularly when she implies that she'll sleep with him if he'll keep this quiet. It's the second really disturbing moment in the episode, because it's thoroughly despicable and shows just how dangerously fixated on this she really is. But she gets over it by playing some jazz, putting on a black dress and nipping out for another one night stand. Until she spots some more jazz being played in a hotel lobby, connects the movements of the music to the news footage of Brody, and realises that he's tapping out a signal/code with his fingers. Thank you jazz. It ends on another flashback. We see Brody punching Captain Walker's face in, and howling. So is Brody a bad man after all? Is Carrie, unstable and reckless, the only one who can stop him? Notes and observations It's all a little too easily tied up at the end of this episode, into Brody-is-bad and Carrie is\u2026 well, not good, but correct, and this is 12 episodes long, so there's got to be more to it than that. Carrie's CIA boss David throws in a line about how his blind spot for her lost him his wife and kids, which further complicates her work situation. She really needs to learn some life/work separation techniques. Mike, Brody's best friend and his wife's lover, says he works in intelligence now. This may prove significant. The first time I saw the pilot, a different actor (Laura Fraser) was playing Brody's wife, but it's now V's Morena Baccarin in the role. We're being steered towards not trusting the dodgy black ops-type surveillance gear installers, I think, though this has such a conspiracy feel to it already that I'm already second-guessing myself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
