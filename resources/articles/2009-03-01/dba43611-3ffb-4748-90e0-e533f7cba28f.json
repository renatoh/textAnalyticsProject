This is not a new idea. If you recognize it from the mind of a certain turgid 1950s novelist, then you win the door prize. Wiegel: Rep. John Campbell (R-Calif.), who gives his departing interns copies of Ayn Rand's novel \"Atlas Shrugged,\" told me today that the response to President Obama's economic policies reminded him of what happened in the 51-year-old novel. \"People are starting to feel like we're living through the scenario that happened in 'Atlas Shrugged,'\" said Campbell. \"The achievers, the people who create all the things that benefit rest of us, are going on strike. I'm seeing, at a small level, a kind of protest from the people who create jobs, the people who create wealth, who are pulling back from their ambitions because they see how they'll be punished for them.\" Campbell allows that this development is still \"a ways away,\" but seems likely to happen once people grasp that Obamanomics is socialism in drag. Kilgore, who notes Rand's strong antipathy toward religion, observes: I don't know if John Campbell's bought the whole Objectivist package from reading Rand, and privately considers all the nice churches in his California district evil temples of life-hating mysticism and theft. But like Rick Santelli, Cambell's an authentic apostle of the angry overclass that's sick of being betrayed by \"losers\" and then expected to help keep the scum alive. The Amity Schlaes revival was one thing. But Ayn Rand? Call it the gestalt of John Galt I guess. I keep wondering if liberals sounded this crazy in 2001 after Bush took over. I know some would say yes, we did, But then again, in 2001, we were talking about a president who had not won the popular vote and rather obviously would not have really won the election if 3,000 Jews in Florida hadn't mistakenly voted for Pat Buchanan. At least Obama really and clearly won. In any case, I admit that I'm enjoying watching their side tear their hair out. I was listening to Diane Rheem's show on NPR this morning, as David Frum and Byron York and others kvetched about what Republicans need to do. I sat in on so many meetings like that in 2003 or so. Better them than me, I sez."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
