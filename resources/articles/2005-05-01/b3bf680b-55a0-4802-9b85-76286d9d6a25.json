He is quoting from Jeremiah, chapter 17, verse 5. \"For he will be like a bush in the wastelands.\" The weather outside is biblically bad, as it often is in Fife, and the congregation sparse, around 20 people. Most of those are regulars at the Wednesday night bible class, a handful are first-timers and a couple are sceptics. But - Pastor Joe's considerable stage presence notwithstanding - only one member of the congregation is the centre of attention. Marvin Andrews, Rangers' first-choice centre-half and the club's players' player of the season, sits in the front row of the congregation dressed in tracksuit trousers and a dark blue T-shirt, nodding his head, tapping his bible. He looks the very picture of celestial calm. The mood will be very different tomorrow afternoon when the 29-year-old Trinidadian steps on to the pitch at Easter Road, carrying not just the hopes of the blue and white hordes but also the incredulity of the medical profession and the unstinting belief of his minister that a higher force has been at work in the temporal world of Scottish football. \"Marvin is living, breathing proof of the miracles that happen when man puts his trust in God.\" Pastor Joe is given to making outlandish claims on behalf of the Maker - that is his job, after all - but even a non-believer can readily agree that the resurrection of Marvin Andrews' football career is one of the more uplifting, and curious, stories of this or any other football season. It all began in March when Andrews hurt his left knee playing for Rangers against Dundee at Dens Park. The initial diagnosis was bad - he had suffered cruciate ligament damage - and it was said he would be out for four months. As the days passed and the club's medical staff dispatched the player to various specialists for their second opinions, the prospects for recovery grew even worse. A dozen years ago cruciate ligament damage was a career-ending injury but, with advances in medical technology, it no longer need be. Even so, Andrews injury was serious enough to require, in the words of one sports-injury specialist, \"restorative surgery followed by months of rest\". Faced with this diagnosis, most professional footballers would have checked themselves into the nearest private clinic but then most professional footballers do not have the deep spiritual faith of Rangers' centre-half. When Andrews first came to the Zion Praise Centre seven years ago he was a Raith Rovers player suffering from a pelvic injury. He was taken along by a team-mate, Tony Rougier, who said Pastor Joe could help. \"The doctors told Marvin he wouldn't be able to play football unless he had a steel plated inserted into his groin,\" Pastor Joe recalls. \"He was in agony. He was considering going home but, when he came to the church, I told him there is nothing God can't do. I told him to go and play. He believed that God was going to help him and that was when a miracle happened. From there his career took off.\" It was not quite as simple as that but eventually Andrews was playing well enough to get a move to a bigger club, Livingston, where his performances earned him a reputation as one of the stronger, more effective centre-backs in the league. As his reputation as a player grew so, too, did his involvement in the church and his reliance on faith when it came to making career decisions. For instance, at a time when Livingston were on the verge of bankruptcy, Andrews was offered a transfer to Dundee United, on a much larger salary. \"Unlike other footballers Marvin doesn't have an agent. God is his agent and God said he shouldn't go to Dundee United,\" says Pastor Joe says. He stayed. Three weeks later Rangers came in with an offer for Andrews. You do not need to be as omnipotent as God to understand why he grabbed it with both hands. These days Andrews is a church deacon, which involves preaching regularly whenever the Pastor is on his travels (he has a weekly TV show in Nigeria). He also assists during services. At Bible class this week he helped Nwokoye \"heal\" those people who had written asking to be healed - sprinkling their letters with healing oil and standing over them, speaking in tongues. He also laid hands on members of the congregation, including Wilma and Martin Hunter, two fans who turned up in Rangers strips looking for an autograph and ended being administered to for problems in their marriage. \"We do row a lot,\" Wilma said afterwards. \"Marvin is my favourite player,\" added her startled-looking husband. Given the strength of his faith, and his previous experience with injury, it was inevitable that Andrews would refuse medical treatment for his damaged knee. \"I respect the medical people at Rangers but I don't want to have the operation,\" he said at the time. \"I know it is hard for people to understand but God has given me strength. He is in control of my life and I believe it will be fine.\" Andrews has since been instructed by the club not to speak to the press, though he did tell the Guardian this week: \"My leg feels fantastic. There is no pain. No problems.\" It is to the enormous credit of the Rangers' manager Alex McLeish that he respected the player's religious faith, although the club did ask Andrews to sign a release absolving it of any responsibility should the player sustain a further injury that would probably end his career. Andrews insisted he was ready to play immediately but the manager rested him for a few weeks before selecting him for a reserve match. His return to first-team football came at the final Old Firm game of the season, won 2-0 by Celtic. Andrews's alleged lack of mobility was blamed for the loss of one of the goals but, looking at the highlights, it is fair to conclude that the goal had more to do with the pace and trickery of Craig Bellamy than any deficiencies in God's healing powers. \"Marvin is defying logic,\" says McLeish. This may be so but he cannot defy the bounce of the ball. Since his return the big centre-half has scored a couple of own- goals - a setback, concedes Pastor Joe, but not the kind that will come anywhere close to shaking the faith of his most famous congregant. \"Trust me, win, lose or draw tomorrow, Marvin will be preaching here on Sunday night as usual,\" he says. \"Tell your readers to come along and they will see that miracles really can happen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
