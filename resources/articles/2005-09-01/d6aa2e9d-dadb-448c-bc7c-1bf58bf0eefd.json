I really did", "bodyText": "I am predisposed to interpret the average cock-up as more the fruit of incompetence than conspiracy. I've had enough trouble getting my boiler repaired (after 10 different visits from tradesmen last year, it's broken again) or my council tax squared away (last spring, Southwark council was sending me three different bills per month for the same flat, and one for my neighbour's downstairs) to broadly conclude: most people are terrible at their jobs, and most organisations don't work. So universal is occupational worthlessness that I sometimes adopt a glass-half-full amazement at successful piss-ups in breweries. I pick up the phone: wow! There's a dial tone! Fabulous! I post a cheque: glory be! It arrived! There is a God! I commend installing the baseline assumption that pretty much nobody knows what they're doing and that any given agency will take any problem and make it worse so that you might savour the blazing miraculousness of the fact that civilisation functions at all. Moreover, my sympathies often gravitate toward unobvious candidates. So for four days following Hurricane Katrina, I shovelled bucketfuls of compassion at the most dubious of parties. Maybe I just like to feel useful. Other folks were already hurling outraged accusations at President Bush, Fema, the governments of Louisiana and Mississippi, the mayor of New Orleans, the National Guard, and ragtag coastal police forces - for being racist, for doing too little too late, for not having heeded warnings about levees and wetlands years ago ... So after every day of cable-news OD, through which comparing a region of the United States to anarchic third world countries such as Somalia actually became a cliche, I would rally to the authorities' defence: Surely no country is ever prepared for a catastrophe of this magnitude. So many awful things can happen at any one time that you can't organise to field all of them, like being at the net in tennis - oftentimes you can cover the down-the-line or the cross-court reply, but not both. Is Britain ready for Cornwall to drop into the sea? For a meteor the size of the Millennium Dome to land on parliament? For simultaneous nuclear attacks on Birmingham, Glasgow, and Leeds? And it doesn't matter how many decades a disaster such as the one that hit New Orleans has been predicted if it's big enough. Mark my words, when - not if, since seismologists tell us that the event is veritably guaranteed - the San Andreas fault finally obliges with the Big One in California, the results of that earthquake will be at least as horrific as Katrina, regardless of how many clever contingency plans now moulder in Sacramento libraries. Besides! I declare at dinner, on my second glass of wine. I used to run a catering business, and I appreciate how hard it is to move in food and water on such an epic scale. Remember how long it takes to pack a picnic for three people, and how reliably you still forget the corkscrew? Give these guys a break! The roads are in pieces, their cell phones don't work; no one even knows where a lot of the survivors are, since they can't communicate . . . I mean, I bend so far over backwards to be forgiving and tolerant and empathetic that I could have played limbo with the pole two inches high. As for whether the relief effort is sluggish and shambolic due to racism (intriguingly, American commentators took at least three days to finally observe, er, gosh, looks like most folks stranded down there are black), I cling fiercely to that partiality for seeing mere incompetence where others spot conspiracy. I sorely wish to believe that had the same misfortune befallen a wealthy white region such as Connecticut the response of American government top to bottom would be every bit as laggardly and useless. Call it naivet\u00e9, but I will this to be so, for I find the prospect of American race relations having progressed little beyond slavery too depressing to bear. (It is Jesse Jackson, a bit of an opportunist of whom I am none too fond, who observes that the thirsty, bloody, and unsanitary scenes at the New Orleans convention centre resembled a slave ship; I'm afraid he's dead on.) In this matter, I prefer delusion to indignation. True, by the time I get around to defending George Bush my justifications grow feeble. Sure, I concede. He doesn't look too upset. He's crap at feeling your pain. But Bill Clinton was just as big an emotional fraud; he was simply a better actor. Bush is an appalling rhetorician at the best of times - which these ain't. And this president's entire political lexicon has been fashioned around enemies. Look at him: he's lost. He can't rail at Katrina for opposing \"freedom\" and \"democracy,\" even if the bloody storm does have a girl's name. He can't decry the \"axis of evil\" comprising Iran and North Korea and then throw in a hurricane without somebody piping up, \"What doesn't belong in this picture?\" Since it's a stretch to blame Osama bin Laden for the weather, his speechwriters are stymied. Yet by about Day Five, all that woolly understanding of mine was exhausted. Last December the US mobilised massive relief for a flood halfway around the world in two days, and after nearly a week those people just down in Louisiana still didn't have any water. As New Orleans was tyrannised by marauding gangs, the National Guard barely started to trickle in, more slowly than we get them to Iraq. As for the race thing, just the way this horror-show looks has set American race relations one giant step backwards, as if Bush has been playing a national game of Simon Says. The hash that every agency involved has made of this rescue effort plays to the most cynical suspicions of African-Americans. Never mind the truth of the matter; that no one in local, state, or federal government gives a rat's ass about those folks because they're black and poor is now well on its way from supposition to established fact. Compare the post-Katrina Gulf to ramshackle African states as you may, but I've lived in Africa, and one thing you can say for Africans in general is that they're used to things going wrong. They expect to be neglected. They can bring a remarkably philosophical resignation to bear even on disease-carrying flood waters strewn with bloated corpses, on having nothing to eat or drink and being utterly abandoned, and this is where our American friends in New Orleans part company with the Dark Continent. Those people are furious. And so am I."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
