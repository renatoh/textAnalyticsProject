A live feed from a camera close to the stones has been set up \u2013 appropriately enough on the summer solstice \u2013 to allow people to tune in to the monument whenever they want. After dark, the live feed is replaced by a computer-generated image of the night sky as it would be at the moment a viewer clicks on the link to the website. English Heritage hopes the feed will allow those who cannot make the trip in person to experience sunrise, sunset and the ever-changing night sky, and even make them feel closer to the ancient people who created the stone circle. The Stonehenge Skyscape project may also be used as a method of worship for those who believe the stone circle and landscape is a deeply spiritual place. Susan Greaney, a senior historian at English Heritage, said: \u201cStonehenge was built to align with the sun, and to neolithic people the skies were arguably as important as the surrounding landscape. \u201cAt solstice we remember the changing daylight hours, but the changing seasons, cycles of the moon and movements of the sun are likely to have underpinned many practical and spiritual aspects of neolithic life. \u201cStonehenge\u2019s connection with the skies is a crucial part of understanding the monument today and we are really excited to share this view online with people all over the world. If someone can\u2019t travel to Stonehenge, they will still be able to witness what is happening there from wherever they are. People on the other side of the world will be able to see sunrise at Stonehenge.\u201d As part of the project, English Heritage has joined forces with the space scientist and science educator Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, who will host a star and moon-gazing event next month. She said: \u201cImagine our neolithic ancestors sitting around a fire looking up at the heavens and telling stories inspired by the movement of the planets, the patterns of the stars and of course the sun and the moon. \u201cStonehenge Skyscape offers a mesmerising insight into our ancestors\u2019 lives and hopefully, beyond visiting the website, it will inspire people all over the world to go outside and look up.\u201d Aderin-Pocock said the project could help people who were were losing their connection with the night sky because of light pollution. \u201cPeople who are aware of Stonehenge but not able to make the trip can see the sunrise, the sunset and the stars there. It gives global access to something really amazing. It could also help people who are stressed. There\u2019s something very peaceful about gazing at the sky.\u201d Stonehenge Skyscape is a composite representation of the sky above the stones accurate to within a window of approximately five minutes. After dark it switches from a photographic depiction to a computer-generated one, which accurately displays the live location of the stars and visible planets. Neptune, Uranus and Pluto are consciously not included because, being invisible to the naked eye, they were undiscovered until the 18th century or later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
