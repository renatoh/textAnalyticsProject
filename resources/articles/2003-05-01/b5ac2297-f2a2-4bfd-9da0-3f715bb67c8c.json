In a statement last Thursday, Charles Clarke conceded that the Department for Education and Skills bore some responsibility for the difficulties schools are facing over next year's funding settlement, but continued to maintain that the real villains of the piece are those local education authorities (LEAs) that \"are still not increasing their schools budget to match in full the increase in education resources from central government\". This is just not true. The government sets a figure which it asks LEAs to passport to the service, but it does not provide all the money. LEAs have to provide a significant part, and any extra has to come from increased council taxes or cuts in other services, such as social services or roads. \"Passporting is not a passive process of passing on government money,\" says Ian Budd, assistant director of strategic management at Shropshire education services, \"but a very active one requiring local decisions. \"Local authorities, in aggregate, are passporting the full increase in provision to schools for 2003/4, even where it is not backed up by grant, and are planning to spend above the government's provision for schools by approximately \u00a3100m. Even so, the picture is not that simple, because no single decision can be taken in isolation: if more is spent on schools and less on social services, would that mean more pressure on schools if families were less well supported?\" But Clarke continues to believe that LEAs are holding back monies from schools. And while it is true that not all money for education is passed on by LEAs to schools, there is often a very good reason for this. Schools do not provide all education services in- house. The LEAs have to make provision for children with special educational needs, some of whom may need to be educated outside the LEA, as well as for natural disasters, such as fires and floods. This is contingency planning, no more no less, of the type the DfES itself quite properly makes provision for in its own budget. As an olive branch to schools and LEAs, the education secretary last week suggested schools would be given the flexibility to use capital funding to support revenue expenditure \"where failure to do so would lead to excessive instability\". This went down predictably badly with schools, which have long been saying that the only solution to the crisis is more cash. David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, argued that the response to the schools' funding crisis was too little, too late. \"The lack of any new money will be seen as a bad error of judgment,\" he said. \"Converting capital into revenue and licensing deficit budgets could help some schools, but these measures, akin to rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, will not provide the relief that all schools in trouble desperately need now.\" Ron Newey, head of Hornsea school in east Yorkshire, agrees. \"I'm \u00a3238,000 short of a standstill budget compared with last year,\" he says. \"To make the budget work I've had to, among other things, cut \u00a340,000 from my supply budget, \u00a315,000 from staff training, \u00a310,000 from buildings maintenance and improvements, \u00a360,000 from learning resources, \u00a310,000 from exam fees and use up my carry-forward of \u00a369,000. \"How I'm going to meet my statutory commitments for the new workforce agenda, I just don't know. The impact on the school is going to be enormous. My supply budget could run out by the end of the autumn, meaning classes will either have to be doubled up or sent home. There is no scope for any professional development that takes teachers away from school, and students may not be able to retake exams.\" The irony is that Hornsea school has been busy following the government's education agenda. It has expanded its 14-19 provision with a greater choice of GCSEs and work- related qualifications, incurring significant extra costs along the way, and has just rustled up the \u00a350,000 - no easy matter in a rural community with no large businesses - to apply for specialist status. All of which is now at risk, because the very things that improve the school have serious implications for its budget in the coming years. The reasons for the crisis - in particular the changes to national insurance contributions, superannuation, pay scales and the funding formula - have been well rehearsed. Chris Huss, head at Wilfred Owen and chair of Shropshire's primary central policy group, believes if you strip out the increases to national insurance, pay rises and superannuation from the extra \u00a32.7bn the government says it has provided for education, there is a net increase of just \u00a3250m (or 1%) to be shared amongst all schools. \"When you consider that government is only funding about 60% of the increases in performance-related pay at upper pay spine 2 (UPS2) and for heads and deputies, the increasing costs of special needs education, and that in Shropshire we've been told to budget for a 20% increase in electricity costs, you can see why so many schools are struggling,\" Huss points out. It's also worth noting that not all authorities get an equal share of the 1%. When the government found an extra \u00a328m to help out struggling authorities earlier in the year, none of it went to either Shropshire or East Riding, two of the worst-funded LEAs in the country. There's a similar tale of cash starvation in the cities. Last Wednesday, the heads of London LEAs were called in to discuss the situation with the minister for education. It emerged that funding for the police in London is 78% and funding for social services is 55% above the national average. \"These figures reflect the special circumstances and needs of the capital,\" said councillor Geoffrey Samuel, deputy leader and cabinet member for schools on Richmond council. \"However, funding for education is a mere 10% greater than the average for the rest of the country. This cannot be right. \"In Richmond, where we have recently had to top up government funding for schools out of general funds, this proves our point: the government has seriously underfunded education and must take full responsibility for any shortfall. The government is promising additional next year. This is not good enough; we need the extra money now.\" While Charles Clarke may be keen to avoid any talk of extra cash, he is even keener to avoid any talk of what happens next year. Because however bad the situation is now, it can only get worse if nothing changes. There will be no carry-forwards left to soak up the deficits, and those schools that had got away with setting deficit budgets will have to get further into debt as they have no realistic means of paying back what they owe. Changes to performance pay in UPS3 will come online in 2004/5, and schools will have to absorb the total costs of all UPS performance pay in 2005/6. There are also further changes as several more grants become absorbed into base budgets, almost inevitably leading to a reduction in money available; next year, the support staff grants and support for newly qualified teachers will disappear, making it still harder for schools to balance their budgets and deliver their teacher workload commitments. And those schools that have followed the DfES's specialist charter will have to find more and more of their own money to deliver on their promises as the grant is not inflation-proof. Despite all this, there remains a general mood of optimism that the government will put up its hands, admit it got things wrong, and put them into its pocket. \"I realise the DfES has introduced a lot of changes at one time,\" says Newey, \"but I can't believe it didn't model their effects on a typical school. If it had, it would have seen these problems coming. I've seen our LEA budget and the money just isn't there. Finding new money is the only answer: we've already cut things as far as we can while protecting staffing levels. The only future savings we can make are redundancies.\" Ian Budd maintains there is still time to work things out with the government. \"We need to get it right, and we will get it right.\" But all are agreed there are only two possible explanations for the DfES's blinkered view of the funding crisis: incompetence or cynicism. And given the government's current record, no one is exactly sure which it is."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
