The British Baghdad-based reporter Matt McAllester, 33, who is a former Middle East bureau chief for Newsday, and photographer Moises Saman, 29, have not been heard from for four days. They last made contact with the Long Island-based newspaper on Monday, just before witnesses said they were rounded up with about eight other foreign-based journalists for expulsion from Iraq. \"We're trying to work through the Iraqi ministry; we're trying to work through the Red Cross; the Vatican has an office in Baghdad... we're trying to get officials in other governments that have embassies there,\" said Tony Marro, the editor of Newsday. Marro also said Iraqi officials at the United Nations agreed to help locate the two men through official channels. He said McAllester and Saman were both officially accredited as journalists by the Iraqi ministry of information. Western reporters still in Baghdad told Newsday the two were to be driven by bus to either the Jordanian or Syrian border and expelled over alleged visa problems. McAllester and Saman entered Iraq a month ago on visas issued to journalists covering anti-war activists who had volunteered as so-called human shields against a US attack. Newsday has about a dozen journalists reporting on the war from the Gulf region. McAllester and Saman are both experienced at working in war zones, including Afghanistan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
