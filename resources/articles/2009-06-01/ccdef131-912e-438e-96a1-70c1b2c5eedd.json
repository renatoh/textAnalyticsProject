Burnham was scheduled to address the Football League's summer meeting in Portugal tomorrow but instead of pronouncing on the national game he is now the minister responsible for the National Health Service. Burnham was expected in his speech to review the responses he received from the Football League, Premier League and Football Association to seven challenges he posed last October, when he called for football to \"reassess its relationship with money\". Given his view that the game risked \"losing further touch with its traditional supporter base\" if it did not curb the extremes of commercialisation, it is fair to assume he was not wholly satisfied with the answers, particularly a controversially abject one submitted by the FA. The letter, which was from the FA chairman, Lord Triesman, is understood to be only four pages long and to contain no actual answers to Burnham's questions on club debts, English football's competitive balance, issues of ownership and how to develop more talented English players. Instead Triesman simply refers Burnham to the responses delivered by the professional leagues. Triesman explained this apparent surrender in his letter, writing: \"The responses reflect the views that whatever concepts are explored, those adopted will succeed only with the buy-in of the professional game.\" That is said by sources close to the process to have constituted a clear signal that, as currently constituted, the FA, English football's governing body, cannot reach its own, independent view of how the game should be run. The problem, which repeatedly thwarts attempts to define a specific FA view, is that the Association's board is split, with five representatives of the professional game \u2013 three from the Premier League, two from the Football League \u2013 and five from the amateur \"national\" game, plus Triesman as the independent chairman. Triesman is understood to have worked on a response to Burnham's questions with senior FA executives for some months, only for his proposals to be rejected, first by the board's Premier League representatives, then by senior Premier and Football League representatives acting together. The national game directors are thought to have been broadly in favour of Triesman's proposals, which called for the FA to have more authority over the game's financial regulation and to strengthen controls over club debt and takeovers. Some Premier League sources, however, accuse Triesman of not consulting enough, of springing the proposals on the professional game as a fait accompli, thus ensuring their rejection. Triesman is said to have been exasperated by the initial refusal, delivered by the Premier League chairman, Sir Dave Richards, to work on a joint response, and then by the wholly negative reaction to the document he worked up. As the FA chairman, Triesman could have exercised his casting vote in favour of his proposals but he realised that would be unworkable and instead wrote to Burnham, offering nothing. It was a shock for the DCMS to receive so apparently limp and vacant a response but it was quickly interpreted, according to one source, as \"a cry for help\". In effect the chairman of the FA has told the government that the FA cannot meet the challenge of governing football while it is hobbled by vested interests on its board. That was a huge admission, quite an opening to deliver to Burnham and now to his successor at DCMS, Ben Bradshaw. Given Burnham's political record of urging football away from a free-market, hyper-commercialised vision of itself, he was expected to grasp the nettle and call for the FA to reform itself and become more independent and robust. The governing body will always be representative of all football's interests, from the oligarchs, leverage merchants and overseas billionaires who have been allowed to buy the top clubs to the children turning up on windswept public parks which have for too long been permitted to pass for the game's grass roots. In 2005 Lord Burns produced a report which called on the FA to break the deadlock on its board by appointing an independent chairman \u2013 Triesman became the first, last year \u2013 and two independent directors. The latter recommendation has never been implemented and the sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, who worked closely with Burnham on the football questions, is thought to have formed the view, as a result of that process, that Burns' recommendations must now be implemented. For many in football, however, the Burns review was a limp and timid document. They will hope that appointing two independent directors will constitute only the start of a move towards an FA which can display some independence of thought and action. Burnham had publicly welcomed the responses from the Premier and Football Leagues, for containing some sensible proposals. Most intriguingly, the Football League chairman, Lord Mawhinney, suggested that the two leagues should sell their television rights together and, by implication, find a new and fairer way of sharing out the money. That proposal, if it were implemented, would unify the professional game after years of the Premier League clubs hogging the vast bulk of the new TV fortunes, having broken away from the Football League's sharing arrangements in 1992. Burnham was expecting a meaty response to follow from the FA. Instead Triesman's \"cry for help\" constituted an open invitation to the government to call for fundamental reform. Bradshaw is understood to have declined to travel to Portugal in Burnham's place so soon after taking on his new brief but, with Sutcliffe confirmed to be staying as sports minister, the DCMS is expected to give its view on the responses, and the question of FA reform, within the next few weeks. The irony of this debacle is that the Premier League has always been in favour of the Burns reforms. The representatives of the national game rejected the proposal for independent directors and some are understood still to be resistant to the idea. \"We have always said that the Burns reforms should be implemented in full,\" a Premier League spokesman said, \"and we maintain that view.\" Burnham began the process of examining football's tortured inner workings 12 years ago when, despite an unpromising brief as the administrator of the Football Task Force, he succeeded in wresting significant reforms, including substantial money for grass-roots facilities, from the Premier League. He was reshuffled last week just before delivering a final verdict on the state of the game. The conclusion, it turns out, is obvious \u2013 it is the one which screams out whenever the governance of the national game is considered. The detail of seven specific questions cannot even be considered until one overriding truth has been addressed: the FA is not strong or independent enough to be the governing body of a game which is swimming in money and whose urgent challenge is not to drown in it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
