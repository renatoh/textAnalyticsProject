The government has been insistent on fixing an \"out of control\" scheme by cracking down on \"rorts\". On the other hand, its critics have challenged whether the scheme is being abused, accusing the government of xenophobia in the process. So much heat, so little light. The government bears significant responsibility for this unedifying debate. Its overblown rhetoric has muddied the waters, and allegations of widespread \"rorting\" were not substantiated with evidence. If this were an out of control system, why were the amendments it proposed in February merely technical? Why were they, in the words of Michael Easson, chair of the government\u2019s Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, simply a \"tidying-up\" of the program? On the other hand, the government was also charged with xenophobia as it insisted on \"putting Australian workers first\". Yet, there is nothing necessarily xenophobic in emphasising that the government\u2019s primary duty in relation to job creation is to the citizens and permanent residents of this country. Indeed, there does not seem to be strong disagreement with this notion. Neither does there seem to be strong disagreement with the need for a temporary skilled migration program like the 457 program. The ACTU and unions, for one, support a strong permanent migration program with temporary migration to fill genuine skill shortages. The real question is: what kind of 457 visa program should Australia have? Once we focus on the specifics, a startling fact emerges. Despite the common assumption that the 457 program requires employers to recruit local workers before sponsoring a worker, there is no such obligation \u2013 the program does not have a labour market testing requirement. Even more remarkably, this has been the case for most of the program\u2019s life: when enacted in 1996, the scheme did impose a labour market testing condition, but this requirement was abolished in 2001. The Howard Coalition government repealed this requirement, but this did not change with the election of the ALP government. Indeed, until very recently, the ALP government stood opposed to such a requirement. Earlier this month, however, the government introduced a bill which will require labour market testing under the 457 scheme. If passed, the immigration minister will have to be satisfied that \"a suitably qualified and experienced Australian citizen or Australian permanent resident is not readily available to fill the nominated position\" prior to approving a nomination for a 457 position (the bill also provides for exemptions in relation to major disasters, international trade obligations and highly skilled occupations). This change of view should be heartily welcomed. This is not simply because a labour market testing requirement will better protect the employment opportunities of Australian workers. More fundamentally, such a requirement is vital for the 457 program to fulfill its raison d\u2019\u00eatre \u2013 addressing skill shortages. Some will complain that a labour market testing requirement will make it more difficult for employers to source foreign workers. This is true \u2013 but rightly so. The 457 program is a scheme that provides permission to employers to recruit foreign workers in limited circumstances; it is not a licence for them to source foreign labour as they see fit. A genuine debate regarding temporary labour migration and its role in addressing skill shortages should not be confined to migration policy. There are more than 1.2 million temporary migrants with work rights in Australia (including international students, and New Zealand citizens). 457 visa workers and their families only amount to around one-eighth of this total. It is somewhat bizarre to have such heated discussion of these workers with almost no consideration of the other (more numerous) groups of temporary migrants. It is imperative to ask: how have these alleged shortages come about? Once this question is asked, the role of the education and training sector in providing skills comes to the fore, as does industry planning, regional development and a number of related policies. A debate that extends to all temporary migrant workers in Australia should have justice for these workers, as well as Australian workers, as an anchor point \u2013 but not in the way the government continues to do. Its statements about \"putting Aussie workers first\" by \"putting foreign workers at the back of the queue\" poses a false trade-off that does fuel xenophobia \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t Australian workers be hostile to foreign workers if they perceive them as a threat to their working conditions? Worse, this imagined conflict can be a smoke-screen for the government\u2019s failure to effectively address the growing problem of precarious work, now extending to almost 40% of all jobs. What is needed are not divisive notions of industrial justice that pitch one group of workers against another, but solidarity that stresses the right of all workers, including temporary migrant workers, to decent work. A genuine debate regarding temporary labour migration will not take place until our leaders realise the special duty of care they have in conducting migration debates. This duty arises because these debates can easily be infused with racism; it also arises because migrants often lack an effective voice in the political process. There is something particularly vile here in using migrants as pawns in the electoral game. It is not just the ethics of temporary labour migration that is at stake, but the ethics of migration debates. \u2022 This article draws on a speech Joo-Cheong Tham gave at the recent Transport Workers\u2019 Union National Council"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
