When it comes to ding-dongs, this pair make Felix and Oscar look like a newly married couple running upstairs to the honeymoon suite. Still, the Englishman is nothing if not savvy and, as the grateful recipient of one of Nick Faldo's wild-card picks for last year's Ryder Cup, he knows better than anyone how important it is to be in the captain's enchanted circle. With Europe seeking to copy the American policy of giving the captain up to four picks, this might be truer than ever. Watching Montgomerie handle his newly acquired status as the most popular man on tour, as well as the dynamics of his personal relations with other players \u2013 the good, the bad and ugly \u2013 will be one of the more fascinating parlour games of the next 18 months although it can safely be said at this early stage that Poulter need have no worries. If he plays well he will be in the team. Like anyone else the Scotsman has his faults but bearing grudges is not one of them. More to the point, he likes to win and if the road to victory over the United States at Celtic Manor next autumn requires him to select a player with whom he has enjoyed less than cordial relations over the years then he will have no hesitation to do exactly that. Nor need there be any doubt about the ability of Europe's new captain to handle the second most important task that comes with the job: promoting the Ryder Cup and the game of golf. Understandably, Montgomerie's selection was framed yesterday in purely sporting terms but it is hard to believe that commercial consideration did not have at least a small part to play in the decision. These are difficult times for golf, which relies heavily on the financial sector for sponsorship, and the heaviest hitters will be called upon to maintain what support there is as well as bringing new money into the game. Tiger Woods aside, a case could be made for saying that no one sells the sport better than Montgomerie. Certainly no one embodies the Ryder Cup and the concept of team golf more than he does. If there were doubts about the ability of the European Tour to sell corporate hospitality boxes and tickets for next year's event they disappeared with yesterday's news. As for Captain Montgomerie's relationship with the media, another important aspect of his new role, things have never looked better \u2013 for the time being at least. At times the Scot has been boorish and rude to journalists in the relatively private space next to the scorer's hut but, as he proved during yesterday's press conference, when television cameras are switched on he can be charm itself. He can also be funny and smart and, when the mood takes him, quite reflective \u2013 all qualities that will serve him well over the coming months as he comes to terms with the fact that his Ryder Cup playing career is in effect over. Whether they will sustain his mood when his game declines, as it inevitably will when his captain's responsibilities consume more and more of his time, is debatable. He has never enjoyed playing mediocre golf but, frankly, he had better get used to it. No more stomping off in the huff after signing for a 75, no more barking at photographers going quietly about their business, no more informing television cameramen, as he did last year, that \"You are only here because of me.\" Ryder Cup captains don't behave like that. If he finds this difficult, and he will, then he will have numerous consolations \u2013 the adoration of the golfing public, the financial windfall that comes with the captaincy and, more than anything, the chance to do what Nick Faldo could not and return Sam Ryder's trophy to the European Tour's headquarters at Wentworth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
