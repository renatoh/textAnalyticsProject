Conservative Wagga surprises with climate emergency declaration", "bodyText": "The people of Wagga Wagga are famously stubborn. On the north side of the Murrumbidgee river is a low-lying village of homes that once flooded five times a year. The signpost at North Wagga Wagga has for decades served as a warning to town planners: \u201cWe shall not be moved.\u201d \u201cWe are a very conservative city,\u201d says the local mayor, Greg Conkey. \u201cA lot of people do not accept climate change.\u201d Last week, the Wagga Wagga city council voted to declare a climate emergency. In sum, 28 local government areas have made a similar declaration \u2013 but never before in a place such as Wagga, where they prayed for rain at the scorching height of the last major drought, and where the local MP is the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, who recently told a constituent he disputed evidence of global heating. Conkey, a former journalist who ran the Riverina Leader community newspaper for 25 years, rejects the suggestion that his support for the emergency declaration might be brave or naive, even as local political attacks are being amped up. \u201cI find it unusual that we should be having this debate in the first place,\u201d Conkey says. \u201cThe debate regarding climate change was done and dusted years ago. It\u2019s a reality and 97% of scientists agree that climate is changing at a rapid pace. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s our job and our responsibility to plan for the future, to look after the future of the city. \u201cSome people you\u2019ll never convert. There are a couple of companies who have come out publicly and said they\u2019re seriously concerned about impacts on their business and I\u2019ll be looking at that. But my argument is that if we don\u2019t have a sustainable and resilient community, we won\u2019t have jobs at all. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy, it\u2019s probably not going to be cheap. But we\u2019re trying to mitigate the costs to the community that climate change will bring.\u201d On Thursday morning, Conkey\u2019s face appeared on signs plastered around the town centre, along with those of three others who voted for the climate emergency motion, accusing them of selling out ratepayers. A vote to repeal the declaration will be held on Monday night. Progress won\u2019t be won without a fight. Droughts and flooding rains In between two major droughts, about 9,000 people were evacuated from Wagga Wagga when the Murrumbidgee river hit a 159-year high, flooding large parts of the city. \u201cThe droughts and flooding rains are part of the mythology of Australia. It\u2019s in our poetry,\u201d says Andrew Wallace, an education professor and climate campaigner, who is also the chair of the Wagga Wagga Conservatorium of Music. Wallace talks about the way historical weather events, which experts say are made more extreme by climate change, often work to entrench beliefs that weather patterns are cyclical. \u201cFamilies have kept weather records on their farms ... that go back often 100-120 years. And looking back through that they\u2019re seeing the droughts and flooding rains. So over generations, they have experienced this cycle, suffered through the bad times, maybe lose a crop or two, because they know the good times are coming. \u201cBut now it\u2019s different, and it\u2019s really dangerous.\u201d Most of the local resistance to the emergency declaration has centred on councillor Paul Funnell, who during the debate last week compared parents taking their children to climate rallies to child abuse. Funnell\u2019s family were among the first European settlers in the district. \u201cI damn well know what\u2019s going on in the climate,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf you look back historically, it\u2019s very similar to what we went through right through the 20th century. Every decade there were droughts. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting how this is discussed. I\u2019ve never heard anyone say there\u2019s no such thing as climate change. Of course there\u2019s climate change, of course it\u2019s changing. This is not the impact that people are making it out to be, some are calling it a new green religion. \u201cI\u2019d say three quarters of people who speak to me [about the climate emergency declaration] say \u2018make sure you get rid of this nonsense\u2019. I go to the store, I go to the car mechanic, it doesn\u2019t matter where I go, people are talking about it. \u201cThe majority of people who talk to me say \u2018if the experts can\u2019t agree, then what hope have you got?\u2019 It\u2019s a realm where we shouldn\u2019t go.\u201d Wallace says he worries, as the debate becomes hysterical, that the \u201cloaded\u201d terminology about a climate emergency is perhaps \u201ctowards the edge for a community like this\u201d. \u201cBut just by having the debate, there\u2019s benefit. Bringing it into consciousness means there\u2019s always some people who think about it for the first time. These massive events, catastrophic weather events, those events trigger people to come back to the argument. You come back to God because you need him. This is one of those times, it\u2019s time to move and bring those sorts of things forward.\u201d \u2018This city has changed for the better\u2019 On the surface, Wagga Wagga has changed very little in the past decade. The coffee shops have improved, and the trees along Baylis Street have grown taller. A few old pubs have gone out of business. At the same time, social progress has crept slowly through parts of the community. This is a place where, in 1993, the editor of the Daily Advertiser newspaper wrote columns attacking \u201csordid homosexuality\u201d and responded to backlash by branding himself homophobic. Today, Wagga hosts a March Mardi Gras festival, which attracted about 10,000 people to a parade through town, and was embraced by many locals. The newspaper editor is now the local MP and Australia\u2019s deputy prime minister. Michael McCormack has distanced himself from those statements and other columns he wrote backing the death penalty and ridiculing women\u2019s sport, saying they do not represent his current views. And while McCormack, who has hinted at his scepticism about man-made climate change, easily won the seat of Riverina at the May election, there is no longer a sense in Wagga that this is safe political territory for conservatives. The area\u2019s state MP is independent Joe McGirr, a popular local doctor, who has been vocal in his support for the emergency declaration. During his term as mayor, Conkey has marched in support of domestic violence victims, and with the council\u2019s Mardi Gras float. \u201cPeople said 15 years ago, 20 years ago you\u2019d never have had a Mardi Gras in this city,\u201d Conkey says. \u201cI was one of those people who was marching. I walked with my wife, together with the deputy mayor and his wife, to show that we are an inclusive community. We have something like 112 nationalities represented in this city. We speak 107 languages, we\u2019re a very multicultural city. \u201cWe voted 65% in favour of the monarchy in the 1990s. It would be interesting to see what that vote would be now. We voted in favour of same-sex marriage, I was delighted that we did that. Again, 15 years ago, that wouldn\u2019t have happened. This city has changed in recent times for the better.\u201d Labor councillor Vanessa Keenan, who proposed the climate emergency motion, says the past few weeks have shown that climate is not just a fringe issue, even in notionally conservative regional areas. \u201cIf you asked a month ago, who are the people in this community who are passionate about climate change, then people would picture someone with dreadlocks, a tree-hugging hippy,\u201d Keenan says. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen are doctors, farmers, parents, business owners, pharmacists, people from all walks of life come out and say they want to see climate action happen at a local level.\u201d Fridays for the Future Dr Trudi Beck, a Wagga Wagga general practitioner, has spent every Friday for the past few months camped outside McCormack\u2019s office, holding a picnic protest and calling for action on climate change. \u201cThere\u2019s people like me who never cared about any sort of political activism who are saying we have to quietly and respectfully start to deal with this at a grassroots level,\u201d Beck says. \u201cWe\u2019ve always tried to do what we could in our backyard to have chickens and compost and vegetables, but once you start being interested in those things, the natural progression of that contact with nature is to start being concerned about the bigger picture.\u201d Like many people of her generation, Beck left Wagga Wagga and returned. The city has a growing number of professionals, many working in healthcare and education. Beck\u2019s unique form of regional activism has been effective in bringing debate into the local mainstream. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people of my generation who have moved away, realised Wagga does have a lot to offer, and who have come back with different world views or experiences that they\u2019re integrating into life here,\u201d Beck says. \u201cRallies and protests are a bit too aggressive for people in this area. So we thought how can we make this something where average people like us might be able to relate to the idea that climate change is important, and how can we do it in a way that\u2019s peaceful. \u201cInitially it was just me and the kids, over time it\u2019s grown to be more people than that.\u201d Beck says the Fridays for the Future demonstrations garnered \u201cmore attention than we necessarily wanted\u201d. \u201cAll you have to do is go on to any Facebook page of a local newspaper in an area such as Wagga when any environmental or climate change-related article is published and see the kinds of comments that are made there to realise those sorts of [conservative] sentiments can be deeply held by a portion of the city. I didn\u2019t expect it to become as publicly nasty ... but the opposition didn\u2019t surprise me. \u201cWe just need to call it for what it is, say it\u2019s an emergency and deal with it like it is an emergency.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
