With rain deteriorating conditions through the afternoon, all seven runners were soon racing on the stands side, with Times Review setting the pace and stillat the head of affairs turning into the straight. But Keith Dalgleish had Lucky Story poised, ready to pounce, and when asked to go about his business he did so in good style despite the testing ground. Striking the front two furlongs out, he forged clear to pass the post with six lengths to spare over Mac The Knife. Johnston was represented by his wife Deirdre, who said: \"In Mark's stable tour, he said that Lucky Story was top or thereabouts among our two-year-olds, so we were really disappointed when he was beaten first time out at Ayr. \"He was so laid back that he never really got going, but he won there next time and he is a lovely, lovely horse. \"I sat on him all last week, Monday to Saturday, and you just don't want to get off him. He is getting better and better with racing and doing now what we thought he could do. \"He has the scope, the size and the temperament, and though we take it one race at a time, we may step him up in grade and trip now.\" Luca Cumani's Fernery, a well-bred individual, gave her paddocks value a big boost when getting her name on the score sheet in decisive fashion under Kevin Darley in the Wilfred Underwood Memorial Maiden Fillies' Stakes, always travelling, she beat Phi Beta by an easy one and threequarter lengths.."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
