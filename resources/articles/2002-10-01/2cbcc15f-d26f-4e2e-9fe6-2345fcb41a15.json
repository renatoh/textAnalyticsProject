Dein, also the vice-chairman of Arsenal, made the suggestion ahead of today's Uefa meeting scheduled to deal with more than 100 recent disciplinary cases and including four of alleged racism towards players from English clubs. The most notable instances were last month's Uefa Cup game between Fulham and Hajduk Split in Croatia, and Ipswich's match against Sartid in Yugoslavia on October 3. Both clubs are likely to be fined. The other incidents involved Liverpool players at Valencia and Arsenal's at PSV Eindhoven. \"The appropriate punishment is for the club to play their next game behind closed doors,\" Dein said. \"A fine does not hit the right target. The fans perpetrated the misdemeanour and they should be targeted. If a club is just fined, the fans still show up.\" The Arsenal defender Ashley Cole, referring to the match at PSV, said: \"I just blocked it out and got on with the game, even when there were monkey chants whenever a black player had the ball. At half-time it wasn't something that we discussed even though there were nine black players in the side that match.\" The Football Association has also scheduled a meeting for later today involving Uefa officials and the Football Against Racism in Europe group. \u00b7 Everton's manager David Moyes is hoping to persuade the referee Mike Riley to rescind the red card he issued to David Weir at Manchester United for a professional foul on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer that brings with it a one-match suspension. \"There is no question that David has had a pull at him just outside the box,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
