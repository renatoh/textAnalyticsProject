But Nigerian cinema has evolved and this year a slew of new film-makers are tackling grittier subjects \u2013 and winning international acclaim. A roster of screenings at autumn\u2019s Film Africa festival in London reveal directors unafraid to look at issues such as gender equality, postnatal depression and transatlantic migration. Running until 8 November, and available to view online, Film Africa opens with The Ghost and the House of Truth, which follows a counsellor working with convicts who must learn to forgive her own daughter\u2019s killer. Other issues such as female infertility and religious fanaticism are explored in a series of short narratives also hailing from Nigeria. Where it once centred on simplistic tropes such as good v evil, Nollywood has evolved to take on broader issues, says director Chuko Esiri, whose debut film Eyimofe (This Is My Desire) \u2013 a tale of two Nigerians who believe their lives will be better in Europe \u2013 premiered at this year\u2019s Berlin film festival. Eyimofe is also screening at Film Africa, among dramas and documentaries from Kenya, Lesotho, Sudan, South Africa and elsewhere. \u201cNollywood has become something of a catch-all for the Nigerian film industry, but there\u2019s so much more to it,\u201d said Esiri, who co-directed Eyimofe with his twin brother Arie. \u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing now is the birth of an industry that has hitherto been dominated by a particular type of film. Today, new Nollywood films are infinitely broader in scope and style. It is exciting to be part of a new generation of film-makers looking to carve out spaces beyond Nollywood.\u201d Nigeria\u2019s film industry is now the second-biggest in the world, sandwiched between Bollywood (which comes first) and Hollywood. Although Nigeria releases roughly 1,000 films a year, few currently travel far beyond the continent or the African diaspora, or get much global arthouse attention. But increased visibility on platforms such as irokotv and Netflix is helping to increase international interest \u2013 as is a new generation of film-makers keen to tackle broader themes, says film industry expert Nadia Denton, who specialises in Nigerian cinema and coined the term \u201cBeyond Nollywood\u201d to refer to new wave films, animations and short narratives that are currently marginalised in the Nigerian film industry. \u201cAs Nollywood grows, film-makers are becoming bolder in their output and increasingly seeking international audiences,\u201d Denton told the Guardian. One example is For Maria, which follows new mother Derin as she struggles with a complicated delivery, says Denton. \u201cFor Maria is unquestionably brave. Here we have a male director under 30, Damilola Orimogunje, taking on what is typically seen as a \u2018woman\u2019s issue\u2019. It would have been far easier for him to have made a romantic comedy or gangster film than a sensitive, nuanced piece about postpartum depression. \u201cThere is an emotional quality to For Maria that I have never seen from Nigeria on the big screen: the tenderness shared between the husband and wife; and the overwhelming vulnerability of the lead protagonist, who struggles to bond with her newborn. It is also the first film I have seen where a woman of African descent battles with mental health in such a visceral way. In the wake of Black Lives Matter and the Covid pandemic, For Maria struck me as having an unwitting sense of urgency.\u201d Orimogunje, who also co-wrote the script, says he chose to confront postnatal depression because it is such an overlooked issue in Nigeria, where \u201cstigma is attached to anyone who doesn\u2019t meet the supposed \u2018standard\u2019\u201d. \u201cMental health generally in Nigeria is barely discussed, and depression almost seems like a myth,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIt would rather be confused with spirituality when there\u2019s a dire need to confront it. Many people don\u2019t know so much about postpartum depression, especially the older generation. The husband\u2019s love for his wife, his support and bewilderment [are also] intended to break the patriarchal dynamics of men in African society and also in most Nollywood films.\u201d The Ghost and the House of Truth, Eyimofe and For Maria are being screened as part of the Beyond Nollywood strand at Film Africa (30 October \u2013 8 November) on the BFI Player"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
