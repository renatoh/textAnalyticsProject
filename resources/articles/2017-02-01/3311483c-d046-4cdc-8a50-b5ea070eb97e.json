Here are the key points from today: \u2022 Donald Trump revelled in his capture of America\u2019s conservative movement on Friday with a speech that carried all the anger, nativism and rampant populism of his election campaign. \u201cWe are Americans,\u201d the US president said to rapturous applause, \u201cand the future belongs to us.\u201d \u2022 The White House confirmed that its chief of staff spoke with top FBI officials about the bureau\u2019s inquiry into links between Trump\u2019s associates and Russia \u2013 a conversation which appears to violate justice department rules to ensure the integrity of investigations. \u2022 Wayne LaPierre, the leader of America\u2019s largest gun rights group, accused the federal judiciary of doing violence to the constitution by upholding an injunction against Trump\u2019s travel ban targeting people from seven Muslim-majority countries. \u2022 US Customs and Border Protection said it planned to start awarding contracts by mid-April for Trump\u2019s proposed border wall. \u2022 The White House barred several news organizations from an off-camera press briefing, handpicking a select group of reporters that included a number of conservative outlets friendly toward Trump. \u2022 Nigel Farage, one of the leading figures in the campaign to win Britain\u2019s referendum on leaving the EU, told CPAC that Brexit and the election victory of Trump were \u201cthe beginning of a great global revolution\u201d that would continue on throughout the west. Sabrina Siddiqui spoke to a number of Trump supporters here at CPAC about what they thought of his speech: Lin-Dai Kendall, from Fairfax, VA, said she had supported Trump reluctantly during the presidential race, having first backed three other candidates: Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Texas senator Ted Cruz. Her main concern had been that Trump was not sufficiently conservative. But she seemed to have embraced him. \u201cRight now, I see his agenda and it is my agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cThe media and the Democrats have absolutely flooded everything he does with criticism and no quarter to even hear his message.\u201d She added: \u201cTrump is one of us. He\u2019s flawed, like we are.\u201d Michael Conners, of Brooklyn, New York, said seeing Trump live reminded him of the former reality TV star\u2019s appeal. \u201cHe\u2019s always a little bit different. He\u2019s a little bit off the cuff \u2014 intelligent, funny. Maybe says the wrong thing every once in a while, but that\u2019s just because he\u2019s not a regular politician.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not in his personality to back down. If someone attacks him, he attacks back. You\u2019re not going to change him at this point.\u201d Many of those who took in the remarks \u2014 which featured a lengthy, scathing assault on the media that has long been a staple of Trump\u2019s stump speeches \u2014 sided with the president in his ongoing feud with the press. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the media in general,\u201d said Adrian Marcogliese, who hails from Montreal but is studying in the US. \u201cThe polls spoke for themselves when they said Trump was going to lose.\u201d The media, he added, was more invested in presenting \u201cthe information that they view in the best light for their business. And they\u2019ll have their own bias in that.\u201d Some of Trump\u2019s support came from unexpected corners, such as Dustin Hartl, a 20-year-old student who voted for Vermont senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. Hartl, who attends the University of Wisconsin Whitewater, where White House chief of staff Reince Priebus also studied, stood in the CPAC corridor after Trump\u2019s speech donning a white Make America Great Again hat. He had seen Trump speak at least four times and confessed to disagreeing with some of the president\u2019s signature policy proposals. \u201cI don\u2019t like the border wall,\u201d Hartl said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a waste of money. I think there are other things we could be putting our money towards.\u201d But he was nonetheless drawn to Trump for the same reasons he liked Sanders, whose insurgent campaign proved a more competitive challenge to Hillary Clinton that anticipated. \u201cBernie came to the establishment and shook it up. And that\u2019s what Donald Trump is doing,\u201d Hartl said. Members of the White House press pool are sending out transcripts of White House spokesman Sean Spicer\u2019s private press briefing, which was open only to hand-picked news outlets. On White House chief of staff Reince Priebus\u2019 converation with top FBI officials about the bureau\u2019s inquiry into links between Donald Trump\u2019s associates and Russia. Number one, the deputy director comes to us, we didn\u2019t go to them \u2026 The deputy director came to the chief of staff of the White House and literally said \u2018the story is false.\u2019 So here are the two scenarios. One is the chief of staff says nothing and just stares at him. Which is what some of the folks in this room believe he should have done \u2026 All we simply did was say \u2018wow, you\u2019re [inaudible] with this information, saying that something, a story in the New York Times was not accurate, so is there something that you\u2019re doing to let other journalists know it\u2019s not true, because you\u2019re asking us.\u2019 So that morning, I got let\u2019s say 5, 10, 15 phone calls from you and your colleagues saying, \u2018hey there\u2019s a report in The New York Times, what are you thinking about it?\u2019 Well if someone is coming to us, telling us that it\u2019s not a true story, Our goal was to just literally say to them, \u2018will your public affairs office take this phone call?\u2019 This notion I see on CNN about, we pushed back or we applied pressure. Pressure by definition is applying force. So if we had said, \u2018if you don\u2019t do this, if you don\u2019t do that,\u2019 that\u2019s pressure. And I get that. That would have been wrong. \u2026 And the answer was, \u2018well, we don\u2019t want to get in the middle of starting a practice of doing this.\u2019 ... Had we not done anything and just sat there, it would have been irresponsible and frankly malpractice. On Trump\u2019s connections to Russia: There are no connections to find out about. That\u2019s the problem \u2026 You can\u2019t disprove something that doesn\u2019t exist. He\u2019s talked about the fact how many times he\u2019s talked to Putin. He has no interests in Russia. On Trump\u2019s declaration he wanted to stop journalists publishing stories based on unnamed sources. Would the White House continue to brief anonymously? Sure. No, I\u2019ll give you a great example. There\u2019s a big difference\u2026 This morning was an example where we wanted to have a free-flowing exchange with reporters. At the end of the conversation several reporters said \u2018can we use some of this on the record?\u2019 We said yes \u2026 There\u2019s a big difference between making serious allegations, us coming back on the record and reporters saying \u2018well we have five sources that are unnamed that say contrary to that.\u2019 There\u2019s a point at which, there\u2019s an obligation if you\u2019re going to make a very, very serious allegation, and we\u2019re willing to push back on the record, that there be somebody at the very least that\u2019s willing to push back on this, and say that they\u2019ll put their name attached to it. On not making today\u2019s briefing on-camera: Doing a gaggle doesn\u2019t preclude us from doing something on-camera right after that. \u2026 The idea was with time being what it is today we wanted to just make sure you guys got an update \u2026 I literally have said since day one that we would have some sort of gathering every day. The president spoke today. As you know we don\u2019t generally do\u2014we haven\u2019t done briefings when the president\u2019s had a major event or an event with a world leader \u2026 And we want to make sure we answer you questions, but we don\u2019t need to do everything on camera every day.\u201d US Customs and Border Protection says it plans to start awarding contracts by mid-April for Donald Trump\u2019s proposed border wall, reports the Associated Press. The agency said Friday on a website for federal contractors that a request for bids would be published on or around March 6. Companies would have to submit \u201cconcept papers\u201d to design and build prototypes by March 10. CBP will narrow the field by March 20 and require that finalists renew their offers by March 24, with a price attached. The timetable shows that Trump is aggressively pursuing plans to build what he calls \u201ca great wall\u201d on the 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Trump told CPAC earlier today that construction would start \u201cvery soon\u201d and was \u201cway ahead of schedule\u201d. Hillary Clinton is back with a message for Democrats a day before they elect their next leader. Had she won, the choice would have been Clinton\u2019s to make. But instead, the 447 members convened in Atlanta \u2013 and Clinton is sending her well-wishes via a YouTube video. In the video, Clinton urged Democrats to rally around whomever the party chooses. \u201cWe as Democrats must move forward with courage, confidence, and optimism, and stay focused on the elections we must win this year and next. Let resistance plus persistence equal progress for our party and our country,\u201d Clinton said in the video published on Friday. Clinton\u2019s involvement in the Democratic politics has been a topic of much speculation since her devastating lost to Donald Trump. During the DNC candidates\u2019 forum earlier this week, the candidates were asked if it would be good or bad for the party if Clinton ran again in 2020. No one answered the question directly. In the video, she pledged to stay active in helping to rebuild the party. \u201cKeep fighting,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there with you every step of the way.\u201d Since you\u2019re here \u2026 \u2026 we\u2019ve got a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever, but far fewer are paying for it. Advertising revenues across the media are falling fast. And unlike some other news organisations, we haven\u2019t put up a paywall \u2013 we want to keep our journalism open to all. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian\u2019s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters \u2013 because it might well be your perspective, too. If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps to support it, our future would be much more secure. Become a Supporter or make a contribution. The Guardian was among several media organisations barred from Spicer\u2019s briefing. In response to a request to attend using a White House \u201chard pass\u201d, official Catherine Hicks emailed: \u201cNo, unfortunately a hard pass does not necessarily guarantee entry into the gaggle. The gaggle today is just today\u2019s pool with the addition of a few others here at the White House.\u201d The White House Correspondents Association (WHCA) condemned the highly unusual move. Its president, Jeff Mason, said in an email: \u201cThe WHCA board is protesting strongly against how today\u2019s gaggle is being handled by the White House. We encourage the organizations that were allowed in to share the material with others in the press corps who were not. The board will be discussing this further with White House staff.\u201d Soon after, journalists present emailed audio recordings of Spicer\u2019s briefing to a general distribution list for White House correspondents. Shortly after Donald Trump\u2019s attack on the media this morning, the White House altered arrangements for Friday\u2019s briefing with press secretary with Sean Spicer. It changed from \u201con camera\u201d to \u201coff camera\u201d and from the normal briefing room to a gathering for an \u201cexpanded pool\u201d of reporters at the briefing room doors. Reporters have been tweeting that only certain news organisations were allowed in: The New York Times reports: Journalists from The New York Times and two other news organizations were prohibited from attending a briefing by President Trump\u2019s press secretary on Friday, a highly unusual breach of relations between the White House and its press corps. Reporters from The Times, CNN and Politico were not allowed to enter the West Wing office of the press secretary, Sean M. Spicer, for the scheduled briefing. Aides to Mr. Spicer allowed in reporters from only a handpicked group of news organizations that, the White House said, had been previously confirmed to attend. Organizations allowed in included Breitbart News, the One America News Network and The Washington Times, all with conservative leanings. Journalists from ABC, CBS, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, and Fox News also attended. Whether by coincidence or by design, Xavier Becerra, California\u2019s new attorney general, and the de facto opposition leader to Donald Trump, addressed Democrats in Atlanta while the president spoke at CPAC. In an extended baseball metaphor, he described Democrats as the heavy hitters \u2014 the team that passed social security and Medicare and put a man on the moon. He urged Democrats to adopt a simpler message (like Make America Great Again) rather than a 10-point plan (\u201cGo to my website: HillaryClinton.com\u201d). \u201cIt\u2019s hard for us Democrats to believe that something so simple with just a few words like \u2018be a hitter\u2019, \u2018get in the way\u2019 can be the secret sauce of success. You know why?\u201d Becerra said. \u201cBecause we\u2019re Democrats. We overthink things,\u201d he said, drawing laughs and a lot of nods. \u201cWe tend to think the recipe for the secret sauce must be some kind of quadratic equation or something like that. It couldn\u2019t be possible it\u2019s so simple. We let our brains take over our hearts and guts.\u201d At the end of his speech, he suggested that Democrats can expect more legal confrontations with the administration, as many anticipate from his office, especially on issues of immigration. \u201cBelieve me,\u201d he said, \u201cthe strikes are coming.\u201d The temperature has plunged in this hall, and half way through LaPierre\u2019s speech all the lights went out. He says he will fight \u201cthe violent left\u201d on the internet, on TV, in Congress, in statehouses, in courthouses, from coast to coast. \u201cIf the violent left brings their terror to our communities ... they will be met with the full force of American freedom,\u201d he says, claiming \u201cwe are the majority in this country\u201d, although obviously 3m more people voted for the liberal candidate at the last US election than the conservative one. He calls on the crowd to stand up, which they do. That was probably the most alarmist, dystopian and violent speech that has been made here so far, which is all the more notable given that on the face of it what LaPierre was saying was that his side was now in the ascendent. His attacks on the left and elision of leftwing protest with crime and terrorism made Trump sound calm and measured. \u201cAmericans wanted a fighter, and we got one with President Donald J Trump,\u201d he says. And the NRA has fought for American freedom every day, says LaPierre. \u201cWe\u2019ve got President Trump\u2019s back for the next eight years,\u201d he says to cheers. If you\u2019re \u201ca member of the leftist media, a soldier for the violent left\u201d, a criminal, or a terrorist, hear this: \u201cyou are not going to win and you will not defeat us,\u201d he says. He says the media never cared about Obama\u2019s policy towards Russia, but now \u201coh my god, they\u2019re horrified, all a-fret\u201d ... and worse, he says, they seem to have found \u201cwilling co-conspirators among the intelligence community\u201d. Leaks of Trump\u2019s telephone calls risk America\u2019s national security, he claims. In the old days, if you would have done that, \u201cyou would have been tracked down and hanged for treason\u201d. Yet says media coverage of the commuting of \u201ctraitor\u201d Chelsea Manning\u2019s sentence concentrated on her \u201cunderwear and make-up return\u201d. He paints a picture of universities that silence dissent and are full of violent, angry mobs, while the police stand by. They\u2019ve got a fight on their hands, he says. \u201cThe leftist media is responsible for blowing the winds of violence as well,\u201d he says. He attacks CNN for an item on the possibility of Trump\u2019s assassination, and a journalist for the Times of London for joking about the same thing. He plays a clip of himself from the 1990s during the debate over banning assault weapons. In the clip he claims a CNN story was fake. The crowd here at CPAC cheers. He says \u201che caught them like a bank robber running out of the bag with the dye exploding all over him\u201d. \u201cOur country is under siege from a media carpet-bombing campaign,\u201d he adds. He has used an incredible array of extremely violent metaphors during this speech. \u201cThe left\u2019s violence against America has taken many forms,\u201d he says, counting \u201cjudicial activism\u201d such as the court ruling against Trump\u2019s travel ban. It\u2019s a stretch to refer to a court decision as violence. He claims the president has \u201cabsolute authority\u201d to suspend immigration in the way the order, which has now been blocked, set out. He describes this as \u201cthrowing a molotov cocktail at the US constitution\u201d. \u201cBy making the law mean anything they want, they make the law mean nothing,\u201d he says. LaPierre says we are living in an angry time. Many people want to tear things down and blow things up, he says, drawing a line from protesters, to Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, to Isis. Is it anything but a matter of time before the terror of Brussels comes to the US, he asks. \u201cWhat happens if terrorists tag along with a flashmob protest at your local airport and gas the place like they did in Tokyo?\u201d he asks. This is alarmist stuff. Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association is addressing the conference. He starts by claiming anti-Trump protesters don\u2019t know what they\u2019re protesting, wear black masks, \u201cspit in the face of gold star families\u201d, and smash windows. Footage of violent scenes is being played on the screen behind her. More than 200 protesters were arrested on the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration as thousands demonstrated peacefully. The much bigger protests in Washington and across the country the next day are believed to have been totally peaceful. Farage seems to be enjoying himself ... Meanwhile, in New York ... \u201cWe\u2019re not against anybody based on religion or ethnicity,\u201d Farage claims, although he has a record of inflammatory claims about Muslims. We are for our country and our people \u201cand we are winning!\u201d Farage says in conclusion. They like that. He repeats that 2016 is \u201cthe beginning of a great global revolution\u201d. This will roll out across the rest of the west. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some very exciting elections coming up in the Netherlands, in France,\u201d he says. I wonder how much this crowd cares about whether this \u201crevolution\u201d spreads elsewhere. Surely the key point of Trumpism is that it\u2019s all about what is perceived to be best for America, not foreigners. He claims Trump is \u201crestoring faith in the democratic process and good for him\u201d. In 2016 the nation state hit back against \u201cthe globalists\u201d, he says. Trump could not have done it alone. He had Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway \u201cand every single one of you\u201d. His favourite part of 2016 wasn\u2019t these victories, he says, it was \u201cwatching the faces of the CNN presenters!\u201d \u2013 essentially saying that achieving his life\u2019s political dream was not as satisfying as proving the media wrong. He claims Brexit is becoming more popular by the day and Trump will too (\u201cin America\u201d). Tony Blair gets a boo from a loud section of the crowd. \u201cOh, he\u2019s popular here too, then?\u201d quips Farage. He recalls sharing a stage with Trump and telling the crowd not to listen to the naysayers. \u201cI said, \u2018we got our country back on June 23, and you can get yours back too on November 8.\u2019 I am pleased and proud that I did that.\u201d He says he is proud to have been part of Trump\u2019s campaign. And he says he is seeing something quite remarkable: \u201can elected leader trying to put in place the platform on which he was elected.\u201d Wasn\u2019t Trump just superb this morning? They agree he was. Vast sections of the media said Brexit would not happen, he says, ignoring the swathes of British media that supported Brexit. We even had a visit from Obama, he says, to loud boos. Farage says he is grateful Obama intervened and told \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest friend and ally in the world ... that if we voted to get our independence we would go to the back of the line\u201d. That gets boos too. He claims this increased the poll numbers for the leave side. Farage says 2016 will be remembered for \u201cthe beginning of a global political revolution and it\u2019s one that is not going to stop, it\u2019s one that is going to roll out across the rest of the free world\u201d. He says he has fought against Britain\u2019s membership of the EU for 25 years. \u201cYou\u2019ve only had a few months of being abused, I\u2019ve had 20 years of it!\u201d he says. \u201cOur real friends in the world speak English, have common law, and stand by us in times of crisis,\u201d Farage claims. There\u2019s a standing ovation for Farage, although of course the crowd is much smaller now than for Trump. Farage says he is delighted CPAC invited him \u2013 \u201cme, a foreigner!\u201d But since Trump\u2019s election he feels more American each time he comes here, he says. He says Farage has been a mentor and a father figure. He has survived cancer, a car crash, a plane crash, BBC, CNN, and the European parliament, he says. He introduces Farage as \u201cMr Brexit\u201d. Raheem Kassam, the editor-in-chief of Breitbart London, introduces Farage, saying CPAC is \u201cabsolutely bloody fantastic\u201d. They like that. He says he was \u201cborn into a Muslim family\u201d and describes himself \u201cas a conservative, a proud Englishman and a robust Americaphile\u201d. When people ask him if he makes the Hajj, or pilgrimage, he says, yes, every year, to the Gaylord Convention Center, to CPAC. He then whips up the crowd into loud boos against the media (of which he is himself a member). He claims to have gone to \u201cno-go zones\u201d in Sweden. \u201cYou guys in the back, you just don\u2019t get it,\u201d he tells the media. \u201cYou don\u2019t go there. You don\u2019t see what\u2019s going on. Get your heads out of your rears!\u201d He adds: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, they\u2019re not all like that.\u201d Turning now to the subject of his speech, he says Farage has changed the world. Brexit was spurred by a man who loves his country and wants to secure its borders, he says. Click below to watch Farage live: Up next is Nigel Farage, the former leader of the United Kingdom Independence party (Ukip) and one of the leading figures in the campaign to win Britain\u2019s referendum on leaving the EU. Farage has ingratiated himself with Trump of late, and met him after his election before Theresa May, the prime minister, a disregard for diplomatic niceties that Trump compounded by suggesting the UK make Farage ambassador to the US. As a former holder of that post, Sir Christopher Meyer, pointed out: \u201cUK ambassador in DC exists to defend UK interests in US, not US interests in UK.\u201d Farage will be introduced by Raheem Kassam, the editor-in-chief of Breitbart London and a former aide to Farage. My colleague David Smith caught up with Farage here yesterday. He backed Donald Trump and his chief strategist Steve Bannon to the hilt over the travel ban, attacks on the media, and attitude to Russia. He said of Trump: \u201cI think it\u2019s a wonderful refreshing change to see someone who\u2019s been elected who\u2019s absolutely intent on putting his platform into policy.\u201d Donald Trump returns fairly frequently to the crime rate in Chicago, which recorded the highest annual number of homicides in more than two decades: 762, more than the figures for New York and Los Angeles combined. Yesterday he tweeted: It was the city\u2019s \u201csingle deadliest day since Christmas Day\u201d, the Chicago Tribune reported. But now Chicago\u2019s superintendent of police, Eddie Johnson, has said his department has asked the White House and Justice Department for help \u2013 and heard nothing back. \u201cWe\u2019ve made requests to the White House and the Justice Department for them to support our work \u2014 from increasing federal gun prosecution to more FBI, DEA and ATF agents to more funding for mentoring, job training and more,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cWe are still waiting for the administration\u2019s response to our request.\u201d After Trump in January said that if Chicago didn\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d its problem with violent crime, he would \u201csend in the feds\u201d, mayor Rahm Emanuel said: \u201cJust send them ... Send more FBI, DEA, ATF agents. We don\u2019t have to talk about it anymore. Just send them.\u201d That was a populist and nationalistic speech from Donald Trump, which seemed to be what the CPAC crowd were after. It didn\u2019t take much for them to erupt into chants of USA! USA! Trump made false claims about his travel ban, recent tightening of immigration enforcement, polls, and the Affordable Care Act, and unlikely ones about when building will start on the wall with Mexico and the turnout for his speech today. Clearly exercised by the run of recent leaks to the press from intelligence agencies about his administration, most recently a CNN story stating that Reince Priebus, his chief of staff, asked the FBI to deny media reports that campaign advisers were frequently in touch with Russian intelligence agents during the election, Trump gave over one of the longest passages of his speech to the media. He said the press should not be allowed to use anonymous sources, a restriction on free speech he has not suggested before. \u201cYou will see stories dry up like you have never seen before,\u201d Trump said. In a recent column, Liz Spayd, the public editor of the New York Times, gave a vigorous defence of the use of anonymous sources, which bears repeating here: Throughout history, some of those who have spoken up provided information that exposed grave government failings, and also strengthened democracy. Had the legions of unnamed not come forward, the CIA black-site prisons would never have come to light. Nor would the government\u2019s wiretapping of private citizens, or the investigations of a potential bridge between the Trump team and Moscow. Trump also attempted to drew a new distinction between \u201cfake news\u201d, which he attacked, and other parts of the media, which he said he was not opposed to. That train may well have left the station, however, judging by how frequently the term has been thrown around during this conference to describe everything from the science of climate change to past liberal predictions about the future success of Obamacare. Hillary Clinton called his voters \u201cdeplorable\u201d, he says ... and the crowd erupts into chants of \u201clock her up\u201d. The GOP will be the party of the American worker, he says. He claims \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of people have joined the Republican party since the 2016 primaries, and gives himself the credit. He says there is no global flag or anthem \u2013 prompting chants of USA! USA! again. There is a very nationalistic mood here this morning. We all bleed the same red blood, he says, and \u201cwe are all equal in the eyes of almighty God\u201d. Sticking with the religious theme, he thanks Christians, as well as \u201crabbis\u201d. With an uncharacteristic flight of rhetoric, he tells them: There is no dream to large, no task too great. We are Americans and the future belongs to us. He adds, more prosaically: \u201cAmerica is coming back. It\u2019s going to be bigger and better. It\u2019s roaring. It\u2019s going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\u201d With that, he wraps up to the sound of You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want by the Rolling Stones \u2013 the song that usually ended his campaign rallies, and which continues to be a strange choice, since its theme directly undercuts his message. Trump and the crowd applaud military veterans together. He says he will \u201cfix\u201d trade deals. \u201cYou wonder where did the people come from,\u201d who cut these deals, he muses. Replying to a shout from the crowd, he says: \u201cThey also came from campaign contributions.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what exactly he\u2019s suggesting. He gets another big cheer for saying he will protect the right to bear arms. Trump says the military is working on a plan \u201cto totally obliterate Isis\u201d and \u201ceradicate this evil from the face of the earth\u201d. He links that to \u201cborder security\u201d. \u201cForeign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they can\u2019t get in to America.\u201d In fact no one from any of the countries named in Trump\u2019s travel ban has been responsible for any attacks in the US. \u201cI took a lot of heat on Sweden,\u201d he says ruefully, referring to a false claim he made recently about a non-existent attack there, \u201cand then a day later I said: has anybody reported what\u2019s going on?\u201d He tells a story about an acquaintance who used to love Paris, \u201cthe city of lights\u201d, but no longer goes there because \u201cParis is no longer Paris\u201d. He doesn\u2019t explain exactly what he means. After a diatribe about \u201cblood-sucking consultants\u201d, he says miners are going back to work and claims they will be digging up \u201cbeautiful clean coal\u201d. Trump says he is going to protect the environment but says there are many environmental regulations that need to be cut. The close relationship between Scott Pruitt, the new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and fossil fuel interests including the billionaire Koch brothers was recently highlighted in more than 7,500 emails and other records. Fears that Donald Trump\u2019s presidency will suppress climate science at the EPA are causing widespread unease among staff. Simplifying the tax code gets a big round of applause. As Christina Wilkie of the Huffington Post points out, the White House is not averse to using anonymous sources itself, despite Trump\u2019s attack on the practice early. He claims immigration officers are finding \u201cdrug dealers\u201d, \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d ... \u201cand throwing them the hell out of our country\u201d. In fact the changes Trump has made to immigration policy mean the government is no longer focusing on those undocumented immigrants who have committed serious crimes, instead widening the potential net to people who may only have committed traffic offences, or may have only been suspected (not convicted) of a crime. \u201cWhen was the last time we won? Do we win a war? Do we win anything? We\u2019re going to win big, folks ... believe me.\u201d That prompts another burst of USA! USA! chanting. \u201cThe era of empty talk is over,\u201d Trump says. He claims building the wall with Mexico is \u201cgoing to start soon \u2013 way ahead of schedule\u201d. It\u2019s not clear what schedule or what planned building work he is referring to. He says his recent tightening of immigration policy is to get \u201cbad people out\u201d. Turning to the Middle East, he says it\u2019s in much worse shape than 15 years ago. \u201cIf our presidents would have gone to the beach\u201d for 15 years the Middle East would have been in better shape, he says. He attacks the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, Obama\u2019s health reforms, which led to 20 million people gaining health coverage. It covers \u201cvery few people\u201d, he claims falsely. His opponents lost the election, he says. \u201cHow many elections do we have to have?\u201d The fake news \u201cdoesn\u2019t represent the people\u201d, he says. \u201cOur victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before,\u201d says Trump, and he dedicates it to a \u201ccountry and people who believe in freedom, security and the rule of law\u201d. It was a win for \u201cconservative values\u201d, he says, and for everyone who believes it\u2019s time to stand up for the American worker and the American flag. That gets cheers and applause. \u201cThere are lines that go back six blocks\u201d to get into the speech, he claims. I\u2019m in the hall so I can\u2019t see whether that is true, but Trump has consistently exaggerated the numbers of people trying to get into his events. He then returns to the 2016 election, saying he likes Bernie Sanders because he attacks free trade. They make up something else, he claims \u2013 \u201cpolls\u201d. He calls CNN the \u201cCinton News Network\u201d, delighting the crowd. \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d fire the pollster ... Maybe they\u2019re just bad at polling, or maybe it\u2019s not legit.\u201d He says polls showing he would not win might have put off some of his voters from voting \u2013 a critique shared by critics of polls who think they are flawed but do not suggest they are made up. He recalls his \u201cfirst major political speech\u201d at CPAC some years ago. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even running ... and it gave me an idea!\u201d He says he would have come last year \u201cbut I was worried that at the time I was too controversial\u201d. He lists a number of his policies that contributed to that and the crowd cheers them. \u201cThe media didn\u2019t think we would win,\u201d Trump says. \u201cFake news!\u201d cries someone in the crowd. The consultants didn\u2019t either, he says. They are no good at politics \u201cbut they\u2019re really good at sucking up people\u2019s money\u201d. But, Trump says, \u201cnever underestimate the people\u201d. \u201cI want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It\u2019s fake, phony, fake. A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people and they are ... Because they have no sources. They just make them up where there are none,\u201d he claims. He talks about a recent story citing nine sources. \u201cThere were no nine people ... because I know them,\u201d he claims. But he claims he is drawing a distinction between the \u201cfake news\u201d and the media as a whole. \u201cI\u2019m not against the press ... I am only against the fake news media or press.\u201d He says: \u201cI\u2019m against the people who make up stories and make up sources. They shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody\u2019s name,\u201d he says \u2013 a restriction on free speech he has not suggested before. \u201cYou will see stories dry up like you have never seen before,\u201d he predicts. He says yesterday\u2019s Reuters report was by an \u201chonourable\u201d journalist, however. Trump arrives to Lee Greenwood\u2019s God Bless the USA. He thanks Matt Schlapp and \u201chis very incredible wife \u2013 and boss\u201d. He says he loves CPAC and will \u201cmake sure that we\u2019re here a lot\u201d. He tells the crowd to sit down. \u201cThe dishonest media will say \u2018he didn\u2019t get a standing ovation,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cYou know why? Because everybody stood and nobody sat.\u201d That gets applause and a chant of USA! USA! Mercedes Schlapp of the Washington Times and Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union which organises CPAC, arrive to introduce Trump. The couple greet each other as \u201cMr Deplorable\u201d and \u201cMrs Irredeemable\u201d. Matt Schlapp says it feels good to have someone lead the US \u201cwho knows how to fight \u2013 and he\u2019s fighting for you\u201d. He says the conference will continue to have Trump\u2019s back. The hall has filled up in anticipation of Trump and the attendees have been told that if they leave now they won\u2019t be able to get back in. A brief chant of \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d just broke out in an overflow area behind the media section. You can watch his speech live above if you refresh the page. Donald Trump has told his Twitter followers this morning he is \u201cGoing to CPAC!\u201d, but he also has other matters on his mind. In two tweets this morning he attacked the FBI for not being able to stop leakers to the media \u2013 even \u201cwithin the FBI itself\u201d. This may have been prompted by a CNN story last night stating that Reince Priebus, Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff, asked the FBI to deny media reports that campaign advisers were frequently in touch with Russian intelligence agents during the election. The FBI rejected the request, CNN reported, citing \u201cmultiple US officials brief on the matter\u201d. A White House official said the request was only made after the FBI suggested to the White House it did not believe the reports to be accurate, CNN reported. Democrats said Priebus had violated policies intended to limit communications between the law enforcement agency and the White House on pending investigations. The slew of leaks to the press from intelligence agencies about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia and many other matters, including phone calls from the president to world leaders, have enraged Trump and led to the resignation of Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. He has frequently attempted to redirect attention away from the substance of the leaks towards the leaks themselves. Hello, and welcome back to our coverage of CPAC, America\u2019s biggest conservative conference, where Donald Trump is due to address attendees this morning. The president \u2013 once a poor fit at this mecca for traditional American conservatism \u2013 seems likely to be received with open arms on Friday, judging by the people we spoke to here on Thursday. Whatever ideological differences they may once have had with him, and whatever doubts about his conservative bona fides they may still have, attendees in the main seem delighted that their team is now back in charge of the White House and Congress after eight years they regard as a disaster. \u201cI think by tomorrow this\u2019ll be TPAC!\u201d joked senior White House aide Kellyanne Conway at CPAC on Thursday. It didn\u2019t appear to be far from the truth. Attendees bounded down the hallways donning Trump\u2019s signature red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats, flitting between discussions often framed around what they dubbed a campaign by the \u201cdishonest media\u201d to discredit Trump and his administration. Richard Barrett, a 21-year-old student who identified himself as an early Trump supporter, said he felt vindicated by the pro-Trump tone that dominated CPAC\u2019s first full day. \u201cI was here last year, and this convention was pretty anti-Trump,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cIt was really funny, because everybody here was \u2018Never Trump\u2019; [they said] he\u2019s never going to win the primary, it\u2019s going to be Ted Cruz all the way.\u2019 \u201cAnd, well, here we are.\u201d Pete Logsden of suburban Washington echoed this praise. \u201cIf I was going to think of any other president to compare him with it would be Reagan, and honestly, he\u2019s more conservative in a lot of ways.\u201d Yesterday the main event for many was a rare public sighting of Steve Bannon, seen by many as the power behind the throne and the engine of Trump\u2019s ideology, which he described as \u201ceconomic nationalism\u201d. Bannon and his White House colleague Reince Priebus, who comes from the establishment wing of the party, put on a show of unity. But although Priebus, a former party chair, listed Trump\u2019s policy priorities and made it clear he was committed to trying to deliver them, it was the former Breitbart boss Bannon who seemed to truly embody the worldview of the Trump White House. And his fury at the media, which he calls the \u201copposition party\u201d, was never far from the surface. \u201cIf you think they\u2019re going to give you your country back without a fight, you\u2019re sadly mistaken,\u201d he said of the media. \u201cEvery day is going to be a fight. That is the promise of Donald Trump.\u201d Media coverage of the Trump administration would never improve, Bannon claimed, because the \u201ccorporatist, globalist\u201d nature of the media meant it was intrinsically opposed to the new president\u2019s policies. Vice-President Mike Pence and controversial White House aide Kellyanne Conway also spoke. Trump is due to speak today at about 10am ET \u2013 the White House says 10am, the agenda says 10.20am. He\u2019ll be followed later on by two other political figures who have found themselves making a sudden move from the fringes to the mainstream over the last year: National Rifle Association chief Wayne LaPierre and UK Brexit leader Nigel Farage. Here are some highlights: \u2022 About 10am ET: Donald Trump \u2022 11.55am: Nigel Farage on \u201cBrexit and what it means for the world\u201d \u2022 12.55pm: Wayne LaPierre \u2022 1.35pm: Armed and Fabulous: The New Normal \u2013 a discussion featuring many NRA representatives \u2022 2pm: Revolt of the Deplorables: Inside Election 2016 \u2022 2.20pm: John Bolton, George W Bush\u2019s ambassador to the UN \u2022 3pm: Carly Fiorina, former presidential candidate \u2022 After 5pm: Draft Sheriff Clarke for Senate event featuring Dog the Bounty Hunter and \u201cSheriff Clarke\u2019s 18 inch bobblehead\u201d \u2022 5.45pm: Repealing Obama\u2019s Banking Monstrosity and Making Money Work Again: Making Money Great Again \u2022 7.30pm: Michael Reagan, son of the former president"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
