The man in the audience took the microphone and described himself as an 84-year-old retired farmer, then argued that Biden is too old to be president and pressed him on his son\u2019s business activities in Ukraine, saying the former vice-president had \u201csent\u201d Hunter to the country to work with an energy company. Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden and the 2016 election, while holding up US military aid for Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russia, is at the heart of the congressional impeachment inquiry. Biden\u2019s son Hunter used to be on the board of a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma. The voter at the event in New Hampton, Iowa, who declined to give his name when questioned immediately afterwards by reporters, challenged Biden on the integrity of the business arrangement when he was Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president. \u201cYou sent your son over there \u2026 in order to get access for the president, or you were selling access to the president just like he [Trump] is.\u201d Biden immediately responded. \u201cYou\u2019re a damn liar, man,\u201d Biden told the man. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d Biden denied that he or his son engaged in any corrupt activity in Ukraine and told the voter to \u201cget your words straight\u201d. Biden also pushed back against the voter for questioning his age. \u201cI\u2019m not sedentary,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou want to check my shape, man, let\u2019s do pushups together here, man. Let\u2019s run. Let\u2019s do whatever you want to do. Let\u2019s take an IQ test. OK?\u201d This suggestion was met with applause from the audience. As the exchange went on, Biden then appeared to say to the voter: \u201cLook, fat.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign claimed the presidential candidate was actually saying \u201clook, fact\u201d to correct the voter\u2019s comments. But the rapid response director for the Republican National Committee, Steve Guest, quickly tweeted: \u201cJoe Biden doesn\u2019t know how to treat voters \u2026 Not only does Biden call the voter \u2018a damn liar,\u2019 he goes on to call the voter \u2018fat\u2019.\u201d The voter who challenged Biden came in for some criticism from other attendees after the spat, with one telling him to \u201cget out of here\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
