This year's St Magnus features two premieres of chamber pieces, reflecting the pre-eminence of the genre in his output. Max describes the one-movement Violin Sonata premiered by Ilya Gringolts and pianist Aleksandar Mad\u017ear in Stromness town hall as tracing an imaginary, traffic-free walk across Rome, an idea that presumably accounts for its episodic nature and sense of journey. What is most striking about the sonata is its persistently abrasive, questioning quality: this is by no means easy or indulgent music. Another single-movement work is the String Trio premiered by the Hebrides Ensemble in St Magnus Cathedral. Written as a memorial to an Orkney girl who died tragically in New Zealand earlier this year, its structure comes from Orkney fiddle music, the traditional alternation of reels and slow airs. The piece builds out from what sound like discordant fragments of fiddle music, which only at the end resolve into a moving slow air. The other new work in the programme is very different. Samagam, a concerto for sarod, chamber group and string orchestra by revered sarod player Amjad Ali Khan, was created in collaboration with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra's LAB ensemble and realised by conductor David Murphy. Cross-cultural works are difficult propositions, but this one negotiates the pitfalls better than most, though it could do with being pruned. The many raga-based sections are of variable interest, but there are memorable moments: particularly the improvised dialogue between the SCO LAB players. \u00b7 The festival ends today.
