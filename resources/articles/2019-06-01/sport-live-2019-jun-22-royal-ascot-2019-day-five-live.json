On the track the performances of Blue Point, Japan and Pinatubo will live long in the memory as well as Stradivarius, the brilliant Gold Cup winner. Off the track Aidan O\u2019Brien was a clear winner of the trainers\u2019 title and Frankie Dettori nailed the jockeys\u2019 equivalent with a superb four-timer on Thursday. Hayley Turner\u2019s win on Friday ended a 32-year drought for female riders at the meeting and the five-day fixture ended with a poignant success for King Power Racing. Let\u2019s meet back next year when the country may have changed beyond recognition but the Royal Procession will be the same. A poignant end to Royal Ascot with victory for Cleonte in the Queen Alexandra Stakes and a win for King Power Racing, founded by the late Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. 1 Cleonte (S De Sousa) 7-2 2 Pallasator (Oisin Murphy) 10-1 3 Max Dynamite (R L Moore) 10-3 Fav 11 ran Also: 11-2 Lucky Deal 4th Non Runners: 4,8 And they\u2019re off ... Younevercall is running wide and solo ... Black Corton leads the main field ... Younevercall has joined the bulk of runners now ... and goes second behind Black Corton with Max Dynamite in third ... Paddy\u2019s Motorbike is close up ... and Pilansberg is last ... Corelli is in midfield with Frankie Dettori ... Corelli makes a move ... and joins Black Corton in the lead ... and goes for home ... Max Dynamite comes there with Cleonte who just gets on top and Pallasator challenges but Cleonte wins the final race of Royal Ascot. Cleonte \u2013 10/3 Max Dynamite \u2013 5/1 Younevercall \u2013 5/1 Corelli \u2013 11/2 Lucky Deal \u2013 7/1 Pallastor \u2013 12/1 Black Corton \u2013 12/1 Coeur Blimey \u2013 28/1 Paddy\u2019s Motorbike \u2013 50/1 Jukebox Jive \u2013 80/1 Pilansberg \u2013 250/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here Willie Mullins knows how to win this and reports are encouraging about his Max Dynamite, though the nine-year-old has not been the most reliable. A chance is taken on Younevercall, whose hurdling exploits suggest he might be good enough to beat these on his Flat-racing debut. After a wind operation, he bolted up at Sandown in April. He\u2019s been fragile, so connections are reluctant to send him chasing and this is evidently an attempt to add another string to his bow. The Chester Cup did not work out for Cleonte but better is expected at a course where he has run well a couple of times, including when third to Dee Ex Bee in the Sagaro last month. Dettori ends his fine week aboard Corelli, who steps up in distance by a mile. While bred to cope, it\u2019s a lot to ask at the first attempt and he wears a hood, suggesting a need to keep him calm in order to help him conserve energy. That doesn\u2019t bode particularly well. Among the jumpers on show is Black Corton, lining up in a Flat race for the very first time. All his races for the past two years have been over fences and his jumping can help him in that sphere, so I worry about him proving one-paced in a contest without obstacles, but he should give Megan Nicholls an enjoyable spin at the very least. 1 Cape Byron (Andrea Atzeni) 7-2 Fav 2 Tis Marvellous (A Kirby) 14-1 3 Danzeno (L Dettori) 7-1 4 Raucous (Cieren Fallon) 50-1 26 ran Non Runners: 14,25,28 That result means that Frankie Dettori cannot be caught now and has won the Royal Ascot jockeys\u2019 title. And they\u2019re off ... Lake Volta and Watchable are out quickly ... and the field has split in two ... Vanburgh is close up and Gunmetal ... Cape Byron finishing strongly and lands a hefty gamble. Has Blue Point run his last race? Chris Cook has just called to say that trainer Charlie Appleby has suggested that it may well be. \u201cWe\u2019ll let the dust settle, but I\u2019m not sure what there is left to do,\u201d said Appleby in the huddle speaking to journalists after his horse\u2019s victory in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes. Cape Byron \u2013 4/1 Danzeno \u2013 9/1 Hey Jonesy \u2013 12/1 Summerhand \u2013 14/1 Gunmetal \u2013 14/1 Tis Marvellous \u2013 16/1 Stone of Destiny \u2013 16/1 Bacchus \u2013 18/1 Spring Loaded \u2013 18/1 Southern Horse \u2013 18/1 Vanbrugh \u2013 20/1 Foxtrot Lady - 25/1 Cenotaph \u2013 28/1 Soldier\u2019s Minute \u2013 28/1 Watchable \u2013 28/1 Intisaab \u2013 33/1 Lake Volta \u2013 33/1 Gifted Master \u2013 33/1 Perfection \u2013 40/1 Baron Bolt \u2013 40/1 Sir Maximillian \u2013 50/1 Raucous \u2013 50/1 Fighting Irish \u2013 66/1 Straight Right \u2013 80/1 Marnie James \u2013 80/1 Corinthia Knight \u2013 80/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here Fallout from the Hardwicke Stakes -- Defoe heading for the King George, Masar likely to go back in trip for the Juddmonte International and Nagano Gold has the Arc as his main target. Defoe\u2019s trainer Roger Varian said: \u201cHe is just a lovely horse. He is very straightforward, tries and relaxes and is getting better with age. Hopefully we can bring him back in one piece for the King George. It is up to other people to have their opinion, but I have my opinion of the horse which is very high, and he is backing that up with his performances. We are excited for the rest of the season.\u201d Charlie Appleby, who trains Masar, said: \u201c\u201cI\u2019m delighted to see him back. We had a little bit of a mishap with a bit of a stumble out of the gates and therefore it didn\u2019t materialise quite how we wanted it to. Without speaking to His Highness [Sheikh Mohammed] yet, I\u2019d imagine something potentially like the Juddmonte International, as I wouldn\u2019t mind coming back in trip. \u201cFor me he has still got plenty of boot there.\u201d For a horse with a fair record at this track, Spring Loaded was a big price when betting began on Thursday, though he\u2019s since shortened to 16-1. Paul D\u2019Arcy\u2019s veteran was an unlucky ninth in this last year on his first run of the season and beat 19 rivals to a big pot here next time out. Just 4lb higher and sharper for a Listed-race run at Windsor, he could get involved under his claiming rider. Cape Byron has been clipped to 9-2, which looks very tight for a big-field cavalry charge. He won the Victoria Cup here last month, one of several bits of good course form, and travelled strongly enough to suggest this shorter trip won\u2019t be a problem. Dettori is aboard the second-favourite, Danzeno, now eight years old. A close fifth in this from the same rating a year ago, he won on his reappearance three weeks ago. Hey Jonesy was only beaten a couple of lengths in a Group One here last year. This is only his second handicap but, on the available evidence, his rating does not look especially lenient. Bacchus won this last summer on his first run of the year and tries to turn the same trick, from just a 3lb higher mark. His stable has gone four weeks without a winner. Brilliant performance from Blue Point, quickening up in great style. 1 Blue Point (James Doyle) 6-4 Fav 2 Dream Of Dreams (D Tudhope) 12-1 3 Kachy (R Kingscote) 33-1 17 ran Also: 50-1 Speak In Colours 4th Non Runner: 4 And they\u2019re off ... Kachy is quickly away and goes clear ... Blue Point is well placed ... Emblazoned is there ... Blue Point takes the lead and is all out to beat Dream of Dreams who finishes very fast. All eyes are on Blue Point as he bids to become the first horse since 2003 to win the King\u2019s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot and follow up in the Diamond Jubilee since Choisir in 2003. Czech mate! ITV Racing\u2019s Francesca Cumani under fire ...

The French raider City Light and Bound From Nowhere, from the US, are to be feared, while other contenders have travelled from Singapore and New Zealand. But all of them may struggle to match a horse whose home is just two hours up the road at Newmarket. The Tin Man took this prize in 2017 and was a marginally unlucky fourth last year. He also won here on Champions Day in 2016 and bagged the third Group One of his career at Haydock last autumn. He should be a lot sharper for his first run back at Windsor, when he was giving weight to the first two, and looks the value in the race at 11-1. He seems to have struck up a good partnership with Oisin Murphy. It\u2019s asking a lot for Blue Point to do his thing just four days after running to a very high level on what was, at the time, rain-softened ground. He\u2019s better at five furlongs than six and today\u2019s final furlong could be a long one for him. I\u2019d like to see Tip Two Win run well and the ground is certainly coming in his favour. He was a surprise second in last year\u2019s Guineas, a head in front of Masar. It\u2019s not clear that he has the raw speed to get competitive in a top-class sprint. 1 Defoe (Andrea Atzeni) 11-4 Fav 2 Nagano Gold (C Soumillon) 25-1 3 Mirage Dancer (P J Dobbs) 6-1 8 ran Also: 12-1 Morando 4th Non Runner: 9 Extraordinary run form Nagano Gold in the Hardwicke Stakes. Badly hampered at the start and could well have won but for that \u2013 what does that say about Czech Republic racing and the talent there. Masar was another who had a bad start \u2013 it appears he stumbled at the start and collided with Nagano Gold. And they\u2019re off ... Nagano Gold was hampered at the start and Salouen leads the field in the early stages ... Masar is towards the rear ... Mirage Dancer is second ... Communique is close up ... Southern France is in midfield ... Mirage Dancer kicks for home with Masar challenging ... Nagano Gold comes late and fast but Defoe holds him off. It\u2019s getting even faster ... The return of last year\u2019s Derby winner Masar in the Hardwicke Stakes next is one of the highlights of Royal Ascot. Masar \u2013 11/4 Defoe \u2013 10/3 Southern France \u2013 9/2 Mirage Dancer \u2013 13/2 Salouen \u2013 17/2 Morando \u2013 18/1 Communique \u2013 18/1 Nadano Gold - 50/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here He was quite impressive in last year\u2019s Derby but there\u2019s no way Masar can be the right favourite for this after a year off with a leg injury. Mirage Dancer has some of the right credentials, being from the yard of Sir Michael Stoute, who has won this a record 11 times. Stoute could have run Crystal Ocean in this but switched him to the Prince of Wales on Wednesday, which he won. Was that decision made in the knowledge that he had an able substitute for the Hardwicke? Judging by his Goodwood win, in a race he also won last year, Mirage Dancer is still improving, but this requires a big step forward. Defoe is more convincing, as a Group One winner last time who nonetheless meets these rivals at level weights in a Group Two. It looks like his midwinter gelding operation has helped. His stable was among the winners yesterday. Lah Ti Dar is a non-runner, having failed to eat up, so Dettori\u2019s fans will have to sit on their hands for half an hour. Southern France has attracted support, despite being winless for over a year. He has some solid form at marathon trips, including a close second to Stradivarius last month, but this drying ground will be a problem if he\u2019s at all short of pace at this shorter distance. What Simon says ... racing starting to move with the times 1 Space Traveller (D Tudhope) 25-1 2 Space Blues (James Doyle) 5-2 Fav 3 Angel\u2019s Hideaway (R Havlin) 14-1 18 ran Also: 7-1 Urban Icon 4th And they\u2019re off ... So Perfect and Duke Of Hazzard are out fast but Marie\u2019s Diamond has the lead ... Space Blues is towards the rear ... Duke Of Hazzard challenges ... Space Blues picks up to come through but Space Traveller quickens up the best to win. And Danny Tudhope again \u2013 with his fourth winner of the week. Charlie Appleby told the Racing Post of the winner of the first: \u201cGoing forward, I think something like the Vintage [Stakes at Glorious Goodwood]would suit Pinatubo. The undulations of Goodwood can catch some horses out, but he already has experience of Epsom. You need to be able to travel at Goodwood and that seems to be one of his attributes.\u201d Space Blues \u2013 11/4 So Perfect \u2013 5/1 Urban Icon \u2013 8/1 Happy Power \u2013 17/2 Momkin \u2013 17/2 Angels Hideaway \u2013 14/1 Maries Diamond \u2013 16/1 Bye Bye Hong Kong \u2013 18/1 I Am Superman \u2013 18/1 Space Traveller \u2013 33/1 Duke of Hazzard \u2013 40/1 Western Frontier \u2013 50/1 Fire Fly \u2013 66/1 No Nonsense \u2013 66/1 Masaru \u2013 80/1 On a Session \u2013 100/1 Dubai Dominion \u2013 100/1 Air Hair Lair \u2013 500/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here. There\u2019s a lot to like about the zippy Space Blues but he does not deserve to be half the price of So Perfect. O\u2019Brien\u2019s filly was beaten less than a length in the Queen Mary here last year and later came within half a length of a Group One win against males. The horse that beat her that day was Advertise, a Group One winner again here yesterday. Having needed her first run back, So Perfect powered home at Naas last time and looks ready for seven furlongs. Space Blues has bundles of speed and will be suited by the drying surface. Momkin was a close second in the Craven and excuses could be made for his midfield effort in the Guineas. The step down in class and distance could show Roger Charlton\u2019s colt to advantage. Dettori\u2019s mount, Marie\u2019s Diamond, is of course shortening in the betting but he is winless since July, does not seem to be improving and looks held by Space Blues on Epsom form. Air Hair Lair is not good enough to get involved but it\u2019s pleasing to see his name on a Royal Ascot racecard just the same \u2013 try saying it to yourself in your poshest, most nasal voice. That was fast ... the ground definitely on the fast side of good and Pinatubo looks very useful. William Hill are 10-1 for the 2,000 Guineas. Trainer Charlie Appleby told ITV Racing: \u201cI\u2019m delighted. He came here with the right credentials. I was quite confident throughout the race. He just goes out there and does his job.\u201d Winning jockey James Doyle added: \u201cHe\u2019s a horse that shows up nicely on the gallops without setting it alight. He\u2019s a very smart horse and he travelled well. He\u2019s not slow, but I\u2019m sure up to a mile will be within his compass.\u201d 1 Pinatubo (James Doyle) 3-1 2 Lope Y Fernandez (R L Moore) 5-4 Fav 3 Highland Chief (Raul Da Silva) 14-1 14 ran Also: 33-1 Sun Power 4th Non Runners: 3,8,10 And they\u2019re off ... Rose Of Kildare and Dramatic Sands out quickly ... Lope Y Fernandez just behind the leaders ... Harpocrates now prominent ... Lope Y Fernandez has come through but Pinatubo impressively kicks clear under James Doyle for a smooth win. Lope Y Fernandez \u2013 5/4 Pinaturbo \u2013 7/2 Rose of Kildare \u2013 11/1 Year of the Tiger \u2013 14/1 Highland Chief \u2013 14/1 Heaven Forfend \u2013 20/1 Harpocrates \u2013 20/1 Dramatic Sands \u2013 28/1 Sun Power \u2013 50/1 United Front \u2013 66/1 Clay Regazzoni \u2013 66/1 Zmile \u2013 100/1 Montanari \u2013 100/1 Ardenlee Star \u2013 100/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here Lope Y Fernandez has obvious claims on his debut win but Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s second-string might be a better option and not for the first time this week. Year Of The Tiger ran a promising race in second the same day, looking as though this step up in trip was needed, and his pedigree promises much. The trainer seems to have developed a soft spot for this race, which he has won twice in the past three years, and only ran a 14-1 shot on the other occasion. Pinatubo is unbeaten in two, most recently in the Woodcote at Epsom, when he ran on strongly, suggesting this extra furlong will be fine. That form does not look strong, however. Rose Of Kildare, the mount of Frankie Dettori, has been steadily cut from 25-1 down to 7s with some firms. Mark Johnston\u2019s filly is the most experienced in the field after five runs and Liberty Beach, who beat her last time, was a good fourth in the Queen Mary here on Wednesday. 1st Green 5-2 The sectional timing, sponsored by Longines, has been an excellent addition to Royal Ascot this week and expert race times analyst and Racing TV pundit James Willoughby has been giving his reaction: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen throughout the week that the way that races are run varies considerably and can have a profound impact on important races. Every section of a race requires, in theory, equal effort from the horse, but that\u2019s not the way races are run. Races are run in a manner that some parts are run much more strongly than others, and horses who gain lengths in those sections need to be upgraded against those who gain their lengths when the pace is slow. \u201cThe difference between the two things is impossible to tell with the eye. The final time of a horse race is fairly pointless, but sectionals help us to understand them to a point where we can catch lightning in a bottle.\u201d Willoughby is still analysing this week\u2019s data but said: \u201cI think Laurens, though only sixth in the Queen Anne, ran an absolute screamer, and that the St James\u2019s Palace winner Circus Maximus should be rated as having won by much further, whereas some analysts believe runner-up King Of Comedy was unlucky. \u201cThe St James\u2019s Palace was slowly run early, but they ran very hard round the bend and into the straight and Circus Maximus put in a huge amount of effort to burn off Too Darn Hot and make it easier for the second and fourth-placed Skardu to close on him. The sectionals for the Norfolk were interesting too, and I believe the winner A\u2019Ali, put in the fastest single furlong so far.\u201d Gay Kelleway, who was the first female rider to win a race at Royal Ascot 32 years before Hayley Turner yesterday, posted this earlier today. As one response to this tweet puts it ... Miaow! Frankie Dettori 7 wins Ryan Moore 5 Danny Tudhope 3 Jim Crowley 1 Oisin Murphy 1 James Doyle 1 Pierre-Charles Boudot 1 Harry Bentley 1 Richard Kingscote 1 Seamie Heffernan 1 David Egan 1 Hayley Turner 1 Dettori has now matched his best ever Royal Ascot of 21 years ago, when one of his winners was Kayf Tara in the Gold Cup. He has six chances to set a new personal best, including the fancied Danzeno and Corelli at the end of the card. Moore has two favourites and a second favourite as he seeks to get the two more winners he needs. If the pair end the day tied, Moore wins on a countback of second places, of which he has six to the Italian\u2019s three. Evidently, the bookies don\u2019t expect that, as Moore is 7-2 while Dettori is 1-5 to hold on. Silvestre de Sousa, who is having a tough week, has four second places. Aidan O\u2019Brien 5 wins Sir Michael Stoute 2 John Gosden 2 William Haggas 2 Mark Johnston 2 Andrew Balding 1 Charlie Hills 1 Charlie Fellowes 1 Roger Varian 1 Ian Williams 1 Charlie Appleby 1 David O\u2019Meara 1 Simon Crisford 1 Ralph Beckett 1 Martyn Meade 1 Francis-Henri Graffard 1 O\u2019Brien seems set fair for another Royal Ascot title, as Stoute only has three runners left, while Haggas has none. Gosden has four and Johnston has five but O\u2019Brien has as many as those two put together. It has been a fine week for the Irishman, though he has had seven beaten favourites along the way (Hermosa, Ten Sovereigns, Magical, Fleeting, Norway, I Can Fly, Magic Wand). The way Michael Stoute campaigns his two-year-olds is as fascinating as his older horses and here\u2019s an interesting stat from the Racing Posts\u2019s Lee Mottershead. Line of Duty comes to Royal Ascot The Telegraph reported today (you can read the full story below in my original tweet) that Bet 3565 was taking the unusual step of turning down multiple bets on Frankie Dettori\u2019s rides after his 449-1 four-timer on Thursday. It seems it\u2019s spreading. 1st Carriage THE QUEEN The Duke of York The Hon. William Vestey Mr. John Warren 2nd Carriage General Sir Adrian Bradshaw Lady Bradshaw Sir Peter Vela Lady Vela 3rd Carriage Mr. Ben Case Mrs. Ben Case Mr. Clive Webb-Carter Mrs. Clive Webb-Carter 4th Carriage Mr. Mark Etherington The Lady Alexandra Etherington Mr. Chris Waller Mrs. Chris Waller I attended a Serpentine gallery exhibition by artist Mark Wallingerback in 1994 when one of his installations, called \u2018Royal Ascot\u2019, consisted of a series of video monitors on top of wheeled flight cases, each isolating the royal carriage\u2019s leisurely progress down the track on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (respectively, as it was then) of the meeting with the added TV commentary. The British Council described the work thus: \u2018Simultaneous footage exposes precise choreography: the Queen\u2019s frozen smile and rigid curls, the tilt of her head, her gloved wave, the Duke of Edinburgh raising his top hat, the national anthem striking up. Appropriately for an event whose media coverage focuses on the parade of hats and dresses rather than the sport, here we have a close-up on clothes, on the Queen\u2019s dolly mixture of pinks, tangerines, limes; the difference from day to day is barely discernible, just as the four BBC commentaries merge in a confused blather. This repetition of imagery, all backed by bright green turf, brings into play Andy Warhol\u2019s late screenprints of Elizabeth II from his \u2018Reigning Queens\u2019 series (1985), a quartet of the postage stamp icon in camp conjugations of Hollywood make-up and bubblegum colours.\u2019 The Duke of Edinburgh, who has retired from royal duties and apparently hated his trips down the road from Windsor Castle to the races, is missing but little else has changed including the blather. This is last year\u2019s Royal Procession on the Saturday \u2013 see if you can spot the difference. This is a great little feature with some terrific pics on Ireland\u2019s junior jockeys in the Observer tomorrow. Take a look ... As revealed yesterday, Ladbrokes have given up on this having been stung this week. William Hill are still joining in and report good money for yellow, from 5-1 in to 3\u2019s, Rupert Adams stating: \u201cWe know the Queen is a favourite of yellow and we think she will roll it out for the final day of the Royal meeting.\u201d \u201cThis year\u2019s hat stakes have taken an interesting turn as bookies, again, suspended betting this morning, said a spokesperson for W2.bet. \u201cPink was a very popular pick yesterday and got punters back on track after some interesting turns this week. But in the end, so far, the hat stakes have been won by punters. Today\u2019s favourite is yellow, followed by white/cream and then purple.\u201d Frankie Dettori\u2019s getting rides everywhere now! Many thanks to all who took part in our tipping competitions this week! Our winners will be contacted by email by Monday. They were: Tuesday: fallguy99 Wednesday: melonk Thursday: JimmyDeuce Friday: mycopia23 We\u2019re not running a tipping competition today, as we\u2019ve found in the past that Saturday attracts fewer players. But do please share your selections and fancies below. If enough people get involved, we\u2019ll review this for next year. You want to know what\u2019s going to win, right? Here are our selections for the final day at Royal Ascot. Stay here and we\u2019ll have an in-depth preview for every race as the afternoon goes on. 2.30 Chesham Stakes Year Of The Tiger 14-1 3.05 Jersey Stakes So Perfect (nap) 5-1 3.40 Hardwicke Stakes Defoe (nb) 7-2 4.20 Diamond Jubilee Stakes The Tin Man 11-1 5.00 Wokingham Handicap Spring Loaded 14-1 5.35 Queen Alexandra Stakes Younevercall 6-1 But never mind those, let\u2019s talk about the five winners on Friday ... If I could live a day\u2019s racing over and over, it would be that one. And I have no regrets about the Sandringham, which I always find difficult; there is just no way I could have picked Thanks Be. So I dare say today will be a 0/6 and bump back to Earth, but I still like the look of a few of these, especially So Perfect, who seems strong in the betting. Spring Loaded\u2019s price has collapsed, at last in part because the influential Hugh Taylor has also put him up. Younevercall seems popular. I\u2019m surprised The Tin Man is so big, having so much good course form to his name. Mark your card. These are not turning up, for the various reasons outlined. 2.30pm Chesham Stakes 3 DARK KRIS (Going) 10 MOHICAN HEIGHTS (Going) 3.40pm Hardwicke Stakes 9 LAH TI DAR (Self Certificate, Not Eaten Up) 5.00pm Wokingham Heritage Handicap 14 MERHOOB (IRE) (Going)2 5 ALBA POWER (IRE) (Vet\u2019s Certificate, Lame) 28 RECON MISSION (IRE) (Going) 5.35pm Queen Alexandra Stakes 8 LE MAITRE CHAT (USA) (Going) The going for the fifth day of Royal Ascot 2019 has changed to Good, Good to Firm in places (from Good on the straight course and Good, Good to Soft in places on the round course at the end of Friday) It has been dry since racing on Wednesday when there was 10 millimetres of rain. A dry and sunny day is forecast, with temperatures up to 22 degrees Celsius. Chris Stickels, clerk of the course at Ascot, said at 9.00am: \u201cIt is a lovely, bright, dry and sunny morning. We have now been dry since Wednesday and the track is drying out really nicely.\u201d GoingStick Readings at 8.15am today: Stand side: 8.2, Centre: 8.4, Far Side: 8.1.

It\u2019s the people\u2019s day, insofar as any day at this venue can ever carry such a label, when more folk are able to attend and a crowd of around 70,000 packs out the stand. More than any other day this week, the train takes the strain, as an estimated 30,000 normally travel here by the Waterloo-Reading line on the Saturday of the Royal meeting, so we will find out how much disruption is caused by the continuing industrial action by rail staff. The Queen\u2019s track is bathed in warm sunshine and we finally have the sort of weather you\u2019d like to expect in mid-June. The famously free-drying track is described as good to firm in places and GoingStick readings also suggest that any horses in need of soft are basically sunk. This is a day to be backing zippy types with quick actions who float across the turf, raising memories of Danehill, Habibti and other great sprinters with their names on the trophies here. Speaking of greats, Frankie Dettori is back, trying to find the one extra winner he needs to make this his best Royal Ascot ever at the age of 48. I\u2019m afraid he is one down already, as Lah Ti Dar, his intended mount in the Hardwicke, has been withdrawn after failing to eat up. I\u2019ve already heard one punter talking of combining the Italian\u2019s mounts in multiple bets - but first he must find a bookie still prepared to take such bets. Hayley Turner is not here, alas. Yesterday, she became only the second female jockey to ride a winner at Royal Ascot but today her business takes her to Newmarket and Lingfield. The only woman riding here is Megan Nicholls, booked by her father for Black Corton in the very last race. Black Corton is not without his chance in the Queen Alexandra, his very first Flat race, and it will be remembered that he has done several good turns for another female jockey, Bryony Frost, who won her first Grade One on him two Christmases ago. But the meat of the afternoon is the two sprints, the classy Diamond Jubilee at 4.20pm and the unsolveable Wokingham at 5pm. They are Royal Ascot in miniature, over before you know it after a tonne of preparation. But the memories will be sweet if you can pinpoint either winner.
