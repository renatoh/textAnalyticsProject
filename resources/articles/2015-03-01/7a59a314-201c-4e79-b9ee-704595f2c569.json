Manning has taken on the might of the US military, challenging its ongoing refusal to refer to her as a woman, and won. A court order from the US army court of criminal appeals instructs the military to refer to the soldier in all future official correspondence either using the gender neutral \u201cPrivate First Class Manning\u201d or employing the feminine pronoun. As a result, the military is henceforth forbidden from referring to Manning as a man. The court order marks another advance towards Manning\u2019s goal of gender transition which she has had to fight every step of the way in the face of an intransigent army hierarchy. Last month, Manning, who has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, was allowed to start hormone treatment, having struggled for years to convince her jailers to grant her the medical care that had been indicated. The treatment marked a breakthrough for the US military, which continues to ban transgender individuals from service. Manning was allowed to change her name legally from her male designation at birth \u2013 Bradley \u2013 in April last year. Even so, army lawyers continue to contest her new identity. Last month the US government filed a formal objection to Manning\u2019s request to be referred to as a woman in all future filings. In its submission to the court, government lawyers pointedly referred to the soldier as Bradley, and said that \u201cunless directed otherwise by this honourable court, the government intends to refer to [Manning] using masculine pronouns\u201d. Manning\u2019s legal advisers were jubilant about the outcome of the challenge. Nancy Hollander, who is leading the soldier\u2019s appeal against conviction, said it was \u201can important victory for Chelsea, who has been mistreated by the government for years\u201d. Chase Strangio, a staff attorney with the ACLU who pressed a lawsuit against the army to force it to allow her hormone treatment, said that the court had \u201ccourt rightly recognized that dignifying Chelsea\u2019s womanhood is not the trivial matter that the government attempted to frame it as. This is an important development in Chelsea\u2019s fight for adequate medical care for her gender dysphoria.\u201d Manning, who writes for the Guardian from her confinement in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, has written that \u201ca doctor, a judge or a piece of paper shouldn\u2019t have the power to tell someone who he or she is \u2026 We should all be able to live as human beings \u2013 and to be recognized as such by the societies we live in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
