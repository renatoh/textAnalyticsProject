It includes a raucous, stomping Leaving of Liverpool from Shane MacGowan, and an extraordinary treatment of Shenandoah featuring growled vocals from Tom Waits, with backing vocals and twanging guitar from Keith Richards. Then there's a sturdy ballad from Patti Smith and Johnny Depp, a previously unheard Frank Zappa instrumental from the 1960s, decidedly dodgy vocals from Iggy Pop and a powerful treatment of Brecht/Weill's Pirate Jenny from Brooklyn singer Shilpa Ray, backed by Nick Cave. Martin Carthy and family aren't featured this time, but British contributions include gutsy shanties from Richard Thompson and Robyn Hitchcock, and a fine accordion-backed lament from Marc Almond. Patchy, maybe, but for the most part it's enormous fun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
