Jennifer Lawrence got that memo, but decided to disregard it. In a recent interview she recalls her \u201cbutt-scratchin\u2019\u201d on sacred rocks while shooting Hunger Games in Hawai\u2019i. They were, to her mind, a useful tool to relieve her of itchiness. In the comments, which she made on a recent episode of the BBC\u2019s Graham Norton Show this week, she says: \u201cThere were \u2026 sacred \u2026 rocks \u2014 I dunno, they were ancestors, who knows \u2014 they were sacred.\u201d She goes on to say: \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to sit on them, because you\u2019re not supposed to expose your genitalia to them\u201d. But she did. \u201cI, however, was in a wetsuit for this whole shoot \u2013 oh my god, they were so good for butt itching!\u201d She knew this was a gross cultural breach \u2013 that much is clear \u2013 but Lawrence decided to go ahead and desecrate the rocks anyway. A p\u014dhaku (stone) can be sacred for a number of reasons. In some cases it is because it may be the physical manifestation of a deity or ancestor. In other cases, it may have to do with the purpose of the rock \u2013 such as birthing stones imbued with mana (spiritual power) of the chiefs. None of these things mattered to Lawrence. Lawrence\u2019s story shores up a long line of Hollywood productions that have mocked traditional Hawaiian spiritual beliefs. As scholar Lisa Kahaleole Hall notes in an essay titled: \u201c\u2018Hawaiian at Heart\u2019 and other fictions,\u201d Hawaii 5-0 and Magnum PI in the 1970s and 80s and Survivor today, set the stage for this attitude. Meanwhile, cable programming on Nick at Nite \u201chas introduced a whole new generation to the \u2018secret kahuna curse\u2019 raised when the Brady Bunch went to Hawaii.\u201d This has to do with the kitsch-factor that continues to plague Kanaka Maoli \u2013 indigenous Hawaiians \u2013 and Hawai\u2019i. As Hall puts it: \u201cThis has significant political implications, because by making Hawaiianness seem ridiculous, kitsch functions to undermine sovereignty struggles in a very fundamental way. A culture without dignity cannot be conceived of as having sovereign rights, and the repeated marketing of kitsch Hawaiian-ness leads to non-Hawaiians\u2019 misunderstanding and degradation of Hawaiian culture and history.\u201d Also, the retelling of this story for entertainment value makes Hawaiians and our ancestors \u201cthe butt\u201d of her joke. Consider her response when the p\u014dkahu \u2013 which she describes as a giant boulder \u2013 was dislodged and supposedly almost killed the sound technician on the set when it rolled down the mountain. As she tells it: \u201cAll the Hawaiians were like, \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s the curse\u2019. And I\u2019m in the corner going, \u2018I\u2019m your curse.\u2019 I wedged it loose with my ass.\u201d It is high time that people realize that despite the unbridled colonial violence of modernity, for many indigenous individual and peoples, the sacred persists in our 21st century world. \u201cMni Wiconi\u201d (Water is life in Lakota) is the banner for many of the indigenous individuals, tribal nations and other collectives working to protect sacred water, the source threatened by DAPL. They have brought their understandings of the sacred into the mainstream \u2013 though there is still much work to do. Settler colonialism has historically deemed non-Christian concepts of the sacred as a form of savage superstition. This thinking persists today. That\u2019s why we who are indigenous must assert and claim our sovereign and spiritual connections to our respective deities and ancestral realms \u2013 regardless of others\u2019 laughter and dismissal. In the mean time, Lawrence should learn to scratch herself some other way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
