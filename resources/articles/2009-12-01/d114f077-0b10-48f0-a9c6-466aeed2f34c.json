There's also a competition for loyal listeners \u2013 up for grabs is a Le Donk &amp; Scor-zay-zee prize pack, with a mug, DVD and poster signed by director Shane Meadows. Just listen to the montage of four directors who have featured in In the Director's Chair, identify them and email your answers to film.weekly@guardian.co.uk by 5 January 2010. Looking back over the year, both critics agree that 2009 was a great year for small films that said big things, while Hollywood enjoyed huge commercial success but appeared to have nothing to say. The long-awaited release of Avatar signalled a change in format, yet did not change the way we see the world. And then it's down to the main order of business: Jason and Xan's choices range from disco fantasies in Pinochet-era Chile to baseball dreams in the Dominican Republic, 70s politics in Italy to a legendary battle in medieval China. Their picks also examine the leadup to the war on terror and its effects on the ground in Iraq. Drum roll please, for their top 10 lists.
