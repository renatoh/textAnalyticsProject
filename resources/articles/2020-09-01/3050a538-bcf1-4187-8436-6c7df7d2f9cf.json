On a climate-focused episode of Q+A, the Atlassian cofounder also criticised the government\u2019s promised \u201cgas-led recovery\u201d and said it was \u201claughable\u201d Australia did not have a 2050 emissions target. China is the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, but last week, Chinese president Xi Jinping delivered a shock announcement to the UN that the country would become carbon neutral by 2060. On Monday\u2019s Q+A program, Cannon-Brookes said this spelled doom for Australia\u2019s fossil fuel industry, in a year when already more coal power stations closed than opened globally for the first time. \u201cIf we already worried about our fossil fuel industry, we should be even more worried,\u201d he said. \u201cChina will not only get out of importing coal and importing gas and over the next 40 years, but for coal, it\u2019s in the next 20 years. \u201cThey will get out of Australian products of those even faster,\u201d he said. He said China would also boost its own domestic supply of coal, which would help its own economy while harming Australia\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s not purely around the climate change angle for then, it is about putting their economy in the best position,\u201d the tech billionaire said. Nationals MP Darren Chester disagreed, telling the panel that China was \u201cstill building more coal-fired power stations\u201d and \u201cwill still require Australian coal for the foreseeable future\u201d, but Cannon-Brookes said the minister was \u201cbeing clever with the numbers\u201d. He told host Hamish Macdonald the Chinese government would not build all the coal power plants they have planned. \u201c[Chester] is also not mentioning that 2020 is the first year in the history of the world where coal-fired power generation is less than the year before,\u201d Cannon-Brookes said. \u201c2019 will be the peak. \u201cThe world is generating less energy from coal in 2020 than 2019, for the first time ever. It will continue to go down from here, including China.\u201d The Atlassian cofounder also continued to berate Chester, after the minister said the government could not set a 2050 emissions target, because \u201cit would be unfair to set a target for 2050 without saying how we would do it or pay for it\u201d. Brookes told the panel: \u201cI find it laughable when politicians say they\u2019re not into long-term planning. That\u2019s the job. Planning what the nation is going to do over 20, 30 years. We build roads for 20 or 30 years. We don\u2019t know how to pay for it? That\u2019s bunkum.\u201d China expert and former government advisor Yun Jiang said that China\u2019s renewables pledge could be trusted, even though the Chinese government had lied about other promises, because it was in the country\u2019s own self-interest. \u201cChina has committed a lot of human rights violations in Hong Kong, in Xinjiang, Tibet, and now we\u2019re seeing it in inner Mongolia as well,\u201d Jiang said. \u201cBut I agree with [journalist] Marian [Wilkinson] as well that China tends to act in its interest, and I think that, in terms of climate, it is in its interest to act now.\u201d Later in the program, Macdonald grilled Labor\u2019s shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, over whether Labor was \u201cflip-flopping\u201d on its support for fossil fuels, including gas. Chester accused Labor of being split on the issue, saying that Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon was \u201cgoing freelance\u201d and \u201crunning policy from the Hunter\u201d. \u201cMark would have a lot more credibility talking about emissions targets if Labor had one for 2030,\u201d Chester said. \u201cThey can\u2019t even agree on the 2030 target. Now they\u2019re talking about 2050.\u201d Questioner John Butler from Windella Downs in the Hunter Valley also said he had heard \u201ca lot of misgivings\u201d from the coalmining area that Labor was \u201crushing\u201d to renewable energy. Butler said Labor was still reviewing its energy policy, as part of a promise from leader Anthony Albanese after the party lost the 2019 election. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of developing our policy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not flip-flopping on a particular target. We\u2019re still developing our policy in relation to the target.\u201d Butler said gas was \u201can important part of society and the economy\u201d, but he thought the government\u2019s plan \u201c[doesn\u2019t] constitute anything like an economic recovery strategy\u201d. Cannon-Brookes was scathing of the gas-led recovery plan, saying it went against the science on reducing emissions. He said using gas as a transition fuel on the way to renewables was supported, but the government\u2019s plan would lead to long-term gas extraction. \u201cGas power plants we have today, we need to keep them running for their useful life as a transition to are renewables, and we\u2019ll get there. \u201c[But] if you ask [chief scientist] Alan [Finkel] if massive amounts of gas extraction is good for our climate emissions goals, he\u2019d say it\u2019s terrible.\u201d Jiang, who went to high school in the Hunter, said the region would adapt to new industries, including renewables, without fossil fuels. \u201cI remember when BHP was shut down in Newcastle and many people lost their jobs, but over the next few years, it recovered,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were new companies, there were new industries.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
