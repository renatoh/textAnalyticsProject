Those days are long gone and such opinions quietly forgotten. Should the Blackburn midfielder journey to South Africa this summer, it will be as a tourist rather than a member of Fabio Capello's squad but Birmingham swiftly discovered Dunn is far from a spent force. On an evening illuminated by two of the Premier League's more mercurial talents, Dunn and Birmingham's James McFadden, the former scored twice and had another eye-catching effort controversially disallowed while McFadden also struck with a venomous free-kick. It was not enough to prevent a suddenly stuttering Birmingham slipping to another defeat as Blackburn took a major stride toward banishing any lingering relegation fears. \"We're not mathematically safe yet,\" said Sam Allardyce. \"But I think we can start looking up not down.\" Alex McLeish was left shaking his head. \"We totally dominated a lot of the game, David Dunn's a good player though,\" said Birmingham's manager. Allardyce is a little miffed with those Rovers fans who appeal in vain for him to configure his team in an attack-minded 4-4-2 formation. \"It is an antiquated system,\" he snorted. \"It doesn't work in the Premier League any more.\" It took only five minutes before Dunn's scoring burst from the home midfield quintet served to vindicate his manager's debatable case. When a long forward punt was controlled superbly by Nikola Kalinic, Dunn accelerated smoothly forward before half-volleying Kalinic's ball beyond Joe Hart with his left foot. For a short spell after that Dunn's old team looked distinctly wobbly but, gradually, McLeish's players pulled themselves together. Jason Brown, deputising for the injured Paul Robinson in Blackburn's goal, performed wonders to repel a deceptively curving McFadden shot. Sometimes operating as an orthodox striker alongside Cameron Jerome and sometimes dropping considerably deeper into a Dunn-esque midfield role, McFadden's clever movement saw Allardyce's centre-halves, Christopher Samba and the 18-year-old Phil Jones, fully extended. Not about to be upstaged, Dunn continued to exert an even more debilitating effect on Birmingham's defence, regularly feinting to go right before veering left. While one inspired interchange with El Hadji Diouf will linger in the memory, he alsobegan celebrating a second goal after another late, visionary, dash into the box to score with a stunning volley.Unfortunately, though, that effort was disallowed for Michel Salgado's foul on Lee Bowyer in the build-up. Furious, Dunn exchanged harsh words with Salgado as his team-mates trooped off at half-time. McFadden seized a little of the second-half limelight. When Birmingham won a free-kick just outside the area after Morten Gamst Pedersen's foul on Johnson it seemed ideally positioned for delivery by the forward's left foot. Sure enough a swipe of that boot from McFadden sent the ball arcing over Allardyce's crumbling wall before dropping perfectly into the far bottom corner. Brown did not move, remaining rooted to his line at the near post. A personal gauntlet had been thrown down and, when Diouf whipped in a corner, Dunn threw himself forwards to head beyond Hart from close range. McLeish claimed the corner was not taken from the quadrant but Allardyce merely shrugged. \"The difference tonight was David's outstanding quality,\" he said. \"He should have had a hat-trick, his volley shouldn't have been disallowed. It was a great shame a finish as good as that didn't stand.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
