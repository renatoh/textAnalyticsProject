They rapidly craft a new image, whether via a new partner, new friends or by shedding a few stone and acquiring a new body. Its neighbourhoods are constantly being reinvented too. Walking around SoHo's glamorous bistros and boutiques it is difficult to imagine that a few decades ago the area was urban blight that the city wanted to knock down and build a freeway through. Harlem used to be a byword for racial tension and crime. Now it is one of the hottest real estate markets in Manhattan and a target for nothing more dangerous than yuppification by the hip, young (mostly white) couples moving there. The meat packing district was home to burly workers from New Jersey and packs of transvestite hookers. Both tribes have been displaced by hordes of clubbers. But nowhere has been so jarringly reinvented as the Bowery. The broad street that winds through the East Village into the Lower East Side was America's original Skid Row. For a century it was where New York's homeless and hostile gathered. It had 100 'flophouses' or cheap hotels for the down-and-out. It was celebrated for its seediness, brothels and second-rate theatres. Luc Sante, in his book Low Life, called it 'the last stop on the way down'. But for all its harshness the Bowery did provide inspiration, music, art and a dangerously good time for some. It gave birth to the infamous punk club CBGBs, where the Ramones and Patti Smith got their big breaks. It harboured beatnik poets, writers and artists. Poetry sessions were held in bars between the brothels and heroin shooting galleries. Well, that old Bowery has gone. It is now home to a plague of hyper-expensive apartment buildings so that far from hosting the poor and the homeless, the area is home to millionaires. One huge development is a $350m (\u00a3186m), 14-storey monolith that houses a vast organic food shop on its ground floor. At the Bowery's northern tip sits a futuristic loft building pretentiously called the Sculpture for Living. Its apartments sell for up to $12m. All around are plush bars and fancy restaurants. A-list celebrities party in Bowery hotspots such as the B Bar, and some have even bought bits of it. Denzel Washington and Lenny Kravitz jointly own the Kos bar. Sometimes the new development seems a brutal insult to the city's past. Apparently the owners of the new swanky club Mission have little sense of irony. 'It is just two doors down from the famous Bowery Mission, one of the few remaining homeless shelters. As New York magazine rightly said: 'Taste this bad should be punished... avoid.' But there is some sense of continuity. The louche Slide, on the Bowery near Great Jones Street, looks like any other trendy new bar complete with low lighting. But it still has a sleazy saloon vibe. It bears the name of a wild and debauched bar that stood on the same spot in the 1890s. And every Thursday it hosts an 'underwear only' dance party. At least some things never change. Bill's birthday bashes put Hillary in shade Hillary Clinton could do with some help getting positive PR in a city where everyone thinks she will run for the White House and no one thinks she can win. An opportunity might arise in the next few months as husband Bill goes on an orgy of partying ahead of his 60th birthday. Humbly called '42 at 60' (Clinton was America's 42nd president, geddit?) the celebrations began last Thursday and will last two months. They will take place in New York and Toronto, and culminate in a private Rolling Stones gig at the Beacon Theatre in Manhattan. The event will be filmed by director Martin Scorsese. The celebrations finally end on 29 October, three days after Hillary's 59th birthday. Proof, if further proof were needed, that getting out of Bill's shadow is not easy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
