Don't read on if you haven't seen episode six. Catch-up with Richard Vine's episode five blog A bunch of old drawings done by a crazy man Agent Not-Anya-After-All is not the only one having the rug pulled from under her tonight. After all the blood shed in search of the Utopia manuscript, it's Jessica who has been the Network's real target. And after all her \"help\" along the way, Milner is revealed as the big bad at the top of the Network's committee, pulling the Assistant's strings. Elsewhere, Dugdale, Wilson, Ian, Becky and Alice all end up in places we didn't expect to find them at the start of the finale. 'Jessica. It is so good to meet you' Milner knew Carvel had hidden the real secret of Janus (\"my greatest achievement\") in Jessica's DNA, not the manuscript. But instead of hunting her down, Milner slowly lured her in with the promise of getting her hands on her father's last work. After blocking the door to the roof (with a yellow broom), Jessica stared at the drawings one last time, and then set fire to them, the picture of herself as a tiny girl lost forever. \"Janus is gone,\" she announced as the pages burned. Cue Milner's gun, and a bullet in the leg. \"Sorry. I don't want you jumping.\" Ice cold to the last. 'Wilson \u2013 you just found Mr Rabbit' Wilson tracks him down online, but it's Grant who has the final encounter. The Assistant was Mr Rabbit after all \u2013 and he was, as Milner explains, \"a man so dedicated to the cause that he'd carve lines into his own flesh to act as cover\". So was the idea of \"Mr Rabbit\" just an elaborate tale in case anyone got close enough to have a look under his tailored three-piece suits? Grant brings him down, crafting an improvised shiv out of the inside of a laptop. After Alice's shotgun showdown, another underage killer inadvertently created by the Network. For once, Grant's emotions seemed to register with Jessica, who managed not to roll her eyes when she hugged him. 'I have a situation. I need to speak to control' There's no baby Dugdale. A lot of commenters have had Jen Dugdale down as a Network plant \u2013 but did anyone suspect Anya? I loved the way this played out, with a bewildered Dugdale watching Anya chop Ian down, then asking her if her name was even Anya at all, and then realising that their baby is a lie. It's a storyline that's been there from the start, hidden in plain sight, priming Dugdale to fulfil his Network-assigned destiny. They're nothing if not sticklers for bureaucracy: one of the final requirements for authorising the Russian flu vaccine is \"an independent test verified by a civil servant\" \u2013 specifically the \"private secretary with responsibility for procurement\". Yes, that's Dugdale. The realisation that he has been set up all along is also enough of a push for him to join the rest of the gang. He's just in time to identify \"the man running Corvadt\" \u2014 no need for Jessica to head out on a killing spree. He also knows the location of the vaccine, which is stored in one of those Indiana Jones-sized warehouses. 'We better get started, you and I \u2013 we have so much to do ...' The end, then, and for once in the world of hyperreal, sci-fi flavoured genre TV we've had a lot of big questions answered. \"Where's Jessica Hyde?\" There! \"Who's Mr Rabbit?\" The Assistant \u2013 but never mind him! \"What do they want?\" To save us by killing most of us off! So is there enough left for Utopia to return? As well as finding out what Milner will do now that she's captured Jessica, there are a few other loose ends. Is Wilson dead? Where's Becky off to? Will Grant keep his goth look? What was Ian doing living with his mum in the first place? As many of you have noted, the DVD box describes what we've just watched as \"series 1\" \u2014 which suggests that we are are in for at least one more. There's been an interesting debate in your comments about whether it would be better to come back or leave it here; the latter view is interesting \u2013 \"don't ruin it with more\" \u2013 a different fan reaction from other genre shows (Firefly etc) that ended after short runs. Maybe it's the difference between a show you enjoy being cancelled and a show you enjoy arriving at what feels like a deliberate end? Notes, quotes and queries \u2022 \"Holy bloody sweaty bollocks!\" Even uber-techy Wilson is impressed with Jessica's mobile tech truck. \u2022 \"The numbers are boring, I like the art.\" Alice pieces the manuscript together. \u2022 \"I don't know if I want to go through all that with someone watching me ...\" Without the Deels drugs (curse you, Prof Pervert!), Becky hops on a train by herself, sparing Ian from seeing her fall apart. \u2022 Wilson Wilson really has drunk the Network's Kool-Aid hasn't he? \"We can't be the people that destroys humanity's chance at life.\" \"What if the enemy is right?\" Will he be back running the Network's networks next time? Nothing like a hacker to beef up security. \u2022 \"My name is Michael Dugdale \u2013 I'm with the department of health.\" It's not quite \"Bond, James Bond\", is it? \u2022 Fancy getting in touch with the Network? The email address Wilson had for The Assistant was LDS101@corvadtltd.com \u2013 might get an interesting out-of-office now. \u2022 Thanks to @NickieSault for tracking down Arby's favourite cafe \u2013 TC's in Preston, in case you're on the run and need to keep your strength up. \u2022 \"I'm having to make myself look like a UFO nutter just to get in.\" Yes Wilson, that's the only reason. \u2022 \"Stand down.\" Grant uses his best Mr Rabbit voice to save his mum. \u2022 \"We best pals now? You want to borrow my lipstick?\" What's this? Has Jessica developed a sense of humour? \u2022 \"All right then, shithead, let's give it a go\"; \"I'll miss you, twat.\" Ah, true love, Utopia style. Over to you then: do you want more from Milner? A Lee and Arby prequel? To follow Jessica on the run again? Has Utopia left you seeing the hand of the Network every time you turn on the news (horsemeat burgers, papal abdication, mystery viruses)? Did this last episode deliver and do you want more?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
