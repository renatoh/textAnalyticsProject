It's a boy thing", "bodyText": "A shocking report has revealed that thousands of teenagers are taking anabolic steroids 'to look better'. On the plus side, school sports day is now finished in half the time. A spokesman for drugs charity DrugScope, which conducted the survey, said: 'The rise in young men misusing steroids is extremely worrying and seems to be in response to a growing obsession with the ideal body image.' I think young men always fantasised about the ideal body image. Surely this was why they loved Billy Batson, who, with a simple cry of 'Shazam!', could transform himself from a geeky schoolboy into the rippling Captain Marvel. In the absence of a magic word and a comic universe, steroids may well strike your average kid as the closest thing to metamorphosis at superhero speed. But it does seem that men of all ages are being encouraged to feel even worse about their bodies. It is obvious whose interests are best served here. As Nirpal Dhaliwal perceptively wrote a few days ago in a piece about London Fashion Week, 'Women's infatuation with [Kate Moss] is an expression of their pathological and masochistic need to feel bad about themselves.' The latest advert for Selfridges dictates, in a peculiar inversion of my own world-view: 'Self-respect is whatever it takes to fit into that dress.' I would argue it's the opposite, but paranoia shifts a lot of frocks. The fashion and cosmetic industries must know that if they can only breed a similar self-hating madness in the other half of the species, profit margins will expand faster than a Wag's bra size after a lucrative season. (In passing, what happened to 'the end of Kate Moss's career'? In the September issue of Tatler, she appears in full-page adverts for Dior, Versace, Burberry and Louis Vuitton before we even get to the first article. That's what I call a working freelance.) Understandably, these industries are starting to needle away at male confidence. A L'Oreal advert for men's moisturiser whispers: 'What you think are great lines, she thinks are premature wrinkles.' She doesn't, obviously. Women aren't as trivial as that. When it comes to fancying men, we aren't obsessed with the meaningless superficiality of looks. We're simply interested in money. That was a joke. I wouldn't go so far as to agree with those who say nothing matters but personality (I wouldn't find myself in bed with Johnny Depp, pretending he was Woody Allen), but I know that your average lonely bloke would do a lot better to work on his conversational manner than his skincare regime. In fact, easy confidence is so attractive that a long period at the sink might actually work against him. But we know all this. We know what female attraction is really about. It is even possible that women will find the L'Oreal advert so ridiculous that they unleash a little voice in their own souls which says: 'Hang on a minute ... if I don't think about men in the way this advert says I do, then maybe ... maybe men don't think that way either? Maybe men don't really care if I'm half a stone overweight and go a little pale in winter? Maybe I don't need to spray-paint my body and inject it with silicone to get their attention?' Teenagers need to do all that nonsense even less than the rest of us. My brother remembers a time at school when, after the boys had been laughing especially loudly at the girls for being fat/speccy/ spotty/ugly in one way or another, they were interrupted by a French teacher who remarked, in utter bafflement, 'But they're all so beautiful!' And, of course my brother realises now, they must have been. They were 15-year-old girls. They were all so beautiful. Teenagers recognise each other's beauty when they're ready. Steroid-beefed muscles for the boys and (the last horror story I read) Brazilian waxes for the girls can't speed up that process. And I think teenagers must know this, because teenagers know everything. All they do is communicate with each other, and comb the internet for further information. Text this, surf that; they must know everything there is to know about attraction and what people want. So I suspect the craze for teen body-polishing has nothing to do with sex. I think it's to do with the technology itself. All these kids are filming themselves on mobile phones, talking into digicams, setting up MySpace.com pages and putting their movies on YouTube.com. (That and auditioning for The X Factor.) They are feeling the same pressure as movie stars. They must be constantly fit to appear on camera, always ready for their close-up. Male and female, they are gradually turning into those pinched, waxed, personal-trained Hollywood actresses who kindly explain in interviews: 'I work hard to look this good, because I have to. I'm under permanent scrutiny.' If that's your child's problem, my best advice is to buy him a lot of DVDs starring Ernest Borgnine, Walter Matthau and Charles Hawtrey, and tell him they were always the coolest people in showbusiness. Proof that you can prove anything with statistics Canadian university professor John Philippe Rushton has 'found', using his own special way of analysing data, that men are more intelligent than women. His special methods previously found that Europeans are cleverer than Africans. I might commission Professor Rushton to study the IQ difference between gay and straight people. Just for the exciting suspense, as we all wait to see what on earth the open-minded scientist will conclude next."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
