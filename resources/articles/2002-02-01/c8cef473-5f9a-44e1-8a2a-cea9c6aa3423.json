Stapleford is angry that Le Gougne has accused her publicly of putting pressure on her to say it was the French federation that forced her to vote for the Russian couple during the controversial pairs competition last week. \"The woman is obviously emotionally distressed,\" said Stapleford. \"No one likes having their integrity questioned but she changes her story daily, so I think most people now know what to make of it. \"She is living in a fantasy world. I know I didn't make these suggestions. I actually feel quite sorry for the lady. Her memory is playing tricks with her.\" Stapleford's version of events is supported by John Jackson, an ISU judge from San Francisco, who witnessed their confrontation in a hotel lobby after the competition a week ago last Monday. \"Marie-Reine came right up to Sally and said: 'Ice dancing is ruining the sport of figure skating,'\" said Jackson, a lawyer. \"Then she said, 'I have to defend myself. I did this for my dance team. It's a deal with the Russians, first place for first place.'\" The French couple Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat won the ice-dancing gold medal on Monday. The games has also had its first drugs controversy with Belarus's chef de mission Yaroslav Barichko being banned from the Olympics after one of his athletes failed to turn up for an out-of-competition doping test. The IOC believes Barichko helped the speedskater Yulia Pavlovich avoid the test by smuggling her out of the athletes' village. Rhona Martin and her rink were given a reprieve when Switzerland beat Germany to allow Britain to scrape into a play-off and keep alive their medal hopes. They took advantage of this unexpected good fortune when they beat the 1998 bronze medallists Sweden. That put them in the position of earning a semi-final spot if they beat Germany in a final eliminator. It was defeat against Germany in their final match of the round-robin tournament which seemed to have spelled the end for Britain. Defeat by Sweden earlier in the event had also been one of the reasons why Britain found themselves in this dilemma, but Martin and her team-mates Debbie Knox, Fiona MacDonald and Janice Rankin were in top form yesterday. Sweden were outclassed as Britain won 6-4. \"We were pretty dejected after yesterday's performance and thought we had blown it,\" said Martin, a 35-year-old from Irvine. \"This was a lifeline and we knew we had to play well.\" Curling has been the surprise hit of these games. About 42% of Olympic television coverage has been devoted to curling. That interest has been mirrored on the web where curling moved ahead of Anna Kournikova on Yahoo's index listing the most searched athletes and sports topics on the internet. \"We're giving more coverage to curling now,\" said Tom Feuer, the executive producer for NBC. \"It's been an eye-opener.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
