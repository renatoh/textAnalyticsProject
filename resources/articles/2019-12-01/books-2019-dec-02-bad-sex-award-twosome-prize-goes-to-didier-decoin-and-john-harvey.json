Established in 1993 by the Literary Review editor Auberon Waugh and critic Rhoda Koenig, the award is for \u201cthe year\u2019s most outstandingly awful scene of sexual description in an otherwise good novel\u201d. It is intended to draw attention to \u201cthe poorly written, redundant, or downright cringeworthy passages of sexual description in modern fiction\u201d. Decoin, a French author who received the Prix Goncourt in 1977 for his novel John l\u2019Enfer, won for passages in his novel The Office of Gardens and Ponds, a fable set in Japan 1,000 years ago. It includes descriptions such as: \u201cKatsuro moaned as a bulge formed beneath the material of his kimono, a bulge that Miyuki seized, kneaded, massaged, squashed and crushed. With the fondling, Katsuro\u2019s penis and testicles became one single mound that rolled around beneath the grip of her hand. Miyuki felt as though she was manipulating a small monkey that was curling up its paws.\u201d Harvey, the author of five novels and a life fellow at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, was nominated for his novel Pax, which featured this scene: \u201cShe was burning hot and the heat was in him. He looked down on her perfect black slenderness. Her eyes were ravenous. Like his own they were fire and desire. More than torrid, more than tropical: they two were riding the equator. They embraced as if with violent holding they could weld the two of them one.\u201d This is the first time either author has won the prize. In a statement announcing the result on Monday night, the judges said: \u201cFaced with two unpalatable contenders, we found ourselves unable to choose between them. We believe the British public will recognise our plight.\u201d In a clear callback to the controversial decision to award two Booker prizes this year, when chair of judges Peter Florence claimed, \u201cWe tried voting, that didn\u2019t work \u2026 We couldn\u2019t separate them\u201d, the Bad sex judges said they were unable to choose even \u201cafter hours of tortuous debate\u201d. \u201cWe tried voting, but it didn\u2019t work,\u201d they said. \u201cWe tried again. Ultimately, there was no separating the winners.\u201d Other titles up for this year\u2019s award included The River Capture by Mary Costello (\u201cShe begged him to go deeper and, no longer afraid of injuring her, he went deep in mind and body, among crowded organ cavities, past the contours of her lungs and liver, and, shimmying past her heart, he felt her perfection\u201d); City of Girls by Eat, Pray, Love author Elizabeth Gilbert (\u201cI screamed as though I were being run over by a train\u201d); and Dominic Smith\u2019s The Electric Hotel (\u201cFor most of the proceedings he felt his own desire as if it were tethered to a wire, a bright red balloon floating in his peripheral vision, but eventually he burst through.\u201d). The award, which is traditionally announced at a ceremony at the In &amp; Out (Naval &amp; Military) Club in London, has been dominated by male novelists over the years. Only three women have won in 26 years, with authors including Sebastian Faulks, John Updike and Giles Coren taking the dubious honour, and with varying reactions. While Coren turned up to the ceremony and said, \u201cI wish I\u2019d written them all\u201d, Tom Wolfe boycotted the prize when he triumphed in 2004 for a scene in I Am Charlotte Simmons that included the line \u201cslither slither slither slither went the tongue\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying: \u2018You can lead a whore to culture but you can\u2019t make her sing.\u2019 In this case, you can lead an English literary wannabe to irony but you can\u2019t make him get it,\u201d Wolfe said later. Last year\u2019s prize was won by James Frey for the novel Katerina, which included lines such as: \u201cOne. White. God. Cum. Cum. Cum. I close my eyes let out my breath. Cum.\u201d Frey took the prize in good humour, saying he was \u201cdeeply honoured and humbled to receive this prestigious award\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
