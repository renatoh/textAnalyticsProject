The former England manager, who has been out of work since leaving Crystal Palace in the summer, is due back from holiday on Wednesday and is expected to meet Everton\u2019s major shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, to finalise his contract, believed to be worth around \u00a36m a year. Initial talks with Allardyce\u2019s representatives broke down earlier this month but it is understood that Everton returned to the 63-year-old after it became clear Watford were not interested in allowing Marco Silva to leave Vicarage Road. The former Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare is also likely to be named as part of Allardyce\u2019s coaching staff, with Lee set to resume his partnership with the manager he has previously worked with at Bolton, England and Palace. They are expected to be in place in time for Saturday\u2019s Premier League match against Huddersfield, with David Unsworth taking charge of his final match as caretaker against West Ham on Wednesday night. Allardyce had previously pulled out of discussions to take over from Koeman, who was sacked following the 5-2 home defeat by Arsenal last month, citing the club\u2019s indecision as his reason. \u201cIt never materialised as I thought it would, unfortunately,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was such a long time without a decision, so I had to make a decision myself. I decided it was probably better it wasn\u2019t me and I\u2019d move on to something else. It would have been a fabulous job but it just didn\u2019t feel right. I think when you\u2019re in my position, you want people to be decisive and feel like they want you. I didn\u2019t get that feeling overall. They were hesitating that I was the man.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
