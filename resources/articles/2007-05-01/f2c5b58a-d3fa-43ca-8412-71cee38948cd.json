Mr Groenink, who will lose any day to day management role if an agreed take-over by Barclays goes ahead, was waiting for answers last night as he endured concerted pressure from investors to negotiate with the potential hostile bidders. He is expected to start receiving information today from the consortium - which includes Santander of Spain and Fortis of Belgium. The consortium will attempt to assure ABN Amro that the \u00a335bn of cash it needs will be raised through rights issues by Fortis and Santander and underwritten by US investment bank Merrill Lynch while RBS will issue up to \u00a312bn of its shares to shareholders in the Dutch bank. TCI, the London hedge fund which has led a shareholder rebellion against the Dutch bank's management, called for the board to \"immediately terminate\" Mr Groenink's employment. TCI also called on the bank's supervisory board, which has to approve strategic decisions, to take control of the sale process from the management board, which is led Mr Groenink. ABN Amro has run into trouble with its investors after recommending a \u00a345bn takeover by Barclays and a side deal to sell its US banking arm LaSalle to Bank of America for $21bn. Shareholders regard the LaSalle deal as a \"poison pill\" to deter the RBS consortium from bidding. In a letter to Arthur Martinez, chairman of the supervisory board, TCI said that Mr Groenink did \"not support the RBS consortium offer that we believe is a superior proposal to the Barclays offer\" and criticised his public opposition to a break-up of ABN Amro, as suggested by the RBS-led consortium. Pressure also mounted on ABN Amro after a class action suit was filed in New York demanding a halt to the sale of LaSalle. Filed by Halpert Enterprises, the suit describes the sale as \"wrongful, unfair and harmful to ABN's public stockholders and respresents an effort by defendants to aggrandise their own financial position and interest at the expense of and to the detriment of ABN's public stockholders\". ABN Amro dismissed the suit, saying it \"refutes it on multiple grounds and intends to seek a dismissal of it\". The Dutch bank has already faced a court case brought by domestic shareholder group VEB which is also trying to halt the sale of LaSalle. The outcome of that case is expected on Thursday and could lead to the consortium mounting an offer for ABN Amro the following day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
