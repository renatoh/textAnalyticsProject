Stephanie Curnow has not gone quite that far with James Heneage, who runs the Ottakar's chain, but she does describe him as \"gentlemanly\". Curnow set up The Word, a bookshop in Market Harborough, last December, before discovering that a branch of Ottakar's was to open in the town in June. Realising that she would be unlikely to survive the competition, she decided to close her shop; Ottakar's bought her stock, gave her financial support to enable her to exit her lease, and offered her a job. She is now assistant manager at Ottakar's, Milton Keynes. \u00b7 Faber has sold the last of its specialist lists, a wine series comprising erudite guides to countries and regions, to Mitchell Beazley. Faber is much better known as the publisher of Seamus Heaney and Kazuo Ishiguro than it is of non-fiction reference works; and Mitchell Beazley, which publishes Hugh Johnson and is the leading name in the field, will be a good home for the list. But it is a little sad that publishers, as they emphasise \"core\" activities, are ironing out the eccentricity that led them to take on books quite unrelated to their principal businesses. Faber also had a series of titles on pigeons; among them, Racing Pigeons, Keep Your Pigeons Flying and, for those less attached to the birds, Pigeon Shooting. The anomaly became obvious when Pentagram, the smart design firm, was responsible for Faber's jackets. One showed merely a tiny pigeon in a great deal of creatively deployed white space - a trendy concept that was probably inappropriate for the pigeon fanciers' market. \u00b7 A leading agent has advised writers to treat with caution a new web service offering reviews of works by unpublished writers. Simon Trewin, who works at the PFD agency and is secretary of the Association of Authors' Agents, said that he was uneasy about the approach of Golgonooza, which charges \u00a365 plus VAT for a review posted on its website and advertised in emails sent to agencies. Golgonooza is employing a team of booksellers to write the reviews. Trewin said that agents received quite enough unsolicited material and would be unlikely to welcome any more. It appears that Golgonooza needs to sell itself to agencies as well as to authors; if Mr Trewin and his colleagues were won over, the service would become worthwhile. \u00b7 Following the refit at Foyles, another venerable independent bookseller in London is to get a makeover. Stanfords, founded 150 years ago, will expand its travel bookshop in Long Acre, Covent Garden, from 5,500sq ft to 8,000sq ft. It is also spending \u00a3300,000 this autumn on a new, 3,500sq ft branch in Manchester, where it will unveil its new strapline, created as a result of a brand review: \"Explore Discover Inspire\". Anyone who has been involved in business reviews will be able to imagine the earnest summits from which these words emerged as most representative of Stanfords' character. \u00b7 Also due for a facelift is Blackwell's bookshop on Charing Cross Road, London. The shop was voted Chain Bookseller of the Year in 1998, but now looks a little staid by comparison with its neighbours, Foyles and Borders. Blackwell's has a new managing director, Dominic Myers, who has taken the bold step of announcing publicly that too much of the chain's offering - no doubt he was excluding the splendidly refitted store in Broad Street, Oxford - was \"tatty\". \"We're like a library,\" he added. One might point out that looking like a library made Waterstone's the most prestigious name in bookselling. But Blackwell's is unlikely to forget what it stands for. The firm's progress, Mr Myers said, would be \"more evolution than revolution\". \u00b7 Scott Ritter, the former UN weapons inspector and a leading opponent of plans to wage war on Iraq, is to be the subject of book to be rushed out next Friday (September 20). War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn't Want You To Know, will be an 80-page paperback from Profile Books, and will take the form of an interview between Ritter and journalist William Pitt Rivers. Since the demise of Penguin Specials, this kind of rapid, topical publishing has become rare - rival media do current affairs too well. But it can still work: earlier this year, Private Eye sold 30,000 copies of a pamphlet about the foot and mouth outbreak. \u00b7 Nicholas Clee is editor of the Bookseller.
