Bannan has been omitted from Levein's squad for next week's friendly in Cyprus. The Aston Villa midfielder has just served a club suspension after being arrested on suspicion of drink-driving. In recent times, Levein has not called on Garry O'Connor or David Goodwillie while separate criminal charges were hanging over the duo. O'Connor faces trial next year accused of possessing cocaine, a charge he denies, while Goodwillie faced a rape charge which was subsequently dropped. \"I have made decisions on these cases but, in future, it might be taken away from the manager if there are rules in black and white to be followed,\" the Scotland manager said. \"It is part of our performance strategy that there will be a code of conduct. The sooner we get it in at the younger age groups and continue it through all of the groups, then I think it is something we should be proud of.\" Levein said the wider implications of playing for Scotland are behind his stance. \"It would be fantastic for me if we could see ourselves as role models, as people who want to behave in a manner which is representative of national team players,\" he added. \"I'm just trying to stress that there is a responsibility for players who are included in the national team to act in a responsible manner. When we have established that everyone knows what their responsibilities are, it becomes much easier to perpetuate it. I am trying to be pretty consistent now on what the message is.\" That sentiment has, however, denied Levein the services of players. \"Yes, it probably has, but what do you do? Do you sanction going down a different road?\" he asked. \"At a club, a manager has to deal with his board of directors and his supporters. That's quite a small group. With the national team, there are so many different interests in Scotland who would have objections to different things the players are getting up to. They feel 'how could someone play for Scotland if this and that is happening?' \"So there is more of a moral responsibility with the national team. I might be wrong about that, but I feel there is. I think there is more of a moral onus on me to try and put people in the team who are behaving in a manner that befits playing for the national side. \"If I take a player away with me who is the subject of a lot of speculation, I also spend a lot of my time answering questions on stuff that is nothing to do with the game. It detracts from the match and takes the focus away. I don't want to be sitting in Cyprus answering these questions and putting players up who have issues back home. This allows me to concentrate on the football.\" Levein confirmed that Huddersfield Town's Jordan Rhodes will feature in at least part of the Cyprus game on 11 November. The young striker has been fast-tracked into the senior squad amid excellent form at club level. Scotland squad for the friendly against Cyprus on 11 November Gilks (Blackpool), Marshall (Cardiff), McGregor (Rangers); Bardsley (Sunderland), Berra (Wolves), Caldwell (Wigan), Hanley (Blackburn), Hutton (Aston Villa), Martin (Norwich), Wallace (Rangers), Whittaker (Rangers); Adam (Liverpool), Cowie (Cardiff), Dorrans (West Brom), Fletcher (Manchester United), McArthur (Wigan), Morrison (West Brom), Robson (Middlesbrough), Snodgrass (Leeds); Goodwillie (Blackburn), Mackail-Smith (Brighton), Mackie (QPR), Miller (Cardiff), Rhodes (Huddersfield)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
