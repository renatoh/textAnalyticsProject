Hours before Barack Obama's statement announcing a political and military surge, Miliband said he hoped President Hamid Karzai would deliver on his commitment to ensure that Afghan troops take the lead in all 34 provinces within five years. Britain hopes that the surge, which will see a further 500 British troops deployed to Afghanistan this month, will pave the way for a withdrawal to begin within a year. But Miliband indicated this would be a slow process. \"We very much hope, in line with President Karzai's commitment, that within five years all provinces in the country will follow Kabul in having the Afghan security leadership. However that does not mean the end of international support for the Afghan forces \u2026 and the so-called overwatch role that has developed for the circumstances of Iraq will remain an issue beyond that,\" he said. Obama outlined his plans for a political and military surge in Afghanistan to Brown in a 45-minute video conference call yesterday evening. Miliband told the Today programme on Radio 4: \"At the heart of the plan for the future of Afghanistan is a very important insight that there can be no victory unless the military strategy is combined with a political strategy, both on the Afghan side and the Pakistani side of the border. It is very important that we have the economic development that gives people something that creates a future for them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
