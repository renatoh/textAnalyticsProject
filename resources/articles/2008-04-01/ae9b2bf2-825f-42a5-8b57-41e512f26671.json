This set returns to that album's predecessor, All Is Now, and the acoustic quartet that the saxophonist developed to play his acclaimed Monk-celebrating repertoire. But this time, all the pieces are originals by the band members. Kofi's fascination with the pre-free music of John Coltrane, and the catchy, gospel-flavoured hard-bop manner of Herbie Hancock's Watermelon Man or Lee Morgan's The Sidewinder, is reflected in his own themes here. The urgently uptempo If I Spoke My Mind suggests a twist on Coltrane's Impressions but with a Latin countermelody, and the title track is an infectious, steadily emphatic hook for the leader's slithery soprano-sax phrasing over Jonathan Gee's funky piano vamp. The quirkier and least generic themes come from Gee and bassist Ben Hazleton. But if Kofi's written contributions have a golden-age familiarity, his improvising has an arrestingly raw power, and the slow quiver of his ballad-playing on the hauntingly film noir-like First Breath would have graced any classic straightahead session by the legends. Gee's canny timing and Monkish chord-structures almost steal the plaudits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
