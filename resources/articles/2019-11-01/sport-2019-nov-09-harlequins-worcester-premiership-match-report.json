Relentless boshing, relentless rain, but at least the twist of a surprise victory at the death. Worcester have a troubling habit of putting themselves in winning positions only to blow it at the end, as last weekend at home to Exeter. This time, they dominated throughout, bode their time and struck a quarter of an hour from the end to claim a precious away win. Jamie Shillcock was worked over to atone for an earlier error, when Quins claimed an early lead with two tries. The hosts would not register a point beyond the 13th minute. \u201cTo come here in this kind of weather, to go 14-3 down so early and come back to win was exceptional,\u201d said Alan Solomons, Worcester\u2019s director of rugby. In these salary-sensitive times, the depth of both squads was tested, as was their composure in the rain. Suffice it to say, both clubs looked well within budget. Neither is riding higher than mid-table but it was Worcester who hogged the majority of possession, forcing Quins into nearly twice the number of tackles. The trouble with possession on a day like this, though, is that if you keep the ball long enough you will spill it eventually. The Warriors might have won this earlier otherwise. An early penalty by Jono Lance, a replacement for Duncan Weir and installed as captain to boot, set them off, but Quins swooped for two quick tries either side of the 10-minute mark. A lovely inside ball by their captain for the day, James Chisholm, set Alex Dombrandt free to the line after a couple of hefty carries by Tevita Cavubati on his debut. Five minutes later, Francis Saili rattled Shillcock, who spilled the ball, and Chisholm hacked on adeptly to touch down for a second. At 14-3 with not even a quarter of an hour played, Quins seemed to resign themselves to defensive duties. Worcester dominated. Melani Nanai, their new bruiser on the wing, flexed his muscles and countless others flooded in behind him. But the weather and a rugged defensive effort restricted them to just two more Lance penalties for a 14-9 deficit at the break. Not much changed thereafter, bar a thickening of the curtain of rain. Water began to stand on the pitch, as Worcester continued to hammer away and spill, hammer away and spill. Salvation was forthcoming at last with a quarter of an hour to go. On came Joe Taufete\u2019e, nominated for world player of the year recently, who carried with feeling, and from the next phase the excellent Michael Heaney sent Shillcock arcing to the line through a couple of defenders. It was the very least of their deserts. Quins took a turn then at hammering away, only to encounter the same problem \u2013 the wetness of a rugby ball. So the match ended as it had been conducted for more or less its entirety. Worcester hammered; Quins crept offside; and time was up. Rather than hoof the ball into touch, Lance lined up one last kick at goal, which he converted. The right team had won."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
