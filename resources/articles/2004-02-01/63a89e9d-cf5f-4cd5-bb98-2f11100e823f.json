Media excitement over the return of the show that critic Mark Lawson described as \"a series of brilliant and knowing parodies of the cliches of the crassest TV fiction\" is already reaching fever pitch, and is likely to intensify after tonight's first episode - which will feature sex, extortion, ladyboys, and more sex. For Price, who is more used to treading the boards in classical dramas (his last job before filming Footballers' Wives was as Achilles in a well-received Iphigenia at the Sheffield Crucible), the attention is somewhat dismaying. \"It seems a bit strange that the show hasn't even started yet and my arse has been splashed all over the newspapers,\" he told Guardian Unlimited a few hours before the feature-length opening episode of the third series is aired. Indeed, if you have flicked through the tabloids in the last few days, you will have seen the 32-year-old actor in any number of \"raunchy\" shots from the set. In the Sunday Mirror, for instance, he was pictured doing naughty things to \"superbitch Tanya Turner\" (Zoe Lucker) and today he appears alongside his on-screen wife Amber (Laila Rouass) on page three of the Sun. How has his long-term girlfriend been coping with the pictures of him in such compromising positions? \"It is not the nicest thing to have to look at, but she is very at ease about the whole thing. She works in the media and I was up front from the beginning about the kind of scenes I would be shooting, so she would be prepared for all this.\" While competing for column inches with the real-life Beckhams of this world, however, he has managed to avoid falling victim to the more salacious headlines meted out to his co-stars (see Rouass' \"Secret Sexless Marriage\" in today's Mirror). This is due in part to his very cautious approach to the press and his desire to keep his private life separate from that of Conrad. (While he agreed to dozens of tabloid interviews to publicise the show, he turned down a potentially lucrative but invasive Hello feature). \"I have been amazed at how quickly you can rise to celebrity, but I am not someone who hankers after being in the paper everyday. It just doesn't interest me.\" It comes as no surprise to find, then, that he is relishing what will probably prove to be his last few days of relative obscurity while preparing for his next job at the Gate Theatre in Dublin: as the caddish Gerry Evans in the classic Brian Friel play Dancing at Lughnasa. \"My background is in theatre and it is nice to be going back on stage. The good thing about being in Ireland is that I have been distanced from everything that is going on with Footballers' Wives so I can just concentrate on the play,\" he says. Well, for now at least. \u00b7 Ben Price can be seen in Footballers' Wives tonight at 9pm on ITV1 and in Dancing at Lughnasa at the Gate Theatre from February 24."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
