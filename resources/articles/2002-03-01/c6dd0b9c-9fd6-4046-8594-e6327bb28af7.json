The meeting will be held on a date to be announced after Wales's final Six Nations match against Scotland next month, averting the possibility of a further strike threat by the national squad players. The clubs are almost certain to vote against change, leaving the leading clubs - the so-called gang of six: Cardiff, Swansea, Llanelli, Bridgend, Newport and Pontypridd - to consider their positions. \"My gut instinct is to walk away from the game,\" said the Bridgend owner Leighton Samuel, who saved the club from bankruptcy four years ago. \"We have been conned by the WRU who promised us change only to pass the buck to the whole membership, which means that amateurs will be voting on the future of the professional game. \"The WRU is ducking and diving when it should be showing leadership and we all know why: if it had kept its word and agreed the move to six, the general committee knew it risked facing a vote of no confidence from some of the junior clubs. My information is that one will be called anyway against the union's chairman Glanmor Griffiths. \"The union's self-preservation instinct is so sharp that it has removed the two bullets we had in our revolver - the players refusing to play against England on Saturday and Scotland next month -without having conceded anything. There is so much ill-feeling against the six clubs pressing for change that the vote is doomed to fail. But we have to turn the guns on the WRU and ask, with the Millennium Stadium losing so much money, how it can keep its promises to the smaller clubs let alone the professional ones. There has to be change at the top otherwise the game is doomed.\" Stuart Gallacher, Llanelli's chief executive, said: \"We are looking at the stark prospect of all the leading clubs in Wales losing their backers and becoming semi-professional with the top players moving to other countries. \"The clubs will be meeting later this week, but it looks grim. The promises which were made to prevent the players going on strike have turned to nothing and the consequences for the whole of Welsh rugby are serious. The junior clubs have to recognise that.\" \u00b7The Rugby Football Union's lawyers meet today to consider the takeover of Moseley by Firoz Kassam, the chairman of Oxford United who wants to buy the franchise and create a new club Oxford Eagles. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
