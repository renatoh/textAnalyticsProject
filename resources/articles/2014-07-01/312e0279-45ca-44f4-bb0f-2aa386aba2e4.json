Grim news today. MH17 World anger is growing at Russia for not forcing pro-Russian rebels to cooperate in allowing international experts to examine the scene of the MH17 air disaster, in which 298 people were killed when their passenger plane was shot out of the sky. 198 bodies have reportedly been moved from the crash site, to be stored in refrigerated railway carriages. Three pro-Russia rebel leaders are at the centre of suspicions over the downed plane, and US secretary of state John Kerry has laid out the evidence against pro-Russian separatists on US television. Tony Abbott has said Russia cannot \"wash its hands\" of the tragedy, adding: \"My fear is that Russia will say the right thing but that on the ground interference with the site, interference with investigators, interference with the dignified treatment of bodies will continue.\" It has been claimed that MH17 was guided off its course in the hope of avoiding thunderstorms, explaining why the plane was miles north of its previous flight paths through the area. At a special mass in Sydney, Bishop Peter Comensoli remembered Australian victims, calling the disaster \"the outcome of a trail of human evil\", while in Moscow ordinary Russians are expressing horror at the tragedy. Sky News has apologised after one of its presenters was shown rifling through hand luggage belonging to a passenger. There have been lots of developments over the weekend; our latest live blog covering Abbott's comments to UK prime minister David Cameron overnight is here, and full MH17 coverage is here. Gaza Israel has killed scores of people in Shujai'iya, a suburb of Gaza City, in a deadly assault that has left bodies littering the streets. At least 87 Palestinians were killed yesterday in the bloodiest day of the recent conflict, overwhelming hospitals. A Palestinian human rights group has accused Israel of using flechette shells, which spray out thousands of tiny and potentially lethal metal darts. Groups of Israelis have gathered on hilltops close to the Gaza border to watch and cheer as bombs fall, and an Israeli soldier has posted what appears to be a photograph showing a Palestinian child in the crosshairs of a sniper rifle to Instagram. International efforts to secure a ceasefire are focusing on Qatar, whose close links to Hamas could help it to mediate the conflict. Our Gaza correspondent Peter Beaumont writes about his experience of the conflict, and especially of its impact on the children of Gaza: \"A few minutes later I come across the dead children's sister, a girl aged about seven with a long dark ponytail, cheeks glistening with tears. She is sitting on a bank of chairs with her mother, Muna, who is comforting a younger sibling. She looks to her mother, lost in her own grief, to the journalists and staff watching, and back to her mother looking for an explanation, a reassurance no one can give.\" Australian politics and news \u2022 Labor has won a Queensland byelection in Stafford, Brisbane, with a huge 18.6% swing away from the Coalition. \u2022 A long-awaited review into the National Disability Insurance Scheme has found a \"lack of clarity\" around the design which could slow the rollout; disability advocates dispute the findings. \u2022 An HIV-specific law in Victoria criminalising deliberate transmission will be amended to avoid discrimination. \u2022 Salman Rushdie and Helen Garner will headline Melbourne writers' festival. \u2022 Port Adelaide held off the Melbourne Demons in the AFL, and in the NRL the Wests Tigers stunned the Canterbury Bulldogs.
