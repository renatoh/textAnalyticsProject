Don\u2019t count chickens before your race is run", "bodyText": "It would seem that premature celebration is a big problem. Last week\u2019s victim was Slovenian cyclist Luka Pibernik who thought he\u2019d won stage five of the Giro d\u2019Italia. Passing the finishing line, Pibernik held his arms aloft, in triumphant \u201cwoo hoo!\u201d fashion, not realising (his radio was broken) that there was a whole lap to go. He was swiftly overtaken by a scrum of cyclists who weren\u2019t handicapped by having their arms in the air. In the end, the Colombian cyclist Fernando Gaviria won and Pibernik came\u2026 Second? Third? Nope. Pibernik came 148th. I suppose this could be viewed as the cycling version of that Oscar gaffe where they read the wrong best film out. Please let this be a lesson to everybody that premature celebration can strike at anytime. It\u2019s absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about, unless it was filmed and the footage was shown all the over the world. Only the blackest of hearts wouldn\u2019t feel sympathy for Pibernik. Perhaps he could take comfort in the phrase: \u201cIt\u2019s better to have celebrated and lost than never to have celebrated at all.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
