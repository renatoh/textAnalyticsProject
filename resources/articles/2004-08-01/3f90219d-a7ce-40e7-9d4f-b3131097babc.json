The biggest surprise was that Mr Barroso gave charge of competition and the internal market to the Netherlands and Ireland respectively. Both are areas in which the French and Germans have repeatedly clashed with the outgoing commission in pursuit of their own narrow national interests. This was Mr Barroso's boldest demonstration of the independence so vital to his role, and as such is reassuring. If his first act sets the tone for the rest of his presidency, he will be a difficult president to push around and will safeguard his own position's essential neutrality. Anyone who truly has the interests of Europe at heart will warmly welcome this.\" Wall Street Journal Europe Editorial, August 13 \"When [Mr Barroso on Thursday] announced the composition of his commission, it marked the end of an era. Since the EU's birth almost 50 years ago, the Franco-German axis has been driving its agenda - with the French clearly in the driver's seat. But as Mr Barroso read the names of the commissioners he had chosen for the key portfolios, it became clear that the centre of gravity has shifted: the Franco-German axis might still exist but it is not calling the shots. Almost none of the duo's central demands had been met while all important economic positions went to avowed free-marketers ... It is hard to imagine a greater setback for Franco-German ambitions in Europe than Mr Barroso's nomination.\" Gilles Bridier La Tribune, France, August 13 \"In the Barroso commission, the Franco-German axis ... will play a secondary role. Is this the revenge of the 'little countries' against the economic powerhouses of Europe? ... Of course, we must not judge the commissioners and analyse their posts on the basis of their nationalities since, once they are in Brussels, they will be expected to renounce their national allegiances. But by showing themselves to be inflexible over the presence of representatives of each one of them at the heart of the commission, the new members of the union have seriously undermined this dogma. As such, the Barroso commission will mark a turning point in the history of Europe. What new role will the old Franco-German motor play there, diluted and dismissed in a wider EU?\" Martin Halusa Die Welt, Germany, August 13 \"Mr Barroso has sent out a clear signal: economic and industrial policy has again been given top importance ... [He] has put the economic recovery of Europe at the top of his list of priorities ... In order to lend more weight to his ambitious plan, he has given the industry commissioner G\u00fcnther Verheugen the office of vice-president. The Germans therefore are awarded the central position that [Chancellor] Gerhard Schr\u00f6der wanted. Mr Barroso was the third-rate choice in the election for commission president. But it seems he has already cast off this stigma.\" El Mundo Editorial, Spain, August 13 \"The birth of the new European commission does not hold any surprises. Mr Barroso inherited the script and handed the most relevant portfolios to the most powerful countries ... But this fair division of power is nothing more than an illusion. States such as Malta or Slovenia are relegated to having commissioners with virtually no weight while the big countries monopolise those which will be involved in important decisions. The obvious case is Germany, whose representative, Mr Verheugen, wins one of the vice-presidencies ... Spain came out of it better than expected ... Mr Barroso and his team face the challenge of ... raising the esteem of a body discredited by corruption and bureaucracy among its citizens.\" Daily Telegraph Editorial, August 13 \"Mr Barroso himself is a compromise choice as president-designate, but his Atlanticist outlook, and the fact that France and Germany were unable to force their preference for Guy Verhofstadt [the Belgian prime minister] on the rest of the union, makes him a much better candidate than that would imply. His abilities and the generally reformist views of the new EU members could yet restore the reputation of a deeply discredited body.\" Times Editorial, August 13 \"[Mr Barroso] has sent out the admirable message that serious economic reform will be ... his greatest priority. His appointments should at least allow him some hope of pursuing that agenda. Allowing Peter Mandelson to take charge of trade is a positive move, he is well qualified for the job ... Mr Mandelson has an especially enticing role ahead of him. With the Doha round of international trade talks having been revived by the conclusion of a tentative pact on agriculture ... two weeks ago, he has the opening to fashion a comprehensive agreement. His strong commitment to this cause and undoubted intelligence should prove assets in that enterprise. If successful, he will have far more impact on many more people (particularly the world's poor) in more places than he could have achieved as a minister in Britain.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
