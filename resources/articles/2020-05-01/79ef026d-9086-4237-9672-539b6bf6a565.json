The news was first broken by Jamie Lee Curtis, the wife of Christopher Guest, in whose mockumentaries \u2013 including Best in Show and A Mighty Wind \u2013 Willard won a new army of fans. \u201cHow lucky that we all got to enjoy Fred Willard\u2019s gifts,\u201d Curtis tweeted. \u201cHe is with his missed Mary now. Thanks for the deep belly laughs Mr. Willard.\u201d Willard\u2019s wife of 40 years, Mary, died in 2018. The death was confirmed by Willard\u2019s representative, Glenn Schwartz, who added that it was from natural causes. Said Willard\u2019s daughter, Hope Mulbarger, in a statement: \u201cMy father passed away very peacefully last night at the fantastic age of 86 years old. He kept moving, working and making us happy until the very end. We loved him so very much! We will miss him forever.\u201d Willard, who was born in 1933, made his big-screen debut in a little-seen 1967 film Teenage Mother, but his career remained in abeyance for a decade until Mary Hartman spinoff Fernwood 2 Night in 1977; he made his first appearance on Saturday Night Live the following year. In 1984, he began his collaboration with Guest when they shared the screen in Rob Reiner\u2019s seminal mockumentary This is Spinal Tap. Willard\u2019s Air Force lieutenant gives the Spinal Tap, including Guest\u2019s Nigel Tufnel, a tour of the military base. Guest went on to cast Willard in five more films he directed in the same vein: Waiting for Guffman (1996), Best in Show (2000), A Mighty Wind (2003), For Your Consideration (2006) and 2016\u2019s Mascots. Best in Show, about a dog pageant, became the actor\u2019s most celebrated role: he played an ill-briefed and often highly inappropriate TV commentator for the titular dog pageant. His character\u2019s tin-eared attempts at humour led to some of the film\u2019s funniest moments. Steve Carell, who starred alongside Willard in both Anchorman films \u2013 in which he played the clueless and overwhelmed news station boss, remembered Willard as \u201cthe funniest person that I\u2019ve ever worked with. He was a sweet, wonderful man.\u201d Anchorman co-star Christina Applegate tweeted that she was \u201cgutted\u201d over the news. \u201cHis immense talent and kindness will never be forgotten. We love you Fred Willard. Thank you for the decades of laughter.\u201d Willard also worked extensively in US sitcoms, in particularly Everybody Loves Raymond and Modern Family. He was Emmy-nominated for both roles. His films also included Fun With Dick and Jane (1977), Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999), Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle (2004), Epic Movie (2007), Max Rose (2013) and Fifty Shades of Black (2016). He was a fixture on late-night chat shows, with numerous appearances on the sofas of Jay Leno, David Letterman and Jimmy Kimmel. Kimmel tweeted his memories of the actor on Saturday, saying no man was \u201csweeter or funnier\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
