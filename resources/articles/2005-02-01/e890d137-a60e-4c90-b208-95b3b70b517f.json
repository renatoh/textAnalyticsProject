Gatland - who has led the club to consecutive Zurich Premiership titles, the Heineken Cup and Parker Pen Challenge Cup in two seasons of unprecedented success - has asked to be released from the final year of his contract. The club's board are likely to accept Gatland's request at a meeting on February 22. \"I've had a fantastic time at London Wasps, but there comes a time when one has to choose between job and family - and for once I've decided to put my family first,\" said Gatland. \"We still have plenty of work to do this season as we hope to secure a third Premiership title, and that's my main priority at the moment.\" Should Gatland's request be accepted by the board, as is expected later this month, Wasps will have to decide whether to appoint a replacement from within - former Great Britain rugby league player Shaun Edwards the likely candidate - or scour the rugby world for a more experienced candidate. Whoever gets the job will have large shoes to fill as the Gatland years have been the most successful period in Wasps' 138-year history. The former All Black guided Wasps off the bottom of the table and then in 2002-03 to the Premiership title and the Parker Pen Challenge Cup. Last season, Wasps sealed the double as they retained the Premiership title and won the Heineken Cup. However, Wasps have struggled to match last year's glories. The champions failed to advance from the pool stages of the Heineken Cup and were then thrown out of the Powergen Cup for fielding an ineligible player. \"We've taken some criticism lately with regards to having been a great team, but not being a great club,\" Gatland said. \"Only four teams have ever won the Premiership, and one of them is us. I'm proud to have been associated with a great club.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
