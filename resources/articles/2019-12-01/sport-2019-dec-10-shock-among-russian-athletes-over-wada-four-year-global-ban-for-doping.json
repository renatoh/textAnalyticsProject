Even during practice, Romashina said, she and a teammate on Russia\u2019s synchronised swimming national team spent Monday refreshing news feeds as they waited for the bombshell they knew was coming. Her first reaction was \u201cshock\u201d. \u201cWe were hoping for the best, but we expected the worst,\u201d Romashina said in an interview, calling the decision a \u201cblow to the reputation of clean athletes\u201d. \u201cI believe the punishment of clean athletes to be unacceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have not done anything wrong. We want to prove this and compete \u2026 but of course we can\u2019t argue with Wada. Clearly there was a basis [for the punishment], but there\u2019s still a question about the possibility for clean athletes to compete in the Games. We very much hope for that.\u201d After a five-minute break to digest the news, she said, \u201cwe got back to work\u201d. The ban is the latest consequence of a pervasive doping programme in Russian sport and ensuing attempts to hide it from the World Anti-Doping Agency. The revelations have cast a long shadow over Russia\u2019s Olympic programme and elicited some of the harshest sanctions in the history of international sport. Many Russian athletes say they have felt caught in the middle, calling the ban on the Russian team too harsh while also reserving strong words for a lack of effort from Russia\u2019s sporting establishment. \u201cI\u2019m not a sporting official but, from where I stand, obviously they could have done more and done it better,\u201d Romashina said. As Tokyo 2020 approaches, Romashina is one of hundreds of Russian athletes who can, at best, only realise their Olympic dream under a neutral banner rather than the flag of her country. But that decision will also require deep introspection, she said, pitting national feeling against camaraderie with her teammates. \u201cOn the one hand as an Olympic champion for Russia, I could say I won\u2019t go, that I\u2019ll be a patriot to the end and not compete under a neutral flag,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t compete alone. I compete as a pair, as part of a team, and I don\u2019t have the right to let down my teammates. It\u2019s not right to them. And why should I refuse to compete under a neutral flag, when I and my teammates have done nothing wrong?\u201d Already, that question has evoked stark responses from athletes and politicians. Mariya Lesitskene, a high-jumper who has been outspoken on doping issues, blasted Russian sporting officials for leaving athletes \u201calone in their fight\u201d and has vowed to compete. Meanwhile, a senior official in the Russian parliament has called on athletes not to participate, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to go [to Tokyo]; we should organise our own competitions.\u201d Russia has won gold in every Olympic synchronised swimming competition since 2000, and was considered a favourite to continue that run at Tokyo 2020. Romashina, who competes in both the duet and team routines, has stormed back into competition this year after taking a three-year hiatus from swimming to have a child, winning gold medals at the world championships in Gwangju, South Korea, in July. \u201cIf we don\u2019t go at all, and that is possible, then I will be far more hurt for the young athletes who would have been competing for the first time,\u201d said Romashina. \u201cI\u2019ve been at the Olympic Games. I\u2019ve seen it all and I have won. But for those who can\u2019t go, it will be a particular blow to them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
