The product recall affects nine models of \"umbrella\" strollers which fold up for easier storage. Maclaren USA received 15 reports of children placing their finger in the hinge, resulting in 12 reports of amputations. Many of the same models are available in the UK but a spokeswoman for Maclaren said last night that talks with British trading standards authorities have not resulted in a recall in this country. The affected models are manufactured in China and are distributed worldwide. They include the Volo, Triumph, Quest Sport, Quest Mod, Techno XT, TechnoXLR, Twin Triumph, Twin Techno and Easy Traveller and sell for up to \u00a3245 each. The recall covers pushchairs manufactured between 1999 and 2009. \"Maclaren consulted with Trading Standards in the UK and, as our products conform to European safety standards (EN1888), it was agreed no action was deemed necessary\" said a spokeswoman. She confirmed that the same models with the same mechanisms to those being recalled in the USA are also sold in the UK, but stressed they conform to different trading standards in Europe and the USA. She was not able to confirm whether the hinges of the UK models were any different to their American counterparts. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a statement today \"the stroller's hinge mechanism poses a fingertip amputation and laceration hazard to the child when the consumer is unfolding/opening the stroller\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
