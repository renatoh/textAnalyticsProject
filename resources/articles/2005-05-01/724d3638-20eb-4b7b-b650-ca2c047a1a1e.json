The two island states and Latvia, which all joined the EU on May 1 last year, agreed to tough structural and economic reforms over the next two years as they joined the exchange rate mechanism - a prelude to full euro entry later this decade. Ten new countries, including eight from eastern Europe, joined the EU a year ago and are expected to swell the eurozone to at least 22 members by 2010 if they meet the entry criteria. These include a budget deficit of less than 3%, a debt-to-GDP ratio of 60% and inflation and interest rates close to those of the best performing economies in the eurozone. They must also keep their currencies within a plus or minus 15% band around a central parity rate against the euro. Malta, which set its lira at a central rate of 0.429300 to the euro, promised to maintain this rate, while Latvia, which set its lats at 0.702804, said it would allow its currency to fluctuate by only plus or minus 1%. Cyprus, which set its pound at 0.585274, said it would observe the 15% plus or minus fluctuation. All three said they would toughen their fiscal stance, cutting debt, containing wage growth and public spending, and would reduce inflation, which in Latvia's case is more than 6% against the eurozone's 2.1%. Cypriot central bank governor Christodoulos Christodoulou told Reuters the authorities would raise the retirement age to improve the public finances while Malta said it could raise taxes and step up its privatisation programme. Latvia said it would act to cut its trade deficit and restrain domestic demand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
