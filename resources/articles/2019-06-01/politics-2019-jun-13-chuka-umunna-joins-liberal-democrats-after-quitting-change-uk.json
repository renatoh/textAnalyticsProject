Explaining his decision to join his third party in five months, the Streatham MP admitted he \u201cmassively underestimated just how difficult\u201d it was to set up a new party. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that there isn\u2019t room for more than one centre-ground option, particularly under the first past the post in UK politics,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He also admitted he was hesitant about joining the Lib Dems because of their role in the austerity programme under the coalition government. He said: \u201cThe thing that has given me pause for thought definitely has been the time that the Liberal Democrats served in coalition and the austerity. But things have changed since then, the Liberal Democrats have voted against every single Conservative budget since 2015.\u201d He added: \u201cI thought that the millions of politically homeless people in the radical centre ground of British politics \u2026 wanted a new party. And I was wrong about that. What people actually wanted us to do is to work together in the centre ground.\u201d He denied he was opportunistic in joining the Lib Dems after the failure of Change UK and predicted other MPs could also defect. \u201cI could see certainly a number of MPs, both in the Conservative and the Labour parties who are prepared to do that,\u201d he said. Asked how many, he replied: \u201cI\u2019d say a good handful.\u201d Change UK, initially called The Independent Group, had hoped to reshape the centre ground of British politics and provide a home for MPs disillusioned with both of the main parties. But it split acrimoniously after polling 3% at the European elections. Just days before the election, its interim leader Heidi Allen, the former Conservative MP, threatened to resign after a disagreement over whether the new party should urge its supporters to vote Lib Dem. Umunna had since been courted by Sir Vince Cable\u2019s resurgent party, which has successfully positioned itself as the leading anti-Brexit party. He told the Times he was prepared for criticism of his second change of party in four months. \u201cI\u2019ve got a pretty thick skin,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t leave all of the political security of what are the two main parties if you\u2019re out for self-advancement. And I\u2019m not sure what more I could do to prove that I\u2019m not, not a careerist.\u201d He said he had believed there were \u201cmillions of politically homeless people that wanted a new option on the ballot paper \u2013 I was wrong on that\u201d. Cable said he had \u201cdeveloped a relationship \u2013 I would say friendship \u2013 over quite a long period of time,\u201d with Umunna, who previously said he \u201cnever felt totally comfortable in the Labour party\u201d. Change UK consists of five MPs, led by the former Conservative Anna Soubry \u2013 and announced on Thursday it had been forced to change its name again, after a legal challenge from the petitions website Change.org. It will now be called the Independent Group for Change. It is unclear whether Umunna hopes to fight for his Streatham seat at the next election, or has been offered an alternative. He told the Times: \u201cI\u2019m a Streatham boy, born and bred, and I\u2019m absolutely committed to the constituency,\u201d but added that where he stands at the next election is a \u201cdiscussion that needs to be had\u201d. One Lib Dem source suggested he could stand in Richmond Park, the seat held by the Tories\u2019 Zac Goldsmith but which was won by Cable\u2019s former chief of staff Sarah Olney at a byelection in 2016. Cable\u2019s Twickenham seat could also become vacant if the 76-year-old decided to step down at a future general election. The former business secretary has announced he will resign from his party\u2019s leadership in the summer, once a contest has taken place. The two contenders to replace him are Ed Davey and Jo Swinson. Swinson said: \u201cI have worked with Chuka on the People\u2019s Vote campaign, and I know the passion, intellect and energy he will bring to our party, and our campaign to stop Brexit.\u201d Davey said he would make \u201ca huge contribution\u201d. Umunna\u2019s defection raised eyebrows among some of his Change UK colleagues, who claimed he was the author of a leaked party strategy document urging an adversarial approach to the Lib Dems."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
