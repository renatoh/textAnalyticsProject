Indeed, Adam Crozier, Royal Mail's chief executive, has been quoted as saying, \"other companies in the business are 40% more efficient\". But, as these other companies do not actually carry out final delivery - the difficult part - how can this statement be proved? If the Royal Mail is to be expected to operate commercially, treat its employees fairly and make a profit, it should be allowed to compete on a level playing field and not be hamstrung by politically motivated price-fixing. The competition's access charge to final delivery is clearly too low and, if it is true that Royal Mail is losing money on traditional mail, postal charges are too low as well. Alexander Goodwin Postman, Newcastle upon Tyne The CWU advertisement (October 9) suggests that Sunday collections are at threat. Well, we have just seen little notices stuck on our pillar boxes in this area informing us that these will in fact cease as from Sunday October 28. Not much consultation there by Royal Mail with customers. Barry Parker Leeds Spare a thought for the bereaved.
