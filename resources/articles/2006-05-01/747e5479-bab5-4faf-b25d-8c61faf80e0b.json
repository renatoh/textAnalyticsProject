Is it Heather, a suspected Klondyker among bridal gold-diggers, or her put-upon husband? That loaded question has been refocused by Paul, who cites media scrutiny, quite forgetting that the McCartneys are collusive in this game. No noble gesture, however trivial, ever goes unpublicised in Maccaland. Here, for example, is a recent item from Paul's website, featuring a picture of the clog and pixie boots that are going to help rid the world of landmines. 'Paul and Heather,' the caption notes, 'have both recently kindly donated a pair of shoes each to a celebrity shoe auction.' And here, on Lady Macca's site, is a note on the fate of the Cruellas who spurn her crusade against dog and cat fur in fashion. These people 'will reap their rewards for their actions in this and future lives,' she warns with grim omniscience. Together, the McCartneys have been pictured everywhere in Arctic survival gear, united in their war on seal-culling but clearly rivals on a par with Scott and Amundsen when it comes to harmonious relationships. Heather has been painted as an ambitious arriviste who ensnared a hero and forced him to give up spliffs and dye his hair a funny shade of marmalade. The intrusive media ensured, however, that McCartney cannot have thought he was marrying Miss Moneypenny. So what? Some people wish the obsequies for yet another defunct celebrity marriage were left to the Maccologists of Hello! magazine. But the story reveals much more about the British mood than it does about the anatagonists. As ever in such scripts, Heather is cast as the wicked pretender. Think Victoria Beckham, or Camilla Parker Bowles in the days when people were still throwing bread rolls at her in Gloucestershire supermarkets. The role of Heather's critics, though, is more sinister. In an age when famous strangers seem as intimate as family and friends, people mistake prurience for kinship. She sounds a curious woman with a variable grasp on fact. McCartney may have demonstrated the prescience of a lentil in choosing a second wife, but that does not merit odium from commentators who sound more like disapproving mothers-in-law than people whose sole bond with him might be a copy of Abbey Road on vinyl. Celebrity does odd things to society. Anyone doubting its power should wonder why Prince Charles, a man who makes Macca look cooler than King Creosote, has just given a keynote interview to Ant and Dec. Norman Mailer argued long ago that Americans led two lives, one predicated on the dull drone of politics and the other on 'untapped, ferocious, lonely and romantic desires'. He called this sub-current, equally applicable to Britain, 'the dream life of the nation'. A culture of illusion demands icons, but these are hard to find in an age bereft of Homeric or Arthurian figures. The New Statesman's quest for heroes last week produced a mostly lacklustre top 50, featuring George Galloway, Margaret Thatcher and the Queen. The dreariness of this pantheon partly explains why Britons are so fascinated by celebrity. The social consequences of the relationship between the famous and the unfamous are often potent and occasionally deadly. John Lennon's murderer, Mark David Chapman, was said to have influenced a fellow Beatles fan, John Hinckley, who went on to try and assassinate Ronald Reagan. McCartney's influence, though never part of the pathology of fame, was more powerful than people remember. Think back to Linda McCartney. She seemed a nice woman, if imperious. I had lunch with her once in a Chinese restaurant, and she announced that 'we' were eating vegetarian in tones calculated to turn any neighbouring carnivore with a chopstick poised above a battered prawn into an evangelist for bean sprouts. Her death, at 56, from breast cancer provoked scenes rivalling the mourning for Diana. Remember the angels' wings over Trafalgar Square, as thousands lit candles and held placards reading 'Viva! Saint Linda'. Even those failing to worship at the shrine of Our Lady of the Veggieburger could not deny something of vague cultural significance was going on. So you would expect a McCartney divorce to have a broader message, too. And by a quirk of legal timing, it does. On Wednesday, the Law Lords will rule on whether Melissa Miller should be able to keep the \u00a35m awarded to her following the breakdown of her short and childless marriage to Alan, a fund manager worth \u00a330m. Commentators have seized on parallels with the McCartneys. If Mrs Miller wins, the way is open for Heather to acquire around \u00a3200m of her husband's \u00a3830m fortune. The money has sparked a debate not only on the alleged cupidity of Lady Macca, which she denies, but on the grasping nature of rich wives in general. Affluent men may, some lawyers warn, stay single, insist on prenuptial contracts or move to the Mull of Kintyre because Scottish divorce is cheaper. Maybe. But a second, more important thread links the McCartneys to Wednesday's judgment. The Law Lords must decide on blame. The Court of Appeal held Alan Miller responsible for the breakdown of his marriage because of his adultery. As James Stewart, of the law firm Manches, says, this shatters more than 20 years of case law. If the Law Lords conclude that conduct matters, then England can expect a move back to private eyes sifting through crumpled bedlinen and to bitter break-ups in which aberrations are paraded through the courts and children's lives made hellish. The money settled on rich women has no effect at all on poorer ones, who end up on average 18 per cent worse off after their marriage ends. But the revival of fault-based divorce would damage everyone. Though infidelity is not a factor in the McCartney case, this is a story imbued with blame. Heather's potential slice of the money is no one's business, unless it sets some general precedent, which it won't. But that is barely mentioned. Is he too gullible? commentators keep asking. Is she too grasping? The row feeds into a national obsession with guilt and a cult of fault that goes much wider than marriage. Blame is embedded in the modern British DNA. It is what makes government so febrile, cabinet ministers so expendable, jails so full and fear so rampant. Comforting and punitive, it hints at easy remedies where none exists. British life risks becoming a litany of accusation. An accident happens; a terrible crime takes place; a marriage ends. Blame the Human Rights Act, blame the Home Secretary, blame the media, blame a rock star's estranged wife. Some individual, the theory goes, could have prevented these catastrophes. He or she must be singled out and punished. Lessons must be learnt. If only officials were more responsible, laws more draconian and people less prone to marry foolishly, then grim outcomes might all, supposedly, be averted. In a post-religious age, we are fixated by celebrity and a sin-based culture. Gods may be diminished and heroes B-listed, but we can still construct a modern Iliad around an ageing rock star's wartorn marriage. Celebrities are not supposed to be Relate counsellors. They are meant to reflect or illuminate society. The story of the McCartney divorce fulfils that modest criterion. Stuff happens, in marriage as in life. And often there is no moral to be drawn, no villain to be crucified, no blame to be dispensed. mary.riddell@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
