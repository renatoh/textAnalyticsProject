Frankly, at this stage of the season, it is not where I would like it to be. I am hitting it nicely in the practice net and taking a lot of positives forward, but with my quality of ball-striking currently a handicap of six represents just that, a handicap. I could not hit a cow's arse with a banjo. The surprising thing, then, is that during a rare round last week, in the middle of all the scuffing and hacking, came a couple of shots - a three-iron drawn into a left-hand pin and a three-wood from the rough to the heart of the green - that I defy anyone at Oakmont to better today. It happens to all golfers, of course, that sublime moment when fleetingly everything synchronises as it should, the club comes down on the right plane and strikes the ball squarely. Read Betjeman's Seaside Golf and his \"quite unprecedented three\". Which brings me to Liam Plunkett. The young lad has endured three Test matches this summer and even against technicians dealing with a laterally moving ball as bad the West Indies batsmen have been, he has been pretty poor. Now, humanely, he has been told to go back to his county, Durham, and learn to bowl again. Yesterday Matthew Hoggard, who will probably return to the Test team in his stead, said he thought Plunkett's problem was mental. Get his head right and the rest will follow. He does, said Hoggard, bowl some excellent deliveries, but there is a bit of chaff among the wheat. Now the Hogster is a fine bowler, but if Plunkett is taking on board the message that all is well with the exception of the bit between his ears, then he is being deluded: he has a fundamental technical flaw which precludes consistency, absolutely. I referred to golf earlier, because the analogy between the bowling action and the golf swing is so strong. There is room for idiosyncrasy in both (just watch Jim Furyk at the US Open, or Lasith Malinga bowling for Sri Lanka) but everything has to be in place when it matters. The prerequisites for a solid repeating golf swing - grip, stance, posture, alignment - can equally be applied to the bowling action, where, for seam bowlers, anyway, everything should be geared so that the tip of the middle finger of the bowling hand, the last point of contact, is in the optimum position to apply maximum force behind the ball and directly down the line of intended direction in a manner that would have Sir Isaac Newton purring. It does not always demand the pure action of FS Trueman but it doesn't half help when the front arm leads the way, describing an imaginary arc straight down the intended line back to the bowler's feet, and the bowling arm follows. The higher the delivery arm, and the more it takes the lead of the front arm, the more one of the two bowling variables - direction - is taken care of. Yet Plunkett's action, either by accident or design, is a function of the age where biomechanists, taking injury prevention as a primary rather than secondary objective, countenance front-on delivery, with back foot landing at right angles to the crease rather than parallel. What they are trying to achieve is a prevention of back problems through an alignment of upper and lower body rather than one working against the other, a feature of poor actions in general. Myself, I believe that in alleviating one problem they are creating another, in the impingements we are now seeing as a result of ankle flexing. Equally, though, they could coach synchronising the body in a side-on action, with the added benefits of a repeating method. As it stands, unless he can make a major refinement - and that's not easy - Plunkett's natural talent and physical assets will let him hit an awful lot of good three-irons in his career, but there will always be more than his share of hoiks out of bounds. And I'll bet he has an ankle problem within five years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
