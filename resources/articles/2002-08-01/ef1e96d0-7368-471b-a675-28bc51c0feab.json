After Sunday's Hungarian grand prix delivered another resounding 1-2 finish for the bright red cars from Maranello - Rubens Barrichello winning ahead of Michael Schumacher for the second time this year - it is clear that simply waiting for Ferrari to falter is no longer an option. \"We are working very hard at restructuring and reorganising the team,\" said Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman. \"Our aim is to win races, not just to take part.\" To that end, they have recently recruited the former Ferrari gearbox engineer John Sutton while the design chief Neil Oatley has been promoted to engineering director. Yet making the quantum leap forward to beat Ferrari is not merely a question of spending more money and recruiting more brain power. \"Simply gritting our teeth and trying harder is just not going to get the job done,\" said Patrick Head, the Williams technical director. \"We have to learn from Ferrari and implement similar organisational systems.\" David Richards, the team principal at British American Racing, agreed with Head's assessment. He explained: \"Any sport, and particularly a technically complex sport such as formula one, requires a consistently evolving approach to guarantee sustained success. \"That said, I don't see that Ferrari is doing anything which is fundamentally different. They have just concentrated on eliminating as many of the weak points as possible. Which is what we at BAR - and everybody else, for that matter - is trying to do for themselves.\" Until then, Ferrari will remain ahead of the game. Even now, their technical director Ross Brawn is talking in terms of an evolutionary version of the current car for 2003. If it is not immediately competitive, he reasons, the older machine can still be pressed into winning service. Just like this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
