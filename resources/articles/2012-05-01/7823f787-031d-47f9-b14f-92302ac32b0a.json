This week it is different, as the three England bowlers are sprinkling their stardust on a County Championship fixture between Lancashire and Nottinghamshire which was always going to be momentous, as the first to be played on the realigned square at Old Trafford. So Anderson may well bowl the first ball in first-class cricket from the new Brian Statham End that now faces the old pavilion, which would be fitting after he overtook the great Lancashire bowler's tally of 252 Test wickets during the winter. \"I generally try not to get too hung up on things like that,\" Anderson said on Tuesday as he surveyed the rapidly changing appearance of the ground on which he began his first-class career a decade ago. \"But Statham in particular, because he's such a legend especially in Lancashire but also well beyond, it's an amazing thing for me to have gone past him.\" This will also be Anderson's first appearance for a Lancashire team who can call themselves county champions, a title that eluded Statham throughout his 19 seasons at Old Trafford \u2013 although they did share first place with Surrey in his first summer of 1950. International commitments restricted Anderson to a cameo role in their triumph last season, although they won each of the two early-season games in which he played, including a feisty Roses match at Aigburth. Now they need his availability to kickstart their title defence, which opened with consecutive defeats at Aigburth by Sussex and Warwickshire, followed by a rain-ruined draw at Somerset. \"I love coming back and playing,\" said Anderson, who has been made available for one match only, whereas Broad and Swann will stay with Nottinghamshire for a second fixture at home to Andrew Strauss's Middlesex at Trent Bridge next week. \"The two games I did play last year were very eventful, but we won them both. Hopefully this will be another one like that. It's still very early in the season which is a good thing for us so we know that two or three wins is going to get us right back towards the top of the table.\" Anderson's use of the word eventful would doubtless amuse Swann, who has already reflected that his stooge \"was borderline being banned for life against Yorkshire last year, just because he was playing for Lancashire and they hate Yorkshire. He probably wears his heart on his sleeve for his county more than anyone. He will just shout and swear at me.\" \"We've talked about it for quite a while, since we found out that this is the game that we're going to be playing in,\" Anderson said, sticking to his straight\u2011man role, and discussing the prospect of facing Swann's off-spin as one of the left-handers he prefers. \"I don't think I've ever faced him in competitive cricket \u2013 not that I can remember. But I've dominated him in the nets a few times. \"I keep getting phone calls from Broad asking me not to bounce him \u2013 or saying that if I do bounce him I'm getting a few straight back. It's really exciting when you do play a team with international players in it. For the guys in our dressing room, certainly the batters, to be able to bat against two of the top 10 bowlers in the world will be a great challenge for them and something they're really looking forward to.\" All bar two of England's likely team for the first Test of the summer will be playing county cricket this week \u2013 the exceptions being Matt Prior, because Sussex do not have a game, and Kevin Pietersen, who is still in India. Alastair Cook returns to action for Essex alongside Ravi Bopara against Glamorgan in Cardiff, and Tim Bresnan plays in another Division Two fixture for Yorkshire against Leicestershire at Scarborough. Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott team up again for the early-season Division One leaders Warwickshire at Edgbaston against a Durham bowling attack including Graham Onions \u2013 but not Ben Stokes, who is playing as a specialist batsman because of a back problem, or Steve Harmison, who is again omitted. Strauss and Steve Finn must wait until Thursday before Middlesex start their home match against Worcestershire at Lord's."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
