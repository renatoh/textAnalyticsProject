No\u00ebl-Jean Bergeroux, managing director of Journaux du Midi, the newspaper which runs the race, said he felt cycling was not cleaning up its act with sufficient speed. \"There are question marks about the world of cycling at the moment. We've had an ethical charter for the last two years, and the winner of [this year's] final stage got tested positive. In 2001, we had to wait a year for the results of the drug tests.\" Bergeroux added that \"progress in restoring the image of cycling is - to be pleasant about it - very, very slow. We were even more worried about it this year than in 2001. As far as the fight against doping goes, it takes something on a massive scale, like in the Giro [raided by police in 2001] to make any impression.\" The Midi Libre, which started in 1949 and is considered a vital build-up to the Tour, costs the paper some \u00a3300,000 to run, and, like the organisers of Britain's former national tour the Milk Race, they have found sponsors are not attracted to a race which is automatically associated with a particular product. If cycling's flagship event, the Tour, continues to go from strength to strength as its centenary approaches next year, other races are feeling the pressure from two fronts: increased traffic on the roads, which is making organising major races more expensive, and the background of regular doping scandals, which is putting sponsors off. Earlier this year, the second largest event in France, the Paris-Nice \"race to the sun\" was sold in extremis to the Tour organisers after its owner, the double Tour winner Laurent Fignon, realised he faced bankruptcy if he went ahead with it. Fignon blamed the sport's doping problems for his failure to attract sponsors. In Italy this August, the \"Climbers' Trophy\" fell by the wayside, as sponsors became shy after the drug scandals of the Giro d'Italia. \u00b7 Italy's Giovanni Lombardi of the Acqua &amp; Sapone team won the 190km, 13th stage of the Tour of Spain from Burgos to Santander yesterday, as Spain's Oscar Sevilla retained his one-second overall lead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
