According to the Hollywood Reporter, the as-yet-untitled film will come from Todd Phillips, director of The Hangover trilogy and the forthcoming DC Comics prequel Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix. Hemsworth, who will next reprise his role of Thor in Avengers: Endgame, will play the wrestler during his early years and according to sources, the film won\u2019t address his later controversies outside of the ring, including his legal battle with Gawker. The script will come from Scott Silver, whose credits include 8 Mile, The Fighter and Phillips\u2019 foray into the Batman universe. Reportedly a deal is close to being made with Netflix to obtain rights to the film, with Hemsworth and Bradley Cooper also on board as producers. Hogan, born Terry Gene Bollea, will also act as a consultant on the film and an executive producer. His career started in the late 70s in the Florida fighting circuit and by the end of the 80s, he was a worldwide star as part of WWF, now WWE. When Hogan was interviewed in 2013, he expressed interest in Hemsworth playing him. \u201cWe need a serious, serious actor that knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know who I thought would be good? That guy that did that action movie Thor.\u201d As well as his role in the Avengers sequel, Hemsworth will be seen this summer in sci-fi reboot Men in Black: International before starring in the Netflix action drama Dhaka. He was last seen in Bad Times at El Royale. Phillips\u2019 last film as director was 2016\u2019s War Dogs but as producer, he has a credit on A Star is Born alongside Cooper, a longtime collaborator. Joker is set for release later this year, starring Phoenix as the infamous villain in what\u2019s been referred to as a darker, lower-budget character study."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
