Darrell Griffin, a prop who became the first product of the summer conference competition to play in the Super League when he joined Wakefield from the Oxford Cavaliers amateur club five years ago, is now established as a key figure in the Huddersfield pack. But he left his younger brother Josh behind at Belle Vue, and Wakefield's worsening injury crisis has handed the 18-year-old centre a call-up to Trinity's first-team squad. \"The family moved up north when Darrell first signed for Wakefield and Josh has been with us since he was 16,\" explained Trinity's director of rugby, John Kear. \"Even if he doesn't end up playing against his brother this weekend, he's got a great chance of earning a full-time contract with us next year. And the more of these lads we have coming into the Super League from different areas of the country, the better.\" \"All the family will be at the game, so if Josh does play it will be special for all of us,\" said the elder Griffin, who is now 26. He stumbled on league by accident with the Cavaliers, who were one of the founder members of the Rugby League Conference in 1998 - it will kick off its 11th season next weekend with 90 teams - and showed enough promise to earn trials with the London Broncos. However, it was Shane McNally, a Queenslander who was then coaching Wakefield, who first spotted his potential, and he went on to make 92 appearances for Trinity from 2003-06. He had already signed for Huddersfield when Kear arrived to save Wakefield from relegation late in the 2006 season, and had no reason to regret that move last year as the Giants beat Trinity four times en route to their first appearance in the top-six play-offs. They have struggled to build on that achievement so far this year. Last Friday's home defeat by Catalans Dragons left them 10th in the table with only three wins from their first 10 games. However, Griffin goes into this latest clash against his former club with the rare record for a prop of having scored a try in each of the last three matches. \"I'm not renowned for my try-scoring but I'm carrying a few extra pounds this year and am a lot fitter so maybe that is getting me across the line,\" he said. \"It's always a great atmosphere against Wakefield and there is added spice for me. The Wakey fans always single me out for some stick and I still know a fair few of their players so there will be some extra banter on the field.\" There will be some unfamiliar Wakefield faces even to Griffin tonight, however, as Kear has 10 players injured, including the former Huddersfield hooker Brad Drew, while Adam Watene has returned to New Zealand for compassionate leave. They still managed to beat Warrington 16-2 last Sunday, but all four of their victories this season have come at home. \"Wakefield respond to adversity well,\" said Huddersfield's coach, Jon Sharp. \"I think the coach breeds that into them. They are a team that scraps for one another and I certainly think they did that against Warrington, when Danny Brough's kicking game was superb.\" Huddersfield are still missing Stephen Wild, David Hodgson and Martin Aspinwall, but they are hopeful of having Shane Elford and Rod Jensen back to boost their backline. Bradford will be without their scrum-half and captain Paul Deacon for the first time this season in tomorrow's only Super League fixture at Hull KR. He will be missing for two weeks to have a minor knee operation but his absence is offset by the return from injury of Glenn Morrison and David Solomona, while Terry Newton is back after suspension. Rovers are missing their former Great Britain centre Chev Walker, who could be out for a month after suffering wrist ligament damage in the defeat at Harlequins last Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
