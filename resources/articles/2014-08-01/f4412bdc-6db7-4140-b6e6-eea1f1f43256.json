As the sassy cover shot suggests, they are a more assertive, shadowed presence here, with producer Ken Coomer extending their musical palette and demanding more original songs. The result is a fine and varied set; My Baby Loves Me smoulders, You Don't Have the Heart For It is country heartbreak, and Sing to Me a delicate love call. Their bluegrass take on Richard Thompson's death disc, 1952 Vincent Black Lightning, whose heroine inspired their name, is overdue, nimbly played and appropriately thrilling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
