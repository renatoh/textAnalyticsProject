A survey by the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) last month found that 40% of local services said they had not received any budget increases. Two-thirds of local heads of midwifery reported that they did not have enough midwives to cope with the workload in their unit. \"Despite recent and welcome increases in the numbers of midwives and plans to recruit more, the figures show that the increase is not keeping pace with the birthrate,\" the RCM said. The college fears that the government target of 3,400 more midwives will not be enough \u2013 if the birthrate continues to rise \u2013 \"to deliver a high-quality service\". It suggests that 5,000 new midwives are required. The shortage is most serious in the south-east of England where as many as 12.6% of all posts are unfilled. Addressing the RCM's annual conference in November, the Conservative health spokesman, Andrew Lansley, described the service as \"currently overstretched and patchy\". The birthrate has risen 18.6% since 2001."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
