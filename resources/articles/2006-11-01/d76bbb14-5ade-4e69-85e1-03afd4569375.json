Earlier this year, PPM Sales went into liquidation, taking months of my rental income with it. But when I tried to claim, HomeLet said I had no policy, and even if I had it would not cover me for PPM's failure. Can you help? MC Taiwan When Capital Letters first contacted HomeLet, it said you did not have insurance at all as PPM had not forwarded the premiums. PPM was appointed as an agent for HomeLet but this was terminated in April 2005. Capital Letters argued that HomeLet had a responsibility as it appointed PPM. Furthermore, had it kept proper control of those acting in its name, you would not have been in this mess. You have lost nearly \u00a32,500, including your tenants'deposit. Unbeknown to Capital Letters, you also sent your problem to another newspaper (the Times) which, two weeks ago, concluded you had no chance. It said: \"Your argument that PPM Sales was acting as an agent for HomeLet is unlikely to hold water.\" But this column persisted. And now we have had success. HomeLet said the non-payment of premiums took place prior to tougher insurance sales regulations in April 2005. As a goodwill gesture, it has decided to backdate its responsibility and it will now send you a \u00a32,500 cheque. AstraDelph debt scam targets elderly people My elderly aunt received a letter from AstraDelph International Debt Collection threatening litigation for money she supposedly owed to Amikanelectronics.com. Have others been contacted in this way? JS Cardiff AstraDelph claims to be in Prague but probably is not - the phones are in Liechtenstein, but they could be anywhere. The \"creditor\" is imaginary. This is a scam targeted at elderly people. AstraDelph threatens court action or doorstep collectors if no payment is sent. Thousands of these letters have been sent out over the past few weeks, leading to an Office of Fair Trade warning. But while AstraDelph has been rumbled, there will be copycat demands. Regent Street adviser was made up in India I was called by someone who said her name was Betty James from DFA in Regent Street, London. She passed me on to Stella Jones who asked me lots of questions about my mortgage. Who is DFA? I can't find them in the London phone book - and why was I called when I had signed up for the Telephone Preference Service? MA London DFA stands for Department of Financial Advisers, but you won't find it in Regent Street or anywhere else as it only exists in the imagination of Delhi call centre Globex. The names you quote are equally fanciful. Globex has still to explain how it found your name and number - while TPS rules do not exist in India, UK firms that use Indian call centres are supposed to abide by TPS rules. Globex told you it had links with 55 UK banks and building societies. That is not true either. But it does have ties to some second mortgage brokers, including e-loans in Southend. E-loans chief John Jury this week terminated his firm's two-month trial with Globex. He said he only wanted leads from \"opt-in\" customers who had expressed an interest in borrowing. Globex says it has sacked Betty and Stella as \"rogue employees\". Don't throw good money after bad I was phoned by Regency Consultants in Dubai, which persuaded me to invest in Transglobal Oil Corporation; I bought \u00a33,643 worth of shares at $3.65. Then I was pestered by frequent calls to buy more - the Regency people told me to watch the price rising on Bloomberg. They then tried to sell me more at the current $7.75 price. I terminated the call. Was I right? TS Somerset Yes. This is a typical high pressure sales trick - suck investors in for a relatively small amount, tell them the price is rising and then get some more out of them. You would simply have been throwing good money after bad - your chances of recouping your original \u00a33,643 are minimal for, despite the rise in the share price on paper, you cannot sell them for at least a year because Transglobal is a \"regulation S\" stock. Even then, assuming the price does not crash when Regency stops selling them, who is going to buy them? Dubai-based Regency is not regulated by the Financial Services Authority - and its website is light on information such as ownership. As for Transglobal, it is a \"development stage company\", formerly known as Simplicity Computer. It promises to have profitable solutions for the heavy end of the oil refining industry. As it has yet to file any returns with US watchdog Securities and Exchange Commission, there is no way of knowing its financial backing or sales record. Sour grapes from Orange insurance I have an Orange phone contract, paying handset insurance. After a few weeks, the handset stopped working. After long and expensive phone calls, Orange finally promised a replacement. We agreed a time for changing the phones. I took time off work. No phone arrived. After another long call, Orange admitted a courier problem. I asked for an apology and compensation but was told complaints could not be lodged over the phone. Can you help? RM Somerset Your insurance is an expensive waste - Orange would have had to replace a handset which failed so soon under consumer law. Your phone calls were also an expensive waste. Following a Capital Letters intervention, Orange has apologised for your inconvenience. As for compensation, Orange is refunding your phone return fee and crediting you with a free month on your contract. Hardly a generous offer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
