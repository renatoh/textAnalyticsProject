One was that her own mother was a fan of Dickinson\u2019s work, so much so that the young Krakowski could recite a few of the poet\u2019s greatest hits by rote. The script, then, immediately piqued her interest. \u201cIt\u2019s changed now,\u201d she explains, \u201cbut in the original, it started with: \u2018I\u2019m Nobody! Who are you?\u2019 And she reads the whole poem. At the end she looks into the camera and she goes: \u2018I\u2019m Emily. I\u2019m Emily fucking Dickinson.\u2019 I was like, wait. What is this?\u201d She smiles: \u201cThis is not your mom\u2019s Emily Dickinson.\u201d Krakowski also wanted to play a character who would be entirely unlike two of her best-known roles, 30 Rock\u2019s Jenna \u201cListen up fives, a 10 is speaking\u201d Maroney and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u2019s Jacqueline White/Voorhees, another of her immaculate, iconic narcissists, a spoof of the 1%. They are two of the greatest comedy characters of recent times. Krakowski is in London to promote her shift to the sort-of period, sort-of drama of Dickinson, but she is a devoted Anglophile, particularly when it comes to comedy. She had her first experience of panto last Christmas, when she took her son to see Julian Clary in Dick Whittington. \u201cHe was hilarious. He seemed like the king of panto. I had the best time. I was like, why have I waited so long to go? My son didn\u2019t know all the double entendre jokes and he said, why are you guys all laughing so hard? I said, one day, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d Dickinson follows over a decade of Krakowski being Tina Fey\u2019s favourite sort-of bad guy. Kimmy Schmidt and 30 Rock left her comedically fulfilled in a way that made her wonder what to do next. \u201cI think I came out of that going: \u2018There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to top that kind of comedic writing. So let\u2019s go for something entirely different, to have a whole other experience.\u2019\u201d Whisper it, but the fact that Krakowski is playing the conservative mother of a 19th-century poet in a modern-historical hybrid with a thumping contemporary soundtrack, in which Wiz Khalifa has a cameo as Death, is quite, well, Jenna Maroney. Jenna is every excess of a celebrity turned up to 11; when Tina Fey\u2019s Liz Lemon describes her as a \u201chigh-strung perfectionist\u201d, she zings back: \u201cI prefer soul-sucking monster.\u201d Krakowski arrived on 30 Rock after the unaired pilot, in which a far less ego-driven Jenna was played by comic actor Rachel Dratch. She was in Guys and Dolls in the West End when Fey and Robert Carlock, who co-produced the show, asked Krakowski for a meeting. \u201cThey wanted to see what sort of sense of humour I had about myself, because the part was to send up the entity that is an actress. I couldn\u2019t think of anything more fun than to get to exploit the worst traits of actors and live them fully on screen, because then you get it out of your system and you don\u2019t have to do it in real life, in a way,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI could take every horror story I had ever heard and put it into Jenna.\u201d One of Jenna\u2019s many talents was an ability to belt out a tune at the drop of a hat, which was written into the scripts as a result of Krakowski\u2019s Broadway experience. Did she have favourites? \u201cI feel like Jenna was most known for Muffin Top, and, of course, Werewolf Bar Mitzvah [sung by co-star Tracy Morgan], which went viral before viral was a thing. [Kimmy Schmidt\u2019s] Titus Burgess sent me a clip that I had totally forgotten about. It was a commercial I made in Japan ...\u201d She laughs. \u201cAnd all I do is hold up a soda, and somebody slaps me, and then I just keep smiling and drinking the soda. We got to do such outrageously fun things as part of that show.\u201d After 30 Rock, Fey and Carlock wrote the part of Kimmy Schmidt\u2019s Jacqueline, a woman running from her past by hiding behind the self-involved grandeur of New York society wives, specifically for Krakowski. At what point does she start taking that kind of casting personally? \u201cI think people feel that Jenna and Jacqueline are quite similar,\u201d she says, gamely, \u201cand I do think the cadence of the comedy is very similar because it\u2019s written by the same people. But I\u2019ve always felt that they were very different characters, certainly in the approach that I take to them, because Jacqueline was a far more vulnerable person than Jenna ever was or could possibly be.\u201d For a comedy, she adds, Kimmy Schmidt was incredibly dark. \u201cYou break that down and you\u2019re like: it\u2019s about a woman who\u2019s been kidnapped for 15 years and comes out of a bunker ...\u201d The show will end for good with an interactive special, due at the start of 2020. Does she think she will work with Fey and Carlock again? \u201cI would be so thrilled to do something else. I\u2019d like to convince them that it\u2019s three times a charm.\u201d Now 51, Krakowski grew up in the suburbs of New Jersey where her parents\u2019 hobby was community theatre. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the funds to get babysitters all the time, so they would bring me with them.\u201d Her mother sent her to open calls when she was a child. \u201cI admired the moxie she had to give me the confidence to maybe just go try,\u201d she says. Her son Bennett is now eight, the same age as Krakowski was when she first started going to auditions, but she doesn\u2019t yet know if he\u2019ll follow in the family business. \u201cHe\u2019s naturally very funny,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019ll do comedy bits at home, and I\u2019ll be like: \u2018Wait, how would you know that?\u2019 But I haven\u2019t felt his need for applause, or to be seen or heard in that way, which is probably psychologically more healthy. I don\u2019t want to necessarily keep him away from it, but I\u2019ll let him find his own way, if that\u2019s what he wants to do.\u201d She got her first TV role in the early 80s as a teenager, on the daytime NBC soap Search for Tomorrow. \u201cI was in high school when I was on that show, so I was doing my homework on the bus ride during my commute.\u201d After she made her career on Broadway \u2013 in the likes of Starlight Express, Grand Hotel, Company and Nine \u2013 she returned to TV in 1997 as Elaine, the office assistant in Ally McBeal who invented the \u201cface bra\u201d. Krakowski still has one at home. \u201cIt was nice to have a souvenir, and I think that was the epitome of Elaine\u2019s inventions.\u201d Ally McBeal was a genuine phenomenon. \u201cInternationally, too,\u201d she notes, \u201cwhich I had never experienced before. I think, apart from Courtney Thorne-Smith [who played McBeal\u2019s love rival, Georgia], none of us had been on a TV show.\u201d She moved from New York to LA to work on it, and remembers being in her car, driving back from the set, hearing a radio show analysing a recent episode. \u201cThat\u2019s when I think we all realised it was what we now call a watercooler show.\u201d It changed their lives completely. \u201cFar more for Calista [Flockhart] than for the rest of us. I think people felt Calista was Ally McBeal for a very long time, and she had to work very hard at making people realise that she was not that character, because she played it so beautifully. Many of the characters that I\u2019ve played, especially in the TV shows I\u2019ve been on, have been very heightened and exaggerated, and so I haven\u2019t felt that people think I am my characters.\u201d When it comes to Jenna Maroney and Jacqueline White, that\u2019s probably a very good thing.
