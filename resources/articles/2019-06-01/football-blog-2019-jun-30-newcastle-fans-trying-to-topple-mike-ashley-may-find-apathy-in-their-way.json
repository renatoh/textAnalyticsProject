An excoriating, potentially award-winning polemic that will now never see the light of day, the original version was mildly critical of the kind of football fans who relentlessly bore everyone to tears with grievances regarding their dissatisfaction with the owners of their football club, but are invariably too apathetic to do anything even remotely useful that might in some way lead to the departure of those custodians who are the source of so much disgruntlement. Like those fabled match reports quickly deleted by panicking football writers when Manchester United staged a late smash-and-grab on Bayern Munich\u2019s Champions League hopes two decades ago, the column I had written was largely accurate but ultimately rendered nonsensical by a late, unexpected intervention. As if sensing Newcastle fans were about to be singled out and publicly belittled for repeatedly complaining about Mike Ashley without ever doing anything that might reasonably be expected to help get rid of him, one website devoted to doing exactly that finally invoked the nuclear option and actually called upon fans to stop attending the team\u2019s games. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d they thundered. \u201cFrom today, AshleyOut.com is urging all fans to participate in a full boycott of St James\u2019 Park, club merchandise and businesses associated with the club until Mike Ashley leaves the club.\u201d As clarion calls go, it could scarcely be more commendable but given the years of stagnation their club has been forced to endure under its despised owner, you could be forgiven for wondering what took them so long to take up the megaphone. It is no secret that the lot of Newcastle fans has been a largely unhappy one for the vast majority of the dozen years since the billionaire owner of Sports Direct bought the club. Understandably weary of seeing the venerable institution they love so much stuck in a state of almost total moribundity, they have staged protests \u2013 however well-intentioned but useless \u2013 before. Following last week\u2019s news that Rafael Ben\u00edtez would be leaving the club after the expiration of his contract, a small group of angry men convened peacefully beneath the bronze feet of Sir Bobby Robson\u2019s statue at St James\u2019 Park to make known their displeasure at Ashley\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for keeping the Spaniard on the books. While their gesture should be applauded, the presence of no more than 40 of them is unlikely to have prompted anything in the way of a reaction from the subject of their derision beyond a shoulder-shrug and trademark self-satisfied smirk. In December last year, the Magpie Group hatched upon the wheeze of making their contempt for their club\u2019s owner known by refusing to take their seats for a home game against West Ham until the 11th minute. It was, they said, a protest they hoped would \u201cbring global attention to the repulsive way Ashley runs the club\u201d, but a general lack of enthusiasm meant it went almost totally unnoticed and did little of the sort. While the 11th minute was chosen to signify the number of years Ashley had owned the club, one can\u2019t help but feel that it was no coincidence it also meant those protesting wouldn\u2019t miss very much of the game. Like fans of so many other English football clubs, those who religiously attend St James\u2019 Park tend to talk a good game when it comes to the public airing of grievances but generally come up short when it comes to doing anything that might detract from their enjoyment of actual football. Few protests encapsulate this half-heartedness as accurately as the utterly empty gesture that is the pre-match \u201cmarch\u201d, in which fans are called upon to mobilise outside a pub many of them were almost certainly going to be drinking in anyway, before walking a couple of hundred yards in a slightly emboldened manner to a game they had always planned to attend. One of the more memorable and protracted industrial actions in recent decades, the 1980s miners\u2019 strike might ultimately have been unsuccessful, but at least those participating in it didn\u2019t protest by donning helmets, going down the pits and digging coal. By urging all Newcastle fans to boycott St James\u2019 Park completely, the folk behind AshleyOut.com have raised the bar significantly and it will be interesting to see the reaction to their cri de coeur. Not so much \u201choway\u201d as \u201cstay howay\u201d, one can\u2019t help but feel it is unlikely to gain much traction due in no small part to the disparate nature of Newcastle United\u2019s various fan groups and their apparent inability to agree on anything resembling a coherent, workable plan. \u201cIf you choose to turn up to St James\u2019 Park while Ashley owns the club you are welcome to do so,\u201d added AshleyOut.com in its manifesto and there will undoubtedly be no shortage of fans who find the thought of not attending their team\u2019s matches unbearable as they feel it is they and the players who will suffer, rather than the Ashley regime. Despite their understandable reservations, in a one-club city with the Premier League\u2019s seventh highest average attendance, the sight of more than 50,000 empty seats on match days would constitute one hell of a statement. It is one that is unlikely to be made."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
