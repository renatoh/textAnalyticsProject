And just to prove it, the Betis winger wore a t-shirt yesterday which read \"To my family - I love you\". But while Betis's more sentimental fans go gooey over the Brazilian's golden heart - and the rest reach for the sick bucket - it's on the pitch that Denilson is really winning them over. Three years after his arrival, he's finally showing what he can do and it's paying off. Yesterday's 2-0 win over Valladolid puts the First Division newcomers third, just one point off the top. Juande Ramos's side probably won't stay there, but they shouldn't go back down. Indeed, they might even fight for a European place. After all, Denilson isn't alone. Last year's revelation, playmaker Jes\u00fas Capit\u00e1n Prado - Capi to his mates - has been joined by other homemade talents, including Fernando Varela, who yesterday opened the scoring with a ridiculously long-range strike. Moreover, last week's defeat of Madrid has shown that Betis can mix it with the big boys. Not that Juande is getting carried away. \"Although the fans are euphoric\", he said, \"we've only got nine points\". Betis might not stay at the top, but Spain's early leaders could. With Valencia dropping points in a 2-2 draw against Bilbao, Celta are top with a point lead over Galician rivals Depor, who beat Alav\u00e9s 3-2. It wasn't this weekend's win itself, so much as the manner of it that augers so well for Celta fans. Forever the unlucky entertainers, the fantasy footballers with no cutting edge and a defence as brittle as Jeffrey Archer, things have changed in Vigo. Celta are yet to concede a goal and this weekend got a rub or two of the green - referee L\u00f3pez Nieto turned down two clear penalty shouts for Mallorca as Celta won 2-0. Manager V\u00edctor Fern\u00e1ndez is playing down title talk. \"We need to be serious, despite being top\", he said, putting on his most earnest face. \"I know who's going to win the league and that's Madrid\". Mallorca's affable manager Bernd Krauss disagreed. In the nicest possible way, of course. \"I like Celta a lot\", he cooed, \"I think they can win the league\". Just when you thought it was a normal press conference, it turned into a sickly love-in. Told about Krauss's sweet nothings, Fern\u00e1ndez fluttered his eyelashes: \"Mallorca are a great side, one of the best in Spain. They could win the league\", he simpered. Heart-warming. Just like Denilson. Fear not, aggro fans - there wasn't much love on the pitch. First up, Catanha got a bloody head courtesy of Fernando Ni\u00f1o's elbow (an attack Catanha sought to avenge, naturally). Then there was the Celta ballboy who viciously assaulted Mallorca's Cristi\u00e1n D\u00edaz. Unimpressed with the faltering attempts to fish the ball from the ditch around the Bala\u00eddos pitch, D\u00edaz decided to take matters into his own hands. Grabbing the fishing net - and it really was a fishing net - the Mallorca man retrieved the ball himself, only to be clipped round the head by the ballboy, who immediately became a local hero. Completing the early Champions League places are Villarreal. After torrential rain and a forty-five minute delay, Saturday night's match against Real Sociedad finally went ahead on a pitch as wet as Chesney Hawkes. Mart\u00edn Palermo scored the only goal. Real Sociedad m\u00edster John Benjamin wasn't shirking the pain: \"It hurts to say it, but they were far better\", he grimaced. Sociedad find themselves in a horribly familiar position - bottom with only Rayo, 2-1 losers in Sevilla, for company. For Bar\u00e7a and Madrid, it was time for the new boys to silence the doubters. Javier Saviola scored a fabulous late goal to secure a 2-0 win over Tenerife, while new keeper Roberto Bonano proved to be nowhere near as funny as Richard Dutruel, but around forty times as effective. Not that Bar\u00e7a convince, however. The few fans who turned up at the sodden Camp Nou spent much of the game berating beak-nosed boss Charly Rexach, while Tenerife coach Pepe Mel admitted that he \"didn't think much\" of Barcelona. Things are better at the Bernab\u00e9u - on the pitch, anyway. It turns out that Zidane's not a bad player after all. With the Frenchman playing in the middle of midfield, Madrid destroyed Espanyol 5-1. Zidane opened the scoring on five minutes, with Roberto Carlos, Figo, Ra\u00fal and McManaman adding the rest. And it could have been more, too - Espanyol keeper Alfredo Argenso made some excellent stops. Great saves, bad social skills - \"Madrid have got good players, we haven't\", said the dressing-room favourite. Everyone might be talking about Zidane - just for a change, like - but after four whole weeks without, isn't it about time this column raved about Steve McManaman? No, not at all. Let's leave that to Johan Cruyff. After all, he does it so well. \"There's something I'd like to highlight\", wrote the Bar\u00e7a legend on Sunday morning. \"It's something I consider vital for this Madrid side, and it's the presence of McManaman. The Englishman is the axis that gives Madrid the balance they need, allowing them to be well positioned on the field\". Hang on, he's not finished yet: \"His presence gives a solidity to the left side that Roberto Carlos alone can't offer\". Ah, Roberto Carlos, the other man they're talking about. With the crowd chanting his name, Thunder Thighs celebrated his goal by running towards the director's box, grabbing his ears. The message was clear - \"Listen to that, you bastards\". You see, Roberto wants a new contract, \"more love\" as he puts it. He's not happy that Ra\u00fal, Figo and Zidane get more \"love\" than him. So, as befits the modern footballer, Roberto Carlos is after 1000 million pesetas (\u00a34m) a year, a pop-star wife and a mock-Tudor mansion in the Cheshire countryside. Madrid, though, won't budge and Roberto - who wasn't invited to share last week's \"captain's lunch\" with Hierro, Raul, Guti and El Presidente, is, apparently, \"hurt\". They're a sentimental bunch. \u0095 Email Sid Lowe at sidlowe@telefonica.net"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
