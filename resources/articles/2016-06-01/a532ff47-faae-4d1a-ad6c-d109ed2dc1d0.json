Simon Stevens, chief executive, said the data provided \u201cunvarnished feedback to every hospital and trust across the NHS about the experiences of their BME staff\u201d. The figures are published in NHS England\u2019s report on how the service is responding to \u2018work equality\u2019 standards. This involved researchers digging deeper into staff surveys, which have already indicated worrying levels of work-related stress and harassment caused by co-workers and bosses, as well as by patients and the public. About 14% of respondents to the surveys were from a BME background, while 86% were white. Stevens said the report \u201cconfirms that while some employers have got it right, for many others these staff survey results are deeply concerning and a clear call to action\u201d. Joan Saddler, a co-chair of the NHS equality and diversity council, was blunter, saying the report detailed data that \u201ctrusts have traditionally collected but generally failed to act upon\u201d. The report looks at indicators across trusts running acute hospital services, ambulances, community services and mental health and learning disability services. Three-quarters of the 154 trusts show higher percentages of BME workers being harassed, bullied or abused by staff than white NHS workers. Only 22% (33 trusts) showed a lower percentage of BME staff reporting such treatment than white staff, while five organisations suggested no difference between the experience of white and BME staff. In 86% of acute trusts, higher percentages of BME staff did not believe their organisation offered them equal opportunities for career progression or promotion compared with white staff. In only slightly fewer trusts, BME staff said they had personally experienced discrimination from a manager, team leader or colleague. However across acute trusts as a whole, reports of abuse and harassment from patients, relatives or the public were similar for BME and white staff. In six of ten ambulance trusts more white staff reported problems of abuse and harassment from patients and public than BME staff. There were gaps in responses at two trusts and in two others BME staff were more likely to experience such trouble. But when it came to staff-on-staff abuse, this was more likely to be experienced by BME ambulance workers. Higher percentages of BME staff said they had suffered harassment and abuse from patients and public in both community health trusts and those responsible for services treating people with mental health issues and learning disabilities. Larger proportions of BME staff than white workers reported staff abuse towards them in two-thirds of community providers. More BME staff than white in nearly four in five mental health and learning disability trusts reported such experiences. A report by Roger Kline, then at Middlesex University, for the NHS two years ago \u2013 The Snowy White Peaks of the NHS \u2013 found BME staff were treated less favourably than white staff in recruitment, career development, membership on trust boards and disciplinary action. They were also more victimised if they were whistleblowers. Kline, now an NHS director responsible for improving standards in this area, said: \u201cThis report holds a mirror to the service and underlines the challenge we face.\u201d Yvonne Coghill, who has a similar role, said: \u201cWe hope the content of the report will encourage organisations to improve the treatment of BME staff and contribute to improved care for patients.\u201d Christina McAnea, head of health at the union Unison, said the figures indicated the extent of problems faced by BME staff. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong for anybody to face harassment or discrimination at work. Generations of black staff helped to establish and maintain the NHS and it continues to depend on their dedicated contribution.\u201d Stephen Dorrell, a former Conservative health secretary who chairs the NHS Confederation, the body that represents organisations planning, commissioning and providing state health services in England, said the latest findings challenged the NHS \u201cto recognise the gap between rhetoric and reality remains uncomfortably large\u201d. NHS England has also issued guidance to bolster initiatives announced in March to increase health food choices on NHS sites and to improve health and wellbeing schemes for staff at work, including running clubs, fitness classes, physiotherapy, and mindfulness courses. Trusts have been urged to promote cycle-to-work schemes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
