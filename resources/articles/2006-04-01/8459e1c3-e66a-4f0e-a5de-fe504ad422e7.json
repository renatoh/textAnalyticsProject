A mass movement for democracy has thrown down a gauntlet to the King, who usurped power from an elected assembly 14 months ago. While the army and police are heavily equipped and dressed in armoured riot gear, the people they brutalise are dressed in T-shirts and sandals. Those who so bravely put their lives on the line as part of a fight for democratic rights deserve the support of trade unionists, human rights activists and anti-globalisation protesters in the west. In the last week there have been solidarity protests around the world, and these are reported by some of the news outlets that reach the Nepalese people. Therefore we call for an emergency protest in solidarity with the Nepalese movement for democracy. This protest will be both a condemnation of the violence used against the democracy movement and a celebration of the resistance of the Nepali people. Therefore, it will continue even if the King grants concessions in the meantime. We will picket the Royal Nepalese Embassy at 12a Kensington Palace Gardens, London, on Saturday April 29 at 1pm. It would mean a lot if you could join us and spread the word. Please bring banners and placards with you.
