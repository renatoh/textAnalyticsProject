She qualified in July 2001 and went to Oxford Brooks University to do a BEd. She is now a supply teacher with the Teaching Personnel agency. My best day came about on a school trip to the Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail. As I had never arranged a trip before I worked closely with the year 4 teacher to learn from her what needed to be done. I recalled from my time at university a risk assessment had to be undertaken which meant visiting the sculpture park and noting anything that may cause accidents - for example, steep hills or streams. Doing the research gave my colleague and me peace of mind because we knew what to expect and felt fully prepared. There were 52 children on the trip split into groups of four and five and each group allocated an adult. My class can be a difficult group and behaviour on this trip was a real worry. But the day proved a real pleasure - we came back totally relaxed and stress free. The children were brilliant, enjoying every part of the day, and we were really proud of them. We had chosen the Sculpture Trail because it was great preparation for an 'art week' that was to follow, the final outcome being a display of work and a parent assembly which involved the children presenting their work. It proved really memorable. I learned a lot from my colleague and I can confidently say now that I could arrange a school trip. My worst day happened when I was teaching a class of 11-year-olds and there was tension among a group of boys. There was a load of verbal abuse and threats made to another boy in the class whom they believed to be a \"swot\". At this point I imposed my authority - I may be just 5 ft 3, but I can really shout - and the boys stopped. But later the victimised boy lashed out at one of the boys causing the tension. I attempted to separate them, but the victimised boy started to have a problem with his breathing and began to cough. By this point I was really stressed and unsure of what to do, so I sent the child next door to calm down. At the end of the day I came away from that class mentally exhausted and at the point of tears. But the experience has not put me off. It was just a bad day and most teachers get those. So do children. In any case, I enjoy challenges and will not be defeated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
