Thousands of young people who are sent to children\u2019s homes up to 100 miles (161km) from their homes are becoming magnets for paedophiles and gangs who use children to traffic drugs from inner-city areas to provincial towns, according to evidence sent to the all-party parliamentary group for runaway and missing children and adults. More than 70% of the 41 police forces that responded to the inquiry said placing children out of area increased their risk of exploitation, often resulting in them being coerced into going missing. The inquiry, supported by the Children\u2019s Society, heard that local authorities may also be inadvertently opening up new county lines drug operations. These dealers will use dedicated mobile phone lines to take orders from drug users. It was found that relocating children who have been groomed to sell heroin and crack cocaine can create opportunities for criminals to expand their reach into rural areas. There was evidence that county lines gangs have been sent to locations where young people are predominantly placed out of area to scout opportunities to recruit new members. Ann Coffey, the MP who chaired the inquiry, said: \u201cIt is a national scandal that local authorities are unwittingly becoming recruiting sergeants for county lines drugs gangs by sending so many children miles away. It must stop. \u201cChildren are being systematically failed and placed in grave danger by the very professionals who are there to protect them.\u201d Mark Russell, the chief executive of the Children\u2019s Society, said the inquiry should be \u201ca wake-up call for urgent action at both the national and local level \u2026 These children are some of the most vulnerable in society. It is vital their needs are put at the centre of all decisions about their placement.\u201d Despite a government promise to clamp down on out-of-area placements, numbers have soared since the parliamentary group first raised concerns in 2012. In 2018, 64% of young people in children\u2019s homes lived out of area, up from 46% in 2012, data from the Department for Education shows. Coffey said the situation was at \u201ccrisis point\u201d. The report says the government must come up with an emergency plan to reduce the number of out-of-area placements, which do not keep children safe. The report also focused on the growing number of young people sent to unregulated semi-independent accommodation. Eighty per cent of the 41 police forces that gave evidence expressed concern about these establishments because, unlike children\u2019s homes, they are not regulated or inspected. Police concerns about unregulated 16-plus accommodation included children left isolated and targeted by those wishing to exploit them for sex or to run drugs. One girl who had been sexually exploited was housed with a perpetrator of child sexual exploitation. The inquiry recommends regulation and inspection of semi-independent accommodation for those aged 16 and over. Rachel Dickinson, the president of the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services, said: \u201cSafeguarding is everyone\u2019s business and local authorities, the police, health services and schools, who share our legal safeguarding duty, and the community must work together to keep children safe, particularly if a child is new to the area. \u201cThe suggestion in this report that local authorities are acting as \u2018recruiting sergeants\u2019 is wholly inappropriate and we are in dialogue with the report authors directly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
