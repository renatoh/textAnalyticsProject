It has the same gentle fluency, the same feeling for a visual flourish \u2013 though I wonder if it is all a bit insubstantial. A farmer and his family with a minor business producing honey are offered two opportunities for cash. One is when the social services offer them money to look after a 14-year-old boy who has been ordered into a family rehab programme. The other is when they get the chance to compete for a wacky TV competition in which the contestants are farmers \u2013 hosted by no less a person than Monica Bellucci, in a queenly cameo. These remarkable events have a potent effect on the family\u2019s mature and thoughtful eldest daughter, Gelsomina (Maria Alexandra Lungu), accelerating her entry into womanhood; the \u201cwonders\u201d of the title could mean those natural unheralded wonders of nature that occur when children start to become grownups independent of their mum and dad. A likable, if sentimental movie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
