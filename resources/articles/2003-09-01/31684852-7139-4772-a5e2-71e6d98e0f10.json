Everything we were fighting against won, and we did not stand for what we believed in. Before September 11, I was very politically active. I would spend all my school holidays doing voluntary work in the shantytowns and the countryside. I also picked wheat and potatoes to help increase production. I felt 100% part of all the reforms that were happening. It was an amazing time, a real awakening. On the day of the coup, I went to school like any other day. At 9am, someone came in my classroom and said: \"There are tanks everywhere. The streets are full of policemen and soldiers.\" I thought: \"Orders will come from above, and we will learn how to resist.\" But no one came. At 7pm, some people from the party came to take some of us in safe houses. After three days there, the orders came from above: we should go home. I felt numb. How could they tell us to go home when all these horrible things were happening? We should have stayed there and fought. I felt that my life was passing by and I could not have any control over it. After the coup, the situation became completely surreal. On the surface, everything was normal. I was going to school, the buses and the trains were running, the shops were open. Everything was the same, but for the presence of the military. They were everywhere, and they had the power of life and death over everyone. A month after the coup, my dad was reported missing. Under Allende, he was his highest representative, an intendente, in the province of Nuble. My mother was in agony, trying to find out what had happened to him, while my sister was visiting the morgues and the hospitals. Two months later, we learned that he was in a concentration camp on Quiriquina island, in the south. Every day, I went on my own to the town where boats were leaving for the island, to try to see him. I just wanted to be near him, to see if there is something I could do for him. I did not realise it was very dangerous. But my dad did, and when he found out I was there, he managed to send me a message, saying: \"Leave now. It's an order. If hell does exist, Pinochet has managed to create it.\" Recently, he told us the military had staged his execution three times. Every time, the soldiers would shoot blank bullets. The military also took my brother Ernesto. He was a wonderful, charismatic young man, who had been adopted by my parents because he lived on the streets. I still don't know what happened to him. He was probably tortured and killed. I came to Britain because a friend of mine, Sandra, was arrested. I saw the news of her arrest on the television and I told my mother I knew her. She said I should sleep at my aunt's house for the night, for safety. I did not want to leave, I was desperate, but eventually I did. The next morning, my little brother Jimmy came to my aunt's house. He said I could not go back because men from the Dina [the Chilean secret police] had come. They had brought Sandra with her. My mother later told me she looked a shadow of her former self. I went into hiding between September and December 1974, until my mother managed to get me and my brothers and sisters out of the country, to Britain. Today, I am the mother of two wonderful, healthy children and I love life. I have carried on fighting for justice ever since my arrival. When Pinochet was arrested, I saw the occasion as a second chance. For 503 days, the entire time he was in Britain, I did everything I could and more. Every Saturday, we would go to Virginia Waters [where Pinochet was living] and read the names of the victims, so that he would hear them. I feel so proud about what we did. I don't think there will be justice for the victims, because the Chilean government ignores the whole issue. They say we should move on, but how can we, when our friends and relatives are still missing, and the perpetrators, from Pinochet down, are free? Our fight now is about preserving the truth so that future generations know what really happened in Chile on September 11. \u00b7 Interview by Gwladys Fouch\u00e9"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
