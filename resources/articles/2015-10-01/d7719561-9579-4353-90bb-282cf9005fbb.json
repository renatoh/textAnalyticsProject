The Bluescope plant on Denham Rd in Tyabb was under threat from a bushfire on Tuesday morning but firefighters from 27 fire trucks managed to contain it. Bushfires at Woodend north of Melbourne, and Magpie near Ballarat, have also been brought under control. A fire broke out in the Otway Ranges about 3pm on Monday and burned through 10 hectares of bush before it was controlled in the evening. Brad Carter, who lost his home at Wensleydale, near Anglesea, said the blaze took 100 firefighters and two aircraft hours to control. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left at all. Photos and relics, treasures, photos of kids, travel, tools of the trade, everything (is gone),\u201d he said. Fire weather warnings have been issued in five states as unseasonably hot conditions are expected across Australia\u2019s eastern seaboard. The mercury is tipped to climb to 30C and beyond in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Hobart and Canberra. More hot and windy weather was predicted for Victoria with fire bans are in force until midnight affecting metropolitan Melbourne and the regional centres of Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo, Seymour, Mildura, Swan Hill, Shepparton, Warrnambool, Hamilton, Horsham, Wimmera and Mallee districts. Most of NSW is on high fire alert, with temperatures set to reach into the mid-30s. The Bureau of Meteorology is predicting the mercury to hit 38C at Parramatta for the second consecutive day on Tuesday but those at Bondi Beach can expect a more mellow maximum of 27C. Fires are burning at Cessnock in the Hunter region, Clarence Valley in the Northern Rivers region and Wakool in the Riverina\u2019s west. There are 24 bush, grass and scrub fires across NSW, of which 10 remain uncontained, an RFS spokesperson said on Tuesday. \u201cNone of those are close to homes or infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cFires will start easily and spread quickly. So preparation is critical now.\u201d While temperatures are \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than Sydney\u2019s October average of 22C they haven\u2019t broken any records. Light winds will pick up on Tuesday afternoon leading to a reprieve on Wednesday when temperatures in Sydney are set to fall to a maximum 23C. The rural fire services commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, says NSW will experience extremely low humidity and winds reaching up to 80km/h. \u201cSoutheastern Australia is shaping up for an above normal fire season this year,\u201d Fitzsimmons told Nine Network on Tuesday. \u201cWe need people to be vigilant and we need people to be careful.\u201d Queensland is also on high alert, after three significant fires on Monday at Wivenhoe Pocket, west of Brisbane, North Gregory, southwest of Bundaberg, and Bluewater, northwest of Townsville. Fire crews are closely monitoring those blazes on Tuesday but say there are currently no threats to homes. There were a total of 60 blazes across Queensland over the weekend, including one that damaged a home and destroyed equipment at Cape Cleveland near Townsville. \u201cWe\u2019re now back to 12 going fires, which we\u2019ll be containing and monitoring today,\u201d the Queensland fire and emergency services commissioner Mike Wassing said. \u201cThose hinterland and interface areas around the whole of the coastal fringe are certainly at great risk in Queensland. Inland areas will also have fires but due to the drought conditions, there\u2019s less fuel this year.\u201d In Tasmania, more than 20 bushfires continue to burn as the state braces for high-risk conditions including winds of up to 100km/h. Temperatures are forecast to hit 32C on Tuesday, but the Bureau of Meteorology isn\u2019t ruling out snowfall for parts of the state within the next 24 hours. \u201cIn and around the Hobart area that maximum temperature will occur early afternoon,\u201d forecaster Alex Melitsis said on Tuesday. \u201cThen we can expect to see a vigorous cold front come through by early evening and there is even the chance of snow later on high peaks including (Hobart\u2019s) Mount Wellington.\u201d Tasmania\u2019s southeast and midlands regions are among the areas of greatest concern with crews already fighting remote fires near Orford, Osterley and at Tea Tree. The Tasmania fire service chief, Gavin Freeman, says it\u2019s important the blazes are quickly controlled. \u201cWe have strike teams of firefighters pre-established and the same with aircraft and machinery; they\u2019ll be on standby and prepositioned in the hot spots,\u201d he said. \u201cOur focus will be weight of attack ... putting a lot of resources on to fires when they start, should they start.\u201d In South Australia, a burn-off at Sleaford designed to control invasive weeds, continues to burn near Port Lincoln on the state\u2019s Eyre Peninsula. The blaze was sparked almost a week ago and flared up again on Monday as temperatures reached 35.6C in Adelaide while at Port Lincoln it was a hotter 37.2C. Authorities have defended the decision to go ahead with a controlled burn, saying it was necessary despite Monday\u2019s hot conditions. The country fire authority assistant chief officer, Rob Sandford, said on FIVEaa radio: \u201cThis work does need to be undertaken to reduce the fuel load to lessen the impact (of potential fires).\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
