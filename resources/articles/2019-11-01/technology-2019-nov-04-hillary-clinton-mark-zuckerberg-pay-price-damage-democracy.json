Speaking in New York at a screening of The Great Hack, a Netflix documentary about the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate cited the threat to upcoming elections in both the US and UK as she made the damning remarks about Facebook\u2019s decision to allow politicians to lie in adverts posted to its platform. Her intervention comes amid speculation she may mount a third bid for the presidency. She said it was inevitable that false information on Facebook would have an impact on elections \u201cbecause propaganda works\u201d. In 2016, she said fake news on Facebook that Pope Francis had endorsed her opponent, Donald Trump, \u201creally did have an impact\u201d and predicted \u201cit\u2019s only going to be more powerful going forward because it is more well tested. They know what they were successful at.\u201d She added: \u201cAnd we are getting warning signals all the time about what is happening right now and how it is likely to affect our next election.\u201d Cambridge Analytica used illegally harvested Facebook profiles to target voters in the US election but Clinton said this was just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d in terms of the challenges facing democracy. Nonetheless her harshest remarks were reserved for Facebook. \u201cWhen Facebook is the principal news source for more than half of the American people, and the only source of news that most of them pay any attention to, and if it announces that it has no responsibility for the airing of false ads \u2026 how are you supposed to get accurate information about anything, let alone candidates running for office?\u201d Asked if she thought there was any connection between the closed-door meeting Zuckerberg had with Donald Trump at the White House and the subsequent decision by Facebook to change its policy around factchecking \u201cfalse, deceptive or deliberately misleading content\u201d by politicians, she said she couldn\u2019t \u201cdraw any conclusions about closed-door meetings, not only with Trump but with Tucker Carlson [of Fox News] and with [rightwing website] Breitbart and with many others that have been going on at Facebook quarters\u201d. But she went on to say: \u201cIf I were of a conspiratorial mindset, I might suggest that there seems to be some connection.\u201d Clinton said she believed we were seeing \u201ca war on truth\u201d in which the \u201cmanipulation of information\u201d served to further the interests of a set of \u201cincredibly wealthy people who believe they can do whatever they want to do\u201d. She also drew attention to the connections between Brexit and the Trump campaign that she said she had not been aware of at the time. She had been \u201csomewhat taken aback\u201d by the Brexit result, she said, but \u201cI didn\u2019t, at that time, see the direct connection. I didn\u2019t know about all the involvement of the same players in Brexit, the same players in our election.\u201d She said The Great Hack had been \u201ca difficult film for me to watch\u201d but also \u201cso true to my own understanding of what had happened\u201d. She said people needed to see the film because \u201cstill to this day there is a sense of disbelief about a lot of what has happened\u201d. The documentary, directed by Karim Amer and Jehane Noujaim, examined the use of data by Cambridge Analytica by the Trump campaign to target \u201cpersuadables\u201d or floating voters and how the Russian government used Facebook\u2019s platform to subvert Clinton\u2019s campaign. Clinton described how, when the first reports started coming in of Russian involvement, her team had tried to raise the issue but it had been impossible to get anyone to take it seriously. \u201cWhen the Russians started dumping emails out around our convention and my campaign went out and tried to talk about that on television they were basically laughed at. It was like: \u2018Oh yeah, right, now she\u2019s going to blame the Russians.\u2019\u201d She pointed out that it had been proved that the Russian government, as well as stealing emails, had also stolen her campaign\u2019s voter data. \u201cAnd then you find out that Paul Manafort is giving polling data to a Russian who has obvious ties with Russian intelligence. \u201cAnd you piece all this together and you can\u2019t make it up. And because it\u2019s hard to make up, it\u2019s hard for people to believe because it\u2019s so far out there.\u201d The situation only seemed to have become worse, she said. \u201cEveryone knows it\u2019s still going on and it will be that much harder to combat.\u201d And she said the amount of money going into the 2020 Trump campaign combined with exhaustive testing had already put it streets ahead of her fellow Democrats."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
