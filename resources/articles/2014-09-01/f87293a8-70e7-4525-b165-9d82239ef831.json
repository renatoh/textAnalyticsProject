The England winger suffered the long-term problem in the FA Cup victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 4 January and he said he would be out for a minimum of nine months. The 25-year-old says he will not be back for the Premier League derby against Tottenham at the Emirates on 27 September but he is happy to report that he is talking in terms of \u201cweeks rather than months\u201d for his comeback. The hope is that he will be fully fit after the international break in the middle of next month. Walcott has sought the silver lining to the injury that ruled him out of Arsenal\u2019s FA Cup final victory over Hull City at the end of last season and England\u2019s World Cup campaign in Brazil. He has worked on building the strength in his legs as never before and he feels he is primed to bolster an attack that now features the pace of the summer signings Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Danny Welbeck. \u201cI hope to be quicker, definitely,\u201d Walcott said, speaking at Sportwaves, a charity exhibition and auction for the national charity, Willow. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at these injuries as a bit of a blessing at times. I was able to be there for the birth of my son, Finley [in April] and, also, I\u2019ve never had the opportunity to work on the strength in my legs. With that, I think I should be quicker and stronger.\u201d Walcott has, for several years, been the fastest player at Arsenal, having beaten Thierry Henry\u2019s record over 40 metres. He said that the young right-back H\u00e9ctor Bellerin had recently surpassed him. \u201cHector is claiming it by one hundredth of a second, with wind assistance,\u201d Walcott said, jokingly. \u201cThat was a couple of weeks ago.\u201d He intends to reclaim the bragging rights when he returns to sprinting, which will be the final phase of his rehabilitation. \u201cI\u2019m all about positive thinking,\u201d Walcott said. \u201cThe injury was always going to take nine months. I feel good within myself. \u201cI\u2019ve got a thing for legs now. I keep looking at legs! My legs have bulked up and I see a different side to legs. It\u2019s a bit weird. When you have the operation, your legs are different because you losea lot of muscle but it changes as the time passes, so you feel it\u2019s going to work because you feel fitter and stronger. \u201cI haven\u2019t put a date on my comeback. There were rumours of the Spurs game, which is definitely not going to happen. I\u2019ll definitely be back for the derby in February. It\u2019s weeks rather than months now, which is a nice feeling.\u201d Walcott has felt the excitement at Arsenal that has built after Ars\u00e8ne Wenger broke his spending record for a transfer window. The most eye-catching additions have been those of S\u00e1nchez and Welbeck, who have joined for a combined \u00a347m. \u201cI hope we\u2019ll have the fastest forward line in the Premier League,\u201d Walcott said. \u201cWe can build on the FA Cup win and attract these great players to the club. It will hopefully put Arsenal where we should be \u2013 winning trophies. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive buzz around the club. Alexis has settled in very quickly and Danny is a good guy, who I know from England. It has been well-documented over the years that we haven\u2019t spent as much but Arsenal are doing it in the right way. We are spending it wisely. The boss knows what he is doing. He also likes to work with young players, not just bring in expensive players for the sake of it.\u201d Theo Walcott features in the Sportwaves exhibition and auction, raising funds for Willow.
