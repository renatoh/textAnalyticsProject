Life in lockdown can fuel family tensions, sour friendships and drive a wedge between new romantic partners who have opted to self-isolate together. Help is on hand, however. A former Nasa astronaut, Jay Buckey, has launched an online self-help toolkit aimed at replicating the kind of training designed to help astronauts cope with confinement in small spaces for extended periods. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging to be isolated with a small group of people and to not be able to get away,\u201d said Buckey, who flew on a 16-day Space Shuttle Columbia mission that orbited the Earth 256 times. \u201cOuter space and your own living room might be drastically different physically, but emotionally the stressors can be the same.\u201d The online training, called the Dartmouth Path Program, was developed to determine how the space programme can manage pressures brought on by long-duration spaceflight. It is already being tested in extreme environments such as research stations in Antarctica, but since social distancing restrictions came into force it has been made freely available to the public online. It includes training on conflict resolution, mood management and self-assessment tools to be able to monitor signs of anxiety and stress. For stress, the programme prompts the participant to consider whether they could be over-reacting, catastrophising or making judgments that don\u2019t fit the evidence. Focused breathing and muscle relaxation techniques are outlined for when you are feeling anxious or angry. The training also covers depression, which can set in when you feel restricted and unable to do the things that normally boost your mood, according to Buckey, who is now a professor of medicine at Dartmouth College. The programme encourages people to select problems and find aspects they can improve or solve and to brainstorm positive steps they can take. It encourages people to think about a single enjoyable activity that is possible to do each day. \u201cIf you focus constantly on what you can\u2019t do or things you want to do or that you\u2019re isolated, that\u2019s not good for mood,\u201d said Buckey. Keeping a balance between group time and private time is crucial, he said. \u201cYou need to allow people their privacy but not to allow them to become isolated and separated from a group,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone\u2019s spending all their time in their room with their door closed, that\u2019s not great. Forcing people to take part in group activities that they\u2019re just not into \u2013 that\u2019s not good either.\u201d According to Buckey, Nasa and other agencies now give psychological training to avoid conflict between crew members, but the problem blighted some missions in the past. The Russian cosmonaut Valentin Lebvedev, who documented his 211-day stay onboard the Space Station Salyut 7 with Anatoly Berezovoy, wrote: \u201cWe don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with us. We silently walk by each other, feeling offended. We have to find some way to make things better.\u201d Scientists on Antarctic missions have also struggled with isolation, Buckey said, pointing to the notes of Jean Rivolier, a French psychologist and chief doctor on several Antarctic expeditions, describing the dismal morale of one party in the 1990s. \u201cOne subject returned early to Sydney on psychological grounds, because he was homesick for his family and he became progressively more depressed,\u201d Rivolier wrote. \u201cWhen the others returned they were humourless, tired, despondent and resentful. None had found the Antarctic experience to be enjoyable, not so much from any rigours of the climate, terrain or personal hardships as from inconsiderate and selfish behaviour.\u201d Pete Davis, an oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, said the uncertain length of missions to the south pole, due to weather considerations, was challenging. The \u201cworst thing to do\u201d, he said, was to focus on when isolation would end. \u201cThe best thing to avoid is what\u2019s going to happen in three months time when you\u2019ve only just started,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you can control is what\u2019s going to happen today or tomorrow.\u201d Davis, who returned from a three-month Antarctic mission in February only to be plunged back into confinement at home, advised that simple, considerate gestures could help ensure harmony. \u201cIn Antarctica, full-blown conflict doesn\u2019t tend to happen, but the small niggle of \u2018that\u2019s so annoying\u2019 does,\u201d he said. \u201cJust things like if you\u2019re going to make a cup of tea, make sure you ask everyone as well. It\u2019s such a minor thing but it can get under people\u2019s skin.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
