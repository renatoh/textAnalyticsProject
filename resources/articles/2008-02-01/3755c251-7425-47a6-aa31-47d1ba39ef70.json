McCain's lie misrepresents an Obama foreign policy address made in August where he said: I understand that President Musharraf has his own challenges. But let me make this clear. There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans. They are plotting to strike again. It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al Qaeda leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will. Now McCain could be forgiven if this was all Obama had said, to \"act\" is a broad term indeed. Yet as Chait makes plain, McCain forgot to provide further context from Obama's speech. Here's Obama in more specificity: I will not hesitate to use military force to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to America. This requires a broader set of capabilities, as outlined in the Army and Marine Corps's new counter-insurgency manual. I will ensure that our military becomes more stealth, agile, and lethal in its ability to capture or kill terrorists. We need to recruit, train, and equip our armed forces to better target terrorists, and to help foreign militaries to do the same. Obama isn't advocating carpet-bombing Pakistan to kill jihadists here, he's talking about surgical Special Forces' missions. Which misses the point anyway, because as Chait persuasively argues, McCain isn't interested in an honest debate about the merits of going unilateral into Pakistan after al Qaeda and fellow travelers: \"He's just interested in lying about what Obama said in order to portray him as a foreign policy novice.\" McCain, of course, has fashioned the myth that he's above politics. What this shows is that a McCain-Obama contest might not be the model of civility I had hoped for and that McCain may not be above unleashing the Republican smear machine against Barack Obama."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
