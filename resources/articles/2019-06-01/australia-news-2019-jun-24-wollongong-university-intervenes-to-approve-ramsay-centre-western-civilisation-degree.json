On Monday the university announced its top governing body had taken the unusual step of intervening to approve the degree, despite it never being considered by its academic senate. The university chancellor, Jillian Broadbent, said in a statement that the council had \u201cfull respect for the university\u2019s academic process\u201d but had decided to intervene in order to \u201cremove any uncertainty about its commencement at UOW next year\u201d. \u201cBy approving the degree the council has acted in the best interests of the university,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will enable progress to continue despite any continuing legal challenge to the vice-chancellor\u2019s earlier approval decision.\u201d The Ramsay Centre\u2019s western civilisation degree was the brainchild of the late Paul Ramsay, a healthcare mogul who established the centre with a $3.3bn bequest. The degree has proved enormously controversial at other universities. The Australian National University pulled out of a deal with the centre over concerns about academic freedom, and at the University of Sydney some academics accused the degree of \u201cembodying a kind of academic racism\u201d and said adopting it risked turning the university into an \u201cintellectual backwater\u201d. Much of the criticism of the degree spurred from an article by former prime minister Tony Abbott (a Ramsay Centre board member) in the conservative publication Quadrant, stating that the centre was \u201cnot merely about western civilisation but in favour of it\u201d. The latest decision comes after the National Tertiary Education Union announced in April that it was launching action in the New South Wales supreme court in a bid to stop the degree\u2019s rollout. The NTEU\u2019s challenge centred on Wollongong vice-chancellor Paul Wellings\u2019 decision to fast track the formal approval of the degree, which meant it was not considered and approved \u2013 as usually occurs \u2013 by the university\u2019s academic senate. But under UOW\u2019s governing laws the council has broad authority to \u201cact in all matters concerning the university\u201d, and to \u201cprovide such courses, and confer such degrees \u2026 as it thinks fit\u201d, and its intervention is a clear attempt to force the union to back down. In her statement, Broadbent, who chairs the council, \u201cinvited\u201d the NTEU to withdraw its court challenge. But the NTEU national president, Alison Barnes, said the decision was \u201canother example of the university not following its normal procedures in approving new courses\u201d, and that the union would now consider its next steps. \u201cThe NTEU\u2019s case centres around the university\u2019s bypassing of the normal academic governance processes,\u201d she said. \u201cUniversities\u2019 internal academic governance processes play a vital role in quality control and are fundamental to ensuring academic integrity and quality. \u201cThe university\u2019s latest step is again another example of the university not following its normal processes, at the expense of the academic governance. The NTEU is again disappointed at UOW\u2019s disregard for its academic staff and the broader university community.\u201d When UOW announced the deal with the Ramsay Centre in December, it came as a shock to many in the university\u2019s humanities department. Under the terms of the deal announced, Ramsay Centre staff would sit on academic and scholarship selection committees, but will not chair the committees or have a majority vote. On Monday Broadbent said the UOW council had acted to end uncertainty around the delivery of the degree. \u201cThe council was mindful of the tight timeframes involved in preparing to begin teaching the degree in 2020 and the potential impact of any uncertainty regarding the course\u2019s approval status,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
