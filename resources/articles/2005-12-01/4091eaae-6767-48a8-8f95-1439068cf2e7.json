By trading idealism for pragmatism they have enhanced their chances of survival in the Premiership and yesterday they exploited their main advantage over the Tigers, experience. Leicester fielded only three of the side which started their Heineken Cup victory over the Ospreys last week and they left Martin Corry, Graham Rowntree and Andy Goode out completely. Consequently they lacked direction throughout. Bristol, in contrast, fielded a tight five whose average age was a few weeks under 35 and such was their control of the game that, while the Tigers used all their replacements, the home side used none. It is the season for Dad's Army reruns and Leicester certainly did not like it up them. They were so outplayed in the opening half that five Jason Strange penalties marked a meagre return for Bristol. There was a 15-minute spell in the second quarter when the hosts laid siege to the Tigers' try-line but Bristol's resource lay in winning and maintaining the ball rather than using it and, apart from one clever move from a scrum which nearly resulted in a try, the Leicester defence was overworked rather than overstretched. Leicester proved more inventive on the few occasions they had the ball, with Sam Vesty and Dan Hipkiss threatening. However, they never looked like repeating their victory at the Ospreys, where they absorbed pressure to the point the game appeared to be beyond them only to strike when their opponents relaxed. The Tigers lost their one experienced back when Daryl Gibson went off in the first half with a dislocated shoulder that may put him out for the rest of the season. The match was, in its way, a condemnation of the play-off season. With the teams which have finished at the top of the Premiership table yet to be crowned champions in the three years of the play-offs, momentum is everything. League defeats are not as costly as they used to be and Wasps have exploited the system the most, gaining momentum in the second half of seasons. Defeat may have reduced Leicester's chances of finishing at the top of the table in May but it did little to dent their play-off ambitions. Bristol's game plan here was simple: play for position and look to grind down opponents who, even with the return of the prop Julian White from suspension, were lacking in know-how. White took only three minutes to earn a talking-to from the referee Dean Richards, a Berkshire official taking charge of his first Premiership match rather than Leicester's former captain and coach. He was a late replacement for Tony Spreadbury, who was involved in a road accident on the way to the ground, and the scrum was hotly contested all afternoon, contributing significantly to the penalty tally of 34. The closest the game came to producing a try was when the Bristol prop Dave Hilton was held up on the line in the first half. Leicester's threat came on the counter-attack. Hipkiss was brought into the centre to cover for Gibson and adopted good lines of attack, working well with Vesty, but neither Ross Broadfoot nor Ian Humphreys looked comfortable at outside-half while the three-quarters Seru Rabeni and Tom Varndell were too easily hustled into mistakes. Bristol failed to score in the second half despite the ground made by their excellent No8 Dan Ward-Smith. Their director of rugby Richard Hill admitted he was surprised at how comfortable the victory had been. The Leicester head coach Pat Howard said he had not fielded a weak side, claiming it was better than the one which started against the Ospreys, but his argument was unconvincing. \"I would not say our line-up was a key factor,\" he said. \"Our goal is to be in the top four and that is where we are at the end of the year.\" Bristol: Stortoni; Robinson, Lima, Cox, Lemi; Strange, Perry; Hilton, Regan, Crompton, Winters, Llewellyn, Salter (capt), El Abd, Ward-Smith.
