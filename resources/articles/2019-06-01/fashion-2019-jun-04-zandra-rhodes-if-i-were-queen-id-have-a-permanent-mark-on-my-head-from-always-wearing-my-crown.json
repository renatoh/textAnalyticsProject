I love it because I wore it to a very memorable event during a very memorable period of my life. I was experimenting more. There\u2019s a boned bodice top and a crinoline underneath the gold pleated skirt. Over the crinoline are two swirled panniers, attached to a sash. This picture was taken at the grand opening of the Barbican Centre in 1982 \u2013 a new, alternative arts space with cinemas in a part of London that needed revitalising. It was opened by the Queen. I remember that she didn\u2019t wear a crown, although I think she should have done because it was an important occasion. If I were the Queen, I\u2019d have a permanent mark on my head from always wearing my crown! The designer David Sassoon (left) saved this picture for many years, which is wonderful. We went together and I think we were the most dressed-up couple. I always like to dress up, because you give things a sense of occasion and make it memorable. You don\u2019t just say: \u201cHere\u2019s the event, take it or leave it.\u201d I lent this outfit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for a new exhibition \u2013 but I would definitely still wear it. There\u2019s nothing better than wearing clothes from your own collection because then you can find out if you\u2019ve done anything wrong. If you put something on and it keeps riding up or doesn\u2019t sit in the right place, then it\u2019s not the dress\u2019s fault, it\u2019s the designer\u2019s. I only ever wear clothes I have designed. If I wear something that is practical but not one of my designs, then I adapt it. So at the moment, I\u2019m wearing pink dungarees to work in, but I\u2019ve printed all over them. If you\u2019re a designer and you\u2019re not wearing your own product, then what do you believe in? What are you selling? Dame Zandra Rhodes is the newest lifetime patron of Graduate fashion week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
