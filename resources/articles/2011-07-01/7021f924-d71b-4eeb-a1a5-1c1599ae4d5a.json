While tears are the accepted currency of public performance these days, from sport to the closure of newspapers, there was no pre-meditation in Murray's very moving reaction to winning a Davis Cup tie in the land of his birth on Sunday. It came from the heart so suddenly and with such force it almost ripped his shaggy head off. As he retreated to his chair on unsteady legs, he dropped his head in his hands, oblivious, it seemed, to the comforting pat on the back from Leon Smith, his cup captain and old friend, and sobbed. Murray was in the loneliest and happiest of places. Only he knew the feeling of joy swirling alongside the release of tension and anxiety that comes with completing a difficult assignment under the scrutiny of strangers. What can he have been thinking as we watched: Do I look ridiculous? Did they like my tennis today? Will they believe me now when I say I really do want to play for my country? Are there any Percy Pigs in my bag? It is the curse of talent that individuals who have it \u2013 and who therefore eventually are led to display those gifts in front of a paying audience demanding nothing less than excellence and success \u2013 often are emotionally ill-suited to the nerve-shredding demands of the task. How many potential champions have balked at the challenge and found an excuse to turn away from it, preferring to never know rather than test themselves and fall short? \"Don't die wondering,\" is the appropriate cliche, but many do. Murray didn't turn away. He trusted his talent from the day he picked up a racket. What followed was a growing realisation that tennis was going to define him and that every time he went on court he would have to prove how good he was \u2013 to himself. That determination to be the best on his own terms became his shield. If he didn't win Wimbledon, he at least tried harder than anyone else; he could not be fitter, nor more committed. But he had to be selfish about it. He was, like a fighter in the ring, on his own. If he sacked his coaches, it was not because he was a petulant brat but a perfectionist. Murray is probably the most misunderstood sporting celebrity in the country, portrayed in conversations and, it has to be said, the media as permanently miserable. An essentially shy person who has sometimes struggled to satisfy the public's expectations, Murray is aware of what is an unreasonable obligation to be perfect in every way. He even tries to address it, because he wants to please. He is also as tough as nails, whatever the lachrymose breakdown at the Braehead Arena on Sunday might have suggested, and his commitment in pursuing his aim of getting to the top in an era that entertains the two greatest players of all time, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, is total. Nobody should pretend to completely understand Andy Murray, except maybe his mother, Judy, who was also near tears after he had destroyed Gilles Muller of Luxembourg in straight sets. But it is surely time to give him space, to let him be himself. If he is comfortable with who he is and what we think of him, he might just win that Wimbledon title. Some people, of course, will not be convinced. If you want evidence of how much he is loved where he was born, this tweet from Judy might convince even the saddos of the Anyone But Murray brigade: \"Amazing 100 year old lady went thru to Braehead on the Dunblane bus to watch Andy on Friday. How good is that?\" It's worth repeating his own description of Sunday's quite moving experience: \"I enjoy playing for my country, and it is a different feeling. I felt like I was myself on the court. I was hungry, I was intense, I was getting annoyed at the things I should be getting annoyed at, the things that get me fired up. That's me. That's what I've always been like and I need to make sure I don't lose that.\" Modric neatly articulates football's glaring hypocrisy The dash from one suitor to another by players is a familiar thread in the fabric of football. But few have articulated more succinctly the hypocrisy of the ritual than Luka Modric in trying to break free of the embrace of Tottenham Hotspur to be newly-loved by Chelsea. The Croatian midfielder was, he said, \"disappointed\" with the way Spurs chairman Daniel Levy spoke to him when they met for 40 minutes to discuss what would appeal to anyone in normal society as working conditions of considerable generosity. \"He threatened me that if I don't say [to the media] that I want to stay, I will be on the reserves or maybe the bench,\" he said. \"His threat and blackmailing convinced me that I am right and that I want to go away. I understand the club, but I want Levy to understand me. I didn't think that he could be so rude. Levy was very cold and very arrogant.\" The concepts of respect and loyalty in football are such distant memories it invites ridicule for indulging in nostalgia to even bring the subject up. Cynicism and greed are the bywords of the modern game \u2013 on both sides. In these days of rampant deregulation in the workplace, contracts of employment offer the flimsiest of protection to workers, but footballers earning whatever obscene sum Modric pockets each week are seriously out of touch if they expect sympathy for reacting to the latest whim of their agents by seeking a move on the pretence of winning trophies. Modric claims he wants a chance to \"play in a stronger team that fights for the title and plays in the biggest stadiums in Europe\". And no doubt if Chelsea do not satisfy his lust for glory he will be in similar talks with Roman Abramovich before long and will then complain to journalists that the chairman is \"very cold and very arrogant\". He is not so naive as to think the regime at Chelsea is any different from the one at Tottenham. He knows that all that separates the clubs are several miles of traffic jams and a good deal of available cash for him to plunder. How different it was at White Hart Lane 50 years ago. In the year of the Double, Spurs used just 17 players in all competitions. In the programme notes (actually a single slip of paper) for the celebration of that achievement, against West Bromwich Albion on 29 April, 1961, the manager Bill Nicholson wrote with unadorned sincerity, \"They are a credit to Tottenham Hotspur Football Club and I thank them for all their efforts.\" It's enough to make you weep. Khan's tweeted promise \"I've just made a promise in life. Something I'll always stick to. 01:36am Monday July 11th 2011. Good night.\" What could Amir Khan be tweeting about in the small hours of the morning in Los Angeles? And does his trainer Freddie Roach know he is up at that time when he should be resting ahead of his world title fight against Zab Judah in Las Vegas on 23 July? He does now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
