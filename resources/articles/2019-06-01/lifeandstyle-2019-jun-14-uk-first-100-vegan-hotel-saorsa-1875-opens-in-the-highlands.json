Dishes include watermelon sashimi, rainbow polenta gnocchi and \u2013 perhaps inevitably, since this establishment is in the Scottish Highlands \u2013 his own reinterpretation of haggis. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to make a meringue using the cooking water of chickpeas, or a panna cotta with a kind of seaweed,\u201d says Sordi, who re-trained as a chef after becoming a vegetarian, and has seldom cooked meat. \u201cBut it\u2019s not about recreating something we are missing. This is getting the best from what is in nature.\u201d The number of Britons eating a wholly plant-based diet quadrupled between 2014 and 2018 to 600,000, or 1.16% of the population. Glasgow was voted the most vegan-friendly city in the UK, and the surge in \u201cgreen getaways\u201d has become one of Visit Scotland\u2019s key trends for 2019. \u201cScotland has an amazing vegan scene in Glasgow, and in Edinburgh,\u201d said Jack McLaren-Stewart, who has launched this family project in Pitlochry, Perthshire, with his business partner and mother, Sandra. Both are long-term vegetarians who became vegan about five years ago. He said: \u201cBut as you start to come into the Highlands it becomes progressively hard to be vegan. At best you get one vegetarian option on a menu. This is about giving people the opportunity to come to a beautiful place and not feel like they have to compromise at all.\u201d Everything at Saorsa 1875 is vegan: from the liqueurs at the hotel bar to upcycled lounge furniture and the cleaning products. Heating comes via newly fitted electric radiators from the 100% renewable Ecotricity. This has demanded an investigative approach to food and furnishing. Wines might appear vegan but many are filtered using isinglass, from the swim bladder of fish. Plenty of duvets are made without feathers nowadays, but their microfibres may have added wool and sourcing vegan slug repellant remains a challenge. What is most evident from a visit to the premises is how unobtrusive these changes are. Upstairs in the 11 guest bedrooms, where Sandra McLaren-Stewart\u2019s interior design training has come to the fore, there is the same statement wallpaper, voluminous bedding and extravagant throws one might expect in any stylish boutique hotel, except that here the wools, silks and leather have been replaced with linen, cotton, velvet and manmade fibres. She said: \u201cPeople see our lifestyle choice as abstinent. We\u2019re not partaking fully in life because we\u2019re having to leave all these things off the menu, all these things you can\u2019t enjoy. We wanted to create some place to say \u2018you can\u2019. Even with clothes, you can buy non-leather shoes, or Fairtrade cotton, there\u2019s a huge push.\u201d While growing awareness of how animal agriculture might effect the climate emergency is prompting more and more of us to consider plant-based alternatives, it\u2019s fair to say that veganism continues to attract some residual sneering . Witness William Sitwell, who quit as the editor of Waitrose Food magazine after an email exchange in which he joked about\u201ckilling vegans\u201d. \u201cI think it forces people to question their own choices and sometimes that makes them uncomfortable,\u201d said Sandra diplomatically. Interest in veganism from the hospitality and tourism sector has only really kicked off in the UK in the past two years, said Dominika Piasecka, a spokesperson for the Vegan Society. \u201cWe are getting a lot of queries from restaurants. They need to see that vegan options are selling, and often they don\u2019t know how to cook a decent vegan dish. So far, it\u2019s mainly in the cities and large towns but other places are slowly catching up. \u201cKnowing that no animal had to suffer for the hotel equipment or cosmetics gives vegans peace of mind, and supporting ethical businesses makes their holiday that much more enjoyable.\u201d The potatoes in the hotel vegetable patch are thriving, and a selection of apple and cherry saplings are taking root. Most fruit and vegetables are sourced locally, said Jack \u2013 \u201calthough Perthshire is not exactly known for its lemons\u201d \u2013 with coffee from Aberfeldy and bread from a bakery in Crieff. He said he was keen to attract the \u201cplant-curious\u201d as well as committed vegans and vegetarians. \u201cWhen you become vegan and throw yourself into the movement you discover it is really vibrant and there are so many people doing these amazing innovative things. \u201cWe really wanted to have a place that showcased that, and that other people can come to. We don\u2019t have a doorman checking if you\u2019re vegan or you\u2019re not coming in. But maybe coming with your partner who is not vegan, or a couple who think we\u2019ve heard so much about it let\u2019s give it a try.\u201d The family are both delighted and a little overwhelmed by the initial reception to their all-vegan venture, with the first weekend fully booked. \u201cThe feedback has been amazing,\u201d said Jack. \u201cWe\u2019ve been bombarded with messages of support from all over the world. It\u2019s a really nice validation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
