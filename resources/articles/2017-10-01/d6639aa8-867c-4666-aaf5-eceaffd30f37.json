His 12th album contains semi-acoustic strumming, hurtling shoegaze and shimmering Italian house, but mostly settles on a blissful, electronic pop sound that\u2019s often reminiscent of a hazier, more beatific Temptation-era New Order. Old analogue drum machines tick, synthesisers soar and Peter Hook-type basslines twang, most effectively on the sublime, memorably titled Tinseltown Swimming in Blood. As ever, Bejar\u2019s lyrics \u2013 delivered as conversational narratives \u2013 seem to hail from a parallel universe. Urinating brides nestle up against \u201cdear young revolutionary capitalists\u201d, with Saw You at the Hospital\u2019s imagery particularly vivid (\u201cYour eyes were clearly insane, your robes undone\u201d). Named after the original title of Suede\u2019s The Wild Ones, Ken isn\u2019t quite as cohesive as 2011\u2019s outstanding breakthrough, Kaputt, but makes another fine addition to the canon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
