IDC pegged the total number sold at 84.41m, marking a growth of 2.6%, while Gartner had a slightly higher total but smaller growth, of 85.2m shipped for a 2.3% increase. The two companies use slightly different estimates for shipments. Neither counts tablets such as the iPad as a PC in its figures. Netbook sales continued to fall, they said, and consumers and businesses in the US and western Europe are holding off buying new PCs as budgets are squeezed. But in Asia sales are booming, notably in India and China, which saw growth of around 10%. Latin America also saw strong growth. Both companies agreed that in the three months from April the largest vendors worldwide were HP, Dell, Lenovo, Acer and Asus, with HP selling around 15m machines, Dell 10.6m, Lenovo 10.2m, Acer 9.3m and Asus 4.4m. But the key element was a fall in sales in both the US and Europe. For the US, IDC saw a 4.2% decline year-on-year, although the 17.8m shipped are up \"substantially\" from the first quarter of 2011, when worldwide sales dipped by 3.1% year-on-year. Gartner put the US figure at 16.9m, a 5.6% fall year-on-year. Gartner put the figure for the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region at 23m units, a 4.8% decline year-on-year. \"Given the hype around media tablets such as the iPad, retailers were very conservative in placing orders for PCs. Instead, they wanted to secure space for media tablets. Some PC vendors had to lower their inventory through promotions, while others slimmed their product lines at retailers,\" said Mikako Kitagawa, Gartner's principal analyst. \"After strong growth in shipments of consumer PCs for four years, driven by strong demand for mini-notebooks and low-priced consumer notebooks, the market is shifting to modest, but steady growth. The slow overall growth indicates that the PC market is still in a period of adjustment, which began in the second half of 2010.\" IDC says that the US market is \"still downcast from a combination of exuberant consumption a year ago and a tenuous economic recovery\", while the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region contracted as well due to high levels of inventory - and IDC added that it is seeing \"budget cannibalization from media tablets and smartphones [which] continued to contribute to weak consumer demand and slow stock depletion.\" HP and Dell grew roughly in line with the market, while both companies said Lenovo grew sales by 23%. Acer - which has recently had a destabilising management reshuffle, and discovered issues with inventory in Europe, fell to fourth place overall, shipping just over 9m PCs. Asus was fifth with 4.4m shipments, the companies said. So far the total number of PCs shipped worldwide this year is the same as at this point in 2010. IDC revised its forecast in June to suggest that the total number of PCs shipped this year will grow only 4.2% this year, having in February suggested a figure of 7.1%. Gartner in March lowered its forecast to an overall 10.5% growth, and then in June cut it again to 9.3%. Rajani Singh, research analyst with IDC's United States Quarterly PC Tracker said in a statement: \"The U.S. PC market continued to contract in the second quarter of 2011 largely as a result of three factors. The first is an ongoing contraction in the Mini Notebook (Netbook) market and related inventories. The second is the impact of 2Q10's difficult-to-sustain 12% growth. And third, demand has softened as corporate buyers continue to focus on increasing share of their IT budget in new IT solutions such as cloud and virtualization, and consumer interest shifts to media tablets... Given the weakness of sales in] the second half of 2010, we expect a better market environment in the second half of 2011 with mid-single digit growth rates in the third quarter's back to school and fourth quarter's holiday season.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
