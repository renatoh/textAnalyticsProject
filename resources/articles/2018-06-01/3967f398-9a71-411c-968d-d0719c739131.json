The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said she had traveled to the council\u2019s headquarters in Geneva a year ago to call for reforms, to no avail. \u201cRegrettably it is now clear that our call for reform was not heeded,\u201d Haley told reporters at the state department. \u201cHuman rights abusers continue to serve on, and be elected to, the council.\u201d She added: \u201cThe world\u2019s most inhumane regimes continue to escape scrutiny and the council continues politicising and scapegoating of countries with positive human rights records in an attempt to distract from the abusers in their ranks.\u201d \u201cFor too long the human rights council has been a protector of human rights abusers and a cesspool of political bias.\u201d The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, expressed regret about the US withdrawal. The organisation\u2019s top human rights official, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein said in a tweet: \u201cGiven the state of human rights in today\u2019s world, the US should be stepping up, not stepping back.\u201d Haley argued the US had spent a year in pursuit of reforms while the council\u2019s flaws deepened. She pointed to the election of the Democratic Republic of Congo to council membership in the past year, despite the US reform campaign, as proof that the body could not be fixed. She also noted the council had failed to hold a single session on Venezuela, which is a council member, or Iran, despite its ruthless crushing of opposition demonstrations. \u201cWhen a so-called human rights council cannot bring itself to address the massive abuses in Venezuela and Iran, and it welcomes the Democratic Republic of Congo as a new member, the council ceases to be worthy of its name,\u201d the ambassador said. Haley also pointed to the continued existence of \u201cagenda item 7\u201d, a permanent fixture on the schedule, exclusively devoted to the discussion of rights violations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said the US decision to leave was \u201cregrettable\u201d. Johnson, who had called on Monday for agenda item 7 to be reformed, said in a statement: \u201cThe United States\u2019 decision to withdraw from the human rights council is regrettable. \u201cWe\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that the UK wants to see reform of the human rights council, but we are committed to working to strengthen the council from within,\u201d the foreign secretary added. However, Haley criticised countries that expressed concern about the council but remained members, suggesting those countries lacked courage. \u201cAlmost every country we met with agrees with us, in principle and behind closed doors, that the human rights council needs major dramatic, systemic changes. Yet no other country has had the courage to join our fight,\u201d she said. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, appearing alongside Haley, said: \u201cToo many commitments have gone unfulfilled. President Trump wants to move the ball forward. From day one he has called out institutions or countries who say one thing and do another, and that\u2019s precisely the problem at the human rights council.\u201d The Trump administration had been signalling its intention to leave the council for some months, but the announcement came while the US itself is under intense criticism for its own human rights, because of the administration\u2019s policy of forcibly separating young children from their parents when apprehended on the Mexican border. \u201cTrump\u2019s withdrawal is especially disturbing given his persistent praise for despots and dictators with abysmal human rights records, not to mention his administration\u2019s cruel mistreatment of immigrant families seeking asylum,\u201d the Democratic National Committee said in a statement. Advocacy groups accused the US of withdrawing from its global obligations to protect human rights. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal is a sad reflection of its one-dimensional human rights policy: defending Israeli abuses from criticism takes precedence above all else,\u201d Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, said. \u201cThe UN human rights council has played an important role in such countries as North Korea, Syria, Myanmar and South Sudan, but all Trump seems to care about is defending Israel. Like last time when the US government stepped away from the Council for similar reasons, other governments will have to redouble their efforts to ensure the Council addresses the world\u2019s most serious human rights problems.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
