If anyone were betting, it would be 10-11 each of two. Half an hour before the first race at today's three meetings, the Jockey Club's new regulations on the use of mobiles by riders will require every jockey at the track to switch off their phone until either the last race has started, or they have left the course for the day. They have been around for little more than a decade and yet the mobile has swiftly become such an integral part of the modern jockey's busy, multi-tasking lifestyle that dozens of riders have already contributed cash to a fighting fund to explore a legal challenge to the new rules. The Jockey Club accepts that \"the measures are an inconvenience to riders,\" and that \"the working practices of British riders are not easily comparable with foreign-based riders, who are already subject to strict mobile phone rules.\" However, the Club insists too that the new rules are necessary to preserve racing's integrity. The measures are a direct result of the notorious Wright trials, at which the former jockey Graham Bradley admitted passing privileged information from the weighing room to Brian Wright, a suspected cocaine-smuggler, using his mobile phone. The trials, and the publicity, including a BBC Panorama investigation, that followed, led to the formation of the Club's security review group, chaired by Ben Gunn, a former chief policeman. The group's recommendations included restrictions on the use of mobile phones by riders of the sort that the Club is about to enact. Jockeys will not be completely incommunicado. Contact numbers for racecourses have been circulated to allow incoming calls in emergencies, while three Jockey Club mobile phones will also be available for use by riders during the restricted period. Each rider will key in a PIN before dialling, enabling the Club to charge the call to the jockey's personal account at Weatherbys, and at the same time deny mischief-makers the chance to dial the speaking clock in Woollamaloo. Plans to record all calls made on the Jockey Club phones, a particularly contentious idea when the measures were announced, have also been shelved, for the moment at least. Whether this will be enough to head off a legal challenge to the new rules remains to be seen, though. Philip Robinson, who is leading the opposition, says that he has overwhelming support in the weighing room. The riders would like to see a compromise, whereby they switch off their mobiles at the appointed time, but are allowed to use them to make outgoing calls in public view in the weighing room, having first received permission from one of the Club's new Weighing Room security officers. \"If the Jockey Club seriously think anyone is going to use their phone to make mischief in a public place, they have taken leave of their senses,\" Michael Caulfield, of the Jockeys' Association, said yesterday.\"Our proposals will not allow someone to call a jockey and find out what is going to win.\" The Club, though, insists that there will be no more concessions, and that its lawyers believe their measures are legitimate. Portman Square vs Nokia et al could be a fight that goes the full 15 rounds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
