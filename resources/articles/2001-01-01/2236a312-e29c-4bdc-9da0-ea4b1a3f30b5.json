Bristol City, visibly stunned by the endeavour and often composure of their non-league opponents, scored in the fourth minute of injury time to earn a replay - while shattering romantic dreams. Scott Murray's corner came over from the right and in the goalmouth scramble as Kingstonian tried desperately to clear, Tony Thorpe, the home club's leading scorer - but left on the substitute's bench until the 52nd minute - volleyed in. It was a bitter moment for Kingstonian, who from the depths of the Conference have already knocked Southend and Brentford out of the Cup this season. Their football was frequently calm and intelligent and they packed their defence dependably as City searched with nervous energy and increasingly anxiety for the elusive goal. Geoff Chapple, Kingstonian's 55-year-old manager, the 'Godfather' of non-league football, pondered the misery of the way yet another shock conquest was snatched from them. 'They don't come any closer. My players are in tears in the dressing room. But they were magnificent for me and they can be proud of what they achieved, a Cinderella team getting into the last 16. 'It's said that football is the beautiful game. It is also a cruel one. I remember thinking that this could be the dream of all dreams. 'Danny Wilson, City's manager, knew our weaknesses because he'd seen us recently on a bad day. But this was a match when we made a lot of friends. The replay will be at Brentford and my job is to pick the players up.' Chapple has a remarkable record for a man who has never applied for a manager's job in the League. His manner is quiet and persuasive. In 1991 he took Woking to the fourth round; yesterday it was so agonisingly near to being the fifth round with Kingstonian. When his side went ahead with a goal by Phil Wingfield, in his third spell with Kingstonian, in the 57th minute, the occupants of the visitors' dug-out leapt ecstatically into the air as one. When Thorpe netted, seconds from the end, the players and supporters could only look in disbelief. As the final whistle went, the team beat the ground and some sprawled on the surface. Disguising his emotions, Chapple walked on to the pitch to console the players who were given an ovation by the crowd, many of them massively relieved. It was an entertaining game, full of enterprise, decent passing and almost as many errors amid the excitement. And although they had the edge overall in possession, City appeared to be conceding defeat with a defensive nightmare in the second half, which might have gifted Kingstonian two goals instead of one. Louis Carey was at fault with an intended back-pass. Wingfield rounded the keeper and scored with a clever angled shot, which eluded Carey after he had raced back to the line. Minutes before that there was an even better chance for Kingstonian. This time, Mark Duerden, a newcomer from Doncaster, failed to take advantage of a badly organised defence. As expected Kingstonian had started with breezy optimism, eager to demonstrate that they could play an attractive style. Eddie Akuamoah forced a corner and when it came over Mark Harris headed fractionally over to underline ominous traits for the home team. Gradually City steadied down and Brian Tinnion's intuitive touches from midfield emerged. First his perfect pass was screwed wide by Lee Peacock; then Tinnion's own 30-yard drive was tipped on to the bar by the capable Gavin Kelly, a 19-year-old on loan from Spurs and Kingstonian's seventh keeper of the season. Chapple must self-consciously have been thinking of an eighth as Kelly was hurt going for a short back-pass, the worry was that the visitors had no keeper on the bench. In any case, Kelly recovered and remained busy. Geoff Pitcher had figured in almost as much pre-match publicity as his manager. One could see why. He patrolled midfield, passed with unerring accuracy. It's easy to imagine why he maybe tempted away from the build ing trade for a second spell of professional football. One shot of his was saved by Steve Phillips. A determined burst was only foiled by offside, and then his measured free kick was turned away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
