Alan Davies is performing an hour of middlebrow comedy flanked by two towering adverts for cigarettes. His fans will not be disappointed by a set that sees the floppy-haired Essex lad ruminate jauntily on a range of topical issues and revisit popular routines from the past. He is good at what he does - identifying the absurdity in the everyday - and he does it with a certain lolloping charm. But there's nothing in his newish set that will challenge audiences, far less Davies himself. This is stand-up by numbers: it is unusual, if not exactly refreshing, to see a comedian who makes no effort to conceal his act's mechanics. An hour with Davies comes in six- or seven-minute chunks. There's the chunk about the Queen Mum, then the one about spiders' webs. There's the chunk about vasectomies, then another about Jeffrey Archer. This is by-the-book observational stand-up, often very funny and likely to offend only those who find blokeish complacency and the confirmation of stereotypes disappointing. When he invites requests, you might wish to shout out, \"Surprise us!\" \u0095 Until August 17. Box office: 0131-226 2428.
