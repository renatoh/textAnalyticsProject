What a player he is! It's been a semi-historic day, but tomorrow could be even better. Lara will resume needing 68 more runs to break the world record. I do hope you'll be able to join me. Thanks for all the emails. And good night. \"Before the close today, give us the lowdown on that rum will you, Lawrence?\" writes Geoff Woods. \"What proof is it? I remember once, back in the mists of time, sampling a contraband rum that had been smuggled into the country by an army officer. It was something like 150 proof, and a swig brought tears to the eyes. Is yours something similar?\" It's 70%, Geoff. Wish me luck. 156th over: West Indies 588-5 (Lara 307, Jacobs 46) One more to Lara. Good grief, I'm tired, so I can only imagine how Lara feels. \"Only one over to go, and you can sample the reward for your efforts,\" writes Chris Weaver. \"But it sounds as if it might be better to save the bottle for after the taxi back home, so that you can still locate your front door. We'll be understanding if the reports of the opening overs tomorrow are a bit hazy.\" 155th over: West Indies 586-5 (Lara 306, Jacobs 45) Just three overs to go, and Vaughan bowls the first of them. Lara takes another single and he eases down for the evening. Tomorrow, after all, is another day. \"I was at a Jamaican family do last night,\" says Andrew, \"complete with high intensity dominoes, cricket talk, the errrrr odd smoke, and more to the point, large quantities of various rums. There were some demon brands there - so I'm wondering what flavour rum you're resisting from sampling til after close of play?\" It's called Jack Iron. Should I beware? 154th over: West Indies 585-5 (Lara 305, Jacobs 45) Jacobs scores his first run for seven overs as the scoreboard inches along, then top-edges a cut for two off Batty. \"I don't know about the rum or the Greek wine,\" confesses Bradon Smith, \"but a single malt and the cricket is nicely distracting me from a dissertation. Yes, guilty as charged - one of those students writing theses on obscure topics.\" 153rd over: West Indies 580-5 (Lara 303, Jacobs 42) On comes Vaughan and Lara takes the longest of long singles to long-on. 152nd over: West Indies 579-5 (Lara 302, Jacobs 42) England haven't lost their discipline here at all. In fact, they've been experimenting with all kinds of deliveries. I like that. Just one off that Batty over. \"Nope, sorry I read the Indy,\" reveals Matthew Cobb, \"because it was a million miles better over the war (and still is). On the other hand, the GU website is excellent.\" You've redeemed yourself after a dodgy start to that email, Matthew. 151st over: West Indies 578-5 (Lara 301, Jacobs 42) I just said we can get on with the rest of the game. Actually, we can't, because the next landmark will be Matthew Hayden's 380. Which means England won't have to bat three full days to save the game. They're all very well these records, but this particular one might be getting in the way of a West Indian victory, flat track or not. A good over from Jones, who concedes just a single to Lara. \"A message for the other readers,\" writes Phil Sawyer. \"I imagine it's pretty difficult being sat next to a bottle of rum without being badgered to drink it. I, for one, admire your professionalism (although I notice you're off like a bat out of hell once the day's play is over).\" Well spotted, Phil. 150th over: West Indies 577-5 (Lara 300, Jacobs 42) There it is: Brian Lara has become the second batsman in Test history to score two triple-centuries! Great scenes here as the ground rises in unison to applaud an epic innings. It has taken him 404 balls and was brought up with a push and run to point for a single off Batty. Right, we can get on with the rest of the game now. \"I'm not sure Dan is telling the exact truth (in the 145th over - that's normally enough to bowl out the Windies for a series),\" writes Ashley Mills. \"The last thing I remember is Dan ripping his jeans while 'impressing' the locals by sumo-wrestling Homer. Anything would have passed for entertainment after watching the Chelsea-Boro game, or indeed this Test.\" 149th over: West Indies 576-5 (Lara 299, Jacobs 42) Lara moves to 299 with a work to long leg for one off Jones, and the ground prepares to erupt. \"No whitewash\" chant the locals as Jones almost foxes Jacobs with a couple of slower balls. And Lara will be on strike. \"I wonder how many of your cricket readers are actually Guardian readers,\" wonders Steve Hart. \"It would be an interesting survey. Perhaps.\" You're welcome to carry it out, Steve. 148th over: West Indies 575-5 (Lara 298, Jacobs 42) Lara top-edges a sweep off Batty, but the ball drops harmlessly out of reach of Geraint Jones behind the stumps and he takes a single. Jacobs adds one more before Lara hammers four runs straight through Batty's hands! That would have been an amazing catch. Lara will start the next over on 298. \"While my offer may have appeared generous,\" writes Phil Sawyer, \"I should remind you that I've now been down the local shop twice for their choice of wine rather than drink the aforementioned sweet Greek wine.\" I see where you're coming from, Phil. 147th over: West Indies 568-5 (Lara 292, Jacobs 42) Lara is creeping towards his triple-hundred, and pushes Jones to long-on for another single. If and when he gets there, he will become the first player since Don Bradman to make more than one Test triple-hundred, which is not bad company to be in. \"Clearly your audience are overwhelmingly in favour of you sampling the rum while continuing the commentary,\" writes Andrew. \"And we live in a democracy, after all.\" I prefer benevolent dictatorships myself, Andrew, which is why I won't be touching the stuff until the close. 146th over: West Indies 566-5 (Lara 291, Jacobs 41) Just a few signs that Lara is tiring, which is hardly surprising given that he has faced nearly 400 deliveries spread over two days. He misses a couple of attempted sweeps off Batty, although he does manage to connect with his third effort, which brings him a single. For lovers of obscure stats, that was Lara's 5000th run in home Tests. \"After pretending to be a Professor at Geneva University last week, Richard Jones now seems to be pretending he knows about cricket!\" scoffs Matthew Cobb. \"Unless of course, there is a joke and I've missed it.\" I'm awaiting the punchline myself, Matthew. 145th over: West Indies 565-5 (Lara 290, Jacobs 40) Lara picks up one more into the covers off Jones to move into the nervous 290s. \"I'm not surprised that Ashley Mills is too hungover to mock his rotund chum Homer today (110th over),\" writes Dan Ashley. \"I left him at about 9pm passed out in a bush moaning about losing a Chelsea cap he had stolen of a small child yesterday not far from Stamford Bridge.\" 144th over: West Indies 563-5 (Lara 289, Jacobs 39) Lara is playing very carefully now against Batty - something along the lines of, \"we'll get them in singles, man\". He makes do with a sweep for one in that over. Here's the ever-loyal Phil Sawyer. \"Taking up on Steve Hart's idea, I could send you the bottle of sweet Greek wine that a grateful postgraduate student gave me for attempting to shield them from the miserable chaos that is university life (I'm a university administrative officer, which is even less exciting than it sounds).\" I'm not sure I should be accepting any more bottles, Phil. Barry might tell. 143rd over: West Indies 561-5 (Lara 288, Jacobs 38) Jones goes up for a gut-wrenching lbw appeal against Lara, but that one pitched a long way outside leg-stump, and umpire Hair is having none of it. Lara then chops Jones to third man for two, before picking up a single with a gentle push to mid-off. Jacobs has given him great support here. Had he made a duck, Lara could easily have run out of partners. \"Given that Windies have been massacred this series I'd like to see Lara get the world record score back from that Aussie pretender,\" writes Robin Pharoah. 142nd over: West Indies 556-5 (Lara 285, Jacobs 36) Batty is the bowler thrown to the wolves by Vaughan first thing after the drinks break, but he is aiming outside Lara's leg-stump, which makes scoring nigh on impossible, even for this little genius. Just a single to Jacobs off that over. There are 15 overs to go this evening after this one, so if Lara continues to score at around two an over, he should have around 315 by the close. \"This is not getting us down at all,\" lies Richard Jones. \"This wicket is clearly a suet patch and Trescobelisk will be able to stand immutable and score six from every ball on Tuesday when England get to bat.\" 141st over: West Indies 555-5 (Lara 285, Jacobs 35) The field is spread out now, so there is a single on offer every ball. The new bowler, as if that matters at this stage, is Simon Jones, who concedes two singles to the aggressive Jacobs and one to Lara. That's drinks. \"You could have started a trend here,\" writes Steve Hart. \"People will send you booze like old ladies from the home counties send Blowers cakes.\" Fine by me, Steve. 140th over: West Indies 552-5 (Lara 284, Jacobs 33) For the moment, this game is all about one man. Marcus Trescothick. Nah, just kidding. The question is, does Lara want his world record back? And is he prepared to put himself before the team to do it? Depending on how quickly he scores, the two factors need not be exclusive. \"Not drinking on the job?!\" exclaims Stephen Allan in something approaching disgust. \"My dad and my brother-in-law are both journos so I really think that is a lame excuse for not sampling Mat's kind offering.\" But who would keep you updated with England's mauling, Stephen? 139th over: West Indies 549-5 (Lara 284, Jacobs 30) It's very easy to forget that England are leading this series 3-0. But I shall just drop that one into conversation to prevent any of you getting too down. Jacobs tonks Flintoff over cow corner for six and into the streets beyond, and there aren't many batsmen who do that to Freddie. Shot! \"How could Barry Glendenning possibly object?\" writes Sunil Sikka a propos the Grenadian-rum debate. \"He's already had a swig.\" Quite. 138th over: West Indies 540-5 (Lara 283, Jacobs 22) Jacobs launches Trescothick to the left of mid-off for four, moments after Trescothick's hoarse cry of \"catch\" rents the Antiguan air. Lara picks up four more with another leg-side tickle - he's seizing on absolutely anything off line here. \"Been offline for a while as my wife was checking her Siamese Fighting Fish message boards (and getting increasingly frustrated trying to explain Aesop's fables to middle-americans),\" reports Phil Sawyer. \"Also, I went back down the local shop for more wine on the basis that if it's sucking my gums back from my teeth it's also probably destroying any harmful bacteria.\" Yes, we get all sorts on our website! 137th over: West Indies 531-5 (Lara 279, Jacobs 17) Flintoff sends down a joke delivery which involves not using his left arm at all. You've got to laugh, eh? But Lara isn't. He wants that triple-century, and I suspect he's going to get it. As things stand, England will be looking at a total of 400-plus just to save the follow-on. A maiden. \"If England win the Ashes,\" writes Matthew Wassell, in-no-way-prematurely, \"can we all come down to GU towers to see how the other half (of the Internet) live? I wouldn't mind writing a few words on the sacred computers of the Guardian Online.\" If England win the Ashes, Matthew, I shall treat you all to a drink. Of Grenadian rum. 136th over: West Indies 531-5 (Lara 279, Jacobs 17) Lara inches closer to his second Test triple-century with a single to fine leg off Trescothick, who has bowled manfully today. There are 21 overs to go after this one, assuming the light holds. By that time Lara should be well past 300. Richard Jones is talking gobbledegook again, which makes two of us. \"As I'm an optimist by nature and design,\" he writes, \"it's worth remarking that at end today we will only be two overs away from a new ball. WI needs to score as best they can now. They will only get 40 or so after the new ball. Seriously, England need to psychoneurose themselves to avoid the follow-on.\" I couldn't agree more. Hic. 135th over: West Indies 528-5 (Lara 277, Jacobs 16) Lara moves on to 277 with a dab for one off Flintoff. That equals his second-highest score in Tests. And the whole thing has felt so pre-destined. Amazing, really. \"Hey, Larry,\" writes Matthew. \"We heard last week that you had moved to \"trendy West London\" (a contradiction in terms I reckon, but there you go). Does this report from the BBC website have anything to do with you? \"A 12-bedroom mansion in west London has been sold for a record \u00a370m\"?\" That's the one, Matthew. Cheap at twice the price. 134th over: West Indies 527-5 (Lara 276, Jacobs 16) Good grief, that rum is strong! In the meantime - hic - Marsuc Treskothic - hic - bowls an over that costs two rusn. Hic. \"Wow, Mat's generosity has inspired me,\" writes Dierk Widmann in Salzburg. \"Have just poured a shot of nondescript Austrian rum (Mautner Original Inl\u00e4nder, since I sense your question) and am enjoying the Guardian coverage with it. Not quite in the Grenadian league, but don't ask me what they make the stuff from over here. It does work, though.\" 133rd over: West Indies 525-5 (Lara 275, Jacobs 15) Lara is motoring now. He pulls Flintoff for four, then cuts him behind point for another boundary, before making it three fours in the over with an on-sidish straight-drive. Magic. \"Don't think I'm a puritan, Lawrence, I'm just envious, that's all,\" writes Geoff Woods as a follow-up to his contribution in the 129th over. \"My wife and daughter are in Seattle for the weekend, and my son has gone rock-climbing in Oregon. I've been left behind in Vancouver to feed the cat, so I could do with a bottle of that rum myself.\" Barry Glendenning begs to differ, Geoff. He's still coughing. 132nd over: West Indies 513-5 (Lara 263, Jacobs 15) Lara flicks Trescothick fine for four with a delicate turn of the wrists, and Tresco lets out a strangled cry, rather like a baby seal. My money is on West Indies batting until tomorrow. I reckon Lara wants a crack at the record. \"I'd go for the rum, if I were you Lawrence,\" writes Stephen Allan. \"Half-cut comments from you might make for some amusing reading. Beats chocolate cake, don't you think?\" I suppose so, Stephen, but Barry Glendenning is watching and I don't want to be caught drinking on the job. 131st over: West Indies 507-5 (Lara 258, Jacobs 14) Flintoff goes up for a big shout for lbw against Lara, but that hit him just outside the line of off stump and umpire Hair is rightly unmoved. That's about as close as England have come to taking his wicket. \"Matthew and or Tina,\" writes Neil Stork-Brett. \"Re my surname - who on earth would make up such a ridiculous surname? Tis a distinguished moniker of good Buckinghamshire stock, who fell on hard times and were transported to the colonies - though having been to Bucks I'm bloody glad, I can tell you.\" 130th over: West Indies 505-5 (Lara 257, Jacobs 13) Vaughan turns to Trescothick once more, and why not: he proved surprisingly effective earlier. And he even makes one bounce at Jacobs, which demands some nifty glovework from Jones. Barry Glendenning has just sampled Mat Wrigley's rum - just a swig, mind - and has uttered too many oaths for inclusion here. Just two off the over. \"It's Charlie the diet man back again,\" writes Charlie Jeffery. \"I've been reflecting on some of those horrific sandwich fillings suggested earlier, egg and mushroom and god knows what else, it almost makes me want to diet. And that Rum should be interesting, I'm looking forward to see your commentary go down the corridor of uncertainty.\" I'll have a drop at the close, Charlie and let you know tomorrow. 129th over: West Indies 503-5 (Lara 256, Jacobs 12) Back comes Flintoff, and there goes Mat Wrigley, who is flying back to Grenada on Tuesday. What a nice man. That's a maiden to Jacobs. \"Don't touch that rum, Lawrence, it'll fry your brain,\" writes Geoff Woods. \"You should have stayed in Cheshire, where the cheese is harmless.\" 128th over: West Indies 503-5 (Lara 256, Jacobs 12) There's no stopping Lara now, and he brings up the West Indies 500 (not a sentence I expected to write two days ago) with a lovely drive down the ground for four off Batty. I hate to say it, but Lara has just found sixth gear. To rub it in, England concede an overthrow. \"Tina is the name of She Who Did All The Cooking and was intended as a greeting to her, not a signature!\" writes Matthew Cobb. \"She hates cricket.\" 127th over: West Indies 496-5 (Lara 251, Jacobs 10) Jacobs hammers Harmison through extra-cover for four to spoil what would have been an over-by-over-writer-friendly maiden. \"As Mat was there for the fall of that wicket he'll have to stay for the remaining overs now,\" writes Neil Stork-Brett. Don't worry, Neil, he's still here. 126th over: West Indies 492-5 (Lara 251, Jacobs 6) Lara moves to 250 with successive fours off Batty - down the ground and inside-out over extra-cover. What an innings it's been: 324 balls, 27 fours and two sixes. And all the time he gets ever closer to his second Test triple-century. Jacobs then joins in with a back-foot force through the covers for four. Poor old Batty. \"If it's any consolation, my wife and I were so busy over the last couple of days we kind of forgot the shops were shut today,\" said Phil Sawyer. \"Our Easter feast has therefore been provided by the local 24 hour. I'm about to tuck into a slap-up bowl of cereal.\" 125th over: West Indies 478-5 (Lara 242, Jacobs 1) Harmison is still steaming in at 85mph, but he's not getting much change out of the St John's strip. Even so, he manages to hit Jacobs with a bouncer that doesn't get up. \"What is it about Derby?\" asks Sunil Sikka out of nowhere. \"They play Cricket at the Racecourse ground and Footy at the Baseball ground. Still, the Tea Shop at the Cricket ground provides the best brekkie I've ever has. Eggs, bacon, sausage, black pudding, beans, chips and tomatoes all for 3 quid.\" I'm with you there, Sunil. 124th over: West Indies 476-5 (Lara 241, Jacobs 0) Mat is trying to persuade me to drink some of his rum, but - ever the semi-professional - I decline. Tempting, mind. In the mean-time, Lara sweeps Batty for two. Just nine needed for the 250. \"Just been out in the garden for a glass of wine in the hope that England would rally while I was gone,\" writes Phil Sawyer. \"They haven't.\" 123rd over: West Indies 474-5 (Lara 239, Jacobs 0) Harmison beats Lara outside off-stump, but the response is typically world-class - a pull for four through midwicket. \"How dare this Stork-Brett (a made-up name if ever I heard one) come and start talking about cricket?\" writes Matthew Cobb/Tina. \"We get enough of that from the journo! We want more food, drink, stupid boyfriends and strange musical combos... PS Roast chicken/greens/spuds/broccoli/tomatoes/stuffing washed down with Safeway's best - Chateau Chaubinet Bordeaux 2002, a snip @ \u00a34.50. Cheers, Tina!\" WICKET! Hinds c and b Batty 36 (469-5) Hinds is livid with himself after going down the track to Batty and getting a little leading edge back to the bowler. Right, we're into the tail. Well, RIdley Jacobs. I can exclusively reveal that one of our readers, Mat Wrigley, has turned up in person at GU towers to hand over - as promised - a bottle of the finest (so he says) Grenadian \"mind-bending\" rum. I can honestly say this is one of the most remarkable things that has ever happened to me. Mat is now sitting over my shoulder watching the cricket. I think this is taking inter-activity to a ridiculous extreme... 121st over: West Indies 462-4 (Lara 229, Hinds 34) Frustration here for England as Lara runs Harmison through the sparsely populated slip cordon and away for four. The tactics are clearly to hurl the ball as far as possible out of Lara's reach, but umpire Hair isn't impressed and calls Harmison for two wides. Richard Jones is taking some consolation in England's performance here. \"As I have said to you before,\" he writes, \"the current situation is good for England. They need a good conscionable draw, which will drive them in the right way from a reasonably good side today, especially bowlers, to a top-three world side in two years. A 4-0 victory would have been a strategic disaster.\" That's one way of looking at it, Richard. 120th over: West Indies 455-4 (Lara 224, Hinds 34) Batty to Hinds, who has played a curious innings in the circumstances and can do nothing about a maiden there. That's fine by England. \"Actually the wine's from the 24-hour too,\" writes Phil Sawyer, possibly referring to an earlier email which currently escapes me. \"I'm currently trying to stop my gums shrinking back from my teeth.\" 119th over: West Indies 455-4 (Lara 224, Hinds 34) Hinds edges Harmison between first and third slip - the only problem is, there's no second slip, so Hinds picks up four very lucky runs. He then steals the strike again with a pull for one. \"Am I the only person who is remotely surprised that Trescothick was able to move his feet fast enough to bowl?\" asks Alex Gerrard, not unreasonably. 118th over: West Indies 450-4 (Lara 224, Hinds 29) A good over from Batty to Hinds, how hasn't really kicked on as Lara might have hoped. He has now faced 81 balls for his 29, and to make matters worse, pinches the strike with a sweep for one. \"Sandwich spread IS good,\" writes Carl Logan, \"but don't forget about fried egg and mushroom, or peanut butter and cucumber.\" I won't, Carl. Be assured of that. 117th over: West Indies 449-4 (Lara 224, Hinds 28) Harmison takes up the attack after tea. There are a maximum of 41 overs still to be bowled, and the question is: will West Indies bat on until tomorrow? England will be hoping so, assuming, of course, they don't bowl them out. Harmison begins with a maiden to Lara. \"As the series is safely in the back pocket, I'd like to see the English batsmen take their time out in the middle this game and really knuckle down and put some runs on the board,\" writes Neil Stork-Brett. \"Especially Tresco and Vaughan. There is a one-day competition still to be played for, and the lads really don't want to surrender the psychological advantage they have at the moment by putting in an average performance. I wouldn't read too much into the bowling this game so far as the pitch has obviously got nothing in it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
