At the same time, however, I have yet to see any mention or similar coverage of the organisation Republic, giving a balancing perspective. Its publications include a thorough analysis of the vast cost to the taxpayer of the royals, the extent of the wealth held by them and the lack of public engagements by some of those receiving such funds. At a time of growing concern about rising income inequality and poorly funded public services, Larry Elliott\u2019s quotation from Tony Benn\u2019s diaries, written at the time of the Queen\u2019s silver jubilee celebrations in 1977, remains apt today: \u201cthe press plays it up to divert people from unemployment and the cost of living and the EEC and so on.\u201d Rev Canon Jane Fraser Worcester \u2022 The British royal family\u2019s current popularity should not detract from the role it has played in advancing the UK\u2019s diplomatic goals over decades, and beyond. The Queen has been to 116 countries on 266 official visits. She has also hosted many prime ministers and presidents in the UK. The US, as highlighted by President Trump\u2019s recent state visit is a case in point. She has met all but one of the 13 US presidents during her reign, and has visited the US 11 times as sovereign. Even before her reign, the royals were cultivating diplomatic ties with the US. Her father, King George VI, made the first visit by a British sovereign in 1939, on the eve of the war. Zaki Cooper London \u2022 Larry Elliott says: \u201cthere have been 13 US presidents since the Queen came to the throne \u2026 so she has plenty of practice in hosting a state visit.\u201d She has, in fact, done it only twice before: George W Bush came in 2003 and Barack Obama in 2011. An invitation to a state visit is not sent to every president. It must have made Donald Trump feel very special.
