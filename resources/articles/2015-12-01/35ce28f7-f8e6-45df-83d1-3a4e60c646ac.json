So, if my hypothesis is correct, then this letter will not have one \u2026 Professor Roger Ingham Southampton \u2022 \u2026 but this one will \u2026 Professor Roger Ingham Southampton \u2022 All letters have orange dots, apart from the first letter on each topic or letters from people called Kehoe. Karl Sabbagh Newbold on Stour, Warwickshire \u2022 People deal with pet loss in different ways (Cloned pups show there is life in the old dog, 24 December), but the most important thing is to give yourself enough time to go through the grieving process. Trying to get over the loss by getting a new one may lead to unresolved grief, which can bring about difficult emotions. We\u2019re available 365 days of the year for bereavement support on 0800 096 6606 or pbssmail@bluecross.org.uk. Tracie McGrory Pet Bereavement Support Service, Blue Cross, Oxford \u2022 John Crace\u2019s story about his Christmas present (The ugly shirt held a message it took me years to understand, 22 December) reminded me of a story heard some years ago. A lady received a present of Evening in Paris perfume. She re-wrapped and passed it on the following Christmas and this went around for some years until she finally got it back. In 1983, a friend\u2019s husband won a raffle prize and mistakenly picked a bottle of foul-smelling aftershave, thinking it was perfume. We exchange this every year and we are hoping to make it to at least 40 years. Can you have vintage aftershave?
