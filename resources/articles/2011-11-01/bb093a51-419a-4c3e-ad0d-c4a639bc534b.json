It is understood that the wish is for the match to be a meaningful fixture as preparation for the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign that starts later in the year and which Speed viewed as a real chance to take Wales to a major tournament for the first time since 1958. The opposition, and whether the friendly will be played home or away, is yet to be decided but if it is staged in Wales the Football Association of Wales will ensure that proceedings in and around the match will be a memorial to Speed. The FAW's first thought is to allow a suitable period of mourning. The national body is determined that Speed's family are left to grieve, so any decision regarding how best to pay tribute to him will wait until they are ready to discuss the matter. Some fans have proposed that the game on 29 February, which is during the next window in the international calendar and is a friendly, be staged between a Wales XI and an All Star XI, or a Wales team featuring former players against the current Wales side. Neville Southall, Wales's most-capped player, favours an alternative. \"I'd love to see them play a game in an international week against players from his former clubs,\" the former goalkeeper said. \"Get some of the Newcastle lads down, some from Everton, Bolton, Sheffield United, Leeds and maybe dedicate the game to his family. Pack the Millennium and everyone can pay their respects. If that can't be done, I'd like to see a proper footballing power turn up. If they did put a proper Wales team, it would be a proper event. It would be a sombre event but it would be a success.\" With the packed domestic calendar, the staging of specially arranged Wales game is not thought feasible at the FAW, with the body also conscious that Speed's family should lead the way regarding how best to remember him. The FAW president and the chief executive spoke on Monday for the first time regarding Speed, and has announced that a book of remembrance has been opened at its offices in Cardiff, and an area outside has been set aside for a garden of remembrance. Phil Pritchard, the president of the FAW, said that Sepp Blatter, the Fifa president, and Michel Platini, the president of Uefa, had contacted him to offer their condolences. In a letter, Blatter also said that the Wales flag at Fifa headquarters in Zurich was flying at half-mast. Pritchard said: \"It's been a tremendous shock to us all. Obviously Louise [Speed's wife] and the family are foremost in our thoughts. It takes a lot of taking in. The tributes to him are endless \u2013 we are going to miss him tremendously in Welsh football; the world in football is going to miss him. I've already had a personal communication from Mr Blatter, the president of Fifa, and from Mr Platini. That's the respect that he has. At the moment we're all still in shock.\" The FAW chief executive, Jonathan Ford, told Sky that it had yet to begin the search for a successor to Speed. \"I received a telephone call from police yesterday and I was in utter shock and disbelief,\" he said. \"First and foremost our condolences must be with his family. The future we haven't even thought of. All we've done is cried. None of this makes sense. I don't know if we'll ever know. I've nothing to add and no further news.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
