So an animal might be a cryptodont (lacking obvious teeth), and a politician might be a crypto-fascist. Cryptography is \u201csecret writing\u201d, or coded communication \u2013 as with the German Enigma machine, or encrypted messaging services. And cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin) is digital coinage that uses cryptographical techniques for secure transactions. Facebook calls its new cryptocurrency the Libra, which was the Roman word for \u201cscales\u201d or \u201cbalance\u201d and also a unit of weight. So the modern pound is abbreviated \u201clb\u201d, and the star sign Libra holds the scales of justice. And, given its record on privacy, users might wonder just how long their cryptocurrency transactions will remain safe from prying eyes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
