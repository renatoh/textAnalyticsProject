When I first saw the film The Terminator, I was aghast at the flashback scenes of a violent, dystopian future. Mechanised baddies striding through a pocked and cratered landscape piled high with rubble and skeletons. I may have groaned aloud. There was certainly some shushing in the seats around me (and some titters too). But look, I felt like saying to them, there are no flat spaces at all. They have absolutely nowhere to play a game of cricket. It wasn\u2019t that this was among my thoughts. It was my only thought. I thought of this again these last few days. I live in Paris, not far from that neighbourhood which wicked and foolish men tried to turn into an abattoir. As the news rolled in and the toll mounted, grief set in like some new and permanent illness. Quickly, I learnt to avoid the pictures of faces that could hardly be borne. Almost all so young and so disconcertingly, dismayingly beautiful. Faces full of future, of almost ludicrous promise. Having lived three decades of this kind of barbarity in Belfast, I knew to seek some tiny solace, some distraction. So, I did exactly what I had done on the long, sleepless night after the Charlie Hebdo attack \u2013 I switched on the cricket. I let that ridiculous Australian sunshine wash over me. I listened to the achingly bad banter of the Channel Nine commentary jocks. I watched David Warner resume on 244, waiting for him to amass some absurd strato-score that would make me feel like a boy again. I\u2019ve tried very hard to dislike Warner. I gave it my best shot. But this being cricket, I now adore him. Predictably, he was out nine runs later. Just as I had been after January\u2019s horror, I was overwhelmed by the extraordinary happiness that this bright but wistful sport can bring. Its beauty was breathtaking. Not for a moment did I forget what had happened. Every now and then, I would go to the window and look out at chilled and unsleeping Paris. I could hear occasional sirens and the soothing chuckle of a helicopter (a sound that had helped me sleep as a child). The streets were empty of people. The wakeful lights in the apartment windows spoke of bedless vigil. I wondered what solace my neighbours were seeking. It\u2019s too easy to say that cricket seemed like the opposite of what had occurred in my city a few hours before. Any constructive, life-loving human activity is the opposite of that pernicious infamy and the opposite of its wretched practitioners too, the proud enemies of funny and of football, of youth and of beauty. Cricket is, nonetheless, its opposite. Because, cricket, for all its mournful nostalgia, is the essential comic sport. Cricket is a Comedy in the fullest sense of the word. It is a nonsensical pursuit. At the lower levels, it is the summery, youthful game that can be played by the nearly-decrepit (and played well too). Passionate over-eaters are entirely welcome and often much admired \u2013 can anyone really claim that Inzamam Ul-Haq or David Boon would have been so thoroughly loved had they been slim? Men play with women in scratch games without blinking. Boys play with men. Newbies and veterans happily combine. But most unbeatably, cricket is the one sport on the planet that welcomes, with delight, those who are just no good at playing it. We\u2019ve all been in teams made up of total duffers. Never mind not being able to bowl or bat, we\u2019ve played in elevens stocked by people who couldn\u2019t bend down. Everyone\u2019s batted in an innings of 30 all out, or faced bowlers who appealed on the rare occasions they hit the cut part of the pitch. Terrible cricketers are riotously proud of how bad they are, as though they were the winning result in some divine experiment in ineptitude. Bad cricket is a brotherhood, a sisterhood of the bumbling and the hapless. They are the soul of the game. Its poets and seers. And as spectators of top flight cricket, we impose that triumphantly human ethos upon superb international athletes. Woe to the famous cricketer who seems to take himself too seriously. Players\u2019 discourse is now a media-studies mantra of professionalism and preparation. That stuff bores cricket people rigid. Do it, by all means, but like laws and sausages, we don\u2019t want to see how it\u2019s done. Pretend you got your hundred with a terrible hangover. Say your matchwinning hat-trick only happened because you were desperate to pee. It\u2019s remarkable, is it not, that there so few hated cricketers. Many are mocked and derided but few are loathed the way footballers can be. Because unlike other sports, cricket\u2019s not very good at hatred. It has no real darkness. A sport that stops for bad light can\u2019t really muster much murkiness. And it is also, perhaps, because cricket is a fragile and dwindling beauty, semi-permanently on the cusp of some long-awaited extinction. That night in Paris, deeply unhappy but transfixed, I was reminded of the consoling optimism of this silly, complicated jewel of a game, so illuminated by its remarkable fans and by its giant writers. I don\u2019t know whether there can be real consolation in the face of such loss and such enmity. But as I wrote that night, it felt like life, that cricket match, life being thoroughly and joyously lived. It brought me unforgettable light. \u2022 Robert McLiam Wilson is a Northern Irish novelist who has lived in Paris for the past decade and writes for Charlie Hebdo and The Big Issue.
