We'll be back in the morning to assess flooding from overnight and the threat from new high tides. PA report that more properties were being evacuated in Kent tonight - 70 in Seasalter and 200 in Faversham - ahead of expected flooding in the early hours of tomorrow. A Kent County Council spokesman said: \"The Environment Agency and Met Office are forecasting that there is a significant risk to people and property as tides combine with a coastal surge and significant waves, overnight and again on Friday afternoon. \"For those who are unable to find alternative accommodation, we are working with our colleagues in Dover District Council, Canterbury City Council, Swale Borough Council, the NHS and the voluntary sector to ensure residents' welfare needs, including feeding and bedding, are catered for at evacuation centres. \"Community wardens and police officers are making door-to-door visits.\" Another image from Hull. The Environment Agency has raised the number of severe flood warnings from 41 at 4.30pm to 56 now. These range from Yorkshire to Kent with 36 in Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. While some places have already had one high tide, the next will arrive 12 hours later, so tomorrow morning could see more flooding. I understand from the Ministry of Defence that some soldiers have been drafted in to help the emergency services in Norfolk. More reports of rivers bursting their banks and residents being ordered to leave their homes in north Lincolnshire from the Scunthorpe Telegraph REPORTS of flooding have started to come in from a number of villages in North Lincolnshire. Early reports suggest rivers have burst their banks at Gunness, Althorpe, Burton-upon-Stather, South Ferriby and West Butterwick. 8pm: Homes reported to have been flooded in South Ferriby and residents have been evacuated. 8.50pm: Council officials confirm South Ferriby and Winteringham have been evacuated. A spokeswoman for North Lincolnshire Council said: \"The council has received flooding along the South Humber Bank.Affected residents in Winteringham are advised to go to The Pods in Scunthorpe. \"Affected residents in South Ferriby are requested to head to Baysgarth Leisure Centre, which is now open as a rest room.\" Reports also suggest the River Trent has burst its banks in Keadby. Reports also say Althorpe is under threat and there is flooding in Whitton. Here's some more footage of the Emirates flight from Dubai trying to land at Birmingham today. It was eventually diverted to Gatwick. High tide has peaked at Hull but now other areas will be effected. Warnings to Goole residents and Lincolshire coast will be next in line. Hull town centre this evening. Here's an image of the floods in Hull. Water still rising around Hull. Some areas have lost power so no lights. People abandoning cars and sirens can be heard everywhere. Radio Humberside has all its staff dotted around and giving phone interviews. Judging from Radio Humberside, there is quite serious flooding in Hull city centre with flooding in several major roads including the A63. Roads are closed and trains cancelled and there is traffic gridlock in some areas. Police are asking people to leave Victoria Dock and coast guards are pulling back to higher ground. Local journalists are astonished by the amount of water coming over the banks. One described it as a \"mini tsunami\". Here is our main wrap of the main weather events from today. Two people were killed, dozens were injured and thousands of residents were rescued or fled from their homes on Thursday as the UK was battered by powerful winds and seaside communities were threatened by the worst storm surge for more than 60 years. The government's emergency Cobra committee met twice and local emergency plans swung into operation as the surge threatened to engulf areas of the east coast of England from Northumberland to Kent plus parts of the north-west from Cumbria to Cheshire as well as communities in north Wales. Emergency services and local authorities advised more than 15,000 people to leave their homes on the east coast of England. Some were due to spend a worrying night with relatives or in emergency rest centres, although many others refused to move, insisting they would stay to protect their properties. I have just been listening to Radio Humberside where listeners are describing flooding all around the River Humber. There's flooding at Kingston Retail Park, Victoria Dock and several other areas. Some are saying they haven't seen anything like the flood levels before and it is still 30 minutes until high tide. Flooding in Hamburg, Germany this evening. We've just had this message below the line from EUconcernedcitizen near Ostend. I'm in Belgium. We're waiting for the high tide at around 3am Belgian time. My brother in law has been given an order to evacuate (along with 2000 other residents of Bredene Sas - close to Ostend). We live with the memories of 1953 and hope that we don't see a repeat of history. Owen Duffy has seen the Glasgow Evening Times which is reporting that passengers of the 7.35am easyjet flight from Gatwick to Glasgow have had a very difficult journey. The crew abandoned their attempt at landing at Glasgow and diverted to Edinburgh. By time they arrived at Edinburgh so had the wind and they had to abort their landing. The aircraft had an easier landing at Manchester. We hear that 1705 Euston-Lichfield has been stopped because a tree fell on its tracks near Sutton Coldfield. No reports of damage to the train or harm to passengers. When the Thames Flood Barrier closes at around 10pm tonight it will be the second time since 2010 that it has been closed because of the threat of tidal flood. Between 1983 and 2000, the barrier was closed because of a tidal threat 25 times. Between 2000 and now, the figure is 52. According to PA the water at Blakeney in north Norfolk breached the quay at about 5.30pm. Within 30 minutes the floods had advanced about 50 metres up the village's main street. Allan Urquhart, who has lived on the seafront, brought a rowing boat to the King's Arm pub to collect a friend. He said: \"I'm going to row back to the house and we'll stay upstairs tonight. \"We've put sandbags in place so hopefully we'll be ok, I'm as confident as I can be. \"This is the worst flooding I've seen so it could be a difficult night for lots of people.\" Drew Taylor, from Cley next the Sea, said it was the worst flooding he had seen since 1978. \"This is far beyond normal,\" he added. \"The speed it's advancing at it is a real worry.\" This image of high tide at Morecambe has just arrived. Closer to the UK, Reuters are reporting that other North Sea countries are facing similar probems. Germany's northern port of Hamburg was preparing for a direct hit, which some forecasters said could be as powerful as a storm and flood in the city in 1962 that killed 315. Hamburg airport cancelled all flights and many schools and Christmas markets were closed. Ferries to Germany's North Sea islands were kept in port and some industrial plants closed. \"The truly dangerous thing about this storm is that the winds will continue for hours and won't let up,\" said Andreas Friedrich, a German weather service meteorologist. \"The danger of coastal flooding is high.\" Friedrich said people were being advised to stay indoors because of the risk of trees being toppled or roofs blown off. An extreme weather warning was issued for the northern states of Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony and Bremen. The Oresund bridge linking southern Sweden with Denmark was shut at 1500 GMT. Some railway lines in southern Sweden were closed, with high winds expected in the south and heavy snow further north. In Denmark, railroad company DSB said it would stop operating most trains. Airline Alsie Express cancelled all domestic flights and the 6.8-km (four-mile) Great Belt Bridge, which includes a 1.6-km suspension bridge section, was closed. Trains in the northern Netherlands were halted, Dutch Railways said. At Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport 50 flights were cancelled, a spokeswoman said, adding there could be further cancellations. There's flooding around the Mediterranean as well. Here a cat tries to negotiate flood waters in the Gaza Strip. High tides are hitting the Yorkshire coast at the moment and moving south as the evening progresses. Hightide was at 5.54pm at Bridlington, 7.06pm Grimsby, 7.43pm Hull, 11pm Lowestoft, 1.39am Clacton and 2.52am Tilbury. PA are reporting that the immediate danger from flooding has passed in Rhyl . About 400 people are sheltering at Rhyl Leisure Centre after flooding in the Garford Road area. Emergency services are searching affected properties in an effort to account for all residents. A similar rest centre at Holywell Leisure Centre has now closed after the surrounding area escaped any serious flooding. Chief Superintendent Jeremy Vaughan, who is leading the multi-agency response across North Wales, said: \"Although the immediate danger has passed, we are assessing the overall situation and providing assistance where it is needed. \"We would ask people to monitor emergency services messages online, on radio and television for the latest information.\" Here's a good picture of the seafront at Cleethorpes an hour before high tide. The Emirates aircraft that had difficulty landing at Birmingham, which we posted footage of earlier, clearly gave up and diverted to another airport. My colleague Fredrick McConnell sends this summary of this afternoon's main developments so far: \u2022 Two people have been killed as storms battered Britain today. A lorry driver died in West Lothian when his HGV toppled onto a number of cars as high winds and gales battered Scotland, while a second man was killed by a falling tree in Retford, Nottinghamshire. \u2022 Residents of Sandwich in Kent have been told to get ready to evacuate their homes as severe flooding is predicted in the town. The Environment Agency sent residents an email headed: \"Severe Flooding. Danger to life.\" The Environment Agency \u2013 which covers England and Wales \u2013 has 41 severe flood warnings in place, most of them along the whole east coast of England, with some on the south coast near the Isle of Wight. In Newcastle, the rivers Tyne and Ouseburn have partially burst their banks. \u2022 The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has urged motorists to avoid driving through flooded areas. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has flood warnings in place for 19 regions of Scotland. Some rail services restarted this afternoon, but passengers were urged to check before making their journeys. \u2022 Around 3,700 homes are without electricity in Northern Ireland. \u2022 Norfolk police are urging residents in 9,000 homes in Great Yarmouth to prepare to leave for up to 36 hours. Norfolk\u2019s deputy chief constable Charlie Hall said: \"This is a significant policing operation underlined by the number of people and properties affected.\" \u2022 The environment secretary Owen Paterson was due to chair a second meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee this afternoon to discuss the response to the storm. The Scottish Ambulance Service has been in touch to say that local reports of damage to their helipad were inaccurate and that it remains in operation, reports Owen Duffy. A GuardianWitness reader sends this story: A number of YouTube users are posting pictures of planes trying \u2013 and failing \u2013 to land today. The Environment Agency, which covers England and Wales, is currently showing 41 severe flood warnings, 125 flood warnings, and 77 of the lowest level flood alerts. Most of the severe warnings are along the whole east coast as far south as Sandwich, Kent. There is another clump of severe warnings just north of Liverpool on the west coast and on the south coast near the Isle of Wight. Owen Duffy sends this statement from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service: Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) and Police Scotland, along with other partner agencies, are urging motorists to avoid driving through flooded areas. There have been a small number of reported incidents to emergency services where vehicles have become stuck after trying to drive through flood water. Motorists are advised to seek alternative routes and not drive through flooded areas, no matter how shallow the water looks. Motorists in Buckie are also being advised to avoid the coast road due to flooding and high tides. Here's Owen Duffy's report on the latest from Scotland. This is another tweet from Newcastle. In Great Yarmouth, police are calling for residents to evacuate their homes for 36 hours to avoid three high tides that will take place over that period. A dramatic photo here from Newcastle, where the River Tyne seems to be lapping at the pavement. In Manchester city centre, part of Deansgate, one of the main commercial roads through the centre, has been closed, with the BBC reporting the cause was something falling from a building on the street. Transport for Greater Manchester reports it has reopened. Here is a video clip of strong winds around the harbour at Whitehaven, Cumbria. MPs seem to be having problems getting back to their constituencies or getting around. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has issued flood warnings for 19 regions of Scotland, reports Owen Duffy. The full list is available here. People in the affected areas are being urged to take immediate action to prepare for flooding. The agency has also issued 12 lower priority flood warnings for areas which could be hit by floods. The prospect of an imminent flood is always, for all sorts of reasons, alarming, writes Peter Walker in Sandwich, Kent. But when you have just spent a small fortune on a refurbishment that finished exactly a day before, there\u2019s an extra level of apprehension. \u201cCarry on regardless. That\u2019s all we can do,\u201d said Tracie, sitting a few yards from the dining room of the Bell pub and hotel in Sandwich, north Kent, where the wallpapering was completed on Wednesday and a few builders\u2019 tools still litter the floor. That room is, at least, a few steps up. The revamped bar\u201a completed last week and with a bespoke tiled floor which still smells brand news, is at ground level. \u201cWe carry on as normal and if the water comes in we put our wellies on,\u201d said Tracie. \u201cNature is nature. We can just hope it all flows into the basement.\u201d While the Bell, and the rest of Sandwich, sits some distance from the coast itself, it directly adjoins the River Stour, forecast to be swept by a wind-exacerbated tidal surge, feared to be the worse in 30 years, shortly after midnight, with another to follow 12 hours later. Sandwich, one of England\u2019s most important medieval ports before river silting stopped bigger ships from coming so far inland, is subject to a severe flood warning from the Environment Agency, which warns that a surge of about 1.4m could cause \u201cdangerously high water levels\u201d in the town, as well as a series of other places along the north Kent coast. The Sandwich riverside is in the middle of a \u00a321m project to improve its elderly flood defences, and these in turn have been boosted by emergency measures, as well as piles of sandbags alongside properties like the Bell. But the Environment Agency was warning that this was unlikely to be enough. \u201cWe\u2019re predicting that even our temporary additional defences are very likely to be over-topped,\u201d said Alison Baptiste, the agency\u2019s flood manager for the south-east region. \u201cSo we are expecting quite a number of properties to be flooded across Kent.\u201d Sandwich was expected to be the worst hit, she said, with up to 200 homes and businesses at risk: \u201cWe\u2019re urging people to take action, to protect their property where they can, move any valuables and move their vehicles, and also to take care for themselves. \u201cA very low amount of water can sweep you off your feet. Even six inches, if it\u2019s fast-flowing, can be enough.\u201d Some tweets from around the country. The first is from Spalding, Lincolnshire. Scotrail have tweeted that these services are now running again: \u2022 Glasgow Central to Motherwell via Newton \u2022 Glasgow Central to East Kilbride \u2022 Glasgow Central to Barrhead \u2022 North Berwick to Edinburgh Sleeper services are set to run as normal, but passengers are strongly advised to check before making their journeys, Owen Duffy reports. The Press Association reports that the man killed in Retford was on a mobility scooter. A Nottinghamshire police spokeswoman confirmed that King's Park, where the incident took place, had been closed following the incident, which happened at about 1.50pm. The Lincolnshire Echo has more on the man killed in Retford. The paper reports: Police and council workers have closed King\u2019s Park in Retford following the incident and set up cordons at the West Street and Pelham Street entrances. The tree, which is believed to be about 40ft high, fell directly onto a path as the man was walking through the park with a shopping trolley. His body is still trapped under the tree and police and council staff work to move it. A bit of a tasteless tweet from Virgin Trains, which seems to be in a kind of propaganda war with rival East Coast rail about which objects have prevented trains from operating today. The BBC is reporting a second fatality due to the storm \u2013 a man killed by a falling tree in Retford, Nottinghamshire. Earlier a lorry driver was killed in West Lothian when his HGV toppled onto a number of cars as high winds and gales battered Scotland. More details soon ... Here are a couple of photos you've sent in from New Brighton, near Liverpool. Lifeboats have used to ferry residents from flooded homes in north Wales, PA reports. Flood rescue teams from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and North Wales Fire and Rescue Service are now conducting street by street searches to ensure no one is left behind in the bungalows under water in Rhyl, north Wales. Teams used two RNLI flood rescue boats, manned by volunteers from the local area, for the evacuation of 25 residents and six dogs, which has now been completed. Denbighshire County Council said there was some concern for 74 properties on West Parade, Rhyl, between Butterton Road and Sydenham Avenue. North Wales Police said in a statement: Residents are being urged to monitor emergency services messages online, on radio and television for the latest information. As of 2pm people living or working in properties in the Greenfield to Bagillt and the Point of Ayr areas of Flintshire have been advised to evacuate and a rest centre has been opened by Flintshire County Council at Holywell Leisure Centre. Properties in Garford Road, Rhyl, have been flooded and residents evacuated to Rhyl Leisure Centre where a rest centre has been set up by Denbighshire County Council. Sky News is reporting from Rhyl, where homes have been flooded. \"The water's still rising,\" the reporter said. \"You can see why the police are trying to get people to leave this area.\" Norfolk Police are urging residents in 9,000 homes in Great Yarmouth to prepare to leave. It says where possible people should make arrangements to stay with friends or relatives who do not live in affected areas. Norfolk\u2019s Deputy Chief Constable Charlie Hall, who is leading the multi-agency response, said: \"This is a significant policing operation underlined by the number of people and properties affected over the next two days. \"We understand people may be anxious, but we would like to reassure residents that Norfolk has tried and tested flood response plans which are being put in place, in line with Environment Agency advice. \"Such disruptions are entirely necessary to ensure the safety of everyone involved and for the evacuation to be conducted in a planned and organised manner.\u201d Residents of Sandwich in Kent have been told to get ready to evacuate their homes. The Environment Agency sent residents an email topped with this stark heading: \"Severe Flooding. Danger to life.\" It said: High tides on Friday 6 December will cause dangerously high water levels which will flood properties in this Flood Warning Area. This poses a serious risk for both high tides on Friday. Our staff are working to minimise the impacts. Water levels may be high before the predicted astronomical tidal peak. This is because the surge is raising water levels before the peak of the astronomical tide and are likely to overtop some flood defences in the area. Act now to protect yourself, family, neighbours, pets and valuables. You may experience power cuts and loss of services. Stay in a high place with a means of escape. Be ready should you need to evacuate from your home. Co-operate with the emergency services and call 999 if you are in immediate danger. On land and sea and foam... More evacuation news, this time from Suffolk. PA reports: More than 1,000 homes in Suffolk are to be evacuated ahead of tonight's tidal surge. Suffolk County Council said where possible, people living in areas that have been issued severe flood warnings should make arrangements to stay with family or friends outside of the affected areas. The authority is also arranging emergency accommodation in sports and village halls for people who have no alternative place to stay. Police in the region are in the process of visiting properties in the affected areas asking people to leave their homes. Officers have also anticipated that a number of roads in the region will be closed later today due to flooding. Meanwhile, down the coast Colm O'Laoi tweets the scene in Brightlingsea. Glasgow Police catch on to the trampoline meme. Environment secretary Owen Paterson has urged the public to keep up to date with flood warnings from the Environment Agency, after a chairing a meeting of the government's emergency committee. Speaking to BBC News he said: The purpose of the meeting was to make sure that all of the preparations - which we have well in advance - will work together to benefit the public. \"I would urge everybody to pay close attention to announcements by the Environment Agency, the Department for Transport and local government. \"In some areas of Norfolk, where evacuations have commenced, I would urge everybody to work closely and to cooperate with the local authorities.\" He said he would chair a further Cobra meeting this afternoon. Peter Walker is in Sandwich on the Kent coast to observe the flood preparations there. Rail services between Edinburgh and Glasgow and Edinburgh and North Berwick resumed at around 1.30pm, according to ScotRail. A spokesman said other routes would gradually resume when Network Rail declared lines safe and free of debris. Meanwhile, there's a big clean up operation underway to clear the storm damage. The Avante-Garde bar in Glasgow's Merchant City is one of many properties to have been hit, according to Owen Duffy. Owen Duffy in Glasgow has been speaking to frustrated stranded railway passengers. He writes: Rail services in Scotland remain cancelled as workers attempt to clear debris from lines. At Glasgow's Queen Street station - the city's main link to Edinburgh and the north of England - passengers said they'd been forced to make alternative arrangements or postpone their journeys. The storm had earlier forced train operator Scotrail to halt trains at stations, stranding passengers in mid-journey. A spokesman said the company had attempted to help passengers with their onward travel. He said: \"We've had to bring trains into stations and we have tried to ensure that passenders on those trains are as comfortable as possible. We've been giving them teas and coffees and trying to help them complete their journey by taxi wherever possible. \"We have tried to provide alternative transport, but that's difficult today because obviously the road networks are also being affected by the weather.\" Glasgow Central station was evacuated this morning when flying debris shattered part of the building's glass roof. No one was injured in the incident, and the station has just re-opened to the public. Around 3,700 homes are without electricity in Northern Ireland due to the storms, writes Henry McDonald. Northern Ireland Electricity has said it has opened a number of regional centres to help its consumers left without power. \"We've been liaising with the Met Office for the past couple of days,\" said Northern Ireland Electricity's (NIE) Julia Carson. \"We knew this was coming and we have additional engineers, emergency crews and call handlers on standby.\" The strong winds have also forced the temporary closure of the Christmas market in the grounds of Belfast City Hall while safety checks take place. Meanwhile a number of flights have been diverted from George Best City Airport in Belfast to the International Airport as a result of the strong winds. Ferries across the Irish Sea between Larne and Cairnryan in Scotland were disrupted while the ferry from North Antrim coast to Rathlin Island has been cancelled. The storms caused flooding in the promenade at Porstewart on the north coast with a children's playground submerged in water. And the rail link between Derry and Belfast, as well as Larne, suffered disruption after debris caused by the storms was scattered over railway lines. Here's a summary of the main developments so far: \u2022A lorry driver was killed in West Lothian when his HGV toppled onto a number of cars as high winds and gales battered Scotland. Four other people were injured when the lorry overturned on the A801. \u2022 The Scottish railway network has been closed because of a high level of storm debris on the tracks. The debris included fallen trees, damaged power lines, hay bales, and a trampoline on the line. Glasgow station was forced to closed after storm damage to its roof. \u2022 Power has been restored to 28,000 homes in Scotland, but 22,000 homes remain without electricity after winds of 100mph caused widespread damage. The Met Office recorded a record wind speed of 142mph in Inverness overnight. \u2022 Thousands of people on the east coast of England and on the Welsh coast have been told to evacuate their homes over fears that a combination of storms and high tides could lead to flood levels that will endanger lives. Evacuation warnings have been issued to homes in villages in Norfolk, Essex, Kent and Flintshire in Wales. \u2022 The Environment Agency has warned that the east coast could face the worst flood in more than 60 years. In some areas sea levels could be higher than those during the devastating floods of 1953, but defences built since then - including the Thames and Hull barriers - mean that many parts of the country are much better protected. \u2022 The environment secretary Owen Paterson has chaired a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee to discuss the response to the storm. So far the Environment Agency has issued more than 200 flood alerts across England and Wales. A spokesman said that in the \"worst case scenario\" 6,000 properties could be flooded. \u2022 The storm has created widespread travel disruption including the closure of major roads and bridges and the cancellation of a number of flights. Transport Scotland escalated its travel warning to stage four red, advising people to avoid travelling, particularly in high-sided vehicles. Environment secretary Owen Paterson has chaired a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee to discuss the response to the storm. In a message on Twitter this morning the Prime Minister said: \"I've asked Environment Secretary Owen Paterson to chair a Cobra this morning on the storm disruption - ensuring everything is being done.\" So far the EA has issued more than 200 flood alerts across England and Wales, a spokesman said that in the \"worst case scenario\" 6,000 properties could be flooded. A spokesman said in some areas sea levels could be higher than those during the devastating floods of 1953, but defences built since then - including the Thames and Hull barriers - mean that many parts of the country are much better protected. Anne Edwards, editor of the Great Yarmouth Mercury, was one of those told to leave their homes tonight, but is determined to ride out the storm with sandbags and supplies, PA reports. She was awoken by an alert call from the Environment Agency at 6.30am, warning of severe flooding in the area of her home, which is a mile from the coast. Edwards, who believes hundreds of homes are being evacuated, said: \"We're staying put. The house we live in was flooded in 1953 and there's a four-and-a-half foot-high water line in the dining room from then. We always knew we might be at risk of flooding, so there is a camping stove upstairs and we have water and cans of food. \"If it's going to happen, it's going to happen. We can go upstairs, it's not going to kill us.\" She said she went into a \"mad panic\" at receiving the automated call this morning and hunted for her home insurance policy. Her husband has bought sandbags and the couple have containers ready to fill with fresh water. She said: \"I'm going to get the paper out then go home for dinner, but then I'll be back in the office later. I've got my wellies ready.\" Yet more homes are being evacuated, this time in Essex. Essex Police said that parts of Jaywick, a small seaside village near Clacton, will be evacuated. It issued this statement: Residents who may be evacuated are being encouraged to pack essential belongings and stay overnight with friends and relatives where possible. In the event that residents are not able to stay with friends and relatives they can go to evacuation assembly points from where they will be transported to a suitable rest centre, where they can take shelter overnight. More residents are being urged to evacuate their homes. Warnings to abandon homes have been issued in Wells, on the north Norfolk coast, and Flintshire on the Welsh coast. At last, Network Rail Scotland has photographic proof of that trampoline on the line. Anton McCoy notes: Homes in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, are being evacuated after officials warned that the lives of people in the town could be at risk from flooding. The Environment Agency has issued three severe flood warnings for parts of the seaside town - the highest category, warning of danger to life. The local paper says up to 9,000 homes are at risk. The Met Office currently has 219 flood warnings, though their severity differs across the country, writes Mona Chalabi. Two of the flood warnings or alerts issued have been removed in the last 24 hours. Another 72 only call for flood preparedness (a more regular weather warning) while 25 mention the risk of danger to live. Transport Scotland has escalated its travel warning to stage four red, advising people to avoid travelling, particularly in high-sided vehicles. The warning came after a lorry driver was killed in West Lothian. Four injured people were treated for minor injuries, police said. Closures, fallen trees, minor accidents and incidents of flash flooding are affecting the road network in the south, west, central and Perthshire areas. In the Highlands, gusts of 93mph have been recorded at Altnaharra, rising to 106mph at Glen Ogle and 114mph on the slopes of Aonach Mor near Fort William. A user of the GuardianWitness app has uploaded pictures of a closure on Scotland's M74. Historic data from the Met Office shows the windspeed recorded overnight in Inverness have only been recorded once before, in the UK, writes Mona Chalabi. The highest recorded was in Fraserburgh, Scotland in February 1989, at 123 knots, or 142 miles per hour. Wales and Northern Ireland both had 108 knots (124 mph) as their fastest ever wind speeds. To see the fastest winds by their full location, use the interactive map below. The highest windspeed recorded by the Met Office overnight was 142mph in Inverness. It said: As forecast, there have been severe gales with widespread gusts of between 60 and 80mph across Scotland and northern parts of England. Some very high level mountain sites have reported speeds of over 140mph, but these are in very exposed areas and not representative of the winds most people are experiencing. Winds will continue to be strong through to this afternoon, and we will update with more wind speeds later today. Network Rail Scotland tweets images of some the storm damage that has forced the closure of the network. But no pictures just yet of trampolines on the line. Scottish Hydro Electric said up to 80,000 homes are without power across the north of Scotland, PA reports. The worst affected areas are in the Highlands, Tayside and Argyll, with road blockages affecting work to restore the supply. The number of properties affected is expected to rise during the day as winds move across from west to east, the company said. It has mobilised 1,000 engineers and support staff and expects the majority of supplies to be restored later today. A further 20,000 properties have been cut off in central and southern Scotland, Scottish Power said. In Lanarkshire more than 7,000 homes are affected, in Ayrshire over 3,000 and in the Lothians more than 3,000. Uprooted trees and other debris have been blown on to overhead power lines, causing damage and bringing down the lines in some areas. The company said around 500 staff are working to fix the faults, including extra engineers drafted in from England. Please contribute your photos and videos of the effects of the gales, floods and snow via GuardianWitness. But please don't put your safety at risk. A lorry driver has died in West Lothian after his HGV toppled onto a number of cars as high winds and gales battered Scotland, PA reports citing the police. Four other people were injured when the lorry overturned on to a number of cars on the A801 one mile north of Boghead Roundabout, Bathgate, West Lothian, at around 8.10am. More details as we get them ... British Airways has been forced to cancel some flights to Scotland and northern England due to the weather. In a statement it said: As a result of the severe weather in Scotland and the north of England we are experiencing some disruption to our domestic schedule. \"We are doing all we can to help customers and will rebook them on to later flights. We will also look to use larger aircraft to help fly delayed customers later in the day. The AA's specialist severe weather team, AA Special Operations, was being deployed in North Wales, Scotland and eastern England coastal locations, PA reports.
