Now that my son Aidan knows I'm gay \u2013 or more precisely, now that I know he knows I'm gay \u2013 I ponder how best to have the same conversation with Ed. He is younger and a little more introverted than Aidan; whereas the latter wears his heart on his sleeve, his little brother is a tad more cautious. Apparently, they'd debated whether I was gay or not a while back but, according to Aidan, not in much detail. And, as vague as ever, he can't remember what Ed's take on it was. I walk home that afternoon and spot Ed in my ex-wife's kitchen. I knock on the door and he lets me in; his mum has gone to Bikram yoga. \"What's up?\" I ask. \"Nothing much,\" says Ed. \"Except I'm starving and there isn't any food.\" He's sitting at the table looking at a Domino's Pizza menu. \"I had lunch with Aidan earlier; you were still in bed.\" \"Yeah, sorry, I was knackered. I was on my Xbox to really late last night.\" I can tell. His eyes have that slightly bloodshot, glazed look he gets when he's spent too long staring at hand-propelled skateboarders falling down stairwells. \"Please don't spend too long on that. I don't want to have to take it away again.\" \"I know; I won't. Just last night.\" \"Aidan and I had a good talk today\u2026 about Simon.\" \"Cool! Can you order me a pizza?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
