Pevenage is a grizzled, stocky little Belgian, with close-cropped white hair above a banana-shaped grin. Twenty years ago he was a Tour man himself, the winner of a cold, soaking stage in the 1980 race. In recent years, as manager of the Deutsche Telekom team, he and his protege Jan Ullrich have faced the Sisyphean task of trying to engineer Armstrong's downfall. On Tuesday July 17, Pevenage was driving close behind the front group of Tour cyclists with the other team managers in their little flotilla of Fiat Marea estates with spare bikes and giant radio aerials on their roofs and gaudy team stickers on the sides. As they negotiated the corridors of cheering fans on the hairpins among the oak woods and rock outcrops of the Col du Glandon in the Alps, he realised something strange was happening a few metres ahead among the group of 30 or so cyclists - with Armstrong, for once, well towards the rear. \"As riders were left behind by the group I would overtake them, and some of them were telling me Armstrong was not looking good, that he was not OK,\" he recalls. All team cars on the Tour are fitted with miniature televisions: Pevenage could hear the French commentators saying the same thing: \"Armstrong en difficult\u00e9\". Armstrong in trouble. A little grimace on Armstrong's usually expressionless face, a little shake in his shoulders in the blue jersey, the fact that he was not riding right at the front: it all indicated that the man who had won the Tour for the previous two years by flying up the mountains was struggling. A commentator on a motorbike dropped back to ask the Texan's team manager Johan Bruyneel what was going on. With carefully chosen words, Bruyneel stirred the waters: \"I don't know if he's good or bad. I can see the picture like you, and it doesn't say anything good to me.\" Every time Pevenage saw the group as they went round a hairpin he could see the recovered cancer sufferer just ahead, hanging on to the back of the group with his Spanish team-mates in US Postal, Roberto Heras and Jose Luis Rubiera. He looked like a man clinging on for dear life. One or two of Armstrong's fellow competitors gave him little pushes of encouragement. What was wrong with the favourite? No one knew. But Ullrich - at the head of the leading group - and Pevenage had to find out, so the manager spoke by radio to his team's strongest mountain climbers, the American Kevin Livingston and the Italian Giuseppe Guerini. Through the little earpieces linked to minute receivers in their jersey pockets, he told them to make the hottest pace they could. If Armstrong was struggling he would be left behind. If they did not try they would never find out. Pevenage knew the attempt to burn Armstrong off might prove to be a lost cause. \"I didn't believe this cinema,\" he recalls. \"I knew he [Armstrong] was joking; Jan knew it also. He was pretending, and I said so to Jan. Our riders made the tempo because Janni asked me. What else could we do?\" Rubiera, the Texan's domestique, was also puzzled. \"Heras and I were with Lance. We wanted to go to the front, but he told us to keep calm, that everything was fine. I was amazed by how cold and detached he could be.\" The first mountain stage in any Tour de France is a key moment. The opening 10 days or so of racing on the flat are a phoney, if strength-sapping, war; the favourites bide their time, knowing the race will take shape only when they reach the Alps or the Pyrenees. The first mountains invariably weed out the weak, setting the pattern for the rest of the race. Thus Armstrong's beleaguered appearance seemed to confirm the widespread impression that, on this Tour, the American was not having things all his own way. During the team time-trial stage two of his team-mates had crashed and his key climbing assistant Christian van de Velde had pulled out. On the mountain pass before the Glandon, the Col de la Madeleine, all his team apart from Heras and Rubiera had been unable to hold the pace. If the Texan really was having a bad day he would have little support. This background doubled the impact in the Texan's knockout punch, delivered with clinical precision 40 minutes later at the foot of the day's third and final mountain: l'Alpe d'Huez. As the race reached the chalets of Bourg d'Oisans, in the valley 3,000 feet below the ski resort, Pevenage's fears were realised: Armstrong had been acting. \"He was at the back of the group on the Glandon, but I could see he was OK when we got to the bottom of Alpe d'Huez because he had moved to the front. If he had been bad he would still have been at the back. Rubiera and Heras were with him and I knew what they would do. I said to Jan: 'Watch out. Armstrong will attack twice; first to see whether you react, the second time 100%.'\" There is no gentle run-in to l'Alpe d'Huez: from the valley floor the road suddenly rears up the mountainside in 1-in-9 ramps between the hairpin bends cut into the cliff-face. For the first time that day, Armstrong took the initiative. \"Lance told me to drive like hell,\" says Rubiera. It was a classic tactic: the team-mate sets the initial pace, then the leader deals with those who are left. With Armstrong at his shoulder the little Spaniard pushed hard, and within a few seconds only Ullrich and the Kazakh Andrei Kivilev were clinging on. Then came Armstrong's attack. In British cycling slang it was a \"double shuffle\" - an acceleration, a look back to check the opposition, then the coup de grace. The Texan stamped on the pedals, glanced back at Ullrich, saw him floundering, and stamped again - harder. With his face set, he disappeared up the mountain. Eight miles of climbing later, Ullrich was two minutes behind. After the stage, Armstrong admitted he had been playing mind games. \"Everyone can see everything, because of the television cameras. Sometimes you have to go along with that. I played poker with Telekom, and I won.\" The Tour was as good as over. No one had expected Armstrong to perform this well. \"Jan was convinced he was OK, perhaps he thought he would lose 30 seconds, never two minutes,\" says Pevenage. Ullrich and Telekom's hopes were shattered. \"We couldn't believe what we saw,\" says the team's oldest domestique, Udo B\u00f6lts. \"When we saw the way he attacked, we all lost morale. The team directors tried to hold up our motivation, but when you saw how easy it was for him you had to be realistic. To have a little chance we needed Armstrong to have a bad day, but he never looked like it.\" With three Tour wins in a row under his belt Armstrong now has an impregnable aura. B\u00f6lts insists, \"Winning the Tour next year is not done and dusted for him,\" but his manager, Pevenage, feels the opposite: \"If next year Armstrong is stronger than this year, I don't know who can beat him or how we could do it. We've tried everything. If you know the answer, please tell me.\" What happened next ... Lance Armstrong went on to win the Tour, joining the select group of cyclists who have won the race three times and the even more select bunch - Louison Bobet, Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx and Miguel Indurain - who have won a hat-trick. Udo B\u00f6lts, who rode against both men, maintains that Armstrong is not as impregnable as Indurain. \"It seemed as if Indurain could win six or seven Tours, he looked untouchable. Armstrong will start as favourite in the next two but it will be hard for him to win five. Indurain seemed like he was on another planet, and Armstrong seems that way too, but a lot of riders are hungry to beat him; in Indurain's time nobody could take him on.\" With his wife Kristin expecting twins, Armstrong rode his last race of the year in early September. His third Tour victory merely cemented his status as all-American hero. In the United States his defeat of testicular cancer has always been seen as uniquely life-affirming, something confirmed after the September 11 disaster when the American Red Cross invited him to visit Ground Zero to raise morale. During his 36 hours there he met volunteers and firemen, addressed rescue workers to a standing ovation and at one station, Bowery 33, actually raced two firemen on their old bikes. The autumn held other significant events: five years after Armstrong was diagnosed with cancer he was declared completely clear of the condition and on November 21 his wife gave birth by Caesarean section to daughters Isabelle and Grace. Like their son Luke the twins were conceived from sperm which Armstrong donated before his illness. There remain two shadows over the Texan. A judicial inquiry in France into alleged use of banned substances by his team continues and should be concluded by March. The trainer Michele Ferrari, with whom Armstrong has been associated, went on trial last week for allegedly providing drugs to top cyclists, not including Armstrong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
