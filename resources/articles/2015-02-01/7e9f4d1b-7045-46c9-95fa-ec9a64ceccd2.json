Barring accidents, Robshaw will lead his country into the tournament this autumn with Lancaster having decided the Harlequins flanker is the right choice for the high-profile job. Robshaw has captained England throughout Lancaster\u2019s tenure but has only been reappointed on a tournament-by-tournament basis. The coaches, however, were hugely impressed by his input in Cardiff, on the field and immediately prior to the game, when he refused to be pressurised into leading his team from the tunnel to the pitch before Wales had left their dressing room. While much can still change in terms of form and fitness between now and September, Lancaster has made it clear he believes the 28-year-old is now an automatic pick, regardless of the increasing competition for places in England\u2019s back-row. \u201cIt would take a big change of heart now to move from the direction we\u2019re going with Chris,\u201d Lancaster said. \u201cHe has been excellent and we need to make sure we continue to back him. We certainly will in this Six Nations and, fingers crossed, he\u2019ll be fit and available for the start of the World Cup camp in June.\u201d Robshaw was once again influential against the Welsh, putting in 26 tackles and playing a key role in his side\u2019s hugely effective second-half performance. \u201cConfidence in his ability as a player is the fundamental thing behind leadership,\u201d Lancaster said. \u201cHe\u2019s secure in his position in the team but he\u2019s earned it. He did it again against Wales with the number of tackles and turnovers he made and his contribution to the game. We look at people\u2019s involvement, not just in the rucks but in their work-rate off the ball. He\u2019s continually at the top of that as well. He\u2019s earned the respect of all the players and as a consequence he\u2019s leading them effectively.\u201d England do have a widening leadership circle but Lancaster clearly feels Robshaw has matured into a more decisive, stronger captain than he was in his fledgling Test years. The tunnel episode was merely one example of it and the coaches reckon it set a collective tone. \u201cAs a group we have grown,\u201d Lancaster added. \u201cIt\u2019s less about the tunnel and more about playing hard on the field. You want to show what you are about as a group. There is a fine line but I\u2019d hate to think we come across as an arrogant team. I\u2019d like to think there was no arrogance but a confidence growing. \u201cOur strength is in the collective. Chris represents the collective, which is great, he does it brilliantly. But he\u2019s now backed up by some pretty strong foot soldiers which is what we want. If you go back to the 2003 team you had Martin Johnson as captain but there was also Dallaglio, Back, Hill and guys in the same category. I\u2019d like to think we have that type of group growing together. There are a lot of players in the changing room who have now played in big games, particularly in the forwards. That investment in the last two to three years is beginning to tell.\u201d England\u2019s luck also appears to be changing, with no fresh injury concerns before Italy\u2019s visit to Twickenham. It would seem almost certain that Lancaster will opt for an unchanged line-up, but Geoff Parling, Brad Barritt and Kyle Eastmond are all due to return to contact work in the next 24 hours or so. Tom Wood and Courtney Lawes, however, are unlikely to play any rugby before the weekend England face Ireland in Dublin at the start of March and it remains extremely unlikely that Leicester\u2019s Manu Tuilagi will be seen in this championship. The Bath prop David Wilson is also the subject of some concern, full power having not yet returned to his arm after he damaged a nerve in his neck. \u201cHis pain\u2019s gone but his strength hasn\u2019t quite returned,\u201d Lancaster said. \u201cSometimes these things can take two weeks, sometimes they can take longer. Hopefully it\u2019ll be sooner rather than later but it\u2019s hard to tell.\u201d Nobody connected with England, however, is being allowed to rest for long on the Friday-night laurels they earned in Cardiff. \u201cWe are pleased but, ultimately, we are only one step towards our goal which is not to come second in the championship again,\u201d Lancaster added. \u201cWe have to make sure we back up our performance and get our detail right. One point we have made to the players is that your belief comes from the foundations you build during the week, so there will be no letting off. \u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go in the championship, but it\u2019s certainly easier to move on from an away win, particularly in the context of the game and how we played. What is nice is to have a win in a difficult situation to confirm to the players that we are heading in the right direction. We\u2019re all pleased but ultimately we know we\u2019ve got a bigger goal to aim for.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
