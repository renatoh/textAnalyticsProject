Sterling\u2019s 71st-minute winner on Sunday was his first goal since September and delivered a much-needed fillip for Guardiola\u2019s side heading into the festive programme, moving them above Arsenal although still seven points behind the leaders, Chelsea. Sterling, much like Guardiola and City, had started the season well, with five goals in his opening nine games, only for his form to dip in the past two months. The 22-year-old admitted some guidance from his latest manager had helped. \u201cHe has told me to be direct, to be the player he knows I want to be,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cTo be direct, to be involved in creating chances and scoring goals, being clinical and that\u2019s what I need to do. \u201cI watch players to get better. I\u2019m only 22 and I\u2019m going to watch world-class players to see if I can improve my game week in, week out. There\u2019s many players in my position I watch, and to keep adding to my game. \u201cI know I can still get better. It\u2019s about me enjoying my football, learning each day at training. I just need to show it on the pitch. I can\u2019t keep talking about it but have to do it. I need to express myself and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do.\u201d Sunday\u2019s win was City\u2019s second victory in five days after the more prosaic 2-0 success over Watford, which had come on the back of the damaging defeats at Leicester and at home to Chelsea. \u201cWe had a bad run of games, lost a few games, but this is the Premier League and you pay for it when you are not at your best,\u201d said Sterling. \u201cWe are a few points behind Chelsea but we will keep trying to win our matches and hopefully keep up with them. You have to keep your eye on everyone and can\u2019t think you are ever comfortable where you are in the league. Things can turn so quickly. They might get a bad run and we can go on a run \u2013 we are capable of that \u2013 and that\u2019s what makes the Premier League so fantastic.\u201d The equaliser on Sunday came from Leroy San\u00e9, his first goal for the club, and Sterling said he believed the 20-year-old summer signing from Schalke could now show his true talent for City. \u201cFor him, not starting at the beginning of the season does not help but he\u2019s getting back into it now and I\u2019m really happy for him. Hopefully he can now kick on. \u201cFunnily enough before the game I said to him if I had a shot like you I\u2019d be shooting every minute and no one would be able to take the ball off me. I said if you get a chance, just shoot and he got his goal so I\u2019m really pleased for him. He\u2019s a great lad and been working really hard. \u201cAt the start of the season he probably wasn\u2019t playing as much as he wanted. But in the Premier League you have to adapt and get used to it. We\u2019ve got [lots of] players in all departments and the manager is looking to put young players in and it\u2019s up to us to take our chances when we get them. Leroy has done brilliantly. He was a threat all game. He will get better and so will the team.\u201d After two home games City face trips to Hull on Boxing Day and then to Sterling\u2019s former club, Liverpool, on New Year\u2019s Eve, before Burnley\u2019s visit to the Etihad on 2 January. \u201cI\u2019m massively excited about this season and what we can achieve,\u201d said Sterling. \u201cOf course we want the title, to do well in the Champions League. We have a good draw [Monaco]; it\u2019s always a tough game but we have a chance to go through. It\u2019s exciting times ahead and we just need to keep going.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
