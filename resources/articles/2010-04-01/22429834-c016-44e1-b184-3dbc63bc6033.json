Until recently, that is, when designers began sending models down the runway dressed as if they were heading for a night out at the local goth club, at least in terms of colour. One fashion magazine suggested that dressing all in black \"communicates authority\", which seems a bit of a sweeping statement. I'm not 100% convinced that the balding guy in your local video shop with the leather trenchcoat and the clompy boots communicates anything much by his choice of colourway, beyond the fact that he hasn't had it off in recent memory, but let us not be too hasty in our dismissal of head-to-toe black as a male fashion decision. It's slimming. It's a distinct improvement in the dignity stakes on fashion's recent obsession with getting men to dress in vibrant primary colours, a look that mainly seemed to communicate that you were after a job on children's television. But the final point in its favour may be the most crucial, given the average heterosexual male's unerring ability to carry on as if deciding what to wear is akin to an unexpectedly large tax bill: an insurmountable obstacle you'll eventually have to face but would rather think about as little as possible. It makes dressing easier, by the simple expedient of narrowing down your choices. \u2022 Alexis wears jacket, \u00a3195, and boots, \u00a3155, both by All Saints, allsaints.co.uk.
