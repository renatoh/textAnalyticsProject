It is not a skill I\u2019m proud of; it\u2019s not even a good party trick. It is a product of mental illness, one that I have battled with since childhood, which eventually got me admitted to an eating disorders unit at the age of 31. This week, students sitting a GCSE maths exam were asked the question: \u201cThere are 84 calories in 100g of banana. There are 87 calories in 100g of yogurt. Priti has 60g of banana and 150g of yogurt for breakfast. Work out the total number of calories in this breakfast.\u201d Some students had to leave the exam. They were right to do so, because when you suffer from an eating disorder, this is not a maths exercise \u2013 it is your life. One woman I was in hospital with, who had spent a year on a ward after being sectioned and tube-fed, put it perfectly: \u201cMy head is a calculator.\u201d I understand the logic here. This is, after all, a question about numbers, and calories are units of measurement. However, nuance is needed. A topic that can be extraordinarily damaging for some people to engage in, that of calories and eating and diet, is much better served in the context of mental and physical health, not as a bare maths question. Anyone with an eating disorder would have already been too preoccupied by food to focus during this exam. They might, like me, have been terrified to realise they had more for breakfast than Priti that morning. They might have restricted their food intake afterwards, or started counting calories or weight or begun to measure their body parts. They might have binged and purged or both. They might have engaged in all kinds of disordered behaviour because that is what your life is like when you are unwell: you live on a tightrope, ready to fall off. This may sound wild if you have not experienced an eating disorder. But therein is the madness: there is no reason, no sanity, to it. And very often, with apps such as MyFitnessPal that will do all the counting for you, there is no escape from it. People who suffer from eating disorders do not conform to any body weight, shape, size or gender. What we have in common are debilitating internal voices that tell us not to eat, that we are not enough, that we are not safe in this world. It is these thoughts that make us do odd things such as take kitchen scales on holiday to weigh portions, and to cry, crippled with guilt, after every mouthful. They are the voices that keep us up at night and drag us the next day, exhausted, to exercise, where we count some more, hoping to compensate for what we\u2019ve consumed. To put a question about calorie counting in an exam shows nothing but profound ignorance of this deadly illness. Pearson Edexcel, the exam board that set the question, says it is \u201cvalid\u201d. That does not make it right. Trying to recover from an eating disorder in a world that only rewards restriction is torturous enough. At the very least, exams should be free from these calculations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
