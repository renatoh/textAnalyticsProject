We\u2019re here, the final stretch of the campaign. The country will go to the polls on Thursday, but before that happens, the parties are giving their pitches one final push. We also have the best of non-election news from around the country and the world. What\u2019s going on? The Labour party will be focusing on the benefit of its policies to the bank balances of voters, promising the public that a Labour government would put \u201cmoney in your pocket\u201d.

At the odder end of the spectrum is Johnson\u2019s claim that getting Brexit done will lead to a baby boom such as the one that he wrongly alleges occurred after the London Olympics. Despite these issues, the Conservatives\u2019 message that they will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d seems to have cut through and they still look strongly placed to win the election.

John McDonnell will give a speech in London this morning on Labour\u2019s plans for its first 100 days in government, while party leader Jeremy Corbyn will be campaigning in the south-west of England. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Sir Ed Davey will be canvassing in Guildford. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will take part in a photocall in Coatbridge, then join her party\u2019s candidate for Lanark and Hamilton East on a visit to the Wallace tea rooms where they will help bake a cake.
