Top stories Women who were treated in Taree by the disgraced gynaecologist Dr Emil Shawky Gayed have come forward with horrifying stories of their experiences, exposing a culture of silence and the failure of the health system to respond to warnings about his practices. Gayed performed surgeries on women that they later found out were unnecessary, such as hysterectomies, fallopian tube removal and the removal of uterine tissue. They would wake up from surgery in agony and suddenly in menopause, their reproductive organs missing. One woman, Rhiannon Tull, felt a chill when she found out her gynaecologist was Gayed, because of his reputation in the town on the mid-north coast of NSW. Tull says she was \u201cpetrified\u201d when she needed an emergency caesarean and Gayed was the obstetrician on duty. She nearly died on the operating table. But Gayed never told her that, nor why she lost so much blood and needed a transfusion. Tull found out she nearly died only months later by chance, from a nurse at the hospital. The stories of Gayed\u2019s failures are graphic and distressing, raising troubling questions about how they were allowed to continue unchecked for as long as 15 years. Donald Trump has called for the US to abandon its judicial system and summarily deport people who enter the country, in a string of tweets on Sunday. The president said US immigration policy was \u201claughed at all over the world\u201d and it could not allow \u201call of these people to invade our country\u201d. \u201cWhen somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came,\u201d Trump wrote. The statement amounted to a proposal for the suspension of law by the country\u2019s chief law enforcement officer. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has claimed victory in Turkey\u2019s presidential election but the opposition has not conceded defeat, as not all ballots have been counted. \u201cThe Turkish public has mandated me as president according to unofficial results,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said. \u201cI hope nobody will damage democracy by casting a shadow on this election and its results to hide their failure.\u201d The Anadolu Agency reported that with 95.5% of votes counted, Erdo\u011fan had won 52.72% of the national vote, while the CHP party\u2019s candidate, Muharrem \u0130nce, was on 30.75%. The results, if they stand, will disappoint the opposition, which mounted a dynamic election campaign that hoped to push Erdo\u011fan into a second-round run-off against \u0130nce. The automation of Centrelink is \u201cdeliberately designed to make it hard for people\u201d, according to a new report from Anglicare Australia. The agency\u2019s social workers now spend so long helping clients with Centrelink they are devoting the equivalent of 343.2 full-time employees across the country \u2013 13,041 hours a week \u2013 just to help clients navigate the system. \u201cThe more vulnerable you are, the more likely it is that you have quite a complex issue,\u201d said Kasy Chambers, Anglicare\u2019s executive director. \u201cWhen you have a number of issues, that\u2019s when it\u2019s really difficult to interact with an automated system. \u2026 There are times when all of us would have a question too complex for a computer.\u201d Just 5% of Australians \u201cbelieve they have personally gained a lot\u201d from 26 years of consecutive economic growth, a national poll has found, compared with 40% who said they had \u201cgained a little\u201d. Melinda Cilento, chief executive of the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia, which produced the report, said traction for economic change, such as the government\u2019s proposed personal and corporate tax cuts, became more difficult \u201cif the community feels removed from the benefits or have lost trust that the benefits from growth will be broadly shared\u201d. Sport A year on from heartache, NSW seem to have learnt a thing or two about how to win a State of Origin series. This time they didn\u2019t allow the opportunity to slip, defeating Queensland 18-14 in a thrilling game two in Sydney, despite being a man down in the nervy finale. Australia have been humbled again by England in the one-day cricket series, with the unquestionable genius of Jos Buttler\u2019s century securing the home side a one-wicket victory and its first 5-0 whitewash over their historic rivals in any format. England\u2019s sporting stocks are running dangerously high, as their footballers strolled into the World Cup knockout stage by thrashing Panama 6-1. In group H Colombia revived their hopes by beating a dismal Poland 3-0, and will now fight it out for the top places in the group with Japan and Senegal, who drew 2-2. Thinking time The homeless life is a hard, hard slog, writes the Australian author Gregory P Smith, whose memoir, Out of the Forest, revisits his darkest days. \u201cYou\u2019re always hungry, you\u2019re always tired and society always thinks the worst of you.\u201d After 15 years sleeping rough across Australia\u2019s east coast, Smith walked into a rainforest and became a bush-dwelling hermit. He recounts how he finally re-entered society \u2013 and the simple thing everyone can do to make a difference for a homeless person. Saudi women who took to the streets in their cars after the country\u2019s ban on driving was lifted at 12.01 on Sunday were greeted by police officers who gave them flowers, as fathers gave their blessing and locals marked the moment with humour. \u201cI feel free like a bird,\u201d said one new driver, while others showed off cars bought for the occasion. Several women shouted with delight, some cried, and many more took videos of their first forays at the wheel. Free speech derived from uprisings against the wealthy and the privileged \u2013 the kind of people the Institute of Public Affairs and its friends in the Liberal party now represent, writes Jeff Sparrow. He calls the IPA\u2019s version of free speech a doctrine of freedom for corporations and subservience for people. \u201cWithout strong unions, without decent working conditions, without the kind of organisations that might provide a platform for unpopular opinions, our freedom of expression comes a distant second to the rich\u2019s freedom to silence us.\u201d Media roundup Many east coast papers splash with the Blues\u2019 State of Origin victory over Queensland. \u201cBlue Murder\u201d at the Canberra Times, \u201cForever Young\u201d at the Daily Telegraph and an amusing \u201cRare Species Alert\u201d at the Courier-Mail. The Age has an exclusive poll on whether Bill Shorten or Malcolm Turnbull is Australia\u2019s preferred PM. Turnbull is just ahead \u2013 especially on economic policy at 67% \u2013 but Shorten is making steady headway with his social policies. And 65% of respondents believe Shorten has the support of his party, while only 55% believe Turnbull does. An ABC investigation reveals Australia\u2019s largest online doctor\u2019s appointment booking service, HealthEngine, has shared hundreds of users\u2019 medical information with law firms fishing for clients with personal injury claims. Coming up The banking royal commission resumes in Brisbane today, with the focus on regional issues and how the industry has treated farmers. Parliament resumes for the final sitting week before the winter break, with the government intent on pressing the case for its corporate tax cuts.
