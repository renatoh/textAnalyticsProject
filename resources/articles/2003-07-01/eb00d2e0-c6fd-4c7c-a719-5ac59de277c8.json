Saints said they were \"genuinely stunned\" and considering their options, and Hull confirmed that a legal challenge is a possibility. Halifax are left without a point at the bottom of the Super League table after failing to regain the two they earned for their sole win of the season. They refused to comment before today's edition of the Evening Courier, their main sponsor. \"We are absolutely stunned at this because in our own minds we no longer know what the rules are,\" said the Saints chairman Eamonn McManus. \"We are considering the possibility of other remedies.\" Wigan's millionaire owner Dave Whelan has insisted he retains confidence in the club's Australian coach Stuart Raper - but admitted he would not be surprised if Raper returns home at the end of the season. Whelan's appearance on the pitch before last Friday's game against Wakefield, when he gathered the players into a huddle for an impromptu team talk, had fuelled speculation about Raper's position. \"It had nothing whatsoever to do with that,\" said Whelan yesterday. \"All I said was good luck and let's get our credibility back after we'd lost to Huddersfield the week before. That's normal for me - I do it with the football team all the time.\" Asked about Raper's future, Whelan added: \"Stuart is in a situation where he is making his mind up. He's been in England six years and I think he has got an approach to work back in Australia. It isn't a case of Wigan sacking him, I think Stuart will make his mind up.\" Leeds have given a one-year contract extension to David Furner, the 33-year-old Australian forward who joined them from Wigan last winter. Leeds's chief executive Gary Hetherington also confirmed yesterday that Liam Botham is set to move to Headingley from Newcastle Falcons on a cross-code contract, although mainly for the club's rugby union operation. Bradford Bulls decided not to sign the wing after trials because of salary-cap restrictions. Queensland avoided a whitewash in the State of Origin series in Brisbane yesterday by romping to a 36-6 victory over New South Wales."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
