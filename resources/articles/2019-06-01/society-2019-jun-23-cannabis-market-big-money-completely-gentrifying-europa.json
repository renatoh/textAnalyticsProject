Missing from the gathering will be many of those who smoke the drug, take it as an oil for their ailments or have felt the force of the law over cannabis prohibition. Widening access to medical cannabis for patients, and how to go about it, will be central to the discussion at Cannabis Europa, the conference at the heart of European Cannabis Week. Since legalisation in the UK in June last year, there has not been one reported NHS prescription for full-extract cannabis oil, because of reluctance within the medical establishment. Nonetheless, a private market has emerged to service dozens if not hundreds of wealthy patients, prompting outrage among campaigners. Figures you would usually associate with politics will stroll through the venues, such as the founder of industry body the Centre for Medicinal Cannabis (CMC), Steve Moore \u2013 a former David Cameron insider \u2013 and its policy lead Blair Gibbs, once an adviser to Boris Johnson as mayor of London. They are considered interlopers by seasoned cannabis activists, and are often the object of their anger on social media. The founder of the Guido Fawkes political website, Paul Staines, who provides public affairs advice to the CMC, may also be in attendance, while the Spectator\u2019s chairman, Andrew Neil, will chair a talk featuring Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb and Tory MP Crispin Blunt, who recently founded the new Conservative drug policy reform group. It has registered as a limited company with two directors from the Canadian recreational cannabis companies Supreme and Wayland, as accusations abound that the medical debate is something of a Trojan horse for multinationals jostling over future control of the UK\u2019s multibillion-pound illicit cannabis market. Few of the attendees will be stoners and adult patients, and many longtime campaigners who have risked the wrath of the law to supply patients are aggrieved they are being sidelined from what they see as top-down reform dictated by big business \u2013 often funded by tobacco money. Greg de Hoedt \u2013 who vapes cannabis to manage symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease, which doctors said in 2010 would kill him within five years \u2013 founded the UK Cannabis Social Clubs in 2011 to provide safe spaces for patients and recreational users. He remains sceptical over the recent influx of cannabis entrepreneurs. He believes the establishment has hijacked cannabis, and fears that a future recreational cannabis market dominated by corporate interests may lobby against the right for people to grow their own. \u201cIf they were in it for helping people, where were they 10 years ago when we were banging the drum?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely concerning seeing these hard-right figures trying to get involved with cannabis. They\u2019re completely gentrifying it by attempting to persuade lawmakers that homegrown cannabis is unsafe. \u201cI fear we\u2019re going to end up with a commercial cannabis market before people get the right to grow. They care about profit, not the people.\u201d However, the policymakers say the traditional campaigners had no plan, and that the politicisation and commercialisation of cannabis is an inevitable consequence of reform. \u201cThey weren\u2019t prepared to deal with this coming,\u201d says Moore, who was chief executive of Cameron\u2019s ill-fated \u201cbig society\u201d initiative and admits to never having used cannabis in his life. \u201cThey weren\u2019t organised, they had no political connections, nor media strategy \u2013 it was all a bit ad hoc. Plus, they\u2019re always having arguments among themselves.\u201d He admits that it is hard for those activist groups to get a seat at the table. \u201cThey\u2019re never going to have the size of these companies. Many are getting involved in the industry instead.\u201d Out of a job after the \u201cbig society\u201d unravelled, Moore helped cannabis enthusiast Paul Birch \u2013 who made more than \u00a3200m from the sale of social network Bebo in 2008 \u2013 to establish a new political party, Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol, which fought the 2015 general election. A year later the pair founded Volteface, an organisation to advocate drug reform. Fast-forward two years, and their canny, patient-led campaigning led to the legalisation of medical cannabis in June 2018. However, De Hoedt claims Moore is not interested in patients, nor the small-scale growers who may still be raided, and points to Volteface\u2019s sponsorship by MPX, a multinational cannabis producer. Moore says it would be perfectly reasonable for people to grow small amounts for personal use within a regulated market, and is frank about both Volteface, where he remains an adviser, and the CMC\u2019s business links. \u201cWhen I first got here three years ago, you\u2019d have investor dinners with 15 people in Pall Mall: now there are more than 1,000,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are many companies poised, no doubt.\u201d Ultimately, he argues, public-private partnerships are the best avenue for effective reform. \u201cThe bottom line is, if you live in a liberal democracy you\u2019ve got to accept people will set up legal businesses,\u201d he says. \u201cThey operate in a regulated environment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
