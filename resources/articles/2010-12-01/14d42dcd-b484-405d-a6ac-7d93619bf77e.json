The 24-year-old scored his first two senior goals against Sir Alex Ferguson's team, both coming in the first half from an unfamiliar central midfield role. Spector said: \"It was a great team performance, a good result for us and obviously [I'm] delighted to get the two goals but most importantly we got the win and advance.\" West Ham's last appearance in the semi-finals of the League Cup was in 1989 when Oldham Athletic defeated them 6-3 on aggregate. \"Any four teams in the semi-final can win it and why can't it be us?\" Spector said, insisting that the east London club can also move off the bottom of the Premier League. \"Absolutely. There's still a lot of points to play for and we'll be doing everything we can to get every last one of them,\" he said. West Ham's 3-1 victory at Wigan Athletic on Saturday was their second league win of the campaign. \"I think we've got the right mentality \u2013 not that we didn't before, but finally it has come right for us,\" Spector said. \"We've had some bad luck here and there with certain results and calls against us but we've kept the right mentality and attitude and eventually it's going to turn for us. We've been training hard and working hard to improve and I think that's showed, with the results.\" West Ham's reversal in form has coincided with Wally Downes's appointment as the club's defensive coach last week. \"He's made a big difference, I've actually been playing in midfield since he's been here so I haven't been a beneficiary of everything he's been doing but all the players who have been playing in defence seem to like him and are responding to him,\" said Spector, whose career so far has been as a defender. Grant now has a selection headache for the weekend's Premier League match at Sunderland, with Spector under consideration for what would be only a fourth start of the season. The American's previous start came in the 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford in August where Grant was unhappy at his struggle to carry out the manager's instructions. But Spector is relishing playing in the new position. \"Yeah absolutely I enjoy playing there. I started there once against Arsenal at the Emirates and there was an injury and I was forced to move back to the defence so it has only been a few occasions at most [in the role].\" Meanwhile, Ryan Giggs, who captained United at Upton Park believes the defeat will help the development of the club's younger players. Chris Smalling, F\u00e1bio da Silva, Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, Gabriel Obertan and B\u00e9b\u00e9 all started and were criticised by Ferguson for their ineffectual display. \"Disappointment can help you,\" said Giggs. \"It doesn't feel good at the moment but hopefully the young players who have experienced this can learn from it. Next time they're playing they'll be determined to improve their performance and get a better result. We're Manchester United and we have to rise above [disappointment]. You have to carry on, keep playing your football and not let your head drop.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
