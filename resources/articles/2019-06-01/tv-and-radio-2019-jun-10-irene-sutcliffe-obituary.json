She arrived on television\u2019s most famous cobbles in 1968 as Maggie Clegg, taking over the corner shop and harbouring two skeletons in her closet. Sutcliffe herself was in awe of performing alongside such famous cast members as Pat Phoenix, Violet Carson and Doris Speed. She recalled: \u201cI remember my heart thumping, waiting for my first entrance outside the shop, and Pat saying: \u2018Oh, you\u2019ll be all right, chuck.\u2019\u201d Just two months into her six-year spell in the soap, it was revealed that Maggie\u2019s husband, Les (played by John Sharp), was an alcoholic. He became increasingly violent, was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and the couple divorced. New love came into Maggie\u2019s life with the arrival of Ron Cooke, a draughtsman and recovering alcoholic. When Sutcliffe asked to leave the soap in 1974, the pair were married off and moved to Zaire, leaving behind Maggie\u2019s other dark secret. The Hopkins family took over the shop and discovered the birth certificate of her \u201cson\u201d Gordon, played by the future theatre impresario Bill Kenwright, revealing that he was actually the illegitimate child born to Maggie\u2019s sister Betty Turpin (Betty Driver) following a wartime romance with a sailor; Maggie and Les had adopted Gordon and brought him up as their own. Sutcliffe made a one-off return to the Street in January 1975, when Maggie told Gordon the truth. Irene was born in Burnley, Lancashire, to Polly (nee Ward) and Fred Sutcliffe, who owned an ironmonger\u2019s shop. As a child, she won medals for elocution and acting, attended dance school and performed in productions while studying at Burnley high school. She continued to take acting classes locally before training at Lamda (1945-46), in London. Sutcliffe\u2019s first professional job was in repertory theatre with Harry Hanson\u2019s Court Players in Hastings (1946). She then honed her classical skills during a 1947 season with the company at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon. Her roles included Juliet in Measure for Measure, Ceres in The Tempest and Thaisa in Pericles. After more rep, she returned to the classics to be directed by Robert Helpmann in Murder in the Cathedral, at the Old Vic in London (1952-53), playing one of the Women of Canterbury alongside Robert Donat as Becket. She was back at the Old Vic for two more seasons (1960-62), which included a tour of Russia and Poland. Then, she joined Laurence Olivier\u2019s company at the fledgling Chichester Festival theatre to play the hostess in The Workhouse Donkey (1963) and spent a year playing Mollie Ralston in The Mousetrap (St Martin\u2019s theatre, 1964-65). She had made her West End debut as the society girl Patricia in The Millionairess (New theatre, 1952), which starred Katharine Hepburn. She also played Mrs Norman in Children of a Lesser God (Mermaid and Albery theatres, 1981-82), Madame de Rosemonde in the RSC\u2019s Les Liaisons Dangereuses (Ambassadors theatre, 1989-90), Honoria Waynflete in Murder is Easy (Duke of York\u2019s theatre, 1993) and the retired English literature lecturer EM Ashford in Wit (Vaudeville theatre, 2000). Sutcliffe\u2019s first television role was as Desdemona in the Clemence Dane play Will Shakespeare (1953), directed by Rudolph Cartier and starring Peter Wyngarde as the Bard. She had runs in two children\u2019s serials, as Mary Stahl in Formula for Danger and the computer operator Jean Cary in Pathfinders in Space (both 1960), but most of her small-screen appearances were one-offs until she joined Coronation Street. She remained a solid character actor dipping into TV series and played the receptionist-secretary Gloria throughout the theatrical agent sitcom The 10%ers (1994-96). Her final screen appearance was as the fictional British king\u2019s mother in a 2015 episode of The Royals. One of Sutcliffe\u2019s rare film roles was in the cult classic Withnail &amp; I (1987), as the tearoom waitress refusing to serve Richard E Grant and Paul McGann\u2019s drunken out-of-work actors. On radio, she acted in dozens of plays and appeared on and off as Effie Cadwallander in the soap opera The Dales between 1962 and 1964. Her voice was much in demand for radio readings and audio recordings. From 1985 until her death, she worked hard as a committee member of the Actors\u2019 Benevolent Fund, helping those in the profession who had fallen on hard times. The charity appointed her as a vice-president in 2000. In 1950, Sutcliffe married the stage actor George Cooper (not to be confused with the television actor George A Cooper), a fellow member of the company at the Shakespeare Memorial theatre three years earlier. The marriage ended in divorce. \u2022 Ethel Irene Sutcliffe, actor, born 12 July 1924; died 3 May 2019 \u2022 This article was amended on 25 June 2019. The company at the Shakespeare Memorial theatre in 1947 was not the Royal Shakespeare Company, which did not come into being until 1961."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
