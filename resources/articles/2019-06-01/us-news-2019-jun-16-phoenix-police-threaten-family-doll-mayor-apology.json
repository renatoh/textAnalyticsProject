The incident, caught on camera by bystanders, has prompted an internal police investigation and spurred the family to make a $10m civil claim against the city. Phoenix\u2019s mayor, Kate Gallego, apologized to the family on Saturday, saying in a statement that she was \u201csick over what I have seen in the video\u201d. \u201cIt was completely inappropriate and clearly unprofessional. There is no situation in which this behavior is ever close to acceptable.\u201d Dravon Ames and Iesha Harper, who are engaged, reportedly said they didn\u2019t know that their daughter had the doll when they left the Family Dollar store late last month. Harper, 24, was pregnant, and another daughter was in the car with them. They drove into an apartment complex shortly after leaving the store, headed to their babysitter, according to CNN. A police officer approached the front driver\u2019s side door, holding a gun, opened the door and said \u201cI\u2019m going to put a cap in your ass,\u201d the family alleges in their notice of claim. The officer also allegedly said \u201cI\u2019m gonna shoot you in your fucking face.\u201d A copy of this notice of claim, posted online by an Arizona Republic producer, maintains that the police had not enabled any lights or sirens. \u201cOur hands are up, we\u2019re just trying not to get shot, trying to stay calm,\u201d Ames told CNN. \u201cHe had a gun drawn.\u201d Jeri Williams, the city\u2019s police chief, said in a video posted to Facebook that an internal investigation had been launched. \u201cI, like you, am disturbed by the language and the actions of our officer,\u201d Williams said. A \u201cfact sheet\u201d on the incident posted to Facebook says that the officers had been placed on desk duty. The notice of the family\u2019s claim also alleges that police hurt their one-year-old daughter by pulling on the girl\u2019s arm after Harper wouldn\u2019t hand her over. Ames also claims that he was thrown against their car. After Harper gave her baby to an onlooker, both she and her fiance were handcuffed and put in a police car. The family alleges that an officer told Harper, \u201cI could have shot you in front of your fucking kids.\u201d Ames received a traffic ticket for allegedly driving on a suspended license, impounding his car, NPR notes. While the family\u2019s notice of claim puts the incident \u201con or about May 29\u201d officials have said it was 27 May."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
