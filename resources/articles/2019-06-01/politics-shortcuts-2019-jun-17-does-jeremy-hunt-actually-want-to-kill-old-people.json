Age: A couple of weeks. Appearance: Increasingly desperate. I know the feeling. Yes, but you\u2019re not trying to become prime minister. There are still a few of us left. This is Jeremy Hunt\u2019s campaign for the Tory leadership, I take it? That\u2019s right. Isn\u2019t it all a waste of time? I thought Boris Johnson had it sewn up? Not quite. There\u2019s still a race to be the #NeverBoris candidate in the vote among party members. Last week, Hunt was winning that race. Now, not so much. What happened? There was a TV debate on Sunday, in which Hunt was not inspiring. He\u2019s now dropped behind Rory Stewart in the betting odds. Oh dear. He needs to do something drastic. Mission accomplished, I\u2019d say. After the debate, he tweeted an image of himself with the words: \u201cEvery older person should die with dignity and respect. We should be the party, who sorts it out.\u201d Crikey. At what age would someone qualify as an \u201colder person\u201d? I don\u2019t know, but if Hunt wins, every one of them must die. He\u2019ll make sure the Conservatives deliver. It\u2019s a bold vision. And I suppose it would substantially reduce the country\u2019s spending on healthcare and pensions and remove a lot of Brexit party voters from the electorate. Still, I did expect a slower descent into our murderous dystopia. He didn\u2019t mean it, knucklehead! This isn\u2019t a plan to exterminate the elderly. It\u2019s a badly written promise to make sure that, when they do die, it\u2019s dignified. I see. More like a phased-in, compassionate senicide. He doesn\u2019t actually want to kill anyone, OK? Are you sure? It might help us make sense of his behaviour as health secretary. Honestly, he doesn\u2019t. Just a few days ago, he tweeted another meme saying: \u201cIf we are going to unite the country, we have to show we are serious about uniting the generations.\u201d Wiping out your enemies is what \u201cuniting\u201d usually means. Be that as it may, gaffes such as this are not going to help the #HastobeHunt campaign, which is aiming to sound competent and grown-up. It can\u2019t help that people keep calling him \u2026 you know, the word that rhymes with his name. That was James Naughtie, years ago, by accident. Then Andrew Marr by accident, then Justin Webb by accident and, last week, Victoria Derbyshire, by accident. Exactly. Lots of accidents. \u201cI\u2019m used to it,\u201d Hunt said last week. \u201cI had this when I was at school. Personally, I think people should just grow up and get over the fact that my last name rhymes with a rather unpleasant word.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s why Matt Hancock dropped out? Maybe! Do say: \u201cThat tweet is barbaric.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cJust think what it would do to house prices!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
