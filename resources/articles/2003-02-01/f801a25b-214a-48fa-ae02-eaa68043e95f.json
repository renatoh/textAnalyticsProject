Through the 1990s Europe was clearly heading for a moment when the tendencies that have shaped it in the past half-century arrive at some sort of term. The young US historian William Hitchcock is the latest writer to respond to the opportunity presented by this denouement, although of course he warns, as they all do, that the curtain never comes down on the human drama. The virtues of his book are its brisk clarity, its compression, and the author's decisiveness in determining what to leave out. The big, interesting, but blundering guesses about what was ending and what was beginning in global history that were made by people such as Francis Fukuyama and Samuel Huntingdon a decade or so ago were accompanied and followed by books offering a more judicious rendering of recent history in various parts of the world, and especially Europe. The third of Walter Laqueur's books on postwar Europe came out in 1992. John Roberts and Norman Davies produced fine general histories of Europe, Davies giving eastern Europe particular attention throughout. More recently Mark Mazower and Richard Vinen have written outstanding books on Europe in the 20th century. The American but British-based Larry Siedentop has offered a provocative essay on Europe's democratic deficit, and David Calleo of Johns Hopkins University a strong analytical work examining Europe's future in the light of what its 20th-century past reveals. The end of the Soviet empire permitted a unification of Europe both geographically and in terms of the values and political organisation of its states that is without precedent. The weak group of democratic countries that emerged from the second world war had, with US help, prevailed over their internal enemies on the left and the right, deterred any impulse the Soviet Union might have had to expand territorially, and went on to absorb authoritarian regimes in southern Europe. While growing in economic strength and creating more substantial supranational institutions, they were finally able to welcome the eastern European nations back into the family. True, the Balkan wars struck a jarring note in this symphony of success, and the dilatoriness of the European Union in admitting eastern members prolonged the last movement. And a belief that the new Europe is preoccupied with indulgent consumption and protection from the ills that beset human beings in other regions - that it is nothing more than a \"multinational supermarket and insurance company\" as one critic put it - disturbs many Europeans. Yet the sense that there has been a resolution of the European story and a pride in the manner of the resolution is real. This is the ground that Hitchcock covers, and in a book presumably intended, in part, as a course work for history students, he does it well. He is good, for instance, on the contradictory origins of the two main Western international organisations, with Nato owing more, initially, to European urging, and the European community more to US example. He is interesting on the Marshall Plan, suggesting that it was not vital to European economic recovery except in a psychological sense, a conclusion worth evaluating today when similar plans are demanded at all points of the compass. His account of the way the Franco-German friendship treaty of 1963 capped a period when the leaders of France and Germany had failed to agree on anything, except that it was vital they should appear united, is sharply done. His sorting out of the factors behind the Soviet collapse suggests that the seizure of eastern Europe after 1945 may have been Moscow's fundamental mistake. In the end the Soviet Union lacked the means either to coerce or bribe the region, and once it went, the USSR was bound to follow. The book does not reflect at all on the impact of September 11 on Europe, which seems an omission. On the other hand Hitchcock attaches too much prominence to Europe's failure in the Balkans, which gets a whole chapter. There is also arguably too much attention paid to recent anti-semitic, racist and rightwing developments, and too simplistic a view of the EU's problems in engaging the loyalty of Europeans. There is in US accounts of Europe sometimes an echo of My Fair Lady's \"Why can't a woman be more like a man?\", with the new world urging American virtues on the old continent even though for all our connections the two are very different places. Hitchcock's book does not have the quirky vividness and sense of alternate possibilities that Vinen offers, or the sweep of political and cultural reference Mazower displays. Occasionally, as in its account of European institutions, it reads more like a primer than a history book. But Hitchcock is very sure-footed and in command of his material. His book should go on the shelf devoted to that combination of extraordinary good luck and less remarkable but still substantial good management that have marked the recent history of Europe."}, "isHosted": false}}}
