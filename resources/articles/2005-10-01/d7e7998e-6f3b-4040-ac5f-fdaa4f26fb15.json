It's strange to think that when Greenspan arrived at the Fed in 1987, Japan and West Germany (the Berlin Wall was still standing then) were being talked about as the new global powerhouses. Greenspan, according his fans, gave the US cheap money and price stability and its corporations responded with a productivity revolution, showing the rest of the world what it really means to be an economic superpower. But that job was really done in Greenspan's first decade. The policies of the past eight years may mean the verdict of history is very different - the bubble banker who left a disastrous inheritance. Greenspan's most famous phrase, \"irrational exuberance\", was a description of the mood of the stock markets in December 1996, well in advance of the dotcom bust. But in practice he did next to nothing to deflate the bubble. In 1997 he organised the Wall Street bail-out of the failing hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management and pumped liquidity into the financial system after currency crises in Russia and Asia. Wall Street concluded that Uncle Alan, instead of letting markets correct naturally, would always be there with a lifeboat or a rate cut. A message of markets-without-risk kept the bubble inflating and, by the end, Greenspan himself seemed to have swallowed the new economy rubbish, talking of \"a pivotal period of economic history\" and the \"remarkable wave of new technologies.\" Most famously, he even cited \"security analysts' projections of long-term earnings\" as an explanation of his sang-froid. A year later the credibility of Wall Street analysts was on a par with Enron's accounts. The crash obliged Greenspan to revert to his usual medicine - lower interest rates - and US consumers have gorged themselves on cheap money ever since. The results are a US savings rate that is one of the lowest in the world (a crazy statistic for the most advanced economy); a housing boom showing dangerous signs of cracks, and a current account deficit running at $2bn a day. Only one Fed chairman has ever lasted longer than Greenspan, and that was William McChesney Martin from 1951-1970. His most remembered phrase was that it was the job of central bankers to take away the punchbowl when the party got going. Greenspan was the banker who left the punchbowl in place. Maybe he will get away with it. The strength of the dollar this year suggests the rest of the world is not yet a seller of US assets or its debts. But bubbles as big as those of the late 1990s tend to have echoes: the US government and US consumers have run up record debts in avoiding a post-dotcom recession, but borrowings have to be repaid in the end. Just not under Greenspan. R&amp;D as Cinderella Despite the DTI's attempts to put a positive spin on yesterday's Research and Development Scoreboard, the message emerged loud and clear: the UK is lagging behind its competitors. According to the release accompanying this year's annual survey, which analyses data from 750 British companies, the number of middle-sized companies investing heavily in research and development has increased by more than 75% over the past four years with those spending more than \u00a3300,000 up by 100 on last year. But such optimistic figures are very far from the whole story. Whatever our recent improvements, the UK still spends a paltry 1.9% of GDP on R&amp;D, compared with the 2.2% spent by France, 2.5% by Germany, 2.6% by the USA and 3.2% by Japan. Even worse, a third of R&amp;D is foreign-owned and of no particular benefit to the UK, which is bad news for a government whose stated tactic for beating off competition from emerging economies is to boost significantly the \"value-added\", knowledge-led economy. Neither do future commitments look good. At its Lisbon summit in 2002, the EU set a target to increase R&amp;D spending to 3% of GDP by 2010. Britain could only agree to a limited 2.5% by 2014. John Chapman, who introduced the scoreboard back in 1991 while at the DTI, blames Britain's higher interest rates (in recent years) and shareholder pressure for ever-higher and more solid dividend payments. Not much can be done about interest rates but the point about City fund managers' love of cash is fair. Their attitude is simply not shared by big US investors, who take fright when the likes of Microsoft talk about dividends. It requires a long-term perspective but isn't that the nature of industries such as software and biotechnology?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
