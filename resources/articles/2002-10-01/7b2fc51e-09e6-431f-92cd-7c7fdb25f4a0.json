Last night sources close to McCarthy said he had received no contact from Sunderland in any capacity. Moreover, there were some at the club stating that McCarthy would not be moving to Wearside. McCarthy, they said, is as much of a favourite as David O'Leary was until the club's semi-official voice, the Sunderland Echo, rubbished O'Leary's chances on Tuesday afternoon. It apparently came as dismaying information to McCarthy's camp yesterday to hear that he was the subject of a similar declaration. \"Mick McCarthy will not be the next manager of Sunderland,\" said the Echo. Though McCarthy remains interested in the job he is acutely aware that any news of contact with Sunderland would play extremely badly in Ireland. He is already under pressure there after a bad opening result in the European Championship against Russia and from the continued fall-out from the Roy Keane affair at the World Cup. McCarthy also has a qualifier against Switzerland to organise next Wednesday. Sunderland would have to find around \u00a3700,000 to buy McCarthy out of his contract with the Football Association of Ireland. That contract is due to expire in June 2004. Other names that have refused to disappear are Gary Megson and George Burley. Joe Royle has also emerged as a willing contender. \"I would like the job, of course I would,\" Royle said. Part of the reason for the mystery is that behind the scenes at Sunderland there may be some disagreement about the direction the club should pursue. This was partially revealed yes terday when Sunderland's plc chairman Bryan Sanderson said that it was \"pressure from the plc\" that led to Reid's sacking on Monday. The implication was that without that pressure the football club chairman Bob Murray would not have acted and there is the possibility that the two parties have differing views on the future. \"We have been unhappy with performances over the last 18 months,\" Sanderson said. \"And as a plc we have looked at key success factors, such as the stadium and training facilities. One of the factors unquestionably we are unhappy with was the management of the players on the field. I was at Arsenal last Sunday and the first half was awful, really embarrassing; we hardly touched the ball. \"The fans have reason to expect better than that and our objective is to improve all aspects of performance.\" Sanderson added that reports that Reid had departed with a severance payment of some \u00a35m were wildly incorrect; the figure is more like \u00a3500,000. The club also announced that Michael Gray had agreed a new four-year contract and Kevin Phillips tried to reassure fans that he would not be following Reid out of the Stadium of Light. \"I'm under contract and I'm happy to stay and give my all,\" Phillips said. If he is bemused in private, though, it would not be a surprise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
