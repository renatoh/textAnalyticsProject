Yet such is the vibrancy and sweep of modern racing that within seven hours, the debate was open once again. Falbrav is the best horse in Europe this year, of that there can be little doubt. Saturday's race was his eighth of the season - each one of them a Group One - and his fourth victory. It was also his first attempt at a mile, in the strongest eight-furlong race of the season. But whether he is the equal of Mineshaft, who swaggered away with the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park in New York on Saturday night, is another matter. It is not an issue that will ever be settled on the track, since Mineshaft is a dirt horse and Falbrav does his racing on grass. They may catch sight of each other on Breeders' Cup day at Santa Anita next month, but an eyeball-to-eyeball meeting in adjacent stalls looks out of the question. It is a pity, but it is not as if the connections of either horse can be accused of cowardice. Falbrav's busy season has taken him to three countries so far, at trips from eight furlongs to 12 furlongs, on going that has ranged from firm to soft. Mineshaft's race on Saturday was his fourth consecutive Grade One, yielding three wins and a close second. Falbrav is now Coral's 2-1 favourite for the Breeders' Cup Turf, just ahead of Godolphin's Sulamani, who was also an impressive winner at Belmont on Saturday, on 9-4. High Chaparral, last year's winner, can be backed at 5-1, though that will shrink rapidly if he wins the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on Sunday. Mineshaft, meanwhile, is 5-4 for the Classic, although he will surely be odds-on if he lines up at Santa Anita. Whether Mineshaft does make one last appearance in the world's richest race remains to be seen. William Farrish III, his owner, will retire Mineshaft to stud at the end of the season, and his covering fee is expected to be the largest for a first-season sire in American history. In the days before the Breeders' Cup, the Jockey Club Gold Cup was the defining race of the US season, and it retains much of its lustre. \"It's the Jockey Club Gold Cup,\" Neil Howard, his trainer, said afterwards. \"I don't know what else to say.\" Farrish, too, confirmed that Belmont had been Mineshaft's primary target. \"He has had a hard, hard campaign, and we will see [about the Breeders' Cup],\" he said. \"This is a race I have wanted to win all my life. Of course, the Breeders' Cup has come on, but this is a great race and really a test of champions.\" For Falbrav, there is the possibility of a run in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in preference to the Breeders' Cup, but the Turf, over an easy 12 furlongs for a $2m purse, will surely prove impossible to resist. \"Nothing is really set in stone yet,\" Cumani said yesterday. \"We want to see how the next few days pan out and see how he takes re-entering training and how he takes the autumn because the temperature is changing now. \"He has had eight races at Group One level this season and we just want to do what is right for the horse.\" Sulamani's success at Belmont gave Godolphin their eighth Group One of the season, and Mamool took the total to nine in the Preis Von Europa at Cologne yesterday. He beat another British-based runner, Sir Mark Prescott's Albanova, by a comfortable two lengths, and will head for the Melbourne Cup at Flemington next month at the top of his form. The other 50 per cent of Godolphin's weekend team disappointed badly, though. Dubai Destination was last in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot, while Moon Ballad, the Dubai World Cup winner, was soundly beaten by Mineshaft."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
