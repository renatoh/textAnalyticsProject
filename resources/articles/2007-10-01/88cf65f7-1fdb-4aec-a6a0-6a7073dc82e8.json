The performance of Schubert's Trio in B flat - a legacy of the quartet's recent stint as a trio, when leader Corina Belcea-Fisher was on maternity leave - was revealing. The sound of the other three players may be more homogenous, but it is the brilliance of Belcea-Fisher's playing that makes the quartet what it is. There were moments over the weekend when the quartet sounded more like a soloist with three-piece accompaniment than an integrated unit. This was particularly noticeable in Death and the Maiden and the Quartettsatz - a peculiar performance that underplayed the driven urgency of the piece in favour of a somewhat cloying sweetness. Only in the C major Quintet later in the same concert did Natalie Clein's second cello provide a counterbalance to the top-heavy ensemble. Thankfully, the problem seemed to have vanished the following day when the Belceas, very much a single unit, tackled Schubert's last quartet, the G major D887, capturing the work in all its obsessive, almost operatic strangeness and intensity. Schubertiads are usually dominated by lieder performances. Here there was only one, though this was an instance of quality making up for quantity as tenor Mark Padmore and pianist Paul Lewis performed Die Sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin. This was a first attempt at the cycle by the partnership (and unlike the rest of the series was not recorded by BBC Radio 3 for broadcast in early December) but it was already a rewarding performance from two exceptional musicians."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
