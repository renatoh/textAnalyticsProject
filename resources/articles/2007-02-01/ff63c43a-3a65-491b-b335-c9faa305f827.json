He enthuses that Web 2.0, the latest incarnation of the internet that, among other things, has spawned online \"communities\" such as MySpace, stands to transform the way patients and hospitals interact, and he believes his social enterprise website, Patient Opinion, is the channel through which it will happen. \"This is democratisation of voice,\" he says. \"It's incredibly exciting. We're not quite on the leading edge of Web 2, but we are on the leading edge of where it hits the NHS.\" He says the site, which operates as an intermediary, enabling patients to tell hospitals what they think and to make suggestions for improvements, and for the hospitals to respond, \"allows that public structured conversation about micro aspects of service which hasn't happened up to now\". Hodgkin has a tendency to slip into jargon, but strip it away and a fairly convincing argument emerges that he might be on to something. People who have had a recent hospital visit or treatment simply log on to Patient Opinion and register their complaints or compliments. After some editing by Hodgkin and his team, these are published online. They can also be sent directly to the primary care trusts (PCTs) concerned - and sometimes to individual managers in hospitals via a live feed. It is this \"real time\" aspect that makes it particularly effective, according to Hodgkin. Patients frequently make practical suggestions that the hospital can act upon quickly, and because the site enables the hospital to announce online any changes made, the patient gets speedy feedback. Simple changes \"It gives managers that extra bit of bite to go to busy staff and say we've got to do something about this,\" he says. He produces a bundle of promotional literature, including testimonials that illustrate how, in response to suggestions from patients, some hospitals have implemented changes on wards as simple as moving signs so they are easily seen by people in wheelchairs to adapting equipment to better meet the needs of older patients. He does not know how many of the 1,200 postings to date have been acted upon, because not all the hospitals inform him, but admits: \"Now, 80%-90% of the time they are not going to do anything about it, but at least some of the time they would.\" The site has capacity to host up to 100,000 postings a year, and Hodgkin adds: \"If 1% of those get acted upon, that's 1,000 improvements.\" Patient Opinion's other appeal, he argues, is that while NHS organisations subscribe to it, they neither own it nor run it. Hodgkin says his \"eureka moment\" about Patient Opinion came in 2004 while logged on to the buying and selling website eBay. Looking at the way users rated each other in terms of trustworthiness set him to wondering if something could be done for the NHS that tapped into people's willingness to exchange information and ideas on a site they trusted. He signed up for a course at the London School for Social Entrepreneurs, which turned out to be \"a life changing event\". Partly, he says, \"because I was at an age when I needed something different\". But it also galvanised him to act. Hodgkin made an early decision not to run the site as a charity because, he says, the voluntary sector is \"too grant dependent\", and he wanted to avoid applying for grant funding every two or three years. The site has grown steadily since it first rolled out beyond its South Yorkshire pilot 15 months ago, but while being a not-for-profit social enterprise has advantages, Hodgkin acknowledges the limitations. He cannot go to venture capitalists for a quick cash injection, for example, and the site is reliant on subscriptions. \"If we were doing it for profit, we would probably have grown faster, but we wouldn't have had the same values commitment and buy-in from patients and staff,\" he says. \"They really do value that it is there, that it's independent.\" If it goes bust, Hodgkin believes that it will be because of cash flow problems, \"not because it doesn't work\". And there are other possible stumbling blocks. He has to navigate the thorny issue of editing submissions to the site. Legal advice has helped him avoid pitfalls such as defaming people, and he is careful to check the authenticity of particularly critical postings. He says: \"When we first went live, we had no idea [what would happen]. Will it be very bland or will it be very rancorous?\" On average, 50% of comments are positive, he says, and the majority of those that are critical are \"very considered, very thoughtful\". He insists: \"We'd never defame an individual. So if it says, 'Mr Jones the gynaecologist is a butcher,' we wouldn't publish it. And we don't defame whole teams. So if somebody said, 'All the nurses on ward 16 were lazy,' we will edit that to say: 'I thought all the nurses on ward 16 who looked after me were lazy.'\" The site does not aim to be representative of wider patient views, Hodgkin says, only to make a difference on the frontline of services. It does not collect user-profile data, which makes it hard to track who is using it, but Hodgkin says this means people who might otherwise shy away from posting - for example, if they have a medical condition they are embarrassed to talk about - feel free to post. Another issue he has had to address is that while 16 organisations - a mixture of PCTs, NHS trusts, strategic health authorities and patient representative bodies - have embraced it with open arms, others are more sceptical about being so publicly judged. \"A manager of one trust said: 'Why should we pay you to provide a public site where the public can slag off our staff?' Well, the first thing is you're not paying us to do that. If your staff are getting slagged off, they are being praised as well. The question is how do you want to interact with that?\" Hodgkin says he has had to respond to issues as they arise. For example, to make sure people without internet access are not excluded from the service, printed forms are distributed to some GP surgeries for patients to fill in, and there is a freephone number. Looking ahead, Hodgkin believes the Patient Opinion model could, with adjustments, be adapted to other services, such as the criminal justice system. But as far as his NHS model is concerned, he accepts that planning ahead remains difficult. For example, while the Department of Health has been supportive - it provided some set-up funding - he says there is a risk that if the site is successful, ministers might be tempted to establish a centralised, and therefore not independent, version. For now Hodgkin is content to be a GP one day a week, and to focus on the task at hand the rest of the week. He says: \"It's a really exciting place to be because it's always changing and we are always learning new stuff.\" Curriculum Vitae Age 55. Status Married, two children from first marriage.
