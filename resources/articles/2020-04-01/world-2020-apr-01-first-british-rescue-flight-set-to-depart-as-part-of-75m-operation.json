As the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, continue negotiations to get a series of charter flights to help the most vulnerable stranded UK nationals, British embassies around the world disclosed details of operations under way. There are thought to be about 400,000 Britons stranded overseas. The flight from Algeria will offer seats costing \u00a3186, according to the Foreign Office. Flights out of the country were suspended on 19 March leaving few options for British travellers or charity workers who wanted to leave. In South Africa, the British high commissioner, Nigel Casey, went on national TV to say his team was working \u201cflat out\u201d to organise charter flights, with permission in principle to fly already granted by the country\u2019s government. So far 2,500 people have registered to leave but Casey said the number seeking repatriation was more likely to be between 5,000 and 7,500. He also revealed that 179 elderly Britons on the luxury liner Queen Mary 2 were on their way back to the UK after the ship\u2019s captain got permission to refuel in Durban. Nicola Pollitt, the British ambassador in Nepal, confirmed there would be charter flights out of the country and that ticket prices would be capped. She also revealed on social media that British Gurkhas had been helping to extract tourists from remote locations, including six trekkers in the Himalayan Langtang region and seven in the mountainous district of Manang. Charter flights have already left from Tunisia and Ghana. Arrangements have been put in place for flights back from Kenya and Zimbabwe. Ethiopian Airlines has been persuaded to restart flights from Harare after a conversation between Raab and Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed. In India, the acting high commissioner is under severe pressure from worried Britons to reveal details of flights. Jan Thompson said there were \u201cmany thousand of British nationals\u201d stranded and that the dates and location of flights would be announced as soon as they were confirmed. The British ambassador in Thailand warned thousands stranded not to expect charter flights as commercial airlines were still allowed to fly. This was of no comfort to people facing multiple cancellations, exorbitant pricing and and no instant refunds. One mother who contacted the Guardian said she was at her wits\u2019 end over efforts to get her young son home. \u201cWe bought a ticket on Etihad Airways which was cancelled and cost \u00a31,000. We bought another ticket for over \u00a31,200 with Qatar Airways on Friday after getting nowhere with our MP or the Foreign Office,\u201d she said. Up to 10,000 British nationals stranded in New Zealand, which is just days into a four-week lockdown, have been warned by the high commissioner, Laura Clarke, that they may not be on the target list. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been decided yet if the programme will include New Zealand and I don\u2019t want to over-promise. There are Britons stuck all over the world, some of them in much more dangerous situations, in countries where the health systems aren\u2019t functioning at all,\u201d she said. She confirmed that 10,000 had registered their desire to leave the country, and added: \u201cIf there are chartered flights, it won\u2019t happen straight away and it won\u2019t be a silver bullet.\u201d One elderly UK national is among four people to have died on the coronavirus-stricken cruise ship the Zaandam, where nine people have tested positive for Covid-19 and dozens are ill with flu-like symptoms. British passengers thanked Donald Trump after he said he would intervene to prevent the Zaandam and its sister vessel, the Rotterdam , which are trying to dock in Florida, from becoming \u201cghost ships\u201d. Trump said on Tuesday he would discuss the matter with the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, who previously said he would not allow the vessels of mostly \u201cforeigners\u201d to be dumped in his state. The ships do not yet have final approval to dock at Fort Lauderdale but the US president said he was \u201cgoing to do what is right not only for us but for humanity\u201d. Hundreds of passengers, including 229 British nationals, have been confined to their cabins for more than a week after several Latin American countries refused to allow the Zaandam into port or evacuate critically ill passengers, leaving the cruise liner stranded at sea. The Rotterdam was then sent on a rescue operation to meet its sister ship off the coast of Panama, where symptomless passengers were transferred on to it. \u201cThanks to President Trump for overturning the Florida governor\u2019s decision and allowing us to dock and make arrangements to get back to the UK,\u201d Raksha, a British passenger on the Rotterdam, told the Guardian. Guy Jones, whose parents, Nick and Celia, are also on the Rotterdam, said: \u201cI am encouraged by President Trump\u2019s comments during his press briefing last night about assisting the Zaandam and the Rotterdam. \u201cThere are people onboard both ships that need medical care and on the Zaandam in particular. This needs to happen as soon as humanly possible.\u201d On Wednesday both ships briefly stopped off the coast of Cuba to transfer a nurse and oxygen from the Rotterdam to the Zaandam. Representatives have previously warned that two critical patients on the Zaandam might die before they reach Florida."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
