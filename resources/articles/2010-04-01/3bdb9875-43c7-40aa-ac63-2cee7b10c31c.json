It has been suggested that Yakubu will be sold this summer to improve Moyes' transfer budget having struggled to reclaim form and a first-team place since rupturing an achilles tendon at Tottenham Hotspur in November 2008. However, in an assessment that will resonate alarmingly with David Beckham, currently sidelined with a similar problem, the Everton manager believes the recovery period is typical of achilles injuries and says Yakubu remains part of his plans at Goodison Park. \"Yes, he has a future here, he has a contract,\" said Moyes, who deployed his \u00a311.25m signing as a substitute against West Ham United on Sunday and was repaid with what almost proved a match-winning goal. \"He has had a difficult year with his achilles. It has been tough for him. To have a ruptured achilles tendon like David Beckham has is a really bad injury, it really is, and to get back is hard. \"Yak has worked hard to get back into condition and we want to give him every opportunity to get back to where he was. I think he is physically there, but it might be a long-term healing process that he has to go through before we can say he is really over the injury. I still see him some mornings when he looks as if he thinks it is a problem but once he gets going he is fine.\" Yakubu's 85th\u2011minute header, cancelled out by Ilan's diving header for West Ham moments later, was the forward's fifth goal this season but his third in his last six appearances for Everton. Moyes' stance on the 27-year-old could alter should Everton receive an official bid for the player this summer but the manager added: \"I hope he has the appetite to get back to what he was. He trains well but what Yak thrives on is goals. When he gets his goals it brings him alive and his record in the Premier League is very good. It has just tailed off in the last 18 months because of the injury.\" Diniyar Bilyaletdinov, Everton's other goalscorer against West Ham, has said he has no regrets over his \u00a39m transfer from Lokomotiv Moscow last August despite an inconsistent debut season in England. The Russia international has not had a break from football for almost 18 months due to the timing of his move from Moscow and has shown only fleeting glimpses of his undoubted talent at Everton. However, after his sixth goal of the season on Sunday, Bilyaletdinov said: \"For me it has been one of the best seasons of my life. I have scored more goals than before. I have had a long season now, one-and-a-half, and for me it is very impressive. I have enjoyed every minute on the pitch with this club.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
