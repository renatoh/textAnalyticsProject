I hope it becomes a reality and I score in the final, then win the African Cup of Nations [being played in Egypt next month] too.\u201d Salah believes the experience of last season\u2019s final could prove decisive for Liverpool against a Spurs\u2019 team making their club\u2019s first appearance in Europe\u2019s showpiece occasion. He told BeIN Sports: \u201cThis is our second final in a row. We lost the first but everything feels better this time around and we have more experience than last time. We are all looking forward and we had a good preparation period in Spain. We are back in Liverpool and we are feeling very motivated as players and coaching staff. I hope we can win it this time. \u201cWe had great preparations in Spain and it was a good time to prepare there. The team is now at the best level physically. So I hope this stop was an advantage for us in the final.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
