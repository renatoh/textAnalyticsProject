Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Andy Beshear, had just accused the Republican governor, Matt Bevin, of lying in a debate last week, saying: \u201cThis is just more of the same from a governor who says that someone commits suicide on a casino floor every night.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never said anything like that in my life,\u201d Bevin shot back at his Democratic challenger for the governor\u2019s seat. \u201cIt\u2019s all on tape!\u201d responded a flabbergasted Beshear as Bevin continued his denials. Of course, there is a tape: the governor\u2019s comments that people kill themselves in casinos \u2013 though, not specifically casino floors \u2013 were made without proof in July and helped fuel Kentucky\u2019s election news cycle for a few days. But Bevin appears to have taken a lesson from the president on the art of denial. With a disapproval rating of 53%, Bevin is currently ranked the second-least popular governor in the country according to Morning Consult \u2013 and for much of the year, he was the least popular. But despite that unpopularity \u2013 largely driven by his combative personality and repeated attacks on public school teachers \u2013 there\u2019s a fairly good chance he\u2019s about to win re-election on 5 November. \u201cI think the odds are in his favour because the political landscape tilts in his direction,\u201d said Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky. \u201cThis is a socially conservative state and he\u2019s a social conservative. It\u2019s a pro-Trump state and he\u2019s wrapped himself around Trump. And he has presided over a good economy for most of the state.\u201d A Mason-Dixon poll earlier this month showed Bevin in a dead heat with Beshear, Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, with each candidate polling at 46%. In Kentucky, conservative voters are faced with a choice that Republicans around the country will have to make in 12 months: will they vote for an incumbent despite what is seen as an off-putting personality? Do party power and policy outweigh everything else? Like Trump, Bevin\u2019s words have gotten him into trouble. When public school teachers protested against controversial pension reform efforts, Bevin said the strike would result in children left at home without supervision being sexually assaulted and ingesting poison. Later, he blamed the accidental shooting of a seven-year-old girl by her 11-year-old brother on teachers who were protesting that day, leaving schools closed. He said those protesting against pension reform had a \u201cthug mentality\u201d. Primaried by Republican challengers earlier this year, he secured his party\u2019s nomination with just 52% of the vote, losing large swaths of the state. In a state where Trump carried more than 60% of the vote in 2016 and every county except for the homes of the two biggest cities, Bevin has anchored himself to the president, portraying the gubernatorial election as part of a larger national battle. He has started calling his opponent \u201cLil\u2019 Andy\u201d \u2013 seemingly inspired by Trump\u2019s taunts against \u201cLil\u2019\u201d Marco Rubio during the presidential primaries \u2013 and the \u201cHunter Biden of Kentucky\u201d. Bevin\u2019s television ads prominently feature images of the governor with the president. One Bevin ad that has been popping up on Facebook tells voters to back Bevin to show support for Trump, saying: \u201cRadical liberals in Washington are only focused on one thing: impeaching President Trump. Vote for Matt Bevin on Nov. 5 to send them a message!\u201d Republican strategist Scott Jennings says the push to impeach Trump is pushing Americans into partisan corners \u2013 and that could work to Bevin\u2019s advantage. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if impeachment is good for the country, but it might be good for Matt Bevin in this particular campaign,\u201d he said. Trump has endorsed Bevin and is scheduled to hold a rally for the governor in Kentucky on the eve of the election. While Bevin has tried to nationalise the race, Beshear has tried to keep the focus local while being careful not to alienate Republicans who could land on his side. Beshear, 41, is not exactly the kind of candidate that would inspire enthusiasm among the Democratic party\u2019s increasingly progressive base elsewhere in the country. He is the son of Kentucky\u2019s last governor before Bevin, Steve Beshear. He tends to avoid criticising Trump, refusing to call the president\u2019s tweet telling four minority congresswomen to \u201cgo back\u201d to their ancestral homelands racist and has remained silent on impeachment. One of his TV ads even features Trump supporters. If he does win, it could well be due to Bevin\u2019s antagonism towards the state\u2019s educators and Beshear\u2019s embrace of them. Beshear has made teachers a focal point of his campaign. He constantly rails against Bevin\u2019s \u201cbullying\u2019 of educators and promised that he would never bully fellow Kentuckians if elected. For a running mate, he tapped Jacqueline Coleman, a public high school assistant principal who was formerly a social studies teacher and basketball coach. Volunteers from 120 Strong, a grassroots advocacy group initially formed by education employees to oppose pension reform and claims 40,000 members, have been campaigning for Beshear across the state. \u201cThis is not about Team Democrat or Team Republican,\u201d said Nema Brewer, a public school district employee who is a co-founder and leader of the group. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it has to be. We all have to shed our political affiliations and do the right thing here and get a foot off our throat.\u201d Though many Republicans may be put off by Bevin\u2019s demeanour and treatment of educators, there will be Christian conservatives among them who cast ballots for the governor \u2013 as many did for Trump \u2013 simply because of his stance on abortion. Bevin publicly embraces faith. He has touted himself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s most pro-life governor\u201d while attacking Beshear, who supports Roe v Wade, as taking \u201cblood money\u201d from abortion providers to fund his campaign and choosing the side of \u201cdeath over life\u201d. With 57% of Kentucky adults saying that abortion should be illegal in all or most cases according to a 2014 Pew Research Center poll, Bevin\u2019s hard push on abortion and faith could pay off. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons that a Republican who was lukewarm on Bevin or didn\u2019t vote for him in the primary might go home in November: it\u2019s because at the end of the day, they don\u2019t want to vote for a pro-abortion liberal Democrat,\u201d said Jennings, the Republican strategist. \u201cYou can look past your quibbles with someone on their communications style if you know they\u2019re going to protect life. It\u2019s a huge issue for Kentucky voters.\u201d One such voter is Vince Stover, the pastor of the Bible Pathway Baptist church in Lexington. He says he is deeply disappointed with Bevin, particularly with his attacks on teachers and political opponents. But Stover plans to reluctantly vote for Bevin next week due to the governor\u2019s anti-abortion stance. \u201cIt\u2019s an important enough issue for me that that\u2019s what it comes down to,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are other things I find important, but not to the same level as that. I can overlook disagreements on other things more than I can overlook abortion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
