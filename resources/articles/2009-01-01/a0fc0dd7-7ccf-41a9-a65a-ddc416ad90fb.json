How? I mean, how? Find out which of the ladies will be leaving the house tonight live with me from 9pm. 8.56pm: I am having so many technical problems tonight I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT EITHER. Apologies if I disappear. 9pm: It's starting! Warning - copious amounts of alcohol will be needed to emerge from this evening unscathed. Davina is wearing a belted military-style jacket that I covet slightly. She's all cheekbones at the moment, isn't she? She keeps wandering out of shot, which may be in shot if you have a wide-screen telly, but I don't. 9.01pm: Davina is taking the celebrities to task about their incessant whining - \"Nobody forced you to do it! AND you're getting paid!\" Admirable sentiments, I'm sure, but they can't hear you. Then she reads out the eviction line numbers, and each lady is booed vociferously. Seriously, what has Mutya done to offend anyone? 9.04pm: The highlights of the previous 24 hours begin. Tina seems to be arguing for some kind of student-like food division, in which she keeps her own rations separate - \"We'll put our six pounds together to make \u00a312, then we'll have our own food.\" Ulrika goes mumsy and tells them not to. Coolio objects also, and then digresses into some kind of exposition about how women should be at home and pregnant. The lads snigger together and Terry says he thinks the ladies feel like they're in a rehab; he and Verne agree they should be grateful to be getting paid to lose weight. When it comes to putting the shopping list together, Tina puts forward her individualism idea again; Tommy subdues his outrage at this lack of solidarity. 9.07pm: Coolio doesn't want to be in the house if people are going to be childish. Pot, kettle - this is Coolio. Y'know, he did Gangster's Paradise. Michelle doesn't want eggs. A cut back to Davina imitating Tommy's facial expressions and it's time for a break. 9.18pm: \"I'm not arsed. At all,\" says Tina. She seems to be referring to being friends with the boys, and then deems Verne \"a sneaky little twat\". Ulrika muses that Verne swears because he wants to impress the boys. Right. Meanwhile, the others are in the living room trying to put the shopping list together. Tina wanders out and makes Michelle read her personal requests aloud, in the manner of a nursery teacher encouraging a recalcitrant child. Coolio begs Tommy to go and read the shopping list in the diary room instead, because he doesn't trust women. \"Oh, God, you're an anus,\" declares Ulrika. Tina begins talking to herself. Seriously, woman, if you're that outspoken and opinionated and offended, then stand up to Coolio. The man himself wanders into the garden, where Terry tells him that Ulrika would be fine reading out their shopping list. \"I don't want her to!\" whines Coolio. That's the one who was criticising other people for being childish earlier, yes? Coolio then goes back in and says he wants to read it. Michelle says she'll read it. Coolio says no. Michelle suggests LaToya. He agrees. LaToya doesn't want to read it. Then Tina and Coolio start shouting at each other before he's called to the diary room to calm down. \"They're being silly, man!\" he shouts. \"They're acting like children.\" Outside, Terry wishes for a Supernanny-style naughty step. And then Coolio makes the brilliant claim of being a chef - \"I have a cookbook coming out! They shouldn't even have a say when it comes to the food!\" 9.20pm: \"You wouldn't talk to me like that if you were fucking me and paying me mortgage!\" shouts Tina. Mutya's face is a sight to behold. 9.24pm: Tina's called to the diary room as Coolio skulks off, muttering, \"You can get whoever y'all want to read it.\" Terry chortles, \"We've got a bit of extra time now with the shopping list!\" Don't MENTION THE SHOPPING LIST, man. 9.26pm: Tina doesn't like people talking in a loud, rude, aggressive, arrogant manner. Really, Tina? Nor do I. Terry is in the ashtray with Coolio, trying to calm him down in the way you would a three-year-old throwing a tantrum - \"Ssh. Ssh. It doesn't matter.\" I was so impressed with Terry and Tommy taking Coolio to task in the first few days, but now it seems like they can't be bothered. Or, alternatively, have been told not to. 9.29pm: Davina makes a joke. Nobody laughs. 9.32pm: The housemates have a new task - to not moan for one hour. If they manage it, they'll be festooned with food, booze and messages from home. Every time someone complains, one of the messages from home will be removed, and that'll be done in alphabetical order. Worryingly, the housemates don't think they can manage to not complain for an hour, so they agree to stay silent. Mutya and Ulrika gag themselves. Tina calls herself \"a whinging bitch\". Obviously, Coolio doesn't want to be silent. He and Ben discuss the possibility of smoking a cigarette. Ben's accent becomes even posher. 9.37pm: The housemates have passed their task. Ulrika suggests an hour of silence every day. \"They must have thought we were right moaners,\" says Mutya. True fact, Buena. They get their party, which looks similar to Kerry Katona and Coleen Nolan's party from the Iceland ads in which they force-feed Jason Donovan pavlova. 9.40pm: Time for the messages from home - all in a sugar-glass bottle, which need to be smashed over the housemate's head by the person they want to read their letter out. LaToya is bewildered when Tina brains her. She gets a message from Tito and her mum. Ulrika reads Michelle's message from her boyfriend, who tells her not to worry about \"the Ben issue\". Then somebody - probably Tina - says, \"I think you and Ben can have sex now!\" Hilarity ensues, and Coolio seems to take it as some kind of proof that his teasing of her did no harm. Verne seems to be very drunk and is thus making crude comments as well as character assessments of everyone there. Coolio threatens to take the keys to his mobility scooter as everyone sits around in a rather uncomfortable silence. 9.51pm: And the last batch of highlights. Verne is still hammered. He loves LaToya. So does Coolio. They reckon the girls don't like LaToya because she is old and beautiful. \"Women have been killed for their beauty since the beginning of time, bro,\" proclaims Coolio. Verne is apparently trying to make a pass at LaToya, and she is deflecting his compliments with \"Um, thank you.\" He then calls her \"a beautiful girl\", having forgotten that he and Coolio just established that she is 52, and therefore a woman. Then LaToya makes the fatal error of calling him \"cute\", and has to deal with a spot of snark before he gets back into his eulogising again. 9.53pm: Verne is driving circuits of the living room, despite having been called to the diary room. Then he attempts to bulldoze the diary room door with his mobility scooter. His head jolts alarmingly. Whiplash could set in over the next few days - be warned. Big Brother tells him that driving into the diary room could be dangerous. Verne refuses to accept this, and Big Brother can't be bothered to argue the point. In the living room, LaToya says Verne has been using many \"EX-plutives\", as opposed to \"expletives\", which normal people use. Coolio is amazed that Verne called him \"bitch\" five times today. 9.55pm: The second person to be evicted from the house is Tina. HOORAY! The housemates' upset is palpable by its absence. 9.57pm: Nobody seems to be at all bothered by Tina's exit. It's quite funny. Davina promises us another dreadful interview where no questions are asked nor answered. Join me for that particular joy in half an hour. 10.02pm: Ooh. Duncan from Blue! This is better than Jimmy bloody Carr, isn't it? 10.06pm: Plus One is AMAZING and my new favourite programme. I've just decided. It has songs, swearing and Duncan from Blue, ergo there is nothing not to like. This is a good era for late-1990s boy-band members making a comeback, obviously. Maybe J from 5ive will host a new daytime quiz show. 10.34pm: OK, we have to listen to the combined screeching of Davina and Tina now. But once this half-hour's over, we won't ever have to watch Tina again. 10.36pm: Why is Davina talking like a strangled frog? 10.38pm: We see the moment where Tina was told she was tonight's evictee. Least. Convincing. Yelp of delight. EVER. Mutya reckons she's walking tonight. We'll see. 10.40pm: Davina adopts a solemn expression to tell Mutya - who CAN'T HEAR HER, BY THE WAY - that if she leaves, she'll regret it. Anyway, it's time for Tina to leave the house to a vociferous chorus of boos, but also a top-note of celebratory whooping. \"I like yer muff!\" chuckles Davina. Oh dear me. The whole interview is going to be laden with euphemisms for the vagina, isn't it? 10.45pm: Davina welcomes us back, and the studio audience goes wild for Tina, who says she feels incredible and relieved. \"It's incredibly more intense than you'd ever imagine,\" she says. \"I'm an actor! I don't count myself as a celebrity!\" You and me both. Davina reassures her that she is VERY VERY FAMOUS NOW. Tina says she swears a lot because she likes it, which is possibly the first thing she's ever said that makes me like her a bit. 10.48pm: Tina sees Verne, Michelle and Ben nominate her. She reckons she doesn't talk over people - it's all Coolio and Terry. Tina tries to talk about Ben, and Davina talks over her, ironically, to lech over the lovely Mr Adams. 10.51pm: \"I'm loud, overbearing, opinionated, obnoxious and arrogant,\" says Tina. She refuses to believe that Coolio is at all like her, because he is not intelligent and she is. 10.53pm: We see the toned-down Tina talking about her vagina, her arse, sex, her vagina, her arse, and her vagina. 10.54pm: Tina says people expected her to have a ruck with Mutya because of their respective public perceptions, though I wasn't aware of Tina's existence before a fortnight ago. She seems to like all the other ladies. She doesn't think Tommy is famous - \"I thought it said 'Celebrity' at the top of this show\" - even though he is more famous than her. She doesn't understand why he is uncomfortable with socialising with young ladies. 10.56pm: Now we must trawl through the mire that was the Princess-from-Shrek incident. 10.58pm: Tina thinks she has learnt to be more tolerant in her two weeks in the house. Davina takes it upon herself to lionise her - she is loyal, a magnificent friend, all sorts of fluff, including enthusing about her appearance. 11pm: Montage of best bits - swearing, Tina's arse, Tina's vagina, all set to the soundtrack of Kula Shaker's Hush. Heh. 11.01pm: Davina tells us that Mutya will be leaving the house tonight. Good for her. And there'll be a surprise eviction on Monday. Whoop! Join us then. Goodnight!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
