They like all the pundits and expensive set design, the rush of the first exit poll and the nail-biting thrill of watching the results come in. To them, it\u2019s like Grand National day, except it\u2019s the entire country that will inevitably get covered with a blanket and shot at the end. For the rest of us, election night is usually one long trudge towards misery. Every time is exactly the same. The same landmarks, the same patterns, the same results. Look, I\u2019ll prove it: here\u2019s a TV schedule of exactly how this election night will go \u2026 9pm: False Hope You have just had a couple of post-work drinks, and you\u2019re convinced that it will go your way. It has to go your way, right? People aren\u2019t stupid, are they? People are never going to vote against their own interests. This is happening. This is really happening. COME ON! 9.55pm: BBC Election Night Special Hosted by Huw Edwards, stripped to the waist with a towel round his shoulders like he is on Instagram. 10.01pm: Exit Poll Results Oh. Oh no. Well that can\u2019t be right, surely. Polls are always getting this sort of thing wrong. You can\u2019t trust polls. It\u2019ll be fine. It has to be fine. 10.03pm: Quick Look at Channel 4 Jeremy Paxman is currently performing a lightly humorous monologue that was clearly written before that terrible exit poll was released. This doesn\u2019t fit the mood at all. 10.05pm: Back to BBC One Where a senior Lib Dem MP is so insistent that the polls are wrong that he\u2019s promised to eat a dirty nappy on live television if they\u2019re proved true. \u201cThat can\u2019t be a good sign,\u201d you think. 10.15pm: Jeremy Vine\u2019s New Graphics This year, Jeremy Vine predicts the election results with a cutting-edge but unfathomable kaleidoscopic pirate ship that keeps vomiting primary colours into the appalled mouth of Sir John Curtice. 11pm: False Hope: Season Finale The first brace of constituencies announce their results. They\u2019re actually quite positive! The polls were wrong after all! We\u2019re going to do this! We\u2019re really going to do this! It\u2019s coming home! It\u2019s coming home! 11.10pm: Quick Look at Sky Useless. They\u2019re just telling people how much their graphics cost over and over again, and it only looks like a Blue Peter Appeal totaliser. 11.11pm: Is ITV\u2019s Coverage Any Better? No. 12midnight: Nigel Farage Resigns And then reverses his decision, and then reverses that decision, and then that decision, too. Why is he on TV anyway? He isn\u2019t even running. What a berk. 12.30am: Laura Kuenssberg Gives Her Verdict But only so that the internet can accuse her of simultaneously being a Tory, a member of the metropolitan elite, a communist, Boris Johnson\u2019s wife and a literal space alien. 1am: Despair Results are coming in thick and fast, and it\u2019s starting to look as if the exit polls were right after all. This is going to be a drubbing. The baddies are going to win again, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. 2am: Ten White Men in Suits Talk Over Each Other for 10 Straight Minutes They\u2019re all making important points, but you\u2019re not entirely sure what any of them are. 3am: Brief Respite A cabinet minister loses his constituency to a man dressed as a rubber hippo. However, this stops being amusing as soon as the hippo says something off-colour about immigrants. 5am: The Result The election has been won, and it is just as the exit poll predicted. The whole thing has been a horrible failure and our future is now in the toilet. 6am: Despair &amp; Exhaustion Still, at least that Lib Dem guy has to eat a dirty nappy now. That\u2019s something, right? Election night coverage begins Thursday, 9.55pm, BBC One, ITV &amp; Channel 4"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
