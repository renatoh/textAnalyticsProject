The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, also revealed he had received threats relating to the \u201cbizarre\u201d theory, which has gained traction on social media. On Friday, emergency services were called to reports that a 5G mast was on fire in Liverpool shortly before 11pm. Police confirmed they were investigating the blaze at Spencer\u2019s Lane, Aintree, close to the M57 motorway. Fire crews managed to get the fire under control quickly and were photographed parked outside the field shortly after it was extinguished. The media regulator, Ofcom, said on Thursday it was monitoring broadcasters who spread the discredited conspiracy theory, although coverage has spread more widely on social networks, such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Nextdoor. Speaking at Saturday\u2019s Downing Street press conference, cabinet secretary Michael Gove said the theories were \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d. Professor Steve Powis, national medical director of NHS England, condemned them as \u201cthe worst kind of fake news\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely outraged, absolutely disgusted, that people would be taking action against the very infrastructure that we need to respond to this health emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is absolute and utter rubbish.\u201d Just hours before the reported incident in Liverpool, Anderson dismissed the theories as \u201cbizarre\u201d. He said he was amazed by the amount of traction the conspiracy was getting on social media, and that all scientific and government advice showed the technology posed no harm to people. Speaking to the Guardian, the mayor revealed he had received threats relating to the theory and had reported them to Merseyside police. \u201cThe suggestion that Covid-19 is somehow linked to 5G is patently beyond the realms of credibility \u2013 utterly bizarre,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Liverpool these masts are being upgraded and ironically the very people that are using this technology are the ones who are believing these theories. I was mildly threatened yesterday by someone telling me to take them down. \u201cThe reality is there is huge pressure on the network at the moment with so many people at home and that\u2019s why engineers are upgrading it. The idea that I have entered into some kind of machiavellian plot with the government is ridiculous.\u201d Social media posts from celebrities, such as the singer Anne-Marie, have helped spread the theory, while Amanda Holden, a judge on Britain\u2019s Got Talent, shared a link to an online petition promoting the false rumour that the symptoms of coronavirus are caused by residing near a 5G mast. The petition was removed following inquiries from the Guardian. Cheers actor Woody Harrelson and former Dancing on Ice judge Jason Gardiner are also among stars who have shared theories. The government is increasingly concerned about the impact of the spread of such false theories. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, which has responsibility for telecoms policy, warned people to stop damaging key infrastructure during a national emergency: \u201cThese are baseless theories, there is absolutely no credible evidence of a link between 5G and coronavirus. Threats or violence towards any key worker or damage to mobile phone masts will not be tolerated.\u201d On Thursday, police in Belfast appealed for information after a mobile phone mast was damaged in an arson attack, with online footage suggesting the motive was opposition to 5G networks. The video clip shows an incident on the Antrim Road in north Belfast on Thursday night, in which flames can be seen at the base of a mobile telephone mast. According to a report in the Irish News, voices can be heard stating \u201cFuck the 5G\u201d and \u201cViva la revolution\u201d as the fire burns. Facebook removed one anti-5G group in which members were being encouraged to supply footage of them destroying mobile phone equipment. Video footage of a 70ft (20m) telephone mast on fire in Birmingham this week has also circulated widely alongside claims it was targeted by anti-5G protesters. The problem has become so bad that engineers working for Openreach, which provides home broadband services, have posted pleas on anti-5G Facebook groups, asking to be spared from on-street abuse as they are not involved in maintaining mobile networks. The industry lobby group Mobile UK said the incidents were affecting efforts to maintain networks that were supporting home working and providing critical connectivity to the emergency services, vulnerable consumers and hospitals. Telecoms engineers are considered key workers under the government\u2019s guidelines. International radiation experts have repeatedly made clear that the new high-speed telephone system does not pose a risk to humans, while pointing out that the coronavirus has spread widely in many countries without any 5G coverage, such as Iran."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
