What is shocking, however, is the revelation that balanced on the lectern he keeps not a leather bound tome but his iPad \u2013 containing not the complete works of Trollope, but an advance copy of Matthew Blakstad\u2019s internet paranoia novel, Sockpuppet. \u201cI prefer to read on the iPad now,\u201d he said in a Radio Times interview (conducted, he revealed, from another dangerously up-to-date bit of kit, a rolling stand-up desk: \u201cSitting down is the new smoking apparently. As I\u2019m talking to you now I\u2019m wobbling around the kitchen.\u201d) The grumpiest national treasure was on more familiar harrumphing form with his views of social media: \u201cI do not do Facebook or Twitter. I am anti the sort of idiocies that Twitter frequently produces and baffled by people who feel they\u2019ve got to be telling everybody what they\u2019re doing all the time. If I want to hear what ordinary people think then I will talk to them in a pub. Twitter is utterly pointless.\u201d Drinking proved another provocative question. \u201cNever during the day. I\u2019m very happy to have a pint in the evening, but I like bitter, not that abomination, lager. I used to drink a lot when I was a kid, but I\u2019m past the stage where the purpose of drinking is getting drunk.\u201d Given his dawn starts for the Today programme on Radio 4, where the 73-year-old has been a presenter since 1987, he goes to bed at half past eight, and so hardly ever sees live television, apart from watching Wales play rugby with his 15-year-old son. He recorded and enjoyed Dickensian and War &amp; Peace, but insisted: \u201cWith the exception of the utterly brilliant Mastermind I could manage without television completely.\u201d (Mastermind is presented by one J Humphrys Esq.) Despite the iPad, he estimates that he owns more than a thousand books, which are shelved in his combined library and gym, complete with weight training equipment and a rowing machine. He keeps Mozart and Bach on his laptop, but listens to nothing during his favourite exercise, running, which he regards as an effective mind-clearer and time for thought: \u201cI\u2019m baffled by why people would want to cover their ears and listen to something. I mean, why would you?\u201d He took grave exception to the implication that he could be behind the times. \u201cI\u2019ve been online 10 to 15 years; it\u2019s a wonderful way to access information. So I am not outside that world \u2013 please don\u2019t give that impression.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
