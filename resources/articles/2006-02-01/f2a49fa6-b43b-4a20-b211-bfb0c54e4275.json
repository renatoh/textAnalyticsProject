Currently acting leader and the candidate backed by over half the parliamentary party, Sir Menzies questioned Mr Huhne's judgment as he emphasised his own maturity and experience. Sir Menzies' criticism comes after indications that the frontrunner mantle has passed from the 64-year-old MP for North East Fife to the newly elected MP for Eastleigh. With just five days of voting to go both Sir Menzies Campbell and third-placed candidate Simon Hughes told GMTV that there was still everything to play for. Two weeks ago in the high-profile BBC Question Time hustings the normally mild mannered Sir Menzies sarcastically referred to Mr Huhne's \"modesty\", suggesting that the former frontrunner was rattled by his rival's campaign. In an interview to be broadcast on GMTV on Sunday, Sir Menzies insisted he was still \"optimistic but not complacent\" about victory. In an apparent swipe at his main rival, he described Chris Huhne as a \"media darling\" while emphasising his own qualities of \"experience, maturity and judgement\". \"Chris Huhne appears to have been the darling of the media but then he is a former journalist and perhaps that's understandable,\" he said. \"But we have sought, as far as we possibly can in our campaign, to emphasise the qualities of experience and maturity and judgment, the need for unity and purpose and professionalism in what we do.\" Sir Menzies continued: \"Mr Huhne did say that he would support me then he came to me to say that he wished to run himself. \"That's a matter for his own judgment and of course that's a matter for his own credibility.\" In answer to concerns about his age, Sir Menzies said: \"The leading candidate to have the Republican nomination for the next presidential election in the United States is Senator John McCain who as we speak is age 69.\" \"If you can run the United States at age 69 then I think you can run the Liberal Democrats at age 64.\" Last night the three candidates spoke at the final hustings in London where all appeared tired after weeks of meetings on the campaign trail. The party's 73,000 members are voting for their new leader by a postal ballot. The winner will be announced next Thursday - the day before the Lib Dem spring conference."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
