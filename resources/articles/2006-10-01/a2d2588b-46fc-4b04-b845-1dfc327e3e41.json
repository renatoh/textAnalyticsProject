Shona Beattie's husband, Flight Sergeant Stephen Beattie, 42, died when a Nimrod MR2 aircraft crashed on September 2. Eleven other crew from 120 Squadron at RAF Kinloss died in the crash, as did a Royal Marine and an army soldier. Mrs Beattie yesterday told BBC Radio Scotland that her husband, a weapons systems operator from Dundee, had been concerned at the level of cutbacks being made within the air force, particularly in relation to ground fleet coverage. She said the cutbacks could put lives at risk. She told the BBC: \"There has to be investment in the ground crew of the servicing for the Nimrods and maintaining the flying crews as they are. They have already cut back 206 Squadron which Steve was strongly affiliated to and they are being stretched and stretched and stretched. They talk about 'leaning' the air force, you can only lean something so far. Those in ministerial powers who have budgets, please direct it to the Nimrod fleet.\" Speaking on behalf of the Ministry of Defence, Air Vice-Marshal Iain McNicoll said: \"At this stage, the indications are that the accident was caused by a technical failure, but we must wait for the Board of Inquiry to report ... Over the past two years, we have increased the amount spent on Nimrod aircraft maintenance by 50%, from \u00a32m to \u00a33m per aircraft per year.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
