Before moving on to the action and tips for today it's worth reflecting on yesterday's extraordinary Tote Scoop6 outcome which resulted in the big-money bet going begging for the umpteenth week. There is likely to be something in the region of \u00a35m up for grabs next Saturday now and the syndicates who have traditionally dominated in the past must be running out of cash. The races the Tote choose are going to be fascinating as the major races next weekend are the Betfair Chase in which Kauto Star will be a raging odds-on shot and the Peterborough Chase in which there are usually less runners than people who can squeeze into a phone box. There must be a doubt they will make the cut. Today's Guardian nap is Aigle D'Or 2.20pm at Cheltenham. There has been plenty of whispers for this one and he should go well. The 2-1 on offer is not a wallet-expanding price, however, and the tip today is to back Moon Over Miami (1.45pm) who is also the subject of good reports but is around 7-2. The word from our correspondent at the track is that there has been more rain this morning and Moon Over Miami loves soft ground and Cheltenham's unique contours. 2.25pm Woe for Walsh as Tatenen is on target Tatenen continued to look a chaser destined for the very top with an easy win in the opener at Cheltenham but it's not good news for Ruby Walsh who would have ridden the winner but for a crashing fall at the meeting yesterday. Walsh has had to have his spleen removed after being kicked by his mount and while the jockey's agent is talking three to six weeks out the feeling is that it could be much longer. Tatenen will run next at Leopardstown at Christmas before returning to Cheltenham for the Festival in March according to trainer Paul Nicholls. The winner wasn't seriously tested today with runner-up Straw Bear never getting into contention but he could not have won any easier and he looks very high quality. 2.40pm Hardy has last laugh Old-timer Hardy Eustace wins the big race at Punchestown. It must be desperate ground over in Ireland for the veteran to win at this level at the minimum two-mile trip and not a lot should be read into this result with Jered not ideally suited by the heavy surface and Sizing Europe likely to much better for his comeback run. At Cheltenham Numide just gets the better of Aigle D'Or, the pair heading the betting having the finish to themselves. This is usually a race that throws up top-class performers and Numide, as Tom Segal pointed out in his Racing Post Pricewise column today, looks the sort for the Tote Gold Trophy at Newbury in February.
