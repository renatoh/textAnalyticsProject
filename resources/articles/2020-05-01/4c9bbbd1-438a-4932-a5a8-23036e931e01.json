Top stories Global greenhouse emissions are expected to slump this year as shutdowns make their impact across the world, but Australia\u2019s own electricity grid appears unaffected. An analysis by Hugh Saddler, who writes a monthly national emissions audit for the Australia Institute, found the reduced economic activity over a five-week period was likely to have cut emissions from the country\u2019s coal-dominated power generation by only about 1%. Australia can expect to see a significant fall in emissions from both road transport and aviation, though. Saddler said Australia differed from some of the worst-affected countries in that major energy users in Australia, such as mining, mineral processing and manufacturing operations, had mostly stayed open during lockdown. Australians are increasingly comfortable with easing Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, the latest Guardian Essential Poll shows. The poll comes as Victoria announces an easing of restrictions, and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, prepares to update parliament on the gains to gross domestic product if governments roll out the full, three-stage agreement to end lockdowns signed off by the national cabinet last week. The treasurer says stage one \u2013 which involves reopening retail outlets and schools and permits cafes and restaurants to seat 10 patrons \u2013 will boost GDP by $3.1bn. Concern about the threat of the virus increased, with 49% of respondents saying they are quite concerned, compared with 46% last week. The Trump administration\u2019s inconsistent handling of the Covid-19 pandemic continues, with Mike Pence avoiding quarantine despite his own press secretary testing positive. Pence, who refused to wear a face mask during a visit to a hospital last week, plans to continue working at the White House and \u201ccontinues to test negative every single day\u201d, according to his spokesperson. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has claimed coronavirus numbers \u201care going down almost everywhere\u201d in the US, but in truth numbers are decreasing in just 14 states out of 50. In the UK, Boris Johnson is under attack for muddled messaging as he laid out plans to reopen parts of the British economy. MPs in the Commons criticised the change of the government\u2019s message from \u201cstay at home\u201d to \u201cstay alert\u201d. Australia We have a long way to go to get Australia\u2019s economy back on track, writes Greg Jericho. Even with strong growth, the economy is not expected to be the size it was at the end of last year until March 2022. Australia\u2019s tertiary sector has been hit especially hard by Covid-19, as overseas student numbers have plummeted. But moving course content online is only the beginning for universities, which expect to lose up to 21,000 jobs and will have to remodel their offerings to provide new short courses and continue to attract international students. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says he will be disappointed if China\u2019s plan to impose tariffs on Australian barley imports was linked to the recent coronavirus stoush. The government has signalled it would take the dispute to the World Trade Organization should China follow through with planned duties of around 80%. The world New research shows that Neanderthals and humans coexisted in Europe for much longer than previously thought. Researchers say remains and tools found in Bulgaria reveal modern humans and Neanderthals were present at the same time for several thousand years, giving them ample time for biological and cultural interaction.

British refugees travelled to Heathrow to greet their family members after the flight brought 47 people from Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan. Recommended reads \u201cStay four koalas apart\u201d is the catchy message promoting social distancing at Sydney University\u2019s veterinary teaching hospital. The beginning of a new shift involves interns at the hospital handing over notes in a historic animal inspection building where there is enough room for everyone to gather without getting too close. \u201cIt was a place where the students in my day used to celebrate the end of their faculty dinners with a keg into the wee hours, so it\u2019s got a lot of sentimental value,\u201d says the hospital\u2019s CEO, Dr Mark Lawrie. Alyx Gorman visits the hospital\u2019s staff members and furry patients to find out how the coronavirus pandemic has affected the veterinary world. The Stream Team rewatch Bio-Dome, a 1996 gross-out comedy that Kylie Minogue describes as her worst career move. Starring Pauly Shore and a lesser Baldwin, the 1996 comedy is full of terrible jokes \u2013 and surprisingly salient lessons that might apply to our current situation. And Josh Taylor looks at what\u2019s driving anti-lockdown protests in Australia. Mimicking the protests seen in America, small groups of Australians have gathered in major cities, blaming 5G and Bill Gates for the coronavirus. The protests are largely organised through Facebook groups focused on fringe conspiracy theories such as QAnon and anti-vaxx culture. Axel Bruns, a professor in digital media research at Queensland University of Technology, tells Guardian Australia the pandemic is bringing wildly differing conspiracy theory groups together. \u201cAny group with pre-existing conspiracy theories has projected their conspiracy theories on to the corona crisis in some form as well,\u201d he said Listen Guardian Australia\u2019s Full Story podcast looks at how Covid-19 is affecting women\u2019s experience of work and making gender inequality more visible. When it comes to unpaid housework and caring duties, Australian women are among the most overworked in the world. They\u2019re also overrepresented in low-paid jobs on the frontline of Covid-19 \u2013 such as aged care, childcare and disability support work. Full Story is Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast.
