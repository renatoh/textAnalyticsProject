While no business case or environmental impact statements are yet complete, project managers have been appointed and calls for tender went out in June. Guardian Australia has been told by multiple sources that the cost of the project to raise the dam wall at the junction of the Lachlan and Abercrombie rivers, 48km from Cowra in NSW, has doubled due in part to the huge amount of environmental offsets that will be needed to compensate for the impact of the scheme. The Wyangala project and two others \u2013 Dungowan dam near Tamworth and Mole Creek dam \u2013 were first announced by the prime minister NSW premier in October 2019 at the height of the drought, when there were fears some towns could run out of water. They are now being fast-tracked through the NSW planning process as state-significant infrastructure. Asked about the cost blowout, a spokesman for WaterNSW \u2013 the state government agency responsible for the project \u2013 said: \u201cThe proposed project to raise the Wyangala dam wall is in its early investigative and preliminary planning stages. Cost estimates will be clear once the final business case and environmental and cultural assessments are completed next year.\u201d WaterNSW said the final decision on the dams has not been taken, but it has already appointed engineers Aurecon and KBR as project managers and in June called for tenders for construction at Wyangala. This is despite there being no business cases and no environmental impact assessments for any of the three dam projects. The federal government doubled its contribution in the September 2020 budget to $325m toward Wyangala and a further $242m toward Dungowan dam, despite the lack of any project assessments. It has also converted the funds from a loan to a grant to NSW. The projects have been championed by state and federal Nationals MPs including the federal Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, who is also the infrastructure minister and whose seat will be the main beneficiary of the Wyangala project. \u201cWe know the economic road out of this pandemic relies on funding major infrastructure to support local communities and create jobs and these dam projects will do exactly that,\u201d McCormack said. But water experts and environmentalists describe the state government process around the Wyangala project as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and \u201cabsolutely terrible\u201d for the environment. The project will double the dam\u2019s capacity by adding 650GL but will inundate a large area of valuable farmland and destroy critically endangered ecological communities as well as having major downstream impacts on six important wetlands which are habitats for native and migratory birds. \u201cIt\u2019s an entirely improper process,\u201d said the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists\u2019 spokesman, Jamie Pittock, a professor in the Fenner School of Environment and Society at the Australian National University. \u201cThis project is a captain\u2019s pick. The dam proponents have greatly exaggerated the benefits and the costs have been grossly underestimated,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no coherent cost-benefit analysis.\u201d The dam would also destroy a number of important Indigenous sites, which in the wake of the destruction of Juukan Gorge by Rio Tinto would be controversial, said Emma Carmody, the Environmental Defenders Office\u2019s special counsel. \u201cRaising the dam wall will have significant environmental impacts, including on wetlands that provide habitat for migratory and other threatened species. It will also \u2013 unforgivably \u2013 result in the destruction of cultural heritage sites. The Environmental Defenders Office is therefore assessing the legality of the project from a variety of angles,\u201d she said. An Upper Calare Wiradjuri elder, Jenny Coe Munro, said her people had several important sacred sites along the river, many of which they did not talk about publicly. The lack of a business case and scientific studies has prompted a parliamentary inquiry in NSW, chaired by the Greens\u2019 Cate Faehrmann. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace that the minister [Melinda Pavey] continues to use the emergency situation that a number of regional towns found themselves in during the drought last year to avoid any scrutiny of this project,\u201d Faehrmann said. \u201cThis is a huge amount of money to spend at this point in time, and the public deserves to know whether it spells good value for money during a pandemic and in a climate emergency.\u201d \u201cThe minister is intent on fast-tracking this project, despite a suite of other options for water security in the region being now out on public exhibition.\u201d The Guardian approached Melinda Pavey for comment and she referred questions to WaterNSW. Pittock told the inquiry this week that Wyangala dam has only spilled twice in the past decade and climate change could may make such events less frequent. Yet the proposal was to raise the dam wall and double the storage by 650GL when the required additional water was just 21GL, he said. The cost of generating this extra water by building a dam would be an \u201cexorbitant\u201d $30,000 a ML, which compares to $1,100 a ML, the price general water entitlements in the Lachlan are now trading at. Pittock said water savings could be achieved far more cheaply and at less cost to the environment by much smaller projects, such as building weirs, on-farm storages and by providing irrigators with funds to upgrade their infrastructure. Pittock was also highly critical of the argument that the dam wall raising was necessary to ensure town water supplies. He said water utilities held just 2% of the entitlements in the Lachlan. \u201cThe problem is the mismanagement of the Lachlan,\u201d he said. \u201cNSW runs the catchment on a credit system, not a debit system [the system used in most rivers]. This means that water is allocated, not on the basis of what is in the storage, but what is expected to flow into the dam. \u201cSo in dry periods WaterNSW could have let too much water be taken.\u201d WaterNSW has also argued the dam will mitigate flooding at Forbes. But Pittock said this argument was \u201cutter garbage\u201d because three existing flood management plans for the town had found the main problem was a railway easement, which is currently being upgraded for the federal government\u2019s inland freight line. The environmental impact statement is due to be put on exhibition in June 2021, but ancillary works at Wyangala are due to start around now, with full construction planned for October 2021."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
