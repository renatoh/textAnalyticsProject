Then, after winning last year's Wimbledon, following a successful defence of the Australian Open, she spent a year out of the sport. This was because of injuries to both feet, which were said to have led to life-threatening complications with a blood clot on each lung, sustained when she stepped on some broken glass in a Munich restaurant. She needed 18 stitches in total, as well as surgery on a lacerated tendon that caused her toe to droop. In short, it was all very nasty. But despite the $6.5m hit to her earnings caused by the incident, the restaurant that put one of the sport's greatest players out for a year has never been identified, let alone sued. This is all a bit strange, since Bild, a German tabloid every bit as voracious in its appetite for celebrity news as our own red tops, is based in Munich and, despite making inquiries, has never found anyone who knew of the incident. These facts, as well as her having played against Kim Clijsters in Belgium the following day, and that she was photographed five days later in high heels and with a sticky plaster on top of her foot, have led people to ask questions. So many questions, in fact, that Williams has felt obliged to respond. \"It's unfortunate I had to have surgery, but I'm not lying or denying, because it is what it is,\" Williams told USA Today in February. There will be more questions after her first-round match against France's Aravane Reza\u00ef here . Met targets match-fixing Metropolitan police officers are standing by to arrest suspected match-fixers at the All England Championships over the next fortnight. Superintendent Pete Dobson, the ground commander at Wimbledon, confirmed he holds regular meetings with the Tennis Integrity Unit, based in nearby Roehampton. Jeff Rees, the TIU's head and himself a former Scotland Yard detective, is on hand to pursue any suggestions of irregular betting. The police will not confront those trying to beat the odds by gaming with laptop and mobile technologies before on-court events are updated on the betting exchanges. But there is a clear mandate to act in the event of suspected match-fixing. \"It can become a criminal offence if it goes towards influencing matches,\" said Dobson this morning. \"Two years ago there was such an incident. But sometimes people put forward false intelligence to put people off their game. We have to be really careful we test the intelligence to make sure it comes from more than one source.\" Dobson did reveal his source in one important area of policing for the Championships: stalkers. \"We liaise with the Women's Tennis Association,\" added Dobson, while pointing out that there have been no specific threats to players relating to their time at these championships. \"Certain players are followed around Wimbledon by some fixated individuals. It does tend to be the women players.\" Murray's Haye decision Andy Murray has a ticket for David Haye's world heavyweight championship fight against Wladimir Klitschko, below, in Hamburg on 2 July, the night before the men's final at Wimbledon. Doubtless the mere mention of the Scot having an outside interest will have Middle England's outraged tennis set complaining about his lack of commitment to the task of becoming the first Briton to win the tournament for 75 years. But the Murray-bashers should be aware that this is merely an open offer from Haye, the British tennis No1 and boxing nut Murray's big pal. Clearly Murray's first commitment will be to the tennis, although he will be watching the bout live, even if he cannot get along."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
