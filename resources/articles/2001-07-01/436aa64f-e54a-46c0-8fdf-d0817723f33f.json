His blue rolling hills offer a convincing Home Counties alternative to the rugged, real ones outside. Ian Forrest's elegantly economical production transports us to a verdant country garden, where the vicar always calls and a vivacious young bluestocking can be found brushing up her logarithms. Vivie Warren is just down from Cambridge, awaiting the return of her long-absent mother. All seems set for the politest passage of Shavian intercourse until it emerges that Mrs Warren has made her fortune by running the best little whorehouse in Brussels. This was all too much for the English stage in 1893. The play had to wait for 30 years for its first public performance, and a pioneering US company was arrested en masse after the premiere in New York. Even an erstwhile champion, William Archer, complained that Shaw \"couldn't touch pitch without rolling around in it\". No one wanted to hear the P-word on stage, and the irony was that neither did Shaw. At the crucial moment of revelation, Vivie Warren cannot even bring herself to name her mother's profession, so she writes it down. Everything is implied - from the tacit understanding that good society turns a blind eye where wealth is concerned, to the fact that brothel-keeping represented the sole extent of the business opportunities available to working-class Victorian women. Exquisitely arrayed in fashionable silks, Sara Coward gives a great, fighting performance as a defiant harridan who refuses to have her entrepreneurial spirit held hostage by conventional morality. Mariah Gough succeeds well in the harder task of finding sympathy for the priggish Vivie, whose fine education has been underwritten by her mother's enterprise. Peter Yapp is suitably louche as Mrs Warren's disreputable business partner: the demonic presence of this port-pickled, clubbable lecher confirms all of Shaw's most ingrained prejudices. Prostitution he could accept - what he really couldn't bear was a capitalist. In rep until October 26.
