Cook mushrooms and garlic in the butter gently, adding enough breadcrumbs to make a dampish stuffing. Sear the steaks quickly on both sides in a heavy pan which has been rubbed over with lard. Put some stuffing in the middle of a piece of pastry, then a steak, and some more stuffing. Repeat with the other steaks. Brush the pastry edges with beaten egg yolk and form turnovers. Brush the top, and bake for 20 minutes at gas-mark 6."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
