The caretaker coach Stuart Lancaster intends to delay making an appointment until the end of the month but Dallaglio believes Wood is best equipped to inherit the job from Lewis Moody. Dallaglio firmly believes back-row forwards make good captains and has seen enough of the 25-year-old Wood to suspect he has a lengthy England career ahead of him. \"Tom Wood's in a better position simply because he's spent more time in the England team,\" said Dallaglio, an ambassador for the 2015 Rugby World Cup being staged in England. \"He probably just shades it ahead of Chris Robshaw because of that. \"You hope Robshaw goes on and fulfils his potential but you'll only know that once he's been in that environment. Mysteriously or not, Tom was left out of the team to face France [in the World Cup quarter-final last October] and I thought England were underpowered. He certainly fits the bill if that's the sort of person Stuart Lancaster wants.\" Dallaglio, like everyone else, is intrigued to find out how many newcomers Lancaster will pick in his 32-man Six Nations squad to be unveiled on Wednesday. He reckons there is enough talent, untried or not, for England to have a chance of retaining the title they won last year. \"It's going to be a real challenge but with that comes opportunity. Clearly everyone knows that the performances in New Zealand were not what they needed to be but retaining their Six Nations title is not beyond the bounds of possibility. The announcement of the squad and the training camp in Yorkshire will be critical. To get things right on the field, you have to get them right off it.\" He also cautions against throwing too many young players into the squad and not bothering about short-term results. \"We can sit here and talk about England's prospects in 2015 but they are also linked to what happens in the next 12 months because the seedings will depend on the world rankings at the end of 2012. The 12 Tests this year will go a long way towards determining England's draw. Whilst performance and development are the current buzzwords, results are also key because we're outside the top four.\" As for the correct back-row balance, Dallaglio says picking the right No8 will be critical. \"It's not just about your physical attributes. Mentally you're part of the spine of the team and the ball comes to your feet quite a lot during the game. Your ability to impact the game is greater than other people's, so it is a key position. It sets the tone and example for the rest of the team as to how you're going to play the game. There's no reason why someone like Robshaw couldn't assume that role, with Wood and someone else on the flanks. You could even look at Croft as a second-row, as long as you've got some ballast to go with him. It's more difficult to make gym monkeys into footballers than vice versa.\" The RWC 2015 organisers concede they are banking on a successful challenge from the host nation to promote the tournament. They are hoping to sell almost 3m tickets, over twice as many as in 2011, and Monday saw the opening of their headquarters directly across the road from the stadium in Twickenham. \"England playing well helps us but we can't rely on it,\" said Paul Vaughan, the tournament chief executive. The International Rugby Board chief executive, Mike Miller, said he supports the idea of Premiership matches being played during the knock-out stages of the tournament but firm plans are on hold until the dates are confirmed in March. \"I've absolutely no doubt we can deliver the best World Cup yet,\" said Vaughan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
