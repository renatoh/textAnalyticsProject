It is a period of erotic adventure, social comedy and terrible tragedy in her life, during which she is starting to write the stories which will make her immortal. In February 1915, Katherine runs away from John Middleton Murry in London and wangles her way into the French warzone to visit her lover Francis Carco, a Corsican poet working as a messenger with the troops near Chteaudun. Caf\u00e9 life and Surrealist parties in Paris with her friend Beatrice Hastings follow that reckless fling. But playing on the edge of war is all changed by the death of Katherine's beloved younger brother Leslie, killed in action. Everything that follows - quiet days in the villa at Bandol with Murry, writing \"The Aloe\", her story of her New Zealand childhood; their stormy communal life with the Lawrences in Cornwall; her edge-on incursions into Bloomsbury, flirting with Carrington, Ottoline Morrell, Bertrand Russell, and Eliot, and arguing over Sassoon's pacifism - is shadowed by the irrevocable effects of Leslie's death. This part of her story draws to a close as she makes another, more dangerous journey through wartime France, back to a much-changed Bandol for the winter, where, writing alone by the Mediterranean, she sees the first signs of her tuberculosis. CK Stead is trying to do to Katherine Mansfield what Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn has just done to Henry James in The Master or Michael Cunningham to Virginia Woolf in The Hours: to take a short section of a great writer's life, extrapolate its essence from biographical information and primary sources, and turn it into a vivid, immediate fictional narrative which daringly enters into the famous subject's inner life. He ought to be well placed to do this. Stead is a distinguished New Zealand poet, novelist and teacher of literature who has edited Mansfield's journals. He knows her work and her country inside out, and draws on it in detail for his book. And he has a strong idea of her. In his 1977 introduction to his selection of her letters and jour nals, he described her as a chameleon, a role-player, who is at her truest not when she is being \"sensitive\" but when she is \"satirical, or bullying, or simply plain and factual\". What he likes best in the work is her \"robust, anarchic intelligence\" and her \"comic talent\". He sees her as someone who, however fearful and vulnerable, could \"put herself together again\" through her writing. The Mansfield he presents here, though often despairing, lonely and confused, is also satirical, sharp, funny and courageous. It was a cunning move to bring her friend Fred Goodyear (a minor figure in the biographies) into the centre of the picture. Goodyear, an English friend of Murry's, seems to have been in love with Katherine, and wrote her some critical letters about her contempt for other people and her need to \"re-unite\" with humanity. Stead imagines him in the horrors of the Front (where he lost both legs, and died) receiving a long letter from Katherine which spells out her need not to let \"false notes\" creep in, \"better honest about what I see around me\". It's the novel's most interesting invention, bringing the realities of the war right into the centre of the story, and emphasising the tough self-knowledge, as a writer, which underlay all Mansfield's contradictory, often wilful performances. But, for all its author's fine qualifications and its alluring subject, unfortunately Mansfield doesn't come off. You have the sinking feeling that this isn't going to work from the novel's first scene, where Katherine walks away from a London party with TS Eliot and says to him: \"You want to be alone. You're a poet, after all.\" Eliot is made to say things such as: \"It suits my pose as an anti-Romantic Modern.\" As the famous personages troop on, one by one, they demonstrate their characteristics to us in similarly explicit fashion. Frieda tells Katherine that Lawrence's theory of sex is that \"You should climax together.\" Katherine can see that \"Life with Lawrence can be rough.\" Ottoline gushes, Virginia Woolf (\"cat-like\", of course) talks intensely about literature, Carrington gossips about sex, and Bertrand Russell tells Katherine: \"When I didn't understand Wittgenstein I always had a feeling it was my fault.\" It is like one of those old biopics of, say, the Russian revolution. (\"Ah, Lenin! I want you to meet Trotsky.\") But perhaps I am the wrong reader for this book: too suspicious of fictionalised biographies, and too familiar with this particular slice of literary history. Or perhaps Mansfield is simply too strong for her re-creator. Whenever Stead's loose version of Mansfield's journals and letters is set against the originals, he comes off worse. Of her nights with Carco, she says in her journal: \"The act of love seemed quite incidental, we talked so much.\" Stead has, banally: \"They spent the night talking (a great deal), making love (effortlessly, cosily).\" The heartbreaking passage in her diary when, after Leslie's death, she returns to \"The Aloe\" and dedicates herself to writing about \"their country\" for his sake (\"It simply fascinates me, and I know that it is what you would wish me to write ... My little brother, it is good, and it is what we really meant\") is watered down to: \"This was better than anything else she'd written. And wasn't it what she'd promised Leslie she would do, and had gone on promising his ghost?\" At the end, Stead has Mansfield seeing the arterial blood she has coughed up - like Keats and Chekhov - and telling herself: \"I must work ... The book must be finished.\" It is an honourable tribute to a woman of genius who had to do battle with the horrible disease that killed her at the age of 34. But it's no substitute for her own, unparaphrasable, terrible words. Better to go back to the original: \"Oh yes, of course I'm frightened ... I shan't have my work written. That's what matters. How unbearable it would be to die - leave 'scraps', 'bits' ... nothing real finished.\" \u00b7 Hermione Lee's books include Virginia Woolf (Vintage).
