The quintessential Tyke combines the lovably \"refreshing\" views of Sir Bernard Ingham and Jeremy Clarkson, the diplomacy of Harvey Smith and Chubby Brown and the unassuming traits of Naseem Hamed and Brian Clough. But there is another type of Yorkshireman, one which stands apart from the preening cynics who deliver \"I say what I mean and I mean what I bloody well say\" tripe with smug self-congratulation plastered across their faces. I am thinking of Jarvis Cocker, Barry Cryer and, among the sporting fraternity, Darren Gough, the cricketer who will bring his thrilling first-class career to an end next week. I had heard about Gough long before seeing him bowl, and when I first saw him trundling up the hill at Headingley I could not believe this portly medium-pacer would ever become the saviour of Yorkshire cricket. I knew someone who played with him for Barnsley in the Yorkshire League and the word was that he was a carefree and undaunted spirit, one who gave the curmudgeons who sat beyond the boundary rope short shrift. The best example of the mean-spiritedness that prevailed among certain elements of the Yorkshire crowd is Sir Michael Parkinson's anecdote about Sir Leonard Hutton's son, Richard, an England all-rounder, who was told by one uncharitable dimwit as he walked out to bat: \"Tha'll never be as good as thi dad.\" A fair point, indeed, but as Parky pointed out: \"Who will ever be as good as his dad?\" Gough, by contrast, when still a teenager, did not shrink when one spectator with luxuriant sideburns heckled him when he was dismissed after playing a rash shot. He told the \"fat Elvis bastard\" precisely where to go. It is difficult to overstate how bad Yorkshire cricket was until Gough came along. In the 1970s and 80s, the club was mired in the Boycott wars and an obsession with past glories. Nostalgics talked about charismatic characters like Fred Trueman and Brian Close and pointed to the obvious shortcomings of the brittle and diffident Chris Old and the enigmatic Jim Love. Every few years there would be a promising discovery, such as Paul Jarvis, whose youthful vigour and talent would be crushed by the weight of expectation. Perhaps Gough would have gone the same way had it not been for the advice of a team-mate, Richie Richardson, who encouraged him to forget about the outmoded and traditionally English art of military-medium seam and swing bowling and strive for genuine pace. To do that he had to hurtle to the wicket at full pelt and propel his body through the crease like a javelin-thrower coming up to the mark. Over the course of a season he went from yeoman to Younis and started producing the low, skiddy, inswinging yorkers that Waqar had made his trademark in the early 90s. His England career got off to a bright start but the injury he sustained in a one-day match after taking six for 49 against Australia in the 1995 Sydney Test set him back for a couple of years. Still, Gough had the speed and variation in length to trouble the best batsmen in all conditions, like he did in Sri Lanka in 2001, and the self-belief to back himself to bamboozle anyone with his array of slower balls. In Australia in 1998-99, when England started as badly as they had done four years earlier, he was the one player exempted from the Australian crowd's injunction to \"show some ticker, you pommie pooftahs\". The way he concluded his hat-trick in the fifth Test by skittling Stuart MacGill and Colin Miller was truly inspirational. In Gough, England had someone capable of providing the most captivating spectacle in cricket. He seemed to say: \"Stuff your caught Healy, bowled McGrath - we've got a stump destroyer.\" If his knee holds up and his showbiz schedule allows it, Gough says he could be persuaded to play Twenty20 in the winter and even into next season, so this is more a farewell than a goodbye. In those drab years between Botham's pomp and the millennium, after which Nasser Hussain and Duncan Fletcher began to restore England's credibility, Gough gave us hope. The endeavour was always conspicuous, the pride evident in the way he puffed out his chest, and, above all, the determination to enjoy himself was there in the amiable cockiness and the dazzling smile that gave him his nickname. After years of pessimism for Yorkshire and England players and fans he made it a game again, and for that we should be thankful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
