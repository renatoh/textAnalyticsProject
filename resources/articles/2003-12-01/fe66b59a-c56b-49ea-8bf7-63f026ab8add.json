The Newcastle and England fly-half was taken to hospital for x-rays after aggravating a shoulder injury in the Falcons' 23-19 Zurich Premiership win over Northampton at Kingston Park. It was his first game since helping England to World Cup glory five weeks ago and it was feared another lay-off could make him doubtful for England's clash with Italy in seven weeks. But Andrew told Radio 5 Live: \"He's fine, the x-ray has shown that there's no further damage to the break. Clearly there is soft-tissue damage from a very heavy tackle. \"It's a bit early to say at this stage how long he will be out, probably the next 48 hours will tell. I don't expect him to miss the Six Nations. He may well not play next week but we're talking a few weeks probably rather than anything serious.\" The news will comfort England coach Clive Woodward during his Christmas skiing holiday in Switzerland, particularly after Bath centre Mike Tindall was ruled out of England's Grand Slam defence earlier in the day. Tindall ruptured all three of the lateral ligaments in his right ankle in yesterday's win over Saracens and he will undergo an operation this week before then embarking on a 12-week rehabilitation programme. Wilkinson looked set to join him on the sidelines as he was helped off early in the second half at Kingston Park after falling in a heap while attempting a tackle. Andrew explained: \"He led with his head which twisted to one side. It has affected the area he had the fracture in but it hasn't caused any further damage. He could have gone five or six weeks without such an injury, it's just that it's happened on the day of his return. \"He's pretty fed up, as you would expect from anyone who has missed the last five weeks since the World Cup. He's been desperate to play. The one knock that we hoped he wouldn't get today to unsettle the area is the one that he's had so he's pretty frustrated and disappointed. \"But it goes with the territory. It's a very tough physical sport. We just need to let it settle for a couple of days before we know the extent of the injury.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
