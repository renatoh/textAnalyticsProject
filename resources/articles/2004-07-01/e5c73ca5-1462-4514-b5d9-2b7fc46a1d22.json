Why should it, after producing the most famous pop band in the world? The Beatles Story exhibition, which was formerly a sort of budget version of Madame Tussauds, told the story of the Fab Four in a series of themed rooms, including the Cavern and Magical Mystery land. It has now had a facelift, which includes an audio tour narrated by Julia, John Lennon's sister, and featuring contributions from Paul McCartney, George Martin and Peter Blake, though no Ringo. Macca's comments are fond but unrevealing, although some of the others recount interesting anecdotes. If you are already a devotee, you are unlikely to learn much new here. This is a PG-rated version of the group's myth, while the hard sell is occasionally irritating ('Welcome to the Cavern, the most famous club in the world.' Really; still?) The music, of course, is brilliant and, despite myself, I found John's Lennon's white room at the end strangely moving. Not quite magical but worth a visit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
