While Golden Smog is ostensibly a fun, part-time vehicle, there must be some simmering ego clashes involved, however subconscious. Thus, the best tracks here benefit from an indiscernible undercurrent. You Make It Easy is terrific dark powerpop, a song of longing with a desperate psychotic edge. Beautiful Mind sounds imperceptibly disturbed, an echo-laden melody that sounds like it's literally blowing in the wind. Elsewhere, there are crafted melodies, beautifully plaintive ballads and homage-pastiches of Cheap Trick and Neil Young. However, several of them have the bolted-together-by-bits feel of experts exuding perspiration over inspiration, meaning Golden Smog never entirely equal the sum of their parts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
