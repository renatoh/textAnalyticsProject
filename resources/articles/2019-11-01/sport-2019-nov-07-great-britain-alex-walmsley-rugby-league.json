Having targeted four wins from four against Tonga, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, two consecutive losses so far is certainly not ideal, but for Walmsley, just being on the trip alone is an achievement given what he has been through in his career. Walmsley has taken the unconventional route to the top, going from local playing fields to Great Britain international in just a handful of years, having played amateur rugby until the age of 22. But even after earning his big break with St Helens, Walmsley has had numerous hurdles to overcome to reach this point: including a serious neck injury last year which put his entire career in jeopardy. \u201cNobody had done that injury in professional sport and played again,\u201d Walmsley says in the run-up to Saturday\u2019s meeting with the Kiwis in Christchurch (7am GMT). \u201cThe actual neck injury I\u2019d sustained was three-levelled. I was questioning whether I was right to come back, and it was a question nobody could answer for a long time. There were so many unknowns. I had so many scans and the doctors told me I wasn\u2019t ready to play, and when I went for another last December, I started to think if it wasn\u2019t this time, when was it going to be?\u201d Eventually, after being told repeatedly he would be unable to return to playing, Walmsley got the all-clear. But even then, after an injury that could have easily put his health \u2013 as well as his career \u2013 at risk, there were serious doubts lingering in the forward\u2019s mind: \u201cWas it worth risking it all \u2026 my quality of life, being able to be a normal dad? \u201cDid I want to risk everything to play a game I love? It was something I had to decide, but I felt I wasn\u2019t done. There\u2019s a point when you know you\u2019re done, but I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Being cleared physically was not the end of Walmsley\u2019s battle, either: there were now mental demons to overcome. \u201cI was terrified going into games at first,\u201d he admits. \u201cBefore the first game, I just remember thinking that I want to be sat in the changing rooms in two hours\u2019 time. I actually spoke to a psychologist for a couple of months leading up to playing again \u2013 and even for a few weeks afterwards. \u201cWe\u2019d had a weekly chat for an hour, with 58 minutes chatting about anything and everything; kids, football, life, and only two minutes about my neck, because I didn\u2019t want to embrace it that much. But knowing I got those two minutes each week was comforting. It\u2019s amazing what your mind can do; you can create a mountain out of nothing. That helped. It\u2019s still in the back of my mind and always will be, but ultimately it\u2019s becoming less and less at the forefront.\u201d Walmsley\u2019s story does have a happy ending, though. His form this year for St Helens was outstanding and he was instrumental in their run to the title. But a rollercoaster period in Walmsley\u2019s life isn\u2019t finished yet: now there is the challenge of righting the wrongs from the opening fortnight of the tour. \u201cWe\u2019re sat here with two losses and the group are frustrated, but everyone remains positive,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re desperate to even the score with the Kiwis after last week and we know we\u2019ve got the mettle to get it done. Stick with us. It doesn\u2019t get much better than playing for England \u2026 apart from Great Britain. It\u2019s amazing to follow so many legends and etch my name alongside some of the greats.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
