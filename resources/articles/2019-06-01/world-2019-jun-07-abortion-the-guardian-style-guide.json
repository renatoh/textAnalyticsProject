Editors and reporters are encouraged to use the term \u201csix-week abortion ban\u201d over \u201cfetal heartbeat bill\u201d, unless they are quoting someone. \u201cWe want to avoid medically inaccurate, misleading language when covering women\u2019s reproductive rights,\u201d the Guardian\u2019s US editor-in-chief, John Mulholland, said. \u201cThese are arbitrary bans that don\u2019t reflect fetal development \u2013 and the language around them is often motivated by politics, not science.\u201d The Guardian style guide already encourages editors to use \u201canti-abortion\u201d over \u201cpro-life\u201d for clarity, and \u201cpro-choice\u201d over \u201cpro-abortion\u201d, since not everyone who supports a woman\u2019s right to reproductive choice supports abortion at a personal level. The Guardian\u2019s updated style guide on abortion bans is in line with the view of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the largest professional organization for doctors specializing in women\u2019s health. ACOG, which represents 58,000 physicians, says the term \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d is not medically accurate. \u201cPregnancy and fetal development are a continuum,\u201d said the ACOG president, Dr Ted Anderson. \u201cWhat\u2019s interpreted as a heartbeat in these bills is actually electrically induced flickering of a portion of fetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops.\u201d Some doctors who opposed the bans say the term was developed as political tactic to win support for the bills. \u201cThese bills present the idea that there\u2019s something that looks like what you or a person on the street would call a baby \u2013 a thing that\u2019s almost ready to go for a walk,\u201d said Dr Jen Gunter, a gynecologist in Canada and the US who runs an influential blog. \u201cIn reality, you\u2019re talking about something that\u2019s millimeters in size and doesn\u2019t look anything like that.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s updated style guide comes as a wave of restrictive abortion bans are sweeping the US: between 1 January and 20 May, 378 abortion restrictions were introduced across the United States. An unprecedented 40% of them have been abortion bans that prohibit terminations after a certain gestational age or for another specific reason, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Many of those measures ban abortion after about six weeks, before most women know they are pregnant. Despite the laws, abortion is legal in all 50 US states because the bans contravene Roe v Wade, the landmark decision which legalized abortion in 1973. The laws are all expected to be challenged in court and are unlikely ever to go into effect. Supporters hope the bills will make it to the US supreme court and force a challenge to Roe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
