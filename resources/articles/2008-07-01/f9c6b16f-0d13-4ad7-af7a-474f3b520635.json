As you may expect if you, or your kids, have played any game based on a film licence over the past year, this is a button-bashing affair that demands little skill. Most of the play involves simple combat, with the odd puzzle section thrown in. Don't get too excited, though - these conundrums normally involve simple tasks like pulling the right lever. That's not to say this is a terrible game. Shove a Narnia fan in front of the TV and they will probably enjoy playing out some of the film's action-heavy scenes. The graphics are decent enough, though a little too dark in places. Frustratingly the camera is unhelpful, making some sections harder than they need be, while the cutscenes and narrative are fragmented and confusing. Combine these problems with the uninspiring gameplay and you have a Narnia game for fans only."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
