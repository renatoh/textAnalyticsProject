Forecasters said the conditions would ease into Tuesday and Wednesday, before the wet weather returned later in the week. Monday\u2019s heavy downpour hit most parts of the city around lunch time, forcing some road closures, while cars slowly waded through flooded streets elsewhere. The city\u2019s light rail system went down for a few hours and at least one retail outlet, at Neutral Bay, suffered storm damage. Sydney\u2019s north shore bore the brunt of the wet weather, with 46mm of rain falling in Manly and 37mm in Mosman. On the other side of the harbour, there were also rainfall totals above 25mm around the Bondi and Rose Bay areas. The Sydney Observatory recorded 30mm of rain, while some catchments received 14mm in just 20 minutes. Jordan Notara, a senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, said the deluge was cause by a concentration of showers that had moved from the coastline. \u201c[That] resulted in a period of time where we saw some heavy show activity,\u201d he said. But overall the rainfall was \u201cmoderate, not heavy\u201d, he said. Notara said any showers on Tuesday morning would be confined to coastal areas before clearing off by the afternoon. By Thursday, another coastal trough is expected to deepen, with showers forecast up to the weekend, he added. The rain comes only a few weeks after the NSW government announced Sydney was facing water restrictions for the first time in a decade. Dam levels are at 53.5% across all 11 dams, with Warragamba dam at 54.8% and Woronora dam at 44.3%. While large swathes of New South Wales is in drought, this week\u2019s rain is not expected to fall where it\u2019s most needed. \u201cThe rainfall we\u2019re seeing is definitely coastally driven and that is not where the most impactful drought conditions are occurring,\u201d Notara said. \u201cSo unfortunately all the rain we\u2019re seeing doesn\u2019t move over the Great Dividing Range and into those areas which are needing it most. \u201cIt looks as though in the forecast to come it will continue to see the rainfall mostly confined to the eastern parts of New South Wales.\u201d Currently, top temperatures are expected to hover between 16C-18C for the rest of the week. Sydneysiders shivered through a top of 13.6C on Monday. Rain is also forecast for much of the week in Melbourne, where temperatures are not expected to exceed 14C."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
