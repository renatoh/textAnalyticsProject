Hussain was killed in a targeted US drone attack in late August. He was understood to be plotting attacks on UK soil and attempted to recruit at least one undercover reporter to build a pressure cooker bomb. Jones was also believed to be trying to recruit extremists in the UK to the same task. The 46-year-old former punk musician, a mother of two, has had more than 20 handles on Twitter and used the site to declare her hostility to the west. On 10 September she reappeared to comment on her husband\u2019s death, writing: \u201cMy husband said he wanted me to carry on if he got shaheed [martyred] \u2026 I do not fear the Kuffar [infidels],\u201d adding, \u201cENGLAND hates me \u2013 praise be to god.\u201d Nasser Muthana Cardiff-born Nasser Muthana travelled to Syria in 2013 with his younger brother Aseel. The former medical student was placed on the UK treasury\u2019s sanctions list in July 2014 after appearing in an Isis recruitment video titled There is No Life without Jihad alongside fellow Britons Ruhul Amin and Reyaad Khan. Amin and Khan were both killed in the first acknowledged UK drone strike on British citizens outside of a war zone. Earlier this month, Muthana\u2019s father, Ahmed, a retired electrical engineer, raised fears that both his sons could be on a British \u2018kill list\u2019. Last year he described Nasser, 21, as having \u201cbetrayed Great Britain\u201d. Aqsa Mahmood The Glaswegian was just 19 when she travelled to Syria in Nov 2013, one of the first women to leave for the country. As she crossed the Turkish border, the former private school girl told her parents that she wanted to become a martyr. The UK government believes she is a a key figure in the al-Khanssaa brigade, a female outfit established by Isis in Raqqa to enforce Sharia law. She recently celebrated terror attacks in France and Tunisia by penning a poem and has encouraged further attacks to be carried out over social media. Recently she created a packing list for women wishing to join Isis in its so-called caliphate, which included good lingerie. Abu-Said al-Britani AKA Omar Hussain Hussain, 27, who travelled to Syria to fight for Isis in early 2014, has been an active propagandist for Isis. He initially joined Jabhat al Nusra, al-Qaida\u2019s branch in Syria, but later defected, like many other foreigners in the conflict, to Isis. In August 2014, Al-Britani spoke publicly to the British media saying that he would only return to the UK in order to \u201cplant a bomb\u201d. He has an active blog on Tumblr and earlier this month, in a peculiar 6,000 word screed, described Arabs as \u201cquite peculiar, annoying, and at times somewhat stressful to interact and associate with\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
