Since then its activities have expanded substantially but the challenges remain. Listen to Nathan here (1min13secs) Reader's donations will contribute to MSF's ongoing work. The main focus is providing antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) to people with HIV and Aids. In 2003 MSF began a new programme to provide integrated services for people with HIV and tuberculosis (TB). MSF staff see an average of 15-20 new TB cases every day. But it is not only sheer numbers that pose a challenge, as Nathan Ford explains: Listen to Nathan here (1min4secs) In August 2005 MSF opened the Similela Rape Survivors centre to help victims of rape. In this centre MSF staff provide drugs to prevent HIV infection, counselling and social and legal support. MSF also runs a rural treatment centre in Lusikisiki, described here by Nathan Ford: Listen to Nathan here (1min26secs) The MSF treatment centres are already working over capacity. Yet the number of people on ARVs in Khayelitsha is projected to double to 6,000 in 2006. Whilst handing over as much as possible to the provincial and national health services MSF will continue to scale up its treatment. Drawing from its success in South Africa in January 2006 MSF opened a new treatment centre in Lesotho. Nathan Ford explains some of the reasons behind this decision: Listen to Nathan here (1min13secs) MSF aims to treat around 600 patients in Lesotho by the end of the year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
