Lennon spent last season, his first full one in management, on a six-month rolling deal,, on a salary thought to be worth about \u00a3200,000. The wages of Lennon and his coaches, Alan Thompson, Johan Mjallby and Garry Parker, are understood to have totalled no more than \u00a3400,000. Despite Lennon's failure to reclaim the Scottish Premier League title from Rangers, the Parkhead board recognised a clear improvement in performances after Lennon replaced Tony Mowbray. The manager's new contract was agreed and ratified by the board before he left Scotland for a family holiday a fortnight ago. The 39-year-old will put pen to paper when he returns to work on Monday. Lennon has been given a higher salary \u2013 believed to be more than double last season's terms \u2013 and a 12-month rolling deal; former Celtic managers like Martin O'Neill and Gordon Strachan had similar contracts. Incentive-based bonuses are included in the agreement and Thompson, Mjallby and Parker are likely to have their terms enhanced. Lennon faced a series of high-profile security threats last season, including a touchline attack by an opposition supporter, but said he would not be forced out of a club he served as a player. The former Northern Ireland midfielder is under close security surveillance but has no desire to leave Celtic or Glasgow. There will be tension between Lennon and the new Rangers manager, Ally McCoist, next season \u2013 the two clashed on the Celtic Park touchline following a game on 2 March. Lennon will face a tough task in convincing Beram Kayal to commit his future to Celtic. Celtic want to offer the Israel midfielder improved terms but Kayal is considering his options, in the light of interest from a number of English clubs. Celtic are also keen to give a new contract to Emilio Izaguirre, their Honduran full-back who, like Kayal, has attracted admiring glances from England. Lennon's other main aim before the new season starts is to sign a goalkeeper. Fraser Forster, Celtic's goalkeeper last season, has returned to Newcastle following the completion of a loan spell. Celtic are interested in Shay Given but may be priced out of a move for him, with Manchester City reportedly looking for a meaningful fee for the 35-year-old Republic of Ireland player. The Maccabi Petah Tikva striker Omer Damari, rated at \u00a32.5m, has emerged as a transfer target for Celtic. Both halves of the Old Firm are reportedly interested in Crystal Palace's Neil Danns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
