It is no coincidence that the Cottagers' woeful form - plunging to within five points of the relegation zone and being humiliated by Second Division Wigan in the Worthington Cup - has occurred as the club's injury list has grown and grown. Tigana discovers tomorrow if his worst-case scenario will occur, which would rob him of strike pair Facundo Sava and Barry Hayles, along with centre-back Zat Knight, for weeks. Sava lasted just 45 minutes of last night's embarrassing 2-1 defeat at Wigan before being forced off with a calf problem. The Argentinian, who had also needed five stitches in a head wound, is having a scan today to assess a possible strain. Tigana will know the result tomorrow, the day Hayles - already out for three weeks with a neck vertebrae injury - sees a specialist to find out if he needs an operation. The injuries leave Tigana facing a severe striker shortage ahead of Saturday's Loftus Road crunch with crisis club Leeds. Louis Saha is out until January with a hamstring surgery and fellow frontman Steve Marlet is suspended, leaving no recognised forwards available. Tigana is likely to pair left-midfielder Luis Boa Morte, himself just back from a thigh problem, up front with forgotten man Andrejs Stolcers, the Latvian who has made scarce appearances in two years at Fulham. But that was not the end of the bad news as defender Knight, forced off at half-time at the JJB Stadium with a hamstring injury, will also undergo a scan tomorrow morning to reveal to extent of his injury. The 22-year-old said today that he feels he will be fit to take on United - but Fulham physio Jason Palmer has called for tomorrow's examination."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
