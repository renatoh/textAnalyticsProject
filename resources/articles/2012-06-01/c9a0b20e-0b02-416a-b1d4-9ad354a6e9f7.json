Grayson Perry's The Vanity Of Small Differences \u2013 eight tapestries charting the rise and fall of Tim Rakewell \u2013 replaces Hogarth's London-centric vision with the Little England of Tunbridge Wells, Sunderland and the Cotswolds. New fangled gadgets pile up in his tapestries, made on Photoshop and woven on computerised looms. Smartphones, flash cars and social networking are all coveted trappings as we follow Tim through a land of call centres, car parks and protest camps. Victoria Miro, N1, Thu to 11 Aug Skye Sherwin Paul Morrison, Sheffield Paul Morrison creates illustrations, often on a huge scale, for stories that have been forgotten or not even written. His graphic style is sometimes packed with filigree elaboration. At other times it's reminiscent of the boldest German expressionistic woodcuts or Japanese manga. The factual precision of botanical illustration is seamlessly mixed with the fantasies of fairytales. Princesses wander amid pine forests and flora. There is more than a hint of the bad acid trip about it all: a spider in the grass, or a twinge of paranoia, a spook in the undergrowth. Above all, though, it's good to see the Millennium Gallery honouring one of the city's most internationally recognised artists. Millennium Gallery, Thu to 4 Nov Robert Clark Stephen Willats, London Stephen Willats's approach to art is the opposite of the usual museum model. Instead of playing the remote creator, making work for an unknown public, this pioneer of participatory art collaborates with communities. This show restages Changing Everything, his 1998 work exploring generational differences among Peckham residents, alongside Surfing With The Attractor, a new work made with 14 artists. Armed with cameras and recording equipment, they've documented street life in the commercial centre of Regent Street and the less glitzy Rye Lane. The results are both a testament to interconnectivity and the impossibility of reflecting an individual's understanding of the chaotic nature of the world. South London Gallery, SE5, to 15 Jul SS The Art Of Motion, West Bromwich The Art Of Motion is bound to prove popular, as would any show that gets you jumping. Some miseries might argue this means it cannot be serious art, but any art that is fun has to be at least partly good. Here is a Will Nash table tennis set up where visitors can play and in so doing electronically compose a live sound sculpture. Then there's Cyclomation 2 by Steve Chamberlain, where you can direct your own movie purely through pedal power. Most dramatic of all is James Alliban's Traces, which converts the most self-conscious of visitors' gestures into an amazement of spaced-out light ribbons and flashing particles. A playground for adults, sure, but maybe that's a good role for a contemporary art gallery to embrace. The Public, to 9 Sep RC Joel Holmberg &amp; Jon Rafman, Norwich The Canadian artist Jon Rafman is best known for finding the Google Street View images that break the rules. Shots in that earlier work included a nudist and a house on fire. His latest images feature surreal classical-style busts printed with type, floral patterns and the UPS logo. These eerie, digitally altered creations are paired here with work by Joel Holmberg, a New Yorker with a similar talent for bucking internet norms, including posting gnomic conundrums such as \"how do you occupy space?\" on Yahoo Answers. Holmberg's installation features giant Post-it notes, Ikea office storage filled with flowers, and a gallery assistant who announces, \"You are the most recent visitor\" like a website counter. It all adds up to a disorienting mix of the real and the virtual. Outpost, to 21 Jun SS Tabitha Moses, Liverpool Fine calico and satin, stuffed with sawdust to look like a hacked-off limb, is embroidered with beads and entomology pins. The piece is called I'm Fine, I'm Happy, Everything's Okay, Nothing's Wrong. The title protests too cheerily of course and the overall effect is of painful recoil. The Victoria Gallery &amp; Museum also houses the University of Liverpool's medical collections, so it's a perfect setting for Tabitha Moses's nightmare arts-and-craft sculptures. Moses references the effect of psychological hysteria on the female body in the form of skin eruptions and twisted limbs, making her work undeniably beautiful and so all the more disturbing. Victoria Gallery &amp; Museum, to 24 Nov RC Elizabeth Peyton &amp; Jonathan Horowitz, London Elizabeth Peyton favours waifish good looks in her paintings, which have featured the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio. But in this show she substitutes the bloom of youth for actual blooms. Made in collaboration with Jonathan Horowitz, these paintings and other works take houseplants, Freud and a secret Victorian sex diary for inspiration. Peyton's paintings draw on the ephemeral beauty and erotic symbolism of plants. Horowitz's works meanwhile use a pared-down grey palette and houseplants to suggest the feelings that home life evokes. Sadie Coles, W1, Thu to 25 Aug SS Vlassis Caniaris, Leeds A pair of tights, stained bright yellow and packed out with chicken wire and red plastic carnations perches upright atop an old wooden stool like some kitsch version of a fragmented classical statue. The feet are fitted out with kids' sandals, one of which steps forward on to a scrap of MDF. The right thigh is bound around, for some reason, with a white rag. The piece as a whole throws a rather misshapen and creepy shadow on the back gallery wall. That's all there is to this work, but it's more than enough. The Greek artist Vlassis Caniaris, who died last year, could stick any found bits of worthless junk together in an otherwise empty room and manage to infuse and fill it with charm and pathos. Composition 1974, which is what the piece is titled with almost self-effacing modesty, simply stands there all lonely, forlorn; terribly vulnerable and really quite lovable.
