The former England manager, who left his position with the national team after only one match following an undercover newspaper investigation, is now pointing the finger at fixture congestion. Yohan Cabaye, Christian Benteke and Andros Townsend were all substituted by Allardyce with Palace losing 2-0 at Arsenal on Sunday afternoon as the manager began to turn his attention to Tuesday\u2019s home game with the bottom side Swansea City. \u201cWe\u2019ve been dealt the blow of not having enough recovery time between now and Tuesday night, why can\u2019t we play Wednesday?\u201d asked Allardyce. \u201cI don\u2019t know who does the fixtures but he needs sacking really. \u201cSwansea played yesterday, have 24 hours on us. They\u2019re such big games with so much at stake, you want a fair crack at it, and it\u2019s unfair when you\u2019re playing [Sunday] and Tuesday night. I was disappointed in our first-half performance [against Arsenal]. \u201cWe gave much too good possession away. None more so than the [Giroud] goal. That was simple possession given away on one of our attacks in the first half. It was a brilliant piece of skill, how he took the goal, but our passing wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d Allardyce is now looking to the transfer window to help out his Palace squad. \u201cTwo things [need] to happen for the team to get better and produce more results: get the team fitter and buy players in. Two if possible, three if the finances will allow,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to lift the squad. It lifted the whole place last year at Sunderland.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
