He added: \u201cBut I do think the best thing that we can do is to live our normal lives, not change too much, because then the terrorists are the ones that are winning. We need to go out there and do what we always do. \u201cThat\u2019s all we can do. I don\u2019t want to live my life in fear each time I step on a tennis court. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d Great Britain\u2019s captain, Leon Smith, announces his team on Tuesday for the final against Belgium in the 14,000-seater Flanders Expo in Ghent, starting on 28 November, only five days after the final here. French and Belgian security forces have trained most of their inquiries on the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek, about 35 miles from the Davis Cup venue. Murray described the events in Paris as \u201csomething very difficult to talk about without knowing all of the information\u201d, but added: \u201cAll of sport [has recognised] that it\u2019s a terrible tragedy. Everyone was very upset by it. Hopefully everyone can come together and try and sort it out.\u201d Great Britain\u2019s squad go to Ghent attempting to win the competition for the first time since 1936 \u2013 and two contenders for the second singles spot, Kyle Edmund and Dan Evans, did their chances no harm at the weekend. Edmund beat the world No127 Carlos Berlocq 6-0, 6-4 in the final of a Challenger on clay in Buenos Aires on Sunday \u2013 with Smith watching \u2013 and moved up 11 places to 99 in the world. Evans, ranked 185, beat the rising American teenager Frances Tiafoe 5-7, 6-1, 6-3 to win a Challenger in Knoxville on the same day. \u201cThey both did great,\u201d Murray said. \u201cJames [Ward] won a couple of weeks ago in India, as well. It\u2019s a good position to be in. It\u2019s kind of the same position as the Belgians. They have three guys that are capable of playing the second singles, as well, with Steve Darcis and Kimmer Coppejans probably being the better clay-court players, but Ruben Bemelmans has a slightly different game style. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not just Leon that has some decisions to make but it\u2019s better to have players that are coming in on form, which wasn\u2019t the case really in the last tie. I think that\u2019s what made things tough for Leon [before the semi-final win over Australia in Glasgow].\u201d Aljaz Bedene will learn just before the team are announced if the ITF has granted his appeal to become eligible for his adopted country, despite having already played in the Davis Cup for Slovenia. Murray, who practised on shale at Queen\u2019s last week with Bedene, supports his bid and hinted strongly for the first time he would like him in the team. \u201cIf this decision was made, like, seven months ago, we wouldn\u2019t even be having the discussion. It isn\u2019t his fault that it\u2019s taken such a long time \u2013 or that it\u2019s 10 days before the Davis Cup final. If he wins his appeal and is able to play then, if I\u2019m the captain, I\u2019m picking my strongest team to try and win. But that\u2019s Leon\u2019s decision. That\u2019s what he\u2019s paid to do. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll make the right one and give us the best chance to win. But, I mean, Bedene may not win his appeal.\u201d As for Murray\u2019s outing on the hard court of the O2 \u2013 a surface slower than might have been expected \u2013 he was pleased, but with qualifications. \u201cThe first couple of games my timing was a little bit off. But I got it back pretty quickly, which was pleasing. He\u2019s also a guy who makes you hit a lot of balls. The rallies are often quite long, so you can get into a rhythm against him. So that was good. \u201cHe served a bunch of double-faults, which helped but I could have returned a bit better. The ball\u2019s coming through a little bit quicker and slightly lower than on the clay. That was the one thing I think I could have done better.\u201d Ferrer, whose own game fell to bits under pressure, especially his serve, reckoned Murray would handle the transition without any major concerns. \u201cHe\u2019s playing good,\u201d said the Spaniard, whose press conferences often tend to be about his opponent rather than himself, so self-effacing is he. \u201cHe reached the Paris final last week. He is No2 of the world. He\u2019s playing with confidence. Also he\u2019s in the final of the Davis Cup where he will be playing the three matches. He has a very good chance to win his first Davis Cup. He\u2019s having one of the best seasons of his career, for sure.\u201d In the evening match, the French Open champion Stan Wawrinka capitulated in desultory fashion as Rafael Nadal opened his account with a convincing 6-3, 6-2 win in just 93 minutes, echoing the low-key start to last year\u2019s tournament when the world\u2019s best players seemed incapable of extending any match to three sets."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
