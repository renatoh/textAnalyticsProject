As Owen completed his seventh day of silence yesterday, speculation increased that he hopes to exploit a \u00a39m escape clause in his Newcastle contract in order to rejoin Liverpool or, perhaps, sign for Manchester United. Tellingly Owen, unlike the majority of the Newcastle squad, was not around to meet Allardyce when the club's new manager was introduced to his players on Tuesday. Although the squad are officially on holiday - Owen was in Ireland - those who had not already flown off on vacation were generally keen to meet Allardyce, who yesterday displayed his ruthless side by releasing five of them. Titus Bramble, the 25-year-old centre half acquired from Ipswich by Sir Bobby Robson, was the highest-profile casualty. Told his contract would not be renewed, Bramble is now believed to be attracting interest from Fulham and Portsmouth. Coincidentally, Sol Campbell, the Portsmouth defender whose girlfriend lives on Tyneside, has made it clear he is extremely keen on joining Newcastle this summer.The others discarded along with Bramble were Craig Moore, Oguchi Onyewu, who has been on loan from Standard Liege, Pavel Srnicek and Olivier Bernard. Allardyce yesterday insisted he requires a minimum of \"four or five\" recruits before August and plans to hold talks with Steve Sidwell, the Reading midfielder who had seemingly reached an informal agreement with Roeder to join Newcastle, in the next couple of days. However, Sidwell now appears destined for Chelsea. \"I certainly think we need four or five new players,\" said Allardyce, who has been linked with Jlloyd Samuel, the Aston Villa left-back. \"Then it depends on me talking to the other lads who are already here, one on one, and seeing whether they want to stay or go. Allardyce is determined to hire team players rather than the sort of random \"big names\" traditionally captured by Newcastle. \"It's very important we recruit the best players possible and make sure we're not looking at big names all the time as Newcastle have done in the past.\" In the interim he offered a thinly veiled warning to Newcastle's current personnel, insisting: \"If I have to be ruthless, I will. I'm very good at working people out.\" Robert Huth, the Middlesbrough centre- half, has undergone ankle surgery and will almost certainly miss the early part of next season. However, Boro yesterday received better news from Jonathan Woodgate, another central defender, whose recent knee operation has been deemed a \"major success\" and who expects to be fit for the first game of the new campaign. Blackburn's striker Benni McCarthy is hoping Chelsea's manager Jose Mourinho will give him another crack at the Champions League. \"If something extraordinary does come and it's a big team, a Champions League team, then I would love to ask for the opportunity to try my fortunes at a higher level, at the biggest stage,\" the former Porto striker said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
