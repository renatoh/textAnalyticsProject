A self-saucing scallop. Offal arranged like it\u2019s in an art gallery. Chef Josh Niland\u2019s skills with seafood are the stuff of legend, and the 30-year-old owner of the award-winning restaurant Saint Peter and the sustainable Fish Butchery is now famous for his mission to turn the tragically wasteful seafood industry into something more sustainable. Forging his own path in a saturated industry, Niland has reintroduced the world to the concept of fin-to-fin cooking, and is single-handedly changing the way we think about eating fish. Here\u2019s his guide to set you on the path to eating seafood more sustainably. Where to shop sustainably At Fish Butchery, under-utilised species of Australian fish that have been sustainably caught are pre-prepared and displayed beautifully in glass cabinets, ready for you to take home. You can be sure that every cut you\u2019re getting from this new-age fishmonger is of supreme quality. Can\u2019t make it? Niland recommends taking the time to find a local, Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)-certified fishmonger that stocks a diversity of species. When a product is stamped with the MSC blue label, it means the fish has been well managed and sustainably caught. Opening the conversation \u2013 and staying loyal Get to know the staff at your local fish shop and learn more about where your food is coming from. Fostering good relationships with your suppliers is one of the easiest steps you can take to eating more sustainably. Niland says a good fishmonger will engage, and be happy to help you get the best produce. Ask where the day\u2019s catch came from. Was it caught on the line, or did it come from a small-scale operation? Then, if you find a place you\u2019re happy with, stay loyal. \u201cFish shops are somewhat of a dying breed,\u201d Niland says. \u201cLabour and food costs are uncomfortably high and supply is challenging. If you find a good one, stick with them.\u201d Red flags at the fish shop Niland\u2019s top tip is to purchase fish with your senses. Often, the damaged and dull fish are the ones that have been poorly handled at point-of-capture or in transit. He also says to avoid piles of fish slumped over ice and anything lying under a running tap (water speeds up the deterioration of the fish, giving it a shelf life of just a few days). Eat with the seasons You wouldn\u2019t buy a peach in June, so don\u2019t shop for Atlantic salmon in January. Just like fruit, fish are seasonal; different species are readily available and of better quality at certain times of the year, depending on factors such as water temperature, food supply and geographic location. To eat with the seasons, shop at fishmongers rather than big supermarkets (where things are available year-round), and chat to suppliers about what they recommend. Niland has a few seasonal favourites. In spring, he likes King George whiting, while in summer, a number of flathead species will be readily available. Tailor and teraglin are two winners for autumn, while in winter the mirror dory (a brother of the readily available John Dory) is the one to watch. Celebrate more species Australia has a plethora of under-utilised fish. To leave them, and instead overfish the species we\u2019re familiar with, seems a crime, especially when eating new species opens up new flavours and ideas. Fish we\u2019re ignoring, that are in abundance in Australia, include the Australian salmon, blue mackerel, yellow-eye mullet and a number of different flathead species. Find them at Fish Butchery, or hunt them down at your local fish shop. Get comfortable with offal Niland is desperate to bring desirability back to the \u201csecondaries\u201d of the fish that are habitually discarded during production (parts such as the head, liver, roe and fins). Over time, the Western world has normalised using only 40-50% of the fish. The rest tragically goes to waste. The textures, aromas and appearances of offal can be disconcerting, sure, but they shouldn\u2019t be. For centuries, people around the world have been eating and celebrating the whole fish without a hitch. One of the easiest ways to consume fish sustainably? Eat more of it. Start small, with liver and roe (there are recipes in Niland\u2019s groundbreaking new book, The Whole Fish Cookbook), or order offal when you\u2019re eating out in restaurants to help change consumer behaviour and let the hospitality industry know you want more. Take small steps, and work your way up Don\u2019t dive head-first into offal if you\u2019re not ready. Instead, make small changes, such as experimenting with new techniques in the kitchen to increase your confidence cooking with fish. Niland says grilling a whole fish, such as a greenback flounder, is just as easy as pan-frying a fillet of salmon, but it\u2019s a new skill that will get you comfortable using more of the animal. This recipe, with straightforward instructions and simple ingredients, is one of many in The Whole Fish Cookbook. Under Niland\u2019s direction, you\u2019ll be plating up fish eyes in no time.
