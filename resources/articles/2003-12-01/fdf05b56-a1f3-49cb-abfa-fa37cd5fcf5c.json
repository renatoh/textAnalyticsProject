For instance, whisky lovers might regard you as a tight git who's done a supermarket sweep at Calais if you turn up with a bottle of Bell's, but give them a bottle of BNJ (Bailie Nicol Jarvie, \u00a313.49, Sainsbury's) and they'll view you as a person of discrimination and taste. Absolut is unimaginative (unless it's the new Vanilia flavour). Buy vodka fans Ketel One, which has just gone into Waitrose at \u00a316.99, or a wackily retro bottle of Russian Sputnik vodka instead (\u00a39.99, Unwins). Dark rum is really Christmassy, but it should be Myers's (around \u00a313.49 a bottle), not Lamb's Navy. And daiquiri and mojito fans will thank you for a bottle of Havana Club (on offer at \u00a39.99 at Safeway), rather than boring old Bacardi. Gin should be Plymouth rather than Gordon's; even better, get a bottle of Plymouth's sloe gin liqueur (\u00a39.99, Asda and Safeway) or damson liqueur (\u00a39.99, Waitrose and Oddbins). Pour a third of a glass and top up with fizz for an instant Christmas cocktail. Liqueurs are generally a safe bet. My current favourite is the delectably orangey Grand Marnier, which you'll find all over for around \u00a319.49 and in a limited-edition bottle in Harvey Nichols and Selfridges. Famous Grouse has also produced a new, very spicy liqueur that will appeal to ginger lovers, available exclusively at Tesco for \u00a318.99. Add a dash to a classic champagne cocktail; ginger tastes surprisingly good with fizz. Finally, and I never thought I'd find myself saying this, lay in a supply of M&amp;S Shaken &amp; Stirred pre-mix cocktails (\u00a36.99). Avoid White Russian, which tastes like an alcoholic latte, but Sea Breeze and Pina Colada are really quite sneakily enjoyable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
