The Alabama Media Group, which operates the Birmingham News, the Huntsville Times and the Mobile Press-Register, filled their Sunday papers with 200 essays from Alabama women of various backgrounds, ages and political leanings. The essays were also available as a package online under the title \u201cIt\u2019s time to hear Alabama\u2019s women\u201d. Though the state was \u201cthe talk of the nation last week\u201d, wrote Alabama Media Group\u2019s vice-president, Kelly Ann Scott, in an introduction to the series, \u201cmissing from many of those conversations were the voices of women from this state\u201d. Scott continued that in less than 24 hours, more than 200 Alabama women wrote in with their perspectives. \u201cThey are women who live here, and some who have left,\u201d she said. \u201cThose who have prayed for this very law, and those who now live in fear. Mothers, trying to understand the message this law sends to their daughters and sons. And women who are angry that a majority of men in the state legislature spoke for them.\u201d All 25 Alabama senate votes in favor of the ban, which criminalizes almost all abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest, came from white men (the four women of the state senate voted against). Alabama\u2019s female governor, Kay Ivey, signed the bill into law Wednesday night. Several groups, including the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, have promised to sue, probably tying up the law in court for months. The essays illustrate a range of feeling and frustration over the law\u2019s passage. Some women expressed anger at what they called the hypocrisy of the legislature\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d position. \u201cIf they really believed every life was precious, they wouldn\u2019t have allowed Alabamians to die at an alarming rate from accidents, childbirth and preventable medical conditions,\u201d wrote Tabitha Isner, who is running for chair of the Alabama Democratic party. \u201cThis abortion ban puts myself, my friends and future generations in danger. Not to mention any victims of sexual assault or rape,\u201d said Isabel Hope, a teenager in Tuscaloosa. \u201cI don\u2019t feel safe walking alone ever. How am I supposed to feel knowing that if something were to happen, I would have no options?\u201d Others grappled with their personal beliefs and the implications of the ban, which will disproportionately impact low-income and black women. \u201cI am pro-life, yet I still find it problematic to legally force my personal views upon others, particularly when I know economic disenfranchisement and systemic racism await too many black children once they are born,\u201d wrote Idrissa Snider. \u201cThese issues plague the quality of life for black children every day in our state. One woman, Rachel Hauser, wrote that the ban\u2019s passage compelled her to share the story of her sexual assault for the first time. \u201cIf I had become pregnant from that incident, I would have had an abortion,\u201d she said, noting that she was \u201cthankful\u201d to have the option of emergency contraception at the time. In her introduction, Scott said the Alabama Media Group was restricting online comments on the essays to keep their voices \u201cheard instead of debated\u201d. \u201cNo one should ignore their voices,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
