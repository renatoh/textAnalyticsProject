The show, which will mark the 42nd anniversary of the band and is likely to be screened in the autumn, aims to repeat the success of the Dylan two-parter, No Direction Home, which was directed by Martin Scorsese. The Who programme will be overseen by the Arena editor, Anthony Wall, but has yet to be assigned a director. A BBC spokeswoman said it was \"unlikely\" that Mr Scorsese would oversee the new project but a source insisted the corporation was hoping to attract a \"prominent director\". The BBC is planning to co-produce The Who programme with foreign backers. No Direction Home, which attracted 1.8 million viewers when it was shown on BBC2 late last year, was made with a number of co-producers, including Spitfire Pictures and Thirteen/WNET New York. It also aired on the US public service channel, PBS. The Who show is understood to have the full backing of the band members, who will give the programme makers exclusive interviews as well as backstage access to their 2006 world tour. The two surviving members of the original Who line-up, the singer, Roger Daltrey, and the lead guitarist, Pete Townshend, plan to embark on a tour of the US, Europe, Japan, Australia and South America this summer. Townshend and Daltrey will be accompanied on tour by bassist Pino Palladino, keyboardist John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick, drummer Zak Starkey and the guitarist and brother of Pete, Simon Townshend. Palladino replaces legendary bassist John Entwistle, who died in 2002 of a heart attack in a Las Vegas hotel. Keith Moon, the band's original drummer, died in a similarly rock-and-roll fashion in 1978, when he overdosed on medication designed to wean him off alcohol. He was 32. Townshend, 60, was reportedly reluctant to embark on yet another Who tour but confessed to changing his mind on his weblog just before Christmas. \"After 45 years of this crap, I've just started to enjoy it,\" he wrote. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
