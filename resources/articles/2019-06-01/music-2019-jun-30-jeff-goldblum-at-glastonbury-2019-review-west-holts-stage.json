He fields audience questions on his extremely loud outfit \u2013 yes, those are zebra-patterned trousers \u2013 and flirts outrageously with Kate, a TV runner who comes on to ask him a question about the set and ends up getting roped into singing La Marseillaise with him. His mic gets cut off amid the stage preparations, so the crowd respond with chants of the Jurassic Park theme. Flags featuring Goldblum iconically reclining in The Fly and \u201cLife finds a way\u201d quotes float in front of him. The set itself also turns out to be as much about affable banter as jazz, \u201ca new form of music that\u2019s driving all the kids crazy\u201d, according to Goldblum. Between songs, there is a quiz where the audience have to call out famous film quotes (Titanic splits the crowd between \u201cpaint me like one of your French girls\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m the king of the world\u201d and, er, \u201cICEBERG!\u201d), and a bit where Goldblum canvasses the crowd on where they\u2019re from. \u201cSunderland?\u201d A single man yells affirmation. \u201cAny Geordies?\u201d \u201cFuck off!\u201d the Sunderland man shouts back. Goldblum trades in all this back and forth with supremely, even mythically winning charisma, and his twinkly charm is parlayed into swing numbers with his band, the Mildred Snitzer Orchestra. There are smooth runs through numbers by Sarah Vaughan, Herbie Hancock and Charles Mingus. Vocalist Annie Ellicott blends coquettishness with cool on renditions of Sonny &amp; Cher\u2019s The Beat Goes On and Nat King Cole\u2019s Straighten Up and Fly Right; the LA lounge lizard-y vibes are ramped up by organist Joe Bagg, and Alex Frank is a fantastically dextrous double bassist. Special guest Sharon Van Etten gives Irving Berlin\u2019s Let\u2019s Face the Music and Dance a wondrous, sexy, almost gothic intensity. Goldblum himself plays the piano like a man driving an unfamiliar hire car away from an airport, peering at his sheet music and poking experimentally at chords. But he is game enough to admit his own frailties. \u201cI\u2019m known for the glissando,\u201d he says wryly; he relies on cascading note runs, one-note solos and vamping chords rather than virtuosity. But his magnetism is its own instrument. As his band close out with the Jurassic Park theme, the crowd at the West Holts stage has swelled massively, everyone basking in a beam of starlight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
