The Californian duo\u2019s psych tendencies have blossomed here into wild glam Bowie pastiches, camp vaudeville turns and big band brass freakouts (apparently, all eight songs feature a 40-plus-piece orchestra). At first the wackiness is too much to digest, a sort of \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be mad to review this, but it helps!\u201d Yet against the odds, Hang does reward patience \u2013 there\u2019s a Todd Rundgren-esque devotion to melody throughout and, on the country-tinged On Lankershim, something approaching a conventional tune (until the funny voices arrive). It won\u2019t be for everyone; I still can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s even for me. And as for the band? Even they admit they ended up delving into \u201clyrical scenarios we don\u2019t quite understand\u201d \u2013 which just about sums it up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
