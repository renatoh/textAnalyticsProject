West rushed the stage as Beck was accepting the album of the year award for Morning Phase and looked as though he might take the microphone from him, but then walked away without saying anything. He later said that Beck winning the award over Beyonc\u00e9 was \u201cdisrespectful to inspiration\u201d. Speaking to Ryan Seacrest, West said he wanted to \u201cjust joke around with what happened before\u201d, referring to when he interrupted Swift\u2019s 2009 Video Music Award speech. \u201cSo, the voices in my head told me go, and then I just walked up, like, halfway up the stage ... But I just didn\u2019t really want to take away from Beck\u2019s moment, or the time he\u2019s having to talk,\u201d West said. He went on the criticise the awards ceremony, saying: \u201cIt was kind of a joke \u2013 like the Grammys themselves\u201d. West hadn\u2019t attended the ceremony for the preceding six years, citing his objections to the voting process in explanation. West has a history of interrupting awards speeches. He walked onstage in 2009 as Swift accepted a Video Music Award for video of the year. When he took the microphone from Swift he said that Beyonc\u00e9 had one of the best music videos \u201cof all time\u201d before handing the mic back to a shocked Swift. But West also told Seacrest that Swift supported his decision to go onstage at the Grammys and later suggested they collaborate. \u201cTaylor Swift came up to me right afterwards, literally right afterwards, and tells me that I should have went onstage,\u201d said West. \u201cSo, this is the irony of my life.\u201d West\u2019s interview with Seacrest has also sparked rumors the two are collaborating, with the hip-hop star admitting he was interested in recording with Swift, or any artist who has \u201can amazing perspective\u201d. \u201cShe wants to get in the studio \u2013 we definitely going to go in,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m down to get in the studio and work. I don\u2019t discriminate, I don\u2019t have an elitism of music, because of how many Grammys or the amount of ratings you get on an album.\u201d Beck said that he also believed Beyonc\u00e9 would win album of the year. \u201cI was just so excited he was coming up,\u201d Beck told US Weekly about West after the Grammys. \u201cHe deserves to be onstage as much as anybody. How many great records has he put out in the last five years, right?\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t please everybody, man,\u201d Beck said. \u201cI still love him and think he\u2019s genius. I aspire to do what he does.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
