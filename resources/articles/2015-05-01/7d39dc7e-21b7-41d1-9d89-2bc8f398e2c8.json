They shouldn\u2019t mean all that much to anyone except her school, but they\u2019ve managed to become ridiculously high-stakes. She\u2019s been worrying for a long time and has been on a knife-edge all week. What, I wonder in some of the darker moments, will it be like when she\u2019s 16? Stress is good for us. Students would never bother revising if they didn\u2019t feel a certain amount of pressure. But what happens if you put something or someone under too much stress for too long? In the case of a steel bar, it breaks. In the case of people, they break down. There comes a point at which the pressure applied becomes too great and performance drops off. This is the \u201cinverted-U\u201d hypothesis. The trick then is to get children\u2019s stress levels just right. Ignoring stress is the worst thing students can do. Fear can be crippling and leads people to bottle up the mounting pressures inside. It\u2019s important to learn to recognise where you feel stress \u2013 for me, it\u2019s smack in the middle of my chest. I\u2019ve learned to recognise that when my chest feels tight, I\u2019m stressed. And that\u2019s been a big help. As a teacher, my best advice is always: put the work in. If you\u2019ve done your best, it\u2019s easier to let go of the results. Psychologists have worked out that the most effective exam preparation is to test yourself on a topic, wait until you start forgetting it and then retest yourself. With less than a month to go before most GCSEs, the best gap to leave between self-tests is about three days. Finally, remember this will all be over in a matter of weeks. Hold your nerve.
