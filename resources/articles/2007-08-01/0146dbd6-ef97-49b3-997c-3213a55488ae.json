In the past six Tests the head coach has used five different No15s. Mark Cueto, this weekend's incumbent, has played fewer than 20 games of any description there in his life. Timing, though, is one of Cueto's strengths, as he is showing again this summer. Various other recent cast members - Iain Balshaw, Olly Morgan, Josh Lewsey and Mike Brown the latest, and Jason Robinson, Mark van Gisbergen and Tom Voyce - have either been discarded or deployed elsewhere and the two newest pretenders, Danny Cipriani and Nick Abendanon, are relatively untested. Cueto endured a horribly injury-prone winter but, suddenly, the World Cup gig will be his barring a shocker against Wales at Twickenham. The only risk in shifting the 27-year-old Sale man across the back three is that it could muzzle England's most prolific marksmen. In 18 Test appearances on the wing he has scored 13 tries and even he admits his revised role could compromise that impressive strike rate: \"It's something me and Jason have joked about. Over the years at Sale a lot of our moves have been built around him distracting attention away from the likes of me. That's why I scored so many tries. Now the tables have been turned and I'm the decoy for him.\" Between them, though, Sale's director of rugby, Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9, and Ashton, two shrewd judges of backline talent, are convinced the Cumbria-born Cueto can prove just as valuable a long-term asset at No15 as he has been wide out since scoring two tries on his debut against Canada in the autumn of 2004. Sale's enthusiasm was partly driven by the need to find a replacement for Robinson, who is retiring after the World Cup, but expediency was not the only factor. \"I've spoken quite a lot to Philippe about it and it was a position he saw me potentially maturing into,\" Cueto said. \"I also saw it as a way to broaden my horizons and Brian mentioned it to me in the same week I was talking to Philippe.\" It is possible to argue that Cueto, picked in the starting XV for the final Test of the 2005 Lions series in New Zealand, was a wing by accident anyway. He did not take up rugby seriously until he was 17, having moved to Crewe where football was the dominant force. A Welsh schoolteacher recommended him to various clubs, Sale gave him a trial and he played where he was told. \"Wing was just the place I was given my first opportunity. Things went well and I stayed there.\" Now, though, full-back is his preference. \"I enjoy the freedom of it. On the wing you do go looking for work but there are times when you get into trouble if you're not in a certain position. At full-back you can see everything happening in front of you and can almost be thinking one step ahead. You can pick and choose where you come into the line and a lot more ball is kicked to you. As a wing you often find yourself in the full-back position anyway. I've more experience at full-back than people think. I'm confident of what I can do there.\" In theory, then, everyone is content. Cueto has already had one Test outing at No 15 against Wales in Cardiff last March, when he survived unscathed despite England losing 27-18. \"From a personal point of view I was totally happy. I had to make a couple of last-up tackles, I caught one high ball and another bobbled out. Apart from that I thought the game went well for our back three.\" He has also been on record in recent days as insisting England should aim for a settled line-up as far as possible in their World Cup warm-up games. Because he is not yet the chairman of selectors his views were not rapturously received by everyone within the camp - \"I got a lot of stick for that\" - but you can see why he said it. Assorted ankle, groin, calf and back problems have forced him to miss six of England's last seven Tests; he even had to put his Porsche 911 up for sale because the low seat position was exacerbating his back problems and he switched to driving a Mini. As a result he badly wants a run of consecutive games. \"Do I see myself as England's No1 full-back? I wouldn't say that yet, no.\" A cool, calm display this weekend and that modest analysis may have to be updated. Full-backs since 2003 Josh Lewsey A World Cup winner at No15 in 2003, has had 12 starts since but is now seen as a wing Iain Balshaw Played 10 times at the back since World Cup. Not in current squad Jason Robinson Scored from the wing in 2003 final. Eight starts at No15 since Olly Morgan Given two starts before injury. Cut from squad Tom Voyce Wasps wing started twice in 2006 Mark Cueto One start at full-back last season. Now the No1 choice Mike Brown Two goes in South Africa in June.
