Where it passes between the villages of North and South Cadbury, at Chapel Cross, it goes into a shallow cutting which insulates it from the surrounding farmland. So when we stood on a small patch of ground there, beside the ancient chapel and no more than a few yards from the crowded dual carriageway, with two sleeping pygmy goats, a crested cockerel and two hens for company, we were as unaware of the hordes racing past as they were of us or of the chapel, and seemingly translated into a different sphere of existence from theirs. I had sometimes wondered about the apparently derelict chapel, but had never explored it or made inquiries until a reference to Chapel Cross Tearoom brought us to this spot and introduced us to its history. It is thought to date from the 12th or 13th century, and to have been built to serve pilgrims on their way to Glastonbury. The local stone and thatched roof patched with moss give it a homely look,, despite the lancet windows, and you can easily see the join where a cottage was built on later to the chapel itself, presumably to accommodate a resident priest. It took just 10 of my paces from end to end of the chapel, and another seven to the end of the cottage. Inside, we admired the barrel-vaulted ceiling, and the beautiful modern joinery of gallery, staircase and furnishings, while the owner, Rose Adams, told us how her mother had bought the building in 1966 for \u00a3500. It had previously served for many years as labourers' cottages. Since then, through all the complications of planning regulations and with the expert help of her husband and friends, she has revived the old chapel and made it a place of rest, refreshment and friendship \u2013 a proper change of use, she feels (and we agreed over tea and scones) for what was once a chapel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
