The formula's getting pretty tired by now, but you don't watch for originality. This season's hopefuls are a bunch of good old-fashioned hysterics - one's called Lluvy, which says it all, Michelle's paranoid, and Rebecca faints when the judges give her some \"constructive criticism\". Clare Birchall Films Mermaids (Richard Benjamin, 1990) 8.20pm, FilmFour Winona Ryder stars as young Charlotte, who is coming of age in 1963: Kennedy's assassination sets the tone for lost innocence and illusions as she falls for handsome Joe (Michael Schoeffling). But aside from her own rampant hormones she also has to come to terms with the outrageous behaviour of her sexy mum (Cher), who is involved with shopkeeper Bob Hoskins: two splashing leads in Benjamin's bright and eccentric comedy. Abouna (Mahamet-Saleh Haroun, 2002) 10.30pm, BBC4 The French-educated Haroun's second feature is set in his native Chad and follows the fortunes of two boys after their father has gone missing (the title translates as Our Father). Teenaged Tahir (Ahidjo Mahamat Moussa) and little Amine (Hamza Moctar Aguid) go searching for their father, and think they find him - appearing in a film at their local cinema; they get into trouble and their long-suffering mother sends them to a strict Koranic school, at which point the tone grows darker. But this is a gentle, wise film about love and loss, enriched by the lovely performances of the boys. Frida (Julie Taymor, 2002) 1.50am, Sky Movies 1 A vivid biography of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, who overcame constant pain following a road accident to produce powerful paintings (now on show in London), matched by her passionate lovelife: Taymor's colourful movie is more interested in the latter than the former, but co-producer Salma Hayek takes her lead role very seriously, and the likes of Alfred Molina as her philandering, Marxist husband Diego Rivera and Geoffrey Rush in a small role as Leon Trotsky help flesh out the heated political background. Roger Dodger (Dylan Kidd, 2002) 3.25am, Sky Movies 2 Kidd's fascinating black comedy is part character study of the monstrously cynical advertising copywriter-cum-lothario of the title, and part a tale of the triumph of innocence over misanthropic experience. It's a compelling mix. Campbell Scott's Roger is an exercise in going-to-seed, sardonic chat-up patter; but his lone-wolf habits are disturbed when fresh-faced nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) arrives in town wanting to lose his virginity: an abrasive but likable pairing, with Roger having to confront uncomfortable truths. Moodily shot in midnight blue, it also has beautifully touching performances from Elizabeth Berkley and Jennifer Beals as two women sadly on the wane.
