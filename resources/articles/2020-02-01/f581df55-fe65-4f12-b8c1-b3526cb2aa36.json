When the group set out to climb Britain\u2019s highest peak on Monday as Storm Ciara raged, they had no ice axes or crampons, and did not appear to have a map, said Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team (LMRT), a registered charity. The rescuers, all volunteers with the charity, said the group would have had little or no chance of survival, had they not been found that evening after calling 999. Miller Harris, a member of the rescue team, said the men were verging on hypothermia when they were airlifted to safety, and he doubted they would have survived many more hours in wintry conditions as \u201cserious as they are going to get\u201d. Harris said the group had taken a taxi from Fort William to the start of the \u201ctourist path\u201d up the mountain. \u201cThey were 15 minutes from being in the town to being in a serious location and situation. \u201cAny walk up into the Scottish mountains at this time of year is a serious undertaking and we would expect anyone that is a member of a climbing club to know that. But, for the general public who come up on holiday, it\u2019s difficult to get information to them. People see it\u2019s called a tourist path so they think it is an easy walk up.\u201d Harris said there were winds of up to 100mph and windchill was causing temperatures of -20C at the summit. The group was found on steep ice near the summit, and he said going a few metres further would have posed serious risk. \u201cThey were lucky in the sense that where they were had phone signal, if it hadn\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t have known they were there,\u201d he said. \u201cThey certainly wouldn\u2019t have survived the night.\u201d The group used the what3words app to pinpoint their location. The mountain rescue team was called out around noon on Monday, and 22 members were involved in the search operation, which concluded around 7.30pm. \u201cExtremely lucky people. No winter kit \u2013 no ice axes, no crampons and, as far as we are aware, no maps. Three of the guys were in trainers,\u201d the team said on Facebook after it had been confirmed the men had been airlifted to safety. \u201cThey were about 150m down into Coire Eoghainn on steep ice and if they had slipped or gone down any further consequences could have far more serious. Fantastic effort by the team members to find them and get them down safely.\u201d The group was taken to Belford hospital in Fort William and all the men have since been released."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
