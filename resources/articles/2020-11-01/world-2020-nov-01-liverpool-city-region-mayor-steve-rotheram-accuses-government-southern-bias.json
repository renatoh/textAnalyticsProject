The mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool city region, which were among the first parts of the country to be subject to tier 3 restrictions, expressed anger at Westminster\u2019s \u201cdifferential\u201d treatment of workers in the north of England at a press conference on Sunday. \u201cThis morning millions of people woke up knowing the prime minister of this country believes the north is worth less than the south,\u201d Steve Rotheram, the Liverpool city region mayor, said. \u201cQuite frankly, the government has treated us with contempt again.\u201d Announcing England\u2019s month-long shutdown on Saturday night, Boris Johnson extended the furlough scheme until December, with the government paying 80% of workers\u2019 wages. But last month, the government had been \u201cunequivocal\u201d in refusing to stump up more than two-thirds of the pay of hospitality workers across the north whose businesses were forced to close under tier 3 measures, Rotheram told the conference. The mayor added that \u201cred wall\u201d areas would not be \u201cfooled\u201d into electing the Conservatives again. \u201cI can assure the government that the people of the north won\u2019t easily forget that they were judged to be worth less than their southern counterparts,\u201d he said. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, called for an end to the government\u2019s \u201cdifferential treatment\u201d of people on low wages and \u201cpeople in the north versus people in the south\u201d. Talks between Burnham and the government collapsed 12 days ago over a difference of \u00a35m \u2013 less than \u00a32 for each of Greater Manchester\u2019s 2.8 million residents \u2013 after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, refused to pay tier 3 furlough at 80%. Sunak tweeted the news of his change of heart on Saturday night, prompting Burnham to respond: \u201cBut when we asked you to do that for the lowest-paid people in the north, you refused. People here will remember that.\u201d At the conference, Burnham added that people in the region had \u201cjust completed three months of morale-sapping restrictions, and now they are waking up to the prospect of a month of even tougher restrictions\u201d. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t believe that is understood in Westminster, that already, people have been ground down by the restrictions they have been living under, and they need to understand that before we go any further forward,\u201d he said. Burnham also called for work to be done on a \u201csubstantial localisation\u201d of the test-and-trace system, for self-employed people to be financially supported and for schools to close for two weeks for a \u201ctrue circuit break\u201d. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, rejected the accusations of differential treatment, saying it was fair to offer more now because the national restrictions were more onerous. Gove told BBC One\u2019s Andrew Marr Show he had \u201chuge respect\u201d for Rotheram but that \u201cworkers, whether they are in the north or in the south are being asked, families are being asked, to do more than was the case even in tier 3 areas\u201d. He said those offered two-thirds furlough last month could have topped up their wages to 80% or more with universal credit. Anger and frustration was building across the north of England on Sunday, particularly from pub landlords who had spent time and money rushing to offer \u201csubstantial meals\u201d to comply with restrictions, who will now have to shut on Thursday regardless. There was particular frustration in West Yorkshire, which reluctantly agreed on Thursday to go into tier 3. Pubs were due to shut in the region on Monday, with some working round the clock to find a way to stay open by serving \u201csubstantial meals\u201d and effectively operating as a restaurant. But now they must close on Thursday but can stay open until then, after tier 3 was cancelled for West Yorkshire. In Bradford, Daniel Horsman, a pub landlord, had spent Saturday making 150 pies he hoped to sell to every customer next week with their pints. He has run the Jacob\u2019s Well since 2018 and complains of having to \u201ccompletely redesign my business model every few weeks when the government changes its mind\u201d. There have been seven different rule changes since he was able to reopen in July. \u201cIt\u2019s been bloody knackering,\u201d he said, admitting there were times he considered shutting completely. \u201cIt has been extremely frustrating and I do feel angry at the way this has all been orchestrated, with late-night, last-minute changes.\u201d He does not know whether he will be able to stay open during the lockdown by offering takeaway pies, saying it will not make financial sense if doing so would disqualify him for any business grant. In a statement, West Yorkshire council leaders said: \u201cFollowing several days of intense discussions with ministers about the introduction of new restrictions in West Yorkshire, we are frustrated and angry about the government\u2019s timing, handling and communications around the plans for a national lockdown. \u201cFirstly, for our residents and businesses, we must clear up understandable confusion: the region will now NOT be moving into tier 3 (very high) measures on Monday as planned; we will remain in tier 2 (high) restrictions, and then follow the national measures from Thursday 5 November until Wednesday 2 December. \u201cThe residents and businesses of West Yorkshire had only just begun to prepare for tier 3 measures to hit on Monday, and they are now having to change their plans once again. \u201cWe have worked hard over the last few days to advocate for the people and businesses of West Yorkshire. It is imperative that government now honours the financial commitments made to the people and businesses of the region during these discussions in writing again now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
