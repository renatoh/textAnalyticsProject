But following his claim that it would have been \u201ccommon sense\u201d to ignore fire brigade advice and flee the Grenfell tower block fire \u2013 a statement that prompted outrage \u2013 he went uncharacteristically quiet after apologising. The rapper Stormzy added to the condemnation and calls for Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, to resign following his comments on Monday about the west London fire in 2017 in which 72 people died. As the general election campaign kicked off following the dissolution of parliament, the Tory minister kept a low profile on Wednesday. At his \u00a35.6m townhouse in Westminster, which once served as a political HQ for Lord Ashcroft, a big donor to the Conservatives, a camera crew had been waiting since the morning to no avail. The property had visible posters in a fourth-floor window bearing \u201cLeave means leave\u201d and \u201cNo deal? No problem\u201d slogans. A blue Conservative placard was prominently displayed in a downstairs window. When the Guardian knocked on the door, a woman who answered suggested Rees-Mogg was not in. The politician spoke in the Commons on Tuesday evening for nine minutes to close a valedictory debate, but rumours had since swirled that he could have left for his constituency in north-east Somerset, where he defends a comfortable 10,000 majority. Hours earlier on Tuesday, he had issued an apology for his comments about Grenfell residents, saying: \u201cWhat I meant to say is that I would have also listened to the fire brigade\u2019s advice to stay and wait at the time. However, with what we know now and with hindsight I wouldn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t think anyone else would.\u201d A call to his office in Somerset on Wednesday brought a response from an answerphone message proudly declaring callers had reached Rees-Mogg\u2019s election campaign HQ. Undeterred, the Guardian waited at Rees-Mogg\u2019s house. A short while later, a white cab crawled up outside the property and out of the house walked the prospective MP. With characteristic politeness, he said: \u201cHello there, nice to see you.\u201d But when asked if he would bow to Stormzy\u2019s call for him to resign, he smiled as he got into the taxi, and simply said: \u201cThank you so much.\u201d Matters had worsened for him when the prospective Tory MP Andrew Bridgen clumsily defended Rees-Mogg\u2019s Grenfell tower comments by suggesting the leader of the House was cleverer than the fire service chiefs who had ordered the property\u2019s residents to stay put. \u201cWhat [Rees-Mogg] is actually saying is that he would have made a better decision than the authority figures who gave that advice,\u201d Bridgen told Evan Davis, the presenter of BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme. Asked by Davis if Rees-Mogg was implying that he was cleverer than most people, Bridgen replied: \u201cBut we want very clever people running the country, don\u2019t we, Evan? That is a byproduct of what Jacob is and that is why he is in a position of authority.\u201d Fast forward to Wednesday morning at 6.13am, and Bridgen too was apologising. He tweeted: \u201cI realise that what I said was wrong and caused a great deal of distress and offence. It was not my intention to do so, and I do not want to add in any way to the pain that this tragic event has caused. I apologise unreservedly.\u201d The Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, also weighed in, telling BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cJacob recognises that what he said was wrong and caused a huge amount of hurt and distress. He has apologised unreservedly and I do think that is the right thing for him to do.\u201d With no further sign of Rees-Mogg on Wednesday afternoon, perhaps Conservative party campaign chiefs have also decided the right thing for him to do now is keep his head down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
