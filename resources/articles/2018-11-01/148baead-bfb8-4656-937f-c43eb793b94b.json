Fresh from his side\u2019s one-point escape at Twickenham, Hansen had only just arrived in Dublin when he said the Ireland Test, which pits the two top ranked rugby nations against each other, will be treated as a World Cup knockout game. \u201cIt\u2019s one and two so whoever wins it will be the best side in the world regardless of rankings \u2013 that\u2019s the mental state that people will take out of it so it\u2019ll be a goody,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about it, there\u2019s enough experience in the group to know they don\u2019t get any bigger. You don\u2019t get to play one and two that often when they\u2019re in separate hemispheres so when they do come about they become pretty big games. There\u2019s a fierce rivalry there.\u201d The past three meetings between Ireland and the All Blacks captured the attention of the rugby world. In 2013 the All Blacks pulled off a miraculous comeback by finishing a length-of-the-field try and sideline conversion \u2013 on the second attempt \u2013 to secure the first unbeaten season of the professional era. Three years later the New Zealand\u2011born Ireland coach, Joe Schmidt, inspired Ireland to their first win against the All Blacks in Chicago, only for Hansen\u2019s men to return serve in Dublin two weeks later. Schmidt, expecting another tight, torrid contest, is still recovering from 2013. \u201cThe game in 2013: I\u2019m still bleeding from that. It hurts when that happens,\u201d he said. \u201cChicago was a great band aid, but two weeks later we were very, very much in the game, and it was very tough, very, very tough. \u201cThe challenge for our guys is to step up. I\u2019m confident they can. But at the same time I\u2019m well aware of the challenges the All Blacks present.\u201d The All Blacks will be without Sonny Bill Williams, who suffered a shoulder injury against England, but Hansen stirred the pot somewhat by confidently predicting influential Irish halfback Conor Murray will return from a neck complaint despite last playing in June. \u201cHe\u2019s a real competitor, he\u2019ll want to play and if he\u2019s got a chance I\u2019m picking he\u2019ll play.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
