He prefers the harsh drama of a wet winter landscape, with naked trees against a metallic sky as the light drains from a grim afternoon in December or January. The handful of landscape photographs he takes each year are done in the winter months, and he has been accused of making them look like war scenes, full of a sense of threat - like his most famous photojournalism shot in conflicts from Vietnam to Afghanistan. McCullin says he always looks for drama and a sense of conflict with the elements, and he usually finds it in the Somerset Levels, the huge area of drained marshland inland from the town of Bridgwater. \"This is the time of year I go down to the Levels. I go to see the skies and make a marriage of the skies and the flooded land,\" he says. \"I go in a very solitary, humble way: I just get my wellingtons on and splash through the meadows with my camera and tripod. \"You see these naked trees standing in flooded fields, and there's no question about it, it's awe-inspiring. I go very much as an explorer, hoping to have a confrontation with the elements. I don't want a landscape like the cover of a chocolate box - I want it angry, wild, flooded and naked.\" McCullin has always been a walker, often while working: \"I've walked over the mountains of New Guinea and across Afghanistan for 150 miles when my feet have been bleeding and Russian MiGs have been diving on me and I've been hiding under mulberry bushes, bedding down with camels at night. \"I'm still a good walker at 65, and my mind walks as much as my body. It's totally therapeutic and free, and when I come back I find I'm healed from things that have confused or upset me.\" He says his visits to the Levels are never planned or methodical, so he finds it hard to describe a definite route. But he will often go to the vantage point of Glastonbury, with its famous Tor and New Age atmosphere, before striking out into the Levels. \"I walk through the fields and meadows, looking for the unexpected,\" he says. \"I remember once waiting there to see the sun go down, when I heard this splashing noise behind me, and it was an otter moving down a dyke with an eel in its mouth. Things like that happen when you're doing photography - another time, I was standing still in a forest when a fox came past within 15ft of me. \"In the Levels, I'm trying to get a mood of mystery, mythology and spiritual energy. Quite honestly, I could photograph the area between now and when I leave this earth and I'd still not do it justice. Sometimes when I see the drama of the winter skies, I think of things like Wagner, I think of the old Arthurian legends, and these things encourage me to stick it out and stay there when the rain is peeing on me, my hands are freezing cold and I can hardly load my film. \"That's when I'm at my happiest: it's like an anointment of joy for me to have everything going in ways which other people might think horribly ugly and bad. I like looking at the drama of it all. And it's really great when you come home and get in a hot bath and make yourself a cup of tea - that's what being an Englishman's all about, isn't it? It's called masochism.\" A level playing field The Somerset Levels, divided into northern and southern sections by the 500ft ridge of the Polden Hills, were entirely flooded until Roman times. According to local legend, Joseph of Arimathea and his nephew Jesus sailed up to Glastonbury, at the eastern end of the Levels, where they planted the Holy Thorn. Serious drainage began in the Middle Ages and was completed during the agricultural-improvement drive of recent centuries. Now, there are plans to raise the water levels again to foster birdlife and distinctive wetland plants. The flat, narrow roads of the Levels are ideal for cycling, and Somerset County Council has produced leaflets on four recommended circuits. Walkers need good maps to follow marked footpaths or the ancient droveways used to take animals to summer pasture: rights of way on the droveways are uncertain, but most landowners don't object to walkers. The best walking is probably in the southern part of the Levels along the 50-mile River Parrett Trail on either side of Langport.
