According to weekend reports, a Jersey-based investment firm, Belgravia Group, has made an approach to Newcastle's major shareholder, Sir John Hall, who has a 28.8% stake. Belgravia is said to have held extensive talks with Sir John, whose son, Douglas, holds a further 12%. But the 28% stake held by the chairman, Freddy Shepherd, could prove a sticking point as he has resisted approaches to sell out. Last week the board of the Premiership club Aston Villa accepted a \u00a362.6m bid from US billionaire Randy Lerner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
