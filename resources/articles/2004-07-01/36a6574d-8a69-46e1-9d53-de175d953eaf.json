This means that the bottom two clubs will be relegated next year, with the National League One winners joining the French franchise in the 2006 Super League. The National League clubs had feared the introduction of a play-off between their champions and the 11th-placed Super League team and made their opposition clear to the Rugby Football League's executive chairman Richard Lewis. Lewis passed on the views to the 12 current Super League clubs on Wednesday and they responded by voting to maintain the automatic promotion and relegation. That will be good news for the team relegated this season as it means they will be able to bounce straight back by winning the National League One. But it could be bad news for this year's National League champion, who will have to finish 10th next season to remain in the Super League. Leigh, the favourites to make it this year, have the chance to strike a blow against one of their potential grand final rivals, Hull Kingston Rovers, in the Arriva Trains Cup final in Rochdale tomorrow. The York City Knights, in National League Two, have terminated the contract of their wing Alex Godfrey after his appeal against a two-year drugs ban was rejected yesterday. Godfrey, who maintains his innocence, tested positive for benzoylecgonine, which is found in cocaine. Richard Swain has given Hull a major lift ahead of tonight's Super League game against St Helens by signing a one-year extension to his contract, which now runs until the end of 2006. The 29-year-old New Zealand hooker will be joined by his former Kiwi and Melbourne Storm team-mate Stephen Kearney at the KC Stadium next season. Victory over Saints will lift Hull into second in the table and allow Leeds to open a five-point gap if they beat the struggling Broncos in London tomorrow. However, London have their Australian prop Andrew Hart and England A stand-off Rob Purdham returning from injuries. Castleford have the chance to increase the pressure on the Broncos with a home game against Huddersfield, whose rivals for the sixth and last play-off spot, Wakefield Trinity and Warrington, meet in another important match at Belle Vue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
