By the time I noticed that I'd taken a seat opposite a young man having some kind of telephonic breakdown, it would have been rude to get up and walk away, so I just listened. Man (desperate) \"I don't mind being a barman, it's just \u2026\" He ran his hands through paper and polystyrene garbage on the table while the voice on the phone replied. Man (getting much louder than normal discourse) \"He expects me to do all of his dirty work and be happy about it. He can fuck off. I've got a degree; what has he got?\" He grabbed great clumps of his own hair while that got answered. Man \"There's just so much shit I take!\" He looked at me, I looked away. Man \"It's just been unbearable for the past week. He knows now that I don't like him \u2026\" More advice came down the phone; he started to look even madder. Man \"If he does what?\" He banged his palm on the table. Man \"I've already said this, Mum, I've already said it \u2026 he takes it personally. He doesn't like me at all now \u2026 I don't get along with him, ever, ever. It's got to the point where, even though he's trying to be nice, I don't want him to be nice.\" He listened for a second, and then interrupted. Man \"Why should I? OK, then I don't need to make him happy, I don't need to do anything for him.\" He looked like he was calming down, and I left. Whatever his problems, I had what I came for, a pound's-worth of food and quarter of a page of prose."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
