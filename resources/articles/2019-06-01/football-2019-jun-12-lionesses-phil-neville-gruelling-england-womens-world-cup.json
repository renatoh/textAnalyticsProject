In a telling cameo, he gathered England\u2019s players in a post-match huddle, appearing distinctly stern, almost scary, as he deconstructed a disappointing second-half performance in ruthlessly admonitory fashion. No matter that the Lionesses had beaten Scotland 2-1 in Nice, leaving them top of Group D as they prepare for Friday night\u2019s game against Argentina in Le Havre \u2013 they had strayed from their manager\u2019s pass\u2011and-move mantra. Philosophy is a loaded word in football. Some coaches loathe it and others love it but it matters deeply to Neville, who has been on a mission to transform England from calculating counterattacking pragmatists to fluent, ball\u2011monopolising, highly principled, attacking stylists since taking the job. Considering England reached the semi-finals of the last World Cup and European Championship before his installation, ripping up a successful blueprint and attempting to start again represents a brave move but Neville does not really do half measures. \u201cWe have a good relationship with Phil,\u201d says the Chelsea playmaker Fran Kirby. \u201cWe know the expectations he has and that, if we don\u2019t provide what he wants, we\u2019ll get told. We need to make sure we fix it up against Argentina.\u201d Neville\u2019s problem is that, for many of his squad, England\u2019s old style remains the default mode they resort to when they become tired or lose control of games, as happened amid the humidity in Nice on Sunday night. Given this is the first major tournament the Lionesses have faced since the English domestic game\u2019s switch to a winter season, the philosophical transition could arguably become an increasingly contentious issue if the team advance deeper into the tournament. \u201cThe style of play is different now,\u201d says Kirby. \u201cBefore it was long-ball orientated. It was: \u2018Make sure you\u2019re fitter than everyone else when you run after the ball.\u2019 Now we use our fitness in other ways. \u201cUnder Mark [Sampson, Neville\u2019s predecessor] we had this thing: \u2018Be the fittest team.\u2019 Now we\u2019re more conscious of how we\u2019re playing. The volume of training is more touches on the ball, more possession. It\u2019s more technical work. That\u2019s probably the biggest difference.\u201d So far so good, but the past two tournaments took place during mid-season breaks in the English domestic programme, dictating that the Lionesses enjoyed lengthy physical preparation, including hot-weather training camps before Canada 2015 and Euro 2017. They limbered up for the latter tournament in the Netherlands amid the heat of Valencia. This time players\u2019 club commitments meant Neville\u2019s only comparable such exercise was a trip to Doha in January when the weather was significantly cooler than that experienced in Nice, where Kirby says England \u201clost their legs\u201d in the second half. Moreover England\u2019s manager scrapped most of the planned training sessions in Qatar, opting to give his players a rest and concentrate on bonding exercises, most notably a camping trip to the desert. Keira Walsh remains unconcerned. The Manchester City defensive central midfielder has come to the fore under Neville and is adamant she is not exhausted by the campaign behind her. \u201cI don\u2019t think any player is thinking about the long season we\u2019ve just had,\u201d she says, relaxing at the team\u2019s new training base amid the genteel charms and restorative serenity of Deauville on the Normandy coast. \u201cWe\u2019re at a World Cup; I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s thinking about how many games they\u2019ve played or how fatigued they feel. We\u2019re all ready to go and win the World Cup.\u201d Many managers talk about their team playing like Barcelona only to indulge in serious compromise when they meet technically assured opponents, but Neville is big on bravery and calculated risk, and is not given to U-turns. Accordingly Walsh is not expecting any volte-face. \u201cPhil\u2019s always telling us to keep calm and keep the ball and play passes,\u201d she says. \u201cHe has this thing where he says \u2018rondos\u2019. That echoes, like playing short passes, keeping the ball. I think we\u2019re always going to try and do that. \u201cWe have our tactics and Phil\u2019s going to always stick with them. Obviously no team\u2019s in complete control for 90 minutes and there\u2019s going to be times when you\u2019re under pressure and you\u2019re going to play the ball a little longer but, overall, the style\u2019s going to remain the same. We know what we\u2019re good at \u2013 and that\u2019s keeping possession and creating chances through that possession.\u201d Critics have pointed out that Scotland\u2019s goal in Nice arrived after a rare error from Steph Houghton, England\u2019s captain, at a point when she was arguably trying to overplay at the back. Walsh does concede that a passing-based approach can be mentally draining at times but still sees a bigger picture. \u201cI think it is mentally fatiguing,\u201d she acknowledges. \u201cIt\u2019s more mentally than physically tiring. We\u2019ve got to think about positioning, getting our body on the half-turn and getting in pockets of space. \u201cBut if you let the ball do the work it saves physical energy. Although the passing game is mentally fatiguing, physically it\u2019s a lot easier than having to chase the ball, so we\u2019re going to stick with Phil\u2019s style. We\u2019re confident in what we\u2019re capable of.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
