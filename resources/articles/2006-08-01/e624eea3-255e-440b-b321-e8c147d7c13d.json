The last official statement from Stamford Bridge declared the club's reported \u00a316.5m offer for Cole to have been a \"final offer\". However, Kenyon spoke to confirm reports that there remains room for discussion. \"I'd like to think he [Cole] will be part of our team,\" said Kenyon at the Champions League draw in Monaco. \"We've seven days to find out whether he will or he won't, but we're in discussions with Arsenal. Those discussions have been going on for several weeks and they'll be going on for another few days. We just need to agree a price so I'm optimistic, although I think it's fair to say it will go to the wire.\" Arsenal are hopeful of taking William Gallas as part of the deal but it is understood that from Chelsea's point of view if the Frenchman moves, there would be no cash adjustment. Since last season's Champions League finalists value the England left-back as being at least \u00a310m more than the 29-year-old France defender, there seems little prospect of that. The Gunners did offer \u00a35m for Gallas, an offer Kenyon explained had been shunned. \"We rejected an offer, but I know they are interested in him and would still like him to be part of the deal,\" said Kenyon. \"Even if he isn't we don't think it will stop us from getting Ashley Cole.\" Arsenal's vice-chairman David Dein provided his club's perspective. \"We have made it clear we would like William Gallas,\" he said. \"When we negotiate it has to be at a level right for our budget, but there is no progress to relate.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
