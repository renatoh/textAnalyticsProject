Here\u2019s where things stand: President Donald Trump issued a statement saying that he would stand with Saudi Arabia and later said \u201cit is what it is\u201d with regards to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Trump\u2019s lawyers say that they have submitted written answers to questions from special counsel Robert Mueller. The New York Times is reporting that Trump wanted the Justice Department to prosecute Hillary Clinton and James Comey. The final debate of the cycle will be held tonight in Mississippi where Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith will square off against Democrat Mike Espy in the special election runoff for U.S. Senate. It looks like Nancy Pelosi may have made a deal with potential rival Marcia Fudge. Her office announces that Fudge will take control of a new congressional subcommittee. Trump has received another harsh rebuke from a Senate Republican for his comments on Saudi Arabia.. This time from Bob Corker, the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Ohio is resuming its controversial practice of purging voters from the rolls. The state\u2019s policy as described by the Columbus Dispatch is as follows: Any registered voter who doesn\u2019t cast a ballot for two consecutive elections are sent a registration confirmation notice by their county elections board. If they do not respond and do not vote over the ensuing four years, they are removed from the rolls and must re-register before they can vote again. Lindsey Graham has joined the chorus of Republicans criticizing Trump\u2019s statement on Saudi Arabia today \u201cIt is not in our national security interests to look the other way when it comes to the brutal murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. \u201cI firmly believe there will be strong bipartisan support for serious sanctions against Saudi Arabia, including appropriate members of the royal family, for this barbaric act which defied all civilized norms. While Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally, the behavior of the Crown Prince \u2013 in multiple ways \u2013 has shown disrespect for the relationship and made him, in my view, beyond toxic. \u201cI fully realize we have to deal with bad actors and imperfect situations on the international stage. However, when we lose our moral voice, we lose our strongest asset.\u201d The New York Times is reporting that Trump wanted the Justice Department to prosecute both Hillary Clinton and Jim Comey and had to be talked out of it by White House counsel Don McGahn. McGahn wrote a memo to dissuade Trump noting that the potential consequences for such an action could include impeachment. There are more details out now about the allegations of domestic violence against Michael Avenatti, the trial lawyer and potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. Trump\u2019s lawyers have formally submitted their answers to written questions from special counsel Robert Mueller and his lawyers. The Senate races in 2020 are already starting. Alabama state auditor Jim Zeigler announced today that he contemplating a Senate bid against Doug Jones, the Democrat who won the special election in the Yellowhammer State last year. The Washington Post reports that Matt Whitaker, the acting attorney general, was paid over $1.2 million over three years while leading the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a conservative non profit that focused on criticizing Hillary Clinton. Whitaker was the only employee of the organization. Despite their pardon today, Peas and Carrots do not have a very high life expectancy as Politico reports: Like all other turkeys that are raised for human consumption, they\u2019ve been bred to be plump and tasty, but they grow so big that they are likely to suffer from a variety of health problems that put their lifespan at less than a year. Wild turkeys generally live three to five years. Utah has officially approved anti gerrymandering ballot measure that was on the ballot two weeks ago. If you\u2019re a fan of pro Trump paintings, there is a new one out depicting him as a football player running towards the end zone while Democrats lag behind in an attempt to tackle him. Trump defends Cindy Hyde-Smith and goes further in apologizing on her behalf for her public hanging gaffe that she has. \u201cShe made a statement that I know she feels very bad about it,\u201d says Trump. Trump insists to reporters that his approach to Saudi Arabia is \u201cMake America Great Again and America First.\u201d Trump says \u201cthe written answers\u201d are finished for special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation or \u201cthe witch hunt\u201d as he called it. Trump says he finished them yesterday. Trump strikes a different tone on Saudi Arabia now than he did early in his candidacy while talking to reporters. Rand Paul has harsh criticism for Trump\u2019s approach to Saudi Arabia. The President has followed up his statement while talking to reporters at the White House. Former President Barack Obama declined to answer today when asked if he could beat Donald Trump if he was a candidate in the 2020 presidential election. The Washington Post has released a statement on Trump\u2019s comments today about Saudi Arabia. Appointed Republican incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith has made a number of demands in advance of tonight\u2019s debate in the runoff in Mississippi\u2019s special election for U.S. Senate. These apparently include no media or audience allowed in the room as well as the ability for her to bring notes on stage with her. As more results come in, the Democratic lead in the midterms is growing. Democrats now have an 8 point lead in the national congressional vote. We may get another recount. Democrat Carolyn Bordeaux is asking for recount in her race against incumbent Republican Rob Woodall in Georgia\u2019s seventh congressional district. Woodall leads by 419 votes. When asked about Trump\u2019s statement on Saudi Arabia by reporters at the state department, Mike Pompeo said: \u201cIt is a mean, nasty world out there.\u201d New York has long had some of the most restrictive election laws in the country. However, they are expected to change next year with the new Democratic majority in the state senate. Currently the state does not have absentee voting and voters wishing to change their party registration have to do so a year before a party primary in order to vote in it. Donald Trump has his highest marks yet on his handing of the economy according to a new poll from Quinnipiac University. 53% of Americans approve. However, 54% don\u2019t approve of how the president is doing his job overall and 58% think he is not honest and 63% believe he is not level headed. The Buffalo News has a detailed account of Democrat Nate McMurray\u2019s likely unsuccessful campaign for Congress against Chris Collins, a Republican incumbent under indictment, and how chaos at the top of the campaign may have doomed it. The race has not yet been called but Collins is considered likely to win re-election. Quinnipiac University has a poll of Democrats that has a majority of Democrats and Democrat leaners supporting Pelosi to be Speaker. The Guardian has a live stream of Trump\u2019s forthcoming turkey pardoning which is available below. A Facebook post has surfaced of Cindy Hyde-Smith, the appointed incumbent in the Mississippi Senate runoff, wearing a Confederate hat. The picture was taken during a 2014 visit to the Jefferson Davis Home and Presidential Library in the state with the caption \u201cMississippi history at its best\u201d Hyde-Smith has faced controversy in recent days over comments about public hanging that have been seen as racially loaded in light of Mississippi\u2019s fraught history. She faces off against Democrat Mike Espy next week In the aftermath of the murder of the Washington Post\u2019s Jamal Khashoggi, the White House has released a statement from the president where he expresses his support for continued close ties with the Saudis. The full letter which starts \u201cthe world is a very dangerous place\u201d is below. This is a key excerpt. The crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body. Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2013 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2013 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t! That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world! Jerry Nadler of New York, who will lead the House judiciary committee next year, has written several cabinet members to notify them that his committee will investigate the Trump administration\u2019s immigration and family detention policies next year. Conservatives are pressuring Mitch McConnell to allow a vote on the criminal justice reform bill backed by Donald Trump before the end of the lame duck session of Congress. The bill has bipartisan backing but is strongly opposed by a cadre of Republicans led by Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Acting attorney general Matt Whitaker\u2019s financial disclosure forms are expected to be released as soon as today. The House ethics committee has just sent out a letter urging action on legislation on sexual harassment on Capitol Hill. If no bill is passed during the lame duck, the legislative process will have to start over. Per British reporter David Martosko who is the pool reporter at the White House today, the White House will not identify the turkey that just visited the briefing room. White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters declined to say whether the bird was \u201cPeas\u201d or \u201cCarrots\u201d. She noted that online voting had just concluded to determine which bird President Trump will \u201cpardon\u201d at 1.00pm in the Rose Garden. \u201cWe\u2019re not telling you which one this is,\u201d Walters said. Both Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams had issues at their polling places on election day in Georgia. This is something that doesn\u2019t bode all for the election process in the Peach state. There may not be press briefings any more at the White House but there is now poultry instead. Another newly elected Democrat from a traditionally Republican district is committing to vote for Pelosi in January. The banquet business at Mar-a-Lago has still not recovered from Trump\u2019s comments on Charlottesville. Only two of the 22 groups that cancelled their events at Trump\u2019s private club last year are holding them this year. David Farenthold at the Washington Post reports that the gala business there has not recovered. A survey by the Washington Post could only find six groups planning big-money evening banquets this winter at the club, where Trump is scheduled to arrive Tuesday for Thanksgiving. Several are new clients, aligned with Trump\u2019s politics, including a group of young conservatives and a gathering of superfans called Trumpettes USA. Chuck Schumer has asked the Department of Justice to formally investigate acting attorney general Matt Whitaker\u2019s communications with the White House and, in particular, whether he has shared information about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation with Donald Trump. Democrats swept local elections in Harris county, Texas, home to Houston in the midterm elections. The strong turnout for Beto O\u2019Rourke and prevalence of straight ticket voting ensured a clean sweep for Democrats and may have permanently changed the complexion of governance in one of the most populous jurisdictions in the country. Democrat Ben McAdams has declared victory in Utah\u2019s fourth congressional district, one of four remaining races in the country that have yet to be called. McAdams currently has a 724 vote lead over incumbent Republican Mia Love in the suburban Salt Lake City district. Marcia Fudge, who has been mooted as a possible Pelosi replacement by her opponents in the Democratic caucus, has her own skeletons in the closet. Walmart has asked Cindy Hyde-Smith to refund a donation it made to her campaign after pressure from actress Debra Messing. The company specifically pointed to comments that Hyde-Smith made about attending a hanging. It looks like congressional Democrats will be investigating Ivanka Trump\u2019s use of a personal email to conduct government business next year. The Florida recounts are all officially over as the elections in the Sunshine state have now been officially certified. Manual recounts were required to confirm that Republican governor Rick Scott had beat incumbent Democratic senator Bill Nelson and that Democrat Nikki Fried had bested Republican Matt Caldwell to become state agriculture commissioner. Beto O\u2019Rourke is playing coy on a 2020 presidential bid. He had said during his Senate campaign though that he wouldn\u2019t run for the Oval Office. The Senate runoff in Mississippi is tightening after appointed Republican incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith has made a series of gaffes. However, Democrat Mike Espy still faces an uphill battle in a state where Democrats have been unable to get 45% of the vote, let alone a majority, in recent years. The two will hold the only debate of the runoff tonight. Billionaire Tom Steyer is taking further steps towards a presidential bid and preparing to host a series of town halls across the country. He ran a full page ad as well in USA Today this morning. Seth Moulton, one of the most vocal opponents of Nancy Pelosi returning as speaker, is facing a backlash from constituents. At a town hall that Moulton held in his Massachusetts district yesterday, he faced loud criticism about his opposition to Pelosi. There is a limited field of talented Democratic operatives in Iowa and already potential presidential candidates are courting them. One name mentioned is Andrew Turner, the 23-year-old who led the campaign of the first Democrat to be elected state auditor in decades. A CBS poll of Democrats finds that 49% want Nancy Pelosi to become Speaker and 40% would prefer someone else. The last debate of 2018 will be held tonight in Mississippi and the president will pardon a turkey and fly to Palm Beach. It\u2019s Tuesday in American politics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
