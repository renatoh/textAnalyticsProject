What a stunning result for Manchester United, whose season felt over at the weekend - but now they\u2019re in the quarter finals of the Champions League! It was a fantastic win, because Olympiakos came and gave it a good go: they were simply done over by the sharp brilliance of Robin van Persie, and the stunning goalkeeping of David De Gea. David Moyes bounds out of Old Trafford with a dip in his hip, a glide in his stride, and a huge smile playing across his face, despite his modest efforts to keep it reined in. After all the abuse he\u2019s copped recently, he deserves this result. One of the great European nights at Old Trafford, the first of the Moyes Era - and suddenly there\u2019s the promise of more to come. So will van Persie\u2019s hat-trick come to be seen as Moyes\u2019s Mark Robins moment? It just might, mightn\u2019t it? 90 min +4: Olympiakos flood forward. Campbell curls a ball into the area from the right. For a second, it looks like floating on a Ronaldinhoesque arc over De Gea\u2019s head and into the top left, but United\u2019s world-class keeper isn\u2019t about to have a Seaman moment and steps back to pluck the ball from the sky at the very last minute. He\u2019s been superb. 90 min +3: Giggs plays it short, and United win another corner, precious time ticking by. You didn\u2019t expect a goal, did you? 90 min +2: Fellaini\u2019s first act is to win a corner down the right. From which ... 90 min +1: There will be five added minutes of this. 90 min: Machado, of the opinion that van Persie is swinging the lead, is yellow carded for making that point rather too forcefully at the referee. Ferdinand, ever one to enjoy a nice chat, picks up a booking too for coming across and taking issue with Machado. Van Persie, to be fair, departs the scene on a stretcher, and is replaced by Fellaini. 89 min: Van Persie is down receiving attention, presumably with a view to running down the clock as much as possible. Clever Robin. 87 min: Machado breaks into the United box down the left, but his dangerous cross is headed out for a corner by Jones. Then the set piece is spectacularly punched clear by De Gea, who I reckon is United\u2019s man of the match, despite van Persie\u2019s hat-trick heroics. It\u2019s been a brilliant performance from front to back for United, even if they\u2019ve been a bit shaky every now and then, short of confidence as they are. 85 min: United sitting back. Old Trafford very quiet. A lot of teeth being sucked. Campbell swings a ball into the United area from a deep position on the right, but it sails straight out of play. Clock\u2019s ticking for the Greeks, who will have lost 12 out of 12 on their visits to England after this game, whether they scrape through with a late goal or not. 84 min: Evra earns a free kick down the left by drawing a foul from Vergos. Rooney looks to whip the free kick across goal and into the top right. Roberto punches clear. Then Rooney takes up possession again, and tries a first-time curler into the same corner. It nestles in the top-right corner of the Stretford End. \u201cMoyes\u2019 players have done all they can,\u201d suggests Harry Tuttle. \u201cThe minutes we have left are all Moyes.\u201d 82 min: Welbeck makes way for Fletcher, while Vergos comes on for Fuster. Old Trafford is a tense old place right now! 79 min: Campbell slides the ball down the right for Machado, who whips a dangerous ball into the United box. It\u2019s not dealt with well at all. Corner down the left. Van Persie clears, but Olympiakos are soon coming back at United through Dominguez down the right. He breaks through a weak Evra challenge and sees the whites of De Gea\u2019s eyes! But the keeper is in immense form tonight, and standing firm at his near post, parries not one, but two Domiguez low batters! The ball\u2019s pulled back to Campbell, who wangs a hilariously poor effort over the bar for three rugby union points. 77 min: A change for the home side. Valencia, who has done well to get this far into the match with one eye threatening to close up, is swapped for Young. 75 min: Welbeck wafts his boot over the ball, two yards from goal, missing a tap-in with spectacular ineptitude. Luckily for him, van Persie, who had set him up by cutting the ball across from the inside-left channel, was offside. Even so! 74 min: Paulo Machado replaces Salino. \u201cToo nervous to watch even live text, hence focusing on antique currency debate,\u201d begins Simon Flynn. \u201cOne and four is most definitely 16 pennies.\u201d There\u2019s no point asking me, I\u2019ll believe anyone. I don\u2019t do numbers, I\u2019m still learning shapes. This new \u00a31 coin is going to cause all sorts of problems. 71 min: A corner for United, and within 20 seconds the home side are pinned back in their own area, Dominguez zipping upfield from left to right and eventually setting Salino clear down that wing. A couple of low crosses are sent into the United box from hither and yon. First Rafael bends down to head clear, then Jones takes a turn to deal with it. The home crowd are getting a little bit concerned, though in fairness De Gea hasn\u2019t had too much to deal with, Olympiakos\u2019s approach play impressive but their final ball usually pitiful. 69 min: Holebas attempts to usher the ball out of play down the right, but is stripped of both possession and dignity by van Persie, who nips off cackling. He enters he area, but can\u2019t find a team-mate with a pass. A real chance to hammer home a real bonus there. 68 min: Rooney attempts to relieve the (relative) pressure by raking a long ball down the left channel for Welbeck to chase. The striker gets the jump on the last man, but in an over-excited fashion: before he can break into the box, the flag goes up for offside. 66 min: United are doing that Moyesian thing of sitting back, holding on to what they\u2019ve got. This tactic has come back to bite them in the trousers more than once this season. And here we go, with Salino making good ground down the right and crossing low into the box, where Fuster, on the penalty spot, batters a first-time shot straight at De Gea. The keeper handles well, but a yard either side and he wasn\u2019t getting that. Old Trafford has gone very quiet at the moment. 64 min: Dominguez has a lash from 20 yards, but his effort, seemingly aimed towards the top left, flies miles higher than intended. 62 min: Leandro Salino is booked for an idiotic reaction to a common-or-garden offside decision, the old-fashioned ill-tempered blooter into the crowd. What an eejit. 61 min: Evra is booked for dangling his leg out, studs facing, towards Valdez. He\u2019ll miss the quarter final, should United make it. And as things stand, United are making, while Evra is missing. 60 min: Corner for United down the right. Giggs dribbles inside from the wing, then rolls the ball across the face of the box for Jones, who clubs a dreadful sidefoot miles wide right and high. 58 min: A couple of minutes\u2019 worth of United possession. They go nowhere, but that\u2019s not really the point, they\u2019re taking the sting out of Olympiakos\u2019s response to falling behind in the tie. \u201cI am pleased that you recognised the importance of that Mark Robins goal,\u201d writes preamble peruser Simon McGrother, unaware that I was referring to the one everyone usually bangs on about, from the FA Cup third round at Nottingham Forest in 1990, and not the striker\u2019s slightly less storied but equally vital winner in the semi-final against Oldham. But how was Simon to know? Exactly. \u201cUnited were hopeless that season and Ferguson could have easily lost his job. I wonder if you also recall that that game was 1-1 at full time and that during regulation Nick Henry had thundered one off the underside of the crossbar. TV footage was not absolutely definitive, but it looked like it was probably a goal. If we\u2019d just had hawk-eye (or whatever it\u2019s called) how different the past 24 years might have been. I am not saying better (I am actually), just different.\u201d 56 min: Olympiakos should be back in the driving seat. Rooney is penalised for a leap into N\u2019Dinga down the inside left. Dominguez curls a high ball into the area. Perez, six yards out, somehow guides a header wide left when he surely should have buried it. He\u2019s also run ahead of the United back line too eagerly, and was offside to boot. It\u2019s his last act of the evening, as he\u2019s hooked in favour of Valdez. 54 min: A free kick for Olympiakos, 25 yards out, just to the left of goal. Dominguez sees his free kick deflected dangerously off the wall and only just wide right of De Gea\u2019s goal. The keeper was rooted to the spot there. Nothing comes of the corner. This is a majestic end-to-end match. 53 min: United have been brilliant tonight, in attitude as much as deed. They\u2019re now 3-2 in the lead in this tie. The Dutch master whips a left-footed shot over the wall and into the left-hand side of the net! It wasn\u2019t tucked away in the corner, flying in a yard or so to the left of the static Roberto, who is complaining to his team-mates that he couldn\u2019t see. Who set the wall then, huh? That\u2019s nevertheless a brilliant hat-trick from Robin van Persie, and one that might just have saved the job of a manager the rumour mill suggests he\u2019s not always seen eye to eye with. So who cares?! With enemies like this, who needs friends? 50 min: Welbeck goes on a determined sortie down the inside right, and is eventually bundled over, just in front of the D, roughly level with the right-hand post. Rooney and van Persie stand over it, waiting, contemplating. And ... 49 min: A bit of space for Leandro Salino down the Olympiakos right. A cross into the centre for Perez, who heads lamely wide right of the target from 12 yards. An away goal will put a different complexion on this game alright. 47 min: A period of possession for United ends when Evra tries to scoot past Perez down the left but is easily robbed of the ball. Rooney wins it back and the play\u2019s shifted to the right, where Welbeck wastes good field position in the right-hand side of the area with a dreadful pullback. United on the front foot in the early exchanges of the half, though. \u201cTen for one and four \u2013 that\u2019s 7p,\u201d begins Mark Leadbetter, who may or may not be desirous of starting the second half with a long drag on a cheroot. \u201cInvaluable trick for everyone who needs to convert old money into the newfangled stuff \u2013 put the numbers together and halve it; 1 and 4: 14 - 7p. You\u2019re welcome!\u201d So there you have it. This MBM wasn\u2019t a total waste of everyone\u2019s time after all! And we\u2019re off again! No changes. United will be bombing in the old Fergusonian style towards the Stretford End in this half. If the 2-2 aggregate scoreline stays the same, it\u2019ll be extra time for thee and me. If someone finds the net, we\u2019ll be done and dusted in 90 minutes. Half-time advertisement: Well, well, well! What a first-half performance by United. Olympiakos weren\u2019t half bad, either, so the home side will be very pleased with their efforts so far. What a hammer blow for Olympiakos, right on the stroke of half time. Moyes literally springs all the way down the touchline, a jaunty jog of joy. Inner joy, that is: while the strut betrays his excitement, his face is a picture of determination. Another 45 minutes like that, and his side will be in the quarter finals, and there will still be hopes and dreams for the Moyes Era! There goes that Olympiakos lead! Giggs sprays a delightful diagonal pass down the right wing for Rooney, who takes a couple of steps before firing a low cross into the area. Van Persie meets it first time, six yards out, and slaps a left-footed shot into the bottom right! Old Trafford erupts! It\u2019s all level! This really is on! 44 min: Evra, who is on his comeback tour, makes good down the left, and is clear in the area. He could shoot from a very tight angle, but opts to pull the ball back for a team-mate. Nope. Olympiakos clear. This is a brilliant game! 42 min: Valencia goes after a ball down the inside left. He gets involved in a tussle with Maniatis, and goes down inside the box. You\u2019ve seen them given, though it was six and half a dozen, and would have been a bit harsh on Olympiakos. Not that Valencia sees it that way, and he springs to the floor to make his displeasure known via mime and semaphore. 40 min: WHAT A DOUBLE SAVE BY DE GEA! Perez is allowed the entire right wing by Evra, who has just retired. His low cross is met in the centre by Fuster, who heads straight at De Gea. So far, so average, but then the ball breaks to the left of the six-yard box for Dominguez, who must score. But De Gea starjumps in the Schmeichelian style, and somehow gets a boot to a shot heading for the bottom-left corner! That is a world-class save from a world-class player. Olympiakos, deflated, can\u2019t make anything of the resulting set piece. 37 min: Carrick is upended by Maniatis, who came through the back of his ankles in a very effective manner. No card, though, much to the United midfielder\u2019s displeasure. Then N\u2019Dinga bowls Welbeck to the ground. Giggs sends the resulting free kick high into the crowd behind the goal, then stands around with a face on. 34 min: A corner for United down the right, Valencia really putting in a shift despite that jiggered peeper. The ball\u2019s whipped towards the near post, where Evra flicks towards the top-right corner with goalscoring intent. It\u2019s a wonderful header, and going in until Roberto arches his back and somehow manages to claw it out from under the bar and away for another corner. From which nowt happens. United so close to levelling this tie. One or two aberrations at the back apart, they\u2019ve been very impressive tonight. 31 min: And now United are on the front foot again, Valencia failing to get past Holebas on his first run down the right, before coming back at Olympiakos and firing a low shot-cum-cross straight at Roberto. That was an opportunity for United, had either Rooney or van Persie bothered to take a chance at the near post. 29 min: Old Trafford has its collective tail up, as you\u2019d expect, but the Greeks have decided that coming straight back at their hosts is the best way to dampen their enthusiasm. Leandro Salino juggles the ball down the right wing, then Maniatis threatens to bust into the United box from a position down the inside left. This is a very entertaining game. 27 min: So that\u2019s United having cut the deficit to 1-2. Olympiakos respond well, Dominguez taking up possession just in front of the United area and looking to hammer a shot towards the bottom right-hand corner. The ball\u2019s deflected out for a corner, which causes minor bedlam in the United area, Dominguez given far too much time out on the right to send a low cross in. But Carrick calmly steps in to clear upfield, eventually. Van Persie gets up to take the spot kick himself. And he wraps the inside of his boot round the ball, whipping it into the right-hand side of the net! Roberto went the right way, but couldn\u2019t reach the ball. A fine penalty - and a lovely pass from Rooney to find van Persie to earn the spot kick in the first place! 23 min: PENALTY FOR UNITED! Van Persie is bundled to the floor from behind by Holebas, as he chases a high ball down the inside-right channel. It\u2019s a penalty, no question. What this could do for United\u2019s season - and David Moyes\u2019s career! 22 min: It\u2019s a lovely open end-to-end game, this. Rafael wins a corner off Holebas down the right, but Roberto, occasionally uncertain, comes off his line to claim the corner well. \u201cFor those of us who never liked that \u2018talented friend\u2019,\u201d begins Ian Copestake, \u201chis demise has been like watching a widely disliked football team getting its long awaited comeuppance.\u201d 20 min: United are not looking totally solid at the back. Perez goes on a diddle down the right, and looks to slide the ball inside for Campbell once he reaches the area, but the pass doesn\u2019t quite come off. You could hear quite a few sharp intakes of breath as that move developed. 17 min: UNITED HIT THE POST! More specifically, it\u2019s Rooney, who dribbles a not-particularly-powerful header onto the base of the left-hand post, the striker meeting Giggs\u2019s diagonal left-wing cross. The ball, having beaten the despairing Roberto, bounces back across the face of goal, begging to be tapped in, but there are no United players nearby to take up the opportunity. So close to the game-changing opening goal! 15 min: The set piece is swung in by Rooney from the left, and slapped clear by Roberto, not in a particularly certain fashion it has to be said. Then the Greeks flood upfield, Campbell zipping past Jones with ease down the inside right, then cutting a ball back from the byline for Perez, six yards out, level with the right-hand post. Luckily for United, Perez was leaning back, and his snapped shot flies high and wide right. But that should probably have been the opening goal - and one that would in all likelihood have done for United\u2019s Champions League hopes. 14 min: Welbeck looks pretty lively tonight, and now he goes on a meander down the left wing, winning his team a corner. 11 min: A bit of space and time for Rooney down the right. He whips a low ball in towards his good pal van Persie, and while the striker can\u2019t quite control and get a shot away, his first touch, killing the ball on the spot, six yards from goal in a central position, nearly earns him a shooting chance. But Roberto is out quickly to deal with the situation. There\u2019s a cracking atmosphere in Old Trafford tonight, both sets of fans are clearly up for this. \u201cWatching United this year has actually required developing a drinking problem,\u201d writes Huw Alexander. \u201cPlease send gin. And prawn sandwiches. And a first half goal. Off a shin, if necessary.\u201d 10 min: Two bookings in a minute by an overly fussy referee. First Dominguez is booked for a slide on Valencia down the right. Then Carrick goes in the book for a late toe-poke on Perez. This wouldn\u2019t have happened in the 1950s. 9 min: It\u2019s Valencia v Campbell II, with the United man foolishly bundling the Olympiakos striker over down the left wing, the attacker going nowhere. Why did he do that? Because his left eye now is almost totally shut, perhaps! United will have to keep tabs on that. The resulting free kick comes to nothing, not even beating the first man. 6 min: Rooney whips an inswinging free kick into the area from the left. Roberto stoops to punch clear, a very odd save. The ball falls to Valencia on the right-hand side of the D, but he\u2019s clattered in an accidental collision with Campbell. A huge bump comes up, cartoon-style, over his eye. He\u2019ll be fine to continue, though, by the looks of it. 5 min: Welbeck tears off down the inside-left channel after a clever van Persie pass and is clattered from behind by Manolas. That\u2019s a no-brainer of a booking. If the Greeks get to the quarters, Manolas won\u2019t be playing. 2 min: Jones goes in on N\u2019Dinga, far too enthusiastically. Dominguez swings in a free kick from the right, but his delivery is far too deep. United can\u2019t be giving up too many chances like that, though. \u201cOlympiakos is better,\u201d argues Dimitri Nakassisnakassis of our little style dilemma, \u201cbecause Greek has no letter C and the team is spelled \u039f\u039b\u03a5\u039c\u03a0\u0399\u0391\u039a\u039f\u03a3 (\u039f\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2) in Greek.\u201d Now can you tell me why we don\u2019t give the pope a capital P? And we\u2019re off! Olympiakos set the ball rolling, kicking towards the Stretford End in the first half. Valencia tries to bully Holebas off the ball down the inside-right channel, but he\u2019s a bit too eager. Free kick. But it looks like United have pressing in mind this evening. The teams are out! And you know what that means. An assault by the Uefa marketeers on all the senses, is what it means. Starry balls on banners hither and yon, intrusive hoardings around the pitch, plus the usual bombastic sounds ... United are in their famous red shirts and white breeks, while Olympiakos sport a blue change strip. Or is it black? I can\u2019t quite tell. That doesn\u2019t augur well, does it. Never mind. \u201cTonight is the night we find out whether David Moyes can send out a team to attack, and damn the torpedoes, in the classic Manchester United spirit,\u201d opines Justin Kavanagh. \u201cOr, whether the fear factor that has long been his hallmark means he will be remembered at Old Trafford as The Frozen One.\u201d Ee, they\u2019re punning tonight, ladies and gentlemen. David Moyes speaks! \u201cWe have to try to control the game before we attempt to score a goal ... We\u2019re capable of scoring twice in the last ten minutes if we have to, but of course we\u2019d like to score one before that ... We\u2019re going to try to score an early goal.\u201d Yes, it would be easy to riff on this, his pre-match war cries aren\u2019t exactly Churchillian. But the general attitude to Moyes at the moment smacks a little of the playground pile-on, so let\u2019s leave the man be. He\u2019s saying nothing here that isn\u2019t eminently sensible; United can\u2019t afford to go totally gung-ho, as an Olympiakos goal on the kounter would kause all sorts of trouble. Having said that, Moyes does need to whip the side into a frenzy in private, at least, because they\u2019ve struggled to limply tug at weeds this season, let alone pull up any trees. And now there\u2019s no room left for error: as far as this season goes, tonight is Lisbon or bust. \u201cWatching United this year has been a bit like watching a talented friend developing a drinking problem,\u201d writes Brian Kitt, hitting the nail on the head so sweetly you\u2019ll be able to tune a guitar to his email for the next hour or so. Manchester United make four changes from the Liverpool debacle: De Gea, Da Silva, Jones, Ferdinand, Evra, Welbeck, Giggs, Carrick, Valencia, Rooney, van Persie. Subs: Lindegaard, Hernandez, Young, Fletcher, Kagawa, Fellaini, Januzaj. Olympiakos, whose name is spelt Olympiacos on the club\u2019s official site, and in their official digital correspondence, and by Uefa, the governing body of European football, but not by our style guide, and no, there\u2019s no point asking me why, make just one change from the first leg, with David Fuster coming in for Michael Olaitan: Roberto, Maniatis, Holebas, Manolas, Marcano, Salino, N\u2019Dinga, Perez, Fuster, Campbell, Dominguez. Subs: Megyeri, Paulo Machado, Samaris, Valdez, Papadopoulos, Vergos, Bong. Referee: Bjorn Kuipers (Netherlands). Here\u2019s a game in the last 16 of the Champions League, being contested by Manchester United, one of the most storied clubs in the history of this famous competition \u2026 and all the talk is of their beleaguered new manager, and whether he\u2019ll survive the week. State of modern football, with its immediacy and impatience, dragging us all down. Now admittedly David Moyes hasn\u2019t done a great job at Old Trafford so far. His United side were nothing short of pathetic in the first leg of this tie against Olympiakos, and last weekend they didn\u2019t even bother turning up for the annual donnybrook with Liverpool. It\u2019s fair to say that if his players fail to make significant inroads into the 2-0 halfway lead the Greeks hold in this round-of-16 rubber, and/or receive a symbolic belt in the mouth in the Manchester derby next week, Moyes could either be sent aquaplaning on the seat of his trousers back down the Manchester Ship Canal from whence he came, or at the very least become a lame duck until the end of the season, slowly drowning (though not waving for help as he\u2019s too scared to make any sudden movements). But if we\u2019re painting Moyes into a corner, it\u2019s only fair that the man should be offered a dry route out of trouble, too.United are still the champions of England, whichever way you slice it, and they\u2019re surely better than this. Even during this farcical season, there have been glimmers of hope, and the first leg in Pireaus has been their only misfire in Europe this season so far. In fact, they\u2019ve got a 100 percent record at Old Trafford in the Champions League in this campaign. If they win this one tonight, they\u2019ll be matching their best sequence in the grand old competition since they won the damn thing back in 2008. They\u2019ve got a five-from-five hit rate at home to Greek opposition. And the last two times they\u2019ve hosted a team in the Champions League knockout stages while trailing from the first leg, they\u2019ve won the match: 3-2 against Bayern Munich in 2010, a futile victory admittedly but there it is, and a rather more effective 7-1 against Roma in 2007. United have faced a 2-0 deficit in Uefa competition four times, and have survived twice, against Tottenham Hotspur in the 1963-64 Cup Winners Cup, and Barcelona in the same competition 20 years later. Only Partizan Belgrade (1966) and Milan (1969) have managed to hold them off, and on both occasions those teams made it to the final, Milan winning the pot. That\u2019s not something you\u2019d expect this Olympiakos side to do, though the Greek club has admittedly never let a 2-0 lead slip in Europe. Yet. (As Moyes will surely be at pains to stress to his team.) No, it\u2019s not going to be easy. But as we\u2019ve wedged the Optimism Titfer onto our neeps at an alluring angle, we\u2019re duty bound to note that it can be done. The odds aren\u2019t totally stacked against. And if everyone\u2019s insisting that a defeat tonight could have severe ramifications for the manager, then surely a famous victory must be viewed as a potential catalyst for a better day under Moyes. It\u2019s only fair. So will we look back on this game as the fin of a very short si\u00e8cle? Or will it come to be seen as the match that, against all the odds, lifted the mood and turned the ship around, a Mark Robins moment, or a reimagining of the pressure-releasing 1963 FA Cup final? After all, things occasionally got a bit hairy for Sirs Alex and Matt, too. Time will tell. Perhaps the next 90 or 120 minutes will tell. And the clock starts ticking at 7.45pm GMT. God speed, David Moyes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
