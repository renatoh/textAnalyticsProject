When you are pegging it from Groove Armada to Franz Ferdinand, you hardly have time to pick a fight about the slightly inaccurate grilling someone gave your halibut. It's pretty much a fuel stop. If only the future had done as it was told and given us a meal in a pill, or a nozzle you could just plug into: \"Fill 'er up please. Oh, and can you top up the lager while you're at it?\" Like lots of festival activities, eating in this kind of environment is done with a nervous eye on the next big thing and a worried glance at the 430 others that you are missing. A trip out to food central seems to have everything on offer: \"Baguettes\", \"King Prawnies\" (complete with blowtorched focaccia), \"Kebabs and Fries\". A stall called \"Wok's Happening\" offers a frankly terrifying dish that claims to be \"just like it was in the infamous Dragon Bars of old Kowloon\". One place is very excited about its use of bread: \"Served in a baguette!\" as if that was on a par with \"Served on a bed of naked women!\" Baguette sarnies are a nightmare anyway - they always look like a burst mattress that's been glued back together with mayo. When you're forced to consume on the move, it's easy to become obsessed with how many times you eat. It's the flipside of the festival toilet crisis. At first sight everything looks appealing, but slow down. It isn't. If you peep out the back you can sometimes see what's going into your dinner - and if it looks like someone has just got 20 tonnes of reduced-to-clear supermarket fodder, you may want to pass. There's some pretty rank disguises out there. The \"Good healthy vegetarian food\" van, run by good healthy looking women, proudly uses \"real vegetables\" (as opposed to the ones made out of meat). You can order melted cheese nuggets, pay \u00a34.50, get a little piece of paper with a code on it, and \"take that to the end and they'll prepare you one fresh.\" Actually, they'll lift a ready-made one out of a rack: a cone of tortilla, five lukewarm rubbery balls, and that salad that looks like they threw a cabbage at a lawn mower. Sausages are one of the greatest foods in the world, but they're pretty easy to abuse. Watch out for what tastes like remaindered kebab meat too, which, in a triumph of rebranding has changed its name to \"steak\". Another bugbear is being given your food in kit form, which is about as appealing as buying a pet rabbit in a self-assembly pack. Carbonara is a good idea, but you don't want pasta, creamy stuff and economy ham all sitting on your plate as if they have just fallen out about who should go on top. That said, people are queuing and queuing, so that must mean the store next door, which has practically no one at it, is the devil's pantry. Actually, the Famous Welsh Oggie, which comes in at \u00a33 is great: hot, flakey pastry that melts, rammed with beef, onion, leek, potato and gravy. They also do decent faggots with mash and mushy peas. There are alternatives, predictably enough in the sitar-wielding, wind-powered, teepee universe that lies beyond the glade. It can be a bit annoying round here, especially in the more ludicrously tie-dyed areas, where asking someone where the loo is could kick off an eight-hour existential debate. One couple up here, Mervin and Regina, say that on no account will they be watching any bands at all, which is a pretty odd take on Glastonbury. But they are tucking into a lovely, freshly cooked, thin crust pizza with a good tomato sauce and olives, plus a fine salad. It goes to show that cooking in a field doesn't have to be rank; like any cooking, if the ingredients are any good, and the timing is on, you should be OK. But of course, \"nutrition\" comes in many forms - some of it even claims to change your outlook on the world. So maybe it's time for a hit (legal, of course) over at the Herbal High Company. \"What's your tastiest high then?\" Overlooking the magic Mexican truffles he hands me a packet of four red tablets containing Sida cordifolia: \"The ultimate comprehensive stimulation,\" they reckon. So maybe the future has arrived after all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
