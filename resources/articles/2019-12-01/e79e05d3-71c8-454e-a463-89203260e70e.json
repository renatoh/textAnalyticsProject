He would be turning 32 on 2 November, the same day as the Rugby World Cup final in Japan, and he kept telling himself that, against the odds, things could still fall into place. \u201cI thought it was fate,\u201d he murmurs, as the midweek rain sluices down the Portakabin windows at Gloucester\u2019s Hartpury College training centre. As we now know, the fairytale never quite happened for Cipriani or England. Over the years, famously, the former has become rather better versed in overcoming adversity. Among the books he has read on the subject is a volume called The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph, which examines the Roman philosophy of stoicism. So impressed was Cipriani that he contacted the author, Ryan Holiday, and spent some time with him this summer. The book everyone is currently talking about, however, is Eddie Jones\u2019s newly published autobiography. Within its pages England\u2019s head coach was scathing on the subject of Cipriani\u2019s past off-field scrapes. \u201cWhen a player consistently does stupid things, you don\u2019t expect him to change much.\u201d Jones also brusquely dismissed the glowing headlines generated when Cipriani created a match-clinching try for Jonny May against South Africa in Cape Town last year. \u201cThe reaction from the press was outrageous. They thought Cipriani had proved he was a genius. It was one good moment, but he had been quiet throughout the rest of the game. At the end of the week in Cape Town, Danny was still a distant third behind Owen Farrell and George Ford.\u201d Et tu, Eddie. In the cold light of day, Jones obviously never fancied picking Cipriani in his final World Cup squad. So much for fate and destiny? The fly-half pauses momentarily. If he expresses public disappointment there will be a headline; say nothing and it will gnaw away inside. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ll say is that he said more about me in a book than he\u2019s ever said to me. He\u2019s never said two words to me but I found out everything I need to know from him through a book.\u201d He suddenly looks a little weary. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be the headline because he\u2019s not even in my thinking. If he calls me, great, I\u2019ll have a great conversation with him. Along the way I would have learned stuff from him.\u201d Cipriani\u2019s frustration is understandable enough. It requires scant reading between the lines to suspect that, with Jones due to remain for the next two years, the gifted playmaker will be hard-pushed to play for England again. So is this how it ends: sloshing around in the Gloucestershire mud with only one Test start since 2008? For someone who has never found rejection easy \u2013 he was brought up in south-west London by his hard-working mother, Anne, after his father, Jay, returned to his native Trinidad \u2013 it clearly presents a challenge. By his own admission this autumn has been \u201ctough\u201d mentally. Prior to beating Connacht last Sunday, Gloucester had lost their five previous games. How interesting, then, that Jones\u2019s book extract seems to have coincided with a personal epiphany on and off the field. \u201cFrom a kid to an adult, it\u2019s been rejection for me. How do I face that? Do I keep facing it in the same way and have the same stresses and worries or is there a breaking point? I don\u2019t want the breaking point to be when I\u2019m 60 and then the life lessons click in. It\u2019s gone then, you know? In the last couple of weeks, some things have really fallen into place ... it\u2019s like a penny dropped. \u201cThe World Cup might have been part of it but it would also have been five losses in a row, the constant England thing. It comes to a point ... for me you\u2019ve always got to look internal.\u201d Life, in other words, is too short. The realisation also seems to have dawned \u2013 and the subject has been broached during conversations with his club coach Johan Ackermann \u2013 that enjoying a fruitful closing chapter to his club career is going to demand a different mindset. At Gloucester he has particularly enjoyed the searingly honest advice of teammate Tom Marshall \u2013 \u201che is the truth serum\u201d \u2013 and again spent part of his summer hanging out in Malibu with an eclectic range of people including the surfer-cum-training guru Laird Hamilton. The notion of a more selfless world in which ego becomes secondary increasingly appeals to him. \u201cMy intention to play for England might have been for self, for ego or to prove people wrong. I don\u2019t know fully until I let that go, which in the last couple of weeks you do. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t still want to do it but I\u2019m in a much better frame of mind about it. \u201cFor me it\u2019s been a constant fight. I made mistakes as a kid and suddenly a character gets created. I\u2019m not someone who has a big ego but people keep trying to label me like that over and over again. Maybe I have played up to it at different points of my life but I\u2019d rather make other people look good with how I do things.\u201d Perhaps there is also an element of finally appreciating there are now only limited opportunities left to do what he does best. Genius or not, his left-footed swivel cross-kick directly across his own 22 at Kingsholm last Sunday was gloriously different. A fluke? Hardly. Having watched the Australian rugby league player Cooper Cronk do it previously, Cipriani argues it was simply the best option available. \u201cFor me it was the safer kick because there\u2019s no one out there. What I\u2019ve found interesting during my whole career is that people will say: \u2018Oh, this is the glitz and glamour play\u2019 but I would never try something on the field I haven\u2019t practised 100 times over. I\u2019m not one for just trying something for any reason.\u201d The ticking clock, though, pauses for no one. As a young Wasps player he remembers looking at the 31-year-old fly-half Alex King and thinking: \u2018Fucking hell, he looks so old!\u2019 He now knows how the battered King felt. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m looking to finish when my contract at Gloucester is done but you\u2019ve still got to pay bills, man.\u201d Might that make him a candidate for the Celebrity jungle or the Strictly ballroom? \u201cI\u2019d never do one of those shows. It\u2019s not for me. I might go into business, do some learning, spend some time on a beach, maybe a bit of coaching. I\u2019d like to maybe help a group or help young sportsmen through sharing my experiences \u2013 good and bad, vulnerable and ugly. Hopefully, if something resonates with a young kid then it might help, otherwise my career will have been a bit of a waste. Right now, I\u2019m trying to effect change within the game.\u201d Either way, the most extravagantly gifted playmaker of his generation is determined not to fade into grey anonymity. \u201cI don\u2019t have not staying in the fight in me. All I ever witnessed was my mum staying in the fight. That is in me. How many times have I been turned down to play for England? It\u2019s crazy but it is what it is. \u201cWas my intention right? I don\u2019t know. I always felt like it was but perhaps it was giving off the wrong meaning to people.\u201d An England reprieve may be unlikely now but sometimes fate works in mysterious ways."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
