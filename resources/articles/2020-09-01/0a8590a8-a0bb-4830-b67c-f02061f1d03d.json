Brown, who as chancellor in Tony Blair\u2019s government was responsible for granting the Bank operational freedom to set interest rates, said the UK\u2019s central bank should be more like the US Federal Reserve, which has to take employment as well as inflation into account when making policy decisions. \u201cAll UK institutions have to make high levels of employment a greater priority,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHaving been the chancellor responsible for the Bank of England Act 22 years ago, I am disappointed that while obligations for employment are included in its statutory objectives, the Bank of England does not place greater emphasis on maximising employment.\u201d Since Brown\u2019s reforms, the Bank has had the statutory duty to hit the government\u2019s 2% inflation target, but in recent years \u2013 after the Brexit referendum vote \u2013 has adopted a flexible approach to achieving that goal. Since the start of the Covid-19 crisis, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee has cut interest rates to 0.1% and pumped an additional \u00a3200bn into the economy through the bond-buying programme known as quantitative easing. Brown said a more radical approach was needed. \u201cThe Bank should announce an operational target, that interest rates will not rise or stimulus end until employment returns to its pre-crisis levels. And we should agree a new constitution for the Bank imposing a dual mandate: to take unemployment as seriously as inflation.\u201d The former prime minister made his comments to mark the launch of the Alliance for Full Employment, which has brought together the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, and a number of metropolitan mayors to press for action on jobs. Brown said the government had spent billions on rescuing the economy in the early months of the crisis but was failing to put together a comprehensive plan for recovery. He said measures to help the under-25s were inadequate and compared badly with the more generous scheme Labour had introduced in 2009 when he was prime minister. \u201cYoung people are now facing the worst of times yet the government\u2019s Kickstart youth employment programme will assist only 250,000 of 3.5 million under-25s not in full-time education, and only for six months.\u201d Brown said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, should maintain furlough payments to key sectors of the economy, if necessary supporting part-time work. Austerity, introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition after Labour lost the 2010 election, had always been the wrong policy, Brown said, but made even less sense in the present climate because ultra-low interest rates made it cheap to borrow for long-term investment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
