Yes. There is almost no interest at the top of British politics in the problems of most people. There isn't any politics in Westminster; nobody disagrees about anything. I would like there to be two political parties - one that is strongly conservative, and the other that says out loud, \"Yes, we do want to dissolve the country into the European Union; no, we don't believe criminals should be punished; yes, we do think egalitarianism is more important than education; yes, we think mass immigration is beneficial to the country and if you don't like it, you'll just have to lump it.\" So it's the politics of compromise that you are against? No, not of compromise. I'm against the left. I think the left are wrong about almost everything, and unwilling to recognise that they are wrong because their initial intentions are good and they don't like admitting that there have been bad unintended consequences. But it's not a matter of compromise, its a matter of surrender. The supposed party of the conservative right doesn't actually have any ideas; all it wants is to be in government, therefore it follows - or rather gives into - the left so that it can obtain government. So who will you vote for next? I haven't voted for years. I don't like any of them and the right not to vote is one of our most important freedoms. Doesn't that undermine your argument? You're getting angry about the fact that people aren't interested in politics, but you're telling them to opt out of it? We have a unique opportunity at the next election. The Conservative party could not sustain a fourth election defeat; it would collapse and split if it happened. And then out of the ruins you could make a new opposition. Frankly, I could carve a better opposition party out of a banana than the Tories. You've famously made the journey from far left to Mail on Sunday columnist. Yes. It's what people used to do all the time; it's the standard progression: leftwing in your youth, conservative in your middle age and decrepitude. But the thing that makes me interesting is that I did it, just as everybody used to, and nobody else did. The parliamentary Labour party is crammed full of ex-Trotskyists, many of whom haven't reconstructed their ideas. By your own admission you have earned a reputation as being a sexist, racist homophobe. I don't know about earned. People will call you names; it's a small penalty to be paid for not being one of the bleating flock. If you say anything at all non-conformist you'll be punished for it. Are you deliberately controversial? No. Why would anyone be deliberately controversial? I deliberately say that which I think to be true. If people then say, \"Well, that's controversial\", so be it. Do you wake up and think, \"I'm going to rant this morning\"? No. Rant is one of those words people use. I wake up in the morning quite slowly, like most people. I need an awful lot of coffee before I'm in a position to say anything or, as you put it, rant. Do you think \"rant\" is unfair? I think it's silly. Rant is what you say about somebody you disagree with. If you disagree with somebody, say why you disagree with them, not that you disagree with them. What's the difference between you and your brother [the writer Christopher Hitchens]? Less than people think. We both enjoy arguing. We both have independence of mind. How regularly do you speak to each other? I had dinner at his place three weeks ago. We have the occasional email exchange. We're not close. We're different people, we have different lives, we have entirely different pleasures, we live in different continents. If we weren't brothers we wouldn't know each other. Are you intensely competitive with one another? I am competitive, but I'm competitive in what I do, in my trade. It may be that in some Freudian way I am unconsciously engaging in a contest with my brother. But it's good box office, so I don't discourage people from thinking we're in some kind of contest. We both benefit from it. Once people realised there was a double Hitchens brand, it certainly increased the attention we got."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
