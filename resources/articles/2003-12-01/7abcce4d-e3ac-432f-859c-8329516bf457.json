And an even better one when true greats sign off. In 2003, two logged imperishably in their lore slid from their saddles for the last time - motorcycling's Barry Sheene was 52 when cancer cruelly cut him down; horseracing's Bill Shoemake was 20 years older. A world that had been enriched by two women born into abject poverty in the United States lost Althea Gibson and Gertrude Ederle. Both by their 20s had achieved enough for millions to acclaim them with a tickertape parade through New York - and both Gibson, 76, tennis's first black tennis star, and Ederle, pioneer English Channel swimmer, 98, retired to live out their lives in reclusive anonymity. Ninety-eight was a gallant marathon swim all right - but in grievous contrast in 2003 were the deaths of two international players cut off in their 20s before their talent had time to blaze across the skies with anything like the richest of fulfilment. Devastation is still being felt by many more than their team confr\u00e8res for the precociously gifted Nick Duncombe, Harlequins and England scrum-half, who died suddenly at 21 while training in Lanzarote, and for one of the shining lights of African football, Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9, 28, who collapsed during Cameroon's Confederations Cup semi-final in Lyon. Some stars burn twice as bright, they say, but for only half as long. Chris Brasher, Corinthian Olympic champion, enlightened entrepreneur and only begetter of the London Marathon, died of cancer at 74, as did the pathfinder sports agent Mark McCormack at 73. And Sir Paul Getty, probably Britain's most generous philanthropist (certainly cricket's) died of a chest infection at 70. In their totally different ways, those three left a fundamental legacy. While McCormack, for instance, cherished the price tag for sport, Getty cherished the values - as Matthew Engel wrote in these pages in April: \"Getty's love of cricket was not based on the kind of detail that absorbs most enthusiasts - he was not a great one for discussing the lbw law - but on what it represented; and his love of antique books was much the same.\" Button-bright celeb Sheene and Shoemaker were self-made bespoke originals. Son of a garage mechanic, Sheene at 15 was a delivery boy in a West End store when dad spannered up a bike for him for a novice race at Brands Hatch. First go, he fell off; second go, he smashed the lap record. By 20 in 1970, he was British 125cc champ; in 1976 and 1977 he was 500cc world champion and an engaging button-bright celeb with a courage and confidence as shiny as his name. Shoemaker also rode his first winner at 15, in 1949 - his last and 8,833rd in 1991. At 7st, he was always 20lbs lighter than his British counterpart Lester Piggott, while his 2-size boots and tiny legs - only 12 inches from the knees down - made inexplicable his featherlight balance and centric control of a careering thoroughbred. Both were party people who only narrowed their eyes for the day job, and it was invariably a pleasure to interview the gregarious Sheene and the succinct Shoemaker - one sentence from the latter was worth 50 stuttering mumbles from his midget confr\u00e8res: \"I don't whip 'em. I never force 'em. I just settle 'em down and that seems to make 'em run.\" Gibson survived a brutalised,impoverished Harlem childhood and the big otry of the all-white USLTA to win two Wimbledon and two US singles titles in the 50s and when she returned to London for the 1977 centenary parade of champions she smiled, shrugged, and told me: \"I guess I made it because I had a bit of talent, but mostly because I learned how to take my punishment all along the way.\" In contrast, the reason for Ederle's latter reclusion was the stone deafness caused by her distance swimming. The New York butcher's daughter had been briefly the toast of the world, an American probably more universally famous than Babe Ruth or Jack Dempsey, after her 14hr 31min crossing (swathed in mutton fat) from Cap Gris Nez to Deal in August 1926, not only the first woman to achieve the feat but smithereening, as well, the men's record by two hours. Her last public appearance, by all accounts, was at the Aquashow during the New York World Fair in 1939. After which she devoted the rest of her long life to teaching deaf children to swim. English football lost its most saintly eminence in November when Southampton's esteemed Ted Bates died at 85. The one-club man of utter grandeur. The following week they cleared the match pro gramme for tributes. \"Nicholson, Finney, Paisley, Lofthouse have deservedly won reputations for devotion to one club,\" wrote David Bull, \"but none can touch Ted's record of 66 years' continuous service, during which he held down eight different posts.\" To which Chris Nicholl (manager 1985-91) added: \"Ted knew more about football than anyone else to whom I've ever spoken - he could enlighten you, know-how and knowledge just seeped through his bones.\" Another copper-bottomed one-club stalwart had gone the month before when cancer finally took, at 54, Steve Death, Reading's legendary little big man between the sticks - only 5ft 6in his boots but 537 intrepid appearances over 12 years, including the (still) league record of 11 matches and 1,103 minutes without conceding a goal (and only then an og via his defender Stewart Henderson's knee) between March 24 and August 18 1979. Death's immortality. Half-nelsons In what must almost be a last drum-roll broadcasters from the golden age, three more handed back to the studio for ever in 2004 - horseracing's shrill megaphone maestro of the final furlong, Peter Bromley, 74 ; wrestling's smoochie ringside reader of half-nelsons and whole headlocks, Kent Walton, 86; and decorous all-round good companion at cricket, rugby, darts, anything, even dancing, Peter West, 83. Writers, too, inscribed The End for one concluding close-down - the ravishing radio playwright Peter Tinniswood, 66, who gave cricket its choleric and cranky Brigadier; George Plimpton, 76, eclectic humorist who unforgettably took left hooks from Archie Moore and ransackings from Detroit Lions linebackers to bring \"participatory journalism\" to sportswriting; the football writer Reg Drury, 75, as rich in probity as dry Cockney humour; and the popular, talented Robert Mills, 51, latest in the pantheon of sapiently sharp cricket writers of the Yorkshire Post, who had succeeded David Hopps when he joined these pages more than a dozen years ago. Not another ounce of iron to be pumped by Swansea's pride and joy, aka Mr Universe 1973, aka Paul Grant. To win his title 30 years ago (when he was 30), Paul had to beat Louis Ferrigno (Hollywood's original Incredible Hulk). Before returning with his wife Christine (Miss Universe Bikini) to Wales as a living and very large legend, Grant helped train his friend, the future governor of California, for the 1976 cult movie Pumping Iron (in which he co-starred with said Schwarzenegger). Although increasingly debilitated by a rare kidney disease requiring daily dialysis, Grant remained a paramount personality in his sport (he was a pro-active president of the Welsh Federation of Bodybuilders for a quarter of a century) and he was lifting weights almost to the last. And all the while he stuck to his rigid diet each day of four Weetabix with milk, five half-pints of egg-powder mix, a large steak, a whole chicken, a tub of non-fat ice cream, as well as, munched down by the handful, one Superplex multivitamin tablet, five choline bitartrate fat-fighters, 18 wheatgerm capsules, 100 brewer's yeast tablets and 500 Pro-Fit pills. His hobby was singing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
