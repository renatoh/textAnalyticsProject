Jeremy Trafford is an elegant 69-year-old academic and author from the right side of the tracks; Andrew Thomas, 20 years younger, is a former bus driver. They meet; they fall in love and decide to get hitched in one of the new civil partnerships introduced by London mayor Ken Livingstone. Both men have painful stories to tell about being in denial about their sexualities as younger men. Now they are forging a new life together, and this bold affirmation of love makes this a real feelgood movie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
