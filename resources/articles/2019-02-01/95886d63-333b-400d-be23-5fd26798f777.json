With 45 days to go until Britain is due by law to leave the EU, with or without a deal, the prime minister will address MPs about progress in the Brexit talks, No 10 announced on Monday. She is unlikely to signal any shift towards a closer future relationship with the EU, after writing to Jeremy Corbyn to underline her continued objections to a customs union, and instead she will focus on the backstop. \u201cWe are absolutely clear on this: we\u2019re not considering Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s customs proposals, we\u2019re not considering any proposals to remain in the customs union. We must have our own, independent trade policy,\u201d May\u2019s spokesman said on Monday. May will stress her continued focus on the backstop, but the EU\u2019s chief negotiator insisted on Monday there was no question of Brussels giving in to Downing Street\u2019s demands. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for clarity and movement from the United Kingdom,\u201d Barnier told reporters after talks in Luxembourg with the country\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel. At a dinner with Barnier in Brussels later on Monday, the UK\u2019s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, had been expected to echo May\u2019s calls for a time limit on the backstop, a unilateral exit mechanism or its replacement with an \u201calternative arrangement\u201d. But Barnier suggested beforehand that he would offer Barclay little succour. \u201cTonight I will repeat the EU\u2019s positions. I will listen to what the secretary of state has to tell us concerning the alternative arrangements which the UK would like,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not more than a concept today. I will also evaluate the interest from the UK side for possible changes to the political declaration, which, let me remind you, fixes the outline quite precisely for the future separation.\u201d Following the dinner, Barnier said there had been \u201cconstructive talks\u201d but reiterated the EU\u2019s refusal to renegotiate the Irish backstop. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from our side that we\u2019re not going to reopen the withdrawal agreement but we will continue our discussion in the coming days,\u201d he said. A spokesman for the UK government offered no indication of any progress, adding that the two sides had agreed to further talks and were still seeking to find \u201ca way forward\u201d. A commission official said the two sides had \u201cdiscussed the urgent need to find a solution that both respects the EU\u2019s guidelines, as well as one that is supported by a strong majority in the House of Commons. Further engagement is foreseen over the next week.\u201d Barclay will travel to Strasbourg on Tuesday to set out the UK\u2019s stance to MEPs, and the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, will take the same message to Paris. In Westminster, meanwhile, May is expected to confirm she will hold another Brexit vote in parliament on 27 February. Opponents of a no-deal Brexit inside her cabinet and on the Tory backbenches want to hear confirmation from the prime minister that any motion she tables then will be amendable. That would allow them to have another attempt at winning a majority for an amendment that could force the prime minister\u2019s hand, if she has not brought a reworked version of her deal back to parliament for MPs\u2019 approval before then. Yvette Cooper and Nick Boles, two senior backbenchers whose amendment against no deal failed to gain majority support last month, have not yet made a final decision about whether to table a reworked version or wait until 27 February, the Guardian understands. But they have been working on a revised version of their bill to extend article 50, which would then have to be tabled by mid-March to have a chance of being passed before exit day. Their amendment would set a final mid-March deadline for May to win a majority for her deal, obliging the government to make time for the bill if she has not secured parliament\u2019s support before then. May\u2019s hopes of cobbling together a majority were boosted on Monday as Boris Johnson said he would be willing to accept a deal with a time-limited backstop. The former foreign secretary told a meeting in parliament: \u201cI think it must be pretty obvious that if you are going to have a time limit to the backstop \u2013 and I think that would be very good \u2013 it has got to fall before the next election.\u201d Some more hardline Brexiters have suggested the backstop must be removed altogether from the withdrawal agreement, but that looks highly unlikely to win favour in Brussels. Downing Street hopes that if May can win round Johnson, she can split the hard-Brexit European Research Group (ERG). Together with a group of Labour backbenchers encouraged by promises of fresh guarantees on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards, May hopes she can win over enough MPs to pass her deal. Labour will table its own amendment this week seeking to put what the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, calls a \u201chard stop\u201d, on the government\u2019s negotiating time by enforcing a deadline by which May must bring a deal back to the Commons. May\u2019s insistence that she will not countenance joining a customs union was seized on by those MPs who want to see Labour embrace a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. They suggested it was now time for Corbyn to do so. It emerged on Monday that an earlier draft of Corbyn\u2019s letter to the prime minister last week, which was initially drawn up by Starmer, included a reference to a referendum, but it was removed during the editing process. Asked about the claim by journalists in Dublin on Monday, Starmer said: \u201cThe letter was an agreed letter that went out. We\u2019ve now got a response from the prime minister. The critical question is: is she, in her response, indicating a willingness to drop her red lines or not?\u201d In her letter to Corbyn, May argued that her own Brexit plan \u201cexplicitly provides for the benefits of a customs union\u201d in terms of avoiding tariffs, while allowing \u201cdevelopment of the UK\u2019s independent trade policy beyond our economic partnership with the EU\u201d. She wrote: \u201cI am not clear why you believe it would be preferable to seek a say in future EU trade deals rather than the ability to strike our own deals.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
