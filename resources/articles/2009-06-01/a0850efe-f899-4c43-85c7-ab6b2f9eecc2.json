Rather: what can't she do? So far she has escaped the Bible Belt hometown that inspired Footloose; turned teen entrepreneur while working in a mall bakery - operating a covert free-muffins-for-shoes scheme with the shop next door; and subverted society's prejudice to become a fashion and music icon (and we know how resistant those two professions can be to flamboyant homosexuals who look different). Likable and articulate, Ditto now occupies a similar place to Charming Man-era Morrissey: a journalist's delight whose media coverage is in inverse proportion to her hit tally. Standing in the Way of Control - or, at least, Soulwax's remix, which is what everyone knows - is always thrilling. But you can't help feeling the media's enthusiasm to rally round a 15-stone lesbian activist has gone rather pear-shaped itself. One magazine got high-fashion designers to make Ditto clothes. In the photos she is mostly naked, a feathery skirt barely covering her nethers. One designer label contributed a pair of earrings. Like she cares. \"It's my goal in life to not be a pretentious jerk,\" she has said, believably. But Ditto is in an odd position now. On the one hand: a self-proclaimed punk. On the other: best mates with Kate Moss, the recipient of free \u00a33,000 Mulberry handbags and signed to the world's largest music conglomerate. Perhaps conscious of this, Music For Men finds Ditto loudly (it's always loudly) reasserting her outsider credentials. \"If there's a risk, I'll take it!\"; \"I say what I mean!\"; \"You're so conventional, it's comical!\" The subject of Dimestore Diamond has a \"home-made haircut\" yet \"shines like the real thing\". Spare Me From the Mold is either a paean to individuality in American spelling, or a dance-punk advert for Mr Muscle. Rick Rubin produces; a mixed blessing. Regarded for Zen-like extraction of the central DNA from everyone from Danzig to Neil Diamond - mantra: \"Just be yourself\" - the Gossip's lean template of white-funk guitars and stentorian gender politics never sounded so pristine. By track 12, it feels a bit like being told off by the B-52's. Heavy Cross strives to repeat ... Control; 8th Wonder (\"with each other!\") is catchy enough but Love Long Distance's dippy disco recalls another extrovert with Arkansas roots and a penchant for performing in her pants: Cher. What can't Beth Ditto do? Clearing the bar set by ... Control and her super-sized media personality may prove the hurdle too far.
