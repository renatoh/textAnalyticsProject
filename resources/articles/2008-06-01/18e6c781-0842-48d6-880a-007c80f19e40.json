The actor-turned-teacher-turned-lecturer spends his university holidays setting up drama workshops for teenagers in some of the world's regions of conflict. It has taken him to the West Bank, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and South Africa. Four years ago, one Sunday morning, Oddie, a senior drama lecturer at the University College Plymouth St Mark and St John, was thinking about the state of the world. The west was still reeling from the tremors of September 11; racial tensions were higher than they had been for some time; Britain and the US were engaged in war in Iraq; and troops had just launched an attack on Falluja. \"I asked my students, 'what can I do, what can we do?',\" Oddie, 62, says. \"My answer was that I could create an arts project that would lead to a more peaceful world. I would develop a global network of young people, artists and educators who would share stories, build bridges and challenge prejudices,\" he says. \"And I would concentrate on working with young people in regions of conflict, helping them to reconcile their differences with one another.\" Resource for reconciliation Days later, Oddie came up with what he calls a \"naff\" name that stuck: Arrow, short for Art: a Resource for Reconciliation Over the World. Today, Arrow's drama workshops and theatre summer schools give marginalised teenagers in the Middle East, west Africa, South Africa and the Balkans one of the only tools they have: self-expression. And it's proving very powerful. In Beit Jala, on the West Bank, teenagers used to \"spend all their free time throwing stones in the street\", says Marina Barham, who runs Arrow under the auspices of her Al-Harah theatre. \"They were very judgmental of each other. Now they know what they want and theatre is very much a part of that,\" she says. In South Africa, Nasreen Rasool helps black and white teenagers come together. \"The project has provided a platform where [young people] can express themselves and learn more about one another and their different cultures,\" she says. \"They are moving away from the stereotypes. It's made them understand the commonality between them.\" Theatres have long had a magical impact in times of conflict, Oddie says. He cites the Dodona theatre in Kosovo which, at the height of war in 1992, was a hive of cultural activities and of community spirit. The theatre was considered one of the few spaces where people felt free to laugh or cry. \"Through the arts we can give form, expression and meaning to our stories, our fears and our aspirations,\" he says. \"We can acknowledge past pain and rehearse alternative futures. The arts have a unique contribution to make towards relationship-building. These teenagers are building their confidence in themselves and their peers, and raising their self-esteem.\" Arrow groups post photos of themselves on the project's website, art-peace.co.uk. Even those who are in conflict with each other share resources. Playwright and director Jeton Neziraj, who runs Arrow in Kosovo, is now accepted by the Albanian Arrow group and the Serbian one. Neziraj, an Albanian, has written a play, The Bridge, which both groups have performed. But Oddie knows he can only go so far. You might expect that a drama workshop that hopes to reconcile divisions in the Middle East or the Balkans would bring Palestinian and Israeli teenagers, and Serbian and Albanian ones, together. Sadly not yet. \"They aren't ready for that,\" Oddie says. In the Middle East, he says, he \"can't see a point next week or next year when they will be\". Barham told him, shortly after meeting him, that \"if you are trying to make us reconcile with Israel, we can't\". \"I would love to be able to say to Marina [Barham] that I have made contact with this theatre company in Tel Aviv supportive of the peace movement and ask if she would work with them. But I know that she would say no. And I am not going to say 'right, Arrow is going to work with someone else then'. We've built up trust. Who am I to say they should reconcile? When I first went to the West Bank, I was traumatised to see settlements bristling with wires and guns and to see the hideous wall worming its way into Bethlehem.\" The prospect of reconciliation in Kosovo is not so unthinkable. The Albanian teenagers and their Serbian peers know about each other, but won't work together yet. And on his last visit to Kosovo, Neziraj told Oddie about an Albanian woman who had been told by soldiers to pick which of her children was to be shot. Peace-building For Oddie, theatre workshops and the arts can do something for reconciliation and peace-building that politicians and policy-makers can't. \"Artists enable people to see their situation in a way they haven't before,\" he says. \"Politicians can negotiate a treaty, but that's useless if it's not accepted that the treaty is needed. \"It's the language of drama, with its metaphors, sounds and rhythms that does it. They give form to our deepest feelings and bring about change.\" Today Oddie will take this message to the House of Commons, where there will be a reception to drum up investors. The project is at a watershed. It wants to develop a permanent presence on the stage of global peace-building. Politicians have been falling over themselves to show support - four Plymouth MPs are attending today's event. What's needed now is cash. A \u00a390,000 grant from the Department for International Development (DfID) has run out and the project is mainly drawing on small grants of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a315,000 from unions and charities. Oddie uses his \u00a310,000 National Teaching Fellowship Award, given to him two years ago, to travel. \"How do we struggle to get a few thousand pounds when billions are spent on the arms trade?\" he asks. \"We have found it very difficult to break into the commercial area for sponsorship.\" When Oddie gets disheartened, he turns to one of his inspirations. They include Olaudah Equiano, whose story Oddie has developed and performed as a one-man show. Equiano, born in the 18th century, was the son of a village chief in what is now Nigeria. At 11 he became a slave. He worked on a plantation in Virginia and was bought by a British naval officer, only to be sold again in the West Indies, where he eventually won his freedom. Equiano married an English woman and became a tireless fighter for justice and the abolition of slavery. \"He never lost his determination, faith or humour,\" says Oddie. Another inspiration is Desmond Tutu. Tutu chairs the Truth and Reconciliation Committee, which hears the victims and perpetrators of human rights abuses. Tutu has described the committee as \"like a stage on which people tell their stories and really listen to each other\". For Oddie, this is exactly what Arrow is all about. Shortly after Arrow was formed, Oddie wrote to Tutu to ask for his blessing and support. To his surprise, Tutu wrote back that the concept was \"exciting, especially as it is so apt for the times\". In November 2006, the Desmond Tutu Centre opened at the college in Plymouth as Arrow's global centre. In the past 10 years, Oddie has drawn strength from Buddhism, which he sees as \"dealing with the world as it really is\" and less dogmatic than Judeo-Christianity. The Buddha seems to say, work with what you have directly experienced and look at how you can work with the core suffering that goes on now.\" This is exactly what Oddie - and Arrow - are striving to do.
