Snappli reckons it knows...", "bodyText": "What happens once iPhone and iPad users update to iOS 6 and try the Maps app? Do they stick with it, or do they decide - in line with chief executive Tim Cook's \"extremely sorry\" letter on Apple's site - that it isn't up to standard? Snappli, which makes a data-compression service for iPhone users (so in that sense rather like what RIM provides for users of its BlackBerry handsets) has been monitoring what has been happening over the past week since people began upgrading to iOS 6, and in particular with the change from offering Google data to Apple's own data. The graph is below: Eldar Tuvey of Snappli says the figures are as follows: \u2022 64% of our users in the past week are now on iOS 6 (UK and US) - in fact 16% upgraded to iOS on the first day \u2022 Before the upgrade to iOS6, 25% of our users were viewing Google maps at least once a day \u2022 Once they moved to iOS6, that immediately went to 35% of users using Apple Maps \u2022 However, over the next five days that drops down to 4% In summary, says Tuvey, \"Before iOS 6, one in four people were using Google Maps [daily]; after iOS 6, one in 25 are using Apple Maps daily, and that figure is falling\u2026.\" On its face, this is pretty damning: people aren't downloading any data through Apple Maps. So they can't be using it, surely? Except there's one confounding factor: Google's maps on iOS 5 use raster graphics; Apple's Maps on iOS 6 use vector graphics (the same format as Nokia, and as Google's Maps on Android). Raster, vector, data The key difference between raster and vector graphics is that raster graphics are a fixed-frame set - essentially, a picture - whereas vector graphics are files where the images they encode can be scaled up or down without requiring any extra data. There is a cost in terms of CPU to using vector graphics - but the big advantage is that you don't have to download any extra data once you have the tile. Let Wikipedia explain it: Vector graphics is the use of geometrical primitives such as points, lines, curves, and shapes or polygon(s), which are all based on mathematical expressions, to represent images in computer graphics. \"Vector\", in this context, implies more than a straight line. Vector graphics is based on images made up of vectors (also called paths, or strokes) which lead through locations called control points. Each of these points has a definite position on the x and y axes of the work plan. Each point, as well, is a variety of database, including the location of the point in the work space and the direction of the vector (which is what defines the direction of the track). Each track can be assigned a color, a shape, a thickness and also a fill. This does not affect the size of the files in a substantial way because all information resides in the structure; it describes how to draw the vector. The key difference is that Google Maps on iOS 5, because it uses raster graphics, needs repeated downloads. You'll see this if you load a page on maps.google.com in iOS 5, then turn the phone to Airplane mode - so the Wi-Fi and data connections are off - and then try to scroll off the page. You'll hit a blank spot because there isn't any data. By contrast, the vector graphics used in Apple Maps don't require extra downloads. You can confirm this by loading a page (choose your own location, for simplicity), and then turning the data connections off. Now try scrolling across the page: it will load. You'll be able to see detail in your surrounding area. You'll be able to zoom in and out. If you're in a car or train, you should find that you can track your travel - even plan your route, to some extent - with zero extra data. The whole of the UK is encapsulated in less than 200MB, according to data from CoPilot. Korea factor That was certainly my experience earlier this week in Korea, where on a visit to Samsung I had an iPhone running iOS 6 which had no data contract. One evening I looked at the overview of North and South Korea (it turns out Apple's Maps offer more detail than Google does for North Korea; the latter's is just a white blank). The next day, with zero data coverage, we were taken on a coach trip to a Samsung production facility. The phone tracked our entire journey, with street-level data including the names of shops, all the way. And all the way back. And then, later, out to the airport. All that, without getting a single extra drop of data. The day starts in Seoul, on a bus. I took more than 100 screenshots during this trip with zooms at all sorts of levels of detail. This is only the tiniest, illustrative selection. We then head south. But let's zoom in to see the road detail. And zoom out again. The bottom edge of the screen hasn't refilled - but it does after a moment. A zoom in just to check where we are. Again, this is all done by the vector data that came with the original download the night before. ..and back again.. ..until we reach Seoul. The time lapse between some of the screenshots is due to the visit paid to Samsung's memory factory. There weren't any data sources there. Bottom line: vector mapping is powerful. So while there's absolutely no reason to doubt that Snappli is correct in what it shows about the amount of data being downloaded by iOS 6 users, it might be worth pondering whether that's actually representative of time spent on maps. That's likely to stay much the same. For one thing, if people use maps a lot - as the figures seem to suggest they do - it's odd if they go from using them a lot (iOS 5) to using them a lot (iOS 6 first install) and then not using them at all (as the graph implies). If Apple Maps is so unbelievably terrible, wouldn't you expect to see an uptick in the graph in the use of Google maps data again (since Snappli can see where the data demand is coming from)? Yes, you would. Personally - I'll repeat, since people seem to think I'm making this up - I have found Apple's maps to be fine. I haven't been horrified by the lack of detail compared to Google Maps. Certainly, they're sparse - but the ability (at last) to turn the map around, tilt it in 3D, and especially navigate to locations using voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation - particularly when you add the ability to get Siri to set up the navigation without having to take the phone out of your pocket (wearing a mic and headset, or Bluetooth earpiece/mic) - means, I think, you have something far, far better than what preceded it. I've personally used it multiple times and been very satisfied by it. Imagine: two weeks ago, if you used an iPhone you'd have to look at your screen to get turn-by-turn (with no voice guidance); you couldn't set it up via Siri; you'd have to hope your data connection was good as you moved around the country or city. (Of that, there's no guarantee.) Yes, you did have transit data built into Google Maps. (You now, if you try to use the public transport option in routing with Maps, get pointed to apps in the App Store to plan the route. Great for app developers.) By contrast, what the iPhone has now in terms of functionality (if not uniform data quality) finally matches what Android and Nokia have had for some time. Vector graphics change the game compared to raster graphics; and turn-by-turn, enormously important in Apple's main market of the US (because so much time is spent driving). Google and Apple couldn't agree on terms for Google to license either element; Google wanted more branding in the app, and to use its Latitude user-tracking service in the app. Apple resisted both and built up its mapping expertise. Clearly, there's a lot of anger out there about Apple's Maps. (There's a lot of schadenfreude too, I think.) Apple didn't get it right, by a long chalk; Tim Cook acknowledged that. But Apple equally didn't feel it could leave mapping to someone else. Personally, I haven't been let down by Apple's Maps. In the brief time I had to test them while reviewing the iPhone 5, they seemed - as I said at the time - good. And miles better in many regards than what preceded them (shall I repeat? Voice navigation inegrated with Siri, vector mapping). Clearly, their quality varies enormously for different people in different places. In Ontario, for example, the quality in place names looks dire. In the UK, by contrast, the Ordnance Survey gazetteer has 250,000 place names and details - and is free, open data. (Remember a campaign for free map data in the UK?) Possibly that has helped; and the fact that Canada doesn't have the same regime may have made it harder there. The US also has enormously variable data quality at the local and national level, whereas the Ordnance Survey is world-renowned for the quality of its work. Let's hear it for free data, then. (Criticisms of the satellite pictures - many gathered on Amazing iOS 6 Maps - seem by-the-by. If you really use satellite pictures to navigate, you're either an astronaut or a pilot, and in either case shouldn't be using an iPhone.) All fields? The reality though is that Apple still has a problem on its hands - which Tim Cook has acknowledged. But equally, even while it is conceding at least seven years' experience of offering public maps to Google, it is a company that has a lot of resources - not least those billions in the bank. People might not be pleased with Apple's maps right now. But it's going to be fascinating to see where it is in a year's time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
