The rebuff follows a ruling earlier today in which the supreme court refused to order the reinsertion of a feeding tube in Ms Schiavo, who is at the centre of a right-to-die case. Mr Bush's request cited new allegations of neglect and challenged the diagnoses that Ms Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state, but Pinellas Circuit Judge George Greer wasn't convinced. The decisions reduce the chances for quick intervention to reconnect the tube, which was pulled out last Friday. Doctors have said Ms Schiavo, 41, would be likely to die in a week or two without nourishment. Ms Schiavo's husband, Michael, had urged the high court on Thursday not to intervene, saying her case has been endlessly litigated and state courts have agreed with him that she would want to die. The appeal by her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, was part of a rush of legal activity in the unprecedented right-to-die struggle. They have frantically tried to reconnect the tube because they deny Mr Schiavo's arguments that she has no hope for recovery and that she would not have wanted to live in such a state. The supreme court's terse one-page order did not explain its decision but experts had earlier said it was unlikely the court would get involved after numerous lower courts had ruled against the parents. It was at least the fifth time the court has declined to get involved in the Schiavo case. In the emergency submission to the supreme court earlier today, Mr and Mrs Schindler said their daughter faced an unjust and imminent death based on a decision by her husband to remove a feeding tube without strong proof of her consent. They alleged constitutional violations of due process and religious freedom. The filing also argued the US Congress intended for Ms Schiavo's tube to be reinserted, at least temporarily, when it passed an extraordinary bill last weekend that gave federal courts the authority to review her case fully. \"This case has attracted worldwide attention - including that of the ... Congress, the president and the political branches of the state of Florida,\" the Schindlers' attorneys wrote. \"Just as in a capital punishment case, Terri's life hangs in the balance and could well be over within hours of this court's decision.\" The Schindlers' appeal went first to Justice Anthony Kennedy, an appointee of Ronald Reagan who has staked a moderate position on social issues. He referred the case to the full nine-member court. The court's decision was not surprising. Not only had justices repeatedly declined to intervene in the Schiavo case on prior occasions, but they routinely defer to state courts on family law issues. The Bush administration yesterday said it could do no more to save Ms Schiavo, who has been in a vegetative state since collapsing at home in 1990. At the weekend, after emergency sessions on Capitol Hill, President Bush emerged from his bedroom in his pyjamas early on Monday to sign into law a bill sending the case for federal court review. After a court hearing in Tampa, Florida, on Monday, a federal judge on Tuesday said the woman's parents had not established a \"substantial likelihood of success\" if the feeding tube were reinserted and refused to order the procedure. That decision was upheld yesterday by an appeal court, although one of the three judges backed the parents, ruling their daughter's \"imminent\" death would end the case before it could be fully considered. \"In fact, I fail to see any harm in reinserting the feeding tube,\" Judge Charles Wilson wrote. Doctors say Ms Schiavo is likely to die of dehydration within two weeks without her feeding tube. On Tuesday, her parents said she was \"fading quickly\" and might die at any moment. The Florida state courts have already ruled, based on the evidence, that Ms Schiavo would want to die. The decision by the White House yesterday to distance itself from the dispute was seen as an acknowledgement that Mr Bush's previous intervention in the affair had raised concerns among fellow conservatives opposed to blurring the lines between the executive and the judiciary. Ms Schiavo's feeding tube has been removed twice before, the last time in October 2003, when it was reinserted after six days following an order from Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida and the president's brother. Ms Schiavo appeared to suffer little harm then, but a forensic pathologist, Michael Baden, said her body was likely to have been damaged this time after six days without sustenance. \"There comes a point when other body organs will suffer from dehydration, the most important one being the heart,\" Dr Baden said. \"Eventually her heart will stop and she will die.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
