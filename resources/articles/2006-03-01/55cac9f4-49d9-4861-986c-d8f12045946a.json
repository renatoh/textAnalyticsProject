Kevin Blackwell looked mightily pleased with a point, especially after the news from Norwich. The time was right for the manager to dig out an old line: \"They say it's not how you start, it's how you finish.\" There was a chilling remorselessness to Leeds's second-half play, most appropriate on a day when the wind-buffeted Ricoh Arena became a new candidate for coldest football venue in the land. A calmly converted penalty by David Healy after much Coventry complaint two minutes from time sent the visiting hordes home with a glowing feeling. Leeds can be well satisfied with a draw because it was extracted from one of the Championship's most improved teams, one that will help shape the play-off competition even if they do not reach the top six themselves. For Leeds, there is no rest in the pursuit of second place: they entertain Crystal Palace tomorrow night with the incentive of reducing the gap to a solitary point. \"It's now started to get very close,\" said Blackwell with lovely understatement. \"We were 17 points adrift and we've kept chipping away.\" His team's consistency, he claimed, was all the more praiseworthy given that \"the pressure on this club is much greater than at others. They all get motivated by playing Leeds. Finding the players to cope with that is part of the secret.\" There is no secret to Leeds's rise, says Micky Adams: \"With the quality of their players - they've got an array of talent - they're going to force you back.\" It was an honest explanation of why his Coventry team could not maintain their first-half control, highlighted by a deft finish by Gary McSheffrey to an imaginative build-up involving Stern John and Dele Adebola. Adams shrugged aside a pre-match barb by the visiting captain Paul Butler that Coventry's manager, a Sheffield United fan, would rather see them promoted than Leeds. Adams has divided loyalties all round - he is a former Leeds player and proud of that association - but he did not even bother to remind Butler that his current club badly damaged United the previous weekend. Blackwell had no grudge at all: \"Micky is a Blade - everyone's got a soft spot for a team.\" Adams hopes that Coventry will be the Leeds of next season. There are several parallels. \"The new regime has been very positive, trying to open up revenue streams,\" he said. \"The club has had five to six managers in the past few years. The morale now is good - everyone in the city is talking about the club.\" So far, Adams's budget has scarcely matched Blackwell's. \"I've spent about \u00a320,000 since I became a manager here,\" Adams said. \"I've had about 10 free transfers. If I'd had the resources that Kevin has had, I hope I would have made as good a choice.\" There was a good balance to this game. Don Hutchison and Rob Hulse hit the crossbar, and McSheffrey's wasteful shot after a superb run was matched by a poor Robbie Blake header. Any perceived home injustice at Clive Oliver's penalty award over Andrew Whing's point-blank handling of Eddie Lewis's cross must be seen in the context of Leeds's domination of the second period. After a long delay, Healy made the most of the opportunity provided by the American winger.
