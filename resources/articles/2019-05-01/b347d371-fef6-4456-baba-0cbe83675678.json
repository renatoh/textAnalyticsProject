It took him four hours to fill this giant scroll with grotesquely vivacious portraits of ghosts and demons. These fascinating monsters are a rare highlight of the British Museum\u2019s blockbuster journey into Japan\u2019s art. Ky\u014dsai was the Jackson Pollock of caricature, turning actors in Tokyo\u2019s kabuki theatre into these uncanny yet very real beings. His freely painted panorama of the supernatural shows exactly why European artists in the late 19th century looked to Japan for inspiration. Ky\u014dsai still looks like our contemporary. Even though his Shintomiza Theatre Curtain is now so fragile this may be the last time it is ever loaned to an exhibition, its rollicking energy and hilarity burst off the wall as if you were watching a film full of special effects and outlandish superheroes. For Japanese art looked like modern comics long before there were modern comics or movies based on them. You think Thanos is scary? Take a look at Tsukioka Yoshitoshi\u2019s 1880s drawing of a mythic warrior swinging his enemy\u2019s severed head around by its hair while he contorts his face into a snarling ecstasy of rage. Manga can be translated as \u201cpictures run riot\u201d and that is a beautiful description of these late 19th-century masterpieces. The trouble is that, on the evidence of this very odd exhibition, a lot of the riotousness has gone out of Japan\u2019s graphic art since the 1880s. Today\u2019s manga comics may be hugely popular in Japan and have a growing worldwide fanbase, but, as art, they don\u2019t come near the verve and audacity of Ky\u014dsai or Yoshitoshi. Next to Yoshitoshi the curators display Inoue Takehiko\u2019s manga series Vagabond, a martial arts adventure story about a swordsman called Miyamoto Musashi. We\u2019re supposed to see a connection \u2013 and a curator who showed me round presented it as a comparison of equals \u2013 but, artistically, the images from Vagabond are internationalised and all too familiar. The hero looks like a Jedi knight and, with their slick style, these could easily be production drawings for the next Star Wars film. The story manga tells just doesn\u2019t seem to be the one it thinks it\u2019s telling. We are shown a few masterpieces of Japan\u2019s superb artistic tradition and asked to see them as predecessors of today\u2019s comic-strip scene, which is presented in a highly reverential and patronising way. We\u2019re introduced to manga artists who speak on video about their work and given a thorough briefing about the details of manga, from the fact that you read it from right to left to the factory-like nature of its production. A lot of stress is placed on worthy political and moral values. The contemporary comics chosen for display celebrate an awful lot of admirable themes, from the current hit Golden Kamuy, which foregrounds Japan\u2019s minority culture the Ainu, to a comic looking forward to the Tokyo Paralympics. The section on sexuality stresses comics with a hearteningly inclusive message. Look deep in the catalogue and you\u2019ll find depictions of bondage, which are juxtaposed with the traditional Japanese erotic prints called Shunga. So manga is not as clean as it looks from this exhibition, and the museum is not being entirely honest, in its desperation to create a mass culture blockbuster for all ages and attention spans. I\u2019ve rarely seen a show whose catalogue is so much more interesting than the display in the gallery. Not only are the drawings in the book dirtier, but there are far more illustrations of classic Japanese art. Surely this is what the exhibition should have been. It should have used the contemporary allure of manga to draw us into a huge survey of Japan\u2019s art history. Instead, it expects us to seriously accept that manga\u2019s big-eyed heroes and their (on this evidence) sentimental adventures are themselves as worthy of attention as a work by Hokusai. What\u2019s next: Rembrandt meets Dennis the Menace? This exhibition occupies the British Museum\u2019s biggest exhibition gallery, the purpose-built space where it has previously shown colossal Egyptian statues and the sinister splendours of Assyrian palaces. How can you fill that space with comics? It turns out you can\u2019t. There are pages isolated on huge walls in painted splattery bubbles, display boards showing more comics, and blown-up scenes hanging as banners. It looks drab and silly. The fact that Manga uses black and white doesn\u2019t help. An inflatable head from the comic Attack on Titan seems sad by itself, as if it got lost here while all its companions headed for a theme park. If you are going to pander like this, you need to really go for it. The V&amp;A has turned exploiting the lowest common denominator into an art form with its ecstatic celebrations of style and music icons. It\u2019s probably to the British Museum\u2019s credit that it seems so uncomfortable in this pursuit of pop glory. This exhibition may prove too fussy for real manga fans, but could appeal to their parents, who can quickly learn some of the basics of the genre. It\u2019s constantly deferring to what it thinks are the rules of the big mass culture out there. Do we really need the section on costumers who love to dress as manga characters? I\u2019m not knocking manga or its fans, but what has it got to do with the British Museum? We go there to have our eyes opened to artistic and historical wonders, not to get more of what\u2019s on offer everywhere, 24/7. This exhibition is a tragicomic abandonment of a great museum\u2019s purpose. \u2022 Manga is at the British Museum, London, 23 May to 26 August"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
