The west's leading thinktank - which involves the world's 30 richest nations - said that only half of its members have made progress over the past decade in converging with the living standards of the United States, which it holds as the benchmark country. \"Relatively low income per capita and failure to converge on the highest-income countries can therefore be signs of policies not being as growth-friendly as they could be,\" the OECD's Going for Growth 2007 report said. Following years of sluggish economic growth, a number of the world's most advanced countries are beginning to see strong expansion. But the OECD warned that the global buoyancy must not lead to complacency and governments need to step up the pace of policy reform in order for solid growth to continue. \"Governments should resist the temptation to ease up on reforms aimed at boosting productivity and creating more jobs,\" said Jean-Philippe Cotis, OECD's chief economist. The income gap which persists between many European countries and the USA, the study said, was due to weak labour force participation in many member states, which reflected short working hours and high unemployment. Mr Cotis said that countries needed to focus on raising skill levels by strengthening higher-education to improve graduation rates and therefore boosting the low employment rates of unskilled workers. High unemployment in Europe has fallen back in recent years but still remains above levels in the US and UK. Low labour productivity was another driving factor in countries like Switzerland and Japan not achieving their growth potential, the report said. This was a problem that the UK suffered from, the OECD said. To target this, the report said the UK should focus on improving transportation to increase labour mobility and supported a national road pricing scheme. On a European level, the OECD recommended that countries rebalance their national income away from business profits and into higher salaries. This along with better job creation would raise living standards and lead to higher, more sustainable growth, they said. \"Reform is perceived, often wrongly so, as a threat to social cohesion and deeply held values. Our research shows that this need not be the case,\" said Mr Cotis. \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
