Batshuayi, a \u00a333.2m summer signing from Marseille, is poised to deputise for the suspended Diego Costa following the striker\u2019s fifth caution of the season, after 11 cardless appearances, at Crystal Palace on Saturday. Antonio Conte could still opt to utilise Eden Hazard in a central role, flanked by Pedro Rodr\u00edguez and Willian but the chance to offer Batshuayi his first league start is expected to sway his decision. The forward, prolific in Ligue 1 last season and a scorer at Watford in August, has made only 13 appearances for the London club to date this campaign, with his three starts all in the EFL Cup. He scored a double in a 3-2 win against Bristol Rovers in the second round. Yet those are his most recent goals and, with the player reduced to a bit-part role, West Ham United have indicated a desire to take the 23-year-old on a six\u2011month loan in January. That inquiry will be knocked back with Conte convinced Batshuayi will benefit more from working with the Chelsea squad at Cobham and conscious that the Belgian is his only senior alternative to Costa up front. The Brazil-born Spain international has been prolific this term, his winner at Palace made him the Premier League\u2019s top scorer with 13 goals, and has improved his on-field discipline markedly leaving Batshuayi having to stay on the sidelines. Yet Costa was substituted at Selhurst Park complaining of tightness in his hamstring and, while that should not prevent him from featuring against Stoke City on New Year\u2019s Eve, it was a reminder that niggling injuries may play a part in the remainder of the season. \u201cThis game was the third game in seven days, and Diego played all the games, with great intensity, passion and drive,\u201d said Conte after the 1-0 win. \u201cThe injury is nothing important. Now he has more days to rest compared to his team-mates.\u201d The striker has taken advantage of the squad being granted three days off this week to return to Brazil. Hazard is still undergoing treatment on the knee injury sustained from a kick he received against West Bromwich Albion earlier this month. While there has been frustration at limited opportunities, Batshuayi\u2019s commitment in training has never wavered, and his attitude has impressed Conte\u2019s coaching staff despite being restricted to occasional cameos from the bench and appearances for the club\u2019s Under-23s, for whom he has scored twice. Chelsea consider him a key player for the future who has the pedigree to make his mark this season if required. Batshuayi is not the only Chelsea player to have interested West Ham of late. The leaders\u2019 back-up goalkeeper, Asmir Begovic, has been targeted and there could be a loan offer submitted for the young the midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Conte intends to hold talks to the technical director, Michael Emenalo, and the player before determining whether he should seek to gain first-team experience away from Stamford Bridge over the second half of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
