In an interview with the Observer Miliband says Cameron has \"one last chance to show leadership\" and back the proposal by Lord Justice Leveson for a new independent system of regulation backed by statute. If he cannot be persuaded, Miliband says Labour will commit its energies to rallying support for a Commons vote in January that could see the prime minister defeated by an alliance of Labour, Liberal Democrats and Tory rebels. Cameron, under pressure to take action in the wake of Leveson's report is on Tuesday expected to urge editors they must act swiftly to set up an independent press watchdog. Miliband said he would not allow the prime minister, who told the Commons last Thursday that he was instinctively against legislating on issues of press freedom, to try to stall on such an important matter in order to curry favour with newspaper editors and owners who opposed a new law. \"I think there is huge urgency,\" the Labour leader said. \"We're not going to let these talks become a smokescreen for inaction and just be used as a way to run this into the ground, hoping people forget all about it, and hoping the fuss dies down. So in the next two to three weeks we have got to have a resolution. Are we going to ahead with legislation? If we can't reach agreement on that then we will put a vote to parliament. If the cross-party talks have nowhere to go and we can't reach agreement we have to go to parliament.\" Cross-party talks on a way forward began last Thursday after Lord Justice Leveson delivered his findings. Cameron's rejection of the a key element of the plan incensed victims of phone hacking who refused to meet the culture secretary on Friday in protest. In the interview, Miliband said he had reservations about how elements of Leveson's plans might hinder investigative journalism and day-to-day relations between reporters and their sources, including politicians and the police. But on the need for statutory backing to ensure an independent press regulation system that could deliver proper redress to those wronged by newspapers, he was uncompromising. Miliband praised Nick Clegg and Tory MPs who defied their leader. Cameron, he said, had showed a lack of leadership thus far but had three weeks to change his mind. \"He promised that the victims' voices would be paramount but now he has betrayed that promise by rejecting the report before the ink was dry. He needs to realise that if he continues on the course he has set \u2013 having pretty much rejected the judge's recommendations \u2013 he faces the prospect of trying to defy the will of the people expressed through parliament, too, if it votes to implement these recommendations. It is not leadership to do as you are told by a powerful lobby. David Cameron has one last chance to stand up for the victims and show the leadership needed \u2013 which he has conspicuously failed to show so far.\" A petition calling for the UK's three main party leaders to back the Leveson plan in its entirety has attracted more than 56,000 signatures since yesterday. Gerry McCann, father of missing Madeleine, and Christopher Jefferies, the landlord wrongly arrested for the murder of Joanna Yeates, urged the public to back their online campaign after Cameron indicated he planned to spike recommendations for legislation. Jefferies told the Observer he could not understand how Cameron could tell the country he would accept the proposals if they were not \"bonkers\" and then attempt to \"pick and choose\". He said: \"David Cameron used my name in the House of Commons. I call on Cameron to support Leveson's recommendations in full \u2026 There is nothing bonkers in any of Leveson's recommendations, the entire document appears to be entirely reasonable, moderate and proportionate. Cameron should be true to his word and support independent self-regulation of the press with statutory underpinning.\"David Hass, the spokesman for the Hacked Off organisation, representing victims of press abuses and calling for statutory reform, said that his organisation would be making it certain this week \"that the voices of the victims of press intrusion and the views of the public are heard\". He said: \"We now know that 80% of the public want to see an independent authority regulating the press and underpinned by statute and all the indications so far are that Labour party and the Lib Dems are determined to see the recommendations in Leveson's report carried out,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
