A month ago, it was beach-babe photos from Hawaii, good for a few walking-on-water jokes over the holidays. A week ago, it was more than 15,000 people in Springfield, standing outside in snow and ice to witness his formal announcement. Now Barack Obama's team is all Iowa and New Hampshire, serious plans and serious challenges to other candidates. They're from Chicago, where politics ain't beanbag and Obama ain't Obambi. Last Saturday, the talk of supporters, riding on a bus from just outside Chicago to Springfield, focused on their candidate's unique qualities and experience. The stark contrast with President Bush wasn't overtly stated but was very much present. Obama's judgement about the \"rash\" and \"dumb\" Iraq war in his 2002 speech, months before the invasion. His concern about the balance of powers, buttressed by ten years of teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago. His understanding of Americans left behind, from his days as a community organiser. His ability to unite disparate factions as the elected President of the Harvard Law Review. His personal global perspective, based on confidence and optimism rather than ignorance, fear or contempt. If a somewhat unusual preparation for president, the consensus was that it fit the current job description. Riding back, and in the supporter meetings taking place over the next few days, the talk was of fundraising, canvassing, spreading the word. What worked in his Senate campaign, what could be done differently. The new Obama website appeared, all Web 2.0 and social networking, reflecting but not defining the new generation of supporters. This base wants to attract friends, and everyone's a potential friend. No sign of any interest in using wedge issues to \"energise the base\" by making enemies. Karl Rove would be shaking his head, but this isn't about divide and conquer. As the man says, no red states, no blue states, just United States. E pluribus unum. I wonder about the X4X groups. Last time around, it seemed every possible special-interest group had a separate supporter group: Middle-Aged Single Carpenters in the Suburbs of Cincinnati for Whatsisname. Don't waste time talking to people who aren't exactly like you. Early days, but right now the interest seems to be in working together, sharing expertise, getting a different viewpoint. If that holds, it may be supporting evidence for Obama's pairing of \"our famous individualism\" with the belief that \"we're all connected as one people.\" Elsewhere, the trust gap is huge. The testimony in Scooter Libby's federal perjury trial has wound up, with neither Libby nor Cheney called to the stand. The public isn't surprised, but the public isn't pleased. Hillary Clinton says, \"I'm in it to win\"; they hear \"It's all about me.\" She says she wants a conversation; they hear echoes of Bush's \"consulting with our allies\". There's no shortage of contenders to be president, some knowing it's their last shot and desperate to win. No shortage of apparently convenient changes of previous bedrock belief. President Bush has a press conference about Iraq and Iran, and the questions of the journalists reflect their doubt. He tries to joke and lighten things up, but his efforts fall flat. Everyone's been burned. The line between scepticism and cynicism is a very blurry ash-grey. Yet, even with all that, even after all that, the American belief in the power of hope, optimism and leadership unaccountably remains. Obama didn't invent the audacity of hope, he just reminded everyone of it. They want to follow someone who tells them they can do better. They want to be inspired to be the best they can be. They want to bend that arc of history towards justice. And while, in my head, I hear the late Hugo Young warning, \"Put not your trust in princes,\" I can't help but wish he could have met Barack."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
