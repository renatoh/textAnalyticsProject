Nilsson, who was appointed manager only in October having taken over as caretaker following the sacking of Gordon Strachan, and Smith, who has been at the club only four months, paid the price for Coventry's dismal recent form, which cost them a place in the First Division play-offs. The chairman Mike McGinnity and the chief executive Graham Hover made the decision after a meeting with the coaches yesterday, claiming the club's performances this season have been \"totally unacceptable\". \"We understand the fans' frustration completely in addition to the need for immediate change,\" said McGinnity. But the former chairman Bryan Richardson last night claimed that the pair were sacked out of spite, because they were his appointments. \"I'm appalled by the decision but I'm not surprised,\" he said. \"There's absolutely no question at all why they've been sacked. It's not because of results but because of who gave them the jobs in the first place.\" Richardson was ousted in January, when the board lost patience with a regime that had run up \u00a330m in debts while failing to keep Coventry in the Premiership. Nilsson's sacking will not help. The 38-year-old Swede will receive a hefty pay-off, as he had two more years left on his contract. Nilsson was appointed manager on the strength of his achievement as caretaker. It was the Swedish international defender's first managerial job, but he appeared at first to have a gift for it, taking City on a 12-game unbeaten run before the decline set in. Only one point has been taken from the past six games. \"I'm more disappointed for Roland than myself and I think he has been very harshly treated,\" said Smith. \"He worked very hard but was not given the ammunition to do the job properly.\" Smith said that the move was not entirely unexpected, but Nilsson and others at the club were taken by surprise. \"It has come completely out of the blue,\" Nilsson said. Steve Froggatt, the former England winger, called it a \"complete shock\" and suggested that some other factor was involved in the board's decision.\"I was at the awards dinner three nights ago and everything seemed OK,\" he said, \"so something has happened since.\" Trevor Peake, the reserve-team coach and former Coventry defender, and Steve Ogrizovic, a coach and former goalkeeper, will take charge of the side for their final game of the season at Burnley on Sunday. McAllister is favoured to take over once his Liverpool contract expires this summer. The former Walsall manager Ray Graydon is also expected to be in the running. McAllister enjoyed four productive seasons at Highfield Road between 1996 and 2000, making 119 league appearances and scoring 20 goals before he joined Liverpool under the Bosman ruling. He was instrumental in helping G\u00e9rard Houllier's side claim three cups last year, but has played only minor roles this season. Though he remains a regular on the substitutes' bench and hugely popular on the Kop, the 37-year-old Scot has started only two games since December. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
