The Home Office took the case to the law lords after the high court and court of appeal ruled that control orders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 were too restrictive and breached the suspects' right to liberty. Nine men placed under control orders will also ask the law lords to declare that the controversial system, under which judges confirm orders after looking at \"closed\" intelligence material concealed from the suspect, is incompatible with the right to a fair trial. Control orders, with restrictions including curfews of up to 18 hours and bans on internet access and unauthorised visitors, were introduced in 2005 after the law lords ruled indefinite detention without charge for foreign terror suspects in Belmarsh prison, London, breached their human rights. Yesterday Ian Burnett QC, representing the home secretary, told the five judges: \"In the closing years of the 20th Century violent al-Qaida terrorism proliferated throughout the world.\" It was in the wake of this that the anti-terrorism laws were drawn up. \"The first duty of government is to protect its citizens from attack. The courts have recognised the heavy burden on the executive ...control orders are one means by which the danger of terrorism is reduced.\" Among those whose cases are under appeal are six Iraqis whose control orders were found to breach article 5 of the European convention on human rights, the right to liberty. One of them, Bestun Salim, vanished before police could issue him with a replacement order and is still at large. Another, who has not been named, disappeared on June 16 after 18 months on an order. In the second plank of the case, the challenge to the system of largely secret hearings, lawyers for the suspects will argue that no one can have a fair trial unless he knows the case against him. In the case of MB, a British citizen who former home secretary John Reid believed was planning to travel to Iraq to fight the coalition forces, Mr Justice Sullivan ruled in April 2006 that the process was \"conspicuously unfair\", with a \"thin veneer of legality.\" But his ruling was overturned by the court of appeal last August. The lords hearing is expected to last six days, with judgment reserved until the autumn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
