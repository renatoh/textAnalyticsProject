But the SANZAR unions have shied away from adopting the most contentious of the variations, including players on their feet being able to play the ball in a ruck with their hands, legalising maul collapsing and ending the numbers rule in the lineout. The changes taken on include backlines having to stand five metres behind the feet of their No8 at a scrum and only offside and foul play offences meriting a kick at goal. Next summer's tours by European countries to the southern hemisphere will see the current laws apply."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
