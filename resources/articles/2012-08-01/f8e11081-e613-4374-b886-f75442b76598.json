The regime comprises new rules for fundraisers, developed by the Public Fundraising Regulatory Association, and a penalty points and fines process for fundraising organisations that transgress the rules. The new chief executive of the Public Fundraising Regulatory Association, Sally de la Bedoyere said it is \"vitally important that fundraisers work to the highest possible standards in order to maintain the confidence of the public, media, and central and local government. These new rules complement the Institute of Fundraising's code of practice on face-to-face fundraising, which sets the benchmarks for best practice across all forms of fundraising. This is a prime example of how sector bodies can co-operate to drive up standards and improve compliance with the codes.\" The PFRA's rules for street fundraisers \u2013 contained in the PFRA Rule Book (Street F2F) \u2013 were developed following a request from the Institute of Fundraising to provide extra guidance to the Institute's code of practice on face-to-face fundraising. For instance, while the code of practice says only that fundraisers must never \"deliberately confuse or obstruct the public\", the Rule Book defines obstruction as: \"Any deliberate action that causes a person to involuntarily stop or suddenly change direction in order to get past the fundraiser and continue their journey.\" Ceri Edwards, director of policy and communications at the Institute of Fundraising, says: \"Every contribution to raising professional standards in fundraising is welcome and we look forward to working with the PFRA to make sure face-to-face fundraising remains a sustainable long-term option for charity fundraisers.\" The rule book contains a series of best practice rules that enhance the Institute of Fundraising's code of practice on face-to-face activity and provide extra guidance on interpreting the IoF's rules. For example, we introduced the three-step rule, intended to stop fundraisers following members of the public, and produced guidance on 'obstruction' and 'immediate termination' \u2013 two terms left undefined in the code of practice. Both the rule book and the penalty points system were announced in August 2011 and have been on trial since then. PFRA conducted a full review after six months. A full version of the rule can be read here . Key points The rule book contains a series of rules which carry penalty points of 20, 50 or 100 points, which are awarded against a fundraising organisation \u2013 whether they are agencies or charities running in-house teams \u2013 each time they breach one of these rules. When a fundraising organisation's points tally exceeds 1,000 points, that total is converted to a monetary fine on the basis of \u00a31 per point. Further breaches are invoiced, at \u00a31 per point each month. The slate is wiped clean for each fundraising organisation at the end of the financial year, when the 1,000-point threshold is reintroduced. All money levied though the fines system will be ring-fenced for improving PFRA's compliance function.

All money levied though the fines system will be ring-fenced for improving PFRA's compliance function. New rules \u2022 A new rule (C10) stipulates that fundraisers must make the solicitation statement, which is legally-required under s67 of the Charities Act 2006. The penalty for failure to make the legally- required disclosure is 100 points. \u2022 A further rule stipulates that before fundraising organisations embark on a campaign they ought to submit their proposed solicitation statement to the PFRA so it can check its compliance with the law (rule O1; penalty 100 points). \u2022 Fundraisers should not approach members of the public who are 'on duty' (C6; 20 points), such as newspaper vendors or tour guides, nor members of the public who are seated (C7; 20 points). \u2022 Fundraisers should not stand within 3 metres of a shop doorway, pedestrian crossing, cashpoint or station entrance (C8; 50 points). The previous version of the rule book only prohibited fundraisers from standing within 3 metres of a cashpoint. \u2022 Bags should not be left unattended on a public highway (C9; 100 points). \u2022 Team leaders should carry information about the sites they work on, such as accurate site delineations (O4; 20 points). \u2022 Fundraisers should not work on sites that have already been booked by another fundraising organisation (O5; 100 points) \u2022 No rules were dropped from the rule book following the review. Amended rules The wording of the three-step rule (C5) has been changed to say that fundraisers ought to take no more than three steps alongside a member of the public as they attempt to engage them. Previously, the three-step rule stipulated that fundraisers could take up to three steps towards a person, three steps backwards and then three steps alongside a person. The new version of the rule allows fundraisers to take any number of steps towards a person providing that, as soon as they have engaged that person, they don't follow them for more than three steps. Penalty point changes The penalties for the following rules have been increased from 50 points to 100 points. \u2022 Best behaviour (rule C1) \u2022 Deliberate obstruction (C2) \u2022 Immediate termination (C3) \u2022 Managing vulnerability (C4) \u2022 Poaching fundraising staff (O8) The penalty for the ID badges not being visible from a distance (rule C13) has been increased from 20 points to 50 points. The penalty for fundraisers working on a site for which there is not authorisation (rule O2) remains at 100 points but has been expanded and strengthened. No penalties were reduced following the review. David Mills is Editor of the Guardian Voluntary Sector Network. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.
