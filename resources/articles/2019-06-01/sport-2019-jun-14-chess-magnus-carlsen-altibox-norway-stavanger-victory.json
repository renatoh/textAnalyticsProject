The 28-year-old\u2019s status grows and the favourable comparisons with the all-time legends Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov become more insistent. The world champion\u2019s run, in a mixture of speed and classical events, began in December with the world blitz at St Petersburg and was followed by Wijk aan Zee, Shamkir, Grenke, Abidjan, Lindores Abbey and now Altibox Norway. His current unbeaten sequence in classical stretches to 68 games, so there is still some way to go to equal Ding Liren\u2019s round 100. Carlsen said: \u201cI\u2019ve been influenced by my heroes recently, which is AlphaZero and also one of my seconds from the world championship, [Daniil] Dubov, who has a lot of these ideas with sacrifices in the opening. In essence I\u2019ve become a very different player in terms of style than I was a bit earlier and it\u2019s been a great ride.\u201d Yet Norway has been an uneven performance by Carlsen in the classical section. He escaped from a dubious position against the world No 3, Ding and drew seven of his nine games In contrast Carlsen has been supreme in the controversial draw replay Armageddon sudden-death games, the chess version of 20/20 or penalty shoot-outs. He scored in his first six Armageddons, winning as White or at least drawing as Black before losing tamely to Caruana in the final round. Aronian, a distant second in the score table, said: \u201cHis opponents are just handing it to him!\u201d Spare a thought for Russia\u2019s Alexander Grischuk, demoralised by his opening-round catastrophe reported here last week. Trailing last of the 10 grandmasters, he had a second disaster when, just out of the opening, he played Bh6 to exchange Caruana\u2019s Bg7 bishop, believing his white c1 queen guarded the bishop but forgetting his own knight was on d2 twixt queen and bishop. Vishy Anand\u2019s graceful tactical finish against Ding was one of the fastest wins, though the loser missed a hidden chance. 12 Qd2 varies from 12 d4 in their classical game, and the sacrifices start with 19 Bxh6! But later 23 Nh4? is just a high-class bluff when 23 c4 exd3 24 cxd5 is complex but level. Ding then missed 24...Re2! when if 25 Qg5 d2! or 25 Qxd3 Qa6! are winning for Black.

See the puzzle solution below for the remaining moves. A new star has emerged at the women\u2019s candidates in Kazan, Russia. Aleksandra Goryachkina, 20, got in as a reserve when the No 1-rated Hou Yifan declined due to her studies at Oxford. She was the lowest-ranked of the eight players at the start but ran away from her rivals and won first prize with 9/12, 2.5 points clear of her nearest rival with two rounds still to play. Goryachkina has jumped to No 3 in the world behind the Chinese pair Hou and the reigning champion Ju Wenjun, whom she will now meet for the title. Her parents are both master level players, and she is a Moscow engineering student. Previously she was considered just a steady improver, so this is a spectacular result. The now retired Judit Polgar has been the only woman who could truly hold her own with the top men. Hou Yifan, and formerly Vera Menchik and Nona Gaprindashvili, did so to a lesser extent. Goryachkina is young enough to have a chance to join this elite. 3623: 25 Bxg7! Bxf5 26 Qh6 Re6 27 Bh8! 1-0 forces mate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
