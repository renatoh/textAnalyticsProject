I was moving to London from Paris and needed somewhere to stay for a few days before I moved into my own place; I found Hannah through couchsurfing.com. I get excited when looking for a host because I want to discover a new person and be outside my comfort zone. But I\u2019m nervous, too, because you never know if the host will appreciate you. I\u2019ve only had good experiences, but it still takes energy and courage. Hannah was easy-going and welcoming, so my fears disappeared. Her flat is small \u2013 she joked that I didn\u2019t need to be shown around as I could see it all at once \u2013 but it is comfortable. I brought cheese with me from France and we spoke in French and English. I put a mattress on the floor and made myself at home. Hannah, 26 I\u2019ve been sofa-surfing, as a guest and host, for seven years, too. When you sign up, you write what you expect from guests and what you offer. It\u2019s free accommodation, but that\u2019s not the point \u2013 it\u2019s a cultural exchange where people make friends, and it\u2019s a good way to meet locals if you\u2019re travelling and need somewhere to stay for a few days. I\u2019ve developed a good instinct. If I sense someone just wants a free place to stay, I\u2019m not interested. Justyna and I clicked straight away. She was considerate, polite and good company. Letting someone into your home takes a fair amount of effort and openness. I\u2019ve had a few dodgy experiences, but I\u2019ve never felt physically unsafe. Most times, it\u2019s all positive. \u2022 If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
