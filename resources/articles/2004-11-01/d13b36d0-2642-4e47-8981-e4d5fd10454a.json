Britain withdrew from the Gulf in 1971, rather than at the time it took its troops out of Aden, in 1967. On Britain's general departure, the Trucial States became the UAE: its first prime minister was not Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Emir of Dubai (the current prime minister), but his father, Sheikh Rashid bin Said. It is worth emphasising Sheikh Zayed's enormous economic achievement. By 1971, he had brought the economy of Abu Dhabi firmly into the black - even with its burgeoning oil revenues, his programme of public works had been so ambitious that the country had been in debt for several years. This made Sheikh Zayed first among equals with regard to the seven UAE rulers. The five-year presidential term pointed to a rotating monarchy on the Malaysian pattern, especially as the Emir of Dubai was another eminent contender to lead the group. However, in successive elections, the other rulers merely confirmed the two in their respective offices, and - with Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed now appointed president - their sons have followed them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
