The Resolution Foundation (RF) said that in the absence of action an extra 600,000 people under the age of 25 would swell dole queues, with a risk of long-term damage to their career and pay prospects. The thinktank\u2019s report said the \u201ccorona class of 2020\u201d \u2013 the 800,000 school leavers and graduates due shortly to join the labour market \u2013 was the most exposed age group to the likely unemployment surge caused by the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that 408,000 people in the 18-24 age group were unemployed. The thinktank said the crisis posed particular problems for young people. Ministers needed to respond with the offer of guaranteed jobs, focusing apprenticeship opportunities on young workers and introducing new maintenance grants to encourage the under 25s to extend their education by a year. The RF said a short-term lack of job opportunities would lead to long-term scarring of young people. Its report said employment rates of graduates entering the labour market during this crisis were projected to be 13% lower in three years\u2019 time than they would have been had the crisis never happened. Employment rates for mid- and low-skilled workers risked falling even further (by 27% and 37% respectively). Those who found work would be earning low wages, the RF said. A year after leaving education the pay of graduates is projected to be 7% lower, and 9% and 19% lower for mid- and low-skilled workers. Over the past 10 years one in three non-graduates, and one in five graduates, got their first post-education employment in sectors such as retail, hospitality, travel and leisure \u2013 the sectors hardest hit by the lockdown. Kathleen Henehan, a research and policy analyst at the RF, said: \u201cThe 800,000 young people set to leave education this year amid an unprecedented economic crisis are facing huge immediate unemployment risks, and longer-term damage to their careers. \u201cThe \u2018corona class of 2020\u2019 could face years of reduced pay and limited job prospects, long after the current economic storm has passed, unless the government provides additional support, and fast. \u201cA new maintenance support scheme could help thousands stay in education and build up their skills, while those entering the labour market for the first time should be supported by a job guarantee offering critical employment experience.\u201d Meanwhile, a separate report highlighted the fragility of Britain\u2019s companies affected by an extended lockdown. The fortnightly tracker from Opinium, a strategic agency, and the consultancy CEBR, found that more than a quarter of a million businesses would not be able to survive if trading conditions remained as they were for another month. A second wave of coronavirus infections and a subsequent lockdown could prove fatal for the business community, with the survey suggesting that 1.1m businesses could not survive three more months of lockdown. One in 10 British businesses, or almost 600,000, said there was a high risk they would enter insolvency owing to the coronavirus crisis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
