You can feel it. If we do good then it\u2019s: \u2018Yes it\u2019s good\u2019 and if we don\u2019t do good then it\u2019s: \u2018Oh, they\u2019ve done it again.\u2019\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp is well accustomed to the fluctuating emotions around Liverpool and, as the above reflection on Sevilla demonstrates, knew what was coming the moment Guido Pizarro equalised in the 93rd minute of their Champions League mayhem on Tuesday. Back on the defensive. Calling for perspective once again. Liverpool remain top of their Champions League group and can draw level on points with the champions, Chelsea, in the Premier League on Saturday with a fourth successive home win. Yet the question of trust lingers. Klopp insists he trusts this Liverpool team implicitly. He senses that belief is not universal. Liverpool\u2019s setbacks have been rare this season yet their dramatic nature has strengthened the image of a reckless team. A 5-0 defeat at Manchester City, after Sadio Man\u00e9 was sent off at 1-0; a Carabao Cup loss at Leicester City having squandered a procession of chances; a calamitous 4-1 reverse at Tottenham Hotspur, their second league defeat of the campaign; and now the second-half collapse in Andalusia. The positivity generated from straightforward wins over Southampton, West Ham United, Maribor and Huddersfield Town before the trip to Sevilla trampled in 48 minutes. Klopp maintains that only the performance at Wembley and when Liverpool \u201cstopped playing\u201d at Estadio Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n were genuine causes for concern. Two performances out of 20, in other words. And yet the manager of a team that have conceded once at home in the Premier League this season \u2013 the lowest in the division along with Manchester United \u2013 admits consistency remains \u201ca job\u201d and \u201ca challenge\u201d for Liverpool. Klopp\u2019s team have exhilarated more often than floundered this season. The issue of trust, he argues, lies with those who expect perfection. Liverpool\u2019s manager is not one of them. \u201cYes, of course I trust this team,\u201d he said before Chelsea\u2019s visit. \u201cIt depends on what you expect. Do I expect perfection and then I can trust? No. Then I could not trust, that would be true. Against Sevilla if we win 3-2 or 4-2, which was possible easily, it is exactly the same story. I cannot ignore it. \u201cThe moment we conceded the third goal then everything changed for everybody, but not for me. If you don\u2019t close the game these things can happen. \u201cWe made mistakes but they made mistakes. They made a lot of unbelievable mistakes by the way. I can trust this team. \u201cWe could have done better in a lot of games but that doesn\u2019t minimise my trust, that\u2019s the thing you have to accept. We try and try and try. In this moment we can\u2019t change anything \u201cI think it was the best lineup we could have chosen, somebody maybe thought we could have played Emre [Can] from the beginning, but there was not a lot of things with the lineup we should have changed. We were 3-0 up, we scored two goals from set pieces, fantastic, exactly the same, scored the third, played a fantastic pass for the fourth \u2013 that\u2019s a really good performance. But then you don\u2019t close the game and in an atmosphere like this then things like this can be possible.\u201d Klopp\u2019s trust extended to Alberto Moreno following another costly display by the left-back against his former club. The Liverpool manager claims he was \u201c100% responsible\u201d for Moreno\u2019s mistakes having started the defender who was treated \u201clike a family member in Sevilla\u201d and lost \u201cone, two, three per cent concentration\u201d as a consequence. \u201cI told him I still trust him 100%,\u201d added Klopp. \u201cI can imagine what people are saying. I can\u2019t be interested in that. The thing I try to really teach the players is that the only thing that is important is what I think for their future. My back is big enough to take what people say about me \u2013 if I trust him or my faith in him. We have to carry on. The problem is the whole world watches our mistakes. \u201cA lot of people say things about it, a lot of former players are saying things about it. That\u2019s our life, it will never change. We don\u2019t have to think about it.\u201d Jordan Henderson also came in for scrutiny in Seville, where the Liverpool captain and manager admitted the team\u2019s failing was not defensively but in ceasing to play with the same intent that dismantled the hosts in the first half. Klopp delivered a fierce defence of the Liverpool midfielder. \u201cIf you always big up what people are saying on social media then we talk about it as if it is the truth. Even if they are pundits it doesn\u2019t mean it makes sense,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cIn this game, I would love to see one of the big pundits on the pitch and being the person who changed the whole game. That really is fucking legend. It never happens. \u201cIf we score the fourth goal then everything is fine and Jordan is fine. Could he change the game on the pitch? No. Was he too deep in a few positions? Yes. Does that make me think he cannot play the No6 [role]? No, of course not. Can he improve? Yes. But did he improve already a lot? Wow, 100%. He is a proper captain now. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t when I first came in but only because he didn\u2019t know how to do it because nobody had to think about how to be captain at Liverpool because they had one for 20 years [in Steven Gerrard].,. \u201cFrom the first moment whatever Jordan is doing is not good enough because even when he is good he is not as good as the other one was. \u201cHe was not better than the others unfortunately [against Sevilla] but he was not worse. How you can say he needs to be better because he has the captaincy? I will never get this kind of talk. I don\u2019t understand that at all.\u201d Liverpool to raise concerns with Uefa over policing Liverpool are to raise concerns over how their supporters were treated at Sevilla with both Uefa and the Spanish club after receiving scores of complaints over aggressive policing and stewarding at Tuesday\u2019s Champions League tie. The Anfield club has opened a complaints procedure for fans to document their experiences at Estadio Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n, where Liverpool\u2019s own stewards were prevented from marshalling the away section by the Spanish authorities. Liverpool intend to take the accounts to European football\u2019s governing body and have contacted the British Embassy in Spain for guidance over the complaints against Sevilla. A statement issued by Liverpool on Friday said: \u201cThe club has also been provided with the observations of Merseyside police and the Football Association, both of whom had representatives in Seville. Given the troubling nature of the claims made by our supporters, the club feels it is appropriate that their concerns are communicated and is therefore urging all fans with a legitimate complaint to send their accounts to contactus@liverpoolfc.com at the earliest possible opportunity. \u201cIn order to facilitate the process, the club is asking supporters to provide details of: their ticket serial number, their block number, their row number, their seat number and any supporting documentation, including photographs and video footage. This information will help the club in the process of making representations on behalf of our fans.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
