Eager for more freedom, the family \u2013 mother, father and two small daughters \u2013 made their way towards what promised to be better lands. Mrs Hardini never made it to Australia: she perished when their overloaded boat bound for Christmas Island sunk in 2011. Her eight-year-old daughter Mobina also died. But Athena survived. The 17-year-old sits on her hands as she talks, quietly, on the grounds of Brisbane\u2019s Yeronga state high school. \u201cI was very frightened,\u201d she says. \u201cIn Iran, in year 7, they teach you how to swim. But my sister was one year younger than me. So she didn\u2019t learn how.\u201d Hardini was rescued by a passing fishing boat; her father, having clung to wreckage for three days in the water, was also saved. Now safely in Australia, Hardini hopes to become an opera singer, like her mother. Next year, she wants to apply to study opera at Griffith\u2019s Queensland Conservatorium. For her audition, she is planning to sing a song from sci-fi movie The Fifth Element, one that reminds her of her past. \u201cMy mum and my sister died in the ocean. It\u2019s like she was in the music. [When I listen to it] I remember the ocean.\u201d It is her story \u2013 and perseverance, plus love of opera \u2013 that has helped inspire a new initiative in the school she goes to: Songs of Belonging. Opera Queensland first worked with Hardini as an individual student. But in a school where 65% of students were born overseas and roughly 40% are refugees or seeking asylum, Mark Taylor, head of learning for the company, realised more could be done. They invited guest composer Helen Franzmann, baritone Jason Barry-Smith, mezzo soprano Jessica Low and musical director Trevor Jones to help students develop their own song. Eighteen students signed up for the six-week project, in which they were asked: what makes you feel like you belong? In a performance on Thursday night, attended by friends and family, they bopped on stage: some students played the guitar or flute; some sang in the chorus; some did solos. At various points they walked up to the microphone to tell their own stories. \u201cI belong to Australia because I can do most of the things that I cannot do in Iran \u2013 I can sing,\u201d says Hardini, who has dreams of performing in front of Simon Cowell in America\u2019s Got Talent. \u201cIn Iran, people cannot be free. You have to do all things secretly.\u201d In 2016, a national opera review found that Opera Queensland had been operating at a loss, leading to questions whether it should retain its status and funding as a major performing arts company. But while that review referred mostly to the main-stage productions, it has for years conducted community outreach, in this case receiving a $12,000 boost from the Celebrating Multicultural Queensland grant. \u201cOpera can glaze over young people,\u201d says Taylor, but it is simply \u201cnarrative told through song. It\u2019s about the power of the human voice. Community engagement shouldn\u2019t be the lovely stuff on top. It should be the guts of what we\u2019re doing: it tests the elasticity of opera.\u201d Songs of Belonging is one of two Opera Queensland projects held this month: in Composed in Queensland, the company worked with students from 11 regional schools to create a song about growing up in the drought-stricken central west. \u201cIt was lovely to see them discover that music can have a function beyond something that\u2019s on the radio,\u201d says indie star Megan Washington who, alongside country music singer Sara Storer, travelled to Longreach last week to teach the kids. In the remote communities, the unrelenting dry spell was the children\u2019s biggest concern. Yet, just before Washington arrived, it rained. \u201cAnd the kids went mental!\u201d she says. \u201cThey all said, \u2018We want rain\u2019. There were some kids there who had never seen rain \u2013 it was pretty incredible.\u201d In Yeronga state high school, located in Brisbane\u2019s inner city, students have a different challenge: namely poverty, fitting in and often traumatic pasts. For Songs of Belonging they were asked to tell their stories \u2013 giving as little or as much as they wanted to share. One girl, from New Caledonia, felt she couldn\u2019t talk but her narrative became the chorus: \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t speak it / Just know that I feel it.\u201d \u201cMusic is the universal language,\u201d says Yaronga\u2019s music teacher Kiera Deakin. \u201cWe can speak different languages but still be together through music: everyone is open to sharing their music and their background. There is no judgment.\u201d For Ciro Kurilic \u2013 a tall boy with an open, friendly face who wants to become a nurse \u2013 that means beatboxing. \u201cKeeping me human is beatboxing. I got offered an opportunity to do a video, got offered a bit of money, it put me back on where I want to go,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s the gym to let out stress, boxing to let out anger, but music really just lets it all out.\u201d His family, who still have no home after fleeing a domestic incident, currently lives in a refuge in Brisbane. \u201cWe\u2019re actually happy,\u201d says the 16-year-old with a big grin. \u201cWhy? Because I\u2019m alive.\u201d Ugandan student Steven George, meanwhile, admits he\u2019s not the best singer. But in the chorus for Songs of Belonging, his moves are infectious (including a surprise splits). His wishes his mother could have attended the performance but she can\u2019t drive and it is hard for her to travel to the school. His father was murdered in Uganda (poisoned by jealous neighbours, he says) but, with the rest of the family now in Australia, he feels he can do anything. \u201cSince my dad died, I threw [away] all my fears, I fight for myself,\u201d says the 17-year-old. On Thursday night, as the song is finally performed, George gets up, walks over to the mike, throws back his shoulders, and declares proudly to the audience: \u201cI belong. They took away the person I love more than anyone in this world: my dad. \u201cEvery morning I look in the mirror and I see him. And I wish he could see how strong I am now.\u201d \u2022 The Guardian was a guest of Opera Queensland"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
