The company also plans to almost double employee contribution levels from 5% to 9.2%, cap any pension increases at 2.5% and make other cuts to benefits in a package of moves worth \u00a31.1bn. The initiative is designed to tackle a growing pension hole at BAE as lifespans have increased. Between 1981 and 2002, life expectancy for those aged 65 and over increased by three years for men and two years for women. In return for a huge shake-up in employee benefits, BAE has promised to inject \u00a31.1bn through a one-off and additional payments into the pension fund. It will also increase its own monthly contributions to tackle the \u00a33.1bn pension hole. The company, which owns a stake in the pan-European aircraft manufacturer Airbus, has also pleased its staff by agreeing to keep the much-valued final-salary scheme, unlike most other UK firms. Mike Turner, BAE's chief executive, said he was \"delighted\" to have drawn up a package of measures to overcome what had represented a serious challenge for the company. \"We have worked in close consultation with our employees, trades unions and scheme trustees to develop pension arrangements acceptable and affordable to both company and its people,\" he added. Staff members at BAE, which include shipyard and Royal Ordnance workers, have already voted by substantial margins to accept the new retirement plan. John Wall, general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said: \"The strength of the BAE Systems agreement lies in the way they conducted the consultation process. \"We were all involved in helping develop the solution and had full visibility of the information ... I would like to see more companies take this lead,\" he added. BAE said in February it would make a \u00a3350m one-off contribution to its pension programme in the current year through a mix of cash and the transfer of property. The package envisages the pension deficit will be eliminated in about 10 years and could be down to \u00a3500m by 2016. Meanwhile, the finance director, George Rose, shrugged off setbacks such as the investigation into allegations of corruption surrounding Saudi contracts. The former chairman Sir Richard Evans and Damian Turner, a previous Middle East boss, are among senior executives interviewed by the Serious Fraud Office. \"I don't see any effect. The company is continuing to trade well,\" said Mr Rose but he would not be drawn into speculation when the inquiry would end. \"There is no timetable,\" he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
