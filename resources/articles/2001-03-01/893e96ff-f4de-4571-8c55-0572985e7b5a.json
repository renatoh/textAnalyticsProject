For omens too, for everyone knows Tottenham Hotspur only win the FA Cup when there is a \"one\" at the end of a year. The London club set the sequence in motion a century ago this spring when they beat Sheffield United by 3-1 in a replayed final. Also in 1901, Tottenham played host to arguably the first international match involving a team from outside the British Isles - England 12, Germany 0 - which an upstaged Football Association at once pronounced \"unsanctioned and unofficial\" and said such a concept in the future was deemed \"unworkable for the obvious variety of administrative and logistical reasons\". It was not to sanction an \"official\" international for another seven years - Austria 1, England 6, Vienna, 1908, as part of preparations for that summer's Olympic Games competition in London. That pioneering international at Tottenham took place with football's structures scarcely formed. Only 10 years before, for instance, had referees been given exclusive powers to arbitrate, and penalty-kicks had been added to the laws. That same seminal year, 1891, had seen goal nets made compulsory. There also took place a crucial meeting in Sheffield between the fledgling Football League and its rival Football Alliance in which an elite \"Premier\" English league was almost formed. The proposal was a merger which would result in three national divisions of just 12 clubs each. After \"heated debate\" the idea was thrown out - in no time the first two divisions of the Football League had 40 clubs taking part, and it was not long till representation in the congested four divisions numbered over 90. Goal nets were \"invented\" by the go-ahead city engineer of Liverpool, JA Brodie. A year or two before, he had noticed in the local press an increasing number of dis putes concerning the validity of goals and had dashed off, apparently in less than half an hour, a choice of possible designs involving goalposts (the hitherto common taped \"crossbar\" had been banned by the FA in 1882 and three fixed pieces of wood made compulsory) with netting affixed, sent it off to the local patents office and, to all intents, forgotten all about it. The 1890-91 season began with a series of whinges over disputed scores by spectators and players alike, and before Christmas 1890 Brodie had a pair of nets made up. The Old Etonians' northern side agreed to use them for a game at their Liverpool ground in Stanley Park. The experiment was a palpable success and Brodie circulated the clubs. By January 1891, at Nottingham Forest's old pitch at Woodward's Field on the town side of Trent Bridge, Brodie had hung his two nets on the goalposts before a prestigious North v South fixture, and 110 Marches ago, the league agreed that nets should be compulsory by the start of the 1891-92 season \"when it was agreed with the patentee what price should be paid for the netting\". Certainly, they were billowingly installed at the Oval for the 1892 \"Brummie\" Cup final between West Bromwich Albion and Aston Villa - by which time, well pleased, Brodie continued with his day job at the council and settled down to engineering Britain's first dual carriageway, Liverpool's handsome Queen's Drive. He later helped design for the government the far more regally sumptuous New Delhi - but goal-nets will forever be his most notable memorial. Before 1891, referees in football were like today's new-fangled \"third umpire\" in Test cricket. Through the 1870s and 1880s clubs had been required to provide an umpire of their own and the two of them made all the decisions, halting play originally by waving a white handkerchief and, doubtless, bellowing - a whistle was only introduced in 1879 (again at Nottingham Forest). Before each kick-off, the two umpires were expected to appoint a touchline \"referee\" who could only make his defining decision if the two of them appealed to him to settle their own dispute. But in 1891, the role of the umpires was drastically diminished. They were banished to the touchlines, to be called \"line-men\", and it was the referee who was allowed to roam the pitch as \"sole arbiter\". I daresay the change only helped focus the increasing venom by crowds on to one man when his decisions went against their team, as this poignant letter by a referee to the correspondance columns of the Preston Standard that year testified. It followed the previous Saturday's match at Bolton between the local side and Preston North End: \"Dear Sir, Immediately the game had started I could see too much emnity all along the ranks of spectators for the match to be played in any amiable spirit as I found myself being cursed and sworn at by a body of dirty low blackguards, who stood at the goal and touchline nearest the entrance gates and threatened at once to smash my (adjective) jaw when the game was over. I was vexed, but continued to give my decisions honestly and fairly ... \"After the affair was over I was tackled at once by a flock of infuriated beings in petticoats supposed to be women, indeed mothers too if I may judge from the innocent babes suckling at their breasts. They brandished their umbrellas at me, and voted me everything that was bad ... I then got into a house to dress, but my whereabouts was discovered and the same rabble swore to wait till I came out ...\" Ah, the beautiful game. And so it goes on. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
