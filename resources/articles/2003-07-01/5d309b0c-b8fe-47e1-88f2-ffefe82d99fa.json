The investment firm alleges it was fooled into lending the money to City Truck Group after executives at the haulage company falsified documents to give a misleading picture of its financial health. City Truck went into administration last year. City of London Police are thought to have been investigating GE's claim for months, and searched five addresses last week. The force confirmed it had 'seized documentation in connection with an allegation of invoice discounting fraud, totalling in excess of \u00a315 million'. GE's claim against City Truck is contained in a writ filed at the High Court in London. In 2000, it agreed to extend a credit line worth up to \u00a325m to City Truck to cover the haulage firm's unpaid invoices. The money was to be paid back when the invoices were collected. But City Truck allegedly produced fake invoices in order to draw on the facility. When the company went bust, GE could not retrieve its money. GE estimates its losses are at least \u00a315m but 'likely on further investigation to be a higher amount'. GE accuses four former City Truck executives - David Gee, Kevin Smedley, John Steel and Kevin Ritchie - and is suing for the return of the funds. They deny wrongdoing and are fighting the claim."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
