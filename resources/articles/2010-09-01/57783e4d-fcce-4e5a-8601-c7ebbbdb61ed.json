Yet Romero's astonishing outpouring, born of her emotional intensity, precipitated a total withdrawal \u2013 she has not raced on a track, or even been spotted in the vicinity of a velodrome, since Beijing. That is, until today. With her club team, Romero will ride the women's team pursuit before a full house at the British national track cycling championships at the Manchester Velodrome. Since she last raced, Chris Hoy has become Sir Chris, Victoria Pendleton has carried on winning, and Bradley Wiggins has emerged as a Tour de France contender, while Romero \u2013 the fourth in the track team's gang of individual gold medallists \u2013 has, it seems, been mulling things over, deciding what to do next. \"I've had ups and downs since Beijing,\" admits Romero on the eve of her return. \"I lost my event [the individual pursuit] from the Olympic Games, and I had to take a step back to see what I wanted to do. \"I decided that I definitely want to be in London, because I know there's still more in me as an athlete. But we're at the two-year marker now, or past it. I've got to put the hammer down, and get the focus and performances back.\" Romero, whose first Olympic medal came in rowing, a silver in 2004, had been tipped after Beijing to go for a third sport. And she did seriously consider it, she says. \"Oh yeah,\" she says, with some of the intensity she showed in China. \"What person in the world \u2013 in the position I was in \u2013 wouldn't contemplate it? \"It was something that would totally appeal to me. But I looked into the Olympic sports and it's just not feasible. There just wasn't an obvious sport. I looked at canoeing, because of that element of it being a repetitive skill-based sport, with the water skills I'd had from rowing. Again, though, canoeing was another sport hit by changes to the Olympic programme. It's more sprint-based now, which to me was a complete no-no. \"But then I thought: 'Why would I walk away from a sport I'm happy in?' Thinking about it, it's a ludicrous idea, but in the back of my mind, the idea to do that was there. I left rowing because I didn't like the system, but why walk away from a system and a set-up I liked and that was working for me?\" One of her \"downs\" came last December, after Romero decided to return to cycling, when it was announced that the pursuit was to be axed from the Olympics. \"My real motivation coming back was to take that event that I was a specialist at and develop it,\" she says. \"There were still barriers to be broken there, world records to set. I also wanted to develop in my second event, the points race [which was also axed]. \"But when they were just culled [she spits out the word], that was like, my whole world fell in. I was thinking that was it for my career. I'd just started making a return, so it was a bit of a devastating thing to come to terms with.\" With her coach, Dan Hunt, Romero decided, after experimenting with road time-trialling, to turn her attention to the only endurance discipline left on the track: the team pursuit. Hunt mentions in passing that Romero had been attracted to cycling in the first place because it offered a pathway to individual glory; one of the aspects of rowing that frustrated her was that it was team-based. Yet he is confident she can return to her best for London, because it has been her decision. \"She was very close to not returning,\" Hunt says. \"She needed the time out. People who've won Olympic gold medals, they're pretty special people. If they say they need a break, they're not inherently lazy, so you have to listen. If you push them at that point, you're going to lose them. And the bottom line is, if we get a well-motivated Becks in London then our chances go through the roof. \"She is very driven, which can make you very successful, but it can be destructive at times as well,\" continues Hunt. \"But she's in a good place; she's striking a nice balance in her life now between 'work' and other things.\" So it's the team pursuit for Romero in London, starting today with her Orbea\u2013 For Goodness Shakes! team-mates Emilie Fisher and Janet Birkmyre. \"It's going to be tough,\" Romero cautions. \"It's not guaranteed I'll be selected; with the team pursuit now in the Olympics the competition is going to be tough to get in the team, never mind win.\" In Beijing, Romero admitted: \"My biggest fear is not doing what I say I can do, and falling flat on my face.\" Her tone on the eve of her comeback suggests she would dearly love another Olympic gold, but that she is not staking her life on it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
