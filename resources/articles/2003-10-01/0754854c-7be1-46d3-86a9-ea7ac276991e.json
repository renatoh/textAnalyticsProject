The exception is surely Marrakech, now in its third year but developing so fast that whoever first called it \"le petit Cannes\" spoke truer than he or she knew. Many an older, more established festival would envy the number of heavyweight stars it attracts, its setting in Morocco's most fashionable resort, and above all the patronage it receives from the country's royal family, which leads sponsors producing lavish parties every night to match the King's dinner that annually opens the event. Although security was tight after the Casablanca bomb blast last May, with troops and police everywhere, the festival seemed to transcend difficult times with some ease. The raison d'etre of the event was initially to encourage international film-makers to come to Morocco to shoot, and it seems to have done a good job. Ridley Scott and Oliver Stone, both with big bucks to spend, are filming in Morocco, and both directors were at the festival, with further famous names almost certain to follow in the future. Scott's film is Kingdom of Heaven, an epic about Saladin which bids to rival Gladiator, while Stone's is his version of the life and times of Alexander the Great. But what of the films the festival itself displays? Here Marrakesh is in a bit of a bind. True, it has a programme that's clearly carefully chosen by people who know what they are about, chiefly but not entirely from France. One cannot imagine any former British colony in Africa mounting anything remotely as good. The bind is that this year's 12-film competition was composed almost entirely of movies from other festivals, many of them already awarded prizes. And if Marrakesh wants to be on the festival A-list, the competition would have to be composed of films that haven't been seen anywhere else. It could happen, but after Venice in early September and San Sebastian late in the same month, both of which have A-list competitions, there simply aren't the quality films available. The other alternative for Marrakesh, blessed with so much in its favour, is to forget about A-status and to produce a competition for Arab films in a similar vein to Carthage. Many of those attending this year, and some of the younger organisers, feel that this is the answer -- something which would make Marrakesh unique in the Arab world since Carthage only takes place once every two years and hasn't the patronage to compete. There was criticism last year that the festival was, in fact, merely a French jamboree with Moroccan trimmings, equipped with a dozen or so French stars. The programmers this time round were clearly anxious to correct that impression. The event started off with a Moroccan film - Faouzi Bensaidi's Mille Mois, a first feature much admired at Cannes where it won the youth prize and came second in the Certain Regard competition. There were also several other Moroccan films on display and the burgeoning Arab cinema was given considerably more weight than before. But the feeling remains that Marrakesh could develop further in this direction and become the place on the map for Arab films, particularly if an Arab competition were to give money prizes to the winners. Making films in Arab countries is a hairy business at the best of times, and most Arab film-makers have to go outside their home countries for finance. Mille Mois, for instance,was a co-production between Morocco, France and Belgium. Money prizes could only help script development and hopefully attract Arab films away from the A-list festivals earlier in the year. Meanwhile, the international jury, headed by Volker Schlondorff, the German director who won Cannes with The Tin Drum, gave its Etoile D'Or to Pierre Zalica's Fuses, from Bosnia, an ironic and sometimes bitter and rueful comedy about a small town rife with ethnic intolerance and corruption which has one week to clean itself up before the arrival on a visit of Bill Clinton, the then US president. They also gave Bogdan Diklic, its excellent leading player, the best actor award. The jury prize went to Tom McCarthy's The Station Agent, a charming and sympathetic American independent movie already prized at Sundance and San Sebastian, about a very short man who has withdrawn from life rather than face the curious attention he invariably attracts. As in Venice, Takeshi Kitano won the best director award for Zatoichi, his lively and amusing samurai epic which, like The Station Agent, went down a storm with the Moroccan audience. But the Moroccans, particularly the critics, were not so pleased with Jacques Doillon's Raja, for which Najat Benssallem won the best actress award. This is about a rich middle-aged Frenchman in Marrakesh who falls for a Moroccan girl and finds that, if he wants to have her, money colours any relationship. Some felt that the film was an insult to Moroccan women which suggested that poverty makes them sell themselves to the highest bidders. Others that the film was an effective metaphor for Franco-Moroccan relations in general. Possibly it was neither, but a typical example of Doillon's quirky studies of human relationships, made in the town where he has a home. Perhaps the greatest success of the festival this year, at least with the public, was a Bollywood programme which attracted Amitabh Bachchan, mobbed by huge crowds wherever he went,and included Maqbool, an advance showing of the film by Vishal Bhardwaj based somewhat loosely on Shakespeare's Macbeth, transposed to the dark underworld of the Indian mafia. If Shakespeare might have turned in his grave at the result, no one could deny the film's potential as a crowd-pleaser. Bollywood, it seems, is bigger than Hollywood in Morocco, where Saddam is more popular than Bush, at least in unofficial circles. The festival keeps very quiet about politics but, behind the scenes, it is there, like certain uninvited guests."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
