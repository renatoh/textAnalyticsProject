One half of the country experiences older age in comfort, with a relaxing retirement, a chance to kick back and enjoy life's luxuries and do all those things that eluded people in their working lives. The other side of the coin is bleak. For many, older age is about poverty, loss of opportunity and independence and the loss of dignity and those who are loved. This is the reality of unequal ageing. Income inequality and pensioner poverty are rarely out of the spotlight \u2013 government itself has attempted to tackle both, with varying degrees of success. Significant pension reform proposals for the future have bolstered the policy changes that heralded a income guarantee for older people. Yet, these steps in the right direction are not delivering the success which many of us hoped for \u2013 pensioner poverty is on the rise and ministers have still not made a binding commitment to eradicate pensioner poverty as has been declared with poverty among children. This rate of progress means that inequality will persist. Older people remain unequal consumers, unequal in spending power and as a corollary, unequal in life chances. Such a position is unsustainable as our population ages remorselessly. Help the Aged has decided to put unequal ageing under the microscope. Our own focus on disadvantage among older people has led us to conclude that a forensic analysis of what causes such negative life chances is urgently required. Today, the work and pensions secretary, James Purnell, will address a seminar organised by the charity to examine how the injustice of unequal ageing can be addressed. His engagement in the subject \u2013 along with academics, specialists, stakeholders, journalists and older people themselves \u2013 is a welcome addition to a debate that needs to be stepped out to achieve radical change. If society is to truly end material deprivation among older people, then politicians, policy makers and influencers have got to take notice. We must support the need for an adequate income for pensioners far above the current meagre levels offered by basic state pension. State benefits must be paid in a more intelligent, seamless way to reduce the shocking levels of unclaimed entitlements which \u2013 by a recent estimation \u2013 now stands at \u00a35bn per year. The need to level the playing field in access to credit and purchasing power of those less affluent pensioners calls for an end to concepts such as pre-payment meters which penalise the poorest. The injustice of discounts offered to customers who pay by direct debit - something many pensioners cannot ever hope to do by virtue of a lack of basic banking facilities - must also cease. The facts are shocking. The poorest older people are over five times more likely to have poor health and are twice as likely to feel isolated from the rest of society. Tolerating these statistics is simple unacceptable in the 21st century. Help the Aged and our supporters cannot stand idly by and watch some of the most marginalised and vulnerable members of our society suffer. Despite all the recent economic and financial tribulations of our economy, we still live in one of the richest nations on earth. Now is the time to begin to act like it. \u2022 Paul Cann is director of policy at Help the Aged. The charity is running a series of seminars exploring concepts of unequal ageing.
