He is that rare thing: a writer whose substantial ambitions are matched by an acute understanding of the way people actually behave. His 2012 play Constellations was a runaway success, taking its examination of love and quantum physics from London's Royal Court to the West End, and scoring a clutch of award nominations. Blurred Lines, staged in January in the National Theatre's Shed, proved a complete change of tack: an explosive examination of gender politics, performed by an all-female cast. With Incognito, premiering at the HighTide Festival theatre \u2013 that powerhouse of new writing whose annual festival brings a roster of high-quality theatre to Suffolk \u2013 and co-produced by the excellent young company Nabokov, Payne returns to his central preoccupation with science. Taking neuroscience as his theme, he tells three interconnected stories \u2013 that of Thomas Stoltz Harvey, the pathologist who, in 1955, stole Albert Einstein's brain for private study; Henry, a patient undergoing pioneering brain surgery in Bath in 1953; and Martha, a neuropsychologist in contemporary London attempting to make sense of her present and her past. The complex, restless narrative unfolds in a series of brief, fragmented scenes, performed with lightning-fast reflexes by the superb cast of four, who are required to swap characters (and accents) with split-second accuracy. The effect is sometimes bewildering \u2013 I advise carefully studying the synopsis first \u2013 and Payne could have thought harder about how to ensure his audience can always keep up with his rapid-fire sequence of ideas. But this is an intelligent, ambitious work that poses as many questions as it answers \u2013 much like the human brain itself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
