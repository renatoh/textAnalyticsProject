Eight million will be eligible. This huge number reflects the poor performance of our education system the first time round. Nearly half of all young people fail to get five good GCSEs at 16. But second chances can never adequately compensate for underachievement at school. Catching up is harder and less effective than getting it right first time. Current spending on education and training places too much emphasis on second chances that do little to improve the prospects of the low skilled. If education is to make a real contribution to life chances, we should spend more earlier to ensure more young people succeed first time round. The government spends about \u00a37bn on education and training for low-skilled young people and adults. Many programmes do little to make participants more employable. In some cases, participants are worse off after completing the programme than if they had done nothing at all. For example, participants who opted for a year's training through the new deal for young people were less likely to get a job than those who were simply offered help looking for one. Similar programmes in the US, Canada and other European countries have an equally poor track record. Those who miss out at school and take a GCSE-level qualification as adults are likely to end up with a level 2 national vocational qualification (NVQ). In theory, this is equivalent to five good GCSEs - but not in practice. Most adults do not see much improvement in their employment prospects, having worked hard for their NVQ 2. Why do second-chance programmes perform so badly? In part, it's a failure of the government. University researchers internationally agree that training low-skilled adults in the classroom does little to improve their employment prospects. Workplace training and subsidised jobs are far better routes into permanent employment. But the government is reluctant to admit it has got the policy wrong. As a result, huge sums continue to be poured into worthless schemes. More fundamentally, it is harder to learn as we get older. Skills are more easily developed early in life. An early start also boosts the effect of later education by building lifelong competence and motivation for learning. A comparison of the costs and benefits of investing at different ages illustrates how the effectiveness of each pound spent on education decreases with age. High quality pre-schools have been found to create \u00a33 worth of economic and social benefit for every pound spent. By comparison, the benefits of training programmes for young people who leave school with few qualifications rarely exceed the costs by as much as three to one. Programmes for older, low-skilled workers struggle to be cost-neutral. The most productive time to invest in education is in the first five years of life. But public spending on education and training increases with age. The UK spends more than twice as much on each student in further education, and three times as much on each student in higher education, as it does on each child under five: \u00a34,300 and \u00a35,300 a year respectively compared with \u00a31,800, in 2003. Under-investment in the early years means a significant number of 16-year-olds will still fail to get five GCSEs at A*-C in the future. Reallocating spending to support additional investment in children under five would provide a strong foundation for raising attainment at 16. Significant savings could be made on training for the low-skilled by replacing ineffective classroom programmes with wage subsidies. Subsidised work is a far more effective way to secure permanent employment. It is also far cheaper: \u00a3398 a month, compared with \u00a3929 a month for training, according to a study of Swedish labour market programmes conducted by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. This would release money to be invested earlier. Over time, investing early will reduce the numbers reliant on ineffective second chances. It will always be necessary to offer second chances. No education system, however good, can guarantee that everyone succeeds first time around. Those who do not should have the opportunity to improve their prospects later in life. But an education system that consistently fails nearly half of all young people first time round, and then invests to help them catch up later, is wasting talent and money in equal measure. \u00b7 Vidhya Alakeson is a research fellow at the Social Market Foundation"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
