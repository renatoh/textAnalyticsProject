While flagging a shake-up of its policies to take to the next election, Chalmers dismissed suggestions Labor should follow through on its pre-election pledge to conduct a review into Newstart, calling it an \u201cunfortunate consequence\u201d of the Coalition\u2019s victory. \u201cThat review won\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of things we were proposing which had the potential to make a real difference to people\u2019s lives, and when you think about what happened on election night, one of the things that does get you down is that we were not able to implement some of those policies and plans that we think would have made a real difference, particularly to vulnerable people in Australia. \u201cWe have to accept the reality that we are three years from another election. I don\u2019t think a review at the start of that from the opposition would necessarily shift the needle on Newstart. \u201cIf people want to see a boost to Newstart, they have to convince the government.\u201d Chalmers also used the speech to outline Labor\u2019s reasons for opposing the government\u2019s $158bn tax cut package in its current form, saying the $95bn benefit to high income earners could not be justified. The party is resisting pressure to support the full tax package, instead calling for the government to split the legislation, accelerate infrastructure spending and bring forward tax cuts already legislated. It is also demanding more information from the government about the economic flow-on effect of tax cuts for higher income earners. \u201cMy concern is that you get more bang for buck from tax relief from the people who are most likely to spend it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economic impact of tax cuts on the economy is different depending on how much disposable income you have and how much you are likely to spend the proceeds of a tax cut. \u201cIf the government wanted our vote, they would give us the information we are seeking.\u201d After saying he believed the language about the \u201ctop end of town\u201d during the election campaign was misplaced, Chalmers also said the party would be reviewing all of its policies following its defeat. But he said it was too early to say which pre-election pledges would be dumped. \u201cWe won\u2019t take the identical policy suite to the 2022 election that we took to the 2019 election,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will obviously learn the lessons of what happened in the election campaign and why we got the result we did \u2013 it is the whole reason why we have been hitting the road and listening to people. \u201cWe will come up with an agenda for the next election which isn\u2019t the same as the last one which revisits our policies, revisits our language, frankly, but doesn\u2019t revisit our values.\u201d As Labor revisits its policy platform, the government is remaining firm on its demand that its election tax cut pledge is passed in its entirety or not at all, with Mathias Cormann to put forward a motion to extend the Senate\u2019s sitting hours next week, until the legislation passes. But while Cormann may have his expectations of what is going to happen, Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick said any extended sitting hours would be entirely at the will of the Senate, not the government. \u201cHe certainly hasn\u2019t sought any agreement with us on that and he would probably need it,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cI say that noting that anyone who is likely to vote against the tax package will vote against an hours extension and even those who may be for elements of the plan don\u2019t see the urgency the government is placing on it \u2013 the parliament will sit again in a couple of weeks time and it won\u2019t make that much difference. \u201cAt this stage, we haven\u2019t made a decision we\u2019re not convinced of the merits of extending the sittings \u2013 Senator Cormann can put forward a proposition to the Senate, but it is a step too far to say that he will make the Senate do anything.\u201d Patrick and his Centre Alliance Senate colleague Stirling Griff control two votes in the Senate, where the government needs four crossbench votes to pass legislation Labor opposes. With Cory Bernardi expected to vote with the government in most instances, One Nation and Centre Alliance, along with newly returned senator Jacqui Lambie become the crucial votes. Patrick said Centre Alliance had been in talks with Lambie to work together on legislation they share common ground on. \u201cThree really is the magic number,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cStirling, myself and Jacqui can provide a pathway to the government to pass legislation, but it can also provide a block. For example, Centre Alliance and Jacqui both have difficulties with the government\u2019s \u2018ensuring integrity\u2019 legislation in its current form, which would prevent it from going through the Senate. \u201cWe are talking about working together when we have a common agreement. But we won\u2019t be saying which way she intends on going on something and she won\u2019t be talking about us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
