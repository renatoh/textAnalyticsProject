The insurer's shares added 5.5p to 133.2p following reports it would not, after all, be calling on shareholders for cash to fund a major acquisition. Instead it would be more likely to look at smaller deals. Last month investors took fright at the prospect that RSA was looking at a \u00a3600m deal, after remarks made at an investment conference. At the time RSA played down this scenario, stressing its management had not said anything specific on acquisition strategy. A positive note from broker Cazenove yesterday also helped its shares. Among rival insurers, Legal &amp; General edged up 0.25p to 85.45p as takeover talk refused to die down, but Aviva slipped 1.5p to 451.1p as it confirmed the flotation of part of its Dutch business, Delta Lloyd. Royal Bank of Scotland added 1.92p to 48.56p and Lloyds Banking Group rose 0.21p to 94.96p after the Financial Services Authority said banks would have several years to comply with tougher liquidity rules. Rio Tinto was 58.5p better at \u00a325.64 on hopes its talks with the Mongolian government over the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold project, in which Rio has a potential 31% stake, would be soon completed. Meanwhile analysts at RBS raised their metal price forecasts and share price targets on several miners. RBS lifted its rating on Rio from hold to buy, and made similar moves for BHP Billiton, up 32p to \u00a316.59, and Vedanta Resources, 35p higher at \u00a319.12. The bank moved its recommendation on Antofagasta, up 26.5p to 746.5p, from sell to buy and its target for Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, 38p better at 844p, from 670p to 850p. The FTSE 100 closed up 35.63 points at 5024.33. The rise accelerated after a bright opening on Wall Street after news the US service sector had grown last month after about a year of decline. Military goods maker Chemring climbed 217p to \u00a326.17 after its US subsidiary won a five-year contract worth up to $804m (\u00a3504m) to supply decoy flares to the US defence department. Immunodiagnostic Systems jumped 60p to 467.5p after an upbeat trading statement. The maker of diagnostic testing kits said turnover for the six months to the end of September had climbed 56% and was confident about the rest of the year. It has signed a deal to supply equipment and reagents to Italian diagnostics specialist Technogenetics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
