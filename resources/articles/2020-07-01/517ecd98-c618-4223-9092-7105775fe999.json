Florida marked a record-breaking spike in the death toll, while Los Angeles and Maricopa, Arizona have marked the highest number of cases in the US. Donald Trump once again delivered a coronavirus briefing alone, without his leading public health officers. The president complained that top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci had a higher approval rating, and defended his promotion of a disinformation video. Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr both promoted a video featuring misinformation about the coronavirus. Twitter suspended rump Jr\u2019s account for spreading false claims after he shared the video of a doctor falsely claiming that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is a \u201ccure\u201d for coronavirus. Trump also discussed his administration\u2019s $765m loan to Eastman Kodak - the camera company - so it can manufacture pharmaceutical ingredients. The move leverages the Defense Production Act, which allows the government to direct the production of certain supplies in the interest of national security. Attorney general William Barr testified before the House judiciary committee. During the hearing, Barr struggled over a question about whether presidents should be allowed to solicit or accept foreign assistance in elections, and he said he did not believe that there is systemic racism in US police departments. Seattle\u2019s mayor Jenny Durkan confirmed that federal forces have left the city she represents. The mayor denounced the Trump administration for sending federal law enforcement to act against US citizens, saying in an MSNBC interview that the president had conducted a \u201cdress rehearsal for martial law.\u201d Joe Biden criticized Trump for sending federal agents to crack down on anti-racism protests in Portland, Oregon. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about law and order. It\u2019s about a political strategy to revive a failing campaign,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate said in Wilmington, Delaware. \u201cEvery instinct Trump has is to add fuel to the fire. And it\u2019s the last thing, the last thing we need.\u201d The Trump administration will allow \u201cdreamers\u201d to renew deportation protections for a year, after the supreme court blocked the administration\u2019s effort to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. However, the acting homeland security secretary also announced that the department would not accpet new DACA applications. The American Federation of Teachers has authorized \u201csafety strikes\u201d if necessary to protect teachers from coronavirus. The announcement comes as number of school districts in coronavirus hot spots are pushing to reopen schools, despite concerns about the spread of the virus in classrooms. Mayor Jenny Durkan said that federal law enforcement sent to Seattle have left, less than a week after being deployed. In an interview with MSNBC, Durkan said that Trump was \u201cdoing a dress rehearsal for martial law\u201d in her city. Governor Jay Inslee noted that the departure of federal officers \u201cmeans Washingtonians no longer have to worry about the White House\u2019s aim to provoke confrontation and undermine peaceful protests\u201d. The president has given key diplomatic roles to big donors \u2013 who have stood out for their lack of qualifications or aptitude The US ambassador to Iceland, a dermatologist and major Republican donor, reportedly became so paranoid about his security he asked to carry a gun and to be taken everywhere in an armored car. Despite the absence of particular security concerns, the embassy in Reykjavik advertised in the local press for bodyguards, to placate the ambassador, Jeffrey Ross Gunter. Gunter\u2019s alleged antics are not an isolated case. A record share of Donald Trump\u2019s ambassadorial appointments have been political, mostly rewards for big-money donors, and his nominees have frequently stood out for their lack of qualifications or aptitude. A report to be published on Tuesday by Senate Democrats on the current situation at the state department, titled Diplomacy in Crisis, said: \u201cWhile it is true that every administration has its share of questionable appointments, the Trump administration\u2019s choices have gone beyond the pale, jeopardizing the department\u2019s ability to safeguard our nation\u2019s interests.\u201d A San Francisco bus driver who was assaulted last week said that both he and his Asian passengers have faced racist abuse when they have asked other riders to wear their face masks during the pandemic. The driver said he was hit in the face and struck with a miniature baseball bat last Wednesday after asking a group of teenagers to put on their face masks. Before he was assaulted, the driver said, one of the young men told him that because he was Asian, he was the one who was likely to have coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s hard right now being a bus driver, especially being an Asian driver,\u201d he told the Guardian, asking that his name not be published to protect his privacy. Since the early weeks of the pandemic, bus drivers across the United States have spoken out about anger and assaults from passengers, particularly when they try to enforce public health rules about social distancing and mask-wearing. Just in the past month, bus drivers have been beaten after asking passengers to wear masks in San Francisco, New York City and in Lubbock, Texas, where a bus driver was hit with a large wooden board and left bloody. A New York City driver reportedly left with a broken bone near his eye in July was one of dozens of Covid-related violent incidents involving bus drivers in New York, according to the City, a local news outlet. In France, a bus driver died after a brutal beating in early July, prompted once again by asking a group of passengers to put on their masks. Florida has reported another record one-day rise in coronavirus numbers, marking 191 deaths from the virus over the past 24 hours. The state\u2019s Republican governor Ron DeSantis, who had been pushing schools to reopen, has backed off in recent days, now saying he wants parents to have \u201cthe choice between in-person and distance learning\u201d for their kids. Two hundred and fifty years after they were stripped of their ancestral homeland, the Esselen tribe of northern California is landless no more. Mario Koran reports: This week, the Esselen tribe finalized the purchase of a 1,200-acre ranch near Big Sur, along California\u2019s north central coast, as part of a $4.5m acquisition that involved the state and an Oregon-based environmental group. The deal will conserve old-growth redwoods and endangered wildlife such as the California condor and red-legged frog, as well as protect the Little Sur River, an important spawning stream for the imperiled steelhead trout. Tribal leaders say they\u2019ll use the land for educational and cultural purposes, building a sweat lodge and traditional village in view of Pico Blanco peak, the center of the tribe\u2019s origin story. Asked about the persistent absence of Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, at Donald Trump\u2019s briefings, the president mused about his health official\u2019s approval rating. Fauci has \u201cgot a very good approval rating and I like that\u201d, Trump told reporters. And Fauci was working with the administration, \u201cso why don\u2019t I have a very high approval rating?\u201d the president wondered out loud. \u201cBut nobody likes me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt can only be my personality, that\u2019s all.\u201d This morning, Fauci was asked about the coronavirus disinformation that Trump has promoted on social media during an interview with ABC. \u201cI don\u2019t tweet, I don\u2019t even read them. I don\u2019t really want to go there,\u201d he told Good Morning America. \u201cI just will continue to do my job, no matter what comes out, because I think it\u2019s very important.\u201d More than 149,000 people have died of coronavirus in the US, according to the tally by Johns Hopkins University. More than 4.3m cases of the virus have been recorded in the country. Los Angeles county has the highest number of cases (176,028), followed by Maricopa county in Arizona, and Miami-Dade in Florida. \u201cI thought she was very impressive,\u201d Trump said of the woman in the disinformation video he promoted. Here\u2019s more background from colleagues Joan E Greve and Martin Pengelly: The video in question featured Dr Stella Immanuel, a physician from Houston, Texas, speaking on the steps of the US Capitol in Washington, surrounded by members of a rightwing doctors\u2019 group. Immanuel made baseless claims about coronavirus, including hailing hydroxychloroquine as a \u201ccure\u201d, even though the drug, which has been repeatedly touted by the president, has not been found to be an effective treatment. The Houston doctor has also dismissed mounting evidence that face masks substantially help limit the spread of coronavirus. Trump abruptly ended the conference after sustained question from CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. Before he walked off, he said he did not know why Twitter and Facebook removed the hydroxychloroquine video he promoted. \u201cI\u2019ve read a lot about hydroxy,\u201d Trump said, and repeated an old refrain that there was no harm in taking the antimalarial drug to treat coronavirus. \u201cI think it could have a very positive impact in the early stages and I don\u2019t think you lose anything by doing it.,\u201d he said. Although hydroxychloroquine is used as a treatment for some conditions, including lupus, studies have not found that the drug can help treat or prevent coronavirus. The US Food and Drug Administration revoked an emergency approval that had allowed doctors to prescribe hydroxychloroquine as an untested treatment for Covid-19. Fact check: Protests and coronavirus The president criticized \u201canarchists\u201d and \u201cagitators\u201d in Portland and pinning the blame for increasing case numbers on protestors. A couple of important points here: 1) The protests in Portland have been mostly peaceful. Journalists have documented demonstrators throwing rocks, water bottles and fireworks at officers, and setting small fires near a federal courthouse. Officers have been documented brutalizing protestors, and five have filed civil lawsuits seeking damages for injuries. 2) Epidemiologists have not conclusively linked the protests following the police killing of George Floyd to the huge spike in cases. The virus is less likely to spread outdoors, especially when people wear masks. The surge in cases across the US came as cities reopened businesses and indoor venues, where the coronavirus transmits more effectively. Doctors have warned that certain police crowd control tactics, including the use of teargas and pepper spray, would exacerbate the spread of disease. Trump discussed his administration\u2019s $765m loan to Eastman Kodak - the camera company - so it can manufacture pharmaceutical ingredients. This is the first investment made by the US International Development Finance Corporation, a foreign investment agency that Trump has assigned to work with the Defense Department to build up the national stockpile of medical supplies. This is the first step in \u201ccreating the greatest medical arsenal in history\u201d the president said. He said the Kodak will create 360 new jobs in Rochester, New York. In May, Trump signed an executive order that gave the DFC the authority to provide loans from funds that Congress\u2019 CARES Act allocated to prop up the Defense Production Act. The House appropriations committee has asked the Government Accountability Office to review the impact of the DFC\u2019s new powers. The agency\u2019s mission has traditionally been to invest in economic development projects aboard, but Trump\u2019s order has redirected the DFC boost manufacturing in the US. \u201cIt\u2019s a breakthrough in bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States,\u201d Trump said. Donald Trump has begun his coronavirus briefing. Per usual, he has started off by invoking a racist phrase to describe the coronavirus. We\u2019re watching, and will blog any important updates, with context. Russian operatives have been spreading disinformation about coronavirus, government officials told the AP: Russian intelligence operatives are using a trio of English-language websites to spread disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, seeking to exploit a crisis that America is struggling to contain ahead of the presidential election in November, U.S. officials said Tuesday. Two Russians who have held senior roles in Moscow\u2019s military intelligence service known as the GRU have been identified as responsible for a disinformation effort directed at American and Western audiences, U.S. government officials said. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The information had previously been classified, but officials said it had been downgraded so they could more freely discuss it. Officials said they were doing so now to sound the alarm about the particular websites and to expose a connection between the sites and Russian intelligence. Between late May and early July, one of the officials said, a trio of websites published about 150 articles about the pandemic response, including coverage aimed at propping up Russia and denigrating the U.S. Among the headlines that caught the attention of U.S. officials are \u201cRussia\u2019s Counter COVID-19 Aid to America Advances Case for D\u00e9tente,\u201d which suggested that Russia had given urgent and substantial aid to the U.S. to fight the pandemic, and \u201cBeijing Believes COVID-19 is a Biological Weapon.\u201d The disclosure comes as the spread of disinformation, including by Russia, is an urgent concern heading into November\u2019s presidential election as U.S. officials look to avoid a repeat of the 2016 contest, when Russia launched a covert social media campaign to divide American public opinion to favor then-candidate Donald Trump. The country\u2019s chief counterintelligence official warned in a public statement Friday about Russia\u2019s continued use of internet trolls to advance their goals. Even apart from politics, the twin crises buffeting the country and much of the world \u2014 the pandemic and race relations and protests \u2014 have offered fertile territory for misinformation or outfight falsehoods. Officials described the disinformation as part of an ongoing and persistent Russian effort to cause confusion. They did not say whether the effort was directly related to the November election, though some of the coverage on the websites appeared to denigrate Trump\u2019s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. The stories call to mind Russian efforts from 2016 to exacerbate race relations in America and drive corruption allegations against U.S. political figures. A new survey of four battleground states has found that more voters support stricter gun laws than maintaining the status quo, and majorities in each state support specific proposals. The Brady Pac, the political arm of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, polled the issue in Iowa, North Carolina, Texas and Colorado, all states with competitive Senate races and a strong culture of gun ownership. The polling, shared first with The Guardian, found that roughly half of voters in these states believe gun laws should be \u201cmore strict\u201d. In all states, more voters prioritize \u201creducing gun violence\u201d over \u201cprotecting the rights of gun owners.\u201d Gun sales have spiked since the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic, amid widespread economic and political uncertainty. The survey found that suburban women, a critical constituency that helped Democrats take the control of the House in 2018, strongly support stronger gun laws. In North Carolina, a state Democrats haven\u2019t captured since the 2008 presidential election, 71% of suburban women said they supported stricter gun laws. Gun control was a top issue for suburban women in 2018. The results match similar surveys that have found growing support for gun control broadly, a concept that once polled at lower levels than individual gun safety proposals, such as requiring safe storage and banning high-capacity ammunition. This also follows a survey commissioned by Everytown for Gun Safety that found messaging around gun-safety was among the most effective in persuading swing voters to support the Democratic nominee Joe Biden in 13 battleground states. Taken together, the polling suggest gun control may not only be an important issue in 2020, but that it could be a decisive issue for a number of swing voters in battleground states that will decide control of the Senate and the White House. Whether or not Donald Trump wins re-election in November, Maryland\u2019s governor, Larry Hogan, predicts the Republican party will finally do some soul searching. That\u2019s the core of the thinking behind Hogan, a popular two-term Republican governor in a reliably Democratic state, strongly floating the idea of running for president himself. \u201cA big part of what I\u2019ve been focusing on for six years is a kind of a bigger tent message and avoiding the divisive rhetoric and avoiding the extremes of either party,\u201d Hogan told the Guardian. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve been so successful as a Republican in one of the bluest states in the country and have had the ability to reach a lot of swing voters and constituencies that Republicans have had a [hard] time reaching.\u201d That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Attorney general William Barr testified before the House judiciary committee. During the hearing, Barr struggled over a question about whether presidents should be allowed to solicit or accept foreign assistance in elections, and he said he did not believe that there is systemic racism in US police departments. Joe Biden criticized Trump for sending federal agents to crack down on anti-racism protests in Portland, Oregon. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about law and order. It\u2019s about a political strategy to revive a failing campaign,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate said in Wilmington, Delaware. \u201cEvery instinct Trump has is to add fuel to the fire. And it\u2019s the last thing, the last thing we need.\u201d The Trump administration will allow \u201cdreamers\u201d to renew deportation protections for a year, after the supreme court blocked the administration\u2019s effort to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. However, the acting homeland security secretary also announced that the department would not accpet new DACA applications. The American Federation of Teachers has authorized \u201csafety strikes\u201d if necessary to protect teachers from coronavirus. The announcement comes as number of school districts in coronavirus hot spots are pushing to reopen schools, despite concerns about the spread of the virus in classrooms. Twitter temporarily restricted Donald Trump Jr\u2019s account for spreading false claims about coronavirus. The president\u2019s son shared a video of a doctor falsely claiming that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is a \u201ccure\u201d for coronavirus. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. A CBS News reporter asked Joe Biden if he is running for president specifically to defeat Trump or to enact his own policy agenda. \u201cI\u2019m running because Trump is the president, and I think our democracy\u2019s at stake, for real,\u201d Biden replied. The Democratic candidate acknowledged that many American voters consider him to be \u201cthe antithesis of Trump,\u201d and he agrees with that assessment. A number of polls indicate a substantial portion of Biden\u2019s supporters view their votes for the Democrat to be more so votes against Trump, but as Biden\u2019s answer indicates, that is also how he has structured much of his campaign pitch. Joe Biden criticized the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to instill fear in Americans about the alleged dangers of a Democratic administration. The Trump campaign has run anti-Biden ads featuring a 911 call going unanswered, as the president falsely accuses his Democratic opponent of supporting the movement to defund the police. Biden said Trump was trying to craft a \u201cbizarre law and order\u201d campaign message in order to \u201ctry to scare the devil out of the American people.\u201d Joe Biden is taking reporters\u2019 questions in Wilmington, and the first question was unsurprisingly about his vice presidential selection process. A CNN reporter asked Biden whether he still intended to announce his choice of running mate in early August, as he previously indicated. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a choice in the first week in August,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd I promise, I\u2019ll let you know when I do.\u201d When asked whether he would be able to meet with his running mate in person considering concerns about coronavirus, Biden said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Biden has pledged to choose a woman as his running mate, and California senator Kamala Harris is widely considered the frontrunner at the moment. But the former vice president is also hosting a virtual fundraiser with senator Elizabeth Warren on Friday, and he was seen speaking to congresswoman Karen Bass yesterday. Joe Biden is now delivering remarks about the fourth plank of his \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d economic recovery plan in Wilmington, Delaware. The Democratic presidential candidate opened his remarks by noting he spoke to John Lewis in the final days of the civil rights icon\u2019s life. Biden called on the Senate to pass the Voting Rights Act in order to honor the legacy of Lewis, who is lying in state at the US Capitol today. Biden then moved on to sharply criticizing Trump for his decision to send federal agents to Portland, Oregon, to crack down on recent protests against racism and police brutality. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about law and order,\u201d Biden said, referencing the catchphrase Trump frequently uses to condemn the protesters. \u201cIt\u2019s about a political strategy to revive a failing campaign.\u201d Biden added, \u201cEvery instinct Trump has is to add fuel to the fire. And it\u2019s the last thing, the last thing we need.\u201d Moments ago at the House judiciary committee hearing, Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal accused attorney general William Barr of setting a double standard for protesters based on political ideology. Jayapal noted Trump previously threatened to \u201cactivate\u201d Barr to \u201cdominate\u201d the protesters who have marched against racism and police brutality since the killing of George Floyd. Yet the president did not pledge similar action when Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer was facing threats over her coronavirus shutdown order, Jayapal noted. Some of those anti-shutdown protesters swarmed the Michigan capitol with guns. \u201cWhen white men with swastikas storm a government building with guns, there is no need for the president to \u2018activate\u2019 you, because they\u2019re getting the president\u2019s personal agenda done,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cBut when black people and people of color protest police brutality, systemic racism and the president\u2019s very own lack of response to those critical issues, then you forcibly remove them with armed federal officers [and] pepper bombs because they are considered terrorists by the president.\u201d Barr indicated he was not aware of the threats against Whitmer. \u201cThere are a lot of protests around the United States,\u201d Barr said. But Jayapal noted Barr was \u201cvery aware\u201d of certain protests in the country, such as those taking place in Portland, Oregon. Barr has defended the actions of federal agents in Portland by arguing they are protecting a federal courthouse in the city. However, it\u2019s worth noting the anti-shutdown protests in Michigan that Jayapal mentioned took place across the street from the Charles E Chamberlain federal building, raising questions about why those demonstrations didn\u2019t cause similar concern for Barr. According to the Washington Post, the White House insisted on the money for the new FBI headquarters being included in the next coronavirus relief bill. The Post reports: When the White House first proposed inserting money on the FBI building in the legislation and conditioning it on keeping the headquarters in Washington, Republican lawmakers blocked it from being in the bill, people familiar with the discussions said. But White House officials persisted in demanding the money and it ended up back in the legislation. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has now said he would move to strip the provision out of the relief bill after Democratic senators speculated that the proposal was meant to benefit the president\u2019s business. Over in the Senate, majority leader Mitch McConnell said he is opposed to including money for the new FBI headquarters in the next coronavirus relief bill. A draft of the Republican relief bill includes $1.75 billion for a new FBI headquarters in Washington, which has been a priority for Trump since he took office. Before the president\u2019s inauguration, the FBI planned to move its headquarters to the DC suburbs, which would open up a large piece of real estate near Trump\u2019s Washington hotel. Democrats have accused Trump of trying to block the FBI from moving its headquarters in order to prevent other hotel companies from buying the property and thus creating competition for his company. Republicans expressed surprise that the unrelated proposal was included in the coronavirus relief bill. \u201cThat smells like a kind of strange addition,\u201d Republican senator Ron Johnson said. McConnell has now said he wants extraneous items, including the money for the FBI headquarters, stripped from the bill. After attorney general William Barr stumbled over a question about soliciting foreign election assistance, a commissioner of the Federal Election Commission weighed in on the issue. FEC commissioner Ellen Weintraub reshared a memo from June of last year condemning foreign assistance, saying of the memo, \u201cI would not have thought that I would need to keep saying this.\u201d Weintraub\u2019s memo reads in part, \u201cLet me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office: It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election.\u201d Over at the House judiciary committee hearing, attorney general William Barr had another tense exchange with a Democratic member of the panel. Congressman David Cicilline noted that the Republican-led Senate intelligence committee concluded Russia interfered in the 2016 US elections, and Barr said he agreed with that conclusion. Cicilline then asked Barr, \u201cIs it ever appropriate, sir, for the president to solicit or accept foreign assistance in an election?\u201d After a pause, Barr responded, \u201cIt depends what kind of assistance.\u201d That answer was notable considering Trump was impeached by the House over allegations that he attempted to pressure Ukraine to intervene in the 2020 presidential race to benefit his reelection bid. Cicilline repeated, \u201cIs it ever appropriate for the president or presidential candidate to accept or solicit foreign assistance of any kind in his or her election?\u201d Barr then acknowledged, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d Acting homeland security secretary Chad Wolf confirmed in a statement that DACA recipients would be allowed to renew deportation protections for one year. \u201cAs the Department continues looking at the policy and considers future action, the fact remains that Congress should act on this matter,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThere are important policy reasons that may warrant the full rescission of the DACA policy.\u201d The statement said the department would not consider new DACA applications but would \u201climit the period of renewed deferred action granted pursuant to the DACA policy after the issuance of this memorandum to one year.\u201d The policy guarantees DACA will remain in place until after the presidential election in November. The Trump administration reportedly plans to allow \u201cdreamers\u201d to extend deportation protections for a year as the federal government seeks to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The news comes a month after the supreme court blocked the administration\u2019s effort to end the Obama-era program. Reuters reports: The administration is preparing a fresh attempt to end the program that shields from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants living in the United States illegally after entering as children - a group often called \u2018Dreamers.\u2019 ... The administration plans to continue its existing policy of not accepting new DACA applicants, a policy in place since 2017, [a senior administration official] told Reuters. But the administration will extend the eligibility by a year for those DACA immigrants whose protection from deportation was due to expire, as long as they do not have a criminal record, the official said. \u2018For anyone who refiles, if they are eligible and were set to expire, we will renew them on a case by case basis into the next year for an extension,\u2019 the official said. That policy would allow DACA to remain in place until after the November election. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has vowed to make the program permanent if he is elected. Attorney general William Barr claimed he does not read the president\u2019s tweets, during a tense exchange about Trump\u2019s commutation of Roger Stone\u2019s sentence. Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell asked Barr if he was investigating the commutation. When Barr said no, Swalwell asked, \u201cWhy not?\u201d Barr replied, \u201cWhy should I?\u201d Swalwell went on to recount some of the events surrounding Stone\u2019s conviction and eventual commutation. The congressman quoted a Trump tweet from December 2018, in which the president said Stone had \u201cshown guts\u201d by not testifying against him. Barr said he was not familiar with the tweet. \u201cYou don\u2019t read the president\u2019s tweets?\u201d Swalwell asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Barr responded. Swalwell replied, \u201cWell, there\u2019s a lot of evidence in the president\u2019s tweets, Mr Attorney General. I think you should start reading them.\u201d Barr is clearly familiar with at least some of Trump\u2019s tweets because he said earlier this year that the president should stop tweeting about the justice department because it makes it \u201cimpossible for me to do my job.\u201d Florida has reported its highest single-day death toll from Covid-19 since the pandemic began, with 186 deaths reported, bringing total deaths in the state to 6,117. The state health department has also confirmed 9,230 new cases, bringing the state\u2019s known total to 441,977. The way Florida collects statistics means the 186 deaths reported on Tuesday did not necessarily all happen on Monday. According to Johns Hopkins University, more than 4.3m cases and more than 148,000 deaths have been recorded in the US as a whole. That source puts Florida second in total cases confirmed, behind California, an early hotspot now experiencing a resurgence. Under Governor Ron DeSantis, known to some as \u201cmini Trump\u201d, Florida is among largely Republican-led southern and western states which sought to reopen their economies over the Memorial Day weekend in late May and which are now struggling to cope. Late last week Dr Mark Supino of Jackson Memorial Hospital\u2019s emergency department, in Miami, told the Guardian: \u201cThe last three weeks have been some of the busiest shifts in my entire life. We\u2019ve seen some of the sickest patients we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Florida has lost the Republican national convention but its governor has insisted it remains open for business: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to restrict the businesses,\u201d DeSantis said last Thursday. As the presidential election approaches, most national and battleground state polling has shown growing disapproval for Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Polling averages for Florida show Joe Biden with a healthy lead. The House judiciary committee hearing with attorney general William Barr has now resumed after a very brief recess. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Barr said he does not generally believe there is systemic racism in US police departments. Under questioning from Democratic congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Barr said, \u201cI don\u2019t agree there is systemic racism in police departments generally in this country.\u201d The American Federation of Teachers has authorized \u201csafety strikes\u201d if necessary to protect teachers from coronavirus. The announcement comes as number of school districts in coronavirus hot spots are pushing to reopen schools, despite concerns about the spread of the virus in classrooms. Twitter temporarily restricted Donald Trump Jr\u2019s account for spreading false claims about coronavirus. The president\u2019s son shared a video of a doctor falsely claiming that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is a \u201ccure\u201d for coronavirus. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: Senate Republicans did not allocate any money in the latest Covid-19 relief bill to support election officials as they prepare to run an unprecedented election this fall. States need at least $4bn to upgrade their systems, according to an estimate to the Brennan Center for Justice. Congress has allocated just $400m, so far. There have been widespread and bipartisan calls for federal assistance to local election officials, who are grappling with how they can accommodate expected high turnout in the presidential election. More Americans are expected to vote by mail this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, and election officials in states that typically do not see widespread absentee voting are figuring out how they can scale up their systems to process ballot requests as well as ballots themselves. During the primaries, voters in many states have seen severe delays in getting their ballots as local election offices, in some cases staffed by just a few full-time employees, have been crushed by the surge of requests. \u201cThe Senate proposal is an insult to the lives we have lost to this global pandemic and to those who continue to suffer. It is a morally deficient response that does not support our most marginalized communities and protect our democratic institutions,\u201d Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which has lobbied for more support for mail-in voting, said in a statement. Covid-19 is also forcing election officials to find poll workers and places for polling stations as the people who usually serve - and tend to skew older - and locations drop out because of the virus. Tina Barton, an election official in Rochester Hills, Michigan, told the Guardian last week she was \u201cbegging\u201d people to work the polls and had recently spent $2,000 on an advertisement encouraging people to sign up to be poll workers. Senator Amy Klobuchar, who has led a push for expansion of vote by mail in recent weeks, also criticized the Republican proposal, describing it as an \u201coutrage.\u201d Moments ago, attorney general William Barr defended his widely criticized handling of criminal cases involving the president\u2019s former associates, such as Michael Flynn and Roger Stone. \u201cI agree the president\u2019s friends don\u2019t deserve special breaks, but they also don\u2019t deserve to be treated more harshly than other people,\u201d Barr said. However, as a Washington Post reporter noted, it would be difficult if not impossible to think of another instance when the justice department moved to dismiss charges against someone who had twice pleaded guilty, as happened in the case of Flynn. Attorney general Wiliam Barr said he does not generally believe there is systemic racism in US police departments. Democratic congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas questioned Barr on whether he considered the killing of George Floyd to be indicative of a systemic problem in policing. Amid crosstalk between Lee and Barr, the attorney general said, \u201cI don\u2019t agree there is systemic racism in police departments generally in this country.\u201d Barr also noted he is opposed to eliminating qualified immunity, which protects police officers from being held legally liable in civil court for misconduct. The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) has authorized local teachers unions to conduct \u201csafety strikes\u201d as a last resort, if local officials do not meet safety criteria to protect teachers from coronavirus. School districts are being pushed to open, even in areas where the coronavirus outbreak is severe, such as Florida. The authorization will give local unions another bargaining chip as school districts across the Sun Belt \u2013 where Covid-19 is spreading widely \u2013 are scheduled to open in early to mid-August. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear,\u201d president of the AFT Randi Weingarten told delegates at the union\u2019s annual conference, which is being held online this year. \u201cJust as we have done with our healthcare workers, we will fight on all fronts for the safety of our students and their educators. But if the authorities don\u2019t get it right, and they don\u2019t protect the safety and health of those we represent and those we serve, nothing is off the table \u2014 not advocacy or protests, negotiations, grievances or lawsuits, or, if necessary as a last resort, safety strikes.\u201d The 1.7 million-member union represents both teachers and nurses across the country, and it is the nation\u2019s second-largest union for educators. This month, in an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Weingarten said, \u201cIt\u2019s as if Trump and [education secretary Betsy] DeVos want to create chaos and want to jeopardize reopening. ... There\u2019s no other reason why they would be this reckless, this callous, this cruel\u201d. The union has pushed Congress to fund billions in safety upgrades for schools to improve ventilations and provide personal protective equipment, among other safeguards. Among the union\u2019s demands: mandatory masks for teachers and students, enhanced cleaning regiments, and smaller class sizes to enforce social distancing measures. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler pressed attorney general William Barr on whether he had ever discussed the presidential election with Trump or one of his advisers. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into my discussions with the president,\u201d Barr replied. The attorney general noted he and Trump had not discussed the election in relation to the justice department program that Barr was focused on during today\u2019s hearing. When asked whether he has discussed the election generally with the president or one of his advisers, Barr said, \u201cI\u2019m a member of the cabinet, and there\u2019s an election going on. Obviously the topic comes up.\u201d He added, \u201cThe topic comes up in cabinet meetings and other things. It shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that the topic of the election comes up.\u201d Nadler responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t say I was surprised. I just asked if you\u2019d done that.\u201d The Democratic chairman succeeded in getting Barr to admit he had discussed the election, but Daniel Goldman, the former impeachment counsel for House Democrats, said Nadler\u2019s line of questioning was \u201cineffective.\u201d In his opening statement, attorney general William Barr acknowledged incidents of racism against African Americans but declined to characterize such events as the consequence of systemic raicsm. Barr said the death of George Floyd, who was killed after a white police officer kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes, had \u201cunderstandably jarred the whole country and forced us to reflect on longstanding issues in our nation.\u201d But the attorney general added, \u201cAt the same time, I think it would be an oversimplification to treat the problem as rooted in some deep-seated racism generally infecting our police departments. It seems far more likely that the problem stems from a complex mix of factors, which can be addressed with focused attention over time.\u201d Barr went on to criticize the \u201cviolent rioters and anarchists [who] have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction on innocent victims,\u201d echoing Trump\u2019s words about the protesters who have been marching against racism and police brutality since the killing of Floyd. \u201cThe demonization of police is not only unfair and inconsistent with the principle that all people should be treated as individuals, but gravely injurious to our inner city communities,\u201d Barr said. \u201cThere is no harder job in America today than being a police officer.\u201d Interestingly, Barr skipped a section of his prepared remarks released last night, which bemoaned \u201cthe grave abuses involved in the bogus \u2018Russiagate\u2019 scandal.\u201d After Republican congressman Jim Jordan\u2019s lengthy video of recent protests concluded, Democratic chairman Jerry Nadler quipped, \u201cWell, I hope that Mr Jordan will never complain about the length of my opening statement.\u201d Nadler then noted Jordan did not give the committee the required 48-hour notice about audiovisual aids used during hearings. With that, Nadler swore in attorney general William Barr, about 35 minutes after the start of the hearing. Congressman Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, used his opening statement to criticize the origins of the justice department\u2019s Russia investigation. \u201cSpying. That one word, that\u2019s why they\u2019re after you, Mr Attorney General,\u201d Jordan said to William Barr. He went on to go through a now-familiar list of complaints about the justice department\u2019s handling of the investigation. Jordan then played a lengthy video of recent protests against racism and police brutality, meant to justify the deployment of federal troops to Democratic-controlled cities. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler used his opening statement to thoroughly rebuke attorney general William Barr for his leadership of the justice department. \u201cYour tenure has been marked by a persistent war against the department\u2019s professional core in an apparent attempt to secure favors for the president,\u201d Nadler said. The Democratic chairman outlined several examples of this \u201cwar,\u201d specifically criticizing Barr for \u201cactively seeking out conflict with American citizens\u201d who are protesting for civil rights. The hearing comes as Trump\u2019s administration continues to receive criticism for sending federal troops to crack down on anti-racism protests in Portland, Oregon. \u201cIn your time at the department, you have aided and abetted the worst failings of this president,\u201d Nadler said. The House judiciary committee hearing featuring testimony from attorney general William Barr has now started. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler gaveled in the hearing and confirmed the event was slightly delayed because of his \u201cminor car accident\u201d this morning. \u201cEveryone is fine, except perhaps the car, but it did cause significant delay,\u201d Nadler joked. Nadler noted this marks Barr\u2019s first House testimony since becoming Trump\u2019s attorney general early last year. The hearing on oversight of the justice department is expected to include Democrats grilling Barr on the forcible removal of peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square last month and last month\u2019s firing of the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Attorney general William Barr has arrived on Capitol Hill to testify before the House judiciary committee. The hearing was originally scheduled to begin at 10am ET, but it was slightly delayed after judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler was in a minor car accident. (Nadler was not driving and not injured, his spokesperson said.) Barr\u2019s opening remarks, which were released last night, indicate he intends to come out swinging against Democrats, who are expected to press him on the forcible removal of peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square near the White House last month. Democratic members of the committee are also likely to ask Barr about last month\u2019s firing of the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan. In his prepared opening remarks, Barr says, \u201cEver since I made it clear that I was going to do everything I could to get to the bottom of the grave abuses involved in the bogus \u2018Russiagate\u2019 scandal, many of the Democrats on this Committee have attempted to discredit me by conjuring up a narrative that I am simply the President\u2019s factotum who disposes of criminal cases according to his instructions.\u201d This hearing marks Barr\u2019s first appearance before the House judicary committee since becoming Trump\u2019s attorney general in February of last year. Twitter\u2019s communications team reiterated that it has not permanently suspended Donald Trump Jr\u2019s account after the president\u2019s son shared false information about coronavirus. The Twitter team said in a tweet, \u201cThis account has not been permanently suspended. Per the screenshot, the Tweet requires deletion because it violates our rules (sharing misinformation on COVID-19), and the account will have limited functionality for 12 hours.\u201d Donald Trump Jr\u2019s Twitter account was restricted after he reshared a video of Dr Stella Immanuel, who has made a number of baseless claims about coronavirus. Immanuel has hailed hydroxychloroquine as a \u201ccure\u201d for coronavirus, even though the anti-malaria drug has not been found to be an effective treatment against the virus. The Houston doctor has also dismissed mounting evidence that face masks substantially help to limit the spread of coronavirus. The Daily Beast has more on Immanuel: Immanuel, a pediatrician and a religious minister, has a history of making bizarre claims about medical topics and other issues. She has often claimed that gynecological problems like cysts and endometriosis are in fact caused by people having sex in their dreams with demons and witches. She alleges alien DNA is currently used in medical treatments, and that scientists are cooking up a vaccine to prevent people from being religious. And, despite appearing in Washington, D.C. to lobby Congress on Monday, she has said that the government is run in part not by humans but by \u2018reptilians\u2019 and other aliens. According to a New York Times reporter, Twitter quibbled with the characterization that it had \u201csuspended\u201d Donald Trump Jr\u2019s account. The social media giant said it had only required the president\u2019s son to delete a tweet with false claims about coronavirus and limited some account features for 12 hours. Twitter limited some of Donald Trump Jr\u2019s account features after the president\u2019s son reshared false claims about the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment. According to a screenshot shared by an adviser to Trump, Twitter concluded that he had violated its policy on spreading \u201cmisleading and potentially harmful\u201d information about coronavirus. The news comes after Trump shared a video of a doctor falsely touting hydroxychloroquine as a \u201ccure\u201d for coronavirus. The viral video, which was also retweeted by the president, was taken down by Twitter. Hydroxychloroquine is not considered an effective treatment against coronavirus, and the Food and Drug Administration revoked its emergency use authorization as a potential treatment last month. Dr Anthony Fauci said of the drug in an interview this morning, \u201cThe overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.\u201d Today\u2019s House hearing with attorney general William Barr has reportedly been slightly delayed because judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler was in a minor car accident on his way from New York. A spokesperson for Nadler told CNN the Democratic congressman was not driving and was not injured in the accident. However, the incident has slightly delayed the hearing on justice department oversight, which was set to start in about 15 minutes at 10 am ET. The hearing is now expected to begin at 10:45 am ET. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany just announced Trump will hold a coronavirus briefing today at 5 pm ET. The president resumed the briefings last week, nearly three months after he suspended the daily events. The initial decision to suspend the briefings came shortly after Trump dangerously suggested that Americans could protect themselves from coronavirus by ingesting disinfectants, prompting warnings from some state health officials not to do so. In last week\u2019s briefings, the president did not reiterate that false claim, and he strongly urged Americans to wear face masks after months of refusing to do so. However, the president went on a Twitter spree last night that reshared false claims about the use of hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment. Trump will almost certainly be asked about those claims today, so it should be a rather interesting briefing. The Black Lives Matter mural painted outside Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan has been vandalized for at least the fourth time. In the latest incident, Mark David Hutt, a 32-year-old resident of Rochester, New York, tossed white paint over part of the stencil and smeared it with his hands, according to the New York Police Department. Hutt was arrested and charged with criminal mischief. Whilst the NYPD doesn\u2019t track the number of times the mural has been defaced, three separate incidents have previously been reported. The mural, which lies outside the Trump Organization\u2019s headquarters, was first vandalized about four days after it was painted on July 9. In that incident, red paint was used paint over V in \u201cLives.\u201d Donald Trump has called the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d a \u201csymbol of hate\u201d. In a tweet before the sign was approved by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Trump said a \u201cbig, expensive, yellow Black Lives Matter sign\u201d would be \u201cdenigrating [to] this luxury Avenue.\u201d The mayor responded: \u201cHere\u2019s what you don\u2019t understand: Black people BUILT 5th Ave and so much of this nation. Your \u2018luxury\u2019 came from THEIR labor, for which they have never been justly compensated. We are honoring them. The fact that you see it as denigrating your street is the definition of racism.\u201d In his \u201cGood Morning America\u201d interview today, Dr Anthony Fauci also corrected false claims reshared by the president that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is a \u201ccure\u201d for coronavirus. GMA host George Stephanopoulos noted the Food and Drug Administration revoked its emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment last month. \u201cI go along with the FDA,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThe overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.\u201d The infectious disease expert also made clear he does not pay too much attention to Trump\u2019s Twitter feed, which was particularly active last night. One tweet reshared by the president accused Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, of having \u201cmisled the American public.\u201d Asked about the tweets this morning, Fauci said, \u201cI don\u2019t tweet. I don\u2019t even read them, so I don\u2019t really want to go there. I just will continue to do my job no matter what comes out because I think it\u2019s very important.\u201d He later added, \u201cI have not been misleading the American public under any circumstances.\u201d Good morning, live blog readers, and greetings from Washington. Donald Trump sent a flurry of tweets last night, resharing messages accusing Dr Anthony Fauci of misleading the country on coronavirus treatments and videos of a doctor falsely claiming that hydroxychloroquine is a \u201ccure\u201d for the virus. \u201cDr. Fauci has misled the American public on many issues, but in particular, on dismissing #hydroxychloroquine and calling Remdesivir the new gold standard,\u201d the retweet said. Twitter later took down the videos of the doctor making false claims about hyroxychloroquine, citing their rules on spreading misinformation. Trump\u2019s defensive Twitter spree came as the US coronavirus death toll approaches 150,000. The country\u2019s daily death toll has also recently been on the rise because of many states\u2019 surges in new cases. But public health experts, including Fauci, say they remain committed to educating the public about mitigating the spread of the virus, even as the president seems determined to downplay the severity of the threat. When asked this morning by ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos how he can continue to do his job while the president undermines his credibility, Fauci replied, \u201cYou know, George, I don\u2019t know how to address that. I\u2019m just going to certainly continue doing my job.\u201d Here\u2019s what else is happening today: Trump has no events on his public schedule, which should give him plenty more time to tweet. Joe Biden will speak in Wilmington, Delaware, about the fourth plank of his \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d economic recovery plan for working families and how it will address systemic racism at 2.30 pm ET. Attorney general William Barr will testify at a House judiciary committee hearing on justice department oversight at 10 am ET. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
