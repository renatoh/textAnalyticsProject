The chain, which has seen its sales dive, is closing its subsidiaries in mainland Europe and shutting its Direct catalogue business. The move will mean 3,350 job losses in Europe, and just over 1,000 in the UK, including 350 at the company's head office on Baker Street, Marylebone, central London. M&amp;S chairman and chief executive Luc Vandevelde unveiled the cuts as he launched a strategy to turnaround the retailer's fortunes. He said M&amp;S needed to be a \"simpler, more focused\" organisation. The group is also selling off its Kings Super Markets and Brooks Brothers subsidiaries in the United States. Mr Vandevelde said M&amp;S would concentrate on putting in place a plan to revive its clothing ranges, and would expand in its growing product areas of food and home and beauty. \"These changes put in place a clear, thorough and urgent plan for recovery based on the UK business,\" he said. \"At the heart is a determination to restore an unquestioned reputation with our customers for quality, value, service and innovation.\" Mr Vandevelde said M&amp;S would be \"giving up our operations in Europe\". \"Two thirds of our stores will be refurbished within two years, \" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \"It [M&amp;S] will be very different. It will be a company completely focused on its customers in the UK.\" He rejected a suggestion that the moves were a panic measure, saying: \"It's a measure of determination. We want to give our company the best chance to succeed.\" Mr Vandevelde said M&amp;S total UK retail sales had increased by just 0.8% in the nine weeks to March 24. Like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new store sales, fell, however, by 0.5% over the same period. The launch of the strategy comes just months after Roger Holmes started work as managing director at M&amp;S. He joined the group last year from Kingfisher, where he ran Woolworths. Mr Holmes has been conducting a review of the UK business ever since with Mr Vandevelde.
