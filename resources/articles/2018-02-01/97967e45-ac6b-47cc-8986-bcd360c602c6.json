The long-awaited proposals would fulfill Trump\u2019s campaign promise to protect the US steel industry from foreign competition, particularly from China. They are also likely to spark threats of retaliation. The reviews suggest imposing tariff options of at least 24% on all steel products from all countries, and at least 7.7% on all aluminum products from all countries. Brazil, China, Russia, South Korea, South Africa and Vietnam were among the countries specifically mentioned in the review. The reviews were presented to Trump last month after complaints by US producers that foreign dumping of the two metals was shutting them out of business. Trump authorized the probes under a 1962 trade law that has not been invoked since 2001. The US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross emphasized that Trump would have the final say, including on whether to exempt certain countries, such as Nato allies, from any actions. Trump has until April 11 to announce his decision on steel import curbs and by April 20 to decide on aluminum restrictions. \u201cThe president has the discretion to modify any of these or to come with something totally different,\u201d he told reporters. Steel stocks soared on the recommendations. Ross said he would not be surprised if countries challenged the measures at the World Trade Organization. He said \u201cthere has been no dialing back\u201d of the recommendations due to objections from industries that use steel and aluminum. \u201cThe objective of both reports is to get the production up to a level which will result, in our judgment, in the long term viability of each industry,\u201d Ross said, adding that he did not believe that the recommendations would lead to significant price hikes. US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he hoped the proposals \u201care the beginning of efforts by this administration to finally get tough on China\u201d. Some US companies will be able to request exclusions for specific products if the US lacks sufficient domestic capacity or for national security considerations, Ross added. Trump met with a bipartisan group of US senators and congresspeople at the White House last week, signaling he would take at least some action to restrict imports of the two metals. Some US lawmakers and steel and aluminum users have urged caution in any restrictions to avoid disruptions or price spikes in the raw materials, used in everything from autos to appliances and aircraft and construction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
