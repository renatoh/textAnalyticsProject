There has been a clamour for Tomkins, the Super League young player of the year, to be selected for the match at Wigan, with the former internationals Alex Murphy and Mike Stephenson among those calling for his inclusion. But the 20-year-old was overlooked for the opening Four Nations clash against France despite scoring a hat-trick against Wales the week before, and Offiah, a former England winger, believes Smith may stick with the playmakers that helped England overturn a half-time deficit last week. \"There have been a lot of calls for him to play after his performance against Wales,\" said Offiah, who as an agent acts for the England prospects Richie Myler and Kyle Eastmond, who both faced France. \"We are blessed in that position at the moment with Danny McGuire and Richie Myler, plus Kyle Eastmond, who did well in coming off the bench. \"I would imagine he [Tomkins] will figure at some point in this Four Nations, but I'm not sure that Smith will throw him in against Australia in such an important game. I couldn't understand why he wouldn't pick him against France and then play him against Australia, but I suppose it could happen. \"This is the youngest side we've had for a number of years, and it's a big test for them. A lot of pressure will be riding on the young players such as Ryan Hall, Michael Shenton and Richie Myler. I was a little bit worried before we played France because of the number of young players, and that might be a factor for Sam.\" Smith will name his team at lunchtime , with Myler available despite being concussed in a high tackle from the French centre Jean-Philippe Baile during the closing stages of Friday's match at Doncaster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
