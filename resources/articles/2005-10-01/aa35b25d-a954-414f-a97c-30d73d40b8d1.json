Kieren Fallon rides the Tote's 11-10 favourite, and O'Brien has booked Johnny Murtagh for Dylan Thomas, the 8-1 third favourite. The champion-elect Jamie Spencer, partnering Arabian Prince, will be having only his fourth ride for the stable since being replaced by Fallon at Ballydoyle this season. Colm O'Donoghue is on the O'Brien outsider Mountain. John Gosden's Leo will now go for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile on Saturday week instead, leaving a field of nine for the \u00a3216,000 Doncaster prize that may well decide the trainers' title. Sir Michael Stoute has a six-figure lead over O'Brien and runs his Leicester maiden winner Best Alibi, who was supplemented for \u00a317,500. Mark Johnston will saddle the 9-4 second favourite Winged Cupid, winner of his two starts, while the Kevin Ryan-trained Palace Episode makes a quick reappearance after his Dewhurst fifth. Racing Post Trophy (Tote ante-post): 11-10 Septimus, 9-4 Winged Cupid, 8 Dylan Thomas, 11 Best Alibi, 14 Arabian Prince, 16 Kilworth, 20 Palace Episode, 22 Hazeymm, 33 Mountain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
