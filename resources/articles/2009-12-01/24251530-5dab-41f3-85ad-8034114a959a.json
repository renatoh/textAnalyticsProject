He told MPs Labour has adhered to its greatest golden rule \u2013 that it cannot be trusted with voters' money \u2013 after Alistair Darling announced a 0.5p rise in national insurance. \"Every family in the country is going to be forced to pay for years for this prime minister's mistakes,\" he said, highlighting the increase in national insurance contributions (NIC) that will raise \u00a33bn a year. This will be imposed in April 2011 on anyone earning more than \u00a320,000 and is on top of the 0.5p increase from 2011 already announced in the budget earlier this year. Osborne added: \"At the end of their period in office they have indeed adhered to the greatest of golden rules: never trust a Labour government with your money again.\" In a sign that the Conservatives will reprise their 1992 \"tax bombshell\" campaign against Labour, Osborne said that the increase in NIC showed that Labour party was abandoning aspirational voters. \"All that work they did to drag their party on to the centre ground of British politics, all the efforts they made to persuade the country they were for enterprise and aspiration, all that is gone,\" he said. \"Instead they've erected a sign over the country saying 'closed for enterprise and wealth creation'.\" Osborne mocked Darling. \"Today, confronted with the biggest budget deficit in our peacetime history, he faced a choice. Would he take the tough spending decisions before the general election or would he completely duck them? We were promised a pre-budget report and what we got was a pre-election report. They have lost all the moral authority to govern today,\" he said. Labour had deferred outlining its detailed spending plans and had introduced the NIC increase to offer limited guarantees on ringfencing in some areas of health, education and policing, Osborne claimed. \"The chancellor is prepared to tell us what he will spend money on but stays almost totally silent on where the real axe will fall. He is achieving the previously impossible trick of ringfencing a black hole.\" The lack of a comprehensive spending review amounted to a \"massive missing piece\", Osborne said. \"Lavish detail on the few things they say they are protecting, almost nothing on the many things they are planning to cut. They are not being honest with the British people about the real price of their incompetence.\" Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, criticised the NICS increase on the grounds that it would not be used to cut the fiscal deficit. \"None of this increase in taxation is going to be used to pay down the borrowing requirement or the deficit, it is complete distortion of the priorities the government should have,\" he said. Cable added: \"The economic position of the country is still very grave. We know that we are 5% poorer than we were year ago and government estimates of borrowing this year and next year are higher than even they had forecast. What we needed was a national economic plan and what we got is an election manifesto. There have been genuinely great Labour chancellors in the past \u2013 [Richard] Stafford Cripps, Roy Jenkins, amongst others \u2013 and they would not have been obsessed, as the chancellor is today, with drawing tactical dividing lines.\" \u2022 The sub-heading of this article was amended on Thursday 10 December 2009 to include Vince Cable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
