I'd never considered that before, particularly as I'm extremely girly in my outlook, but on reflection she had a point. I work in IT support at Kimberly Clark in Brighton. We have about 400 users and, as the only techie, I'm solely responsible for sorting out any problems that arise. It's pretty manic, but no two days are the same and being able to fix people's glitches always makes me happy. My passion for drumming started a few years ago when I saw a video by the band Feeder which featured loads of female drummers looking extraordinarily sexy. I remember thinking \"I'd love to do that\" before I walked away and forgot all about it. Then, a couple of years ago I saw an ad in a shop window offering drum lessons and everything went from there. My teacher put me in touch with a friend who was looking for a drummer to join his band, Only. Despite my lack of experience, and my very obvious nerves, they took me on as the fourth member. Right now, we're doing a lot of gigging around Brighton and we're also recording an EP. Our music's hard to categorise but we're influenced by bands such as the Cure, Radiohead and Interpol. Before we go on stage I'm totally incapable of even holding a conversation but once I'm up there I love every minute. Watching the crowd get into it is the best feeling in the world. Drumming gets easier the more instinctive it becomes. It's like trying to rub your stomach and tap your head at the same time - if you think too hard about it you can get into trouble. To keep up to scratch, I still have lessons twice a month - I'm up to grade four at the moment and last year I bought myself a top-of-the-range Rowland TD 20 drum kit. It's the first thing I see when I wake up in the morning and it never fails to put a smile on my face. I met my boyfriend at the first gig we did. We were supporting his band and he came over to chat. His opening line was \"You're the sexiest drummer I've ever seen\". I guess those Feeder fantasies finally came true.
