The 28-year-old second-row should become a Bradford player by Friday provided he passes a medical on the biceps injury that saw him withdraw from New Zealand's Tri-Nations squad. Solomona had two years left to run on his contract. Wakefield claim the player was unsettled by the promise of more money but have reluctantly agreed to his transfer request. The Bradford back-row forward Brett Ferres, 20, who is currently playing for England in the Federation Shield, will join Wakefield as part of the deal. Ferres, who made 30 appearances for Bradford this season, is the nephew of the Wakefield chief executive, Steve Ferres. Although Wakefield will welcome the transfer fee for Solomona, their coach, John Kear, knows that finding an equivalent replacement for the Kiwi will be very tough. Bradford, on the other hand, still have cash to spend following the record \u00a3450,000 transfer of Stuart Fielden to Wigan earlier this year. Last night the Bulls were playing down concerns about the RFL investigation. \"The two clubs have reached agreement on the terms,\" said the Bradford chairman, Peter Hood. \"I see no reason why it shouldn't happen. It's just a question of signatures on the paperwork. The only problem is that the player's agent is in Vietnam, the player is in New Zealand and Steve McNamara [the Bradford coach] is in Mexico.\" New Zealand have made several changes to their side for Saturday's match with Great Britain. Bradford's Shontayne Hape suffered a knee ligament injury in last weekend's defeat by Australia and is replaced on the wing by Brisbane's Tame Tupou. Steve Matai is also injured, forcing the coach, Brian McClennan, to shift Nigel Vagana to centre and play Jerome Ropati at stand-off. Hull's Motu Tony and St Helens' Jason Cayless have been named on the replacements bench. The Swinton forward Ian Sinfield, the brother of Leeds' captain, Kevin Sinfield, has been called into the Scotland squad for Sunday's World Cup qualifier against Wales in Bridgend. Sinfield gets his chance because of injury to the Widnes forward Oliver Wilkes. Lee Briers has returned from Australia, where he played for Great Britain in Friday's warm-up match in Newcastle, in time to captain the Welsh side. Relegated Castleford have signed the Samoan international Mark Leafa, an ever-present in Leigh's 2005 Super League campaign. The 25-year-old, who has agreed a 12-month deal, returned to Australia following the Centurions' relegation and played for the Brisbane club Wynnum Manly before joining Whitehaven. Castleford's football manager, Michael Robinson, said: \"Mark is a tough, strong-running back rower. He is a non-quota player who proved his durability at Leigh.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
