Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team were in second place as they trained for Sunday\u2019s game against fourth-placed Manchester City and a big reason for their lofty position is their supreme fitness. The Argentinian has been working on ensuring his players are in prime shape since he walked through the door in 2014 and the players now feel they are stronger and fitter than any other team. The full-back Ben Davies joined Spurs from Swansea City the same summer as Pochettino and believes their fitness gives them an edge over their rivals, especially in the latter stages of games. \u201cWhen you first start putting all the work in, it\u2019s tough, you have to be determined enough to be able to put up with it every day to get yourself fit and maybe at times it gets hard but now maybe we see the rewards out on the field,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re covering more distance than teams, we\u2019re able to press teams and not give them a moment on the ball. That\u2019s not just for 20-30 minutes, that\u2019s throughout the whole game. The amount of goals and way we play towards the end of games really does show with the fitness, and as players you\u2019re able to keep going for longer.\u201d Davies says that Pochettino is keen for the players to work with, rather than without, the ball during the season but that it is still the toughest regime he has come across, and something he was not quite prepared for when he left the Liberty Stadium. \u201cThe intensity [was] something totally new to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI go back with Wales and tell them the amount of training we\u2019re doing and some of the players can\u2019t believe it. But we\u2019re not complaining when we\u2019re second in the league and we\u2019re playing better than a lot of teams in this league. It makes us feel proud of it.\u201d The Wales international also believes Tottenham\u2019s good form means the players keep pushing each other to even better performances. In short, there is no time to be tired. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big squad here and, if you are tired, you\u2019ve got fresh players ready to come in,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, in other words, don\u2019t be tired.\u201d It is easy to say, perhaps, when things are going well but Spurs potentially have another 22 games this season, if they reach the Europa League final, after the 35 already contested. Davies admits Pochettino is a hard man to please, but says that is part of what has made them play so well. \u201cEvery manager has got to have that strictness about them, but you know, he\u2019s got every player\u2019s respect here and everyone\u2019s bought into exactly what he wants. The easiest way for a player to buy into it is when results start coming, which they have for us, and if we keep going this way then we\u2019ll do well.\u201d Spurs are sure to keep going against Manchester City on Sunday and for the remaining 12 league games because it is what Pochettino has set them up to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
