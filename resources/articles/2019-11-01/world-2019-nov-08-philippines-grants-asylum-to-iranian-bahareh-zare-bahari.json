Bahareh Zare Bahari was the subject of an Interpol \u201cred notice\u201d issued by Iran, resulting in her detention on 17 October when she attempted to enter the Philippines. She cited fears that she would be jailed or executed in Iran on politically motivated charges. The Philippine justice department recognised Bahari as a refugee on 6 November, but released the document only on Friday. The justice department ordered her to report to the Bureau of Immigration so she could be issued a visa and registration certificate. \u201cIf the refugee has no passport or valid passport, visa stamping is not required,\u201d the document said. The document also recommends that a travel document be issued and work permit requirements be waived if Bahari wishes to work in the Philippines. On Saturday, Bahari was reportedly still in the airport, citing fears for her safety if she left. Bahari said she had studied dentistry in the Philippines since 2014, the year she left Iran. She entered the public eye at the 2018 Miss Intercontinental beauty contest in Manila when she displayed a poster of Reza Pahlavi, the Iranian former crown prince and critic of the current leadership. She has also spoken in favour of Iranian women\u2019s rights. The decision to grant her asylum comes after Bahari revealed the toll her detention had had on her mental health."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
