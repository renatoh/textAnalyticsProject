All stinks of desperation to me from an ailing channel.Also it is a shame that the Guardian have reported this article in this light. rj87h \u00b7 I think if Channel 4 had statistics that said the same thing about Celebrity Love Island or I'm a Celebrity, they would somehow also find their way into the public domain. It is all grist to the mill. There has been criticism from some important mental health agencies about Big Brother this year - it is a legitimate story for the Guardian to write about and adds to the debate. hound \u00b7 A survey of \"people who watch, or have watched Big Brother\". So that will be the two that watch it, and 550 that have stopped watching it. Hardly surprising 50% want it to be the last. Big Brother is having its best ratings ever - can't argue with that. Bluebaby \u00b7 The story said that 50% did not want it back and 36% did, with presumably another 14% who didn't care - and who probably aren't watching it anyway. johnnysmooth \u00b7 So 50% of people don't want Big Brother back. That leaves 50% of people who do. Channel 4 should be delighted! johnnysmooth \u00b7 Two problems with these so-called statistics. Firstly, as others have pointed out, these figures are coming from ITV, who will have used every distortion trick in the book to ensure that these were the results. Secondly, I would bet that if you had done this same survey two weeks in to any of the past series of Big Brother, the results would have been about the same, proving that what people mouth off about in a survey and what they actually genuinely think and act upon are two very different things. The rising viewing figures week-on-week speak for themselves. A third problem I personally have with this survey is the suggestion that the spin-off shows are too numerous: is anyone seriously suggesting getting rid of the excellent Big Brother's Big Mouth? The swines! bitoclass \u00b7 It won't end until it has had a year or two of clear decline - and even then, the damage it has done to the British media will still be there. jswalker \u00b7 ITV hasn't figured out that if you chase C4 formats, the best you'll get are C4 viewing figures. Nemesis \u00b7 We would not miss Big Brother but we would miss all the other Channel 4 shows it pays for. johnnysmooth \u00b7 BB may get them great press but doesn't pay for much Johnnysmooth - it is Deal or No Deal, Countdown, Paul O'Grady and all the other mainstream stuff that brings in the revenue, but with its \"edgy\" image, that's not really a story C4 wants to tell. rockdj \u00b7 I fear you're mistaken rockdJ. Big Brother alone accounts for about 2% of C4's year-round ratings and much, much more of E4. That's a lot of eyeballs and a lot of happy advertisers. And at a cost per hour, it is exceedingly cheap to make. O'Grady? Drop in the ocean compared with that. johnnysmooth \u00b7 Yeah - but how much longer are advertisers are going to want to be associated with such a friggin freak show? rockdj"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
