In his most upbeat domestic policy speech for many months, the president seized on the news to reframe the debate over what even the administration acknowledges has been a \u201ccrummy\u201d policy implementation, and what polling suggests is threatening to sink Democrat chances in November's mid-term elections. \u201cThis law is doing what it's supposed to do; it's working. All of which makes the lengths that critics have gone to scare people so hard to understand,\u201d he told a crowd of smiling administration officials in the White House rose garden. \u201cI have to admit: I don't get why people are working so hard to stop Americans getting health cover,\u201d added the president. Republicans are campaigning heavily to repeal the ACA, especially on the grounds that it threatens to close many less-comprehensive insurance policies, but Obama claimed the longer-term need to reach millions of uninsured people would ultimately prove more important. \u201cIn the end, history is not kind to those who would deny Americans their basic economic security,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the tall tales have been debunked: there are still no death panels, [and] armageddon did not arrive.\u201d Obamacare, he added, was about \u201cmaking sure that we are not the only advanced country that does not provide its people with basic healthcare\u201d. Whether the president can succeed in convincing floating voters \u2013 many of whom already have health cover \u2013 is another matter, though, and Republicans show no sign of backing down in their quest to make it the defining feature of the midterm elections. \u201cThe president\u2019s healthcare law continues to wreak havoc on American families, small businesses and our economy, and as I\u2019ve said many times, the problem was never just about the website \u2013 it\u2019s the whole law,\u201d said House speaker John Boehner in a statement. \u201cHouse Republicans will continue to work to repeal this law and protect families and small businesses from its harmful consequences.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
