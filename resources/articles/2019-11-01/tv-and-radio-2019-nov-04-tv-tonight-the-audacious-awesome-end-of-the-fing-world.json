Via an entire episode dedicated to another character (Naomi Ackie\u2019s blank yet somehow remarkably expressive Bonnie), we are filled in on a whole new strand of relevant backstory and yet, deliciously, hardly any the wiser about where the series might be going. It is a beautifully observed little tale that pulls off the admirable trick of being desperately bleak while remaining very funny indeed. Phil Harrison Dispatches: Puppet Masters \u2013 The Men Who Really Run Britain 8pm, Channel 4 The provocateurs behind the current political chaos get an expos\u00e9. With their taste for creative disruption, Boris Johnson\u2019s spad Dominic Cummings and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s comms director Seumas Milne are peas in a pod. What power do they wield? PH Meet the Bears 9pm, BBC Two Big old grizzlies, furry Paddingtons and icy polars are the big draws in this ursine spectacular. Among cute moments of bears having a nap after catching their salmon or fluffy cubs play-fighting, there is an undercurrent of how hard it is for them to survive, with six species vulnerable to extinction. Hannah Verdier Smuggled 9pm, Channel 4 Even in the light of recent, horrifying events, Channel 4 has seen fit to keep this postponed two-parter about Britain\u2019s border security in its schedules. Is there any way that a show in which British citizens attempt to enter the country without their passports can now seem anything but thoroughly tasteless? We will see. PH A British Guide to the End of the World 9pm, BBC Four A fascinating documentary about Britain\u2019s efforts to become a nuclear power. Ther is testimony from troops who witnessed tests on Christmas Island and recall wading through water covered with a \u201ccrust of dead birds\u201d, plus vivid stories from the home front, too. Terrifying, poignant and unmissable. PH Bouncers 10pm, Channel 5 It is a grim reflection on how strapped the UK\u2019s emergency services are that there is a need for the \u201cnew kind of private security firm\u201d shown in this series. In this hard-hitting opener, Marek and Greg help to tackle nocturnal lawlessness, from restraining mouthy punters to looking after semi-conscious drunks. Ali Catterall Film choice Stalag 17, 3.30pm, Film4 In Billy Wilder\u2019s witty, satirical demolition of the PoW drama, the Americans are far from the heroic types usually banged up behind the barbed wire. Instead there\u2019s Oscar-winning William Holden as the cynical wheeler-dealer, Sergeant Sefton, whose twin war ambitions are to survive and to make a quick buck.
