In a statement that followed a flood of progressive protest over the endorsement, which Rogan made on Thursday, the HRC\u2019s Alphonso David said Sanders had \u201crun a campaign unabashedly supportive of the rights of LGBTQ people\u201d. But, he said, Rogan had among other remarks \u201ccompared a black community to Planet of the Apes\u201d and \u201cdehumanised transgender people by misgendering them and promoting misinformation\u201d. The Joe Rogan Experience is one of the most downloaded podcasts on iTunes and Rogan has nearly 6 million followers on Twitter. His podcast attracts high-profile interviewees. In September 2018, for example, the tech billionaire Elon Musk smoked marijuana on the show, an act which sent Tesla stock prices tumbling. Rogan has also faced criticism over interviews with far-right figures such as Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes and the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Sanders, who was interviewed by Rogan last August, is a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination to face Donald Trump in November. Some observers said Rogan\u2019s announcement that he would \u201cprobably vote for Bernie\u201d was a win for the Vermont senator, showing he can win back white male voters who propelled Trump past Hillary Clinton in 2016. Rogan, who claims to \u201clean FAR more left than right\u201d, has said he voted in that election for the Libertarian Gary Johnson. Rogan spoke about Sanders and 2020 in an interview with the author and columnist Bari Weiss. Asked who he would \u201cvote for in the primary\u201d, he said: \u201cI think I\u2019ll probably vote for Bernie.\u201d He added: \u201cHe\u2019s been insanely consistent his entire life. He\u2019s basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing for his whole life. And that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from.\u201d Sanders, a lifelong democratic socialist and independent, tweeted video of the exchange. It prompted a progressive backlash. Rogan\u2019s views on transgender issues \u2013 regarding MMA athlete Fallon Fox, for example \u2013 have attracted widespread controversy. His reference to the Planet of the Apes emerged in the fallout over his remarks about Sanders. In a 2013 podcast, Rogan discussed seeing the film in question in an African American neighbourhood. \u201cWe get out, we\u2019re giggling, \u2018We\u2019re going to go see Planet of the Apes,\u2019 we walk into Planet of the Apes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe walked into Africa.\u201d Rogan also said \u201cPlanet of the Apes didn\u2019t take place in Africa, that was a racist thing for me to say\u201d and said his trip to see the film had been \u201ca positive experience\u201d. But the HRC was not giving him or Sanders a pass. \u201cWe should always be willing to educate individuals who operate from a place of bias,\u201d David said, \u201cbut we should not directly or indirectly validate or celebrate them. \u201cGiven Rogan\u2019s comments, it is disappointing that the Sanders campaign has accepted and promoted the endorsement. The Sanders campaign must reconsider this endorsement and the decision to publicise the views of someone who has consistently attacked and dehumanised marginalised people.\u201d In an earlier statement, a Sanders aide said: \u201cThe goal of our campaign is to build a multiracial, multi-generational movement large enough to defeat Donald Trump and the powerful special interests whose greed and corruption is the root cause of the outrageous inequality in America. \u201cSharing a big tent requires including those who do not share every one of our beliefs, while always making clear that we will never compromise our values. \u201cThe truth is that by standing together in solidarity, we share the values of love and respect that will move us in the direction of a more humane, more equal world.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 August 2020 to remove a reference to Fallon Fox as a \u201cUFC athlete\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
