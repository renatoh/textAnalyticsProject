The reason was rumours that Intermediate Capital Group has caught the eye of a European predator. Despite its \u00a3800m market value and FTSE 250 status, ICG is one of the best kept secrets in the Square Mile. The company specialises in high-yield debt and equity for private equity deals. It has provided finance for some of the biggest venture capital deals of recent years, including the \u00a31.75bn buyout of the AA from Centrica, off 1.25p at 247p, and the sale of over-fifties insurance and travel group Saga to Charterhouse Capital for \u00a31.3bn. For that reason, is it is bound to appeal to a number of companies. Traders would not be surprised if the company was on the radar screen of a European investment bank seeking to bulk-up or enter the booming UK buyout market. Amid talk that the mystery predator had been in the market buying stock, ICG shares closed 20p higher at \u00a312.19. In the wider market, leading shares powered to a four-year high. Mining stocks spearheaded the advance as investors piled back into the sector as the price of copper touched a record high. The final scores showed the FTSE 100 up 47.5 points to 5494.8, with Xstrata, 57p stronger at \u00a314.90, Anglo American, 62p higher at \u00a317.04, and Rio Tinto, 82p better at \u00a323.46, among the top performers. However, the day's biggest blue chip riser was Standard Chartered, the emerging markets bank, which gained 50p to \u00a312.40 as rumours of a bid from Barclays, up 6p at 576p, resurfaced. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 climbed 42.7 points to 7935.6, while the FTSE Small Cap index added 8.2 points to close at 3149.1. In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year gilt, closed around \u00a3103.860, yielding 4.262%. Catering company Compass went against the strong market trend falling 26.75p to 206p after revealing that full year profits would be below expectations. Drug company AstraZeneca was also in the doldrums. Its shares, which have risen 19% in the past three months, slid 29p to \u00a326.39 as investors decided to take profits on news that Teva Pharmaceuticals had applied to launch a generic version of AZ's best selling schizophrenia treatment, Seroquel. Charter was the top FTSE 250 performer, rising 52p to 393p after the engineering company raised its full-year earnings forecast, citing strong demand for its steel welding and cutting equipment. Elsewhere in the engineering sector, Cookson improved 8p to 327.5p on rumours that it has received an offer for its ceramics business. Spirent, the telecoms equipment testing specialist, improved 1.75p to 53p after investment bank UBS suggested it was a more likely takeover target than Marconi, up 12.25p to 317.25p. UBS analyst Robert Lea believes Spirent is a fundamentally sound company with a strong positions in growth markets. Elsewhere, low cost airline easyJet advanced 7.75p to 296.25p. Traders said FL Group, the parent company of Icelandair, had been in the market adding to its 13% holding. On the downside, Northgate, the van hire company which recently revealed a takeover approach, fell 55p to \u00a311.34 after issuing what amounted to a mild profits warning. Northgate blamed slower than expected fleet growth and falling hire rates. Burren Energy, the oil exploration company focused on Turkmenistan and Congo-Brazzaville, eased 6.5p to 839.5p. Traders said the company's brokers, KBC Peel Hunt and Seymour Pierce, had placed \u00a3100m of stock on behalf of two founding shareholders at 825p. The placing was two times oversubscribed. Minerva, fell 5.5p to 258p after the family of chairman Andrew Rosenfield sold 13.75m shares, about 8.5% of the property company, at 257p. Among the small caps, Stream Group shed 4.75p to 48.75p in heavy volume after the mobile phone content provider warned that full-year figures would miss market forecasts because of delays in launching a mobile banking product. DAT Group, the mobile software specialist, shed 3.5p to 72p amid talk that the company has been sounding out institutions and investors to see if they would be prepared to back a \u00a35m fund raising pitched at 65p. SCi Entertainment, the computer games developer that acquired Eidos this year, advanced 14p to 536p ahead of this morning's figures for the nine months to June 30. Analysts believe annual cost savings of \u00a314m from the recent acquisition of Eidos should be easily achievable. On top of that, traders reckon SCi, which is now one of the biggest gaming software companies in the world, could be a takeover target, though they were sceptical of rumours that US rival Electronics Arts wants to buy a large stake. Finally, keep an eye on Global Brands, which lists on Aim this morning. The company owns the Domino's Pizza franchise in Switzerland and Luxembourg, and City traders expect a strong debut. Its shares will start trading at 185p following a \u00a33.5m fundraising by stockbroker Hichens, Harrison, unchanged at 108.5p, that market professionals believe was heavily oversubscribed. Media matters Sometimes its pays to take the contrarian view. That was ABN Amro approach yesterday as it ushered clients into media stocks. The Dutch bank notes the pan-European media sector has underperformed the wider market over the past 18 months and is now the cheapest it has been since since 1999. However, it believes a rally could be on the cards and has identified several catalysts that could spark a re-rating - cheap valuations, bid speculation, shareholder activism, and industry consolidation. Its favoured stocks in Britain are news and financial informational group Reuters, up 10.5p to 379.25p, ad agency WPP, 10p higher at 586p, publishing house Reed Elsevier, 1.5p stronger at 524p and broadcaster ITV, which rose 0.25p to 112.25p yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
