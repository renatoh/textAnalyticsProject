Or rather, if you're Robbie Williams, one minute you're drinking 20 cans of Red Bull and 36 double espressos a day, the next you're fresh out of rehab, watching your old enemies Take That sit at the top of the charts with their exuberant ELO pastiche Shine, while your own single, She's Madonna, limps in at number 16. For most of the past decade, Robbie Williams has revelled in his status as British pop's top dog. He's won 15 Brit awards, sold 15m albums in this country alone and played three nights at the 100,000-capacity Knebworth purely to go one better than Oasis. Meanwhile, Gary Barlow was reduced to appearing on Heartbeat after his solo career tanked, while Mark Owen saw his flop not once, but twice - the second time after he won Celebrity Big Brother. While all this was happening, Robbie Williams never missed an opportunity to put the boot in - as Barlow grimly points out in his autobiography, My Take. As recently as two years ago, Williams was handed a Brit award for best British song of the last 25 years for Angels by Matt Lucas and David Walliams, who were dressed up as Gary Barlow and Howard Donald. Williams couldn't resist pointing out, \"I was always the talented man of the band.\" Now that boot is on the other foot. Williams' album Rudebox, an attempt to branch out into dance and electro styles that horrified his mainstream fan base, has sold half the amount of his previous LP Intensive Care (454,000 in Britain). Take That's Beautiful World, however, sold 1.15m after just six weeks - enough to make it the third best-selling album of last year. It's now the biggest record of their career. What must make it even more annoying for Williams is that Take That refuse to revel in his fall from grace. The nicest men in pop, if they do feel a certain schadenfreude, they're keeping it to themselves. \"I just want him to get happy again,\" said Mark Owen, while Howard Donald added, \"I'm upset some people think it's our success that's made him depressed.\" Meanwhile, the word is that, despite describing Rudebox as the album he had always longed to make, Williams is now planning another swing album. Although it's apparently to be titled Let's Swing Again, it might be more apt to call it Swing While You're Losing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
