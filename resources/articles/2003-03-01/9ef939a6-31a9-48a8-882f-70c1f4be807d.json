As we all know, a win or a draw puts Arsenal through - while a defeat leaves them clasping their hands in prayer to the Virgin Mary and hoping that Roma beat Ajax. No further news on the war on Iraq, you'll be pleased to hear. But what price our ever-enterprising bookies offering bets on the number of days it will last? Under or over 2.5 days anyone? 1 min We're off! Already your emails are flooding my inbox like the River Lea in rainy season. \"Transform your rod into a monster,\" says Tad Metcalf. Erm, that's not really what we want, Tad. 2 min Already Clive Tyldesley is dipping into his big book of bumper clich\u00e9s. He's just described John Carew as \"the Giant Norwegian\". What price him saying \"He's got a good touch for a big man\" before the evening is out? 3 min: Like the Super Furry Animals' third album Guerrilla, Arsenal have made a decent start - Ljungberg wins a free-kick, which Henry overhits. Let's hope they don't rapidly disappear up their own arses like aforementioned album. 5 min: Interesting news from the Stadio Olimpico: Ajax have gone 1-0 up against Roma in the first minute. If the score stays the same there, Arsenal need to draw (or better) in the Mestella. 7 min: Arsenal are continuing to run the game. Pires has hit the side netting with a speculator, and they're having most of the possession. \"Over or under 2.5 days: are you talking about the immediate war, or the repercussions?\" asks Jack Lee. Just the war, Jack. The repercussions will go on for decades, even centuries, won't they? 9 min: More promising work from Arsenal. Henry, fed by Pires, tries a dabbler from 20 yards which Canizares easily saves. \"Any sign of Heaven 17 there to do a rendition of 'We don't need this fascist groove thing?'\" asks Rob Hisnay. What do you think, Rob? No Heaven 17 here: just my colleague Barry Glendenning and a TV screen. Still, that's heaven to some of us... 12 min: At last Valencia mount an attack. Aimar jig-jaggers his way past two in the middle, exchanges a one-two but - with a shooting chance on - elects to pass. This could develop into a classic. To your emails. \"While no one can argue that his pupils have learned volumes about the beautiful game from him, I would argue that Wenger should take some presentation cues from his dashing players,\" says Neil in Ottawa. \"How can he persist with that hair-helmet? The man can speak umpteen languages fluently, but cannot find a decent hair stylist in London? Please explain to this confused Canuck.\" My advice for Arsene would be to opt for a Toni and Guy senior stylist, Neil. Just \u00a332 for a cut/style/blow dry - and worth every pound, surely? 14 min: Pires is sitting very deep - and a lot of the time Arsenal are playing a very patient 4-5-1. Still, so far it's working. \"What's wrong with the Super Furry Animals? I've always been quite partial to their existential Welsh psychedelic musings,\" says Mike Livesley. Me too, Mike. It's just that Guerrilla has about three good songs on it. 17 min: Time taken for Clive Tyldsley to proclaim that John Carew has a good touch for a big man (or words to that effect): 16 minutes, 11 seconds. 20 min: It's very even at the moment: Arsenal made a fast start, but have resorted to an away-side-in-Europe mentality: breaking slowly and cautiously. Let's hope, like two years ago, they don't concede a late goal. Incidentally, Edward Mackereth - a big fan of our cricket World Cup coverage - wants to know whether he can bring a cake into our offices tomorrow. Of course, Edward. If our capacious security guard doesn't wolf it down in one bite, we'll be most grateful to receive it. 23 min: It's quiet but tense at the moment. Valencia look the more dangerous, though - they're getting the bodies forward when they attack. \"Is your SFA analogy a reference to the extremely annoying and very loud 'mystery track' several minutes after the 'end' of Guerrilla?\" asks Craig. \"Are you suggesting that all the players will stand still and the crowd go silent for 15 minutes just before the end (perhaps in sombre recognition of the war) before some cheeky young 'un scores an undeserved goal for Valencia? If you are then pop a tape in for me, as it should be more entertaining than last Valencia - Arsenal game.\" Perhaps, Craig, perhaps. 25 min: So close for Arsenal! Ljungberg flicks it onto Henry, whose shot is tipped round the post by Canizares. But wait one second: the referee's assistant has his flag up - offside. Immediately Valencia break, but Taylor takes a good catch. 27 min: Excellent news for Arsenal fans: Cassano has made it 1-1 in Rome. It's less good for me, however, I've got a hefty wager - at 50-1 - on Ajax to win the Champions League. Ah well. \"Talking of hairstyles, WHO on the GU team had the frosted highlights - we're not going to let this one drop, you know\" says Jack Lee. Couldn't possibly say, Jack, but whoever it is carries it off spectacularly... 30 min: Unbelievable! Arsenal have nearly scored twice in the last minute. First Canizares slid out to block Wiltord from an oh-so-tight angle. Then, from the resulting corner, Gilberto's header - from five yards out, for chrissakes - hit Vicente on the line and rocketed up onto the crossbar. 32 min: Aimar has just ballooned a free-kick high over the bar (think Jaap Stam's shambolic penalty v Italy during Euro 2000). \"Keep up the good work - following the game with the Guardian is better than 24 hours a day IRAQ talk over here,\" says Rudy from Boston. Thanks for that message to us, Rudy. 34 min: GOAL!!!!!!! Valencia 1 - 0 Arsenal Spotting that the hapless Cygan - surprise, surprise - has got caught completely out of position, Aimar slips it through to the lumbering Carew, who slides it underneath the advancing Taylor. That's harsh on Arsenal... \"Like the last Gulf War when Massive Attack were made rename to Massive, will this be the same in the dying minutes with the Arsenal team launching a massive for a last minute goal to put them through?\" asks David O'Connell. You never know, David. 37 min: Yellow card Carboni, for a shocking take-your-ankles-off challenge from behind on Wiltord. Bad news for Newcastle: Inter are 1-0 up against Leverkusen. 40 min: These are worrying times for Arsene Wenger: Valencia are on top here, and Arsenal can't string a pass together. \"I too thought Guerrilla was rubbish apart from a few songs, and so never bothered with Rings Around The World,\" says Phil Mannion. \"Can the assembled hordes tell me if I missed out? (bearing in mind my thoughts on Guerrilla). Thought the first two were ace, though.\" 42 min A harsh yellow card for Vieira, who clatters Rufete (but also gets a lot of the ball). If Arsenal get through - admittedly, a big if at the moment - then Vieira will miss the first leg of the quarter finals. \"You may well have a point about Guerrilla, but at least it's better than Mwng, that all-Welsh offering which sounded like bizarre chamber music from a different world,\" says Mike Livesley. \"A bad bad world.\" I quite liked Mwng, Mike, but maybe I'm just weird. 44 min: More Valencia pressure: they've had a succession of corners in the last five minutes, and 80% of the possession. \"Is there any way to get the page to refresh automatically?\" asks Fouad Batlouni from Austin. \"What I've had to do is manually refresh it.\" The heart bleeds, Fourad - but there's nothing I can do. You're going to have to scroll the mouse up to the refresh button yourself. Half-time: After coasting for 35 minutes, Arsenal are now in deep, deep trouble. The way things stand at the moment, they're going out. \"The hapless Cygan?\" says a bemused Dr Paul Smith. \"And you said Tyldesley was rolling out the clich\u00e9s.\" OK, guilty as charged, Paul. 46 min: We're off again. \"My brother Simon thinks Cygan is fantastic: in fact he's made him his player of the month,\" says Steven Wells, preparing the inevitable punchline. \"He's a Spurs supporter. Ha bloody ha!\" 48 min: A positive start from Arsenal. Ayala hauls down Vieira in a promising position, but Henry's effort at goal - from a next-to-impossible angle, flies just wide of crossbar and post. \"If he finds it easier, Fourad can always hit F5 to refresh the page - a handy hint I picked up from reading the over by over cricket commentaries,\" says Chris Gottlieb. \"Also I don't think they ever had cakes on Test Match Special sent in by anyone called Edward. Edith maybe. On the other hand 'a rather lovely chocolate cake sent in by Mrs. Mackereth' sounds like just the job.\" Couldn't agree more, Chris. 49 min: YES! COME ON! ARSENAL HAVE EQUALISED! Valencia 1 - 1 Arsenal. Pires plays in Henry who, with Ayala closing rapidly like Jaws in full dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun pelt, curls a sweet short around the advancing Canizares. 52 min: Valencia try to rally, but Vicente's shot is about 30 yards wide. \"Please inform Phil Mannion that Rings Around The World also starts well with the jangly power pop of 'Sidewalk Surfer Girl',\" says the helpful Jamie Woods. \"On the whole, however, it was twenty Canadian dollars poorly spent.\" 54 min: Aimar, showing glimpses of Maradona, glides inside Gilberto only for Campell to make a brilliant sliding tackle on the edge of the box. Arsenal clear, then Pellegrino is booked for a comical dive on halfway. 57 min: Goal! Valencia 2 - 1 Arsenal Just seconds after Taylor has tipped a Carew header around the post for a corner, the Gunners go to sleep. Wiltord doesn't get a block into Rufete's cross, Carew gets the header in and Taylor - who appears to dive too early - can't keep it out. Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear. 60 min: More bad news for English teams: it's Newcastle 0 - 1 Barcelona. \"Sean, are you an Arsenal fan?\" asks Paul Martin. No, Luton, Paul (I know, I know - but you can't choose where you come from). It's just that I'd like to see Arsenal get through... 63 min: More Valencia pressure - again Arsenal are struggling to keep hold of the ball. \"For Fourad's benefit, tell him to get the Opera browser, and select \"Reload Every...\" - you can reload as often as you want, automatically,\" says Neil Denton from Canada. \"AND you're annoying Microsoft at the same time. Great :-)\". If only we got such intelligent emails from our American readers, eh? 66 min: From a Valencia corner, Ayala gets more hang-time than Michael Jordan in his prime. His header is firm and true - but, with Carew sniffing like an eager Yorkshire Terrier, Taylor makes an excellent save. \"I am watching the match on Venezuelan TV,\" says Rob Campbell from Caracas. \"My, these people are baseball fans. Which teams are going through to the quarter-finals if the scores stay the same?\" Valencia and Ajax, Rob. 68 min: Valencia sub: Sanchez off, Angulo on. \"If Ayala is Jaws, does that make Pires Quint (Robert Shaw)?\" asks Paul Kernell. \"And who is Roy Schneider?\" Thinking is beyond me at the moment, Paul. 69 min: So close for Arsenal! Canizares fails to hold a grasscutter from Wiltord and it spills out. Ljungberg pounces, only for the Spanish No1 to make the follow up save. He cops a boot for his troubles though, and - with his left eye bleeding - is still down getting treatment. \"Radiator is the best album, one of my all time faves,\" says Lawrence Hurley from Baltimore. Most people agree with you, Lawrence. Still, I prefer Fuzzy Logic. 71 min: After a two or three minute delay, Canizares is stretched off. Palop - no sniggering at the back - replaces him. 73 min: Ljungberg has just been cynically body-checked by Pellegrino, leaving Arsenal with a great free-kick opportunity, 25 yards out. Henry steps up... 74 min: ... and knocks it just wide, with Palop beaten. \"I know it's a spelling mistake but the chap's name inquiring about the refresh incapability of the guardian website is called Fouad that's \"heart\" in Arabic,\" says Ren. \"So there you go!\" 76 min: Arsenal sub: Jeffers for Wiltord. With 15 minutes left can he turn things around? 78 min: So, so close! From a Valencia corner, Arsenal fast-break. Henry speeds - Roadrunner-style - past one, two, three players and slips it into Jeffers, who is millimetres offside. \"I'll tell you what Fuzzy Logic is - comparisons of Carew and a Yorkshire Terrier,\" says Scott. \"It is the best SFA album though.\" Agree on both counts, Scott. 81 min: It's still Roma 1 - 1 Ajax. If the score stays the same in the Stadio Olimpico, Arsenal need to find an equaliser or they're out. Their efforts aren't helped by the Valencia players comically rolling about after every foul, though - shades of Anfield earlier in the season, anyone? \"It's got to be Fuzzy Logic,\" agrees Mike Livesley. \"Not every band has Howard Marks rambling incoherently on answering machine on their debut record (Long gone), plus Something 4 the Weekend and countless others made my summer so many years ago. Isn't it odd there's so many SFA fans who also don't subscribe to obscure digital channels? I think I just found my thesis subject.\" 84 min: Still no sign of the last-ditch Arsenal push yet - they can't find a way through the five-man Valencia midfield. Gilberto's just stepped over the ball, a moment which sums up his night. \"Since, as David O'Connell pointed out in the first half, Massive Attack had to de-warify their name during the last Gulf war, shouldn't Arsenal also shorten their name to sound a little less militaristic this time round?\" says David Omerod, who may or may not be related to Southampton striker Brett. \"Dropping three letters should do it.\" 86 min: If anything, Valencia look the more likely scorers at the moment. Aimar's just prowled into space and fired just wide. \"It might be a faulty memory, but didn't you guys have an automatic browser refresh on the live commentaries during the World Cup?\" says Andrew Ti. Certainly did, Andrew,. \"You need to get the web design team to work on something other than bob the builder animation ads.\" Agree - will put it to them when they're not planning trips to sci-fi conventions.... 87 min: Arsenal are drinking in last-chance saloon territory now. Kanu has just come on for Toure. \"Has Jeffers started diving for a penalty yet?\" asks Frazer in Dallas. Yes, but after he had collided with Ljungberg, which rather ruined the effect. 89 min: Valencia sub: Marchena on, Carew off. Valencia are now essaying a 5-5-0 formation. \"Could I, through your good offices and speaking as an academic, beg Mike not to write his thesis on SFA fans and digital channels?\" asks Dr Paul Smith. You can try, Paul. 90 min: We have five minutes of stoppage time. \"Will Kanu miss a sitter in the last few minutes?\" asks Taillur. \"Wager anyone?\" Every chance, Taillur. 90 min+2: Arsenal have gone route one: Lauren pumps a long ball forward, Jeffers feeds Pires who, under pressure from Reveillere, falls in the box. Penalty? No - yellow card for Pires. \"Viewing the DVD version of Rings Around the World explains everything,\" says Matt from Brooklyn. Everything, Matt? \"Just get as cooked as Gruff and co did when making it, watch the videos, enjoy self immensely. Simple, really. Oh and hang on Valencia!\" 90 min+4: A Valencia corner - not what Arsenal want at all. Still, it's cleared. The Gunners have one more throw of the dice... FULL-TIME No, that's it. Game over. And, to cap a bad night for English teams, Newcastle also crash out after losing 2-0 to Barcelona. \"I hate to disappoint Paul and cheapen his status as an 'academic' but the first 200 words are written and I look to be onto a sure thing,\" says Mike Livesley about his SFA thesis. \"I'll sprinkle it with long words, a few well timed Marx and Engel references and I should still have time to catch last orders tonight. Studying is hard.\" Indeed it is. Thanks for all your emails and goodnight, Sean.
