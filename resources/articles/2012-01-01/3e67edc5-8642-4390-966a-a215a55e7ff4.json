It is harder still for slightly built creative types prone to introspection. Imagine driving hundreds of miles to England training knowing the coaches doubt your defence, that you have no chance of starting and that your club will struggle without you. Then imagine being steamrollered by a rampant All Black team and brutally informed your Test career is over. Charlie Hodgson can talk you ruefully through it all, and more. At his lowest ebb he found himself wondering whether it was all worth it. \"I don't know if it was a case of not caring about playing for England but there were times when I found it difficult. I was third choice for a long time. You'd go into camp for two days, you're there as cannon fodder and then you go home again. You'd be constantly going away for nothing, really. That was the hardest thing: knowing that if everyone's fit your chances of playing were very slim. Someone would say: 'Keep doing what you're doing.' Ultimately, what does that mean?\" He has not even mentioned the two serious knee reconstructions, both suffered while representing England, which ruled him out of successive World Cups in 2003 and 2007, let alone the strain of trying to prosper in the Jonny Wilkinson era and keep his old club Sale competitive for a decade. \"I had some amazing times at Sale but being at the bottom of the table in a relegation battle is not good for you. When it happens for several years, it doesn't get any easier.\" What a joy, then, to find the 31-year-old Yorkshireman not just happy again but the bonnie prince of all he surveys. This weekend his new club Saracens, already second in the Premiership, hope to clinch a vital home draw in the Heineken Cup last eight when they play in Trevisoon Sunday. In a fortnight's time, with Toby Flood injured and Wilkinson out of the picture, he is set to be England's fly-half against Scotland, his first Test start in three and a half years. The birth of his third child, a son named Jack, has been another source of recent delight; his three-year-old, Henry, already spin-passes off both hands. \"I don't know whether to believe in fate but I suppose things happen for a reason,\" muses Hodgson. \"I've never stopped trying and I've always wanted to succeed.\" Even he, though, cannot quite believe he has dispelled the darkness of 2008, when the sight of him being brushed aside by Ma'a Nonu in a 37-20 defeat in Auckland prompted the tour manager Rob Andrew \u2013 \"Bits of Test rugby are not optional\" \u2013 to suggest his England career had run its course. It is longer still since he scored a record 44 points on his debut in a 134-0 win over Romania in 2001. Where has the time flown? \"I wonder that myself. How the hell have I gone from being the youngest in the England squad to being one of the oldest? The game's changed, everything's changed, I've changed.\" Connoisseurs of midfield distribution will beg to differ. There was a great example against Harlequins at Twickenham just after Christmas. Hodgson tiptoed flat and left, causing two defenders to lick their lips. Before they could react a bullet of a miss-pass had found a metre of previously non-existent space out wide. It was the work of an expert craftsman, happier to unpick locks than dynamite them. \"Coming up through school I was always told I wasn't big enough. For me it's always been about finding other ways of attacking. It was never about sending someone into a brick wall. I take more pleasure from putting someone through a hole and them scoring than scoring a try myself.\" Playing behind a dominant pack of forwards clearly helps, but subtler psychological factors may also be involved. For the first time in years the Premiership's all-time record point-scorer does not have the added pressure of kicking the goals, the precocious Owen Farrell having assumed that responsibility. \"I don't feel any less pressure going into games but maybe I am more relaxed,\" Hodgson concedes. The move south has also rebooted him mentally and comparisons with Wilkinson are finally redundant. \"He was such a perfectionist, with an OCD attitude almost. Maybe it proves that if you want to be the very best, go with his approach. If you want to be all right, go with mine.\" The line between self-deprecation and insecurity can be desperately slim. From the earliest days of his international career, sitting on the bench watching England's pack grapple with South Africa and Australia, self-doubt has always been an enemy. \"I remember thinking: 'If I get on this field I'm going to absolutely shit myself.' There are times when I think about the negatives too much. My wife always says: 'Think of the good times you've had in an England shirt. Think of all the good times you've had in a club shirt. They far outweigh what didn't go well.' It's true. When I do retire, I'm sure I will be proud of my achievements.\" His personal highlight was the 32-16 win over South Africa at Twickenham in 2004 but from England's perspective it is the future which counts. If, as expected, Hodgson lines up alongside Farrell and Brad Barritt at Murrayfield he will unapologetically borrow from the Saracens' playbook. \"When we play we want to play from the right areas. That's something I learned way back from Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 at Sale. Let the opposition waste their energy in their own half.\" Sarries do this more consistently than anyone. \"It isn't about guesswork, it's all about the stats. We study everything in minute detail to discover what works. What particularly surprised me were our passing stats. If we pass the ball way more than we do on average in the games we win, there's a higher percentage chance we'll lose.\" Hodgson has responded accordingly. \"I've probably changed what I do between our own 22 and halfway. From the halfway line onwards I haven't changed a thing. My attacking instinct is exactly the same.\" Similarly intact is a desire to change people's perceptions. Despite Sale's Premiership triumph in 2006 and his fine efforts for the midweek Lions in New Zealand in 2005, the Nonu experience still stings. \"I still maintain to this day it was a mistake from me but it didn't cost us the game. It was one of the hardest times because it was such a big stage but, at the same time, disappointment feels the same whatever level it's at. Defence has always been something I've had to look at and that never stops. \"I think I do have some unfinished business with England. There's a lot to prove to myself and other people. Probably over the last few years I've taken slightly more stick. This is an opportunity to silence a few people and do it for my own peace of mind. I feel there is a perception (about me). My goal was always to achieve and do the best I could. Sometimes that's been good enough, sometimes it hasn't. If I do get another opportunity I'll be very proud.\" No one deserves a happy ending more than England's pass-master."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
