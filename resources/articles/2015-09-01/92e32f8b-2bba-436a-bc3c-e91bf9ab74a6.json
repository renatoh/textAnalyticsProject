The rally in opposition of the Iran nuclear agreement in Washington on Wednesday represented the apotheosis of the populist conservative movement born in 2009. Nearly every movement celebrity over its half-decade history was in attendance on a sweltering late summer day. Conservative radio host Glenn Beck was behind the stage, pacing as he practiced his speech; former Alaska governor Sarah Palin was answering every question thrown at her by a small gaggle in the shade of a tree while Duck Dynasty\u2019s Phil Robertson stood impassively nearby; and 2012 presidential candidate Michele Bachmann mingled with other VIPs. Yet they were sideshows and historical relics compared to the political phenomenon that is Donald Trump. The billionaire real estate mogul is not a natural ally of the Tea Party, a movement whose ideological roots began as a populist uprising to big government in both parties. Trump has long been open about making campaign donations for political advantage, touted tax hikes and even expressed his comfort in the past with a government-run healthcare system, all of which are anathema to a group inspired by opposition to government bailouts for distressed homeowners in 2009. On Wednesday, Trump appeared surrounded by swarm of reporters wherever he went. One congressman, Tea Party icon David Brat, who won a historic upset over the then House majority leader Eric Cantor in 2014 primary election, had to wait for 10 minutes to approach Trump. Brat then posed for a picture with the GOP frontrunner and hinted at a potential endorsement. \u201cI\u2019m not picking a horse yet,\u201d Brat told reporters as he draped himself around Trump, \u201cbut I think he has a lot of good ideas.\u201d As Trump stood surrounded, taking an occasional question and paying particular attention to the locations of the various camera crews of television correspondents, Senator Ted Cruz stood alone, eyeballing his iPhone. It was a marked contrast from a major Iowa political event just two years ago where Cruz eclipsed Trump and marked himself as a presidential contender to watch. Then, at the Family Leader Summit, national reporters swamped Cruz in an availability following an electrifying speech by the freshman Texas senator. Trump, the last speaker of the day, spoke to a half-empty room. Their role reversal was made clear on Wednesday when Trump seemed to be on stage even before Cruz finished his remarks. They embraced and shared pleasantries. Trump even told Cruz\u2019s wife: \u201cYou look very nice today.\u201d It almost felt like a rabbi congratulating the bar mitzvah boy after his Torah reading and then going up to give his sermon. Trump didn\u2019t dominate Wednesday\u2019s event entirely. Palin gave remarks condemning the Iran deal, including the memorable utterance that \u201conly in an Orwellian Obama world full of sprinkly fairy dust floating from atop a unicorn as he\u2019s peeking through a pretty pink kaleidoscope would he ever see victory or safety for America or Israel in this treaty\u201d. An array of Republican congressmen rotated on stage to condemn the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton in bite-sized two-minute segments. There was even a birthday wish shared on stage by the event\u2019s emcee, Tea Party activist Jenny Beth Martin, to Matt Boyle, a reporter for the rightwing website Breitbart.com. But Trump\u2019s presence loomed throughout and many in the crowd at an event nominally devoted to the Iran deal had pro-Trump signs or wore Trump shirts or hats. The Tea Party is still a factor in American politics but it was clear on Wednesday that Trump\u2019s brand of anti-politics is gaining influence on the right. The House speaker, John Boehner, was just as unpopular as Barack Obama at the rally, as frustration with politics as usual has morphed into frustration with all politicians. As Duck Dynasty\u2019s Phil Robertson boasted at the rally: \u201cI was anti when anti wasn\u2019t even cool.\u201d And now that it is cool, Trump has become a new favorite."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
