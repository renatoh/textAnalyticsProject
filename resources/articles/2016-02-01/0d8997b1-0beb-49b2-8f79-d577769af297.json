The tech company announced better than expected results on Monday and gave investors their first proper look under the hood at the engine that drives its business. Operating income from its core businesses rose 23% in 2015. Investors liked what they saw and shares spiked 8% in after-hours trading. Alphabet closed the trading day valued at $518bn, behind Apple\u2019s $538bn. But if it holds on to that gain once trading begins again Tuesday, it would be worth close to $560bn \u2013 the company first broke the half-trillion marker in October. Wall Street has fretted for years about how much the core Google business was being used to fund founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin\u2019s ambitions to grow new businesses in robots, self-driving cars and spaceships. For the first time the company\u2019s core business was broken out from its big-swing \u201cmoonshot\u201d projects, allowing investors to see inside the tech giant with a little more clarity, and they like it a lot. Google segment revenues for 2015 were $74.5bn and it made a profit of $23.4bn. For 2014 Google segment revenues were $65.67bn and profits were just over $19bn. In contrast the \u201cother bets\u201d had revenues of $448m for the 12 months ending 31 December 2015 and lost $3.5bn. In 2014 the moonshots brought in $327m and lost $1.9bn. Google\u2019s ad revenue \u2013 its primary source of income \u2013 for the last quarter was $19.08bn, up 17% year-over-year, in the company\u2019s first earnings report as Alphabet. Market analyst Scott Kessler of S&amp;P Capital IQ said: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see that expenses are being more carefully overseen.\u201d But Kessler still has the stock as a \u201chold.\u201d \u201cThe company is in the crosshairs of regulators around the world,\u201d Kessler said, pointing to ongoing copyright litigation with Oracle and the company\u2019s investigation by the European Commission over antitrust concerns and rows over tax breaks. Kessler said the earnings might have resulted in \u201centhusiasm, even euphoria,\u201d but there were miles to go for Alphabet yet. \u201cThere are a lot of legal and regulatory issues that may come to a head this year,\u201d he said. It is the first time that Alphabet has provided specific numbers for its core business (Google\u2019s search engine, YouTube, Android, Google Play and other units that form the heart of its business) and for the rest of the companies businesses (Google X, its research arm, Calico, its biotech company, Google Fiber, high speed internet, Nest, smart home devices and other bets on future technologies). Ruth Porat, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said Alphabet was keeping a close eye on spending. \u201cWe remain on a journey, and it is still early days,\u201d she told analysts on a conference call. Outside of Google, Alphabet\u2019s subsidiaries will each have their own chief executive, reporting to Page. The structure is reportedly modelled after billionaire investor Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, which owns a complex portfolio of businesses including clothes manufacturer Fruit of the Loom, insurer Geico and this week bought Precision Castparts, maker of aerospace and other industrial parts. \u201cOur very strong revenue growth in Q4 reflects the vibrancy of our business, driven by mobile search as well as YouTube and programmatic advertising, all areas in which we\u2019ve been investing for many years. We\u2019re excited about the opportunities we have across Google and Other Bets to use technology to improve the lives of billions of people,\u201d Porat said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
