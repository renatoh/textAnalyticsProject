British elections expected in May lent an added charge to the largest protest, in London, where Tony Blair's staunch backing of the war has dented his support. Police said about 45,000 demonstrators participated in a march from Hyde Park past the US Embassy and on to Trafalgar Square. Organisers said almost 100,000 took part. Several army veterans were among the demonstrators. \"I disagreed with [the war] to start with because I was suspicious of the weapons of mass destruction claims,\" said Ray Hewitt, 34, a veteran of the 1991 Gulf War. \"I saw the Iraqi army in 1991 and we destroyed it.\" In Istanbul, Turkey, an estimated 15,000 people marched in the Kadikoy neighbourhood to protest against the US presence in Iraq. \"Murderer Bush, get out,\" read one sign. Two marchers dressed like US soldiers pretended to rough up another, who was dressed as a detainee with a sack on his head, a mimed criticism of prisoner abuse cases. In the southern Turkish city of Adana, home to a Turkish military base used by American forces, protesters laid a black wreath in front of the US Consulate to protest against the war, the Anatolia news agency reported. In Poland - which commands a multinational security force in Iraq that includes 1,700 Polish troops - about 500 protesters marched to the US Embassy in Warsaw, holding banners reading \"Pull out from Iraq now\" and \"Poles back to Poland.\" \"We are protesting this war in Iraq because it has no point. Only innocent people are killed, and nothing good results from it,\" said Klaudia Kosicinska, a 17-year-old high school student. At an anti-war march in the industrial city of Katowice, protesters - including one dressed up as a blindfolded Statue of Liberty - urged the United States and Britain to leave Iraq. In Athens, about 3,000 trade unionists, members of peace groups and students, brought the city centre to a standstill for about three hours as they marched to the US Embassy. In Sweden, about 300 protesters filled up Sergel Square in downtown Stockholm, chanting: \"USA, out of Iraq!\" The protests were nowhere near as big as those in February 2003, just before the war when millions marched in cities around the world to urge George Bush and his allies not to attack Iraq. \"People have become apathetic about this, it's no longer something they walk around thinking about every day,\" said Linn Majuri, 15, a protester in Stockholm. With international forces still facing violent opposition in Iraq, protesters were divided about what to demand from leaders now. While some wanted a full troop withdrawal, others argued that would leave Iraqis in a worse position than before the invasion. \"We got the Iraqis into this mess, we need to help them out of it,\" said London protester Kit MacLean, 29. Security was heavy outside the US Embassy in London, where cement barricades and metal fences blocked the building, as they have since the September 11 terrorist attacks. Two former British soldiers placed a cardboard coffin bearing the words \"100,000 dead\" outside the embassy. With music and banners, marchers in Rome called for the withdrawal of Italian troops from Iraq. \"Iraq to the Iraqis!\" read one banner. In Oslo, Norway, about 400 people rallied to demand that the 10 Norwegian officers in Baghdad be sent home. Norway has previously withdrawn 150 soldiers from Iraq. \"It's becoming more and more embarrassing that we are in the 'coalition of the willing' when many other countries are withdrawing,\" said Ingrid Fiskaa, head of the peace activism group Fredsinitiativet, which organised the event. Demonstrations were also planned in nine Spanish cities, including Madrid, Barcelona and the Basque seaside resort of San Sebastian. Many at the London protest vented their anger at Blair, who has been Bush's staunchest ally in Iraq despite strong domestic opposition to the war, especially among members of the Labour Party. Some at the protest said they couldn't support Blair, but didn't know who else to vote for. The Conservatives strongly backed the war while the Liberal Democrats opposed it. Several smaller parties are running anti-war candidates in hopes of loosening Blair's hold on power. \"I think it's outrageous what Blair and Bush think they can get away with,\" said John Salway, 59. \"I'd like to think we can put a dent in their arrogance.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
