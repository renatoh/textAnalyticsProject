Two injuries that\u2019s not good.\u201d Jordon Ibe, who replaced Coutinho after 18 minutes, scored the winner as half-time neared yet by the close Liverpool\u2019s manager was counting the cost of the victory, as Klopp\u2019s team ended the game with Lucas Leiva and Kolo Tour\u00e9 in central defence. The Ivorian also appeared to suffer a hamstring problem, though Klopp stated Tour\u00e9 had informed him this was only cramp. Liverpool travel to Exeter for Friday night\u2019s FA Cup third round tie and Klopp is unsure who he can field in central defence. While Tour\u00e9 may yet be available Mamadou Sakho, who has a knee injury, will not. Joe Gomez is another defender who is unavailable, due to a torn anterior cruciate ligament, and Klopp stated this may force him to add to his squad. \u201cIn this moment with no centre-backs fit I would say in this situation maybe we should think about that,\u201d the German said. \u201cTwo weeks ago we had three centre-backs \u2013 that\u2019s a good situation. When Liverpool started the season they had five with Joe Gomez and now nil in this moment. We could say: \u2018White flag, sorry, no [strong] team for Stoke next week, we play somebody else against Stoke and somebody else against Exeter.\u2019 That\u2019s not possible. So we tried everything, the boys did well, now we have the situation where we have to [go on].\u201d Six of Klopp\u2019s injured players have hamstring problems. In addition to Coutinho and Lovren, Daniel Sturridge, Martin Skrtel, Divock Origi, and Jordan Rossiter are all nursing maladies in the muscle. The manager appeared to bridle when asked if he would have to look at his training regime. \u201cWe don\u2019t train, we only recover so that\u2019s the situation now,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen should we train? There\u2019s no training. But no problem, really. I am responsible for these things, and if you want to make me responsible for our hamstrings \u2013 that\u2019s the next step, I know this. I know this.\u201d Of the performance Klopp added: \u201cThe only thing we can criticise is our finishing again. We had a good structure, played football good, everything was good but we don\u2019t make enough goals.\u201d Mark Hughes insisted the tie was far from over, with the second leg at Anfield to come on 26 January. \u201cAs it is it\u2019s just one goal and we\u2019re very much in this tie,\u201d the Stoke manager said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
