Wanchope is due to complete a \u00a3500,000 move to M\u00e1laga today, subject to a medical, and City want Mido on a season-long loan, for which they will pay a fee of around \u00a3250,000. City's manager Kevin Keegan has also revived his interest in Ronaldo Waterreus, the PSV Eindhoven goalkeeper, after Sander Westerveld turned down a move from Real Sociedad. Westerveld is keen to return to the Premiership but the former Liverpool goalkeeper does not want to be understudy to David James. \"Sander will be leaving Real Sociedad but it won't be to Manchester City,\" said the Dutchman's agent Ton van Dalen. \"He's looking to compete for a first-team place but not against England's No1. \"I have told Kevin Keegan that Sander wants to join a club where he stands a chance of playing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
