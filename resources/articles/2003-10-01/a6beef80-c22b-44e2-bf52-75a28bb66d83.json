Adverts for the part-time post, which pays \u00a39,000 a year, appeared today in newspapers and on the PCC's website following a commitment by its new chairman, Sir Christopher Meyer, to strengthen the panel by appointing an extra lay member. Applicants must be able to demonstrate \"a record of achievement in their own walk of life, an interest in an appreciation of the dynamics of the free press, an acceptance of the principles of self-regulation, and an ability to analyse and digest a large amount of written material\", and have until October 31 to apply. Sir Christopher announced the move last night in his speech to the Society of Editors. \"As you will recall the first plank was to strengthen the PCC's independence - one of its trump cards - by adding an extra lay commissioner. I added - the second proposal - that I wanted the appointment, along with all future lay appointments, to be advertised openly,\" he said. \"I intend to interview a short list of candidates in November; then a decision will be taken by the independent appointments commission in December.\" The culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, recently called on the PCC to reform to avoid being perceived as a Masonic lodge. Ms Jowell said an independent ombudsman was needed to hear appeals against PCC findings, and that the body should increase public confidence by advertising its appointments for lay members and striving for greater transparency. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
