The legislation, sponsored by Liberal Democrat QC Lord Lester of Herne Hill, would for the first time enable unmarried couples, including same-sex partners living in a mutually supportive relationship, to make legal provision for their joint protection. \"Under existing law, cohabiting couples have no automatic next-of-kin rights, property or pension rights,\" said Lord Lester today. \"The bill will provide the framework for a legally recognised relationship of civil partnership.\" The bill has Liberal Democrat backing but the other two main parties have refused to clarify their position, amid speculation that the Conservative party is to abandon its traditional hostility to such reform and back a limited reform of the law, although not as currently proposed by Lord Lester. \"We are working on the final policy line but we are not supporting the bill,\" a party spokesman said today. A government source added that \"the government is aware of the growing debate within society on civil partnership registration and the associated rights and responsibilities. This is a complex set of issues which we will now be looking into very closely\". \"We will be undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the potential financial and administrative implications of civil partnership registration.\" However it seems likely that the bill will not be given government parliamentary time, greatly limiting its chances of becoming law."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
