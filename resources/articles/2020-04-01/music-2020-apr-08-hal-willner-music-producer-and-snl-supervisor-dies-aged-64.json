No cause of death has been confirmed, but he was said to be experiencing symptoms consistent with the coronavirus. \u201cSome people are such a gift to the world,\u201d Judd Apatow tweeted in tribute. \u201cThey just put good stuff out there and make our lives better.\u201d Willner started work as sketch music producer at SNL in 1981. Seinfeld and Veep star Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who was an SNL cast member from 1982-85, paid tribute to Willner on Twitter: \u201cAbsolutely devastated to get this news about my weird and lovely pal, Hal. We are heartbroken.\u201d Paula Pell, an SNL writer from 1993-2003, tweeted: \u201cHal Willner was the gentlest genius at SNL. He bemoaned artists abandoning weirdness and authenticity but never gave up searching for it. We love you forever. Fuck off this disease and especially its enablers.\u201d As a producer, Willner worked on albums by Lou Reed (Ecstasy, The Raven, Lulu), which led to the pair becoming \u201ckind of best friends\u201d, Willner told the New York Times in 2017. \u201c[Reed] did not accept that he was going to die. Bowie did. Leonard [Cohen] did. Lou just ranted. He just loved being alive.\u201d Willner also produced the album Strange Weather for Marianne Faithfull \u2013 who was recently hospitalised with symptoms of the coronavirus. His work on the record led Americana star Lucinda Williams to ask Willner to produce her 2007 album, West. He was also known for his idiosyncratic covers albums. In 1980, he produced Amarcord Nino Rota, an album of jazz covers of music from Fellini films, featuring artists including Debbie Harry and Chris Stein of Blondie, trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and guitarist Bill Frisell. Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor, Sun Ra and His Arkestra, and the Replacements played on 1988\u2019s Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films. Leonard Cohen, Chuck D, Diamanda Gal\u00e1s, Keith Richard and Charlie Watts were among the stars who performed on 1992\u2019s Weird Nightmare: Meditations on Mingus, which featured instruments designed and built by the American composer Harry Partch. Joan Jett, who performed on an as-yet-unreleased T-Rex tribute album curated by Willner, tweeted that he was a great producer: \u201cThe music industry has lost an incredible member of our community.\u201d He was said to have played a key role in the career of Jeff Buckley, inviting him to a 1991 tribute concert for Buckley\u2019s father, Tim, which introduced him to the New York music scene that would launch his career. In 2017, he told the New York Times he was worried the culture that had defined his life was becoming less important. \u201cI don\u2019t know what inspires people now,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t need to be inspired in that way. Do these last two generations have heroes? I\u2019m not sure they do. I go to Avenue A now and listen to what people are talking about, and it isn\u2019t culture. \u201cWhen John Lennon died, I couldn\u2019t go to work for two days. I wonder if they have someone that they look at like that \u2013 an author, a poet, whatever. Those are people who made us what we are.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
