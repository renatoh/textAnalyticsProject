And because Easter falls unusually early this year, prices are much lower than end-of-season deals in previous years. Frances Sweetman, of the Ski Club of Great Britain (020 8410 2000; www.skiclub.co.uk), said: 'The season has been extended because Easter is so early - people tend to think that the season finishes then, but this year there are still a good number of weeks after the Easter holidays. And there's plenty of snow to see us through April.' Companies are already offering good deals on the extended season, and Sweetman predicted that even better late-season bargains may be released over the next fortnight, through websites such as www.ifyouski.com and www.iglu.com. Inghams (020 8780 8813; www.inghams.co.uk) has extended its season in Austria, France and Switzerland, with extra departures on 9 April. Prices start at \u00a3468pp for seven nights' half-board accommodation at the three-star Hotel Pepi Gabl in St Anton, including flights from Stansted and transfers. Crystal Ski (0870 160 6040, www.crystalski.co.uk) is now offering departures to 19 French resorts between 10 and 17 April, with prices from \u00a3419pp for seven nights' catered chalet accommodation in M\u00e9ribel. Thomson Ski (0870 606 1470; www.thomson-ski.co.uk) is offering 15 resorts in France from 9 April, with seven nights starting at \u00a3419pp in a chalet in Tigne. A spokesman said: 'We started the season early, and will go right through to 5 May. It's the first time we've done it - we've been lucky with the snow, and it's quite cheap.' Other April deals are available from Ski Val (0870 746 3030; www.skival.com), which has seven nights' half-board in Val d'Is\u00e8re from \u00a3529pp including flights, and Ski Famille (0845 644 3764; www.skifamille.co.uk), which is offering seven nights' chalet accommodation in Les Gets and five days' childcare from \u00a3420pp, excluding flights. There is still availability on Easter skiing with Directski.com (0800 587 0945), which has three nights' half-board in Lillehammer, departing 24 March, from \u00a3359pp, and Ski Val, whose catered Chalet Arabella in Val d'Is\u00e8re is available for seven nights from 26 March, from \u00a3999pp."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
