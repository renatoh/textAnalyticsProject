Sir Michael Caine review \u2013 relaxed, charming, and faintly bemused all by the fuss", "bodyText": "Arnie\u2019s done one. So has Sly. But Michael Caine\u2019s live in-person show was an altogether classier and more celebratory event: hosted by Jonathan Ross in front of a packed crowd of Caineophiles at the Albert Hall, featuring loads of celebs and the London Symphony Orchestra playing soundtracks from Caine\u2019s greatest hits. It was like a special Michael Caine populist prom, combined with This is Your Life with Ross wielding his clipboard like Michael Aspel\u2019s big red book. Caine himself was a joy, uncorking anecdotes new and old and all of them vintage. He recalled triumphs like The Man Who Would Be King and disasters like his hokey killer-bee thriller The Swarm, but treated those impostors just the same. (Of The Swarm, he remarked, forgivingly: \u201cI still eat honey.\u201d) He was entirely relaxed, charming, faintly bemused by the fuss and sometimes cheerfully vague about names. Yet however beautifully distinguished the LSO was \u2013 conducted at certain stages by none other than Quincy Jones, composer of music for The Italian Job \u2013 I could perhaps have done with a bit less music and a few more straightforward clips of Caine himself to go with the chat, actually acting and doing the legendary dialogue. And I also felt it a shame there wasn\u2019t more about his classic turn in Educating Rita. But you can\u2019t cover everything \u2013 and what an evening. Perhaps inevitably, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon introduced the proceedings from high up in the gallery, doing a Statler-and-Waldorf-type quarrel about who does the best Caine impression. (Has the comedy community forgotten about Paul Whitehouse\u2019s surreal impression of Caine as a nosy neighbour?) The man himself told us that despite his cockney icon status, he began his screen career as a posho metrosexual whose image was continually under scrutiny. He was turned down for the cockney corporal in Zulu but, on an impulse, the American director Cy Endfield asked Caine if he could play an upper class officer. The repertory-trained Caine answered stoutly in the affirmative and history was made. Caine made a point of reminding the Albert Hall crowd that Endfield was an American and a class-bound Brit director in those days wouldn\u2019t have let him play against type. But then he revealed that the US moguls were unhappy about his British accent and general style. In The Ipcress File, they noted his downbeat spy Harry Palmer \u201cwears glasses \u2026 shops at supermarkets \u2026 cooks for women \u2026 this guy\u2019s too gay.\u201d We were in pure A-list reminiscence heaven as Caine recalled making The Italian Job (\u201cI had the most incredible evening with Noel Coward at the Savoy Grill\u201d) and working with Laurence Olivier on Sleuth: the great man had written a formal letter to Caine saying that it was quite in order to address him as \u201cLarry\u201d. During the shoot, Olivier\u2019s performance only took off once he put on a false moustache. \u201cI can\u2019t act with my own face,\u201d he told Caine crisply, to which the younger man replied: \u201cI can\u2019t act without mine.\u201d His deadpan delivery took the Albert Hall roof off. It was like eavesdropping on an uproarious late lunch at Langan\u2019s in the mid-80s. When Caine arrived in Hollywood, he brought his mum and she marvelled at all that \u201chysteria growing up the wall\u201d. On another occasion, he recalled calling at the LA home of fellow expat Brit David Hockney, who had also brought along his mother. Caine turned on a full Yorkshire accent for Mrs Hockney looking around and saying, wonderingly: \u201cAll this lovely sunshine, and no one\u2019s got any washing out!\u201d This gag more or less broke every window pane in the building. Caine modestly said he was doing more gardening these days, but actually he\u2019s working as hard as ever, acting for Italian auteur Paolo Sorrentino on his new movie Youth. He saved most praise for Christopher Nolan, for whom he played Alfred the butler in the Batman movies, and also acted in Inception and the forthcoming Interstellar, and whom he called the \u201cnew David Lean\u201d. His praise encouraged a would-be director to come out of the audience and interrupt the show for some minutes while he gave Caine a script and stammeringly explained it \u2013 Caine seemed amused and intrigued. He emerged, as ever, as a class act."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
