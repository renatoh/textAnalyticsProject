John Vidal\u2019s interactive project Mekong: a river rising won the digital media award on Thursday night, seeing off 11 other entries from media organisations including the BBC, Al Jazeera and Channel 4. Published late last year to coincide with the UN climate change summit in Paris, the six-chapter production took readers on a journey down the vast river system in south-east Asia that sustains 70 million people. On his journey, Vidal met people struggling to deal with the impacts of climate change as well as the ecological havoc created by giant dams, deforestation, coastal erosion and fast-growing cities. Meanwhile, world affairs editor Julian Borger won the press award for his piece titled Syria\u2019s truth smugglers, published in May 2015. The story highlighted the risks taken by a team of Syrian investigators to collect secret government documents that provide evidence of war crimes by Bashar al-Assad and his regime and asked whether an international court would ever hear their cases: As investigators, Adel and his team perform what has to be one of the world\u2019s most dangerous jobs, repeatedly diving into the murderous chaos of Syria to follow a paper trail of war crimes. While attempting to smuggle a batch of documents across the northern Syrian border, one of Adel\u2019s colleagues was ambushed and killed. Another was shot four times when his car came under fire from a government position. Several have been detained and tortured. Adel has come close to death several times. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith was nominated in the same category for a piece headlined Vuvuzelas, Pistorius and Mugabe\u2019s warped rule: my six years in Africa that he wrote at the end of his stint as Africa correspondent. The Guardian\u2019s Global development team took the top prize in the short film category for its film on El Salvador\u2019s harsh abortion laws. The film was unanimously voted the winner by the judges, who described it as \u201ca confident film with a cinematic flavour, which manages to cover so much in such a short time. We\u2019re drawn in by its powerful emotional stories and left with a growing sense of outrage\u201d. Sune Engel Rasmussen, a Kabul-based contributor to the Guardian, picked up the new voice award for his \u201chardy and determined\u201d reporting from Afghanistan. One World Media is a non-profit organisation that has supported international journalism and promoted media coverage of global issues for almost 30 years. Other winners included BBC2\u2019s Outbreak: The Truth About Ebola in the television documentary category and Alex Crawford\u2019s team from Sky News for From Syria to Safety in the news category. Sky had two other nominations for the news award. A full list of winners can be seen on the One World Media website. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 June 2016 to include a fourth award win for the Guardian.
