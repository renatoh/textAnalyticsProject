The cancellation is indicative of the ICC's increasingly incoherent approach to the crisis. Speed's conduct had hitherto been typical of his approach to his five-year tenure, adopting a bullish, high-profile stance and sticking tightly to the letter of the ICC regulations. Sonn meanwhile has taken a low-key role and it was significant that Speed did not name the president among ICC officials who were party to Darrell Hair's $500,000 offer to resign. Sonn's restraint contrasts with his previous form as chairman of the South African Cricket Board, when he was notorious for eccentric outbursts. The fate of the two men may be intertwined, with sources suggesting that Speed may postpone plans to step down after the 2007 World Cup after lobbying from ICC members. Whether Speed will stay is another matter. Heads could roll to resolve the current shambles - the umpires' manager, Doug Cowie, may not be sleeping easily - and in any case Speed's main challenges have been met. He has overseen the agreement of a six-year international calendar and the venue for every major tournament until 2019, and a new, four-year television deal should be done by the end of the World Cup. No Khan do Shaharyar Khan, president of the Pakistan Cricket Board, should resign from the ICC and be charged for breaching the code of conduct according to Richard Bevan, head of the Professional Cricketers' Association and a leading figure in the international players' union, Fica. Bevan believes Khan's outspoken criticism of Darrell Hair would have brought a charge had it come from a player rather than a director of the ICC, and has inflamed an already volatile situation. Khan's conduct has also strengthened the argument for reform of the ICC and the introduction of independent directors as well as player representation on the main board. \"There is a lack of management skill and leadership on the ICC board, demonstrated by directors openly criticising their employees,\" Bevan said. \"We must have independent directors and a better calibre of executive leading the game.\" Andorra a draw England's opening Euro 2008 qualifier against Andorra on Saturday will not be played in front of a full house at Old Trafford, but the FA expect a turnout of about 60,000 for the first competitive match under Steve McClaren, below. While the new quadrant sections at the ground will be closed, 43,000 tickets have been sold, almost as many as for the friendly against Greece 10 days ago. Premier punters The Football Association's failure to bring a disrepute charge against the Portsmouth player Richard Hughes after the revelation that he gambled on Harry Redknapp becoming Pompey's manager last season demonstrates the difficulty the governing body faces in making charges of this nature stick. Players betting on a manager's appointment is not in itself a breach of FA rules, so the absence of firm evidence that Hughes had used inside information made a charge impossible. Further charges are not out of the question, however, as Hughes's is just one of several names passed to the FA compliance unit by Betfair, many of whom are more high-profile. Class is permanent The voting for BBC Sports Personality of the Year promises to reveal more about the electorate than the competing sports stars. Following Zara Phillips's eventing World Championship gold medal on Sunday the contest seems to be between the princess and two relative paupers, Andy Murray and Monty Panesar. Victory for the 11th in line to the throne, matching her mother's success in 1971, would indicate that the age of deference has not completely passed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
