The results show that while the outgoing Prime Minister's stock with the public has fallen dramatically, his would-be successor is well regarded, although he is not perceived to have much personality. While Blair has little time left in office to alter the public's view of him, today's findings may help the Chancellor decide how to present himself in both the looming battle for the Labour leadership - and the fight with David Cameron at the next general election in 2009 or 2010. On the two most important attributes which interviewees were asked about, the score between Blair and Brown is one-all. While 25 per cent of the sample felt the Prime Minister was 'a capable leader', just 17 per cent said the same about Brown. However, on the issue of who 'understands the problems facing Britain', 22 per cent felt the Chancellor did, 2 per cent more than for Blair. 'Being seen to understand the country's problems is potentially a big plus point for the Chancellor, as is \"understands world problems\" - especially as he's never been Foreign Secretary,' said Sir Robert Worcester, the life president of Ipsos MORI. In addition, 23 per cent believe Brown has 'sound judgment', 15 per cent think he is 'down to earth' and 13 per cent see him as being 'more honest than most politicians' - all higher rankings than those for Blair. The bad news for the Prime Minister from the poll, added Worcester, is that all the negative attributes it reveals are concerned with him. Fifty-one per cent think he is 'out of touch with ordinary people', 29 per cent believe he 'tends to talk down to people' and 28 per cent see him as 'too inflexible', while only about half those numbers think the same things about Brown. Blair's ratings have plummeted since April 2005, just before the last general election, when Ipsos MORI asked voters to identify the attributes which they believed best described fitted Blair and the then Tory leader, Michael Howard. Several findings, however, may give Brown cause for concern. A mere 8 per cent of people think he 'has got a lot of personality'. By contrast, Blair still scores 22 per cent in this regard, despite the growing disenchantment with him. Worcester cautions: 'The \"personality\" characteristic is one of the least salient image attributes we asked people about, which is good news for the Chancellor. 'However, the fact that he's not seen to have a lot of personality by a lot of people could simply reflect that he hasn't had the limelight that Blair has had, or it could be a problem for him. Come the leadership contest, he will have a chance to shine. 'Look at David Davis, though. In the Tory leadership last year, Davis was seen as a shoo-in to beat David Cameron, but lost. What was the difference between them? Image, personality - not substance.' In addition, a significant minority of voters - 24 per cent - see Brown as 'out of touch' and just 12 per cent rate him as 'patriotic'. The latter result may come as a disappointment to him, as he has invested time and effort to identify himself with 'Britishness', most recently in a speech in Edinburgh last Friday. \u00b7 Ipsos MORI interviewed 988 British adults aged 18 and over between 31 August and 6 September for its Political Monitor survey"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
