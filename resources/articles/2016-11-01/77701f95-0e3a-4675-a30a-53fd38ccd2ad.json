They say it\u2019s obvious it\u2019s down to Rafa\u2019s tutelage.\u201d Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s transformative impact in the north-east can hardly be overstated and his Championship topping side will arrive at promotion rivals Leeds United on Sunday seeking to an extend an eight-game winning run. Hayden attributes much of Newcastle\u2019s success to their manager\u2019s alliance of a forensic eye for detail, an assured grasp of broader strategy and excellent communication skills. \u201cThe England coaches want you to come up with ideas about how we\u2019re going to beat varying types of opponents,\u201d explains the 21-year-old Arsenal academy graduate, who spent last season on loan at Hull City. \u201cThey seemed really pleased with me this time, they said: \u2018You\u2019re coming up with different ideas from everyone else.\u2019 Again, that\u2019s down to working with Rafa. He loves his little details and they transfer to us players.\u201d The cult of the manager can sometimes be overplayed but it is no exaggeration to say that, at St James\u2019 Park, the Ben\u00edtez effect has been extraordinary. Indeed after simultaneously \u201ctaming\u201d Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s maverick owner, bonding the club with its previously disillusioned fans and revitalising a squad which had looked lost as it tumbled out of the Premier League last season, it would be no surprise were the Spaniard to be spotted walking on the Tyne. Although undoubtedly a consummate politician who, crucially, commands the respect from both boardroom and dressing room which Steve McClaren, his predecessor, lacked, the manager has surprised many people with his consistent warmth. \u201cYou might think a manager of his calibre might not be like that \u2013 some high-level managers and even some top players can be quite distant \u2013 but the gaffer\u2019s warm,\u201d says Hayden with the thoughtful intelligence which distinguishes his tactically articulate game. \u201cRafa\u2019s so easy to talk to, you can speak to him about anything and he\u2019s the same with everybody: players, support staff, fans. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, he\u2019s as friendly as anything and that\u2019s really helped the lads. \u201cHe\u2019s reconnected this club to the fans and the city and united it. There\u2019s no unrest anywhere. The manager, players, staff, owner and supporters are all pulling in the right direction and, at the minute, that\u2019s having a massive impact on our football. Everyone\u2019s united and it shows on the pitch.\u201d Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has imbued Arsenal with similar dignity and class but Hayden, who parted with the Frenchman on excellent terms and admires him immensely, feels the pair could not be more different. \u201cThey\u2019re polar opposites,\u201d he says. \u201cTwo totally different people. Ars\u00e8ne doesn\u2019t really say much, when he\u2019s at training he just watches and you might hear his voice three or four times a session. Max. He sees absolutely everything, though, every mistake you make. \u201cThe gaffer here is much more hands on. He talks us through sessions and helps us out. I prefer that style of management. It gets the best out of me; I know exactly how he\u2019s feeling about me and what he wants me to improve on.\u201d Hayden fully buys into Ben\u00edtez\u2019s love of squad rotation \u2013 something which proved controversial in his early days at Liverpool before winning the Champions League. \u201cThe big difference between being here and at Hull last season is that no one\u2019s certain to play any game under this manager. Everyone\u2019s on their toes, there\u2019s a lot of competition for places, everybody\u2019s fresh, working hard in training and doing the right things and, touch wood, we haven\u2019t had many injuries.\u201d Last season Hull started strongly, with the side under Steve Bruce looking near certainties for automatic promotion before suffering an alarming February wobble and going up via the play-offs. \u201cThe difference was that Steve essentially utilised the same players all the time and it got to February and March and then the lads who\u2019d played Saturday-Tuesday all season hit a brick wall,\u201d says Hayden. \u201cThey were knackered.\u201d Meanwhile the understudies were losing heart. \u201cIn October and November Steve played the same starting eleven nine games in a row. It got to the point where some players didn\u2019t even bother bringing their wash bags any more \u2013 you knew you weren\u2019t going to get a game.\u201d Even so he enjoyed working with Bruce, now Aston Villa manager, who helped him grow up. \u201cSteve\u2019s easy to talk to. You could knock on his door and chat to him,\u201d he says. \u201cBut he had a lot more of an old school mentality and was very demanding. \u201cHull\u2019s training was vigorous. It wasn\u2019t uncontrolled but it was very intense, less controlled than here or Arsenal. We had lots of double sessions, lots of gym work and running. It was my transition to the real adult professional game and it taught me the importance of a hard-working mentality.\u201d On top of that are the benefits of harmony. \u201cSteve was very good at setting us up to deal with different opponents but it didn\u2019t help that Hull\u2019s owners wanted to sell and the fans didn\u2019t like the owners and would show their disgruntlement,\u201d says Hayden. \u201cThat filtered through to the manager and on to the players. At times it wasn\u2019t the nicest feeling. In April, when we played Brentford at home and were still in with a chance of finishing second, only 15,000 turned up and they were waving placards and shouting \u2018Allams out\u2019.\u201d With the days of anti-Ashley and anti-Alan Pardew protests a receding memory, Newcastle is very different. \u201cWe get more than 50,000 every home game,\u201d says Hayden. \u201cIt helps that we\u2019ve got the biggest crowds in the Championship, the best atmosphere and the best fans. They\u2019re so loud some of our away games feel like home matches.\u201d Elland Road is a 38,000 sell-out on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s a hostile ground, not the nicest place to go,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a problem for us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
