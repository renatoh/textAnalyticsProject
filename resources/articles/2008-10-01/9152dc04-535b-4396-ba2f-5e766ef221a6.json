We tend not to linger long on what we regard as normality, he reasoned, so that it exists only as a faint outline, like a footmark in dewy grass or Gary Neville's goatee. As it was in ancient Greece, so it is in the world of sport. This week, for example, much newsprint has been devoted to the retrospective testing of urine samples by the IOC and the UCI, cycling's governing body. The testers, we are told, always lag behind the cheats and, frankly, given what the cheats are on that is hardly surprising. However that does not matter quite so much nowadays, because the IOC and UCI have taken to freezing and storing the samples. To the rest of society two international organisations that keep the frozen fluids of the famous in laboratories would be a plot strand in a series starring David Duchovny, but to those of us in sportsworld it is so ordinary that we have ceased to wonder at it. Yet the more you consider the thing, the weirder it gets. Think about it: all across the globe there are buildings filled with humming freezers stocked top to bottom with frosted, icy pots of athletes' piss. No doubt these are all arranged and noted according to some scientific method, though it is hard to avoid the conclusion that - since we all begin stocking our domestic freezers with the same good organisational intentions - they will eventually end up a hopeless jumble. Then places such as the lab at Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry will resound with irritable conversations along the lines of: \"Did we use Richard Virenque's 1999 urine? Because I can't find it in here anywhere.\" \"I'm not sure. But I froze the leftover portion of that chicken and mushroom pie the other day. Have you looked under that?\" \"Well, why would you put that in with the 1999 Tour de France samples? You know poultry-and-pastry has its own section.\" \"You say that. But I only had to put it there because the shelf for Jan Ullrich's 2002 wee had a half-finished tub of low-fat blueberry yoghurt ice cream on it. And the only person who likes that is you.\" I am saying the urine is stored in pots, though of course that is just a guess. Thus far the sort of containers they use to store the stuff in has not been mentioned. However, based on experience it is odds on that if you visit your local Lakeland store you will find a shelf marked \"Sporting Piss Solutions\". In all probability there will also be an attractive vinyl tool, for extracting the urine in one piece, that attaches to the freezer door with an ornamental magnet in the shape of a West Highland terrier. Of more concern long term is what is going to be done with all this urine once the authorities have finished with it. We have heard a lot in the past seven days about the frozen urine of Lance Armstrong and Bernhard Kohl but, let's face it, that is just the tip of a very large, yellow iceberg. In Beijing alone there are 5,000 samples. Disposing of such material is no easy matter, because athletes' urine is not something to be tampered with (unless you happen to be a coach of track and field stars, obviously). As we know from the past decade it is frequently powerful stuff, containing up to 1,000 times the normal testosterone levels, not to mention steroids, HGH, EPO, THG, Cera, ELO, ELP, KLF, and Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Titch too in all likelihood (all of which, I hasten to add, have been metabolised quite naturally by the athlete's own body - a pharmaceutical production facility on a par with anything Glaxo has ever built). Splashing this powerful, foaming brew about willy-nilly, as it were, is a short cut to disaster. If not properly managed it will inevitably work its way into the earth's delicate ecosystem. Soon plants will be absorbing it through their root systems, bees through pollen and squirrels through nuts. The effect this could have on flora and fauna that is ill-equipped to cope with such a sudden massive jolt of male hormones, amphetamines and the like is the stuff of nightmares. Thirty days after the final of the 2002 World Cup Fifa simply flushed all the samples it had taken over the preceding weeks down the drain. Shortly afterwards there were internet reports that a 240lb vole with bulbous breasts and a baritone squeak had attacked and eaten a sewage worker in Nagano and then driven off in a Jeep Cherokee with Guns N' Roses blasting from the stereo. The authorities covered it all up, of course, but once the IOC and UCI start to empty their freezers, as they must if they are going to get yet more frozen samples plus a selection of fun-sized turkey-based party snacks for the festive season into them, then such incidents are certain to increase. Chestnut trees with conkers the size of medicine balls, dahlias wolf-whistling at passing women and mackerel that nod in agreement to the outpourings of Jeremy Clarkson - unless we are very careful that is the future normality we will all ignore."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
