In Northern Ireland's loyalist paramilitary death cult - where brigadiers' burials are both art-form and pageantry, with hundreds of mourners and volleys of shots fired into the air by men dressed as army-surplus clones of the SAS - Gray's muted goodbye was a sign of how far he had fallen. The shamefully small send-off from a loyalist estate in east Belfast was as unbecoming as the hideous acts of violence he had sanctioned in life. Gray was once the most flamboyant loyalist godfather in the Ulster Defence Association, his permatan and bleached bouffant hair earning him the nickname \"Doris Day\", though never to his face. Had he died last year, he would have been afforded a farewell akin to a state funeral. But his life and death at the hands of his former loyalist comrades is a parable of 21st-century Northern Ireland. For a decade, \"Doris\" was both the head of the east Belfast UDA and one of Northern Ireland's flashiest drug dealers, a paranoid cocaine addict who only accepted banknotes from drug deals if they were handed to him with the Queen's head facing up. The \"Brigadier of Bling\" drove BMWs, ruled working-class estates with sophisticated extortion rackets and broke the nose of anyone who looked at him the wrong way in the pubs that he owned. He was a celebrity gangster in an organisation mired in racketeering, drug dealing, extortion and prostitution, and whose declared war against the IRA was often seen as an afterthought to its criminal empire. But he was also, it is now suggested by his one-time loyalist associates, a Special Branch informer, who touted on his friends. Expelled from the UDA in March for \"treason\", he was murdered last week while on bail facing money-laundering charges. He died the way of many UDA leaders before him, murdered by his own men in an organisation that has torn itself apart by feuds, most of them criminal turf wars rather than ideological splits. But it was a sign of his total isolation in his final days that among the six people who were questioned and released over the murder was a close friend. This week, instead of the hundreds of newspaper death notices that normally mark the murder of a loyalist leader - Gray himself once posted a sympathy notice for a man he had ordered to be killed - there were only a handful of messages from his family and former lovers. Instead, loyalists in east Belfast held a street disco to celebrate his murder and lit a bonfire to burn an effigy of him with a curtain ring to represent his gold earring. Even before he was buried, there were fears that his gravestone would soon be desecrated. Jim Gray came from an average family on an average loyalist estate in east Belfast. In the 1980s, he scrapped his dream of becoming a professional golfer and focused on working his way up the UDA, the biggest loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland. The UDA had grown up as a loose umbrella for neighbourhood vigilante groups in working-class Protestant areas in the 1970s, killing Catholics under the cover-name of the Ulster Freedom Fighters. Gray saw it as a way of getting rich and acquiring status, allowing him to collect a designer wardrobe which he would then parade around Belfast. His life was a bizarre cross between a mafia film and a Duran Duran video. In the tattoo-tight-T-shirt-and-moustache world of paramilitary styling, his penchant for pastel knitwear and Hawaiian shirts was a dangerous game. \"There was always something strange about Jim, wearing slacks and shoes with no socks, even in winter,\" the convicted UDA killer Michael Stone told the Belfast Telegraph. Gray's apparent bisexuality was always a source of rumours and jibes in the homophobic circles of the UDA. After his marriage broke up, his womanising intensified as he tried to rubbish the taunts. He was caught having sex with a young woman by two pensioners in the ladies toilets of an east Belfast working man's club last year. Even in the UDA's neurotically macho environment - where a former loyalist drag-artist saw his pet Chihuahua, called Bambi, shot by rivals - Gray was not afraid to stand out. He arrived for a UDA meeting with the then Northern Ireland secretary John Reid in 2002 in a floral shirt with a pink jumper draped around his shoulders, incurring the wrath of an incredulous Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair, also at the time a UDA brigadier, who is said to have commented: \"That's some image for our organisation.\" Adair, whose own dress sense tended towards football hooligan chic, was later blamed for having Gray shot in the face. Although Gray's rivals rued the failure of that assassination attempt in 2002, they took comfort that they had ruined his looks. Gray spent \u00a311,000 on plastic surgery to reconstruct his face. Gray ran his personal criminal empire from an unofficial HQ at his Avenue One bar opposite the red, white and blue murals of loyalism's \"freedom corner\" in east Belfast. He dealt drugs from Belfast and along Northern Ireland's monied \"gold coast\" towards Holywood and Bangor. He made money from extortion and prostitution and took monthly trips to Spain to oversee smuggling rackets. Protected by a trusty gang dubbed the \"Spice Boys\", he once said he was not a paramilitary but a \"businessman\", because plain old loyalism didn't pay. He lived in a \u00a3250,000 flat in a luxurious gated community near the police headquarters. For years, Gray epitomised the irony of the crime lord supposedly fighting for a better society. He met MPs to discuss prisoners' rights, one minute eating muffins in the House of Commons tea room and the next, according to his fellow loyalist delegates, chopping and snorting cocaine in a five-star London hotel. Before his life was cut short at 47, he had been thinking of investing his money in the legitimate construction industry which promised to drag Belfast out of the shadow of the 30-year Troubles in east Belfast's new \"Titanic Quarter\". Violent rages The same year that Gray met John Reid as part of a loyalist delegation, his 19-year-old son Jonathan died of a drugs overdose while on holiday with him in Thailand. Gray had taken \"JJ\" out of his top Belfast grammar school at 16 and introduced him to drugs and paramilitarism. His son died in a hotel room surrounded by prostitutes after taking a cocktail of steroids and heroin, after his father, in the same hotel, allegedly did not reply to mobile calls for help. It has been said that Gray, famed for his foreign holidays and cruises, travelled to Thailand regularly as a sex tourist procuring teenaged boys. He tried to cover up the way his son died, according to Jonathan's mother, who had left Grey when her son was four. She told journalists that she never forgave him. Gray was not a \"trigger-man\"; the worst put-down levelled at him by the foot-soldiers was that he had never fired a shot in anger during the \"war\". But he certainly gave orders to others to maim or kill on his behalf. In 1992, he is said to have ordered the then east Belfast brigadier Ned McCreery to be shot dead, allegedly for being a police informer. Gray conveniently took over McCreery's pub and his job as boss of east Belfast. Then in January 2001, Geordie Legg, the UDA man who had carried out the McCreery killing, met an ugly death after he allegedly stood in the way of Gray's drugs empire. Legg was tortured and beaten by Gray and others in one of Gray's Belfast pubs, the Bunch of Grapes. His body was rolled up in a carpet taken from the bar and dumped on the outskirts of the city. He had been repeatedly stabbed and his killers had tried to sever his head. The bar was subsequently set on fire to destroy the evidence of torture. Gray went to the funeral to offer his sympathies. His violent rages, too, were legendary. He was banned from one golf club in Belfast after he took a club to the head of a man who had beaten him. Once, when things weren't going his way, he is reported to have pulled down his pants and defecated on the 18th green. He also liked urinating in the glasses of people in his pub. Once, Gray and his gang of drunken loyalists gatecrashed a wedding reception at a hotel near Belfast. When the bride's father asked them to keep the noise down, Gray ordered the old man to be dragged outside and battered. During an outdoor Rod Stewart concert at Stormont, Gray was witnessed leaving the VIP enclosure to pummel a man in the crowd, repeatedly stamping on his head in front of the rest of the audience, before calmly returning to his seat. In recent years, when he was spending \u00a32,000 a week on cocaine, his paranoid rages worsened. He kept money in shoe-boxes and believed people were plotting to kill him. In 2003, he led a campaign of intimidation against the Sunday World, a Sunday tabloid which was exposing paramilitary drug dealing. The paper had faced down the loyalists for five weeks when one night one of the paper's senior journalists, Jim McDowell, opened his front door to a policeman who told him Gray was standing in his pub, the Avenue One bar, with \"more snow up his nose than the Swiss Alps in January\", advocating sending two men to McDowell's house to shoot him dead. McDowell and his family had to leave the country for two weeks while Gray cooled off. For more than a decade, all this was apparently compatible with Gray's high position in the UDA. But in March, after a meeting of the leadership, he was expelled. Jackie McDonald, the UDA leader who plays golf with the husband of Irish president Mary McAleese, and who wants to turn the organisation away from drugs and towards community work, said Gray was guilty of \"treason\" and \"building a criminal empire outside the UDA\". Gray - who once walked into a car showroom with a carrier-bag full of cash from drug deals and ordered three BMWs - was an obvious first target for the UDA's much-vaunted drive to clean up its organisation. Late last year, after years of bloody UDA feuds, the government had finally recognised the group's ceasefire amid scepticism in Northern Ireland, but with Downing Street hoping it might be the first step towards curbing crime and drawing the organisation back into the fringes of the political fold. The UDA now wanted to show its good intentions. But many had doubts. \"Getting expelled from the UDA for criminality is like getting expelled from the Ku-Klux-Klan for racism,\" said the SDLP's Alasdair McDonnell at the time. The government's anti-racketeering Assets Recovery Agency was moving in on Gray. Some said the UDA wanted to distance itself or was angry that his wealth had not been pumped back into the \"cause\". Eight days after he was ousted, Gray decided to flee to Spain. He never made it. He was arrested in his silver Mini Cooper in County Down, apparently heading for the Irish border, with a banker's draft for \u20ac10,000 and \u00a33,000 in cash. He was accused of money-laundering, possession of criminal property and concealment of criminal property. He tried to tell investigators that his wealth came from a lucky break in a Las Vegas casino and that he had the receipt. In jail on remand, Gray was said to be cracking up, desperate for cocaine and swinging between strutting off for visits in a pink shirt and sitting in tears in his cell saying no one liked him anymore. Then Gray made what loyalists say was his worst mistake. He applied for bail. Police cautioned against it, saying he was under a death threat. By now, even his former closest allies were convinced he was going to turn supergrass. Some loyalists wanted to kill him to shut him up; an array of others had vendettas against him. In September, Gray was granted bail, to the outrage of local politicians, some of whom wrote to the lord chief justice demanding an explanation. He was released on condition that he would live at his father's modest home on a quiet loyalist estate in east Belfast. He was not allowed to go out at night and was a sitting target. He still thought he was invincible, though, frequenting his favourite Chinese restaurant, answering his door in nothing but gold jewellery and white shorts. One weekend, he drove to the heart of his former stronghold to verbally abuse his replacement brigadier's wife before screeching away with three cars of UDA men in hot pursuit. He was, in the words of one loyalist, \"a dead man walking\". On October 4, at around 8pm, he was shot five times in the back at close range while he was carrying weight-lifting equipment from his car. As his body lay on his front lawn, crowds gathered to photograph the corpse. One spectator said down his mobile phone: \"There's nothing like good news. I bet you're dancing now.\" Last of the caricature brigadiers? Gray was murdered at a volatile time for loyalism. During July and August, the Ulster Volunteer Force had killed four men in a feud with the smaller splinter group, the Loyalist Volunteer Force, one of whom was shot dead while moving debris from the rubble of the demolished Avenue One bar, which Gray had sold. A teenager was killed in north Belfast in August in what is thought to have been a sectarian murder by loyalists. During riots last month, both the UVF and the UDA opened fire with automatic weapons on army and police in the worst street violence seen in Belfast for 10 years. If Gray's murder is found to have been sanctioned by the UDA leadership - who have the convenient alibi of all having been at a meeting at a south Belfast bar when he was shot - the Northern Ireland secretary Peter Hain will be under pressure to review the group's ceasefire. But whether Gray was the last of the caricature celebrity brigadiers remains to be seen. Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair, the former UDA leader who tops the loyalist death list, is in exile in Bolton. The 5ft 3in bodybuilder, known as the \"Wee Man\", was recently back in prison in Manchester accused of threatening violence against other exiled members of his gang. The night he was released last month, he beat up his wife, Gina Adair, and is awaiting sentencing. He would like to return to Belfast, the only place where he can be \"somebody\", but his one foray into Belfast in February, for a quick photograph in front of a paramilitary mural, was short and sharp. With Gray dead, the most colourful figure on the scene is Andre Shoukri, the UDA's north Belfast brigadier, known as \"the Egyptian\". The 27-year-old, with a Belfast mother and Coptic Christian Egyptian father, flaunts his smart suits, denies stories of his embarrassing gambling habit and is the UDA pin-up. He once allegedly charged women in pubs and clubs \u00a35 for his autograph on shirts, photographs and loyalist emblems in the run up to July 12. Meanwhile, there are no murals to the memory of Doris Day, only graffiti on a wall in east Belfast reading: \"Jim Gray RIP - Rest in Pink\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
