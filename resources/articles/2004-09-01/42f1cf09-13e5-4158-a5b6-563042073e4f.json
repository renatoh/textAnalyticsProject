But it admitted that it does not have the power to force universities to toe the line. Its recommendations include developing a universal \"aptitude test\" which would eventually be taken by all applicants, revamping the existing application form and urging universities to provide failed candidates with feedback about the reasons for their rejection. Universities are also being given the green light to choose students from ethnic minorities over other applicants in order to increase diversity at college. But the taskforce has ruled out blanket discrimination which, controversially, would have favoured state school applicants over their competitors from private schools. As expected, the final report from the Admissions to Higher Education Steering Group strongly backs a new admissions system known as PQA (Post Qualifications Application) based on students' actual, rather than predicted, results. Education secretary Charles Clarke has ordered the setting up of an implementation group, headed by the government's director general for higher education, Sir Alan Wilson, to look at the arrangements and possible timescale for the new system. Professor Steven Schwartz, vice-chancellor of Brunel University, led the taskforce and said students' predicted grades, which are used in the current applications process, were \"highly unreliable data\". \"Half of all predicted grades are wrong,\" said Prof Schwartz. \"There are a large number of people who could be admitted to our selective universities who are never there. We have come to the conclusion that we really do have to seriously move to a post-qualification admissions system because the current one is just not fair.\" Professor Schwartz said the Government should move towards implementing PQA \"as soon as possible - ideally within a few years\", adding that it only needed \"a bit of good will and perhaps a bit of a push\" to make it happen. But he admitted that universities would not be bound by the taskforce's recommendations because its remit was divorced from that of the proposed new Office for Fair Access (Offa). Offa will scrutinise universities' plans to charge top-up tuition fees of up to \u00a33,000 a year from 2006. They will only allow them to do so if they are satisfied that they have bursary packages in place to help the least well off and plans to recruit more students from a wider range of backgrounds. The head of Offa - likely to be someone from outside the higher education sector - will be appointed by the end of the month. The taskforce was split on the issue of a national aptitude test, and whether that could be modelled on the US version - the so-called SAT test. It is pressing for a universal test to be developed which could be part of the new range of qualifications for the 14 to 19 age group. Charles Clarke said change was long overdue: \"I am concerned that over many years a system of Post Qualifications Applications (PQA) has acquired the reputation of a holy grail for the higher education admissions world - desirable but not achievable. Although I am aware of the practical difficulties I remain persuaded by the arguments for such a system and think it is time to make it achievable. It must be fairer and more transparent for students to know their final results before making important choices about where and what to study and this must also aid decision-making by universities.\" But Phil Willis MP, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: \"It took the Government seven years to recognise what students, parents and universities have known for a long time: it is fairer and easier for students to apply to university after they have received the results on which the whole admissions system is based. A speedy implementation is now crucial. No university should be allowed to use traditional practices and thereby delay the urgent introduction of the new rules.\" Professor Ivor Crewe, president of the Universities UK umbrella group, said: \"We look forward to working with this group to ensure that a PQA system is developed which is practical both for potential students and universities - as well as for other education stakeholders.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
