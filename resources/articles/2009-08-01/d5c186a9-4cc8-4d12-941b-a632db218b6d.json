He tells us why comedy audiences are less stressful than pupils, then shares a little more than we really need to know about his randy dog.

He tells Miles why he's called his new show Daydreamer \u2013 especially when he's staying up late every night at the Stand. Canadian standup Pete Johansson, who's playing at the Underbelly, shares some images from his life and tells Miles why he thinks Edinburgh has everything a man needs.

The irrepressible Pappy's Fun Club are winning rave reviews for their record-breaking attempt to squeeze 200 sketches into an hour. They allow you to sample their wares, with a little number called Samuel Pepys Show. If you're in Edinburgh, we want to see you!
