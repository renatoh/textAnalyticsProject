He needs to know how to invest her money to pay the fees. He writes: 'One of my mother's best friends is 102 and my mother is determined to beat her. At the moment, she is 93 and I am worried her money will run out before she does. She has recently left her flat and will soon be going into a residential home. She is on the borderline of needing nursing care. The manager of the residential home says they can cope with her but that might not be permanent. She was active in the Church and the Women's Institute. She reads and writes poetry, but in the last three years her memory has gone a bit. I have power of attorney and wish to maximise her income to pay for her care home fees of \u00a3310 a week. She has a small pension from my late father plus her state pension and interest on \u00a3125,000 from the sale of her flat. This is in the Halifax earning 3.4 per cent gross but we are thinking of moving it to a better-paying account and getting the interest paid monthly to meet the fees. The trouble is, I reckon she will have a shortfall on the fees of \u00a3250 a month. Her personal spending will be minimal but she needs a little money for the occasional chocolate bar, getting her hair done and the chiropodist once a month. I want to make up the shortfall by getting a higher income from her savings. It has been suggested that this money could earn 5.44 per cent tax free in a corporate bond fund. It is important to her, as it was to my father, to protect the capital. She feels strongly that she and my father worked hard and saved and she is aggrieved she now has to pay for care. She wants to leave something to my brother and me. That's what people were like in those days. That is one of the reasons that she has been reluctant to go into a home. She wanted to stay in her own house but the carers couldn't cope with her. What would be the greater risk: to allow the capital to decline as it is used with the interest 'to top up' her fees, or to buy a bond? I have to say, though, that she wouldn't understand if her money did go down in value. She pays tax at 20 per cent. I queried this because I thought, at 93, she shouldn't have to pay so much, but she does. Do you need some financial coaching? We help readers to solve their financial challenges.

Try to assess how long it will be before your mother might need to go into a nursing home. 3. Decide if you want to take some risk, and spend capital, to raise the money you need. 4. For no risk, keep the money in the bank and spend the capital. 5. Or decide how much risk to take and choose corporate bond funds or a guaranteed income bond, still keeping some money in the bank. Action plan Investing someone else's money is a great responsibility and you have a problem. Your mother cannot earn the amount she needs from her savings without taking some risk and/or spending her capital, and the squeeze will only get worse. You can expect home fees to rise by about 5 per cent a year, certainly well above the retail price index measure of inflation. And later on she might need to move into a nursing home, which will cost a lot more. Your mother needs to earn 6.25 per cent net (7.81 per cent gross) to meet the fees and this is not possible from a safe investment. In consolation, if you decide to be less cautious than she would like, or to spend her capital, she will not know and therefore will not worry. Colin Jackson, of financial adviser Baronworth, suggests what he thinks is best in a bad situation: 'They could put \u00a3100,000 into a five-year guaranteed income bond, payable monthly. Countrywide Assured pays 3.43 per cent net which gives \u00a3286 a month. And then put the remaining \u00a325,000 in a building society, withdrawing the amount they need each month to make up the shortfall of about \u00a3364.' One downside is that after five years, the \u00a325,000 has been used up, although the \u00a3100,000 is safe. Another is that the \u00a3100,000 is locked away for five years and, as fees rise or your mother moves to a nursing home, she cannot get access to the money. So, before investing, you will have to judge how to split the money between bond and cash. Jackson does not recommend corporate-bond funds: 'This plan includes the known risk of losing \u00a325,000 over five years but, with corporate-bond funds, you could lose more that.' Rebecca Price, an adviser with BestInvest, believes corporate-bond funds might be the answer: 'I am convinced that the way ahead is to maintain a diversified approach and put some money in a higher-risk investment while keeping the rest on deposit. Isas and corporate bonds are a highly tax-efficient way of generating an income for her. Corporate bonds and cash both have a valid place.' Her money will not be locked away in these. At the safer end, she suggests high-quality corporate bonds such as Legal &amp; General Fixed Interest and New Star Sterling Bond: 'Both invest exclusively in high-quality corporate bonds and yield 3.5 per cent net, similar to bank interest rates but with the outside chance of capital gain.' Your mother can earn a fraction more from higher-risk corporate-bond funds, says Rebecca: 'Two funds which combine high quality and high yield are Threadneedle Strategic Bond, 3.6 per cent, and Norwich Managed High Income, just under 5 per cent.' By taking a much higher risk, she can earn 6 per cent: 'It does not meet her wish to be cautious but she could put a very small amount into Legal &amp; General High Income which is invested 100 per cent in high-yielding, and therefore high-risk, stock. You cannot get anything yielding higher than that.' If you decide against taking any risk, you will have to keep all her money in the bank. National Savings rates are too low for her, even when tax free. Bank and building society accounts paying interest monthly give a lower rate of interest and a deposit rate of 3.5 per cent gross is worth just 2.8 per cent net. You should put \u00a33,000 a year in a cash mini-Isa to keep it tax free. You will spend the money to make up the fees and, as her capital goes down, so does the interest earned. But Rebecca warns: 'Cash is useful for a smaller percentage of her money but it will be eroded by inflation.' \u00a3#183; Advice is for guidance only"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
