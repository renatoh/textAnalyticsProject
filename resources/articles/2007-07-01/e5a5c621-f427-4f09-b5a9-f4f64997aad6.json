It would be encouraging to report that he ironed out all the wrinkles and left a contented Colin. As it was, if the practice holes had been a foot in diameter, he would still have probably missed. The Scot had entered the Open theatre like a ray of sunshine, radiating bonhomie and goodwill to all men. Here was a Montgomerie so imbued with the sheer happiness of stepping out into the rain-sodden yonder that the corners of his mouth seemed permanently raised. Here was a sportsman at perfect ease with himself, his breast burning with the inner confidence of having ended 19 months of angst and uncertainty by winning the European Open in Ireland. Here was no Mr Grump or Mr Face-ache. Monty the munificent had replaced Colin the curmudgeon, with the cries of \"Come on, Monty\" prompting something close to a cheery wave rather than a basilisk stare. Of course, it could not last. Away winged his first three-wood, straight and true, and as he approached the initial green the birdie putt was a mere five feet or less. Monty settled, relaxed and sped the ball forward. \"I'll be giving it a go,\" he had said on the eve of his 63rd major. \"Very few putts will be short this week. I'll be thinking of every putt as a half, and a halve is never short.\" Unfortunately he omitted to mention accuracy. It slewed wide, to the softest of sighs from the gallery. He frowned and began to contemplate a life free of good-humoured friendliness to all creatures great and small, including photographers. The next putt, at the 2nd, lipped the hole and stayed above ground. Worse was to follow at the 3rd, with a shot dropped - the third left-to-right putt he missed in succession. Monty played some wonderful shots between tee and green. A birdie at the 6th, aided by a screaming drive down Hogan's Alley, drew him to level par, only to three-putt the 7th. Frustration was seeping in. At the 15th the Scot finally nailed a second birdie to go back to level par, only to immediately throw away the good work. \"Camera, camera\" he snapped on the penultimate hole as a press photographer caught his eye. At the last, another missed putt and another dropped shot. Monty the munificent was a chimera, Colin the curmudgeon the solid reality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
