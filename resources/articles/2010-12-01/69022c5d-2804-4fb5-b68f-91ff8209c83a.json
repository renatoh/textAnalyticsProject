The central proposition is interesting enough, as the band's youthful mastermind Jack Barnett pits brass and woodwind against the digital thunder of hip\u2011hop and dancehall, but that's just the beginning. Hidden is a wintry labyrinth of arresting details: the swords that slice through the centre of We Want War, the children's choir that chants the title of Attack Music, the little pockets of light and air in Hologram, the way that Drum Courts \u2013 Where Corals Lie snaps between mechanoid violence and pastoral gusts of Elgar. Right down to his inscrutably threatening lyrics (\"It was September, harmful logic\"), Barnett avoids the obvious at every turn and follows his own internal compass. Hidden is not just the most original record to emerge from Britain this year, but the most unfathomable: an immaculate enigma."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
