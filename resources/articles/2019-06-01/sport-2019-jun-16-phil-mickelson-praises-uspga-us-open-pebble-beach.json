Mickelson\u2019s jibes \u2013 verging on castigation at times \u2013 towards those who preside over the US Open appeared to come to a head in 2018 when he was penalised for deliberately striking a moving ball at Shinnecock Hills. He later conceded \u201canger and frustration\u201d \u2013 we all knew towards whom \u2013 got the better of him. There seemed, at that stage, no potential for reconciliation between one of golf\u2019s ruling bodies and one of its most high-profile performers. In what will not be topped as the shock of this golfing year, the left-handed Mickelson has lauded the USGA for its approach to this, the 119th US Open at Pebble Beach. The five-times major winner, so caustic about what he regarded as ruinous course compositions in the past, performed the epitome of a volte-face. \u201cI have to hand it to the USGA for a great setup,\u201d said Mickelson. \u201cIt\u2019s the best I\u2019ve ever seen. And it\u2019s identifying the best players. It\u2019s making the players the story. \u201cI just think that you\u2019ve got to give credit when they do a good job like this. They\u2019ve done a great job. There have been many times where one or two yards\u2019 difference in hole location would have made a world of difference, given the conditions being so tough. And this week they\u2019ve done a good job in doing that. They\u2019ve really done a great job in letting the players kind of showcase their talents.\u201d It is worth reflecting on the scale of this U-turn. Only last month, Mickelson had fired his latest broadside at the USGA. \u201cI\u2019ve played, what, 29 US Opens,\u201d he said. \u201cOne hundred per cent of the time they have messed it up if it doesn\u2019t rain. The rain is the governor. That\u2019s the only governor they have. And if they don\u2019t have a governor they don\u2019t know how to control themselves.\u201d Mickelson skipped pre-tournament media duties on the Monterey Peninsula, doubtless because he was unwilling to get dragged into the wave of controversy that has dogged recent US Opens until this one. If Mickelson\u2019s California charm offensive is notable because of history, he has not been alone in delivering credit. There has been a general sense the USGA has been fair in its approach to Pebble Beach. Scoring has been good rather than excellent, poor play has been appropriately punished. \u201cI think they\u2019ve done a great job with the golf course,\u201d said Louis Oosthuizen who, unlike Mickelson, found himself still in contention. \u201cIf you don\u2019t drive it good around here or struggle with your iron play, you\u2019re going to struggle. It\u2019s so, so tough, the rough. And you still need to hit fairways, still need to hit greens. It\u2019s nice to see red numbers in a US Open and I think it\u2019s a little bit more exciting.\u201d The bigger picture for Mickelson is that the sands of time have surely run out on his quest to deliver a grand slam of major wins. He has been runner-up or tied second on six occasions at the US Open, the one event of golf\u2019s key quartet to elude him. The last of those finishes was in 2013. Pebble Beach, where Mickelson has won five times in regular competition, looked his last opportunity to complete the set. On the closing day of this US Open Mickelson turned 49. He would inevitably spend it in reflective mood. A California native, Mickelson\u2019s grandfather, Alfred Santos, was a caddie at Pebble Beach when it opened as a course in 1919. \u201cI think that we, as players, need to look back kind of on our career and on our life with a lot of gratitude for the fact that we get to do this for a living,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when I\u2019m here at Pebble Beach, there\u2019s no place that I am more grateful for the life that I\u2019ve been able to lead and my career and my family and so forth. \u201cEspecially going back with my grandfather being here and what this place here at Pebble Beach has meant to me over the years and having so many great moments here. I can\u2019t help but walk this golf course and feel grateful to all the great things in my life. This is a very spiritual place for me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
