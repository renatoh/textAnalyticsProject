But we do need a better sense of citizenship", "bodyText": "I am glad to be a British citizen. I like it here. There are many countries with better weather but few to which I would rather belong. There is much in Britain's past and present to be proud of, as well as some of which we should all be ashamed. However, I don't think of myself as a subject of the Queen - not because I have anything against Her Majesty personally, but because I decline to be subjected to anybody. The great Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt said he wanted on his tombstone the words \"he was nobody's subject\". My sentiments exactly. As for national identity: my emotional and cultural loyalties, the things that make my heart beat quicker, whether in poetry, music, history or sport, are mainly English rather than British. Even when the England team play such feeble rugby, I'm not for a moment tempted to defect to Scotland. But I have several other identities and loyalties, both smaller and larger, from Oxford and London, through Europe and the Anglosphere, all the way to a liberal internationalist sense of being a citizen of the world. How about you? These multiple dimensions both define and complicate the debate about citizenship that has been spluttering away in Britain for at least two decades. Honour should go to the Charter 88 initiative which, in 1988, marking the 300th anniversary of the so-called Glorious Revolution, helped to kick-start a discussion around a more active notion of being citizens rather than mere subjects. It acquired new impetus when New Labour came to power in 1997, soon thereafter commissioning an advisory group on citizenship chaired by the political scientist Bernard Crick. Many elements have fed into the conversation, including the impact of devolution, European integration, immigration, race riots and home-grown jihadist terrorism. Since Gordon Brown became prime minister last summer that conversation has risen to a climax. Not a month passes without some minister, advisory group, thinktank or panjandrum launching some new initiative on \"active citizenship\" (Department for Communities and all that); \"earned citizenship\" (Home Office, for migrants); citizenship with a bill of rights and responsibilities (Ministry of Justice); citizenship with added British values (prime minister); citizenship plus progressive nationalism (David Goodhart of Prospect magazine); citizenship with identity, community cohesion and belonging (Institute for Public Policy Research); citizenship with a small side dish of sharia (Archbishop of Canterbury); citizenship with beef and two veg (Conservative party); citizenship with chips, citizenship with chicken tikka masala. This week has seen the publication of a \"citizenship review\" by the former attorney general, Lord Goldsmith. Over the next few months we are promised a green paper on a bill of rights and responsibilities and what is intended to be a government-initiated national debate on a \"British statement of values\", culminating in a citizens' summit and a proposal to parliament. With all this exhaustive rumination about what it means to be an active British citizen, we scarcely have any time left to be active British citizens. This is nonetheless a crucial debate, and one echoed in many countries around the world. The more diverse your society becomes, the more important it is to spell out what you all have in common. In any nation defined by civic rather than ethnic belonging, citizenship is the key term, and in Britain, unlike in France or the US, our explicit notions of citizenship are underdeveloped. The Goldsmith review has got a very British bum rap in the press, notably for its passing suggestion that everyone might swear an oath of allegiance to Her Majesty, but actually it contains some good stuff. We just need to work out what will fly in Britain and what won't. One approach that won't work in Britain is American-style, hand-on-heart, saluting-the-flag nationalism, complete with a new national day (a suggestion endorsed by Goldsmith) and inculcation of Britishness through an upbeat, semi-mythical version of \"our [heroic] national story\". This won't work because (1) Britain is a nation of four nations; (2) we are in the 21st century, not the 19th; (3) historians shouldn't peddle myths; and (4) we're British, not American. Sorry, Gordon, but forget it. As George Orwell reported hearing a cockney crowd sing in a London pub: \"Anywhere else you can do that there, but you can't do that there 'ere.\" Another non-starter is spreading the oath of allegiance. Goldsmith records what those who acquire British citizenship are currently supposed to swear: \"I, [name], swear by almighty God that on becoming a British citizen I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors according to law ...\" Now I myself am rather attached to the novels of Sir Walter Scott, but in 2008 this is an amazing load of anachronistic bunkum. First of all, let's leave God out of it, shall we? Secondly, what on earth does it mean to \"bear true allegiance\" to Her Majesty, and why should I extend this courtesy to Prince William, let alone Harry? But then it goes on: \"I will give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and respect its rights and freedoms. I will uphold its democratic values. I will observe its laws faithfully and fulfil my duties and obligations as a British citizen.\" Now we're talking. That I would happily and solemnly swear. It's not at all anachronistic to think that we need a clearer statement of the rights and duties of British citizens, strengthening a sense of belonging and mutual obligation. Goldsmith makes a very useful stab at listing what those rights and duties actually are, under current British law. He rightly argues that what we need is not a further attempt to codify legally binding, \"justiciable\" rights and duties, but an explanatory and, so to speak, didactic charter, in plain English. I would add that the proposed statement of values would best appear as a preamble to that charter of rights and duties, rather than as a separate document. The statement of values should not take more than a few paragraphs anyway. After all, two of our most cherished British values are lucidity and brevity. This basic outline of what British citizenship involves should be studied by everyone at their point of entry to full citizenship: particularly at school, for most people; and in the process of acquiring citizenship, for those who arrive in this country later in life or grow up here without citizenship. It should be accompanied by both the requirement and the means to operate effectively in English; mandatory citizenship classes (which the government has instituted, and is trying to improve); and citizenship ceremonies for new citizens, which in some places have already proved effective. Vitally important - and scandalously neglected by this government, as by its predecessors - is basic instruction for all in the history of Britain, including the stories of its constituent nations and communities of migrant origin: not nationalistic myth but solid, critical history. The Goldsmith review also supports the excellent idea of current citizens \"mentoring\" new arrivals, on their journey to citizenship. These are not complicated measures, but they require persistence and imagination to make them real on the streets, where they matter most. After 20 years of debate about active citizenship, perhaps the time has come to discuss less and do more. timothygartonash.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
