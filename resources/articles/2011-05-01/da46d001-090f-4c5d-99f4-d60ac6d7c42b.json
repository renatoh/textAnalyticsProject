In less than two weeks he was convicted by a military court and sentenced to three years' imprisonment (Press freedom setback in Egypt, Media, 14 April). His \"crime\"? Publishing a detailed analysis of the military's collusion with Hosni Mubarak's attempts to crush the recent uprising, and its ongoing involvement in the arrest, detention and torture of protesters. According to Human Rights Watch, at least 75 other protesters remain in detention after unfair trials before military courts held since Mubarak's fall. As Nabil put it: \"The revolution has so far managed to get rid of the dictator but not of the dictatorship.\" This Sunday, as we mark International Conscientious Objectors' Day, we urge all those who have been inspired by the Egyptian uprising to write to the Egyptian ambassador and urge an immediate end to the trials of civilians before military courts and the release of all those, like Nabil, who have been arbitrarily detained or convicted after unfair proceedings. John Pilger, Nadia Idle and Alex Nunns Editors, Tweets from Tahrir: Egypt's revolution as it unfolded, Gabriel Carlyle Peace News \u2022 We denounce the attacks by the Tunisian government and police against demonstrators, journalists and trade unionists. On Friday 6 May and Saturday 7 May, on the Avenue Bourguiba in Tunis, the police charged, savagely beat and gassed peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators, concentrating their attacks on journalists and union activists. The demonstration they attacked was demanding transparency from the government about the influence of pro-Ben Ali conspirators and reports of a possible military coup. The newspaper La Presse, which reported on the police violence, had its offices raided by police thugs. During the raid, police officers beat and severely injured the photojournalist Abdelfattah Belaid. We support the demands of the UGTT trade union federation for democracy, transparent elections and an end to official corruption. We oppose the shameful, anti-democratic abuses of Sebsi's provisional government. We demand that the government order the police to allow future demonstrations to proceed without police attacks, and lift the curfew.
