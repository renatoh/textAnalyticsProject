McRae was livid after seeing his side mauled by Saints and said at the time: \"It's either the same players that are causing the problem or me, and somebody has to go. I've got to get rid of the cancer at the club or take myself out of the situation.\" But yesterday he issued a statement saying: \"I intend to build and strengthen the team until the end of my contract and I look forward to fulfilling all the goals that have been set for at least the next two years.\" Wigan's coach Stuart Raper will take the unusual step of issuing a press release this morning to list the club's injuries, apparently confirming speculation that, for their last game before the play-offs, they will field a skeleton team against Leeds at the JJB Stadium on Friday but try to avoid the fate of St Helens, fined \u00a320,000 when they sent a reserve team to Bradford the week before the Challenge Cup final in April. The Widnes prop Troy Stone will appear at a disciplinary hearing today after he was involved in a rumble at the Jungle with Castleford's Dean Sampson on Sunday. Castleford's coach Graham Steadman described the failure of the referee Richard Silverwood to take action against Stone as \"scandalous\". But Stuart Cummings, the Rugby Football League's technical executive, backed the referee yesterday and insisted that his appointment for Featherstone versus Batley in the Northern Ford Premiership play-offs next weekend was not a demotion. Barrie-Jon Mather, the Cas centre who was an international in both codes, is to retire at the end of the season. The Tigers had not offered him a new contract and have also released Kyle Warren. But they have lost out to Leeds in the battle to sign Andrew Dunemann, Halifax's Australian stand-off, which may leave them with problems at half-back if they cannot persuade Mitch Healey to stay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
