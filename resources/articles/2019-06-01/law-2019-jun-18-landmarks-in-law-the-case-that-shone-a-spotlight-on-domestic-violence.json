Her subsequent appeal changed the way that the concept of \u201cprovocation\u201d was applied, and helped shift the attitude of English courts and the public on the impact of domestic violence on women who kill. It led to the later freeing of two other women \u2013 Emma Humphreys and Sara Thornton \u2013 and was also relied on in the recent case of Sally Challen, who this year successfully appealed against her conviction for murdering her coercive and controlling husband. At the age of 23, Ahluwalia was pushed into an arranged marriage. She gave up studying law and moved to England from India with her husband, Deepak, in 1979. For 10 years she endured violence, rape and sexual abuse from her controlling husband who treated her like a slave. When she could stand it no longer, she set fire to his bedclothes while he slept. Although she had not intended to kill him, he died 10 days later and she was charged with his murder. Her plea of manslaughter due to provocation was rejected. The jury found her guilty of murder and she was sentenced to life in prison. Ahluwalia recalls: \u201cWhen I got my life sentence and my trial solicitor said there were no grounds of appeal, that was a big blow. I had no lawyer, no family, I ended up with a life sentence. I lost everything.\u201d After a couple of days, she wrote to Pragna Patel, director of the campaigning charity Southall Black Sisters, which this year celebrates its 40th anniversary of fighting for women\u2019s rights. The group, backed by Justice for Women, won an appeal in 1992 on the grounds that expert evidence and psychiatric reports had not been presented at the original trial. After a retrial, Ahluwalia was found guilty of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility. She was sentenced to three years and four months in prison \u2013 the time she had already served \u2013 and was released immediately. Her story was made into the 2006 film Provoked, starring Aishwarya Rai and Miranda Richardson. At the time of her trial, her plea of provocation \u2013 which is a partial defence to murder \u2013 failed because the law demanded an immediate incident of provocation that acted as a trigger to a loss of self-control. In her case, a few hours had elapsed between her husband\u2019s last attack and her act of retaliation, which was deemed to be a \u201ccooling down\u201d period and not a \u201cboiling over\u201d period, as her defence suggested. Ahluwalia\u2019s case, says Harriet Wistrich, director of Justice for Women, was one of a series of important cases in the early 90s that brought to the fore the issue of victims of domestic violence who kill. \u201cIn legal terms these cases brought changes to the defence of provocation by introducing such concepts as slow-burn provocation and cumulative provocation,\u201d she says. Wistrich explains that they highlighted the fact that the provocation defence had been designed to assist men who lost control and responded with anger. Meanwhile, women were more likely to endure abusive conduct over a longer period, which would accumulate to a stage when they would ultimately lose control. As Patel explains: \u201cThe discriminatory law was based on male standards of behaviour and did not allow for the examination of the abusive, coercive, controlling and constraining context in which abused women kill. Nor did it allow for the very real social, cultural and economic reasons that can prevent exit from abuse.\u201d The case, says Patel, was not just about differences in physical strength and ways in which anger or rage is built up. It was about the social and political realities in which men and women find themselves, and the failure of state agencies to take domestic violence and abuse seriously. \u201cWe were not asking for a licence to kill, but for the contexts in which abused women kill to be better understood,\u201d she says. The groundbreaking case, says Patel, \u201cshone a spotlight on domestic violence in South Asian communities and helped to create awareness of how the patriarchal concepts of honour and shame silence South Asian women\u201d. The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 abolished the defence of provocation and replaced it with loss of control, which, says Patel, \u201cbetter reflects women\u2019s reality while not being lenient on men who claim that they lost self-control due to adultery or in anger\u201d. Despite an improved awareness and response to abused women, Patel insists that the criminal justice system continues to reflect gender bias in the laws of self-defence. But, she adds, the recent case of Challen has helped to develop an even greater judicial and societal awareness of the concepts of coercion and control as a form of domestic abuse. As Wistrich points out, a lot of the facts of Ahluwalia\u2019s case were mirrored in Challen\u2019s. \u201cIf the words and framework were there at the time, [Ahluwalia\u2019s case] would also have been described as a coercive and controlling relationship,\u201d she suggests. Thirty years on, Ahluwalia reflects: \u201cIt all seems like a bad dream \u2026 People now understand more about the abuse that goes on. Women have started coming out because they know now that there is help.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
