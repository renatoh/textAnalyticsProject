This new-look rivalry continues to capture the imagination of a legion of fans who this year are not lamenting the loss of past legends, but counting down to Game One with the excitement of the unknown. The 2019 series has already provided its fair share of pre-contest drama and coaching challenges. It\u2019s had everything from national anthem debates to alleged sex tape sabotage. Not the ideal lead up to the code\u2019s premier contest, but arguably the perfect crescendo to kick off the opening game \u2013 and definitely the kind of fodder which will fuel Origin\u2019s signature passion for disliking the opposition. For second-time NSW head coach, Brad Fittler, the selection process brought about the need to find replacements for the unavailable Jack de Belin and the injured Tom Trbojevic. But the bigger headache was the prospect of heading into the series with the most undesirable of concerns \u2013 underperforming halves. Across the border, coach Kevin Walters had his own set of troubles following the retirement of some of the game\u2019s biggest superstars. With a steely resolve, the former player declared \u201cwar\u201d on his southern opponents last week, going as far as banning his team from mentioning them in conversation or interview and reportedly hiring a $5,000-an-hour speaker to motivate his side. With mind-games at the top of the order for Queensland, the picture is in contrast down south with the comparatively laid-back Fittler at the helm. The former NSW Origin great had his team run through drills on Bondi Beach, declaring the Blues\u2019 motto for 2019 \u201cDo you believe?\u201d It\u2019s a proven mantra which served Fittler well when he blooded three rookies last year, with great success. With their first series under their belt, Josh Addo-Carr, Latrell Mitchell and Damien Cook now threaten to defy their relative inexperience and individually blow the game apart on Wednesday. Fittler will now apply this formula to his newest breed of Blues: Cameron Murray, Cody Walker, Nick Cotric, Jack Wighton and Payne Haas. While each has made serious claims to break into the side, the net result is that NSW will be chancing nearly a third of its team on the uninitiated. Of particular interest will be new five-eighth Walker, who has been given the task of partnering Cleary in the halves and Haas, who is making a meteoric rise to the ranks of NSW with only 10 NRL games to his credit, but will be asked to face-off against his regular Broncos teammates. Queensland\u2019s debutants (Moses Mbye, David Fifita and fellow Bronco Joe Ofahengaue) have been restricted to the interchange bench. However, like NSW, the Maroons will also field a new halves pairing and have the added concern of captain Daly Cherry-Evans not having taken the field since round seven with a syndesmosis injury. The move will force regular half Ben Hunt into a makeshift hooker and a likely target for NSW\u2019s heavy forward traffic. Both states have approached experience in a similar fashion; the Maroons have seasoned Origin utility Matt Gillett recalled into the side, providing much-valued experience in the second row, while NSW selectors have called upon 32-year-old Josh Morris, this being the centre\u2019s first Origin since 2016. It is undeniable that both teams boast an appetising array of key ingredients which have pundits talking: two dynamic fullbacks; trusty veteran centres; un-tried halves pairings; and big young guns in the forward pack who only know one direction. There have been injury concerns involving both camps, adding further speculation over preparations and the outcome of the all-important opener. To think that only 34 points separate the two teams over 37 Origin series shows just how close this contest has been over time and gives reason to why this epic state battle eclipses any national representative match in popularity and number of TV eyeballs. The stage is set at Suncorp Stadium, league\u2019s most intimidating and stirring amphitheatre, and it may be that the location might just prove the difference. The coaching masterminds, who share Origin legend status, are furiously reinforcing different sets of plans which demand the most precise execution coupled with the reward of early supremacy. It\u2019s not billed as an Origin of the ages, but this is Origin of the new age. Let the game begin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
