The officer was named as PC Chris Roberts, 47. He had been called to an alleged incident of domestic violence in Wembley, north-west London, and died minutes after helping to arrest a man. Scotland Yard yesterday confirmed that he was not assaulted by the suspect during the incident. A postmortem examination yesterday gave the cause of death as heart disease and police said it was believed that he had a pre-existing coronary condition. PC Roberts, who worked with a 24-hour response team based at Wembley, joined the Metropolitan police in 1983. Sir Ian Blair, the Met commissioner, said: \"I am deeply saddened by the death of one of my officers, a father of three, while on duty and my thoughts go out to his family, friends and colleagues, especially at this time of year.\" The officer died after being called to a home in Brinkburn Gardens at about 5.45pm on Boxing Day. A man in his 30s was arrested and was being questioned yesterday. It is understood that PC Roberts collapsed following the arrest and despite attempts to revive him was pronounced dead at hospital. Jan Berry, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: \"This is another tragedy where a police officer has paid the ultimate sacrifice. Police officers never know what dangers they may face when out on patrol. Regrettably, the service has lost another valued colleague.\" Detectives will examine whether CS spray which police used during the incident may have contributed to PC Roberts's death. A nearby resident, who gave his name as Nicky, said he had become aware of the incident at 6pm: \"There were a lot of police and a lot of noise. I saw two paramedic cars and two ambulances. You could see there was someone on the ground and there were people around him.\" Daniel Riordan, 77, who has lived in the cul-de-sac for 38 years, said he had seen a man being arrested at the rented property. Two police officers had been restraining him, he said. The Home Office minister Tony McNulty joined the tributes to the dead officer: \"I am deeply saddened to learn of the death of a police officer while on duty with the Metropolitan police ... This is a tragic event and I offer my deepest sympathy to the officer's family, friends and colleagues.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
