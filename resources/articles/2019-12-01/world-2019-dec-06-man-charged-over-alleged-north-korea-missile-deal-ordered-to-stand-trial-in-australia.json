But Justice Ian Harrison, in the New South Wales supreme court, dismissed the Chan Han Choi\u2019s application for a permanent stay of proceedings, saying he will stand trial next February. Choi, 61, is the first person ever charged with offences under Australia\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Act, alleged to have been a sanctions-busting \u201ceconomic agent\u201d of Pyongyang and of working to broker missile technology and resources deals on behalf of the North Korean regime. He has told the court he is a political prisoner incarcerated because of his socialist political beliefs. Choi, brought to court in handcuffs wearing a green prison tracksuit, was arrested in December 2017 and charged over alleged attempts to broker coal deals to raise money for the North Korean regime as well as selling weapons technology, including equipment for missiles. An affidavit presented to the court argued his ability to prepare a defence is hampered because he cannot speak freely to his lawyer. The affidavit included written confirmation from NSW corrective services commissioner Peter Severin that authorities \u201cdrop in\u201d to listen to Choi\u2019s calls from prison, but only \u201cto ensure they are in English and with approved contacts\u201d. Severin said the drop-ins were brief and not recorded, and were required for \u201cnational security interest\u201d cases such as Choi\u2019s. The affidavit also argues that when Choi was arrested, then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull commented on the case, drawing significant negative public attention. Turnbull said Choi had been \u201carrested and will be charged with offences relating to breaking sanctions and endeavouring \u2013 by breaking sanctions \u2013 to provide economic support for the North Korean regime. These are very, very serious matters. North Korea is a dangerous, reckless, criminal regime, threatening the peace of the region\u201d. A separate affidavit said the translator he was provided with was unable to properly translate for him, and another Korean speaker could not be found who had sufficient security clearance. Justice Harrison, in the NSW supreme court, dismissed Choi\u2019s application for a permanent stay of his trial. Choi has been refused bail, with prosecutors arguing he has international connections and poses a flight risk. Choi will seek to apply for bail again ahead of his trial, set to commence in February. At a demonstration supporting Choi held outside the NSW supreme court, Praba Balasubramaniam, from the Trotskyist Platform, said Choi was a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d, charged for resisting \u201ccruel\u201d economic sanctions imposed on North Korea that were designed to starve the people of that country. \u201cChoi is being persecuted because of his political views. \u201cIt\u2019s clear he cannot get a fair trial in this country.\u201d In a message recorded in prison and broadcast outside the court, Choi said: \u201c[I] would like to express my appreciation and sincere gratitude for all the support I have received. \u201cI honestly believe that every human being deserve basic human rights and I have been deprived of those rights through my incarceration. \u201cI strongly believe that the United Nations economic sanctions imposed on North Korea are both unjust and unfair,\u201d he said. The Guardian has seen a police statement of alleged facts tendered to the court ahead of his trial. These have not been tested in court and have not been agreed to by Choi\u2019s defence. Born in the South Korean capital Seoul, Choi emigrated to Australia in 1987 and became a citizen in 2001. The statement alleges Choi used a web of black market contacts in Syria, Taiwan, Cambodia and Russia to broker deals mostly in coal and iron, but also in weapons technology, including short-range missiles. The statement cites Choi\u2019s regular overseas travel, including to North Korea, and alleged email correspondence that reveals a declared loyalty to the North Korean regime. An email allegedly from the regime praised Choi\u2019s devotion and willingness to \u201cwork hard for our country\u201d. \u201cEven when you are far away from our country, in your heart there is the country, so I am certain that your project will run successfully,\u201d the email, sent in July 2013, allegedly said of Choi. The police statement alleges Choi, who used the pseudonym Solomon in his negotiations, developed a code to discuss weapons sales on the phone, referring to missiles as \u201cpine trees\u201d and missile factories as \u201cnurseries\u201d. According to the police allegations, Choi described himself as North Korea\u2019s \u201cinternational commerce\u201d liaison, working on behalf of the highest echelons of the DPRK government. \u201cI am a recognised strategist that has favour with Kim Jong Eun [sic],\u201d he wrote. When Choi was arrested, Australian federal police assistant commissioner Neil Gaughan stressed Choi was not alleged to have engaged in spying, but simply to have tried to raise money for the North Korean regime. Gaughan said evidence suggested Choi had been in contact \u201cwith high-ranking North Korean officials\u201d but did not provide details. \u201cWe believe this man participated in discussions about the sale of missile componentry from North Korea to other entities abroad.\u201d Gaughan would not identify the alleged international entities or their location, but said there were no governments or government officials involved."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
