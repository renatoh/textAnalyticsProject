The letter encourages both parties to \"negotiate together for a fair and equitable multi-challenger competition\". A spokesman for the Californian club said: \"We are very pleased that they are putting pressure on us both.\" The former trustees (past winners of the Cup), led by the New York Yacht Club, believe that the competition they urge, similar to those held almost exclusively since 1970, is for the benefit of all concerned, rather than a one-on-one battle in massive multihulls. Members of Bertarelli's Alinghi team have indicated that nothing other than a direct response to Ellison's challenge with a 90-foot trimaran will suffice. Yet both Ellison and Bertarelli have clearly stated in the past that they would prefer a multi-challenger event. Meanwhile, 17 teams, including Britain's TeamOrigin led by Sir Keith Mills, await an early decision in order to make their plans for an assault on sailing's premier prize."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
