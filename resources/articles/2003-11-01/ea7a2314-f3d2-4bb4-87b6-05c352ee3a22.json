Humbled and humiliated, the visitors' heady expectation after their first-leg victory was drowned in a cauldron of oranje to ensure that Holland, strutting where they had briefly stuttered, secured passage to Portugal. The Tartan hordes who had arrived praying for a miracle instead endured a masterclass conducted by Wesley Sneijder and appreciated by Ruud van Nistelrooy. The striker's hat-trick amounted to half Holland's total, though so dismissive had the hosts become by the final whistle that Scotland's pre-match optimism seemed ridiculous. After the astounding if unlikely victory at Hampden Park, such an excruciatingly one-sided match was an anti-climax. The Scots were as abysmal here as they had been impressive on Saturday, as the chasm in quality - bridged briefly on Clydeside - gaped horrendously wide. \"I'm not shocked,\" insisted Berti Vogts, his blanched appearance suggesting otherwise. \"But, at the moment, they were the best defenders available. \"I know the players available for Scotland and, with a few of the Under-21s thrown in and the injured players back, that's the group which will go into World Cup qualifying. I'm embarrassed and so are my players, but I'm not blaming any of them. Yes, there were mistakes, but there was a massive difference in quality there.\" That should not excuse this desperate exhibition of defending, though the gulf had been evident at times in the first leg. Holland simply proved more ruthless in front of their own crowd. Had the Scots held back the tide in the first 20 minutes, home nerves might have surfaced; instead the pressure was relieved by the quarter-hour. By the interval the game, and the tie, had been lost. Integral to it all was Sneijder. The 19-year-old was making only his third international appearance, having been omitted at Hampden. With the suspended Christian Dailly scowling in the dug-out and Gavin Rae never able to replicate the West Ham man's defensive midfield shield, the youngster ran riot. \"He's a talent, someone who is able to shift the game so quickly,\" said Dick Advocaat, who will remain in charge of Holland until after the finals next summer. \"He was outstanding tonight.\" Sneijder it was who accepted possession and turned exhilaratingly - if far too easily - from Neil McCann, ambling forward before firing a low shot across Rab Douglas and into the corner of the net from the edge of the area. This was a wonderfully fluid Dutch line-up, revelling in the freedom their formation granted and liberated from the restrictive system favoured by Advocaat in Glasgow. Faced by buzzing urgency, Scotland simply could not cope. The lunging tackles which bit leather on Saturday crunched into limbs this time around, with four Scots booked before half-time. The fouls brought more than disciplinary problems. Jackie McNamara tripped Marc Overmars on the corner of the area and Sneijder lashed over a free-kick too elusive for Lee Wilkie, Steven Pressley and Douglas, and Andre Ooijer, leaping up hindered, flicked home from point-blank range. Sneijder had battered another breathless shot just wide before McNamara conceded another free-kick on the flank. If only for variety, the teenager aimed for Van Nistelrooy and he nodded in the third. \"We have to learn from that style of football,\" said Vogts. \"We can't play two matches in four days against such a strong team and compete.\" That much was obvious, particularly as simplicity rather than mind-boggling skill had long proved sufficient for the Dutch to flourish. Van Nistelrooy, twisting the knife, walked in the fourth just after the interval, exchanging passes with Rafael van der Vaart before breezing beyond Wilkie and lobbing Douglas. Heaping misery upon misery, Sneijder's corner was eased beyond the Celtic goalkeeper at the near post by Frank de Boer and, with all semblance of defensive organisation long since evaporated, Van Nistelrooy sidefooted home the sixth Andy van der Meyde's centre. The hat-trick took his tally of international goals to 14; as Sneijder curled against the crossbar, Scotland appeared well capable of conceding as many. Crushing defeat will not deflect Vogts in his attempts to haul the national side out of the doldrums, though this was a painful reminder of how far the Scots have still to go. Failure to reach a third successive major championships will hurt the SFA coffers as well as the country. \"I've told my boys I'm proud of them, but there is a lot of work ahead,\" added Vogts - though not, regrettably, in Portugal next summer.
