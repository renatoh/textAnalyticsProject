The international phenomenon of teen YouTube stars is, by now, well-trodden ground \u2013 but who are the young YouTube superstars in Australia, and what are they peddling? It happens to us all: one day, we wake up and realise that we\u2019re no longer at the crest of the internet wave. For some of us, this can be shattering. I realised my ship had begun to sail when, late last year, I attended a local wrestling promotion. After the show, two young women hopped on stage and had an impromptu photoshoot with the championship belts. It was only after I grumbled something about the rudeness of youths and how nobody would let me touch the belt that I was helpfully informed, by a very excited fan, that the two women were YouTube superstars, in town for the online video expo VidCon. Upon my return home I looked up their YouTube accounts. Between them, they had upwards of 3.5 million subscribers, countless views, astronomical amounts of \u201cthumbs ups\u201d ... and, in a moment a Wonder Years voiceover would pinpoint as watershed, I struggled to understand why. \u201cBut they\u2019re just talking about stuff!\u201d I whined to a friend, their eyes glazing steadily. \u201cDo people really watch this??\u201d At the age of 36, the generation gap had yawned open before me. How do you do, fellow kids? I attacked my problem with an anthropological zeal, and went straight to the source: the Young People all around me, both viewers and content creators. I wanted to better understand the viewing habits of those for whom \u201cfunny cats\u201d compilations and jokes about Marxism (oh, how I laughed!) were no longer cutting it. (My 15-year-old friend Isaac generously reassured me, \u201cI don\u2019t think that \u2018grownups\u2019 are a group that inherently can\u2019t understand certain things.\u201d) A handful of Australian YouTubers have enjoyed immense success beyond the boundaries of the site, from Troye Sivan to SketchShe, but there are plenty who are uploading content consumed by a mind-boggling number of viewers, often multiple times a week. Exact numbers regarding exactly what young people are watching are closely guarded by Google, but by reverse engineering view counts and subscriber numbers for some of Australia\u2019s more popular YouTube accounts, it\u2019s safe to assume that many young people, both here and abroad, are eating the content up. (On that note, many of the Australian YouTubers I spoke to suggested large slices of their audiences are from overseas, while the young Australian viewers also mainly watched international accounts. \u201cI mostly like to watch people from other countries to see what they like and how they do things over in their part of the world,\u201d said Edie, 13, who also enjoys hearing different accents; there are likely great swaths of teens in places like Manchester, Atlanta or Yokohama who are, right now, thrilling to the mangled vowel sounds of the Australian accounts I explored.) My travels through young YouTube were eye-opening, and while I might not necessarily be signing up for a triple helping of certain types of content each week, at least the next time a YouTube superstar crosses my path I\u2019ll be able to nod knowingly and say, \u201cAh, yes, I\u2019ve seen their channel.\u201d Wengie Genre: Lifestyle Most popular video: 42m views Subscribers: 10.8 million Officially Australia\u2019s most-popular YouTuber as of late 2017, the channel of rainbow-haired Wengie is like a Lisa Frank Trapper Keeper come to life. Through her channel I have learned that \u201cpranks\u201d no longer necessarily means \u201cjumping out of a bin and scaring your friends\u201d \u2013 nor does it always mean the more sinister \u201cpranks\u201d of the disgraced YouTuber Logan Paul, whose video of an alleged suicide victim \u2013 uploaded to his 15.6 million, mostly-teen viewers \u2013 resulted in official reprimanding by YouTube. Now, the word \u201cprank\u201d also means making edible school supplies and worms, so that you can \u201cprank\u201d your friend by seemingly eating pencils in front of them. I meditate on Isaac\u2019s reassuring line about grownups not getting things, and move on. RackaRacka Genre: Comedy Most popular video: 55m views Subscribers: 4.5 million I\u2019ll just say it: the Adelaide-based comedy collective RackaRacka\u2019s WrestleMania video is one of the finest works of satire in years. Like South Park\u2019s Emmy-winning episode Make Love Not Warcraft, it is funny on two levels: amusingly ridiculous to those who\u2019ve never partaken in WWE product, and sidesplitting to those who know the tropes of \u201csports entertainment\u201d. As I wandered through the Philippou brothers\u2019 (many) videos, I did wonder if it was a case of lightning striking once \u2013 but then remembered a common theme among the responses from young YouTube viewers: this humour is not made for me. Archie, 20, reckons the rapid-fire editing of much online comedy (and present in many of RackaRacka\u2019s videos) \u201cisn\u2019t always understood by older people\u201d \u2013 a position echoed by Michelle, 19, who told me, \u201cIf you\u2019re not down with internet culture you won\u2019t necessarily understand YouTube culture either.\u201d Bella Fiori Genre: Beauty (... and murder mysteries) Most popular video: 4.1m views Subscribers: 1.5 million Who knew strobe cream and the Lake Bodom murders would one day go hand in hand? Bella Fiori\u2019s account is a fascinating testament to the \u201cmultiple tabs open\u201d mindset: she\u2019s a cruelty-free beauty blogger who tests out new makeup products, posts \u201chaul\u201d videos and vlogs about her holiday trips, but who also uploads in-depth videos about missing persons and murder mysteries each Monday. It raises the question: did she see beauty vlogging as a way to crack the market, and then use her profile to become an investigative journalist? If so, I\u2019d like to shake both her hands. Grace\u2019s World Genre: Toys/lifestyle Most popular video: 60m views Subscribers: 1.1 million If you time-travelled to 1993 and told me and my best friend that our \u201cBarbie videos\u201d might one day translate into YouTube superstardom, we probably would have looked very confused. But 12-year-old Grace Mulgrew is one of YouTube\u2019s \u201cchild influencers\u201d; her episodic Barbie videos are so popular internationally she now also runs a Spanish-language channel as well as a more casual vlogging channel, Grace\u2019s Room. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking to start a channel,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWhen I was six, I loved playing with dolls and I\u2019d been starting to watch YouTube videos so I asked my dad to film me doing a tour of my doll house. When I finished I asked him to put it up on YouTube. We forgot all about it after that, but 10 months later someone pointed out that it had about 9 million views, so we thought we\u2019d make more videos. And the rest is history!\u201d Grace\u2019s World is now so popular that her dad, Greg, quit his job to help manage it. Somewhere, my father is weeping with regret. Muselk Genre: Gaming Most popular video: 11m views Subscribers: 4.3 million Across all the young people I spoke to for this piece, nearly every one of them \u2013 from nine-year-old Milli to 15-year-old Isaac \u2013 watched gaming videos, though few of them self-identified as \u201cgamers\u201d. \u201cWhat I most enjoy about watching gaming videos is not the game itself,\u201d explains Edie, 13, \u201cbut rather the players having fun and laughing over their mistakes, or some funny reaction they\u2019ve had while playing the game.\u201d (Isaac even cops to enjoying \u201cvideos of people just talking about what games they like\u201d, revealing a saintlike patience not just for \u201cgrownups\u201d but also for water-cooler chat.) While I\u2019m not immune to the charms of a Mickey Mouse in the Castle of Illusion boss playthrough, videos like Muselk\u2019s, which feature sardonic live commentary as he and his friends play with or against each other, gave me flashbacks to unsuccessful Friday-night raids in World of Warcraft. This seems to be a common generational issue when it comes to gamer vids; Gabe, 10, complains that: \u201cDad says [UK YouTubers] Dan and Phil are stupid, and they are really funny!\u201d The war continues ... CKN Toys Genre: Toys/unboxing Most popular video: 253m views Subscribers: 5.4 million My first exposure to toy videos on YouTube was via a friend who\u2019d become a father, who remarked that his young daughter was \u201cobsessed\u201d with watching Kinder Surprise unwrapping videos. CKN Toys, a family of YouTubers from Melbourne, do exactly that: crack open surprise eggs and \u201cunbox\u201d newly released toys \u2013 and unlike many popular international unboxing channels, CKN is actually presented by children. As someone who can no longer justify her expenditure in the toy aisle at Kmart, I freely admit to being fascinated by unboxing videos as a hallmark of late capitalism. This suggests, perhaps, that a large slice of the audience for channels like CKN Toys may more likely be comprised of people like me than those who you\u2019d assume to be their prime audience. At least as far as Olli, 11, is concerned, who declares all toy videos to be \u201cthe worst scum in the history of the galaxy\u201d. Her little sister Henri, five, disagrees, assuring me that \u201ctoy videos are my favourite\u201d. Perhaps this is why CKN Toys have comments turned off on many videos. Mighty Car Mods Genre: Automotive Most popular video: 6.9m views Subscribers: 2.6 million The MCM guys may no longer be considered \u201cyoung people\u201d, though they certainly were when they began their channel in 2007, and their audience remains full of youthful enthusiasts. Moog and Marty, who have undertaken enough \u201cautomotive projects\u201d to release a 10th anniversary coffee table book, are aware of the dangers that come with role-model status. \u201cI am conscious that there are a lot of people watching from very diverse backgrounds and there are some sensitivities that I think anyone in the public eye needs to take into consideration,\u201d says Blair \u201cMoog\u201d Joscelyne, one half of MCM alongside Martin \u201cMarty\u201d Mulholland\u2019. \u201cA lot of children are watching, but I don\u2019t think you can necessarily creatively cater to their specific needs, because then another group will feel a shift in the tone of what you\u2019re creating.\u201d They needn\u2019t worry about tailoring their content to suit me, however, because as compelling and entertaining as I find their videos (especially the \u201cfeature-length\u201d projects), I can\u2019t drive. Superwog Genre: Comedy Most popular video: 8m views Subscribers: 853,000 Following in the footsteps of the Wogs Out of Work and Fat Pizza crews in translating grassroots success into (possible) television fame, Theo and Naithan Saidden have parlayed their YouTube channel (mostly sketches, and rap videos inspired by the US channel Epic Rap Battles of History) into a TV-length pilot. Of all the Australian YouTubers, Superwog seemed to be the one with the broadest reach; YouTube fans Gabe, nine, and Edie, 13, were well across it. It\u2019s just as crass (and frequently hilarious) as their aforementioned forebears, but when it comes down to it, I\u2019d rather see the Greek-Egyptian Saiddens skewering Australian multiculturalism than, say, FriendlyJordies\u2019 strangely classist and very white Chronicles of Yilmaz. (Also, I get it: my mum was once on Acropolis Now.) Tammy Hembrow Genre: Lifestyle/fitness Most popular video: 9.6m views Subscribers: 1.1 million Even as someone desperately trying to increase glute strength, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to work out why Tammy Hembrow\u2019s \u201cBigger Booty Workout\u201d is about to crack the 10m view mark. Unlike many other \u201cfitspo\u201d vloggers, however, the 23-year-old Australian-Trinidadian Hembrow\u2019s commitment to keeping things raw (and, when her children are around, chaotic) is a refreshing change from workout videos where the vloggers never break a sweat and cut away before the point of muscle failure. (Don\u2019t look for sweat or muscle crampsshakes on Instagram, however, where she has 8.1 million followers and a far more manicured presence.) Georgia Productions Genre: Lifestyle/comedy Most popular video: 3.2m views Subscribers: 253,000 Georgia is a 17-year-old self-described \u201caspiring YouTuber\u201d whose \u201crandom and relatable\u201d videos speak, presumably, directly to her peers. (Given the production values of Georgia\u2019s productions, once she is no longer \u201caspiring\u201d she\u2019s likely to be producing major live television events.) She has made a number of videos speaking to the difference between Australian and international teens, which reminds me of something Edie told me: \u201cI adore the way [YouTube] lets you watch people from all over the place doing what they love, whether it be humour, adventure, story, make up, gaming or any other type of videos, and being able to share it with us so we can have a good time watching it.\u201d Who can argue with that?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
