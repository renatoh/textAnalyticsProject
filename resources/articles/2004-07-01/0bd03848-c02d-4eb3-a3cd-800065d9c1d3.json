The US Open champion had just played his second shot to Troon's 12th green when Robert Allenby, following suit, went right off line and crashed his approach against the rough-hewn stone wall guarding the Glasgow to Ayr railway, about 20 yards to the right of the pin. Goosen, who would never do anything so unusual, stood and watched while Allenby's ball rebounded from the wall and, as if spring-loaded, bounced across the fringe and up on to the green, coming to rest about 8ft from the flag. It might have gone anywhere. Instead it presented the Australian with a decent birdie chance. By contrast, Goosen had to work hard for the one birdie that came his way in yesterday's second round. He had to work hard for most of the 17 pars, too. And he had to work hardest of all to avoid conceding a single stroke during the round. It was worth watching because luck has nothing to do with his success, and yesterday's round was a minor triumph of sustained professionalism. If you were told to come up with the formula for a typical Goosen round, it would probably be something like the figures that inched him up the Open leader board yesterday. Taken at face value, they suggest a combination of unshakeable steadiness and remorseless efficiency, with just one moment of inspiration to lift him clear of the ordinary. But if Goosen's round lacked explicit drama or peculiar trousers, it contained plenty of fine golf from the 35-year-old South African, much of it on the inward half, when the wind was at its fiercest. Time and again he battled to make his par, and time and again he pulled it off. When he set off just before eight o'clock, he and his partners, Allenby and Jay Haas, had the distinction of being the only group whose individual members had all completed their first rounds in better than regulation figures. As they walked down the 1st fairway a light breeze was coming off the sea, as it had done the previous day. The sun was already shining, the skylarks were singing above the dunes, and another day of low scores looked in prospect. So it went until they arrived at the 4th, with Allenby having just improved his position by one stroke. But somewhere along that 560-yard, par-five hole, the conditions changed utterly. From its original vector, a shade north of westerly, the wind moved so far round that it was coming from the south-west, strengthening noticeably as it attacked the remaining holes from a variety of more or less oblique angles. \"That made it quite difficult,\" Goosen said afterwards. \"We were not really playing any holes straight downwind or straight into the wind, so it was tough to get the right shape to hit the right shot.\" Haas was the first to feel the damage, putting his tee shot into a bunker at the short 5th and missing a 2ft par putt. Goosen and Allenby both found themselves in the sand traps at the long 6th, but only the Australian paid the price. The South African used the opportunity to make the first of several outstanding recoveries, blasting out of the bunker and two-putting from 35ft. Hitting a five-iron off the elevated tee at the 7th, followed by a nine-iron to 5ft, Goosen picked up his only stroke of the round. At the Postage Stamp his ball rolled off the green and into the rough at the bottom of the steep bank to the right of the hole, but a perfectly judged lob enabled him to get up and down. All three players missed the green at the 9th, but only Goosen moved on without dropping a shot after chipping up to the two-tier putting surface. \"That was a good save,\" he said later, which is about as close to flamboyant rhetoric as he gets. If he was not making the long putts, neither was he giving anything away, and the clarity and economy of his play came into even sharper relief as Allenby's Open fell apart at the 12th. Only a couple of minutes after his stroke of outrageous luck at the Railway hole, the Australian four-putted for a triple-bogey seven. Dropping further shots at the 14th and 15th, he suddenly acquired the look of a trauma victim. Goosen saved par at the 15th after chopping the ball out of the left rough across to the long stuff on the opposite side of the fairway. In the sand off the 16th tee, he recovered well yet again. At the short 17th he sank his par putt from 20ft, and he produced his best shot of the round in front of the grandstands on the 18th hole when he took out a sand wedge, climbed down into the bunker to the right of the green, and punched a superb low shot to within 12 inches of the cup. Such an impressively composed response to pressure formed the perfect end to a round containing much more effort and substance than the bare figures might suggest. While Haas was dropping five strokes and Allenby six, Goosen kept his nerve and held his technique together in the hours when the day's conditions were at their most awkward. \"I'm happy with my round today,\" he said afterwards. \"I'm in a position to play well at the weekend and I think I won't be far off the lead come the end of the day. It was nice to stay in the hunt.\" Commanding respect rather than affection, with no discernible quirks or affectations to mark him out, Goosen will always find it difficult to sell himself to a wider audience. Perhaps the very idea is of no interest to him. But it will be no surprise if, come tomorrow afternoon, he is to be found near the head of the pack. Mickelson lifted by early birdies Phil Mickelson got back into contention at Troon yesterday with birdies at four of the first six holes of his second round. And the American shot another birdie on the 16th to finish on 66. \"Well, it was a wonderful round. I was very pleased the way I got off to a quick start,\" he said. \"You have to make birdies on the first nine holes here and I made it on four of them. \"I fought hard on the back and made some really good pars with some really good putts.\" Ernie Els was keen to get back on the practice putting green despite remaining in contention for a second Open title in three years. The South African said he felt \"frustrated\" after shooting a second two-under-par 69. \"I can't be too hard on myself because I am four under par, but I would love to make some more putts - you'll see a smile on my face then. I am heading to the practice green to try and sort it out.\" Vijay Singh, another of the favourites for the Open, is determined to stay in contention this weekend. The Fijian shot a second-round 70 for a halfway total of 138. \"I don't know if I am owed one [a major] but I know I have to go out there and grab it,\" he said. \"I am in a great position again this week . . . I feel like I have a good chance on Sunday.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
