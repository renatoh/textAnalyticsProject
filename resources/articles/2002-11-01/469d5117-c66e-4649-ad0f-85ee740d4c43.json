Mr Strachan's long-expected appointment ends speculation over whether his personal relationship with arts minister Tessa Blackstone would disqualify him for the job. The Conservative party has described Mr Strachan's move to the public spending watchdog as \"singularly inappropriate\" on the grounds that a partner of a government minister should not be placed at the head of an organisation with a politically impartial role. But the government has been determined to reject charges of cronyism, arguing that Mr Strachan, a former investment banker, has been chosen through an independent selection process operating under Nolan rules - the standards for public life. The commission is responsible for ensuring \u00a3120bn of public money is spent efficiently in 13,000 bodies straddling the NHS, local government, housing and the criminal justice system. Mr Strachan said he was determined to \"develop and protect\" the commission's reputation as a \"staunchly independent regulator\". His arrival comes as the commission prepares to deliver its first set of local authority league tables, expected in December. These are expected to reveal a number of poor performing councils, many of them Labour. In the medium-term he will help oversee the creation of the new health inspectorate, the commission for healthcare audit and inspection, which will incorporate the audit commission's high profile value for money research. Audit commission controller, Sir Andrew Foster, said: \"James Strachan could not be joining us at a more critical or appropriate time. The public services face major challenges over the coming years as they seek to deliver improvements for the benefit of users.\" Mr Strachan, who is deaf, worked in the City for 14 years before moving into the voluntary sector in 1994. In 1997 he became chief executive of RNID, with whom he will stay on as chairman of the board of truees."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
