This also nodded, once again, specifically to the Texan\u2019s brilliance. On the birthday of the late, great Seve Ballesteros, the 21-year-old Spieth produced a showing which the Spaniard would surely have graced with his approval. Augusta\u2019s crowds roared in delight. There was entertainment to match scoring. The best news? This is only the start. Any surprise attached to Spieth\u2019s 64 is unnecessary. He had, after all, finished no worse than second in his three PGA Tour events immediately before this major. At Augusta a year ago he was a genuine contender up until the closing stretch of Sunday holes. Spieth has already shown himself a rapid learner. Age, though, attaches context. When Woods won his first Masters, Spieth had not yet turned four. Spieth is seeking to become the only player apart from Woods in this modern age to win a major before his 22nd birthday. Professional golf has hardly toiled during the years since 1993, but few characters have been catapulted on to the scene with as much vim. The next logical step is a major triumph; to do so here, Spieth will need to handle arguably the most intense pressure in his sport. \u201cI wanted to get off to a good start. Sometimes that is the hardest part of this tournament,\u201d said the world No4. \u201cI managed to do that then a few things went my way. I\u2019m excited by the start. I played well here last year but never broke 70. Eight under par at Augusta National is nothing to complain about.\u201d For a back-nine spell on Thursday, Spieth was flirting with the unheard of. There has never been a 62 in a major championship. Spieth raced to eight under par through 14 holes; a consequence of some outrageous fortune on the last two of those holes, it must be recognised, alongside wonderful golf. Even on the 12th Spieth was certain he had missed a birdie putt to the right; it dropped to the bottom of the cup. Later, Augusta National applied brakes, albeit softly. Spieth was over-zealous with his second to the par five 15th, triggering his first bogey of the day. Suddenly, 97 other competitors were afforded some relief. Or perhaps 96 is a more valid, given Ben Crenshaw\u2019s 91 \u2013 more than four times Spieth\u2019s age \u2013 rather appears to rule him out of Sunday afternoon\u2019s business end. That was a five stroke improvement on the same round, 12 months ago, so perhaps chuckles are unfair. In another golfing stratosphere, Spieth holds a lead of three, secured with a glorious birdie putt from 15ft on the last but it was immediately offset by Jason Day on the 16th. The Australian thereby become the closest pursuer, a position earned by five back-nine birdies in a row, but dropped a shot on the penultimate hole to slip back into second place with Ernie Els, Justin Rose and Charley Hoffman. Spieth is the youngest ever to hit the front here after 18 holes. McIlroy is seven adrift and clearly still a notable factor but a batch of other players \u2013 Paul Casey, Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed and Dustin Johnson among them \u2013 also hover with menacing intent. In proving this will not just be the domain of the fresh-faced gentleman, Els had been level with Spieth for a spell. \u201cI felt at ease out there, I felt patient,\u201d said the enduring South African. The prominence of Rose will be a surprise to many given he arrived in Georgia with a record of three missed cuts in five starts. The Englishman cited his pairing with Bubba Watson, the defending champion, as a factor in his day\u2019s work. Watson signed for a 71. \u201cThere was a nice atmosphere out there on the golf course,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThat felt like it got the day off to a good start, playing with Bubba, and the excitement level out there. \u201cI guess there is just that little sort of feeling of the spotlight being on you and the pressure that brings. There was the crowd, the energy and atmosphere that you normally get later, towards the back-end of a golf tournament. I felt like I had that feeling early today. It was just a nice bit of energy or adrenaline to really kick start my game. \u201cI felt like I\u2019ve been practising really well the last two, three weeks and it was nice just to be able to take it into the arena today.\u201d Spieth has become a regular at hogging the limelight.
