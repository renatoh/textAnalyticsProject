The sum, towards the top of City estimates, is set to be announced within the next two weeks after nearly two months of intensive but fruitful negotiations between BAE and the MoD to renegotiate the contracts and 'bottom out' the financial implications of disastrous cost and time overruns. The contracts, together worth \u00a35 billion, were the subject of a furious row between the company and the Ministry before Christmas, when BAE was forced to make a stock exchange announcement before it could quantify its potential losses. City analysts criticised the company for announcing budget and time problems without costing them, calculated a range of between \u00a3300m and \u00a31bn, and marked the company's value down by around \u00a32bn. BAE suggested the MoD had used inappropriate tactics to force it into an announcement. But MoD and BAE sources now say rapid progress has been made in negotiations and that a resolution may be announced this week, but certainly before the company's preliminary results come out on 20 February. Sources close to the company said that the \u00a3800m would not be written off over a single year, and that there would be changes in requirements from the MoD. These could include reducing the number of Nimrod planes required from 18; altering its capabilities to include, for example, a bombing function; and altering the Astute requirement from three to two. One source close to the discussions said: 'Agreement on all of this is very close. The Nimrod contract is more likely to be capable of alteration than the submarines, and it could well involve having fewer planes.' A BAE source said: 'There will be changes to both of the contracts. The downside over their lifetimes will be around \u00a3800m. There may be compensation for the alteration of requirement requested by the MoD.' An MoD source added: 'There is no doubt we've made a lot of progress: we should know where we are soon. Things have been a lot more positive since Christmas.' Both projects were agreed on 'fixed price' contract terms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
