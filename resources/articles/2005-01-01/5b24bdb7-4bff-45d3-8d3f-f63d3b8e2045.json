Chief executive Ray Kelvin was \"delighted\" by the progress made in sales over the nine weeks to December 24 and believed there was plenty of future growth potential. \"The new shops are bedding down well but it's about all-round improvement in the product and this will continue,\" he said. The Las Vegas store - the sixth in America - opened in November while Regent Street only started trading last month. Future store openings include a large World of Ted outlet which will replace two smaller ones in Nottingham from the end of next week. Gross margins across the Ted Baker range were in line with last year over the two-month period and the company said it would enter the new season with a \"clean stock position\". The company never gives like-for-like figures, arguing that it is a new growth business and such figures would be meaningless. Shares in the company rose nearly 4% to 508.5p and some analysts tweaked their full-year profit figures upwards. Seymour Pierce raised its top-of-the-range annual profit forecast from \u00a316.25m to \u00a316.5m and said it was looking for a figure of around \u00a318.5m for the year after that. \"The management continue expertly to control the expansion of the Ted Baker brand keeping the product fresh, and maintaining consumer interest. We believe it has a long way to go both in the UK and overseas,\" said analyst Rhys Williams. Mr Kelvin has also attracted praise for being quick off the mark to donate more than 10,000 items of clothing to victims of the tsunami. \u00b7 Austin Reed, the upmarket clothing retailer, said yesterday that it expected its full-year results to exceed market forecasts following improved performances from both its brands. Group like-for-like retail sales increased by 0.2% in the 22 weeks to January 15. This was an improvement on a decline of 0.6 % in the first seven weeks of the company's second half and the fall of 4% in the first half to August 14."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
