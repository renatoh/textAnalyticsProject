The former treasurer and ambassador to the US told Sydney\u2019s 2GB radio on Thursday that there were \u201cplenty of good reason\u201d for Donald Trump and the Republican campaign team to challenge results \u2013 which are still being counted \u2013 through litigation. The Labor party leader, Anthony Albanese, rebuked Hockey, saying it \u201cdoesn\u2019t help to have Australians make comments that aren\u2019t thought through\u201d questioning the legitimacy of results. Hockey is one of a number of conservatives questioning Joe Biden\u2019s strong comeback in the vote count, including the Nationals MP George Christensen, who on Facebook has been slapped with a warning for misleading claims about \u201cdodgy votes\u201d boosting the former vice president. Hockey, Australia\u2019s ambassador from 2016 to January 2020, said the US electoral system was \u201ca complete dog\u2019s breakfast, right across, not just Pennsylvania, but right across the country\u201d. \u201cI mean there are 10,000 different organisations which are responsible for setting the rules for the US presidential election,\u201d he told 2GB. \u201cIn the US, you have every state, and every county and every city. And if there is a strong bias, one way or the other, they do everything they can to suppress the vote, or increase the vote. It\u2019s a mess.\u201d Asked if electoral fraud were possible in the US system, Hockey replied: \u201cOh for sure. The question is whether it is enough to change the election outcome and I doubt it is, but absolutely.\u201d Hockey attempted to support the unfounded claim by noting that in Washington DC \u201csome people got two ballot papers \u2026 and of course, last night, in Washington DC, 93% of the city voted for Joe Biden\u201d. He said the margin was \u201chard to believe\u201d because his best booth in the seat of North Sydney had delivered him 83% of the vote. In fact, Biden\u2019s win of 93% of the vote is consistent with results in the District of Columbia which strongly backed the Democratic candidate in the 2016 election by 91%, in 2012 (91%) and 2008 (92%). Albanese told reporters in Sydney that Biden\u2019s results were \u201cpretty consistent\u201d with previous outcomes, rebuking Hockey for saying there was \u201ca question mark over the legitimacy of the Washington DC vote\u201d. Christensen posted on Facebook early on Thursday morning that his prediction that Trump would win \u201cdidn\u2019t take Democrat vote fraud into account\u201d. Christensen posted graphs of what he termed \u201cunnatural jumps in tallies in Wisconsin and Michigan\u201d and falsely attributed them to \u201cdodgy extra votes at about 4 in the morning, just like the president [Donald Trump] said\u201d. Politifact has explained the spikes were caused by counties releasing results from large batches of votes \u2013 which favoured Biden but also included votes for Trump. Facebook warned users that Christensen\u2019s post was \u201cmissing context\u201d, adding a link to the Politifact fact-check concluding that the jumps in votes do not substantiate claims of fraud. Christensen has also cast doubt on democratic election results by asking \u201cwhat is going on in the US?\u201d and linking to Trump campaign materials explaining how \u201cthey\u2019re [Democrats are] trying to steal the election\u201d. The One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts also expressed scepticism by noting on Facebook that Trump had gone \u201cfrom having a strong lead in the battleground states \u2026 to his lead strangely disappearing putting Biden in the lead\u201d. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Roberts and the Nationals senator Matt Canavan found a silver lining in the fact that as of 4 November the US has officially quit the Paris climate agreement. Canavan said \u201cthe result of the US election might not be known for a while yet\u201d but he did not cast doubt on the vote count. In the 2020 campaign social media companies such as Twitter has been more active in labelling claims by Trump as misleading, including adding a warning to a tweet on election night falsely claiming that Democrats were trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
