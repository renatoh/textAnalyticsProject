I applaud them and you should, too. But, their experiment, however laudable, is unlikely to work. Each candidate has agreed to donate one half the amount to charity of any third-party advertising that either supports them or attacks their opponent by name. In other words, they want zero spending by so-called outside independent groups. If those groups do spend money in Massachusetts for or against the other candidate, then the candidates themselves will have to cough up funding for charities chosen by the other candidate. So far, so good \u2013 and congratulations to the candidates for trying to halt the outside funding gusher. However, hundreds of thousands of dollars are already flowing into the race. On the right, groups such as Crossroads GPS have been bashing Elizabeth Warren as both an extreme leftist aligned with the Occupy Wall Street movement and too cozy with the big banks. On the other side, the League of Conservation Voters, the union-funded Rethink Pac and the League of Women Voters have been casting Brown as anti-environment and pro-big oil. Both candidates say these advertisements are a distortion. Unfortunately, the candidates do not control this outside spending. The candidates would like the media to turn down such outside advertising. But the dirty secret every campaign year is that commercial broadcasters love \u2013 and, in fact, have come to depend upon \u2013 the money thrown at them in election years. So, despite the pledge by the candidates, advertising paid for by outside groups is still likely to blanket the airwaves. Still, it would be great if more candidates made the same agreement. The public would benefit from saner political contests based on issues, ideas and policies rather than innuendo and distortions. But I'm not holding my breath. Since the US supreme court's Citizens United decision in 2010, the American political process has effectively been hijacked by groups gearing up with unlimited dollars, often from undisclosed donors, to help defeat candidates of the wrong political persuasion, in their view. This may represent an odd interpretation of the first amendment, one that seems to serve wealthy special interests, but it is still the law of the land. Voluntary codes of conduct and mutual pledges are good news, but only changes in the law, including full and prompt disclosure of political spending, will change the political equation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
