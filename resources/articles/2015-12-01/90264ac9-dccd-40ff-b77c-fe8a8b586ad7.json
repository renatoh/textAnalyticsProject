Louisa Johnson has won X Factor 2015, which means this is probably the last X Factor liveblog I\u2019ll ever write. I might change my mind, or be coerced into returning next year, but right now this really feels like the end of something. I realise this means I\u2019ll miss Louisa\u2019s triumphant return to X Factor next year, which will be her first of three televised appearances before she disappears forever, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all survive. In which case, thanks again for all the support, everyone. You guys have been great. Now, please do the decent thing and turn your televisions off. Egg-kay! Have a very Blardigan Christmas, everyone! @StuHeritage Unfortunately Harry Styles didn\u2019t run onstage and tell Louisa about all the pussy she\u2019ll get now, but I\u2019m sure he wanted to. Rita Bloody Ora. Louis Walsh wouldn\u2019t have done this, you know. Oh look, Rita\u2019s run up onstage to hog the limelight be there for her actual new friend Louisa. Here she comes again, then. Louisa\u2019s back onstage to sing the first two thirds of her winners\u2019 single before she breaks down in tears and the other X Factor finalists run up and hug her. Things that are happening on the television right now: 1) Louisa is crying 2) Reggie N Bollie are being impressively magnanimous 3) Rita Ora is doing her best to make it all about her. Rita Ora has never made a good decision in her entire life. Oh god, I downloaded the X factor app for nothing. I feel so dirty. Yup, Louisa. The winner of X Factor 2015 is... Flack is legitimately hyperventilating at the moment. OK, let\u2019s crown Louisa and get on with our lives. It\u2019s time for the results. Oh, I just realised. I didn\u2019t even get sent any free Nutella this year. This whole bloody thing has been for absolutely nothing. Usually at this point I\u2019d get ready to time the climactic pause before the winner is announced. But I\u2019m not going to this year, because I\u2019m worried that Blardigan is going to wander off and bang his head on a tree if things go quiet for too long. But first, adverts, because god knows Moon Hitler needs more stuff. OK gang. Voting is now closed. My liveblogging future is sealed. HELLO ADELE HAVE YOU GOT AN ALBUM OUT ARE YOU ON TOUR WHAT\u2019S YOUR FAVOURITE FARTING ANIMAL? IS IT A HORSE? IT\u2019S A HORSE, ISN\u2019T IT? A FUNNY FARTING HORSE? NOW GET OUT. The song ends and Adele cackles and suddenly the world can forgive her for being a bit boring when she sings. This song is much longer than I expected. Just think how long the slowed-down John Lewis ballad version is going to be next year. We\u2019ll all be dead by the second chorus. Adele\u2019s still singing, by the way. I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ve heard this song the last six times I\u2019ve had to phone a customer services department. If anything, this is just gearing me up to shout at a call centre worker. Here\u2019s one. It\u2019s called Funny Horse Fart. I haven\u2019t watched it yet, but with a title like that it\u2019s bound to be a winner. Adele\u2019s singing Hello, which you\u2019ve all heard a billion times by now. I\u2019ll see if I can find another animal fart video, shall I? Of course, this means that we\u2019re three minutes away from hearing Blardigan ask Adele if she\u2019s got a new album out. I dunno, has she? We\u2019re back. And now, in keeping with tonight\u2019s prominent theme, Adele\u2019s here to sing something by Motorhead. Is there any way I can download an app and vote for the funny animal fart video to win X Factor instead? Just think: if you all vote for Reggie N Bollie, then five years from now Simon Cowell will have to introduce a weepy retrospective package full of emotional Reggie N Bollie tributes from James Corden and Robbie Williams. Or, you know, he would if X Factor was still going to be a thing five years from now. But it won\u2019t be, because Jesus Christ this is dreadful. \u2018After the break, someone\u2019s life will change forever\u2019 says Blardigan. He\u2019s right. Mine will change forever. I\u2019ll get my weekends back. Oh no, don\u2019t recap the winners\u2019 single performances. They both sound like a bag of cats being dropped into an active minefield, but in different ways. Yeurgh. Oh, look, a recap. Quick, Recap Iguana, sum up my mood as best you can: Nicely done, Recap Iguana. Nicely done. Still half an hour of X Factor left, but I\u2019m toying with the idea of giving up now. Reggie N Bollie have been strung up by their nads and it isn\u2019t pretty in the slightest. I\u2019d vote for them again if I could. Still, everyone loves a farting animal, don\u2019t they? That\u2019s the main thing I\u2019m taking from tonight. I\u2019m never liveblogging X Factor again and animals are funny when they fart. Oh, this is interesting... The liveblog system just crashed. Sorry about that. I think it died of boredom. This is exactly what you think it sounds like, and it\u2019s boring, and it\u2019s a stitch-up and I\u2019m going to ignore it in favour of this compilation video of farting animals instead. Farting animals! Yeah yeah, whatever. This is exactly what you\u2019d expect it to sound like. Anyway, now for Louisa. Is it going to be the same tinpot reggae version, or are they chucking the whole Hallelujah at her? I bet it\u2019s Hallelujah, isn\u2019t it? STITCH-UP. I mean, that\u2019s a total stitch-up, isn\u2019t it? Maybe this the theme of the night, giving acts hugely unsuitable songs to sing, and Louisa will have to release some sort of Zumba megamix as her winners\u2019 single. Right? That\u2019s a thing that could happen, isn\u2019t it? They must win. Please vote for Reggie N Bollie, everyone. One person in the audience is clapping. The rest are reacting in the same way that people do when a kid wanders into a party, pulls down their trousers and craps on the carpet. Nobody cheers. They\u2019re hitting, at maximum, 20% of the notes. It\u2019s a mess. It\u2019s a nightmare. It\u2019s terrible. REGGIE N BOLLIE MUST WIN X FACTOR. No, it\u2019s not weird. It\u2019s awful. The backing track is literally the Reggae preset of a Casio keyboard. This is a car crash of a performance, and it\u2019s hard to see it as anything as a stitch-up job to make Louisa win. Holy twatting christ, they literally are doing Forever Young. And they\u2019re apparently doing it straight. This is weird. But before that, Reggie N Bollie apparently have to recap their entire lives. Wait, who\u2019s that knocking on the door? Hey, if it isn\u2019t our good buddy RECAP IGUANA! Hey Recap Iguana, how\u2019s tricks? Oh here we go. Winners\u2019 single time. Reggie N Bollie first. Don\u2019t let me down, Reggie N Bollie. You. Must. Not. Let. Me. Down. Ah. Someone is describing the bad old novelty acts to Will Ferrell, and he\u2019s exaggerating how good they are. Only not quite as good as I made that sound. Wait, what\u2019s this? Will Ferrell is doing an X Factor retrospective? OK, X Factor, I\u2019m interested. JESUS! They\u2019re sending him a camera too! Right, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m quitting this liveblog to die of loneliness miles away from everyone I love. Look at all the swag you get given! Wowee! WAIT! MOON HITLER UPDATE! They\u2019ve sent him a PS4 as well now. You know, I\u2019m starting to think that being an elderly man dying of loneliness might actually be quite a sweet gig. Ooh, Moon Hitler! The song ends and Blardigan comes on for the post-song interview. But One Direction are splitting up, so he can\u2019t ask if they\u2019ve got an album coming out or a tour soon. Instead he begs them to drink beer with him. It is heartbreaking. They\u2019re doing another song that I don\u2019t know because I\u2019m not a soggy-knickered 14-year-old girl. But it seems to be their Never Forget. Old photos are flashing up behind them, back from the days when they were a) still slightly enthusiastic about singing and b) knew how to wash. It\u2019s quite nostalgic, and it\u2019s reminded me that I think I quite fancied Harry\u2019s mum once. That\u2019s my sole takeaway from this emotional farewell performance - I think I fancied one of their mums once. Well done me. One Direction are singing another song in a minute, but first Simon Cowell is This Is Your Life-ing them. He\u2019s saying how much he\u2019ll miss them, as is Wayne Rooney, James Corden, Danny DeVito, Jack Whitehall, Little Mix, David Beckham and Robbie Williams. It\u2019s a touching send-off, and it makes me sad about the fact that they\u2019re all going to immediately be taken off and boiled for glue as soon as they stop singing now. Oh, that song got really big before it ended. I think it was called Infinity, by the way, named ironically for the shelf-life of a reality television boyband. This is not a very good One Direction song. It sounds like they\u2019re trying to be mature, and they\u2019re not mature. One of them is literally wearing your nan\u2019s wallpaper as a suit. And his hair looks like he ran through a local market\u2019s nylon extension stall blind drunk, too. I\u2019ll miss him. The boys are all here. The one who\u2019ll end up as an X Factor judge (the blonde one), the one who started off as Gary Barlow and then turned into an uncommunicative second division footballer begrudgingly participating in a post-match interview (Liam?), the one wearing your nan\u2019s wallpaper as a suit (Harry) and the other one (the other one). We are back, and it\u2019s time for One Direction. They\u2019re here to show Louisa and Reggie N Bollie all the wonderful things that come with X Factor success. Those things in order: terrible haircuts, prison tattoos, the dead-eyed demeanour of a circus chimp. Go X Factor! Incidentally, voting for the same act five times for free on the X Factor app \u2013 as I did earlier - is a weirdly depressing thing to do. The app keeps asking \u2018Are you sure you want to do this?\u2019 and you subsequently have to ask yourself all kinds of important life questions. I\u2019m not sure I want to do this, app. I\u2019m not sure I want to do this at all. I\u2019ll miss Blardigan. Blardigan is backstage interviewing Louisa\u2019s family now. Well, I say \u2018interviewing\u2019. What he\u2019s actually doing is just saying \u2018Are you proud?\u2019 and \u2018Mayzin\u2019 over and over again, like an unsold talking Blardigan doll that\u2019s been struck by lightning and now wants to take its vicious revenge on the world. Clearly Simon Cowell is exaggerating as wildly as he can to improve Louisa\u2019s chances of winning. I hope he fails, because even Louisa just said something along the lines of \u2018I\u2019m only 17\u2019, which is possibly the most annoying thing I\u2019ve ever heard. Simon Cowell calls the performance \u2018the best thing I have ever heard\u2019. Excuse ME, Simon Cowell, but remember the Conway Sisters? Remember them? For shame. Oh, this is embarrassing. In a desperate bid to stretch out the applause to Reggie N Bollie lengths, Rita Ora stands up and wobbles around for the audience. It doesn\u2019t really work. Oh, the song\u2019s over. It was OK. I guess. Someone pointed out to me this week that this song is just a list of all the brilliant things that men have invented, which makes it a bit annoying. But still, who\u2019s to say that a man didn\u2019t invent the electric light specifically so that a 17-year-old girl could yell about it to Simon Cowell one day? Louisa\u2019s doing It\u2019s A Man\u2019s Man\u2019s Man\u2019s World again, and she\u2019s given such a preposterous introduction that it\u2019ll be a genuine letdown if the song doesn\u2019t climax with litres of blood squirting out of her ears. We\u2019re back! And now it\u2019s time for Louisa Johnson, who is the favourite to win because she\u2019s such a blank void that viewers get to project their own desires onto her. For instance, I\u2019m imagining her as someone who never has to liveblog X Factor again, but that\u2019s just me. In the VT, Louisa watches an old performance and... HANG ON, is Louisa Johnson liveblogging her own performance? Guys, I think we know who\u2019s going to take over from me now. That\u2019s good news, isn\u2019t it? Adverts now. Apparently Michael Buble has a Christmas album out. Michael Buble hasn\u2019t been on X Factor this year, has he? Good. Blardigan\u2019s backstage with Reggie N Bollie\u2019s family. Sadly, he refrains from my new favourite of his interviewing tricks, the Suddenly Profound Question That He Expects To Be Answered Within The Space of a Soundbite. So I\u2019ll do it instead: Reggie\u2019s youngest son: to what extent do you think that a man\u2019s worth should be judged by his ability to cope with loss? You have four seconds. Based on crowd reaction alone, I don\u2019t see how Louisa can top that. I mean, how hard CAN you clap for a knackered power ballad performed by a void? Ooh, Simon Cowell just said that Reggie N Bollie could win X Factor. He\u2019s hedging his bets. Is this... is this actual tension? This is new. The crowd is going wild. Simon Cowell \u2013 who actually, now I come to think of it, looks a bit like Tom Cruise in Collateral tonight \u2013 isn\u2019t allowed to speak. This is probably for the best. Oh good crikey. Now they\u2019re doing I Like to Move It Move It. They\u2019re surrounded by dancers. There are lasers everywhere. This is a level of energy that simply doesn\u2019t deserve to belong on an X Factor final. It\u2019s astonishing. Reggie N Bollie must really want me to carry on liveblogging this. Reggie N Bollie are doing their song of the series, which quite rightly You Don\u2019t Know You\u2019re Beautiful. It\u2019s certainly going down a storm - I think I just saw Simon Cowell doing a simultaneous neck-dance and overbite. That is HIGH PRAISE INDEED. Reggie N Bollie\u2019s first song of the evening now. Can they win X Factor? That depends on the answer to the question \u2018How many times is the British public willing to listen to two men repeat their own names over an identical backing track?\u2019 If the answer is \u2018Slightly more than they already have\u2019, then I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ve got this in the bag. In the VT, Reggie N Bollie watch an old performance of theirs and clap their hands. I think this technically counts as a recap, but Recap Iguana is drinking milk to ease his gullet. Maybe next time. Time for the post-song interview. HELLO COLDPLAY ARE YOU ON TOUR WHEN\u2019S YOUR ALBUM OUT WHO\u2019S YOUR FAVOURITE NOW GO AWAY ADELE\u2019S ON IN A MINUTE AND SHE\u2019S BETTER. Four men in unconvincing monkey suits have now joined Coldplay onstage for some synchronised dancing. Remember the year when Coldplay led 10,000 people in a dazzling light show that pushed HD television to brave new heights? Now they\u2019ve just got three rolls of toilet paper and 4th Impact in monkey suits. The music industry isn\u2019t what it was, is it? Here they are, singing their new song that sounds like it was specifically recorded to provide 75% of ITV2 shows with a soundtrack. It\u2019s quite the new look for Coldplay. Especially for Chris Martin, whose new thing is staggering around on the stage as if he\u2019s been shot in the kneecap. Now for tonight\u2019s big Coldplay performance, which seems to happen with such deadening regularity during X Factor finals that I fear they might be attempting to become the new Take That Singing The Flood On X Factor 400 Times In A Row. Guys, you\u2019re going to fail. Nobody is the new Take That Singing The Flood On X Factor 400 Times In A Row. Remember Take That Singing The Flood On X Factor 400 Times In A Row? Happier times. While the ads are on, here\u2019s an updated Cheryl Fernandez Versini lookbook, courtesy of Twitter Some words of advice for the finalists from Mariah Carey now. Although they\u2019re less \u2018words of advice\u2019 and more \u2018apparently the results of a meaningless platitude generator gone horrifyingly haywire\u2019. I\u2019ve read inspirational Instagram quotes that have had more valuable content than that. 2/10 for Mariah Carey. Che\u2019s back! And that woman who sang like her mouth was full of pasta is clinging the hell onto him, because she knows that she\u2019s guaranteed a bit more screentime if she does. It\u2019s a cynical tactic, but I can\u2019t remember what her name is so who\u2019s the real winner? Seann Miley Moore\u2019s being given a lot of time here, though. He pretty much got his own entire verse then. Admittedly he filled it with an absolute maximum of two vowels, but it\u2019s the thought that counts. I literally cannot remember who the majority of the other acts are, though. And I do this for a living. I mean for crying out loud. Oh dear lord. Here\u2019s a group performance from all the X Factor finalists. They\u2019re singing Downtown. 4th Impact are here, being good. Now, would you like to hear what happened last night, or would you prefer to watch a lizard vomit up a deer? I\u2019m being rhetorical - HERE\u2019S RECAP IGUANA Blardigan just said \u2018Egg-kay\u2019 AND forgot to talk into his microphone. This is like a once-around-the-block greatest hits package for him. I\u2019m going to miss Blardigan. I hope he comes to my house after this and just bollockses everything up over and over again for my entertainment. Time, for the very last time, to meet the judges. NICK! Dressed as Louis Walsh JOHN TRAVOLTA! Dressed as the bellydancer who accidentally turned up to your granddad\u2019s funeral. CHERYL! Literally a feather duster. SIMON! I am living purely for the one solitary inch of hairless flesh that separates his beard and his chest hair. Here they are, Flack and Blardigan. Tonight, their shtick is... HOLDING HANDS, MIMING A SONG AND NOTHING ELSE. This is the sort of blazing charisma that\u2019ll serve them well in their upcoming careers as the caretakers of an abandoned fairground in the middle of nowhere. Well this certainly counts as a recap, so let\u2019s say hello to our new favourite recurring Guardian character. It\u2019s RECAP IGUANA!!! IT\u2019S TIME! TO DEFACE! THE MUSIC! God, I really do want Reggie N Bollie to win tonight. In fact, you know what? Here\u2019s an ultimatum: I was sort of planning to make this my last-ever X Factor liveblog*, because barely anyone watches X Factor any more, and barely anyone reads the liveblog, and you don\u2019t have to be a genius to see that my heart hasn\u2019t really been in this. HOWEVER, if Reggie N Bollie X Factor tonight, I will be much MUCH more likely to come back and liveblog next year\u2019s show. But only if they win. Please, you must make them win. *I did say that last year too, but The Guardian made me liveblog this year\u2019s series. I am essentially powerless. But still, Reggie N Bollie to win please. Oh, and while I\u2019m embedding tweets, get a load of this. Guys, Kitty Brucknell from 2011 is reading this. Shut the front door. By the way, I really did vote for Reggie N Bollie earlier. Look, have some proof. In case I forget later, I think I should take a moment to say thanks to the few of you who actually stuck around this year. Watching X Factor has been an absolute chore for everybody this time around, and I genuinely expected to be writing this for an audience of zero. The fact that even a few of you clung on means an awful lot. Where we go from here is anyone\u2019s guess, but I appreciate your loyalty nonetheless. I watched last night\u2019s show, by the way (on catch-up, fast-forwarding through the adverts and recaps \u2013 why doesn\u2019t everybody watch it like that?) and truth be told I wish I\u2019d liveblogged it, purely because I think the skit about Louis Walsh being Moon Hitler was a deliberate attempt on the part of the show to appease me. But also, I have some thoughts: THE BEST BIT: The recap where they played Louisa Johnson\u2019s voice over all the other acts, then cut to Simon Cowell looking all ashen-faced because he knew it\u2019d make everyone claim that the show is a fix again. Also: the Cameltoe Choir who popped up behind Leona Lewis and Ben Haenow last night. Also: the return of Simon Cowell\u2019s nearly-beard, currently at the \u2018paying for a single can of Special Brew with 2p pieces at 9am in a newsagents\u2019 stage. Also: Rita Ora\u2019s hair, which was so clearly a wig that I\u2019m going to call her John Travolta for the rest of the series. THE WORST BIT: Rod Stewart. Rod Bloody Stewart, making the same noise that a waterlogged corpse makes if you poke it with a stick, but worse because waterlogged corpses tend not to heavily allude to sexual intercourse in front of young audiences. Also: the fact that the entire show didn\u2019t just consist of Fleur East and Little Mix singing songs together. Also: the duet between Louisa and John Travolta, which essentially sounded like an episode of Jeremy Kyle as directed by Tom Hooper. Hello literally just my Auntie Helen at this point, and welcome to the X Factor liveblog: the actual actual final. It\u2019s Stuart Heritage at the reigns again. Many thanks to Hannah for doing such a sterling job last night, but now I\u2019m back to ride this thing into the dirt once and for all. In just over two hours, we\u2019ll have discovered the winner of X Factor 2015. It\u2019ll either be Louisa Johnson or Reggie N Bollie, and if it isn\u2019t Reggie N Bollie then I\u2019m going to have a fit. I\u2019m still pretty sure that the winners\u2019 single will be Forever Young by Bob Dylan, you see, and I really want to hear Reggie N Bollie maul it to death, and I really want that noise to become the Christmas number one. And that means I\u2019ve actually voted tonight. For the first time ever. I didn\u2019t even vote for Wagner, and I properly bloody love Wagner. We\u2019re in a for a packed night. As well as picking a winner, there\u2019ll be guest performances from Coldplay, Adele and One Direction. And, since this is the final, it only seems sensible that Recap Iguana will get to stretch his legs a little bit too. Thankfully, however, there will be no Rod Stewart tonight. For this alone we should all be extraordinarily grateful. The show starts at 8pm. We\u2019ve got this far, so let\u2019s all take a deep breath and push through it together. We can do this, egg-kay? We can do this. Phonehand, phonehand, vote Reggie N Bollie. May they win and break the Christmas number one. Join Stuart Heritage, Coldplay, Adele and One Direction right here for the X Factor Final tomorrow night at 8pm. Thank you for your comments. But most of all, thank you, Craig David, for the music and all-round lifestyle motivation. Goodnight! Che and Grimmy are, in the words of Craig David, Walking Away. I was going to write that as a Blardigan-style blunder. \u201cHeh heh, as if Reggie N Bollie are through to the final\u201d. But, by the power of Craig David, it has actually happened. Your X Factor finalists are Louisa and Reggie N Bollie. SHUT UP, IT\u2019S REGGIE N BOLLIE! CRAIG DAVID IS THROUGH. Oops, that should read: \u201cLouisa\u201d. Phonehand all you like, but those lines are closed and it\u2019s time to see who doesn\u2019t come back to watch Coldplay tomorrow. If Reggie N Bollie go now, it\u2019s a travesty. Things tonight is missing: 1 Seann Miley Moore 2 More Craig David 3 Anyone that would get their songs played on Grimmy\u2019s show 4 The Buble 5 In fact, does anyone remember that time Same Difference did All I Want For Christmas? Apart from that, there\u2019s not long to go and it\u2019s been a blast, hasn\u2019t it? Oh please turn this into a Maggie May mash-up. Imagine if Rod and Craig did a duet right now. OK, there are a few people finding this liveblog hard to follow. Here\u2019s a recap: Moon Louis Walsh, some songs, Craig David all over your boink, Little Sax, more Rod to come. Everybody clear now? Good. Recap o\u2019clock. And for anyone finding this liveblog a little hard to follow, all you need is Craig David\u2019s Greatest Hits and another drink. Blardigan\u2019s right: it\u2019s a modern-day supergroup. This has a touch of the Lady Marmalade, but it just goes to show how good X Factor runners-up can be. Maybe Reggie N Bollie are the Fleur East of 2015. Fleur and Little Mix, plus a plinth: that\u2019s Black Magic. Swap the songs over, but Craig David still wins. Credit to Flackers for holding it together though. Vote for Louisa or she\u2019ll be walking awaaaay. These girls can sing. All over your boink. Louisa is embracing Jennifer Hudson night, but does she have Craig David? No, she has Rita Ora. Yeah, whatever, Louisa. Unless you\u2019re about to do What\u2019s Your Flava? it\u2019s all over. Craig David would be in my friendship bucket. Blardigan wants a re-re-wind. Who doesn\u2019t? In fact, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do in the adverts. The moment Craig David took to the stage, though. \u201cYou know, you know Reggie N Bollie do it like that\u201d. Still, he\u2019s got tomorrow to chill. There\u2019s not enough Craig David on X Factor. Probably because he\u2019s usually making love on a Saturday. Eat clean and train dirty! It\u2019s only Craig David! The X Factor moment of the century. Where\u2019s Kes? Reggie N Bollie now. Bring on the Coldplay duet. Oh no, they\u2019ve got Fuse ODG. Your love is like hey-laaaaa. This is total RNB. Rod! Rod! Rod! Look at him, resplendent with his peacock hair. So he may not have had a decent hit since 1978\u2019s Do Ya Think I\u2019m Sexy? but it\u2019s Rod. You hear me? You can\u2019t hear Che, but who cares? It\u2019s this year\u2019s Alexandra/Beyonc\u00e9 moment. Che\u2019s doing The First Cut Is The Deepest and some ladies are waving at him. Where\u2019s Rod? \u201cIt\u2019s the 19-year-old lad from Essex with the incredible voice.\u201d Blardigan is wistfully thinking of his younger self rather than Che. That song has taken the mood down a bit, hasn\u2019t it? Hopefully they\u2019ll bring out Gamu and Ablisa next. \u201cGuys\u201d. That says it all, really. They should have got Leona doing One More Sleep. It\u2019s Chico time! Uh-oh, I smell Snow Patrol. This is what you have to look forward to, Louisa! \u201cOne has had an amazing year, the other is Ben Haenow.\u201d Oh yes, it\u2019s the first guest performance. It\u2019s that time of the night when I get to delve below the line and guffaw at your comments and plinth love. Keep \u2019em coming! I\u2019m also muting the telly because my neighbours are having a 60th birthday and their playlist is H.O.T. Now playing: Alicia Bridges\u2019 I Love The Nightlife. There\u2019s a disappointing lack of phonehand tonight. Maybe Louisa just brushed her hair away because she felt one coming on. Cowell: \u201cYou. Can. Sing.\u201d Grimmy: \u201cYou can sing\u201d. Ora: Some veiled threat about what\u2019s coming up later. And again! Anyone got \u201c17 years old\u201d in their drinking game? This version\u2019s alright and they\u2019ve booked actual Heaven for the backdrop, so Louisa\u2019s still the favourite. Yesss! Louisa is busting out R Kelly\u2019s I Believe I Can Fly. Which gives me the chance to bust out my favourite pop fact: R Kelly has a fear of flying, so spends hours on his tour bus rather than getting on a plane. It\u2019s no Ignition though, is it? Toot-toooot. Only a duet with Wagner can lose it for Louisa now. Ora\u2019s over-the-knee boots would not pass an Ofsted inspection though. Right, it\u2019s the adverts so time to get another drink and fantasise about how amazing Diva Fever would have been if they\u2019d have made it to The X Factor Final. Grimmy\u2019s verdict: \u201cWow\u201d. He loves their contagious energy. \u201cI might be the most hated person right now,\u201d says Ora. OK. \u201cA strawberry and liver milkshake,\u201d says Cowell. \u201cYou\u2019re shouting a little bit.\u201d Who isn\u2019t? \u201cGuys\u201d klaxon! Drink! Ooh, they\u2019ve tickled Cowell. Truly, these two put the R and indeed B in R n B. They\u2019re singing a bit like they\u2019ve never heard the song before, but at least there\u2019s a Human Centipede. Sorry, conga. Reggie N Bollie may not have massive baps, but they\u2019re here to Spice Up Your Life. Aaaaaah... Every time Cheryl does an impromptu dance, another person pines for that time she nicknamed herself \u201cPush Ten\u201d on The Passions of Girls Aloud. This is just lots of people going: \u201cMash it up\u201d, isn\u2019t it? How is Che the underdog? He\u2019s the one who can sing. In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, Louisa is going to win. Don\u2019t bet on it, though. I put 50 quid on Fleur last year and then she got stiffed with a Labrinth duet. \u201cPerfect,\u201d says Grimmy. \u201cCongrats\u201d Faintest praise ever from Ora there. At least Cheryl says it\u2019s \u201cGod-given\u201d. Will he get in that giant burger and get eaten by Cowell later? Che has his own diner. He\u2019s singing Amy Winehouse\u2019s Valerie. Actually, The Zutons\u2019 Valerie. But he\u2019s not making that song his own. Grimmy\u2019s really nice, isn\u2019t he? In other news, that tour bus with Che\u2019s name on isn\u2019t a patch on the Backstreet Boys\u2019 plane. If anyone has Che crying in your drinking game as well as \u201cjourney\u201d, please down in one now. YOU\u2019RE a massive X Factor bus. Thoughts so far, you lot below the line? I don\u2019t know if I said yes to one too many mulled wines at a kids\u2019 birthday party earlier, but this reminds me of the Smash Hits Poll Winners\u2019 Party. Oh now Stevie\u2019s singing a Christmas song in the ads. I\u2019m getting all sentimental. Apologies to any millennials - that was a Kriss Kross reference. Reggie N Bollie alert! If you\u2019re not swapping rearranging your clothes so they\u2019re back to front, viewers, you have no soul. First up: Che. He may not have his shirt tucked in, but he can feel it coming in the air tonight. Oh, here\u2019s Louisa. Medley klaxon! Pray that Xtina and the rabbit from the Diirty video storm the stage. I don\u2019t want to come over all Black Eyed Peas, but I suspect tonight\u2019s going to be a good night. Heritage is going to be gutted he\u2019s missing this. \u201cYou remind me of a young Moon Hitler...\u201d Tonight, X Factor is live from actual Wembley. Not just that studio round the corner with all the crisps. Blardigan and Flackers are ready. Cheryl emerges in full Girls Aloud\u2019s The Promise gownage, Grimmy is working it, no-one is ready for Rita Ora\u2019s jelly and Cowell\u2019s hot like fiy-ah. Actually, this is quite good. That looks like a young Louis Walsh. Wait, what? Hello everyone, order your takeaway and charge your glasses: it\u2019s the biggest TV night of the year. Oh yes, The X Factor Final! International superstars are jetting in to duet with the finest talent and a new superstar will be launched\u2026 Hang on, it\u2019s not 2009 any more, is it? Back in the real world, it\u2019s Louisa vs Che vs Reggie N Bollie. Thanks for being here after such a \u201cvintage\u201d year. You\u2019ve got a stand-in liveblogger tonight, but curtail your complaints because the infinitely more hilarious Stuart Heritage returns for the big finale tomorrow. Until then, I\u2019m borrowing his catchphrases. It really doesn\u2019t get any better than this, does it? OK, let the Saturday night fun begin (once you\u2019ve all switched over from Strictly). Good evening, X Factorists. Brace yourself: it\u2019s just one hour to go until showtime. Please try and contain your excitement as there\u2019ll be enough of that once this (drumroll ahoy!) X Factor Final 2015 Liveblog gets started. Join me here at 8pm and in the meantime, here\u2019s Stuart Heritage on the finalists and their chances of winning\u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
