His compatriots are now unbeaten by England in 11 meetings that followed a defeat for them at Wembley 36 years ago. Another trend continued with the latest of Eriksson's poor results in friendlies. He will pay it no more heed than other defeats, but the coach might regret that there was no emphatic demonstration of his team's calibre or his influence upon it. Those who cannot forgive him for entertaining the offer of the Chelsea manager's job have something else to grumble about today. Fortunately for Eriksson the general boredom of the proceedings will make it impossible for the average person to whip up the energy to be aggrieved. England were in command of the first half but Sweden regrouped to dominate. Kim Kallstrom and Christian Wilhelmsson could have extended a lead established by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, before, in stoppage-time, Joe Cole slashed a chance to equalise over the bar. If Eriksson has to justify this fixture, he will point to the effervescent display by Jermain Defoe. As an early substitute for the injured Darius Vassell he was quick, sharp, sure of touch and always capable of stepping a vital yard away from defenders. Alan Thompson and Anthony Gardner also made their England debuts but could not impress as the Spurs attacker did. In practice, none the less, Defoe's prospects of boarding the plane for Euro 2004 will depend on the misfortunes of others. Unless Michael Owen, for example, is afflicted by injury Defoe will have to fix his mind on the World Cup in two years' time. Thoughts tended to meander from events in this game, where the only real glitter came from the tinsel strewn on the pitch by the razzmatazz before kick-off. Games of this sort are a cultivated taste and considering the lack of decibels from them before Ibrahimovic's goal the Swedish fans do not have the required palate. A friendly appeals almost exclusively to coaches. With the versatile Phil Neville used at right-back while his brother Gary was excused duty, Eriksson, for example, may have been deciding if he can do without Danny Mills as he seeks to slim down his squad for Euro 2004. The manager also witnessed a few individuals confirm their worth. Owen Hargreaves displayed vigour and skill on the right. As if inviting comparison with the injured David Beckham, he demonstrated craft at a set piece by bending a 30-yard shot against the angle of bar and post in the 26th minute. An even younger player was just as immune to the fatigue of a long season; the teenager Wayne Rooney was full of energy and ideas. When Defoe miscued a pass from the new captain Steven Gerrard, the Everton forward thrust out a leg and saw the ball ricochet off the post. Hargreaves again advertised his presence in the 35th minute, cutting in from the right and forcing Andreas Isaksson to parry his left-foot attempt. That sort of initiative will have been appreciated by Eriksson, but of the men trying for inclusion only Defoe added to his status. Thompson did make the starting line-up. He is 30, so it was perhaps thought it would be unkind to make him wait another minute longer than necessary. Despite the honour of being capped he must have nursed reservation. There might have been some difficulty in feeling special when there were no fewer than 14 players on the England bench. Come next season only six substitutes can be brought on in a friendly but Eriksson seemed bent on one last show of defiance towards the Fifa president Sepp Blatter. It is only a few weeks since Thompson commented on his chances of being taken to Euro 2004 by remarking that he had already started thumbing through the summer holiday brochures. He might have tidied them away but they will not have been dropped in the bin just yet. Without a target man to seek, the influence of his crossing is negated. Two minutes from the interval, though, he did challenge for a Gerrard cross so that the ball popped into the path of Rooney, whose effort bounced back off the goalkeeper's legs. The most interesting first-half incident for Sweden came when Jonathan Woodgate's hand touched a bouncing ball in the area after half an hour. The Newcastle United centre-half may have been nudged minimally by Johan Elmander but, fit at last to come back to Eriksson's team, he will have been relieved no penalty was given. Vassell must have been far more rueful. Too quick for Olof Mellberg, he was brought down by his Aston Villa team-mate and could not run off the knock. The Swedes eventually brought a legitimate edge to their play and moved in front after 54 minutes. After a weak header from Gardner, their substitute Kallstrom swerved a probing cross from the left and the Ajax forward Ibrahimovic got in front of Jamie Carragher to flick out a foot and glance the ball past David James. The advantage was not really deserved and the eager Defoe had called on Isaksson's replacement Magnus Kihlstedt to tip a 20-yarder over the bar after 51 minutes before he shot high from an acute angle at the corner-kick that followed. In a becalmed match, all the same, England could not whip up a storm once Sweden had moved in front.
