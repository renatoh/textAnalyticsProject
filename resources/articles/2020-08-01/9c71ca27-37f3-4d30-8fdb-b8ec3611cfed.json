Calgary Zoo said in May that it planned to return Er Shun and Da Mao to China, after coronavirus disrupted bamboo supply lines, but on Tuesday the zoo announced that due to the pandemic, it was still unable to secure travel permits. Giant pandas consume 40kg of fresh bamboo daily and the plant comprises 99% of their diet \u2013 raising concerns about keeping the animals fed. \u201cOur No 1 concern is access to fresh bamboo on a daily basis,\u201d said Greg Royer, chief operating officer of the Calgary Zoo. \u201cWe can\u2019t live with no guarantee \u2026 You can\u2019t say: we may be able to feed the pandas.\u201d The zoo is currently sourcing bamboo from the neighbouring province of British Columbia, but that source will stop being available in September. Complicating matters further, the Chinese government has not facilitated the paperwork for relocating the pandas due to tightening import rules imposed during the pandemic and a lack of quarantine space, according to the zoo. \u201cWe believe the best and safest place for Er Shun and Da Mao is where bamboo is abundant and easy to access,\u201d said the zoo\u2019s president and CEO, Cl\u00e9ment Lanthier, in a statement. \u201cThe continued delays in international permitting are putting the health and welfare of these two beautiful giant pandas in jeopardy.\u201d The pandas arrived in the western Canadian city of Calgary in March 2018 from a zoo in Toronto as part of a 10-year agreement between Canada and China, which was to run through 2023. Before the pandemic, the zoo sourced bamboo in China and was able to have it delivered \u201cwithin 48 to 60 hours\u201d of being harvested, said Royer. \u201cWe never fed the pandas [bamboo] that was more than six or seven days old. That\u2019s the kind of fresh they need.\u201d If the pandas are unable to be relocated to China, \u201cit gets much more difficult and unpredictable,\u201d Royer said. A zoo employee will be assigned to work full-time \u201cmaking sure that we have bamboo coming in\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
