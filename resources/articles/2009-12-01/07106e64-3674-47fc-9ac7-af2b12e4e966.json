Yet those who've stood by the erstwhile Dante Smith through his erratic rap career have had the last laugh. While so many of his peers are content to build their own brand, Mos Def is out on the music's front line, reminding us of its potential transformative power. This year's comeback, The Ecstatic, is his best album to date, and it was that record's combustible mixture of outspoken racial politics, musical fundamentalism and a deep and abiding love of hip-hop's rulebook-trashing freedom that fuelled his performance. Backed by a brace of DJs, and occasionally playing a drum kit, Mos Def was wilful and obtuse, but charismatic, engaging, and often quite brilliant. There were passages of the 90-minute set where he ambled aimlessly, songs collapsing in mumbled a cappella couplets. He sang most of Michael Jackson's Billie Jean and even had the Forum audience bellowing the chorus of Simply Red's Holding Back the Years (then desperately trying to pretend they were doing so ironically). At his best, Mos Def fuses metaphysics with politics in stanzas that put him alongside the finest hip-hop lyricists. In the superb Auditorium, he writes about how poets can harness the collective subconscious to effect change in times of war \u2013 \"Shoulders the lion's roar, voice is the siren/ I swing round, ring out, and bring down the tyrant.\" Lines like those, and the opening lyrics of his 10-year-old song, Hip Hop \u2013 \"Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape\" \u2013 sounded thrilling and vital and, despite his laid-back-cum-lackadaisical presentation, were filled with real importance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
