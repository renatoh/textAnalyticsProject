Catch up with the episode three and four blog. I had every intention of opening this blogpost with a discussion of how Pierre Cl\u00e9ment had been outrageously sidelined by the producers of Spiral this series, only for him to become the focus of this week\u2019s most shocking storyline. Pierre is dead (or at least we are certainly meant to infer so). As Jos\u00e9phine sits crumpled in a weeping Laure\u2019s arms in the entrance to A&amp;E, her handsome partner is lifeless in the emergency room thanks to a bullet to the stomach. Wasn\u2019t Cicero assassinated? As ever with Spiral, there is nothing straightforward about Pierre\u2019s shooting, even if the event itself was clear enough. Instead the responsibility is shared between a suspect on the edge of mental collapse; a judge determined to send a suicidal man back to prison, regardless of the doubts of others as to his guilt or fitness; and a prison guard who entirely misjudged the situation before him. But when it comes to apportioning blame, it is surely Roban who is most at fault here. Viewers new to the show might wonder why they should care at all about the judge: entirely self-obsessed this season, he has grown harsh and narrow-minded, determined to be proved right regardless of the consequences. He wasn\u2019t always this way \u2013 although he\u2019s been entirely less than likable before \u2013 but his actions in this case could well have pushed an innocent man into a most desperate situation. First Stephane Jaulin tried to take his own life; then, forced back to prison and separated from his son, his actions resulted in Pierre losing his. Poor Jos\u00e9phine, who will for ever have to live with the jealousy that drove her away from her lover\u2019s arms on what appears to have been his final night. Part of what I had intended to write, before the final episode\u2019s dramatic conclusion, was about how reformed she has been by Pierre; how her concern really does seem to be justice; that she is finding room to be concerned about people beyond herself. But I fear that she now stands on the edge. Already being cajoled back to the dark side by Eric Edelman \u2013 \u201cJos\u00e9phine, you are going against your true nature\u201d \u2013 she is also likely to be racked by the guilt of abandoning Pierre to his admiring onlookers. Just when she had her life on track \u2026 I could easily discuss Pierre for the whole of this blogpost \u2013 and I imagine that\u2019s what we\u2019ll mainly be doing in the comments \u2013 but after paying tribute to Gr\u00e9gory Fitoussi\u2019s fine performance in the role, I\u2019ll also bring us up to date with the case, which has progressed at some pace. The Jaulin murders So it is not St\u00e9phane Jaulin who has a link to the bank raiders but his murdered wife. (Perhaps: St\u00e9phane and Blanco still worked for the same company, and Blanco\u2019s job at Travelcity came via Zac). Sandrine knew Zac, and had turned a blind eye to his forged papers when renting him a flat in Asni\u00e8res. Blanco, with whom we spent a good deal of time this double bill, was useful only in terms of leading us to this Zacharai Gabbai, the ATM-raiders\u2019 ringleader now lost to les flics, but with his methods revealed. Given the trail of traumatised and dead people Zac leaves behind him \u2013 Blanco, poor Frank the ATM guy, Laetitia, Sandrine and child \u2013 it presumably won\u2019t be impossible to catch up with him. But you do feel that Laure, Gilou and Tintin had better pull their fingers out, given how quickly things appear to be escalating. Although I know, just typing that sentence, that I am basically becoming Herville. Herville was perhaps more annoying than ever this double bill, only a few French phrases away from an aggressive David Brent \u2013 \u201cIs he having his period?\u201d \u2013 but there were times when I shared his frustration. Although, equally, Tintin shooting the dog did also bring viewers one of those brilliantly gallic shrugs that Fremontin has down so well. Also worth bearing in mind: there is no match yet for the fingerprint on the slipper. And, of course, there is something properly dodgy going on with Dijbril, even if Tintin was unlikely to find out exactly what, driving around after him in a particularly obvious way. Les flics So Tintin has effectively left home and abandoned his children, and is now literally fighting his colleagues in the office. Oh, Fremontin! You must pull yourself together, and definitely stop lying to your wife about where you are when she\u2019s sitting in the office waiting for you. (\u201cDo you live here now?\u201d So busted.) So much for Gilou as the go-between: it was Laure who was doing the peacekeeping this week as she stopped her officers hurting each other. Tut tut. Laure does appear to be having second thoughts about the baby. After another man counselled her not to have an abortion \u2013 this time her pathologist friend, who clearly saw through her line of questioning \u2013 we saw her holding her stomach while she and Tintin rifled through a massive bin. (On which note: good detecting work, team, to realise it was a fake bomb). At least Gilou will be pleased, I suppose. Thoughts and observations \u2022 A quick note on the cleverness of Spiral in linking Jos\u00e9phine\u2019s victory for Laetitia with Laure\u2019s case and Pierre\u2019s client. And also on the political point made by the girl\u2019s release: with every intention of not returning to crime, the state\u2019s inability to find her a bed for the first night of her release saw her relapse in a fairly massive way. \u2022 Another quick note to say thank you for the explanations of France\u2019s civil/criminal proceedings in the comments last week. \u2022 Spiral never ducks violence or grisly details, but there has been a lot of really violent kicking this series. \u2022 \u201cYou\u2019ve become a feared judge. Congratulations.\u201d Or not, in fact. \u2022 \u201cShall I call you a doctor?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you call me an ambulance?\u201d I would not be surprised if Roban\u2019s furious putdown turns out to have been actually quite sensible advice. The nosebleeds are surely indicative of something more serious. \u2022 I enjoyed Laure\u2019s run in with Br\u00e9mont in a kind of unbearable-to-watch way. But I do rather wish she\u2019d just buy a bigger pair of trousers until she\u2019s made a pregancy decision. \u2022 I love that Tintin has a massive picture of Gilou\u2019s face appear on his phone when he rings. \u2022 More screentime for JP, who is always immaculately turned out \u2013 at least in comparison with his colleagues. \u2022 Was Laure really eating Kraft cheese slices? I\u2019m surprised they even exist in France."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
