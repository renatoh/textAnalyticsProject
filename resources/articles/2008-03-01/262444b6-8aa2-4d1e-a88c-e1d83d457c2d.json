Age: 7+ \"Anna Hibiscus lives in Africa. Amazing Africa.\" So begins each one of these entertaining and heart-warming stories about the everyday life of a little girl. Living in Africa as the child of two cultures - her mother is Canadian and her father African - the details of Anna Hibiscus's life are particular. She has a huge extended family each of whom regard being on one's own as a terrible fate. Her grandparents are properly respected and revered, and African traditions in clothes and food are carefully preserved and valued when relatives return from other countries. But, while this background gives a delightful and vivid picture of the specifics, the portrayal of Anna herself captures how it feels to be any little girl anywhere. A Fistful of Pearls and other tales from Iraq by Elizabeth Laird, illustrated by Shelley Fowles (Frances Lincoln, \u00a34.99). Age: 6+ These nine folk tales from Iraq involve stories disrupted by the kind of mischief and magic that is common to all folk traditions. The ruses employed by people and animals to deal with difficult situations are familiar, too, from the loving and unselfish youngest sister who wins the jinn's hand, to the hares who bring down the proud king of the elephants. But the wonder of this collection resides in the background details of the animals and in the language that Elizabeth Laird uses in these re-tellings. They make the stories seem refreshingly different and new-found, even though their origins are far in the past. \u00b7 This article was amended on Saturday March 8 2008. The author of the children's book Anna Hibiscus is Atinuke, not Atinuka as we said in the article above. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
