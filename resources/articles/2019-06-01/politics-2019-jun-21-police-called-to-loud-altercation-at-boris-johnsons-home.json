The argument could be heard outside the property where the potential future prime minister is living with Symonds, a former Conservative party head of press. A neighbour told the Guardian they heard a woman screaming followed by \u201cslamming and banging\u201d. At one point Symonds could be heard telling Johnson to \u201cget off me\u201d and \u201cget out of my flat\u201d. The neighbour said that after becoming concerned they knocked on the door but received no response. \u201cI [was] hoping that someone would answer the door and say \u2018We\u2019re okay\u2019. I knocked three times and no one came to the door.\u201d The neighbour decided to call 999. Two police cars and a van arrived within minutes, shortly after midnight, but left after receiving reassurances from both the individuals in the flat that they were safe. When contacted by the Guardian on Friday, police initially said they had no record of a domestic incident at the address. But when given the case number and reference number, as well as identification markings of the vehicles that were called out, police issued a statement saying: \u201cAt 00:24hrs on Friday, 21 June, police responded to a call from a local resident in [south London]. The caller was concerned for the welfare of a female neighbour. \u201cPolice attended and spoke to all occupants of the address, who were all safe and well. There were no offences or concerns apparent to the officers and there was no cause for police action.\u201d Johnson and Symonds have increasingly appeared together at public events in recent weeks. The former mayor of London topped Thursday\u2019s ballot of Conservative MPs in the party leadership contest and is now the favourite against Jeremy Hunt to be the next prime minister. The neighbour said they recorded the altercation from inside their flat out of concern for Symonds. On the recording, heard by the Guardian, Johnson can be heard refusing to leave the flat and telling Symonds to \u201cget off my fucking laptop\u201d before there is a loud crashing noise. Symonds is heard saying Johnson had ruined a sofa with red wine: \u201cYou just don\u2019t care for anything because you\u2019re spoilt. You have no care for money or anything.\u201d The neighbour said: \u201cThere was a smashing sound of what sounded like plates. There was a couple of very loud screams that I\u2019m certain were Carrie and she was shouting to \u2018get out\u2019 a lot. She was saying \u2018get out of my flat\u2019 and he was saying no. And then there was silence after the screaming. My partner, who was in bed half asleep, had heard a loud bang and the house shook.\u201d Johnson left his wife, Marina Wheeler, last year and began a relationship with Symonds, who has been credited with revitalising his appearance and approach to politics. She was part of his team when he publicly launched his campaign for the Tory leadership earlier this month. In recent weeks the couple have been sharing a flat in a converted Victorian house. It has been reported that they intend to move into Downing Street together if he is elected leader. Johnson\u2019s office was contacted earlier on Friday for comment but had not responded by the time of publication."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
