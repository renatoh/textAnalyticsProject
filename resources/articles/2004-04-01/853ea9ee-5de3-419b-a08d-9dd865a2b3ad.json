Only 5ft 7in, he has always punched well above his weight, just like his side, whose crowds average about 10,000. Against Chelsea tonight, he takes Monaco into their third Champions League semi-final in 11 years, the others achieved by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Jean Tigana, two men whose managerial careers blossomed in the Mediterranean principality. Unlike Wenger, who was mocked as \"Clouseau\" by Arsenal's senior players when he arrived there, Deschamps's achievements as a player commanded instant respect from his squad. More even than Tigana, he has 103 caps, a World Cup, a European Championship and two Champions League winners' medals as well as a total of five titles from Italy and France, the Coppa Italia and the FA Cup. There is perhaps no one in the game who can point to a more decorated playing career. But Deschamps had not intended management to come so soon when, in 2001, he hung up his boots aged 32. \"Didier was in contact with Monaco about joining them as a player, then they raised the subject of becoming the manager and he thought he would give it a try,\" said his agent Jeannot Werth. \"He never had a burning ambition to manage a club right now. It's something he did spontaneously when the opportunity came.\" His honours have given him immense pulling power. Even a seasoned campaigner such as Fernando Morientes, the Spain international who was a three-times European Cup winner at Real Madrid, had no hesitation in joining Deschamps's Monaco. Morientes, whose flagging career was revitalised by the move to the Stade Louis II and whose two headed goals helped knock Real Madrid out in the previous round, describes the Frenchman as \"phenomenal\". Yet his peripatetic playing career, which took in Nantes, Marseille, Bordeaux, Juventus, Chelsea and Valencia, did not lend itself to immediate success as a coach. Having left Marseille for Turin in 1994, he required a period of readjustment in his homeland. \"Didier had lost touch with French football during his years in Italy, England and Spain so he needed a few months to get used to it again,\" said Monaco's director of football Henri Biancheri. \"But I am not surprised by his achievements. He had a difficult first few months but then in his second season he finished second in the league and won the League Cup, so already you could say last year was very, very positive.\" A 15th-place finish in his first season as coach saw him criticised and accused by pundits of failing to handle his players. Though matters on the pitch improved dramatically in his second campaign, it was against a backdrop of intense external pressure. A debt estimated at \u00a335-55m led to Monaco's expulsion from France's top league, a decision overturned on appeal. In troubled times, only the force of Deschamps's personality kept his coveted players from flying the nest. \"At the end of last season all the players wanted to stay under him,\" recalled Biancheri. \"He had everyone's ear in the squad. He is an intelligent man and he tried to get the players around him. With all the noise that was going on around the club about the relegation and financial problems, he said don't worry, and the players believed him.\" Eric Cantona's famous \"water-carrier\" sneer notwithstanding, those who know him say Deschamps is above all else a \"leader\". Not afraid to raise his voice, he takes the man-management skills of France's World Cup-winning coach Aim\u00e9 Jacquet as his inspiration. In a youthful side in which the back four have an average age of 23, he finds a receptive audience. He is very attentive to his pastoral duties and can draw on the devastating impact of the death of his elder brother Philippe in an air crash, when he was 18. He says of the episode: \"It left a hole in my life nothing will ever fill.\" He has seldom spoken of it at length, even to his closest friends. Such conversations he reserves for his wife Claude, whom he met aged 17 at a party while at the Nantes academy and who offers him support and critical insight. After initially bringing in his own coaching team, he turned to club stalwarts. Jean Petit, previously assistant manager under Wenger but reduced to a scouting role, was reinstated as assistant and Antonio Pintus, whom he had got to know at Chelsea, became fitness coach. Pintus, an Italian whose spell at Chelsea was ended by Claudio Ranieri, is very much an adherent of Deschamps's underlying philosophy: hard graft produces results. \"Didier has built a team in his own image,\" said his former international colleague Emmanuel Petit. \"The team is very hard up but it has talent and works with humility. Everyone puts himself to the service of the squad but there is always a place for individuals to express themselves. He knows how to make players progress, both individually and collectively. That's the mark of a very good coach.\" When it comes to tactics, Deschamps has studied under one of the greats. \"I've got to know all kinds of coaches,\" he says. \"But on the technical front, I'm inspired by [Marcello] Lippi.\" And soon the apprentice may supplant his master. Though Deschamps denies encouraging any overtures, Juventus are casting covetous eyes. A win against Chelsea could be his stepping stone. Monaco's principal players are the real deal 30 Flavio Roma Goalkeeper Age 29 Caps 0 The Italian keeper was an unknown quantity when Didier Deschamps took over at Monaco as his club Lazio never used him. Having played for a string of teams in Serie B - Foggia, Chievo, Verona, Piacenza - he adapted quickly to Ligue 1. Against Real Madrid in the return leg of the quarter-final his performance was superb, making a great save to deny Zinedine Zidane on one occasion. 4 Hugo Ibarra Defender Age 30 Caps 6 For his first season at senior level, Ibarra has proved he can match the best centre-halves. \"Little Big Hugo\" has excellent vision and ball skills and his assist led to the all-important third Monaco goal against Real. 32 Ga\u00ebl Givet Defender Age 22 Caps 0 Another young and talented defender Givet learned his trade at the Monaco academy. This local product has matured into a very able centre-back who digs in when the going gets tough. He has also played for France Under-21. 27 Julien Rodriguez Defender Age 25 Caps 0 Rodriguez almost plays the role of the senior figure in a young back line. He is enjoying one of his best seasons at Stade Louis II having played at Monaco for the past six years. Rodriguez has also shone on the Champions League stage and is relishing the double-header against Chelsea. 8 Ludovic Giuly Midfielder Age 27 Caps 5 Having played for Lyon as a youngster Giuly joined Monaco in 1999 and has become an all-round midfielder. His goal tally is also impressive with 11 in the league and four in the Champions League, including two against Real. 3 Patrice Evra Defender Age 22 Caps 0 From Serie B with Monza to the Champions League, Evra has gone from obscurity to limelight. The life and career of the right-back is now in the fast lane. Not only can he defend, he also knows how to go forward and create goals, as his assist to set up Fernando Morientes against Real at the Louis II proved. 7 Lucas Bernardi Midfielder Age 26 Caps 0 The Argentinian came from one of the finest football academies in his native country - Newell's Old Boys - where he also started his career as a professional. After an unsuccessful spell with Marseille, Bernardi was identified by Monaco's scouts and has been a fine acquisition. 15 Vassilis Zikos Midfielder Age 29 Caps 14 The Greek midfielder was injured for the tie against Real but will be available for selection against Chelsea. 25 J\u00e9rome Rothen Midfielder Age 26 Caps 3 Having shown excellent leadership at his previous club Troyes, Rothen was poached by Monaco three years ago. He could be considered the Robert Pires of Monaco with distribution skills second to none and quality crosses. Now a full France international, he looks certain to be part of Les Bleus in Portugal 2004. 10 Fernando Morientes Forward Age 28 Caps 28 On loan from Real until the end of the season Morientes has been a big hit at Monaco. Always well positioned and good in the air, his timing in the penalty area is perfect. The Spaniard has scored seven Champions League goals this season, including two against Real. 18 Shabani Nonda Forward Age 27 Caps 3 This season has been like a seven-month itch for Nonda after a serious knee injury ruled him out. Outstanding last year for Monaco, the Congolese striker has now fully recovered and is sure to be on the shopping list of many big clubs during this summer's transfer window.
