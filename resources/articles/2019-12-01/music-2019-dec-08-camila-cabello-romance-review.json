The second Camila Cabello album, Romance, is giddy and frisky, but not to the point of nausea \u2013 thanks, mostly, to the Cuban-American superstar\u2019s charisma and the way she pointedly mutters \u201canything else?\u201d on Easy, one of a clutch of pre-album appetisers. Taylor Swift\u2019s Lover was faintly \u201cmeta\u201d, billed as being in love with love. Romance, by contrast, finds Cabello swooning with less of a wink and a nod, singing her relationship with Shawn Mendes. \u201cShawmila\u201d went official this year, yielding the inescapable Se\u00f1orita, a Latin-inflected hit whose utter naffness is offset somewhat by all the IRL billing and cooing. Liar, too, goes for the most obvious musical fashion: tropical pop, with Latin horns. But it credits the listener with a little more intelligence \u2013 as does Living Proof, with its off-beat handclap rhythms and ecstatic falsetto. On the unreleased tracks, genuine surprises are few. But the campy prowl of My Oh My and the high-stakes breathiness of Bad Kind of Butterflies keep the balance tilted away from syrupy dross, in favour of fun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
