As buzzards circled above and butterflies darted across the flower-dotted slopes, dozens of volunteers were digging and scraping at a huge figure carved into the steep hillside. The Cerne Abbas giant has loomed large above this Dorset valley for centuries, but 11 years after he was last spruced up, he and his impressive nether region were beginning to look a little faded. So on Wednesday an intrepid bunch of National Trust rangers, volunteers and archaeology experts clambered up the hill to help restore him to his former glory. \u201cIsn\u2019t he wonderful?\u201d said Diana Kimber, a Cerne villager who was lending a hand. \u201cHe\u2019s an important symbol for our area. We wouldn\u2019t lose him for anything.\u201d The history of the 55m (180ft) figure is lost in the mists of time, but Kimber reckons he has been there in one form or another for thousands of years. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what he stands for, but I think he may be the god of an ancient tribe that lived here many centuries ago. \u201cIt\u2019s right that we honour him by maintaining him. It\u2019s a real thrill to be here close to him among the butterflies and the flowers. And you get a better workout than at the gym.\u201d The task is, indeed, very tough. Sheep do the donkey work most of the time, chomping away at the grass to keep the giant visible, but for centuries every decade or so humans, fuelled by tea and cake, re-edge the figure, dig out the faded chalk and replace it. The whole process is done by hand with picks, shovels, brushes, tampers and some lung-bursting scrambles. It took 60 people nine days to finish the job in 2008 and about 20 tonnes of chalk will be used this time to make the giant visible for miles around again. No wonder Michael Clarke, the area ranger for west and north Dorset, urged volunteers to pace themselves. \u201cTake your time, don\u2019t go mad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hot, sweaty work.\u201d Martin Papworth, a National Trust archaeologist, was on hand to run through some of the theories behind the figure. Some, like Kimber, believe he may be many hundreds of years old and represent an ancient god. Candidates include Hercules, who is often shown naked with a club in his hand and a lion skin draped over his other arm. The club remains and it may be that the lion skin has vanished over time. Another school of thought has him as a Celtic god who once clutched a severed head, but many now believe he is much more modern, perhaps a caricature of Oliver Cromwell, pointing out that no reference is made to the figure in the many medieval documents that survive from nearby Cerne Abbey. \u201cIn truth, nobody really knows who he is,\u201d said Papworth. It is hard not to fixate on the figure\u2019s manhood, which has led some people to see the figure as a fertility symbol, inspiring a steady flow of courting couples to leap the fence and set up camp on or close to his private parts. Papworth produced a copy of the first image of the figure, dated 1763, in which the appendage is not as large. \u201cIn the 1950s and 60s contractors maintained the figure,\u201d said Papworth. He suggested that a gang of them might have thought it would be a lark to make him more impressive. Another villager, Rupert Valpy, said the debate about the private parts was a \u201cbit of fun\u201d that the locals enjoyed. \u201cOne of the lovely things about it is that nobody knows exactly why and when he appeared here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut from the village\u2019s point of view he\u2019s a very good asset. The shop might not be able to carry on if it wasn\u2019t for the giant. He\u2019s certainly a good thing.\u201d The scene may look like something out of Thomas Hardy, but modern problems impinge even here. Natalie Holt, the countryside manager for the National Trust, said tweaks to the way the giant is cared for may have to be made because of the climate crisis. \u201cShould we experience more frequent and severe rains, it may mean it requires more frequent chalking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe may also have to alter the timing, duration and number of sheep grazing the hillside in order to keep the grass short enough so the giant can be seen. This could be a tricky balance to find.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
