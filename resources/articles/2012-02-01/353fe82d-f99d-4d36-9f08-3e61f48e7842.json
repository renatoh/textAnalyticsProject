One such involves the photojournalist Ray Bellisario, who was taking unguarded photos of the royals back in the 1960s. \"Peeping Tom\" they called him, and he seemed a particular irritant to Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret. Daily Mail writer Ann Leslie recounts meeting Margaret in the Bahamas. The princess was still cross, having been photographed in a swimming costume by her bete noire. A helicopter flew overhead. Margaret flew into a rage. \"It's that bloody Bellisario!\", she said. It wasn't. He caused more trouble, snapping the Queen apparently walking out with the abdicated outcast Duke of Windsor. So there's plenty of bad blood there. And Leveson now has evidence of the extent to which the enmity endures, in the form of a Sunday Times magazine column from late last year in which Lord Snowdon was given a platform to swipe at a longtime enemy. \"We'd often see paparazzi lurking around and it made you feel rather angsty,\" he said. \"There was an awful one called Ray Bellisario. He was a nasty man. He'd sit by the lake and just watch us. Of course, all he really wanted was to get Princess Margaret falling over. It was horrid.\" We're not having that, say relatives of Bellisario, who is now 76. It's \"libellous, malicious, vindictive\". We want a right of reply. Nothing doing, says the Sunday Times, hence the complaint to Leveson. This may endure some time yet. The Belli in Bellisario means \"war\" in Latin. \u2022 Slights and slanders. There's a lot of it about, with a distressing amount to be sourced from across the Channel. Where to start? Should it be the diplomatic incident between France and Spain, which began when the TV station Canal Plus broadcast a skit casting Spanish sportsmen, including Rafa Nadal, as potential drug abusers? Or the allegations which have more domestic relevance, to be found splashed over the front page of the French edition of Closer magazine. It says Kate and Wills of Windsor have been arguing a lot, that she's fed up of being left alone and things are \"very tense\" right now, a terrible situation that is only being exacerbated by his military absences. All of it reliant on two quotes from \"sources close to Kate\". And will the British edition of Closer be running this stuff, we ask? They say, no way. \u2022 Does one detect stirrings of compassion among our theatre critics? Poor old Russell Tovey, writes the Sunday Telegraph's Tim Walker. The actor has to get it on with Jaime Winstone in Sex With a Stranger at the Trafalgar Studios. And on the night in question, Tovey had to perform, as it were, with three distracting figures seated just a few feet away in the front row. \"It occurred to me that if this grizzly trio didn't prove a passion killer for Tovey, nothing would,\" wrote Walker. \"Rubenesque\", was how he described them. Genuine concern, or just another swipe at fellow critics Ian Shuttleworth of the Financial Times and Paul Taylor of the Independent, both of whom were indeed close up, monitoring the action? From our vantage point at the back of the stalls, it's hard to know. \u2022 All change! For annually there is a \"glittering awards ceremony\", as sponsors describe it, to celebrate all that is best about policing in Britain. The lavish bash, held at the Savoy, is jointly organised with the Police Federation and has always been a way for the sponsor to recognise the very difficult and taxing job that policing is. This year's event, due in the summer, should be intriguing. For who is this sponsor that annually salutes the bravery of officers for carrying out their often thankless task without fear or favour? A newspaper called the Sun. It'll be wine gums and crisps, if anything at all, this year. \u2022 And with that in mind, a message to victims of crime throughout Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. According to the Bucks Free Press, the local force, Thames Valley, has itself been relieved of a truncheon, \"five blue strobe flashing lights\", handcuffs valued at \u00a332.69, and a six-foot tall cardboard officer that was stolen from High Wycombe station. So, if nothing else, they feel your pain. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
