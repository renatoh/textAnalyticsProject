In the dictionary, it is defined as courage, pluck, valour, fearlessness, nerve, daring, heroism, gallantry. In football, it is wounded centre-back Terry Butcher, his bloodied, bandaged head and claret-and-white shirt in an England World Cup qualifier against Sweden in Stockholm in 1989. Or perhaps, rather less gruesomely, it is a 10-man team holding on for a draw after their captain had been sent off in the 25th minute. Football loves its bravery, its red-stained and/or against-the-odds warriors, whether it is just hyped tosh or otherwise. Yet just consider the take on it of Roberto Mart\u00ednez \u2013 and that it centres on Ross Barkley, the 21-year-old Everton and England midfielder, makes it all the more enlightening. Barkley may not be courageous, fearless or heroic. But he does the hard yards regularly and, even when the force is not with him and it is all going pear-shaped, he never hides on the dark fringes or petulantly chides his team-mates for their pathetic frailties. Mart\u00ednez, after a facile victory against a strangely and uncharacteristically lethargic Southampton, was posed the question: \u201cEven when things are not coming off, Ross still wants the ball?\u201d \u201cI think that\u2019s quite unique,\u201d the manager replied. \u201cWhen we develop young players [in England], I don\u2019t think we credit that sort of bravery. Sometimes you get confused that it is all about going strong in tackles and trying to win 50-50 balls. That bravery is part of the intensity of the whole game. \u201cBut the bravery that Ross has is that he will show for the ball from any angle, he\u2019ll want it, he\u2019ll try to be positive and make things happen for the team. When he gets in the box, when he controls the situation, that is the sign of an incredible footballer.\u201d Barkley, allied to the bulldozing talents of Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku, dismantled Southampton with almost embarrassing ease. Lukaku scored twice in the first half \u2013 a precise header and, after being set up by Barkley\u2019s pass, a cool finish for his second \u2013 and then Barkley delicately curled in Everton\u2019s third goal towards end. Southampton overachieved last season, finishing seventh. Yet at times here they appeared as incapacitated as Ronald Koeman, who is still struggling on crutches after achilles tendon surgery. A moderately improved second-half display, the pick of which forced Tim Howard to save spectacularly from Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s 30-yard drive, only flattered to deceive. Expectation has risen on the south coast. \u201cIt\u2019s the small details but they\u2019re important and we have to improve,\u201d the manager said, before hobbling off to contemplate another foray into Europe on Thursday. After disposing of Vitesse Arnhem 5-0 on aggregate in their Europa League qualifier, they now host the Danish side Midtjylland in the first leg of their play-off round tie. Victory and the group stage of the competition awaits. And with it, its energy-sapping midweek trips and the Thursday-Sunday fixture schedules that can derail any serious notions of further progress in the Premier League. Saints or sinners? It is a fine margin, to be determined a few months hence for Koeman and co. Hopefully, the former. For Everton, Mart\u00ednez is just appreciative thatRoy Hodgson, watching on Saturday, bothered to check on his Three Lions contingent \u2013 Barkley, Tom Cleverley, Phil Jagielka, John Stones and even 19-year-old left-back Brendan Galloway, who is deputising for the injured Leighton Baines. None will have disappointed Hodgson. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be impressed with the feeling of the team that we had today,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said of he England manager. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that he\u2019ll be surprised by Ross at all.\u201d If Barkley sparkled, Lukaku provided a muscular explosion. \u201cYou want him to be enjoying his football and then he can be unplayable,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the talent, he\u2019s as good as he wants to be.\u201d Lukaku may be courageous, fearless and heroic, as befits an out-and-out striker. Barkley may not be. But in the eyes of Mart\u00ednez \u2013 and perhaps Hodgson, too - Barkley\u2019s relative bravery is to be hugely admired.
