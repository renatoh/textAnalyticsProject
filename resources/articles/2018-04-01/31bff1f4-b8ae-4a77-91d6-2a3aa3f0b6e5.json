Southampton\u2019s St Mary\u2019s Stadium is expected to have a crowd of 23,000 for this top-of-the-table clash in Group One. Wales are leaders by a point from England, though they have played a game more. Neville\u2019s side have a 100% record and last month finished the SheBelieves Cup in the US as runners\u2011up, but he says his team must guard against complacency if they are to continue in his stated aim of becoming the best team in the world. \u201cTo walk out at a Premier League stadium with England Women will be a great honour for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt surpasses anything that I\u2019ve ever achieved as a player. But it\u2019s not really about me, it\u2019s about the players. I think the players are more excited than I am because it\u2019s a big World Cup qualifying game. Wales are top of the group so by the end of Friday we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re back top of the group. Where we believe we should be. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken for the last two months about wanting to win the World Cup, but we\u2019ve got to qualify for it first. We\u2019re not taking that for granted. We\u2019re playing a Wales team that\u2019s well coached, well organised. They have got some individuals that can cause problems. But my team are used to playing big games, they\u2019re not intimidated by them and in fact it\u2019s something they\u2019re looking forward to. They\u2019ve got the attitude of \u2018bring it on\u2019. That\u2019s what\u2019s been impressive this week. \u201cNow it\u2019s about going out there and playing in the style I want them to play. Having the confidence to go out there, that\u2019s the most important thing. When I came out of SheBelieves the thing I thought was that the team need more belief in the style that I want to play. You\u2019re playing for England, I want them to play with a certain arrogance, swagger and style.\u201d Neville says that his experience at the SheBelieves Cup and the past two days of training on the south coast have proven invaluable in building an understanding with his new squad. \u201cAs a coach you\u2019ve got to connect with your players and the moments away from the training pitch are the most quality times,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause players played on Sunday the first day and a half of this week were recovery days so I managed to have individual meetings with every single one. \u201cMy management style is to tell the players where they stand in my squad and what I think they need to become best in their position in the world. It\u2019s as simple as that. It\u2019s about how are we going to become the best in the world and it\u2019s the last 5% that\u2019s always the hardest. I\u2019ve outlined my plan to the team as individuals this week. I expect them to perform for their clubs like I expect them to play for England. That\u2019s where I really want to raise the bar. We\u2019ve got 10-12 players who could compete on the world-class level. I want 23 or more.\u201d Neville says he expects more Lionesses matches to be played at Premier League stadiums and for them to return to Wembley, as demand among fans grows. \u201cI think it shows where the game\u2019s going that we\u2019re now filling Premier League stadiums,\u201d he said. \u201cI have fixture meetings all the time and the picture for the next year is that people are now looking at bigger venues, better stadiums against top opposition. There will be another England game at Wembley, that\u2019s something I think the FA are committed to. We\u2019ve got a Premier League stadium that\u2019s going to be packed to the rafters, full of people coming to support my team, and that should fill us all with excitement.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
