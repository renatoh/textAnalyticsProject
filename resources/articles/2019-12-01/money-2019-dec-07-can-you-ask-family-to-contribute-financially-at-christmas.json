My brother and his partner (in their early 30s) live in a one-bed flat and never host the family Christmas \u2013 they always come to us. We\u2019ve never asked for cash before, but it\u2019s quite a burden, given they eat and drink a lot, and stay for a week or more. How do other people handle this situation? Do you have a problem readers could solve?
