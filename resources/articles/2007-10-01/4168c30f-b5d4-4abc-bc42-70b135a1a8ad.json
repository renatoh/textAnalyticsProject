Brady, who won 72 caps with the Republic during a glittering playing career, has worked since 1996 as Arsenal's academy manager and head of youth development. He is considering a career move after Steve Staunton's dismissal by the Football Association of Ireland and has broached the subject with Wenger. The Arsenal manager does not want to lose Brady, who has presided over a system that in recent years has produced Ashley Cole, David Bentley and Steve Sidwell among others. But Wenger would not stand in Brady's way were he to be offered the chance to succeed Staunton. It is thought unlikely that Brady would be able to combine his current job with that of Ireland manager because of the potential conflict of interest. Brady, who also works as a pundit with RTE, the Irish television channel, would have to impress an independent panel of football experts, selected by the FAI. The governing body believes that, in light of the disappointment with Staunton, it is preferable for a group with a \"professional background\" in the game, rather than the FAI itself, to make the appointment. It will offer the consultants, whom it intends to select over the next 10 days, logistical support and it will then ratify the man they put forward. \"I will not have a direct role in relation to the appointment of the new manager,\" said John Delaney, the FAI chief executive. \"It's best to leave it this time to others who have the professional background to go and make this kind of appointment and the board of the FAI will accept that. \"The most important aspect of this is to get people to do the job for us. That is the crucial point. I see my key skills as an administrator. Football professionals will go and deal with the appointment of our next manager. That's the way it should be and that's the way it will be. They [the consultants] will come with one name. We will then ratify that regardless of any reservations. It will be completely external.\" Brady would appear an ideal candidate for the independent selection panel but his desire for the manager's job would presumably preclude him. Another likely panellist, John Giles, the former Republic international and another RTE pundit, ruled himself out. \"I would be totally compromised in my work as a newspaper and TV pundit,\" he said. If the procedure seemed incongruous, a football body contracting out the biggest football decision it can take, Delaney sought to highlight the positive work that he and the FAI do. \"There's been great progress in the FAI over the last number of years,\" he said. \"Most of my time is spent on Lansdowne Road redevelopment, moving [the FAI HQ] to Abbotstown, the Eircom League merger and about 160 staff; we've got development officers in most parts of Ireland. Last year we played 165 internationals. We had a turnover of \u20ac45m. They're the things I've got to get on with.\" Lee Carsley, the Everton midfielder, said he was \"not fussy about who comes in\" but was sorry to see Staunton go. \"It is never nice to see anyone lose their job. The players have got to take some responsibility for that.\" In the frame David O'Leary, 49 Aston Villa 2003-2006 13-8 favourite Known to be interested, is Irish and has Premier League experience.
