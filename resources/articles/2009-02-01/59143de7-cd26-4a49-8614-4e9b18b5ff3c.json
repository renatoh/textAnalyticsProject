In a statement, Obama thanked legislators of both parties for the \"hard-fought compromise\" on the plan that \"will provide immediate tax relief to families and businesses, while investing in priorities like healthcare, education, energy, and infrastructure that will grow our economy once more\". The deal, reached in closed-door meetings between House and Senate negotiators and White House officials, comes just a day after three moderate Republicans joined Senate Democrats to pass an $838bn version. The House last month passed an $820bn version with no Republican votes. The two houses of Congress must now vote on the compromise bill, which could reach Obama's desk within days. \"The middle ground we've reached creates more jobs than the original Senate bill and spends less than the original House bill,\" Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, one of the participants in the lightening-speed negotiations, said at the Capitol. Republicans have blasted the various versions of the package, saying it includes too much wasteful spending and does not provide enough in tax cuts. \"This unprecedented spending of taxpayer dollars is not timely, targeted nor temporary, and it fails to address the underlying problems with the economy,\" said Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \"American families know they have a limit on spending their hard-earned money, but now they must be wondering if the government has any limits on spending it for them.\" Representative Peter King, a New York Republican, said today he doubted the compromise bill would attract any House Republican votes. \"I would say it's probably unlikely,\" he said on MSNBC television. \"There's probably still too much spending in it as opposed to actual tax relief.\" The compromise includes funds for unemployment benefits, food stamps, health insurance coverage, road and bridge construction, and more, and extends $44bn to the states that are grappling with painful budget cuts. The legislation also preserves Obama's signature tax cut for poor and middle-income Americans. The stimulus package has been Obama's top priority since taking office, and he has vigorously promoted it in the halls of Congress, in private meetings with legislators and at campaign-style rallies. \"Enacting this plan is both urgent and essential to our recovery,\" he said in Virginia today before the deal was announced."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
