Mutu was upset to find himself fourth in the pecking order of strikers behind Didier Drogba, Mateja Kezman and Eidur Gudjohnsen on Chelsea's US tour and on his return requested a meeting with the manager Jose Mourinho to thrash out his future. When Mourinho indicated that the 25-year-old Romanian would remain bottom of the forward hierarchy, Mutu told his agents Andrea Pretti and Giovani Becali he was ready to accept an offer from Juventus. \"We talked with [Chelsea's chief executive] Peter Kenyon in the morning and he told us that they were ready to let the player go on loan,\" Pretti said. \"Then we had some small problems because Roman Abramovich didn't find the deal particularly convenient for Chelsea. \"We continued negotiations and finally reached another agreement with the help of Mourinho, who was keen to give Mutu the chance of playing on regular basis for another club. I believe that Mutu will sign for Juventus [this] morning.\" Chelsea's website last night was at pains to emphasise that the deal had yet to be concluded. Juventus are in the market for a forward after selling Marco di Vaio to Valencia and the coach Fabio Capello had never hidden his desire to land Mutu, who has been earmarked as a partner for David Trezeguet as Alessandro Del Piero has fallen from favour. Mutu will become the third player to be loaned by Chelsea to a Serie A club after Juan S\u00e9bastian V\u00e9ron and Hernan Crespo, who joined Internazionale and Milan respectively. Pretti said: \"The loan deal is for free but Juve will pay the whole salary of the player next season.\" Mutu is believed to be on \u00a340,000 a week at Chelsea. The option for Juventus to buy up 50% of the player's licence next summer will allow Chelsea to recoup some of the \u00a315.8m they paid last year to take the Romanian from Parma. \"I cannot confirm officially the economic details of the operation because we are still negotiating some small details with both clubs, but I think that the figures are almost correct,\" Pretti said. Mutu, signed by Inter in 1999 after scoring 22 goals in 33 matches for Dinamo Bucharest, played only 10 games for the Nerazzurri without scoring a goal. In 2000 he was sold to Verona for \u00a33m. In 2001-02 he scored 12 goals in 32 Serie A games, and Parma then payed \u00a37m for his services. At the Tardini stadium he had his most productive season in Italy, with 18 goals in 31 games, attracting the interest of Abramovich's Chelsea. Chelsea are taking a risk in letting Mutu go as yesterday Kezman was handed a three-match ban by the Football Association following his sending off against Roma during last week's friendly in the US. However the Serbian striker is free to face Manchester United in the Premiership opener as his ban starts on August 17, but he will miss the matches against Birmingham, Crystal Palace and Southampton. Pre-season games are not subject to the fast-track disciplinary system to be introduced for competitive matches this season, so this suspension starts 14 days from receipt of the official report. Kezman, a \u00a35.3m signing from PSV, was dismissed for an altercation with Olivier Dacourt following a hack by the France midfielder on Arjen Robben. Chelsea felt that because the Serb sat out the next match of their tour, he had served his punishment. However the FA does not regard friendlies as counting towards any ban. Chelsea are, nevertheless, entitled to an appeal for wrongful dismissal, which must be lodged within 14 days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
