That trust is being betrayed", "bodyText": "Two years ago, a human horror unfolded. The Grenfell Tower fire was one of the worst preventable disasters in modern UK history, resulting in the deaths of 72 people. A fire forewarned, as residents\u2019 concerns about safety went unheard. Recommendations from an inquest held in 2013 into the Lakanal House fire in south London were ignored. Two years after a public inquiry into Grenfell was announced, not a single recommendation has been made to protect others and prevent future deaths. Since the disaster, the charity Inquest has been working with and supporting families of those who died. Recently we held a consultation day where for the first time bereaved people shared their experiences. The report Family Reflections on Grenfell: No Voice Left Unheard highlights their shared frustrations and anger. Bereaved people reflected on the chaos and lack of organisation in the aftermath of the fire, and were critical of the government response at both a local and national level. They also voiced their serious concerns with the inquiry process. These included the uncertain time frames, unsuitable venue, lack of interim recommendations and disclosure of evidence, frustrations that their lawyers cannot question witnesses directly and the lack of candour from the state and corporate bodies involved. They also spoke positively of the commemoration hearings and how this humanised the process and directly involved the bereaved, survivors and community. This was an example of how an inquiry can properly engage with those affected. But it is an example the inquiry itself currently appears incapable of following. It is to this public inquiry that families have had to turn as their means of finding out how and why their loved ones died. They were promised that no stone would be left unturned and that their voices would be heard. However, they have had to fight at every stage for their rights. Families want to have trust in the process but described frustration and anger at their lack of meaningful participation. One person said: \u201cIt\u2019s very important for the bereaved to have more of a role. We don\u2019t want to have to fight to get the evidence to find out exactly what happened. \u201cParticipation in a meaningful way is what would give the inquiry credibility. Justice must be seen to be done.\u201d Playing a meaningful role in the inquiry is important for bereaved people who have suffered unspeakable trauma and cannot properly begin to grieve until they have found out the truth. This is vital to recovery and healing. Families spoke to Inquest of the impact on their daily lives, the difficulty of trying to manage family life and work with no inquiry dates and time frames, being left in a state of limbo and the stress and anxiety that brings. For months, families were led to believe that the inquiry would be publishing the phase one report in the spring of 2019, only to be told in May that the report would be delayed until October 2019. As Natasha Elcock, chair of the survivors and bereaved families group Grenfell United, said: \u201cThat we are only finding this out now, when we were expecting the report to be published ahead of the two-year anniversary, shows how they continue to disregard survivors and bereaved through this process.\u201d The one thing all families have in common is their desire to get to the truth of what happened, for those responsible to be held to account and to prevent something like this ever happening again. There is a desire to ensure that this is a thorough public inquiry, but there is also a demand for interim recommendations as soon as possible to protect others. Families feel that interim recommendations would signal a decisive move towards making buildings safer, improving emergency services responses, and providing reassurance to families that their relatives\u2019 deaths marked a sea change in housing policy. The longer it takes for the inquiry to make recommendations, the longer the risk of further preventable loss of life remains. This is failing the families and survivors who placed their trust in this inquiry. It is failing those who continue to feel unsafe in their homes. It would be welcome for the chair of this inquiry to have a public hearing to discuss his decisions regarding interim recommendations, time frames and facts in relation to individual deaths. The inquiry has not sat publicly since December 2018; a public hearing is long overdue. Across Inquest\u2019s work on state-related deaths we see the interests of powerful institutions and corporate bodies prevailing over the access of bereaved people to the truth and accountability about how and why their relatives died. Evidence of systemic failings and human rights abuses is often only brought to light through the determination of families who have had to fight tooth and nail for answers, against a background of delay, denial and defensiveness. These processes can last decades, and Gosport hospital, contaminated blood and Hillsborough are just some examples of that. The impact on the physical and mental health of these families during these protracted processes is immense. This must not happen to those affected by Grenfell. It is high time the inquiry team and the government listened to these voices. This inquiry must deliver truth, justice and accountability, and do so in a transparent way. \u2022 Deborah Coles is the executive director of Inquest, an independent charity working with families bereaved by state-related deaths"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
