These are a choice of words and a proposal that put him on a collision course with certain Labour councils, such as the London boroughs of Haringey and Southwark, at whose deals with developers the accusation of \u201csocial cleansing\u201d is often aimed. In deals such as Haringey\u2019s proposed rebuilding of the Northumberland Park estate in Tottenham, the local authority hopes to salvage an amount of affordable homes from the wholesale replacement and up-marketing of swaths of housing in deprived areas. Social cleansing is a metastasis of gentrification, the phenomenon familiar to prosperous and reviving cities \u2013 Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol and especially London \u2013 which by accident and design has been elevated to the status of public policy. Traditionally, it takes the form of educated, middle-class types \u2013 academic, media, creative, political \u2013 moving into rundown areas, such as the London borough of Islington once was, and helping to raise the area\u2019s attractiveness and value by using their energy, connections and abilities to organise and campaign. People not unlike Corbyn, in fact. Under regeneration programmes from the 1990s onwards, public investment in improving such neighbourhoods has had the effect \u2013 inevitable in the sort-of-free housing market that we have \u2013 of increasing property values. Such increases, indeed, were often stated objectives and markers of success. The \u201crenewal\u201d of dozens of council estates, by demolishing thousands of homes and rebuilding in larger numbers, with a high proportion for market sale or rent, goes one step further. This is when gentrification gets called \u201csocial cleansing\u201d. Mere mention of the G-word will bring a reaction from the bien-pensant gallery and there\u2019s reason for their outrage. We know what the problems can be \u2013 residents pushed out by rising prices, their old sources of employment closed down, shops and cafes that stop serving their needs. Research by Historic England (published in the new book Dispersal: Picturing Urban Change in East London) reveals that 31% of the businesses relocated for the Olympics, which was touted as an opportunity to revive deprived London boroughs, have since closed, with the loss of an estimated 887 jobs. Gentrification can change the character of a place and create the feeling that residents, in whose name regeneration is carried out, no longer belong. \u201cTottenham is a bit of a dump,\u201d Keith Flett of Haringey TUC once told Dave Hill in the Guardian, \u201cbut there\u2019s a strong constituency in the area that actually quite likes that, strange as it may seem, because with it comes a very strong community feeling and network.\u201d But before going down the easy route of condemnation it\u2019s worth pausing to ask exactly what gentrification is and whether it is all bad. It is such a vast, ill-defined term, a great catch-all of assumed harm \u2013 one often brandished, it has been pointed out, by precisely those educated, middle-class urban types who practise it \u2013 that it should be asked what, after all, gentrification does for us? As Flett also said: \u201cI don\u2019t see why Tottenham should be deprived of modern facilities.\u201d Rushanara Ali, MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, grew up in the area she represents, in the London borough of Tower Hamlets, which exemplifies the trajectory of gentrification \u2013 from alleged slum, to artists\u2019 quarter, to incipient playground and dormitory of tech workers and employees of financial institutions. Gentrification at its best, she says, means more money and jobs \u2013 although too often not enough go to those already there \u2013 and improvement in the physical environment. Gentrification also means effective alliances of incomers and existing disadvantaged communities to fight destructive development, as happened with the 2015 campaign to save the threatened Holland estate, in Tower Hamlets, a successful piece of public housing, from destruction. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve just got poor and vulnerable communities it\u2019s harder to fight these things off,\u201d says Ali. It can help schools as well, she says, if middle-class arrivals send their children there, contribute their networks and knowledge and help make them more socially and racially mixed. (She is, however, keen to stress that improvement in education in the borough has mainly been driven by the achievements of Bangladeshi girls.) Speak to people caught up in regeneration schemes \u2013 or \u201cestate renewal\u201d \u2013 and they will often be pleased by the proposed changes, the new homes, open spaces, sports facilities. Happy so long as these things happen and, crucially, so long as they still have a home after the work is done. Which is the rub. Sam Leggatt, a resident of Northumberland Park, in Tottenham, north London, told the Guardian of her anger at the absence of guarantees that she could get a new home after her current one was demolished. Mistrust here is increased by the fact that the council\u2019s development partner is Lendlease, the company that notoriously converted more than 1,000 socially rented homes at the Heygate estate in Southwark into about 80. It all depends, in other words, on how you do it. Opponents of estate renewal, such as Anna Minton in her recent book Big Capital: Who Is London For?, tend to focus on the palpable failings of the Heygate and its near neighbour the Aylesbury estate, without acknowledging that in some cases high property values have helped London councils fund more, better designed, better quality affordable homes than they had before. It is not that estate renewal is intrinsically wrong, but that the difference between good and bad comes down to the numbers of genuinely affordable housing that are gained or lost. It is also true of gentrification generally that it depends how you do it. For Ali, it requires an effort by incomers to integrate \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m really tired of black and Asian people being told to integrate and not the white middle class.\u201d There is also a \u201cpoint of optimum benefit\u201d, before property prices go so high as to create disparities that cannot be bridged and force out the teachers and social workers on whom an area depends. The dilemma is that, in a system dependent on the property market, investment in the increased attractiveness of an area translates into higher prices, which ultimately translate into exclusion. Here, Corbyn\u2019s proposals for building more public housing and for rent controls could, depending on the detail, make a difference. But successful improvement, or transformation, or regeneration, or whatever you want to call it, means paying close attention to what is actually there. This applies to both proponents and opponents. For Olympic-style boosters, it means noticing that shabby-looking businesses actually provide valuable jobs and perform useful services or that existing communities have their own, non-monetary value. For those who decry gentrification or regeneration in all its forms, it means noticing when it works."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
