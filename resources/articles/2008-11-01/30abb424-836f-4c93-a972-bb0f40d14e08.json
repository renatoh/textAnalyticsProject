Wilson, 28, hit a third-round 69 to move to the top of the leaderboard, but managed only two holes of his final round before bad light brought a halt to play. In difficult conditions, Ogilvy followed up a second-round 65 with a third-round 70, and was paired with Wilson on his final round when the day's play was abandoned. Defending champion Phil Mickelson, who completes the final group alongside Wilson and Ogilvy, is two behind on 10 under alongside Sergio Garcia. Wilson, who is playing the event courtesy of his Order of Merit ranking after finishing runner-up four times in 2008, made a straightforward par at the first hole on his final round, and saved par at the second after finding sand off his drive. Along with Ogilvy and Mickelson he has a birdie putt awaiting him on the third green when play resumes on Monday morning. The Englishman revealed he was happy to get the initial holes of the final round underway before the weather interrupted. \"It didn't do any harm playing the few holes, it was nice and steady,\" he said. \"I hit one bad shot at the second which cost me a birdie, but I have a birdie chance at three from 10-12 feet. I had the option to putt out. We had teed off and then they blew [the hooter] but we wanted to hit the shot in as the wind was calm and we were in the flow. But it was getting a little too dark to putt and I didn't want to miss it and be thinking about that overnight. I have something to get me going early on in the morning.\" The other incident of note in the disrupted day was the disqualification of world No3 Anthony Kim for using a damaged driver. The 23-year-old American Ryder Cup player caught the club on a sprinkler head while walking down the seventh fairway, but proceeded to use it off the eighth tee. The rules state that any player who damages a club other than during normal play and subsequently uses it or replaces it is disqualified. \"I hit a driver off the tee and I was walking with it as I usually do, I wasn't angry, I was just walking down the fairway and the tip of the club hit the top of the sprinkler,\" Kim revealed. \"I looked at it and it looked a little bit different, but I wasn't sure. I put it in the bag and on eight during my practice swing I looked down and it looked a little bit different,\" said Kim. \"I hit it and it went 150 yards, I didn't think anything of it. I hit a provisional as that ball was out of play, but that ball went 100 yards right, way shorter and I looked down and it looked worse. \"I found a rules official and told them what happened and they told me if it had changed it was a disqualification. I was pretty shocked, I didn't know that was the case, but the rules are the rules.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
