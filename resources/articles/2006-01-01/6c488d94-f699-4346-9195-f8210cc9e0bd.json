An hour of tossing and turning later and the inevitable post-Christmas revellers arrived: \"Hello sweats. Hello shakes. Hello fever. Hello guilt. Hello self-loathing. Hello fear. Hello no sleep for six hours. Hello rats.\" But as we succumbed to the horrors of alcohol withdrawal, clutching the edge of our duvets under our chins while staring in wide-eyed terror at the assorted snakes and sharks emerging from the walls, we could at least console ourselves with the knowledge that, compared to the constant nocturnal torment endured by under-fire Premiership managers such as Bernard Cribbins, we were probably having a great night's kip. But the Bongo FC gaffer might sleep a little easier in his bed tonight, having secured the scrawl of striker Chris Sutton (62), who today left Celtic by mutual consent. \"It has been very disappointing for me to leave Celtic but, under the circumstances, I felt I had no choice,\" harrumphed Sutton, indicating the aforementioned consent was far more mutual on their part than it was on his. \"I'm looking forward to playing for Bongo FC,\" he continued, failing to address the fact he was only bought because their rhythm money wasn't good enough for Barcelona's Henrik Larsson. Meanwhile at the Theatre Of Tedium, Steve McClaren has been told to sell before he can buy, not least because Middlesbrough have finally recorded the first average Premiership attendance in minus figures. Accordingly, the 'For Sale' signs have been hung around the necks of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Ray Parlour and Ugo Ehiogu, whose subsequent whooping, hollering and involuntary shaking could probably be attributed to excitement rather than potentially fatal payback for Christmas excesses. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"You can't tell me that their players and manager will not want to go to some of the European super clubs in the next few years. Chelsea may have the resources to pay top wages, but the best players and managers will want to prove themselves at the Nou Camp, the Bernabeu, GlazerDome or the San Siro\" - Gary Neville tries to take on the English champions with the mental warfare approach ... and unsurprisingly comes off second best. ********************* AND HEAVEN KNAAS THEY'RE MISERABLE NOO The Tyneside area has accounted for 98.6% of Samaritans' time in the last few weeks, but it's not just the fans warming to the idea of a hot bath and a carefully administered Gillette. Environmentalists have warned that were Big Sam Allardyce, Graeme Souness and Fat Freddy Shepherd to be placed in the same room, the atmosphere would be rendered unable to support meaningful life within 83 seconds. And Freddy's emergence after weeks of lock-picking would do nothing to raise Toon spirits. Sam's got the hump because he keeps being linked with the Turbo2000\u00a9 EjectorSeat at NUCC. \"I do not like being linked to a club where another manager is in the job,\" he barked today, which usually translates as: I don't mind taking over this comedy club just so long as you clear out the remains of the previous compere first. \"It is unfair on me, it is unfair on this club and unfair on Graeme Souness,\" he hastily added. \"It just adds to the pressure.\" That pressure, in case you hadn't noticed, stems from the 1839m Bramble-buttock-shaped bricks raining down on Souness. Sheltering under an increasingly threadbare umbrella marked 'injuries', however, Souey is determined to see out the storm. \"There is no chance of me resigning whatever happens. I am sticking at it, there is not a chance of me walking away, not now, not ever,\" he declared. Rough translation: if I'm leaving, I'm taking my \u00a33m contract-severance package with me. And that big, fat pay-off would have to be coughed grudgingly up the big, fat gullet of Mr Shepherd - who is still sore after paying off Souey's predecessor Rir Sobby Bobson, hence his less than festive Christmas mood. And it can't have helped that poor old Freddy has handed over almost \u00a350m in transfer fees since Souey arrived, much of which is blundering around the pitch in the shape of Celestine Babayaro and Jean-Alain Boumsong, causing their chairman to wince with every swing and hoof at fresh air. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Middlesbrough boss Steve McClaren wants to buy Atletico Madrid winger Luciano Galletti and teach him the art of boring football. When in doubt, buy another striker: that's the Real Madrid mantra, with Empoli's Francesco Tavano topping their wanted list. He was happy to splash \u00a37m on Peter Crouch, but unless Benfica reduce their \u00a310m demands for Simao Sabrosa, Rafa Benitez won't play ball. Speaking of BMWGTs, Alan Pardew has taken \u00a35m from the West Ham piggy bank and offered it to Red Star Belgrade for their 6' 7\" striker Nikola Zigic. And Cardiff will replace returning Leeds loanee Michael Ricketts with Darlington striker Guylain Ndumbu-Nsungu. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Atletico Madrid could be forced to postpone their weekend La Liga clash with Valencia after 14 players were struck down with acute gastroenteritis. \"We are falling one by one,\" wailed midfielder Gabi in between dashes to the bog. TV 'personality' Ian Wright has apologised to Sven-Goran Eriksson after claiming the Swede's main interest was \"sh*****g women at the FA\" and that he had \"as much passion as a tadpole\". The final manager of the month gongs for 2005 have been dished out, with Nigel Worthington (Norwich), Ronnie Moore (Oldham), and Paul Simpson (Carlisle) claiming the divisional prizes. And last, but not least; the link to the 'Save Our Silkmen' pixsale page in yesterday's David Conn column was incorrect.

We only won Big Cup five times after all.
