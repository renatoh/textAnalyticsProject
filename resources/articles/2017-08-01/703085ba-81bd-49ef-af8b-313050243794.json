So-called \u201cvirtual visits\u201d should be offered to inmates whose relatives are unable to attend jail because of illness, distance or other factors, according to the report. It suggests Skype calls to encourage face-to-face contact for prisoners, including foreign nationals or the parents of young babies, as part of proposals to prevent reoffending. Lord Farmer was commissioned last year to examine the importance of strengthening family ties in relation to reoffending rates. The peer found strong family relationships to be fundamental to change and \u201cindispensable\u201d for delivering the government\u2019s plans for prison reform in England and Wales. The prison system has seen levels of violence and self-harm surge as well as an increasing number of attacks on staff. Last month riots broke out at jails in Hertfordshire, Wiltshire and Worcestershire. Research indicates that reoffending rates are 39% lower among prisoners who receive visits from a partner or relative compared to those inmates who did not have family contact. The Farmer review found that while there are areas of good practice, there is \u201cunacceptable inconsistency\u201d on the issue of family links. It recommends that \u201cvirtual visits\u201d would be appropriate for a small percentage of the prison population with relatives who cannot visit them regularly or at all. \u201cThis would most likely include most foreign nationals, but also, for example, it might also be too disruptive for new babies, young children or teenagers studying for important exams to come into prison to visit at frequent intervals \u2013 but virtual visits would keep up the contact in the meantime,\u201d the review found. The blueprint cites a facility in Northern Ireland where prisoners have been making personal video calls. The initiative would ensure that those inside \u201cdo not become stuck in a technological dark age which will ill-equip them for life on the outside\u201d. Relatives should be able to call the prisons from their own homes without incurring any extra charges and should be given help with the technology if required, according to the report. Lord Farmer\u2019s findings also show that there is \u201clittle respect\u201d for family ties when prisoner locations are determined. He warns that the role of family work is \u201cunder-recognised\u201d in current policy and recommends that governors be held to account for family work outcomes. The peer said: \u201cMy report is not sentimental about prisoners\u2019 families, as if they can, simply by their presence, alchemise a disposition to commit crime into one that is law-abiding. \u201cHowever, I do want to hammer home a very simple principle of reform that needs to be a golden thread running through the prison system and the agencies that surround it. That principle is that relationships are fundamentally important if people are to change.\u201d The Ministry of Justice said it has already started developing a strategy for taking forward the review\u2019s recommendations. The justice secretary, David Lidington, said the government was committed to transforming prisons into places of safety and recognised the need to provide inmates with opportunities to change their behaviour. He said there were numerous examples of good practice, adding: \u201cWe will continue work on a strategy to best support offender needs. That has to start with the numbers of prison officers available to support offenders, which is why we are increasing staffing numbers by 2,500.\u201d Data released last month showed there were 26,643 assaults in prisons in the year to March, including a record 7,159 attacks on staff, an average of 20 a day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
