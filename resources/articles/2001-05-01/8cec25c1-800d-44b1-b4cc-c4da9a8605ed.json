A campaign to change the look of England's residential streets has received a major boost in the form of a \u00a330m government grant. Under the initiative local authorities will be able to bid for funds to transform streets into \"home zones\", specially designed areas shaped by the needs of people rather than traffic. The new money is part of a plan to tackle urban decay, announced by Prime Minister Tony Blair last month. The move has been welcomed by the home zone movement, a coalition of environmentalists and children's play campaigners, which has been arguing to end the dominance of the car and improve Britain's streets for residents. At their most basic, home zones are areas where pedestrians take priority over cars and traffic-calming measures discourage speeding and aggressive driving. While Britain may be just getting to grips with home zones, in mainland Europe they are almost old hat. In the Netherlands home zones - called Woonerfs - have been in operation for more than 30 years. There are now more than 6,500. At the heart of the home zone philosophy is the push to reclaim the streets for residents. Tim Gill, director of the Children's Play Council and a leading home zones supporter says their introduction has benefited all residents, not just the young. In addition they can foster greater community spirit. The campaign for UK home zones began four years ago but a change in traffic laws, implemented in February, was needed before they could take off. Ministers have given the green light to nine pilot projects in England and Wales and four in Scotland. Government money is funding the monitoring exercise but local authorities are stumping up the cash for the pilots themselves. In the home zone, speed limits are low - ideally no more than 10 mph. The change of status is underlined by the fact that drivers are automatically responsible for any injury they cause walkers or cyclists. A distinctive blue and white sign marking the boundary will greet anyone entering a home zone in Europe. Traffic calming measures, street furniture, and plants complete the picture. In some cases parking bays will be provided to free up street space. In a corner of West Ealing residents are preparing to have their environment transformed. After campaigning hard to become a pilot home zone, local residents' association the Five Roads Forum received the go ahead at the start of the year. The proposed changes include parking spaces, planting, decorative paving and a notice board. Six mosaics, created with the help of a local artist will be placed at the entrance of the streets to signal the new boundaries. Drivers coming in to the area will also notice that the road surface changes at the beginning of the zone. Householders began their campaign after finding their roads were being increasingly used for all-day parking by non-residents and as a cut through to avoid sitting at the main junction with Uxbridge Road. The rise in traffic was making the streets a no-go area for children - a problem because there are few green spaces nearby. Five Roads Forum spokeswoman Kim Tompsett says the first step for householders interested in converting their area into a home zone is to foster community spirit. In Ealing this was achieved with street parties, cricket matches and other community events. Ms Tompsett says they have achieved some of their targets. But initial plans to build a continental-style home zone where children are encouraged to use the street, met with resistance. \"We did hope to put benches and play furniture in the street. But not everyone wants to see children playing outside, some are concerned about damage to cars and property,\" she explains. In Manchester, the Northmoor estate is the largest of the pilot schemes proposed. The plan is to create a 20mph zone and home zones within the area. Drastic surgery is needed before the new landscape can emerge. This includes the demolition of some houses to provide pedestrian links and create courtyards for play and social activities. The Children's Play Council has commissioned research into the pilot projects to learn what makes a home zone work in the UK. Initial findings suggest that anyone planning a home zone should not underestimate how strongly residents feel about the look of their neighbourhood, says Mr Gill. \"Locals have strong, often conflicting views. And because of this people need to take time to build a community understanding and ownership of the home zone project,\" he says. Residents also have to be prepared to work hard at building a constructive relationship with their council. Ms Tompsett agrees. If you're unfamiliar with how local politics works you need to be ready to embark on a steep learning curve, she says. There is plenty of support available for would-be home zones, especially on the internet. The Children's Play Council will soon have a home zone website up and running. Details of how local authorities can bid for a share of the new money to fund home zones will be announced shortly - the current pilots are due to be completed by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the Ealing residents await the arrival of the diggers. As Ms Tompsett says, only then will they believe they have succeeded in reclaiming their streets. www.homezonenews.org.uk www.homezones.org"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
