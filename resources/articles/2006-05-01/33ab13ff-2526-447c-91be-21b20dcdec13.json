While understanding his reasons for saying this, I would argue that the most challenging task of all is to promote our national identity - Brand UK, if you like - to the world. In the old days, this kind of task might have fallen to the Ministry of Information, or some such government department, who would produce pamphlets and posters to celebrate all that was great about being British. Then, in the 60s, some bright spark dreamt up an advertising slogan called I'm Backing Britain. Perhaps it was meant to be ironic because it coincided with the closing down of the bulk of our major manufacturing industries. In the 90s, we had Cool Britannia, invented by Tony Blair's PR team who tried to make theirs the party of young, creative people. And today we live with the residue of this propaganda. The most obvious ambassadors of our national interests abroad are still sports stars and musicians, film-makers and writers. This strategy of using entertainment to flog national identity was piloted in Hollywood as a means of marketing the American dream to people who liked watching TV and films. The UK has mimicked this, building British entertainment brands - James Bond, Harry Potter, the Beatles and others - whether we like what they stand for or not. The problem is that it is superficial and misleading. The multicultural medley of modern urban life in the UK is brushed under the carpet. Tourists fly into Heathrow and expect to find a nation of Hugh Grants waiting for them. So who is best-placed to tackle the job of selling the UK's image around the world? The Government is unwilling to do anything about it at present, though you get the sense that David Cameron, along with his friend Matthew Freud, might have a go if they could. The trickiest part of the job would be to capture the genuine essence of Brand UK so that it could be packaged and marketed. To do this, we would need to agree a set of national brand values. But this is more difficult than it looks. Many of the old ideas - tolerance, fair play, modesty - don't seem to fit any more, while many of our new traits - cynicism, decadence, self-interest - aren't the sort of things we would want to shout about. To avoid being controversial, let's pick a national pastime that can bring a community together, such as gardening and our love of the great outdoors. Most Britons care about the environment a bit. Amplify this idea, pitch it up and imagine our rural affairs being run by the National Trust or English Heritage. Sign up Alan Titchmarsh and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall as international ambassadors. Let Britain be the nation to save the planet from carbon emissions. In the late 19th century, our country was a serious global power. Good public relations led to philanthropic pursuits and buildings that benefited local communities. Today, the legacy of Victorian generosity of spirit survives in primary schools, care homes and libraries in most major cities and towns. It would be nice to think that this concern for the welfare of others was something we could use in the 21st century to improve our image. Unfortunately, today's power brokers - corporations, brands, entrepreneurs and media owners - are prone to be mean-spirited and obsessed with profit and loss. It would be an unlikely, though welcome, transformation if they invested in the greater good above and beyond their own commercial interests. Perhaps the idea of a single PR campaign to unify our national image is, after all, mission impossible. Unless, of course, on July 9, possibly with the help of a short-sighted referee and with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales following Gordon Brown's example of cheering on \"the auld enemy\", England's football team manage to lift the World Cup in Germany and dedicate it to all of us in the UK. Then, and only then, anyone who thinks themselves British will sob for joy, wave the flag of victory and declare unconditional love for the place we all call home. \u00b7 Julian Henry is a director of Henry's House PR consultancy. julian@henryshouse.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
