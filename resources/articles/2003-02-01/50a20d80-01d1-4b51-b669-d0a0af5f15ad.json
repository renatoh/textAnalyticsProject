It represents a rare failure for the famously astute Ecclestone, who had hoped to revive flagging interest in F1 by allowing ITV1 and other terrestrial stations around the world to use his superior digital system in which he invested many millions. He developed the system, which needs two jumbo jets to lug it from race to race, hoping it would prove a money-spinner as a pay-per-view service. But this didn't work out and so Ecclestone planned to sell the service to ITV1 and other mass- audience broadcasters. He reasoned this would have the dual effect of recouping some of his investment and making terrestrial coverage more exciting. But while the broadcasters were keen, the money they were able to pay came nowhere near meeting Ecclestone's costs. The result is that Ecclestone has had to mothball many tons of extremely expensive hardware. Despite this, ITV1 viewers may, in fact, enjoy improved coverage because the producers of the terrestrial feed will no longer be limited by the constraints placed on them by Ecclestone when he was trying to establish his digital operation. The F1 season starts in three weeks in Melbourne. Ron Atkinson, phrase-maker extraordinaire - but did he really describe Liberia's George Weah as 'the big Librarian'? - will be given a double airing as ITV1 take the gamble of showing Champions League matches in prime time on successive nights this week. Peter Drury will commentate on Tuesday's Arsenal v Ajax match and Clive Tyldesley will talk us through Manchester United v Juventus on Wednesday. There will be no rest, though, for Atkinson, a star turn who helps to make ITV's Champions League coverage as popular as it is. He may even be part of the reason the channel have decided to risk clearing the schedules on two midweek evenings with the hope of attracting a combined audience of 15 million. One thing is certain: the decision will not have been taken lightly. ITV have not always fared well with prime-time football. The experiment of showing The Premiership in the Blind Date slot on Saturdays when it launched in 2001 was a disaster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
