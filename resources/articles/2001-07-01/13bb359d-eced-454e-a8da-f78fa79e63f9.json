That visceral piece, Clinamen/Nodus, suggested Neuwirth was a composer to follow; since then, though, there have been precious few opportunities to hear more of her work. On Thursday, however, the top Austrian new-music group Klangforum Wien, conducted by Sebastian Gottschick, brought The Long Rain to the Almeida, which offered another perspective on her work. Neuwirth studied film as well as composition and musical theory, and those interests come together in this multimedia work, based on a short story by Ray Bradbury. A spacecraft crash-lands on an alien planet that is subject to constant rain, and the crew struggle to find one of the solar domes that have been built as shelter from the deluge. The gradual psychological disintegration of the four men is graphically depicted in a film by Michael Kreihsl that forms the cinematic counterpoint to Neuwirth's work. Shot from different perspectives and projected onto three screens, the film shows the men's progress with minimum dialogue, until finally just one of them manages to reach the haven of the dome. Visuals and music were designed to be symbiotic - the trumpeter from the ensemble, for instance, makes a series of enigmatic appearances on screen, and the dome, when the survivor reaches it, contains the members of Klangforum Wien, presumably rehearsing the score. The ensemble of 25 players is arrayed around the hall to enclose the audience, with four soloists - bass flute, bass clarinet, tuba and saxophone - separating the groups of musicians. All of them are constantly subject to real-time electronic transformations and sound projections, and their playing is dovetailed with the prerecorded music that is part of the film's soundtrack. It is a complex arrangement, with perspectives constantly changing. Stylistically, though, the invention owes more to later Boulez than anything else: the world of R\u00e9pons and... explosante-fixe... are evoked in the rippling tuned percussion and the way in which sounds are transformed and rotated around the hall. There are also unexpected echoes of jazz at the end, with muted bluesy trumpets. It's never illustrative, but it does evoke the feelings of claustrophobia and oppression that the Bradbury story explores. Neuwirth's music might seem over-stretched if it were separated from the film, but that isn't the point. The Long Rain is a worthwhile experiment in combining the two media.
