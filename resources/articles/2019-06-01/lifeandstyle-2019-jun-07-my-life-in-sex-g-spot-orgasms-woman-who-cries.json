In my experience, that is spot on. G-spot orgasms have such a lasting effect on me that I cry when they happen. Every time. It first happened two years ago. I was having sex with my boyfriend in the doggy position and something suddenly felt different \u2013 as if a more internal sensation was being stimulated. My insides felt like the roof of my mouth, but warmer and spongier. Suddenly, tears started rolling down my face. Since then, this experience has been repeated while I was on top while leaning back and also while we were in a modified missionary position, with my legs over his shoulders. At first, I was embarrassed to the point where I would snap myself out of it and wipe away my tears quickly, so I wouldn\u2019t make things awkward between us. However, the more it occurred, the more willing I was to let my emotions show and be upfront with my boyfriend about the sudden tearful outbursts. Luckily, he finds it funny. I\u2019m fine with being open about it because, when I cry during sex, it\u2019s not out of sadness or pain. These tears are my body\u2019s way of releasing the emotions induced from a place, not only of powerful pleasure, but out of deep connection with the sexual experience. \u2022 Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life.
