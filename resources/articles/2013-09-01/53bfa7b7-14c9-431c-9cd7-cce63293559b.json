They were apprehensive then about the report of an independent panel, chaired by the bishop of Liverpool, which had reviewed 450,000 documents held by the bodies responsible at Hillsborough. Instead, the panel's report, principally authored by Professor Phil Scraton of Queen's University Belfast, prompted a spectacular overturning of official and public perceptions of Hillsborough, and government and legal inaction. David Cameron apologised in the House of Commons for indefensible conduct by South Yorkshire police, whose statements were changed as part of an orchestrated effort to divert blame for the 96 deaths from the police's own failings, on to the supporters themselves. Three months later, on 19 December, the inquest, against whose conduct and ultimate verdict of accidental death the families had protested in vain for 22 years, was quashed in an hour and a half in the high court on the application of Dominic Grieve QC, the attorney-general. A new inquest, for which Lord Justice Goldring has been appointed the coroner, will now be held to determine how each of the 96 people died, with a jury to deliver a verdict. Goldring has insisted the inquest, at a place yet to be decided in the north-west, must start by 31 March. The same day the inquest was quashed, the home secretary, Theresa May, announced a new criminal investigation, headed by Jon Stoddart, the former chief constable of Durham police.The South Yorkshire and West Midlands police forces referred their own officers to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for the biggest ever investigation into alleged police misconduct, after more than two decades of insisting there was no misconduct to answer for and that Hillsborough had been properly dealt with. Meanwhile, the South Yorkshire police blame-shifting effort, which the panel showed was sanctioned by the then chief constable, Peter Wright, is being investigated by the IPCC for possible misconduct offences, perjury and perverting the course of justice. The original investigation for potential criminal offences arising out of Hillsborough conducted by West Midlands police, which produced no prosecutions, is now itself being investigated by the IPCC for a range of possible misconduct, including \"general concerns about inadequate investigation and failure in direction and control\". Lord Geoffrey Dear, the former West Midlands police chief constable, is himself now under IPCC investigation for possible misconduct relating to that Hillsborough investigation, as is the former assistant chief constable, Mervyn Jones, and three other unnamed officers. Jones more recently produced to the IPCC the 12 policy books in which the Hillsborough investigation had been documented, and the IPCC is now investigating why Jones, not the West Midlands police force itself, had the policy books in his possession. Sir Norman Bettison, who had for years stated he had nothing to do with any South Yorkshire police \"black propaganda\" operation after Hillsborough, as claimed in parliament by the Merseyside Labour MP Maria Eagle in 1998, resigned in October as chief constable of West Yorkshire police after Eagle made further claims about his involvement. Bettison is now under IPCC investigation for his conduct after Hillsborough when he was a chief inspector at South Yorkshire police, including, the IPCC said, any \"involvement in disseminating misleading information\". Besides the failues on the day of South Yorkshire police's operation, the panel's report highlighted, as did Lord Justice Taylor's official report in August 1989, multiple safety failures at Hillsborough, owned by Sheffield Wednesday football club, and a safety certificate, which the local authority was required to licence for its compliance with the Home Office guide to safety at sports grounds (the \"green guide\"), not updated since 1979. The Football Association, which commissioned Hillsborough as its chosen venue for an FA Cup semi-final to which 54,000 paying supporters were invited, despite those safety breaches, the out of date safety certificate, and previous crushes at Hillsborough semi-finals in 1981, 1987 and 1988, is also under criminal investigation. A remarkable year on, families and survivors remain nevertheless apprehensive, nervous that even these huge investigations could yet produce nothing. But such understandable fears about the pace and quality of the investigations are, at least, for a justice process that many, although they fought relentlessly for it, never believed they would actually see."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
