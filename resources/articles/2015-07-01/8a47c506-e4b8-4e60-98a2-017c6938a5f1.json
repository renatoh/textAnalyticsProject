For episode three, click here By now, regular viewers of Humans might think they have a good idea of who\u2019s a human, who\u2019s a synth, who\u2019s a hybrid and who you should never mess with. And Hobb does, too, as he interrogates Silas, who isn\u2019t much use except when he reveals that Leo \u201cbled blood\u201d. So now the search is on for four synths and a human. \u2018I would like some time apart\u2019 Pete is on gardening leave for battering a pesky journalist, which frees him up to become the third wheel in Simon and Jill\u2019s intimate breakfast. It\u2019s no surprise, then, when Jill gives him The Talk. \u201cI don\u2019t think you make me happy any more,\u201d she deadpans. \u201cI don\u2019t think this relationship is healthy for me any more and I would like some time apart.\u201d Hang on, that was a cold and almost synth-like delivery. Surely she\u2019s not one of them, is she? If it wasn\u2019t for the deposit, Pete would batter Simon the synth too. \u201cI\u2019m an analogue man in a digital world,\u201d he laments as he sleeps in the office. \u201cI\u2019m redundant.\u201d The fact that a synth has murdered someone is, quite rightly, bothering him. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s not an isolated incident?\u201d he asks Karen. \u201cIf there are more synths out there who can kill?\u201d she replies. \u201cWell, we\u2019re all screwed then, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Karen goes to bed and removes a blue plastic bag from her mouth. It\u2019s filled with tonight\u2019s dinner and the red wine she\u2019s been quaffing. Right, so she\u2019s a synth too. \u2018You don\u2019t know how this feels\u2019 Ah, Joe, with your beardy hangdog face full of sadness and longing, what will you do when you\u2019re left alone in the house with Anita? With the kids all out at parties and Laura off seeing a client, Joe is pouring the wine, while Anita is doing the washing. Uh-oh, the conditions are ripe for some lively human-synth interaction. \u201cSometimes I wish my family came with instructions,\u201d he says. \u201cCan you feel awkwardness? Just as well.\u201d And before you know it he\u2019s fingering the Adult Options booklet. Maybe he should try it \u201cjust out of curiosity\u201d. A few passwords and some nervous chat later and there\u2019s an illicit kiss, which leads to the inevitable synth-tercourse. And afterwards? Imagine the moment after the world\u2019s worst one-night stand and multiply it by all the awkwardness you can muster. Anita heads off to \u201cclean up\u201d. And we\u2019re not talking about the oven here. \u2018Standard party activity\u2019 In other depressing synth-based sexual politics news, Mattie and Toby are at a party and it\u2019s not just the cider hidden in the tumble dryer that\u2019s a rule-breaker. Two teenage boys have put the family synth into sleep mode and are taking her upstairs. \u201cI\u2019m having a go on her,\u201d says one. Mattie steps in. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s normal to drag an unconscious woman into a room and rape her? Is that standard party activity?\u201d \u2018She\u2019s just a machine that\u2019s malfunctioning.\u2019 So Joe\u2019s in bed with his guilt lying heavy as Laura returns home. The fact that Anita can feel fear is playing on Laura\u2019s mind and she insists on getting her diagnostics checked. It\u2019s surprising news: Anita is not brand new \u2013 she is at least 14 years old. Joe tries to defend her weirdness. \u201cShe\u2019s just a machine that\u2019s malfunctioning, that\u2019s all,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s more than that,\u201d argues Laura. \u2018We still don\u2019t have their precise location\u2019 What of Leo\u2019s search for Mia? He arranges to meet Mattie after making contact online and he is expecting a \u201cgiant lumberjack stripper\u201d, so is surprised when a teenage girl turns up. Showing Mattie a photo of \u201cMia\u201d sends her legging it out through the toilets. A bit of research by Max leads them to Dr Millican\u2019s house, where it\u2019s revelations all round. Millican explains why he left the synth project: \u201cDavid was taking his research in a direction I wasn\u2019t comfortable with.\u201d And Leo reveals he\u2019s David\u2019s son. The one who died. \u2018It\u2019s human v synth\u2019 Niska is still on the loose and, as luck would have it, she\u2019s come up against a synth-hater, who hands her a flyer for tonight\u2019s underground synth-jousting event at the local smash club. Metal bar in hand, she takes her turn, but attacks the humans instead. Leo needs her to get out of there alive: he has discovered the programme his dad used to give synths like him and Niska consciousness. So she drills a policeman to the wall and walks off into the night\u2026 Notes and queries Having an existential crisis? No need. Humans can live on as synths, thanks to Elster\u2019s programme. But would you want to? If synths are killing and competing against humans at the smash club, how long until war is declared? Ones to watch: police officer Karen, who\u2019s faking synth-dom and Jill \u2013 something\u2019s not right there. Teenagers don\u2019t come out of this well, do they? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Laura, I don\u2019t understand the question\u201d: Anita\u2019s catchphrase is becoming more amusing every week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
