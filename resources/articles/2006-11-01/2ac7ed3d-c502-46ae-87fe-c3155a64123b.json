They hadn't tasted fresh meat for six months and so the island they stumbled on, teeming as it was with practically tame kangaroos, was a godsend. On the first day he and his men clubbed to death 31 animals, which they boiled into a huge soup, stewed or sliced into steaks. Flinders then sat down and wrote up his diary: 'In gratitude for so seasonable a supply, I named this south land Kangaroo Island.' Today, the kangaroos of Kangaroo Island have only the motor car to contend with. Here they call the bull bars on the front of their 4x4s hopper stoppers. 'I was showing a French woman round the island once,' says Andrew 'Schoey' Schofield, our supremely knowledgeable guide from Adventure Charters. 'All she wanted to see was a kangaroo. I found some kangaroos and she was happy - it made her trip. Finally we had to drive back and as we turned a corner, blam! A kangaroo came out of nowhere. I killed it outright. The woman was in hysterics. She wouldn't speak to me again.' Kangaroo Island is a long sliver of bush-covered land a 30-minute light aircraft flight south of Adelaide. It's Australia's third largest island after Tasmania and Melville Island and is one of the best places to see the panoply of Aussie wildlife in its natural habitat. The island has two species of kangaroo, wallabies, koalas, possums, echidnas, platypuses, snakes and more than 250 different types of bird. It also happens to be home to some of the most chic lodges in Australia, with more planned deep in the rugged bush. So getting up close to the wildlife is a particularly luxurious and pleasurable experience. Still green-faced from the bumpy flight (what could we expect from Emu Airways, named after a flightless bird?), my girlfriend and I were whisked from the more populated east around the main town Kingscote towards the rugged western tip of the 90 mile-long island. Here sits Australia's largest National Park - named after Matthew Flinders, ironically perhaps - in which a host of distinctive animals are now protected. En route, we see koalas munching away merrily in gum trees and kangaroos bounding away over the fields. At Seal Bay, on the island's southern coast, we wandered down over the soft white dunes to where a colony of Australian sea lions were parked up on a windswept beach. These sea lions are some of the rarest in the world. They were once hunted for their blubber and now there are only 10,000 left. This colony supports more than 600. After our tour, Schoey returned us to Kingscote as hungry as Flinders. But it wasn't kangaroo steaks that were waiting for us. Kingscote is a tiny town with little more than a general store, a large mulberry tree planted by the first settlers and a couple of pubs. We asked Schoey where we should go for dinner. 'Well, the tourists tend to go to the Ozone Hotel on the front.' The food there is very good, but, wanting a more authentic experience, we visited the locals' pub. It was bare and the dining room had a whiff of the village hall about it. We didn't hold high hopes for the food. But when it arrived it was brilliant. Very fresh ingredients, well cooked with superb Aussie wine. The following day we moved on to Cliff House, a stunning Sixties-style clifftop residence overlooking Snelling Beach, our own - practically deserted - strip of sand. The house is one of three owned by descendants of the antipodean car making family Holden. Each is uniquely designed and utterly remarkable. Ours had a Brigitte Bardot/James Bond feel, which sat happily with us: lots of thick rugs, an open fire (it can be cold at night), picture windows and a telescope for stargazing. The fridge was fully stocked with champagne and the dining table held an incredible spread of oysters, lobster and yabbies (sweet freshwater crayfish). The other two houses are equally special. Sky House has a vague Mexican-influence with adobe-style walls and suntraps protected from the wind. As it's further up the hill behind the beach, the views are incredible. Stone House is the most traditional of the three, a former sheep-shearing house. Kate, who works for Lifetime Retreats and runs her own gallery and restaurant, Wind in the Wings, further up the hill came down to welcome us and explained that a pod of dolphins is regularly seen just off Snelling Beach, following shoals of salmon. If we were really lucky they might even come into the bay and if I was willing to brave the cold water of the Southern Ocean (Antarctica is the next stop south) I could go out and swim with them. I settled down to wait. The dolphins didn't come, but we went for a swim anyway. It was freezing, but fun, particularly as we tried to do backstroke while keeping one watchful eye on the waves for those telltale dorsal fins (dolphins or sharks). On our way back up the cliff path to the house we passed a group of fishermen on holiday from Melbourne. 'You guys from England?' one of them asked from inside his zipped-up jacket. 'How did you know?' I asked, standing in nothing but a towel and slowly turning blue. 'Just a guess, mate.' The following day I went to visit Kate's gallery. She has an ever-changing collection of rather good Aboriginal art, which only really begins to make any sense once you've been in the country for a while as it's entirely rooted in the connection between the animals and the landscape of Australia. 'Come and look at this, my pride and joy,' said Kate pointing to a small shoulder bag hooked over the back of a chair. I peered at the bag, not sure what was about to be produced. Then a long furry stick appeared attached to a baby kangaroo called Winger, who flopped out on to the floor and looked around dozily. When I got back to the house I took up my position by the telescope and there, yes, the glistening humps of dolphins playing in the bay. By the time I'd got to the beach and thrown myself into the water though they were out of the bay and away. That evening we were invited to dinner with Lady Holden in the old sheep-shearing shed. There, in what is now a sort of bohemian dining lair, we sat by an open fire and ate beautifully cooked lamb. I think, in his way, Flinders would have been proud of what has become of his island.
