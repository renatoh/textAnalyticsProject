City had made a subdued start to the Women\u2019s Super League season and endured some difficult periods at Wembley against a spirited Everton side. But Taylor said Everton \u201cdid not look especially dangerous\u201d and challenged his players to make history by becoming the first club to win the Cup twice in a season. \u201cWe controlled most of the game,\u201d said Taylor in a conference call following City\u2019s 3-1 extra-time victory. \u201cWe had to find some resolve. Once we stuck to the principles of keeping the ball, we knew we\u2019d arrive in the final third. We kept knocking on the door, and eventually it opened. The will imposed by the players as a collective was top-class.\u201d This was only Taylor\u2019s ninth game in charge of City after taking over from Nick Cushing in May, but he has been encouraged by the early signs of progress. \u201cThis can be a springboard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to achieve big things, we want to make history, and challenge the club to do what may never be done again, which is win the FA Cup twice in one season.\u201d The 2019-20 competition was carried over into this season because of the pandemic. Everton\u2019s manager, Willie Kirk, was disappointed but proud of his players and promised that they would learn and improve from the experience. \u201cThe manner of that defeat only heightens your trust and reinforces your belief,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back here. The beauty of this group is that we\u2019re continually learning. We\u2019ve got something potentially really special here. We\u2019ll continue to improve, we\u2019ll continue to strengthen. We could have been a little bit better in the final third. But City deserved it.\u201d Both managers also paid particular tribute to the Everton goalkeeper Sandy MacIver, who was named player of the match for the multiple saves that kept her side in the contest. \u201cOutstanding from start to finish,\u201d said Kirk. \u201cFor me, she\u2019s England\u2019s No 1.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
