The prime minister blamed the deadlock on the IRA, which, he said, had failed to commit itself to abandon all paramilitary activities. The elections will now not happen on May 29, they have instead been pencilled in for the autumn, after Northern Ireland's marching season. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams condemned the decision and called for protest demonstrations on May 29. He said Sinn Fein would have to \"review\" where the delay leaves the peace process. \"Rather than today moving the peace process forward it has in many ways compounded the difficulties,\" he said of today's decision. Along with today's announcement, the British and Irish government have published their joint declaration on completing the implementation of the Good Friday agreement. It details the paramilitary activities the IRA must abandon for Sinn Fein to re-enter government. Of these, Mr Blair said: \"There is lack of clarity whether the IRA is prepared for a full, immediate and permanent cessation of all paramilitary activity - including military attacks, training, targeting, intelligence gathering, acquisition or development of arms or weapons, other preparations for terrorist campaigns, punishment beatings and attacks and involvement in riots.\" He also dismissed Mr Adams's insistence yesterday that \"the IRA leadership is determined that there will be no activities which will undermine in any way the peace process and the Good Friday agreement\". Mr Blair described it as a \"general assurance\", but added that \"there was a point blank refusal to rule out expressly the activities stated in paragraph 13 of the joint declaration.\" And he asked: \"Will those activities continue to be authorised or not by the IRA? Yes or no? It is not a desperately complicated situation. But it is one that requires a very clear answer.\" Mr Blair said that without one, the trust necessary to restore the institutions could not be built. He added that the issue could not be resolved during an election campaign. \"If we have the election now, without agreement, we will simply make an eventual agreement less likely.\" Mr Blair also called on the IRA to published the statement it passed to the British and Irish government. He said that the governments were publishing their joint declaration to \"show people what was on offer\". He promised to push on with delivering as much of the declaration as both governments could. The Irish taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, who is due to meet Mr Blair next Tuesday, said he disagreed with the government's decision. \"Ultimately, I believe that yet another postponement causes more problems for the process than it solves,\" he told reporters. All Northern Ireland's parties, with the exception of the Ulster Unionists (UUP), have also opposed another poll delay. Elections were originally postponed from May 1. It is understood that the UUP leader, David Trimble, had urged another postponement when he met Tony Blair yesterday. It is believed that Mr Trimble and the government had feared that the UUP could be replaced by the anti-Good Friday agreement Democratic Unionist party (DUP) as Northern Ireland's biggest unionist party if the elections had took place without a further concessions by the IRA. Today Mr Trimble welcomed the government's decision. \"The underlying problem that caused the suspension has to be resolved,\" he said. \"It has not been possible to do so and of course, to proceed to elect to a body that has no prospect of meeting is illogical.\" Republicans and nationalists reacted with anger to the news of another postponement. Earlier today Sinn Fein's Bairbre de Bruin said: \"I think it's absolutely scandalous that the goalposts are yet again being moved. The question is not one of any suggestion around words. The British government asked for words. They got those words. They've now moved the goalposts again.\" \"The people should decide. The election campaign has begun. The elections should not be cancelled, and any British government that is now going to cancel elections in Ireland is cancelling democracy in Ireland.\" SDLP leader Mark Durkan also claimed it would add to the instability of the province's devolved institutions. The DUP was also critical of the decision. Its deputy leader, Peter Robinson, claimed: \"It is clear the prime minister has caved in to the political cowardice of David Trimble. He is prepared to play fast and loose with the democratic process to prop up a leader who will be unable to deliver anything.\" The Northern Ireland assembly was suspended last year following allegations of an IRA spy-ring in Stormont."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
