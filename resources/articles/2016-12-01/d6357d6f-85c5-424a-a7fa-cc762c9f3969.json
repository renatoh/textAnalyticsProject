But this year\u2019s event \u2013 now called simply the fashion awards, the \u201cBritish\u201d bit dropped \u2013 was also the inaugural fundraising gala for the British Fashion Council\u2019s Education Foundation charity, which provides scholarships for students to design, and supports apprenticeships. \u00a310m is expected to be raised in the next 10 years. Worthy cause in place, the fashion industry did what it does best \u2013 celebrating itself. The big hitters of 2016 were rewarded: Alexander McQueen was named British brand of the year and Vogue received a special recognition award for its centenary year. But, in keeping with the awards\u2019 new cause, it was youth that dominated. This was evident in the case of Jaden and Willow Smith, 18 and 16 respectively, the winners of the new fashion icons award. The 21-year-old Gigi Hadid, up against her sister, Bella, was rightly crowned international model, as her 26.2 million Instagram followers would no doubt attest. The design awards felt like they were focusing on youth and zeitgeist too. Craig Green and Simone Rocha \u2013 both 30 \u2013 won the British menswear and womenswear awards, which traditionally have gone to more established brands. The loudest voices in the current fashion conversation were also acknowledged. The reworked, newly fashionable Gucci won two awards \u2013 international accessories designer for its creative director, Alessandro Michele, and international business leader, an award introduced this year, for its chief executive, Marco Bizzarri. Demna Gvasalia, fashion disruptor du jour, was named international ready-to-wear designer for his work for Balenciaga. Vetements, the Paris-based collective where he is head designer, was the recipient of another new award, international urban luxury brand, which has been introduced to address growth of sportswear in fashion. It was somewhat incongruously presented by corset and makeup fan Marilyn Manson. Gvasalia, on message as ever, was in a GAP baseball cap. The fashion awards emphasised the international in a post-Brexit-vote world \u2013 as ditching the \u201cBritish\u201d in the awards\u2019 title seems to suggest. Two US giants received hefty awards. Photographer Bruce Weber, who has been taking pictures that define American style for five decades, won the Isabella Blow award for fashion creator. Designer Ralph Lauren, a regular Weber collaborator with an equal talent for American style, received the outstanding achievement award, perhaps in mind of 2017 marking 50 years of his brand. Natalie Massenet, who chairs the British Fashion Council , described Weber as \u201cone of the foremost photographers and creative talents of our age\u201d, and praised 77-year-old Lauren\u2019s \u201coutstanding legacy\u201d. Lauren\u2019s award was presented by another global brand name, David Beckham, who received a huge cheer from the audience. The fashion crowd, full of those who once reserved such enthusiasm only for one of their own, is learning that wider international recognition has its charms. The fashion industry is estimated to employ 880,000 people in Britain and generates \u00a328bn a year for the UK economy, so focus on the next generation makes sense. The awards coincided with the launch of a British fashion platform on Google\u2019s arts &amp; culture site. With content on Kate Moss\u2019s first ever show at London fashion week and the ability to zoom in on the embroidery on an Alexander McQueen dress, it is designed to make fashion accessible. \u201cWe hope this legacy project will not only inspire but also educate,\u201d said Caroline Rush, the chief executive of British Fashion Council."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
