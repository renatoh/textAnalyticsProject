The move comes after the Greens blamed outsourcing for the breach in the Business Information Services system which held expenses and credit-card information dating from 2004 to 2015. The opposition\u2019s social services spokeswoman, Jenny Macklin, and cybersecurity spokeswoman, Gai Brodtmann, said Labor was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the breach because the government had a responsibility to keep its employees\u2019 data safe. Compromised data included credit-card information, employees\u2019 names, user names, work phone numbers, work emails, system passwords, Australian government services numbers, public service classifications and organisation units. \u201cThe minister must now outline what is being done to investigate this breach, explain to staff exactly how their data was exposed, for how long and whether it is now safe, and confirm whether his department complies with the mandated cybersecurity standards,\u201d they said. \u201cIt\u2019s the government\u2019s responsibility to ensure the cyber-resilience of government agencies and this responsibility extends to the contractors that government agencies employ.\u201d In letters sent to alert staff, DSS blamed its third-party provider and said the breach was \u201cnot a result of any of the department\u2019s internal systems\u201d. The Greens social services spokeswoman, Rachel Siewert, said the breach \u201cdemonstrates the risks of outsourcing work on sensitive material to private contractors\u201d. \u201cThe federal government is continually looking to outsource and privatise department and Centrelink services, and here is another example of the associated risks,\u201d she said, citing a recent decision to use labour hire staff to recover welfare debts. \u201cHanding sensitive material to private contractors who do not have the same checks and balances means that breaches are more likely to occur.\u201d Porter said: \u201cThe government takes incidents like this very seriously and the department has worked rapidly to contain the issue.\u201d Business Information Services has had contracts in place with the department since 2007 under Labor. It services a number of government departments and \u201cit is standard practice to approach the market to procure these services\u201d, he said. \u201cI have requested a full investigation of the issue to determine how the breach occurred.\u201d The chairman of the Australian Privacy Foundation, David Vaile, said the department had not acknowledged that outsourcing functions to an external provider \u201crepresents an increased risk, and in this case it has come home to roost\u201d. Vaile said outsourcing was harmful \u201cfrom a governance perspective\u201d because \u201cyou can deny you\u2019re part of the problem, you think you\u2019ve contracted out of responsibility\u201d. A DSS spokesman said the breach, which was open from June 2016 until October 2017, was closed within hours after the Australian Signals Directorate notified the department. The department told staff there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of improper use of the data or of the department\u2019s credit cards. A spokeswoman for Business Information Services said that as a result of a \u201ccontrol vulnerability\u201d some historical information about employees\u2019 work expenses \u201cwas vulnerable to possible cyber-breach\u201d. \u201cThere is no evidence of a cyber-attack, only that it was possible,\u201d she said. The spokeswoman said the information included \u201cpartially anonymous work-related expenses\u201d including \u201ccost centres, corporate credit cards without CCV and expiry dates, and passwords that were hashed and therefore not visible\u201d. \u201cThe bulk of credit-card information within the data had expired.\u201d The BIS spokeswoman said the vulnerability was \u201csecured within four hours\u201d, the data was no longer publicly accessible and it had undertaken a security review. She said the vulnerability was \u201clabelled low-risk\u201d. But Vaile said the breach affected a \u201csignificant number\u201d and that employees\u2019 usernames, full names and system passwords were \u201cmaterial that could be quite useful for identity theft, fraud and masquerading\u201d, where an attacker pretends to be an authorised user."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
