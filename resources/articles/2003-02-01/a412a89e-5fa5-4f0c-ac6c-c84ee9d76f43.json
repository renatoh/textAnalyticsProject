The \u00a31.7m Dspace project, being developed in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the US, will provide a digital repository of academic information that could potentially be accessed by anyone with a Google search engine. Dspace@Cambridge will allow academics to pool resources, including theses, technical reports and archives, with formats ranging from databases to multimedia clips and teaching material. MIT launched a Dspace system in November. Six more US universities will use the software, which MIT Libraries developed over the past two years with Hewlett-Packard Laboratories. Peter Fox, the librarian who is leading the project in Cambridge, said Dspace had implications for the journal system, which he said was one of the biggest issues in the academic world at the moment. \"It means academics would have the option, if they so wished, to archive their own material, or could choose to do this before they put it in a scholarly journal.\" Dr Manfredi La Manna, reader in economics at St Andrew's University and director of the Electronic Society for Social Science, said Dspace was a good idea, but how useful it would be depended on how its potential was handled. \"The Dspace is like a useful but empty box, so it will only be as useful as the information in it. \"At the moment, a lot of academic material is only available in journals, which are very expensive to subscribe to. Ideally, Dspace could allow so much information to be shared worldwide, but there also needs to be an incentive for the system to be changed.\" Cambridge will receive \u00a3950,000 over two years from the Cambridge-MIT Institute to install Dspace. In a related initiative, also funded by the CMI, Cambridge University library and MIT libraries are organising a two-year programme of seminars to assist higher and further education institutions in the UK to develop plans for implementing their own digital institutional repositories."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
