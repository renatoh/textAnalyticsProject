They were the second biggest group in Britain by that point and rising fast in the US. But their popularity was based on covers of contemporary R&amp;B records and, in the case of their most recent UK No 1, Little Red Rooster, pure blues. Manager Andrew Oldham hustled Mick Jagger and Keith Richards to write their own songs and, after several false starts, The Last Time was the first one to be chosen for an A-side. It was a knock-off, of course, from This May Be the Last Time by the Staples Singers, but the Rolling Stones made the material their own. The meshing, droning guitars recede into ambient depth, while Mick Jagger's performance ranges from sadness and loss to \u2013 and this would become a trope \u2013 sheer vituperation. Released in February 1965, The Last Time quickly went to No 1 in the UK, promoted by Mick Jagger doing the James Brown slide on Top of the Pops. Attitudinal, preoccupied with sound, groove and tone, it was one of the cornerstones \u2013 along with the Beatles' Ticket To Ride \u2013 of the emergent rock aesthetic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
