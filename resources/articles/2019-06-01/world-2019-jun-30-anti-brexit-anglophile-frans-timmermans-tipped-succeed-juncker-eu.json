Frans Timmermans, a self-confessed anglophile who is fluent in seven languages, had appeared to be in pole position to take over from Juncker to head the European commission from 1 November as leaders met on Sunday evening. His candidacy had been given a boost over the weekend by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who said Timmermans, the Socialists\u2019 and Democrats\u2019 nominee for the post, or the German centre-right MEP Manfred Weber would be \u201cpart of the solution\u201d. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has opposed Weber\u2019s claim to the role as group leader of the European People\u2019s party (EPP), the largest group in the European parliament. Merkel agreed at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, that despite her support for Weber, he would not get the top job but would be given a senior role elsewhere, potentially as president of the European parliament. But Timmermans route to top job in the commission soon appeared in jeopardy, faced with opposition led by the Polish and Hungarian governments as leaders debated the issue at the summit. He has criticised both administrations for their record on protecting the independence of the judiciary. Poland\u2019s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, dismissed claims that Timmermans was the \u201ccandidate of compromise\u201d as he arrived at the summit of EU leaders in Brussels. \u201cFrans Timmermans is the candidate who is strongly dividing Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t understand central Europe, doesn\u2019t understand Europe, which is emerging now from the post-communist collapse.\u201d Should the four countries most likely to block Timmermans \u2013 Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia \u2013 be joined by Italy\u2019s populist government, it would leave the UK in effect with a casting vote, an awkward position given Theresa May\u2019s insistence that she will not meddle in the future leadership of the EU at what is expected to be her final summit as prime minister. But other leaders from Weber\u2019s centre-right EPP group, including the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, also spoke of their concerns about the centre-left candidate taking control, as Merkel\u2019s solution appeared to unravel. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s a lot opposition to the proposal that was made in Osaka from the EPP\u2019s point of view,\u201d Varadkar said. \u201cThe vast majority of the EPP prime ministers don\u2019t believe that we should give up the presidency of the commission quite so easily, without a fight.\u201d Plans for the 28 EU heads of state and government to make a decision on their preferred candidate as commission president, and for other roles including the presidencies of the European council and European Central Bank, by breakfast on Monday morning appeared doomed to fail with another summit on the issue in mid-July looking increasingly likely. A working dinner on Sunday of pea soup, fillets of sole and a dark chocolate dessert was hours late in starting and had to be suspended midway to allow further bilateral talks to take place in a clear sign of the difficulties. It had been hoped that the leaders\u2019 nomination for commission president would be voted on by the European parliament in the coming days. Whoever replaces Juncker will be in post after 31 October by which time Johnson, the frontrunner for the Tory leadership, has said the UK will leave with or without a deal. A former Dutch foreign minister who is currently one of Juncker\u2019s deputies with responsibility for rule of law issues, Timmermans, 58, is a longstanding critic of Johnson. He criticised him after the EU referendum for equating the actions of the EU to Adolf Hitler\u2019s attempts to unify Europe, and describing Barack Obama as \u201cthe part-Kenyan president\u201d who harboured an \u201cancestral dislike of the British empire\u201d. \u201cWould it not have been enough to say that you disagree with the American president\u2019s point of view?\u201d Timmermans wrote in a blog the day after the referendum. \u201cWhy discredit not just his motives, but even his persona, with borderline racist remarks?\u201d He went on: \u201cTo accuse people who believe in [the EU] of trying to finish where Hitler left off is, to say the least, a bit rich. How did hatred become an integral part of all this? Why is it necessary?\u201d Since the referendum, Timmermans has repeatedly suggested the British public might wish to \u201crethink\u201d the decision to leave the EU while accepting the legitimacy of the 2016 vote, targeting Johnson for criticism. \u201cHas Boris Johnson gone to the doctors and nurses of the NHS and said: \u2018I did promise you \u00a3350m extra a week; sorry, I can\u2019t deliver on that promise\u2019?\u201d Timmermans said in a speech to the European parliament in March. Timmermans\u2019s energetic campaigning as the lead candidate, or Spitzenkandidat, of the Socialists and Democrats during the European elections was seen as having played a key role in the resurgence of the Dutch Labour party, of which he is a member. Under the Spitzenkandidaten system, first used in 2014 for Juncker\u2019s appointment, the election results are expected to be decisive in terms of the political orientation of the president of the commission. While the EPP remained as the biggest group after the elections, it had emerged weaker than before and the Socialists and Democrats came in a relatively close second ahead of the strengthened liberal and green political groups. Timmermans, the son of a diplomat, has in recent years championed green causes including a \u201cwar on plastic\u201d, sparring with the British environment secretary, Michael Gove, on the issue on social media. He has also been mentioned recently by Macron, whose La R\u00e9publique En Marche party is part of the liberal Renew Europe group in the parliament, as a strong and acceptable candidate for commission president."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
