And then, once a generation, a performance stands the test of time, its memory handed down in cultural folklore: Sarah Siddons as Lady Macbeth, Laurence Olivier as Archie Rice in The Entertainer, or Mark Rylance in Jerusalem. This spring many theatrical pundits agree the name of Denise Gough can be etched up there with the best of them. Last Sunday her harrowing, bravura portrayal of an addict named Emma in Duncan MacMillan\u2019s new play People, Places, Things earned her an Olivier award for best actress. The next night, clearly elated, she brought the trophy on to the stage of Wyndham\u2019s Theatre for her curtain call. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really going to bring the award out, but I am really proud of the audience for this show. They are the final element,\u201d Gough told the Observer this weekend. \u201cEmma lives every night because people are coming to see it. It is quite an intense thing to sit through. I can hear people reacting. So at the end I wanted to say, I am all right. You are all right.\u201d But what makes an acting performance qualify as a tour de force? And is it a mixed blessing to be so closely associated with one towering role? \u201cI don\u2019t care what people call it,\u201d said Gough. \u201cThat is not my business. I have been doing this role since last year and the play means more to me than normal, because of the people I have met and the people it might be helping. When people write things about the production, that is not me. I am just doing my job. It is only that people are now seeing it. It is all technique and years of experience, not magic.\u201d Yet a stage performance that unites the critics \u2013 all writers with different readerships who often delight in disagreeing with each other \u2013 is an uncanny thing. Most would agree an acting tour de force cannot be pulled off in a bad play, but equally a particular performance can cast a long shadow over a fine work. It will be a while, surely, before another actor puts on Rooster Byron\u2019s white vest to play Jez Butterworth\u2019s leading character in Jerusalem on a London stage. The sound of Rylance closing the show with a banging drum still reverberates. \u201cActually I don\u2019t think tour de force should be routinely used as a word of praise,\u201d said the Observer critic Susannah Clapp. \u201cRylance gave an extraordinary performance in a good play, but sometimes a tour de force can just be a \u2018turn\u2019 \u2013 and when someone is obtrusive, it is not so great for the other actors in a show.\u201d Like Rylance, Clapp believes, Gough has given audiences something better than a \u201cturn\u201d. \u201cShe is one of the best actresses around, but \u2018tour de force\u2019 can imply effort rather than quality. And Gough is such a brilliant, self-disguised actress that although I have followed her career I have often had to look her up in the cast list because I haven\u2019t recognised her in a part.\u201d Clapp is thrilled to see Gough receiving recognition and adds that, while MacMillan\u2019s play is strong, \u201cher performance is the reason for going to it\u201d. In such a play, a towering central performance can be required for the piece to function at all. In other classic works, say Sophocles\u2019 Electra, the central role is a chance for a showcase that has been grabbed by actresses including Zo\u00eb Wanamaker (1998) and Fiona Shaw (1988), all the way back to Peggy Ashcroft in 1951. Similarly, Styne and Sondheim\u2019s musical Gypsy is a perfect vehicle for anyone woman enough to take on Mama Rose, from Ethel Merman, to Angela Lansbury in 1973, and now Imelda Staunton in the Chichester production that took the West End by storm. Certainly Staunton\u2019s \u201ctour de force\u201d was an inspiration for Gough, who contacted the actress for advice. \u201cGypsy wouldn\u2019t normally be my kind of show,\u201d said Gough. \u201cBut it was great. Imelda only missed something like three shows in eight months. That is why I had to talk to her. That was the one.\u201d The physical demands on both actresses have been marked. \u201cI have to sleep as much as I can,\u201d said Gough, \u201calthough I am finding sleep hard because my adrenal glands are going at 90mph. And I didn\u2019t sleep well last night but I have to be kind to myself. \u201cHopefully next week I can go back to my yoga. Imelda suggested I see a physio, and that has been brilliant. I know I shouldn\u2019t be doing anything athletic, I need to save that for the stage. Anything I am doing should be about relaxation. To be honest, I can manage one show, but days with two shows are a killer. I have to go straight to bed and meditate to get over it.\u201d When it comes to the history of musical barnstormers, Clapp puts Glenn Close\u2019s performance as Norma Desmond in Lloyd Webber\u2019s Sunset Boulevard near the top of her list, but she also salutes her great favourite, Eileen Atkins, in a one-woman show as Ellen Terry in which she \u201cgraciously\u201d switched from playing Cordelia to Lear in one scene: \u201cShe acts everybody off the stage by not acting. She is almost the reverse of a tour de force.\u201d A remarkable performance from Ralph Fiennes in George Bernard Shaw\u2019s Man and Superman wins Clapp\u2019s accolade for an actor: \u201cThe part is most extraordinary. I happen to know he had wanted to do it for a long while, and it was a feat of memory.\u201d Critics often genuflect at the mention of Derek Jacobi\u2019s Cyrano in 1983, while in 2007 Anne Marie Duff cemented her reputation with a fiery St Joan at the National Theatre. The actor Simon Callow was bowled over by Jonathan Pryce\u2019s \u201cvery Celtic Hamlet\u201d in 1980, he said this weekend. \u201cHe played Hamlet\u2019s father too, as a vision rather than a ghost. That was quite sensational.\u201d To justify being hailed as a tour de force, the performer ought to spend a lot of time on view. For those who remember seeing Glenda Jackson in 1964 as the inmate Charlotte Corday in Peter Weiss\u2019s gruelling play Marat/Sade, the experience was gripping. Similarly, Judi Dench put in the hours on stage as Mother Courage at the Barbican in 1984 while Vanessa Redgrave won raves as Lady Torrance in Orpheus Descending in 1989. When a playwright such as Samuel Beckett throws down the gauntlet, an actor has no alternative but to show endurance; first Billie Whitelaw, and now Lisa Dwan, have risen to that challenge. Occasionally it works the other way around and a play is created as a showcase for a talent. In Peter Morgan\u2019s The Audience, his play about the Queen\u2019s interactions with successive prime ministers, Helen Mirren was scarcely off-stage and her transformations were the heart of the action. Finally, of course, a major performance can be met with a standing ovation because it is the happy ending of a traditional theatrical fairy story: that moment when an understudy steps into the limelight at the last minute. So Noma Dumezweni, the actress soon to play Hermione Grainger on stage in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, was applauded last year for slipping into Kim Cattrall\u2019s slingbacks in Penny Skinner\u2019s play Linda. Gough admits she is now glad to be joining a bigger cast in her next production for the National Theatre: Tony Kushner\u2019s Angels in America: \u201cRight now for two and half hours I don\u2019t stop, so I am looking forward to not having to carry it on my own. It will be nice to share it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
