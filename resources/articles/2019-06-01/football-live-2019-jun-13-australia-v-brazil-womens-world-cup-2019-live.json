An incredibly impressive comeback from the Matildas - truly one for the ages. There will be plenty of analysis to come, but for now here\u2019s Richard Parkin\u2019s match report. Thanks for joining me and sending in so many emails and tweets. I will be back for the clash with Jamaica - until then! Milicic: Hopefully this win tonight brings the country together. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. It\u2019s the first win. Coach Milicic speaks: It\u2019s one of the finest Australian performances I have seen. I am really really proud of the girls. A topical comment from Robert Wonder how the USA would\u2019ve celebrated this win... The mood was buoyant in the mixed zone - that was some win from the Matildas. Coach Ante Milicic is speaking to the press now. Here\u2019s a choice stat, via Fifa: the Matildas are only the second team in Women\u2019s World Cup history to win after a two-goal deficit. Tactical guru Richard Parkin has been sitting next to me all game \u2013 his match report will be with you shortly. Ella Reilly has been in the stands and will have her analysis online later, while Sarah Groubes should be filing her playing ratings any minute now. I will have some reaction from the press conference in the live blog, and then call it a day. Left without comment. Some choice words from Sam Kerr for the critics, that probably aren\u2019t entirely fit for print. The choice quote: \u2018Suck on that one\u2019 Sam Kerr on television: We\u2019re back. Indeed. Is this the miracle in Montpellier? Brazil had not given up a goal in the group-stage of the World Cup since 2003 - and then they gave up three, after being two-nil up. The Matildas had their backs to the wall, and they replied in style. It\u2019s all over! Australia have pulled off a dramatic comeback. Scenes here at the Stade de la Mosson. This win clearly means everything for the Matildas. 90+5 min: Free-kick to Brazil from the centre-circle. The last play of the game? 90+4 min: Foord comes off for Roestbakken, who is making her national team debut in what will surely be the final minute of this match. Dave adds his two cents to the offside controversy The original offside call on the o.g. was a clear and obvious error. I don\u2019t see why people are finding this difficult - read the 4 bullet points under \u201cinterfering with an opponent by\u201d in Law 11 (text is in the 18:35 update) - Kerr clearly didn\u2019t do any of those specific things. The fact that the defender only felt the need to head it because Kerr was there might seem like it should be a consideration, but it isn\u2019t covered by Law 11, given that Kerr didn\u2019t actually challenge for the ball. 90+3 min: Australia try to make another sub, but the referee restarts play before they get their chance. 90+2 min: They were VARing for a possible penalty to Brazil, but it did not amount to anything. 90+2 min: Williams punches away a dangerous cross to keep the Brazilians at bay. 90 min: Ludmila is trying her best to create something for Brazil, but it just isn\u2019t falling for her. The fourth official indicate she\u2019ll have another five minutes Dr Lemon writes: Australia vs Brazil in the Women\u2019s World Cup has it all: a storming comeback from Australia, end-to-end action, and plenty of needle. All it needs it some egregious diving and global financial skullduggery... 88 min: The Australians have been camped in the Brazilian half for a while. They won\u2019t be unhappy with that. 86 min: Another yellow, this time for Luana. Michael writes in: The biggest issue with Brazil\u2019s o.g. is that VAR is only supposed to act on \u201cobvious errors\u201d. Considering we\u2019re still discussing it and the refs looked at it around 50 times, I would\u2019ve said flagging offside wasn\u2019t an obvious error and we should still be at 2-2. 84 min: Andressa collects a yellow card for slapping Kellong-Knight on the face with a trailing hand while on the ball. She gives the referee some lip, too, for good measure. Australia earn a well-positioned free-kick. More helpful context on that offside/not-offside call. If, if, Australia win this, it will be their fifth consecutive victory against Brazil. Their last loss was at the 2016 Olympics, on penalties. 82 min: The Australians take their time on an attacking corner, to soak up a minute or so. Eventually it comes in and they spread it wide from the left to right and back to the defence. Classic delay tactics. Eventually they punt it forward, without success. 10 minutes plus change to go. Breath. It\u2019s going to be a hectic 10 minutes. This aptly summarises the situation, one might say. 78 min: Some scrambling defending from the Matildas deny Brazil. One of the Brazilians has gone down with a cramp. I can\u2019t blame her - my fingers are seizing up typing all this. What a match! 77 min: Kerr with another attempt, this time wide, after a nice switch move from Australia finds her on the left. It is very much still all to play for here in Montpellier. Ruth\u2019s eyebrows are raised further. So as the defenders had to react to Kerr so she is therefore offside. What should they do? Not tried to clear it away? 76 min: Kathleen darts down the right side for Brazil, but her attempt is knocked out and it is a goal-kick. Someone on Twitter has helpfully consulted the laws of the game: 75 min: Another chance for Kerr, who has come alive in the second half. She fires it at Barbara, but without enough power to cause any concern. Joshua, with this linguistic query: Is this now the appropriate time to say \u201cthe cat\u2019s among the pigeons\u201d or no? I struggle with that one. 74 min: Australia with an attacking throw-in, halfway down the Brazilian half. Before they take it, Cristiane is subbed for Beatriz. Kevin, with his eyebrows raised: Surely that call is wrong? I mean, Kerr is offside, Monica doesn\u2019t touch it if she knows but how is she supposed to know? Isn\u2019t there something about active players in an offside position? Ruth asks: Can you please explain to me why that wasn\u2019t offside. The ball was belted up to a player who was offside. I think, Ruth, that it was because Kerr did not interfere with play until she was back onside. But I agree that this call will raise a number of eyebrows. Peter has this for us, re my abject Portuguese skills. Formiga is the Portuguese word for \u201cant\u201d. Whenever I see or hear her name, I\u2019m reminded of the renowned Brazilian chef named Alex Atala, who has made his name, in part, from serving Amazonian ants over coconut meringue, and pineapples. Anyway, I\u2019m rooting for Brazil in this one. Here\u2019s hoping that Formiga makes the Australian defence feel the creepy-crawlies! 70 min: Substitute for Australia, Gielnik off for Raso. 69 min: It\u2019s a goal! VAR awards it to Australia. Own-goal from Monica. Kerr was offside at the beginning of the movement, but VAR and referee Staubli must have decided she was back onside before she interfered with play. Well, it\u2019s all happening here in Montpellier. I\u2019ll level with you, reader, no-one really know what is happening. It seems Kerr was offside but they are reviewing and reviewing. The crowd has got bored and started to do the Mexican wave. 66 min: Goal Australia! But no, it\u2019s offside from Kerr. No, they\u2019ve gone to VAR. It\u2019s all happening. 64 min: Brazil with a corner, bounces around in the area but eventually Australia clears - to Brazil. They go on another raid, only for the ball to go out for Williams to restart. It is end-to-end stuff at the moment. Peter writes in with a suggestion for Fifa to address the sparse crowds in France: I\u2019m surprised that Fifa hasn\u2019t resorted to digitally filling in empty seats to resemble the on-screen crowds in the video game that bears its name. 62 min: Australia win a free-kick on the left-hand side of the Brazil box. 61 min: Australia are camped in the Brazil penalty area for all of about 20 seconds, but can\u2019t make anything of it. Eduardo responds to some of my attemptd at VAR humour: In Uruguay, f\u00fatbol is watched and discussed at the many bars, modest neighborhood pubs, with pizza and grilled meats available. So, one of the top rated TV programs on f\u00fatbol was \u2018Pol\u00e9mica en el bar\u2019 - \u2018discussions/arguments at the bar. Guess what program is now called? Of course \u201cPol\u00e9micas del VAR\u201d. 59 min: Brazil almost goes down the other end and reclaim the advantage, but the ball goes out for a corner. Exciting stuff! 58 min: Kerr! Logarzo lofts in a nice cross from the right and Kerr almost connects, the ball flying past Barbara. The Matildas are back on level pegging. 55 min: Corner for Brazil. Debinha fires in but the Matildas clear without much difficulty. If you\u2019ll forgive the self-indulgence, Melissa, an Aussie abroad, writes in: Hola from Costa Rica. Have WiFi on a bus and loving your commentary. Go Australia! Thanks Melissa! It\u2019s times like these (namely while looking for amusing tweets) about the game, when I really regret my lack of Portuguese. 50 min: Nice free-kick from Australia, but it misses everyone. Barbara is at sea but manages to recover in-time for the follow-up shot. 48 min: Brazil try to dance down the left, without much success. They win the throw and try again, this time having more luck. A beautiful run by Cristiane as she nutmegs Kennedy and fires towards Williams, but the shot goes wide. Jogo bonito, that. Keep the messages coming in. Justin writes: That was the first group-round goal conceded by Brazil since September 27, 2003. They were unbeaten and gave up 0 goals in 2007, 2011, and 2015. Mark has this to say: The defender grabbed and pulled the shirt of the attacker, so a clear penalty. Even if it did not destabilise the attacker very much. Brazil made two changes at the break: Formiga and Marta both off, Luana and Ludmila on. Australia are unchanged. 46 min: Peep! We\u2019re back, live from the Stade de la Mosson. It\u2019s hot on the pitch (see prior post about tension) but become rather cool in the stands. I am now suitably jacket-ed. Michael asks, and answers... Why are there so many empty seats in a supposed near sell out tournament? FIFA!!! One thing very noticeable even from high in the stadium where the press box is perched: these teams do not like each other. There is some serious animosity out on the pitch. This might explain some of it: That was quite the first-half of football. Australia looked the better team for much of it, before a penalty and a nice strike from Cristiane put the Brazilians two up. It seemed the Matildas were in for a half-time lambasting from coach Ante Milicic, before they nabbed one back on the stroke of half-time. A big second 45 ahead! Rob writes in from the US of A: I understand that Sam Kerr is one of the great players in the world. However, I\u2019ve seen her turn the ball over countless times this match and she\u2019s never keen on winning it back. What gives? Peep! That\u2019s the end of the first stanza. I\u2019ll be back shortly with some analysis. 45+1 min: BAM! Australia get one back on the nick of half-time. Logarzo knocks on a cross via her head, and Foord collects at the far-corner. Just what the Matildas needed, but Brazil will still go into the break with an advantage. OB Jato wrote in to predict a 2-0 win to Brazil. I think I need a VAR check on whether their email arrived before or after their second goal... 44 min: Australia search vainly in an attempt to get one back before the break. There is some slow build-up play via the back-line, before the Matildas eventually opt for Carpenter on the right. Gielnik collects a pass on the top of the box, and fires it straight into Barbara\u2019s gloves. If Keith is still reading, I\u2019m reliably informed that the Italians are indeed showing the match - on RAI Sport2. Thanks to Markus and an unnamed reader for the dual tips. Kelsey from Seattle writes in - she\u2019s in the office and can\u2019t watch the match, so wants to know about the legitimacy of that penalty. Readers - do let me know what you think. I think it was given for Kellond-Knight dragging down her counterpart as she fell - I\u2019ve seen those given, I\u2019ve seen those not given. Well. Australia are in a world of pain here. They\u2019ve probably been the better team - not by a long way, but they have definitely had more opportunities. But Brazil have been clinical and they find themselves two goals to the good. 39 min: The hat-trick hero from Sunday is back on the score sheet! Heads a beautiful cross past Williams, and the Australians have a mountain to climb. 37 min: Sam Kerr has her first half-chance of the game, toe-poking at Barbara who collects without too much difficulty. 36 min: Australia look to find a route through the middle, before again going wide to a trio of players on the right. Nothing comes of it. Possession stats have now evened out - 53% to Australia. 33 min: The Aussies almost got a head to a corner, but Brazil\u2019s Barbara punches clear. For Brazil, meanwhile, this is a perfect start. They haven\u2019t beaten Australia since 2016 and this will very much calm the nerves. Also, how\u2019s this for a stat. The Matildas\u2019 now have their backs against the wall. While they remain a chance of qualifying for the next round even if they lose here, by beating Jamaica and being one of the better third-placed teams, that route will be arduous. Australia need to hit back here. Can they? It seems the penalty was against Kellond-Knight for a foul on Santos. Seemed a little harsh on first review but VAR presumably did its thing. The Matildas\u2019 2019 World Cup campaign continues to sour. 27 min: Marta hits it clinically to the left. That\u2019s her billionth World Cup goal*. * actual figure to be confirmed. 25 min: Brazil penalty. Not entirely clear what happened - more when I can figure out what has gone on. Keith from Canberra is currently in Italy and is very disappointed to have discovered that the Italians are not showing this game and the SBS live stream is geo-blocked. Commiserations Keith. You can follow along on here instead. 20 min: Referee Staubli from the usually neutral Switzerland has determined that it was not a penalty to Australia. Some Aussie fans boo half-heartedly. It\u2019s VAR o\u2019clock! 19 min: Yallop goes down in the box and there\u2019s talk of a penalty, but the referee waves it away. 17 min: Bit of biff going on between Cristiane and van Egmond. Unclear what started it, but the referee soon brings everything under control. 15 min: Andressa goes on a delightful mazy run down the right for Brazil, sending in a nicely weighted ball which bounces just out of reach of the on-rusher attacker. My inbox and Twitter feed are suspiciously quiet (I suspect that might correlate with it being 2.15am on the east coast of Australia right now). But that\u2019s no excuse for the rest of the world. Get your missives in via email or twitter me @KieranPender. 14 min: This time the Australians raid down the left, and win a corner. They are looking dangerous from both flanks. 13 min: First yellow card of the match goes to veteran Formiga, playing in her record seventh (SEVENTH!) World Cup. 12 min: Another chance for Australia from the right, another missed opportunity after some back-and-forth in the box... 11 min: Williams rushes off her line to make a save - a tense moment for the Matildas after Cristiane caused danger. 10 min: Australia are making a lot of hay on the right-hand side, but their frequent crosses into Sam Kerr are failing to connect. Still, dangerous - and Brazil will need to improve their defensive effort on that side. 8 min: I was beginning to suspect that Australia were enjoying the lion\u2019s share of possession and Fifa have proven me right: 72%, at the time of writing. But they haven\u2019t made it count, yet. 5 min: Ellie Carpenter making an impact on the right for Australia - she smashes in a nice ball, which bounces around but no Matilda can connect and Brazil eventually clear. Carpenter was one of the highlights in Australia\u2019s otherwise disappointing performance against Italy. She\u2019s just 19 and has a big future ahead of her. 3 min: Australia are right back down the other end, with Foord swinging a ball in but it amounts to nothing. Fairly end-to-end football so far. 2 min: Brazil get the first real opportunity of the match, with Tamires breaking down the left wing. She fires the ball in but Australian custodian Williams smothers it without difficulty. 1 min: Peeepppppp! We are underway, with the Matildas kicking off. Old rivals Australia and Brazil in the second-round of Group C matches at the 2019 Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup. Let\u2019s go! The anthems are blaring and we are just minutes away from kick-off. Don\u2019t go anywhere! With 10 minutes to kick-off, the Fifa DJ starts cycling through the usual selection of tracks. AC/DC\u2019s Thunderstruck is a firm favourite, and you know things are about to get serious when \u2018Seven Nation Army\u2019 by the White Stripes begins to crank. At the men\u2019s World Cup in Russia, the Socceroos would be serenaded by classic \u2018Down Under\u2019 by Men at Work. No such luck for the Matildas. We should start a petition... I have crowdsourced predictions from the Guardian Australia\u2019s coverage team (plus AAP\u2019s ever-reliable scribe Ben McKay), which indicates we are a fairly optimistic bunch and expecting a high-scoring affair in Montpellier: Ella Reilly: 3-2 Australia Richard Parkin: 3-0 Australia Kieran Pender: 3-1 Australia Ben McKay: 2-2 draw Our friends at The Fiver, meanwhile, have tipped a 3-1 win for Brazil. Interesting choice of words from Australia\u2019s Alana Kennedy ahead of the match: We have the rivalry with Brazil now at the last two major tournaments, where we knocked them out and they knocked us out. But when you\u2019re on the field I don\u2019t give a shit who [Marta] is \u2013 she\u2019s an opponent and I want to beat her. Key points from the teams: Australia\u2019s Elise Kellond-Knight is back in the starting line-up, but has been shuffled to left-back, while Emily Gielnik has been brought into the attacking fold, replacing Hayley Raso. The big news for Brazil is that veteran Marta, six-time Fifa player of the year, has been elevated into the XI after spending the Jamaica game on the bench. Both teams have brought colourful contingents of supporters to Montpellier. For those who prefer their line-ups in visual form: This is the sort of content I can get behind. Here are the line-ups: Australia (4-3-3): Williams, Kellond-Knight, Catley, Kennedy, Carpenter, Logarzo, van Egmond, Yallop, Foord, Kerr (c), Gielnik Brazil (4-1-4-1): Barbara, Thaisa, Tamires, Andressa, Formiga, Debinha, Marta (c), Cristiane, L Santos, Kathellen, M\u00f4nica And Parkin\u2019s preview of today\u2019s encounter. As I just told him in the media centre, his great opening paragraph \u2013 complete with Caesar, the Rubicon and some Latin \u2013 is actually somewhat ironic given Montpellier is one of the few major settlements in the south of France that doesn\u2019t have a Roman past. How\u2019s that for #history! My colleague Richard Parkin has been busy of late. Here\u2019s his take on the Matildas\u2019 long-standing rivalry with Brazil: Some initial pre-reading for you all \u2013 our comprehensive team guides to Australia and Brazil respectively: Hello and welcome to Montpellier. The sun is shining and the scene is set. It might be hyperbolic to say that this encounter with Brazil is do or die for the Matildas, but it certainly comes pretty close. Lose or draw today and the Australians face a must-win clash with Jamaica next week; the probable outcome being a third-placed finish in Group C and a tough Round of 16 opponent. If the Matildas continue their strong form against Brazil - they have won four straight - Australia\u2019s campaign will be back on the road and the loss to Italy swiftly forgotten. For Brazil, their 3-0 triumph over Jamaica on Sunday was the perfect way to snap a nine game losing streak. But Jamaica were hardly difficult opposition. Today\u2019s match should indicate whether that victory was a temporary uptick on a long, downhill slump, or a return to their scintillating form of old. Whatever the case, I\u2019m standing by here at Stade de la Mosson to bring you a blow by blow account. Do let me know what you think along the way, via email or Twitter: @KieranPender."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
