It was the 72nd minute, when Alex Goode scored the try that put Saracens out of reach and Vunipola remembers it so clearly because he was running on fumes \u2013 the petrol warning light, by that stage, had been flashing for a while. \u201cI looked up at the clock and there were still eight minutes left,\u201d says Vunipola. \u201cI wondered how I was going to last. I remember just how tired I was at that point. It just shows how much you have to work to grind down a team like Clermont because they are never out of the game. It was one of those moments where I felt like we had broken the dam. It was a good feeling. Well, it wasn\u2019t at the time but now, reflecting, it was.\u201d It is to the benefit of Saracens and Vunipola then, that the loosehead prop was given what he describes as a week of pre-season when Eddie Jones decided to rest the two-times British &amp; Irish Lions tourist for England\u2019s third and last autumn international against Samoa. Jones had not long beforehand said of Vunipola that he \u201cloves playing, hates training\u201d but the conditioning programme he was placed on has had the desired effect. \u201cIt\u2019s not great when someone tells you you\u2019re not playing, you obviously want to play every game you can, especially at international level,\u201d says Vunipola. \u201cBut I knew the plan and it\u2019s not my choice, it\u2019s the coach\u2019s choice. It was different to watch the game on the sidelines and on game day, when I woke up, I didn\u2019t really have the nerves or the jitters. I wouldn\u2019t say I enjoyed it but it\u2019s part of the job. \u201cMy programmes are a little bit different. Usually in the week I only think about the weekend coming up and what I need to do to improve on the previous game but it was like a pre-season week where you work on other things. For me it was refreshing, because when you get to November and December you\u2019re usually in full-on rugby mode.\u201d His club return \u2013 along with those of the rest of Saracens\u2019 injury-free internationals \u2013 did not bring an immediate end to the European champions\u2019 poor run of results, however, and a fifth defeat in a row, by Harlequins last Sunday, led to a couple of sleepless nights for Vunipola. With Clermont, the Top 14 champions, languishing in ninth place in their domestic league though, last season\u2019s finalists and Europe\u2019s top titans for the last couple of years clash with a few unfamiliar doubts over form. For both sides injuries have played their part \u2013 Saracens are without Maro Itoje, Liam Williams, Schalk Brits and Michael Rhodes while Clermont are so badly hit at fly-half that they have drafted in the versatile outside back Isaia Toeava, who has spent most of his time with the club at full-back, for Sunday\u2019s match at Allianz Park, the first of back-to-back meetings between the sides. \u201cSunday night and Monday night there wasn\u2019t much sleep,\u201d says Vunipola. \u201cAs a player you\u2019re always going through situations and scenarios and think how they might have been different. It was more playing over what we can learn from Sunday and the last couple of weeks. We\u2019ve got some experienced players and coaches who have been around long enough to know we don\u2019t become a bad team in a week, or a month. We\u2019re still very confident in ourselves and the great thing, at this time of year, is that it\u2019s not the end of the world. There are no panic stations now.\u201d Vunipola also gives short shrift to the suggestion that Clermont\u2019s domestic form weakens their challenge, highlighting the threat of their No8 Fritz Lee, in particular. \u201cThey\u2019re a team with a lot of world-class players, there are a lot that pop into your head straight away but they are a team that do the basics very well,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir set piece is second to none, the forward pack do the hard graft but they can also break you down out wide as well. There are a few x-factor players but those that make them tick are in the forwards. Fritz is a world-class No8, he leads from the front with his carrying, and we know we have to stand up to that. It\u2019s going to take a 90-minute effort because we know they can score from anywhere.\u201d Vunipola is not convinced May\u2019s 28-17 success at Murrayfield will have any bearing on Sunday\u2019s proceedings, pointing to how Saracens recovered from losing the 2013-14 final to Toulon, a week before succumbing to Northampton in the Premiership final. \u201cNo game is the same,\u201d he says. \u201cThis year they have improved their squad and they will have learnt from that like we did a couple of years ago after losing both finals. There\u2019s no such thing as having a hold over a team. It\u2019s whoever is the better team on the day. We know how good they are and how good we have to be to beat them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
