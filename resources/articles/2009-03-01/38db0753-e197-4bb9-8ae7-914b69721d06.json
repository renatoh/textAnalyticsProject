Illicit cultivation is also on the rise in the Shan states of Burma. UN drug officials are alarmed that the effect of the global economic crisis on the value of cash crops is tempting impoverished hill farmers to return to growing the one crop that offers stable financial returns. Only a few years ago, Antonio Maria Costa, the anti-narcotics chief at the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), talked about the \"success story\" of opium eradication in Laos and Burma. He claimed Laos had become \"opium-free\", and that Burma had vastly reduced its cultivation. Costa even forecast the demise of the Golden Triangle \u2013 the notorious mountainous area covering parts of Burma, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, which at one time was the world's main poppy producer. But now his prediction is rapidly unraveling. In fact, long before the global crisis caused commodity prices to crash, crop substitution had failed to provide alternative sources of income. In the Wa region of Burma, farmers have been calling on authorities to allow a return to the poppy cultivation that was suspended almost three years ago. Some have moved to other parts of the Shan states to grow opium again. And in Laos's Xheng Khouang Province, villagers want the opium ban to be lifted. Many farmers are now secretly defying the authorities. The wisdom and sustainability of UN's anti-opium strategy has been consistently challenged by NGOs, development workers and academics. Dr David Feingold, an anthropologist and expert on the Akha hill tribe says: \"The opium eradication policy in Laos was both poorly conceived and poorly executed.\" Without viable alternatives, former opium farmers became destitute and dependent on emergency food aid from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP). Given that the UN millennium objectives are all about enhancing food security, the hastily implemented campaign against opium cultivation had achieved just the opposite. A French NGO worker in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, says the anti-opium policy imposed by western governments focused \"on eradication more than finding alternatives to opium. They pushed for opium elimination before economic development was in place\". In spite of criticism, even from some other UN agencies including the WFP, the UNODC has never appeared to waver in its hard-line enforcement strategies heavily influenced by Washington's ideological \"war on drugs\". Former Australian ambassador in Laos Jonathan Thwaites expressed misgivings about the opium crackdown some years ago arguing that the surge of ATS amphetamines was far more dangerous than opium. \"We (meaning western embassies) have put too much emphasis on opium eradication, but amphetamines are much worse problem and they should be the priority.\" But the international pressure on opium eradication remained in place, rather than switching priorities to coping with the real scourge \u2013 amphetamines. Before anti-narcotics agents and the UNODC arrived in Laos in the 1990s, the traditional cultivation of opium dating back to the early 19th-century had never constituted a major drug problem. Anthropologists noted that opium was very useful for the Hmong, Akha and other hill tribes as a cash crop and as a medicine not only for its painkilling content as morphine, but also effective in the treatment of coughs and stomach problems. In fact, very little of the estimated 100 tons of opium that Laos produced in its poppy heyday was ever converted into heroin for the world market \u2013 that nearly all came from the opium warlords of Burma and their Chinese \"chemists\" who, by mixing opium with some chemical additives, produced heroin. But although some heroin passed through in transit, in Laos heroin addicts were almost unknown until recently. However, since the zealous opium eradications, Laos sadly has acquired a burgeoning drug problem with the rapid proliferation of \"yaa ba\" (amphetamines) sweeping the country and another Burmese import \u2013 heroin has made an appearance. In lieu of opium, speed and heroin have taken over the market, with far worse consequences. One respected Laotian academic, Houmphanh Rattanavong, commented with irony: \"Now our drug problem is not opium \u2013 but the lack of opium.\" Where before Laos had no significant drug problem beyond a few thousand opium addicts \u2013 which affected a far smaller percentage of the population than the number of alcoholics in the UK \u2013 the anti-poppy campaign has unwittingly contributed to a drugs epidemic with 40,000 addicts causing huge social problems. UNODC has treated all narcotics as more or less equally evil \u2013 from cannabis at one end of the spectrum to amphetamines and heroin at the other. This hardline enforcement approach takes little or no account of public health issues. The Asian Harm Reduction Network (AHRN) has criticised the tough enforcement policies that drive drug-users underground and, in the case of injecting drug-users, often leads to the spreads of HIV. Whether in Afghanistan, Burma or Laos the UNODC needs to think again about the sustainability of alternative development and opium eradication. So many farmers have been forced to abandon their livelihood growing opium and make huge sacrifices for nothing. There has been little or no alternative development promised by the authorities and the UN drugs agency, only a few flagship projects. Opium farmers have every right to feel angry because they have been deceived with a false prospectus \u2013 so who can look them in the eye and say they have no right to feed their families and grow opium again? But opium does not have to be viewed as a demon drug to be destroyed. Some western countries \u2013 Australia, France and Spain \u2013 are licensed to grow opium for pharmaceutical purposes. Why shouldn't the poor farmers of Laos be allowed to? The World Health Organisation reports that 80% of the world's population consumes just 6% of its morphine \u2013 the number one opiate for severe pain, an outrageous imbalance that only serves to highlight the appalling lack of painkilling drugs in the many parts of the world. There are 45 million people living with HIV/Aids in countries where health systems are either absent or very poor, and over the next 20 years there will be some 10 million new cases of cancer in the developing world. Many of them will die in agony unless more morphine is made available. Crop substitution has failed. Now it is time to bring more opium into the pharmaceutical market under international supervision and at the same time end the plight of poor farmers by legalising their poppy cultivation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
