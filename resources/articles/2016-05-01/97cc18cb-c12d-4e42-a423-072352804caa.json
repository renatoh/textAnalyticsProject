Guy St Onge, who proselytizes frequently on YouTube, told the Guardian he was no longer a delegate for the presumptive Republican nominee. Onge has in the past shared social media postings appearing to advocate killing Muslims and last year claimed: \u201cBarack Hussein Obama and his tranny wife Michelle hate the USA!\u201d St Onge, who is listed on the California secretary of state\u2019s official list as one of three delegates pledged to Trump from California\u2019s 35th congressional district, declined to say precisely when he stood down. The list was formally submitted by the Trump campaign on Monday night. However St Onge informed the Guardian of his decision to relinquish his delegate spot hours after reporters contacted the Trump campaign asking for confirmation the controversial pastor was among a colorful list of delegates, some of whom have a controversial past. On Tuesday, the Trump campaign was forced to distance itself from another one of their delegates, self-avowed white nationalist William Daniel Johnson, who once called for a constitutional amendment which would revoke citizenship for all non-white Americans. It was at first unclear if either St Onge or Johnson could be formally removed from Trump\u2019s delegate list. California\u2019s secretary of state said on Tuesday that the Trump campaign had attempted to send a revised delegate list after news broke about Johnson\u2019s inclusion. However, because they had missed the deadline, a spokesperson for the secretary of state said the initial list must stand. But late Wednesday afternoon, the Trump campaign told the Guardian that an updated list of its delegates was posted on the website of the California Republican party, without William Johnson and Guy St Onge on it. According to his voluminous social media presence, St Onge is an evangelical pastor living in Ontario, California. His numerous Facebook accounts, YouTube videos and Tumblr page feature videos of his preaching, photos of himself carrying rifles and anti-Muslim memes. A meme shared on one of his Facebook pages reads: \u201cAllah SUCKS/ Mohammed SUCKS/ Islam SUCKS/ Any of you Hadji\u2019s have an issue with me saying this, PM me and I\u2019ll gladly give you my address. You can come visit me, where I promise/ I will/ KILL YOU/ In my front yard!!\u201d Reached by a reporter through Facebook, St Onge replied Wednesday afternoon: \u201cI am no longer a delegate, by my own choosing ... I will take one for the team, Loyal to a fault you might say ... Jesus loves you, but not the trouble you try and cause for others.\u201d Asked about precisely when he ceased being a delegate, St Onge replied: \u201cI have spoken to the appropriate people . thank you, Have a great day and may God bless you ...\u201d He subsequently posted a Facebook post about a Guardian reporter on another Facebook account, writing: \u201cThis is a reporter who started doing a story on me ... who is she to call the kettle black?\u201dThe post has since been deleted. In a later message, St Onge wrote: \u201cI see you are not a Christian so that tells me a lot about you and who you represent!!\u201d Asked about a report that he had once burned a Mexican flag, St Onge responded: \u201cNo, that is not true, even if it was, they burn ours don\u2019t they?\u201d The pastor then messaged a reporter several links to a video of two men, one wearing a Trump T-shirt, burning a Mexican flag. \u201cI would call these men my brothers, US Citizen brothers!!,\u201d he wrote. According to a biography on one of St Onge\u2019s Facebook pages, he \u201cwas in a very bad world, full of drugs, motorcycles, gangs and cops and more\u201d before he was reborn and baptized in September 1995. \u201cFor me my life used to be all about Sex, Drugs and Rock&amp;Roll ... Now it is God Jesus and the Holy Ghost,\u201d he writes on Facebook. On 27 March 2016, St Onge posted about his application to be a Trump delegate on Facebook, writing: \u201cI JUST SIGNED UP TO BECOME A NATIONAL DELEGATE FOR DONALD TRUMP, I WILL NOT FIND OUT UNTIL March 31, 2016. WHEN THEY DECIDE ...\u201d St Onge is the second California delegate to attempt to drop out after Johnson, a corporate attorney and prominent white nationalist from Los Angeles. Trump\u2019s campaign blamed Johnson\u2019s inclusion on a \u201cdatabase error\u201d and said he was no longer a delegate. His campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Mixed in with Bible verses and YouTube sermons, St Onge shares a wide variety of political material, including anti-same sex marriage memes, a meme featuring the Confederate flag that reads \u201c620,000 Died for this flag they deserve to be honored\u201d, and a \u201cChristian for Trump\u201d image with the attached commentary: \u201cNot saying Trump is a very godly man, but God can use anyone even evil to bless His people which are not just the Jews any longer but even the Gentiles now, for we are all under the same God ...\u201d Another post features a photoshopped image of Barack Obama and David Cameron kissing, with the caption: \u201cSodomites!!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
