Known for his aggressive attacks on the Brazilian left, Danilo Gentili, 39, was sentenced by a judge in S\u00e3o Paulo on Tuesday for his comments about Maria do Ros\u00e1rio, a congresswoman for the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. He remains free pending appeal. Gentili was tried over a 2017 video he shared on social media, in which he ripped up a notice he had been sent by the Brazilian congress asking him to remove offensive tweets about Do Ros\u00e1rio, stuffed it into his underpants and directed obscenities at her. In her ruling, Judge Maria do Prado wrote he could have removed the tweets or taken legal advice. Instead, he \u201cdecided to record a video with highly offensive and reproachable content, leaving very clear your intention to offend\u201d. Do Ros\u00e1rio has often been a target for attacks from the Brazilian right. In February, Brazil\u2019s supreme court upheld a ruling that Jair Bolsonaro pay her about \u00a33,000 ($3,920) in damages for telling her she \u201cdid not deserve\u201d to be raped in 2014. On Tuesday, Bolsonaro was criticized for expressing solidarity with Gentili, despite failing to do so for the family of a Rio man who was killed earlier in the week when soldiers fired 80 bullets into his car. Do Ros\u00e1rio welcomed Tuesday\u2019s verdict in a series of tweets. \u201cImpunity can\u2019t prevail in any way when you are dealing with people\u2019s honour,\u201d she said, while the Workers\u2019 party president, Gleisi Hoffmann, tweeted clapping hands. But the leftist blog O Cafezinho (the Little Coffee) called the verdict \u201cmistaken\u201d, saying: \u201cToday it\u2019s Danilo Gentili, a humourist hated by the left. Tomorrow it could be anyone who said some tough words against the Bolsonaro family.\u201d Gentili \u2013 who once shared a positive tweet about fascism and linked the leftwing Socialism and Freedom party to paedophiles in a standup show \u2013 tried to laugh off the sentence. \u201cI\u2019m worried about who will bring me a cellphone in prison, who will bring cigarettes,\u201d he told the Jovem Pan radio station. \u201cI prefer to be jailed than kneel down,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I did anything wrong.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
