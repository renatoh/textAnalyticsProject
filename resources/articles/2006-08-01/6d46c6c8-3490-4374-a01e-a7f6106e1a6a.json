From Thierry Henry at 5-2 to Ade Akinbiyi at 250-1, there were 44 players from 19 clubs but, on Tyneside, no one from Newcastle United. Around the corner at Ladbrokes it was slightly better for those Newcastle fans for whom the season is beginning in a fog of post-Alan Shearer pessimism: there was Ameobi - 100-1. Not exactly a ringing endorsement, even though Ameobi scored six times in his last 11 games of last season, more a comment on a player yet to break into double figures for goals in a league campaign . Not yet 25, Ameobi is suffering from having been part of the furniture at St James' Park for six years. Part of this is because Ameobi has been behind Shearer, Craig Bellamy, Michael Owen, even Carl Cort, for a lot of that time, but part of it, Ameobi accepts, is his fault: he was so belligerent towards Marcel Desailly on his debut appearance in September 2000 that expectations grew of a virile homegrown companion for Shearer. Much of what has followed has been disappointing for both player and fans - \"I know I've been too nice,\" Ameobi has said - and there have been injuries. But Saturday brought some evidence that post-Shearer, Ameobi is beginning to find his own space. He said he woke up thinking: \"Goals, goals, goals.\" Although Newcastle were fortunate to win the game, they nevertheless scored twice. Ameobi created the first for Scott Parker with a purposeful run and cross, then steered in the winner after Charles N'Zogbia, released by a beautiful flick from Damien Duff, rattled the fists of Chris Kirkland. With online bookies, Ameobi was mainly 50-1 yesterday. Glenn Roeder said afterwards that his only forward has to rid himself of a \"tag\" and yet ogoing diffidence means Ameobi does not want the vacant No9 shirt. Roeder also said that he is \"close\" to signing a striker who may want it, but someone who will play alongside, not in place of, Ameobi. Patrick Bastianelli, who represents Internazionale's Obafemi Martins, was due for talks at St James' yesterday. Wigan Athletic showed the benefit of having a strong forward partnership. Emile Heskey and Henri Camara were playing their first league match together but there is already an understanding and, although their manager Paul Jewell complained about a ball-to-hand incident in injury-time featuring Titus Bramble, Jewell's real frustration stemmed from seeing his team pin Newcastle back for an hour yet still lose. Newcastle were hampered by early injuries to Nicky Butt and Craig Moore, and Ameobi hobbled off 10 minutes after scoring, aggravating fears about his longstanding hip problem. Jewell gave six players debuts and had the satisfaction of seeing them gel. He knows this season will again be tough but his tenacity is formidable and it may help him hold on to Pascal Chimbonda. The troublesome Frenchman would have played here but for a calf strain and Jewell said: \"I spoke to Daniel Levy and he told me Tottenham's interest [in Chimbonda] has ended. So unless something comes out of the blue, it's over.\" Man of the match: Shola Ameobi (Newcastle United)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
