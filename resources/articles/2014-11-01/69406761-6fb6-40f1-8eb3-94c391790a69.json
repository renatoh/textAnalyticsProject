Mexicans and Brazilians too, would be welcome under his new regime. The Tory party grandee once attracted controversy for his \u201ccricket test\u201d \u2013 in which he said that the loyalty of British Asians could be measured by who they supported in international cricket matches. Now, he has told BBC Newsnight, would-be UK citizens should be asked which side their fathers or grandfathers fought for during the second world war. \u201cOne test I would use is to ask them on which side their fathers or grandfathers or whatever fought in the second world war,\u201d Tebbit said. \u201cAnd so you\u2019ll find that the Poles and the Czechs and the Slovaks were all on the right side. And so that\u2019s a pretty good test isn\u2019t it? Perhaps we\u2019ll even manage to teach them to play cricket gradually over the years.\u201d Poles and Czechs aren\u2019t the only ones who would be welcome, however. The allied powers during the war also included the United Sates, the former Soviet Union, Brazil, Mexico, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, Norway, Holland, Belgium, Denmark and South Africa. And that\u2019s not including the UK\u2019s former colony of India (then including what is now Pakistan and Bangladesh) which sent hundreds of thousands of troops. The status of Italians and Romanians, whose home nations switched sides from the Axis to Allied powers in 1943 and 1944 is unclear. Tebbit, 83, the former MP for Chingford, made his cricket test remarks in 1990 in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. He argued that immigrants and their children could not be considered truly loyal to Britain if they supported the cricket team of their country of origin. \u201cA large proportion of Britain\u2019s Asian population fail to pass the cricket test,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich side do they cheer for? It\u2019s an interesting test. Are you still harking back to where you came from or where you are?\u201d Since then he has come out in support of the national Asian cricket awards, held at Lord\u2019s in October, saying that a new generation of Asian cricketers has helped Britons with Asian heritage rally around the England side. \u201cIn recent years, British Asian players have again given us some of that swashbuckling style of play which the crowds are willing to pay to watch,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only that, but it encourages the generations of British-born Asians to feel part of the nation \u2013 and those of long British ancestry to welcome them into our team.\u201d Tebbit was responding to David Cameron\u2019s big immigration speech in which the prime minister stepped back from demanding caps on EU migrants. \u201cI don\u2019t think what David Cameron said today is going to solve our problems because he has to get the agreement of the other 27 heads of government in order to put most of the things which he proposed into action,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get net immigration down to the 100,000 mark, which was the promise he made. We\u2019re simply going the wrong way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
