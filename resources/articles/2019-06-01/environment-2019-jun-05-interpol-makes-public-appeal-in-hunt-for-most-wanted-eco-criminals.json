Interpol made a public appeal on Wednesday, to coincide with World Environment Day, to boost its efforts to find seven people responsible for wide-ranging environmental crimes. Their offences include dumping hazardous waste, illegal logging and ivory smuggling. The seven men are subject to Interpol red notices and are wanted internationally. They include two Albanian men alleged to have illegally logged a state forest in Greece and two Chinese men wanted for smuggling protected species. J\u00fcrgen Stock, Interpol\u2019s secretary general, said: \u201cEnvironmental crime is occurring on an industrial scale, with transnational organised crime groups making billions in profits whilst undermining the rule of law and threatening national security. \u201cEnvironmental crimes have a global impact, which require a global response.\u201d The seven people are: \u2022 Guo Qin Huang, 42, and Muk Nam Wong, 62, wanted by China for smuggling protected species and products derived from them. \u2022 Nicholas Mweri Jefwa, 44, and Samuel Bakari Jefwa, 29, wanted by Kenya for illicitly dealing in wildlife trophies and organised criminal activity. \u2022 Albanian brothers Ergest Memo, 34, and Taulant Memo, 33, wanted by Greece for illegal logging in a protected forest. Taulant Memo is also wanted for illegally carrying a gun. \u2022 Bhekumusa Mawillis Shiba, 39, wanted by Eswatini \u2013 formerly Swaziland - for wildlife offences. Environmental crimes are hugely profitable for those at the peak of the criminal networks. Profits are estimated at between $110bn and $281bn (\u00a386bn-\u00a3220bn) a year. Ministers at the G7 summit in April called for greater efforts to fight environmental crime through increased cooperation and information sharing with Interpol. The agency urged the public not to directly approach the men but to contact the local police or Interpol."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
