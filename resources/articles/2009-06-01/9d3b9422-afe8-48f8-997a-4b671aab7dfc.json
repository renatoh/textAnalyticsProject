We have reached Kaka-saturation, from the daily Kaka newspaper update to rolling 24-hour Kaka on those satellite TV channels where they force impossibly attractive young women to sit next to men with piercing eyes and read endlessly looped Kaka gumf in return for a vague sense that some day they might get to do the weather or stand in front of a building saying things in a jacket. It was fun, though, being doused in Kaka. Kaka himself seemed soulful and trusting, like King Kong manacled in his crate and trundling through New York en route to his exploitation and tragic death. Of course, it couldn't last. This was in many ways a usurping, and sure enough by the end of the week Cristiano Ronaldo was back, his own sputtering Real Madrid transfer saga revving up, raising the prospect of a twin-pronged summer of denial and insinuation and men looking sinister at airports. Clearly, something needs to be done about this. There is only one way to stop the Kaka-fuelled Ronaldo saga resurgence. We need to get it over with. I believe we can force him to go. It will take some planning. Ronaldo is very fast, so there's no point trying to capture and incapacitate him, perhaps using something dabbed on cotton wool and held to his gasping, fish-like mouth. Instead we need to use guile. Ronaldo is a playful soul. We might be able to gain his trust by playing hide and seek and letting him hide every time, or offering him an amateurish and overly long neck massage that actually hurts quite a lot. The next step is to get him in the minicab to the airport. This is best done by pretending to be on your way to a high-end European disco peopled by orange-skinned women and shirtless, high-fiving men in sunglasses. At the airport Ronaldo can be quite easily distracted. Jostle him lightly in the big Toblerones shop and allow him to perform his enraged-ballerina pose plus range of wounded, angry and wryly resigned facial expressions. Take a photo of him soulfully applauding with his shirt off. And cover your tracks by scrawling \"disco with orange women\" in ballpoint over the \"Madrid\" bit on your Ryanair Dustbin Class boarding passes. Once you've got him on board, Ronaldo may become confused. He may ask questions. Why is the child behind him daubing the back of his head with Dairylea? Why are you dressed in stained corduroy slacks, rather than ice-white designer jeans and an expensive puffy shirt with the face of Tupac Shakur picked out in Swarovski crystals? This would be the ideal time to distract him by humming Phil Collins songs, or suggesting you re-enact his favourite Elton John/George Michael duet, the one where George says \"It's Mr Elton John!\" and Elton sings \"Don'tuhletuhssuuunggodaaarghornmeeeyeah!\". Failing that you might be best off jamming him inside the little toilet at the back, or wedging a drinks trolley across the aisle and pretending not to understand when he signals to be let out. Once you land in Madrid, it's job done. Ronaldo can be released into the wild. This is his natural habitat. This is the southern European football dream. This is a confused man in mirrored shades wandering through the dandelions on the central reservation muttering about discos. Now, Kaka. Best make it quick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
