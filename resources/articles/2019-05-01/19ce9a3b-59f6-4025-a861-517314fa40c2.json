In his living room, 76-year-old Brian Reader (Kenneth Cranham) bent down groaningly to tie his shoelaces before heading off with his gang of ageing crims to pull off a \u00a314m heist in London\u2019s diamond district. You could have put the kettle on, ground the beans and brewed the coffee before he finished. Try Velcro next time, squire. But it was Timothy Spall as 61-year-old Terry Perkins I was most concerned about. Over breakfast, his daughter told him: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be going out drinking any more Dad. Look at you!\u201d \u201cI ain\u2019t dead, yet,\u201d Perkins told his daughter. Not quite. But he did look a right state. Whenever I looked at Spall in the opening episode of this four-part drama, I worried he had ill-advisedly copied Christian Bale\u2019s starvation preparation for The Machinist for this role as wizened muppet plotting one last pay day. When he cased the Hatton Garden Safety Deposit Company, his shirt collar was too big for his age-shrunken neck; the closeups of the haggard old lag in the van on the way to the heist were no less concerning. Throughout, his sad-eyed stare through untamed greying eyebrows was that of someone on the brink of dotage. \u201cYou get knackered cutting your toenails, Terry,\u201d Reader told his fellow veteran blagger. Two words, here: pot, kettle. Perkins brooded on that slur and a few scenes later retorted: \u201cI don\u2019t get knackered cutting my toenails. I just take my time. I have to be careful with my extremities,\u201d he added, mysteriously. Such was the Hatton Garden heist \u2013 the improbable in pursuit of the impenetrable. Not so much true crime as near death. Jeff Pope delighted in writing these needling exchanges between the two old hands, which was one reason the drama was more compelling than The Hatton Garden Job, the 2017 film of the same robbery, starring Larry Lamb and David Calder. Pope also revelled in the bitter Beckettian comedy of ageing. Once inside the safety deposit company building, Reader and Perkins needed to take a leak. But Reader\u2019s wouldn\u2019t come and Perkins\u2019s wouldn\u2019t stop. For all their thrusts and parries as they fenced during the heist, they were never destined to cross the proverbial golden swords. Don\u2019t look so smug, reader: one of those urinary destinies probably awaits you. Pope was also savvy in precisely situating the drama on the Easter weekend of 2015. On the radio, the news namechecked Ed Miliband \u2013 then a contender to be prime minister. Britain has been through so much in the four years since to make that year\u2019s election campaign seem as distant as the Peloponnesian wars. At another moment, as the thieves scarpered to the roof fearing a security guard was about to rumble them, the Old Bailey\u2019s tower loomed at the back of the shot, as if foreshadowing the gang\u2019s later dates with criminal justice. Indeed, earlier this year, the last of the gang to be nicked, the electronics whiz known as \u201cBasil\u201d \u2013 real name Michael Seed \u2013 was jailed for 10 years for his role in the job. If only the Hatton Garden gang had displayed such attention to detail as Pope. How could Basil have been so faulty (sorry) in disabling the alarm system? The amber light flashing on the control box, as sinisterly cyclopic as Hal\u2019s eye in 2001: A Space Odyssey, told us that the security firm \u2013 and thus the Old Bill \u2013 had been alerted to the intrusion. Reader had ingeniously planned to bypass the 50cm-thick tempered steel door by drilling through the walls with an industrial drill. But why hadn\u2019t he discovered that the safety deposit boxes were bolted to the walls and so more difficult to dislodge? It wasn\u2019t only the steel door that was thick. As with the best heist dramas (think Jules Dassin\u2019s 1955 Rififi rather than Ocean\u2019s Eleven), Hatton Garden unfolded wordlessly. There was much sweaty manhandling of machine tools and testosterone-charged glaring. But the best silent comedy came from 75-year-old John \u201cKenny\u201d Collins (Alex Norton), the purported lookout. He settled himself in a chair in an office overlooking the vault entrance then opened his attache case which contained the biggest packed lunch in the history of crime. Hold on. Was that a slice of battenberg nestling between banana and apple? Just as it is folly to take a knife to a gun fight, surely it is madness to pack cake for a heist. But Collins\u2019s ludicrous lunch wasn\u2019t enough. Criminally, he left his post to get a takeaway and then, back at his post, sated with cake and chips, he nodded off. Mate, you had one job. In the basement as Collins kipped, the other crooks drilled through feet of reinforced concrete, only to flee empty-handed when one of the pieces of kit broke down. \u201cWhatever we do from now on, we\u2019d be making it up, and that\u2019s how you get caught,\u201d ruled Reader. And so, part one ended with the van containing six disappointed twerps pulling away in that Easter dawn, leaving the loot in the basement vault. Spall\u2019s wandering eyes, though, glimpsed through overhanging eyebrows before the closing credits, told us he had unfinished business. They disclosed eloquently that the gang will return to finish the job in episode two. Although with hindsight, we know they shouldn\u2019t have bothered."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
