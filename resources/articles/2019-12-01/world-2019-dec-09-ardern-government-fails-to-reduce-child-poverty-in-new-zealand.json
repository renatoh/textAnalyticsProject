The children\u2019s commissioner, Andrew Becroft, released the annual child poverty monitor on Monday which has found 148,000 children live in homes experiencing material hardship in six or more areas, including lack of access to basics such as warm clothing, health care and food. The figures are unchanged since the first report into child poverty in 2012. Becroft said the poverty monitor showed the government was not meeting its ambition of drastically reducing child poverty, and bolder action was required. \u201cI want to see family incomes dramatically raised by increasing benefits and making the minimum wage a living wage,\u201d Becroft said. \u201cAnd the government needs to move much faster at increasing the supply of social housing \u2013 building, buying and repurposing \u2013 and working closely with community-based housing providers.\u201d Other suggestions included immediately boosting the income of beneficiaries by 20-40%, widening the free school lunches programme, and making health and dental care free for all children up until the age of 18 or even 21. The commissioner said New Zealand already had the resources and ability to reduce child poverty, but it was not working fast, or hard enough. The child poverty reduction legislation, the child and youth wellbeing strategy, the winter energy payment and the best start payment for children all drew praise from the commissioner, but the Labour Coalition government, led by Jacinda Ardern needed to focus on \u201csignificant and permanent changes\u201d \u2013 not \u201cone-offs\u201d, he said. The number of families on the waiting list for state housing was at record highs. Last month, on world children\u2019s day, Ardern said she was proud her government had made \u201ca good start\u201d on addressing child poverty. \u201cOne of our toughest long-term challenges is to tackle child poverty,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cI\u2019m proud that we\u2019ve made a good start on our plan to ensure families can give their kids the best possible start at life, which benefits all of New Zealand.\u201d The commissioner\u2019s report is backed up by poverty groups on the ground, which say they are disappointed by the lack of urgency in the sector. Matthew Tukaki, executive director of the New Zealand Maori Council called the latest figures \u201cappalling\u201d and said while benefit rates needed to rise, so too did incomes for \u201cthe middle-class working poor\u201d \u2013 a point echoed by the children\u2019s commissioner. \u201cAnd let\u2019s not forget we have working whanau living in their cars with their tamariki around places like Auckland because they cannot afford the rent or even then bond and lets not talk about the fact many will never won their own homes because of the lack of being able to save because they are just trying to keep up with cost of living.\u201d Tukaki said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
