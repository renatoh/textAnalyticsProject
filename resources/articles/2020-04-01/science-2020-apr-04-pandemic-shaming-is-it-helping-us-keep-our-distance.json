LinkedIn and Facebook profiles have been removed. Death threats have been sent in their hundreds, if not thousands. And governments spurred into action. Since mid-March \u2013 when the government first recommended self-isolation measures as a way to tackle the spread of the world-altering respiratory disease Covid-19 \u2013 a public shaming frenzy has spread across social media. Thousands of people are blaming, naming, and shaming others for their improper pandemic practices; those targeted include drunk spring breakers, coughing commuters, flower markets, Stereophonics fans, and romcom screenwriter Richard Curtis\u2019s daughter. When it comes to the crime of not taking a global pandemic seriously, perhaps online shaming is the perfect punishment. After all, if you go to a packed public place or hoard paracetamol, you\u2019re endangering other people\u2019s lives. Yet is pointing the finger actually a productive way to change others\u2019 behaviour? Are we simply spreading discord at an already distressing time? At worst, are we blaming individuals for the inconsistent and confused measures implemented by the government? The term \u201ccovidiot\u201d was first uploaded to the online slang decoder Urban Dictionary on 16 March and was defined as: \u201cSomeone who ignores the warnings regarding public health or safety.\u201d On Twitter, #covidiot skyrocketed on the evening of 22 March; overnight, nearly 3,000 tweets used it to call out poor practices. That same day, Hilda \u2013 a 49-year-old who runs the Facebook and Twitter accounts for Columbia Road flower market in east London \u2013 received an influx of notifications. \u201cI\u2019m still feeling slightly traumatised by it,\u201d says Hilda, whose name has been changed on her request, after a BBC journalist tweeted a picture of the market, which appeared heavily crowded despite social distancing rules. The picture was \u201cliked\u201d nearly 4,000 times, with commenters bemoaning the \u201cstupidity\u201d of those in attendance. Hilda began to receive angry comments, tweets, emails, and phone calls complaining that the market should be shut down. To make matters worse, the social media accounts she runs are for market shopkeepers, and she had no control over whether the market as a whole opened (that decision lay with the local council). \u201cThe worst thing I had to open and read was someone saying, \u2018I hope you and your family stay healthy and alive but sadly I doubt all of them will,\u2019\u201d Hilda says. \u201cThey were very vitriolic \u2026 The world feels really dark and horrible.\u201d A day later, after newspapers splashed pictures from Columbia Road and other markets, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, branded those who visited crowded places \u201cvery selfish\u201d \u2013 that evening, new lockdown measures were put in place by the government. Yet Hilda argues that, at the time, people hadn\u2019t broken any rules. \u201cThe government advice was if you\u2019re healthy, go outside and exercise\u2026 that\u2019s what people were doing.\u201d Hilda is far from the only person to be \u201cpandemic-shamed\u201d. On 16 March, activist Scarlett Curtis uploaded an Instagram video of herself washing her hands for nearly 30 seconds, and commenters complained she used an improper technique. \u201cPlease can we not shame anyone during this hard time,\u201d she countered. \u201cNow is the time for community not judgment.\u201d Perhaps the most egregious shaming came on 18 March, when CBS News tweeted a video of American spring breakers partying in Miami. In the video, drunk students flagrantly disregard social distancing recommendations, one declaring: \u201cIf I get corona, I get corona.\u201d The video was subtitled with the full names of every student interviewed. The clip was \u201cliked\u201d more than 96,000 times and was flooded with comments berating the students\u2019 appearances and intelligence. People began tweeting the students\u2019 names and linking to their social media profiles, writing: \u201cI have a feeling the following people will have a hard time finding a job upon graduation\u201d (288 likes) and \u201cHospitals take note of these names. Do not give these selfish dumbfucks beds and/or respirators\u201d (84 likes). Some went further and contacted the students\u2019 schools, with one tweeter asking for a student\u2019s scholarship to be rescinded (the same student later deleted their Facebook page). The anger behind these messages is understandable \u2013 mass-gatherings endanger people\u2019s lives by facilitating the spread of the virus. And just three days earlier, internet shaming arguably had a productive outcome. After a Tennessee man received a barrage of angry comments for stockpiling 17,700 bottles of hand sanitiser to sell for inflated prices, he expressed remorse and donated his stock to a local church. Shaming has also been used effectively to improve employees\u2019 lives during the pandemic: after Waterstones\u2019 chief executive, James Daunt, announced its stores would be staying open, an online backlash prompted him to reverse the decision within a day. The same happened to Sports Direct, while Wetherspoon\u2019s was shamed online and off (with branches graffitied) after its chairman, Tim Martin, claimed that he couldn\u2019t afford to pay staff. A tweet calling Martin a \u201ctwat\u201d gained more than 30,000 likes, and the pay decision was reversed after he met with hospitality experts. Yet pandemic shaming can also have dire consequences. On 18 March, the Polish press reported that a professor infected with coronavirus, Wojciech Rokita, died after being flooded with hateful online comments. Rumours had spread \u2013 both online and in local media \u2013 that 54-year-old Rokita had not complied with his quarantine and had visited a car showroom after being diagnosed with coronavirus. On 19 March, a lawyer representing Rokita\u2019s family claimed the professor had not violated his quarantine, and had taken his own life as a result of the \u201cwave of hate\u201d he faced online. The story of the remorseful Tennessee hoarder is also less uplifting on second glance. The New York Times reported that the man received hate mail and death threats, with one stranger banging on his door late at night. \u201cYour behaviour is probably going to end up with someone killing you and your wife and your children,\u201d read one email. The man has also lost his livelihood \u2013 he is now banned from selling on eBay and Amazon, previously his sole form of income. It is hardly surprising that online shaming can have tragic consequences, but when it comes to coronavirus, you could argue that shamers endanger one person in order to save many more. Yet do the shamed actually change their minds as a result of hateful comments? Is shaming actually productive? \u201cWhat they were saying was absolutely outrageous,\u201d says Laura, a 17-year-old who received online hate after attending a Stereophonics gig in Manchester on 13 March (her name has been changed on her request). Laura emphasises that when she attended the concert, mass gatherings hadn\u2019t been banned by the government (although some artists had cancelled their gigs). \u201cI had people telling me I was going to kill people, someone private messaged me saying, \u2018I hope you feel great about yourself when you\u2019re the one who\u2019s killed your whole family,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t change my mind, they didn\u2019t make me regret that I went,\u201d Laura goes on. She received the comments on a tweet she posted after the gig, and therefore notes: \u201cWhat they were saying was irrelevant because what had happened had already been and gone, so they couldn\u2019t have stopped me from going.\u201d Three days earlier, 24-year-old Jardin May from Texas received a flood of comments after tweeting, \u201cCoronavirus is everywhere. BOOK THAT FLIGHT. Take that trip. You probably won\u2019t die from it, but even if you do \u2026 You wanna die with the Eiffel Tower in the background \u2026\u201d May says some commenters educated her about coronavirus \u2013 those who were calm and polite taught her that she shouldn\u2019t be concerned about herself, but rather the elderly and vulnerable people she might infect. \u201cA lot of the stuff I know about coronavirus I didn\u2019t learn till the calmer people in the comments were like, \u2018Hey, just be careful\u2019,\u201d May says. \u201cBut Twitter took it and ran with it.\u201d A fortnight later, May is still receiving notifications from the tweet, and she is continually being branded \u201cfucking stupid and selfish\u201d, a \u201cbitch\u201d, \u201cmurderer\u201d, and a \u201cmoron\u201d. \u201cThey were extremely aggressive, they were like, \u2018Oh I hope your family dies\u2019; \u2018I hope you get sick and you die from it,\u2019\u201d May says of the initial messages she received. \u201cI did feel like a lot of people were wasting their breath, because if you\u2019re doing angry tweeting and cursing and threats, I\u2019m not gonna read it.\u201d The venom generated hasn\u2019t prevented the state from adopting online shaming during the coronavirus crisis. While individuals use it to police behaviour, now the actual police are using it to denounce members of the public. On 27 March, Derbyshire police released drone footage which labelled anonymous dog walkers and exercisers on the Peaks as indulging in outlawed \u201cnot essential\u201d travel. The former justice secretary, David Gauke, described the shaming as \u201cbadly misjudged\u201d. And last Sunday (29 March) after tweeting a photo of his physically distanced birthday visit to his father Neil, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock was criticised by the South Wales police Twitter account \u2013 \u201cA lovely thing to do, however this is not essential travel.\u201d When Kinnock replied pointing out he had been delivering \u201cnecessary supplies\u201d, the force thanked him for the \u201cclarification\u201d. The Twittersphere was divided over whether this was a good use of police time. Dr June Tangney, a psychology professor at George Mason University, and author of Shame and Guilt, doubts shaming will prevent poor pandemic behaviour. \u201cBy shaming people, we\u2019re actually encouraging the opposite,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen people feel shamed, they tend to get very defensive, they tend to blame other people, they\u2019re disinclined to take responsibility, and they\u2019re not any more likely to change their behaviour.\u201d So why are we really shaming others during a pandemic? Dr Lydia Woodyatt is a social sciences professor at Flinders University whose research has shown that schadenfreude motivates online shaming. \u201cThe same things that drive hostility and collective action offline can drive shaming behaviour online: anger, identification with others in the cause, schadenfreude, belief that our actions together will make a difference,\u201d she explains. She points to recent research by PhD students at her university which found that when an online leader emphasises the nobility of the \u201cgoal\u201d of their shaming, people are more likely to shame. You\u2019d struggle to find a more noble goal than saving lives, so it makes sense that there\u2019s been an increase in shaming in recent weeks. Yet Woodyatt also points to a simpler explanation \u2013 with social isolation increasingly common, more and more people are online for longer stretches of time, and this is an issue that encompasses the entire world. \u201cThe sense of loss of control can mean that people try and take control of what they feel they can control,\u201d she adds. Schadenfreude and a bit of boredom might explain the reaction to a tweet posted by nightclub owner Fraser Carruthers on 16 March. Responding to Boris Johnson\u2019s recommendation that the public stop visiting pubs, Carruthers tweeted: \u201cI am a nightclub owner in Kensington and Chelsea. You can\u2019t tell the nation to avoid \u2018pubs and clubs\u2019 and not officially \u2018close us\u2019 so that we can claim our insurance.\u201d When online sleuths discovered that he had previously tweeted \u201cAnyone but Corbyn\u201d, they mocked the 37-year-old as deserving of his fate. \u201cIt was a mind-blowing response,\u201d says Carruthers, who says he had \u201chundreds and hundreds\u201d of messages for \u201cthree days non-stop\u201d. He was particularly alarmed by commenters who wished he and his family would end up on the street. \u201cIt really makes you think there are some horrible people in this world.\u201d Carruthers believes the response was so strong because of the \u201cstigma\u201d of Kensington and Chelsea, but notes he didn\u2019t actually vote Conservative in the 2019 election \u2013 he voted for the Animal Welfare party. Of course, in the middle of a global pandemic, nightclub owners aren\u2019t the people we should feel sorriest for. Yet the vitriol Carruthers received demonstrates that online shaming isn\u2019t always altruistic. Dr Aaron Balick, a psychotherapist from London and author of The Psychodynamics of Social Networking, argues that online shamers are \u201chardly doing it for the safety of society. They\u2019re doing it because they get to be right and someone else gets to be wrong.\u201d Balick says pandemic shaming may be caused by fear, as \u201cpeople tend to regress when they\u2019re frightened\u201d. Yet like Tangney, he believes shaming is counterproductive and potentially dangerous. \u201cShame is one of our most primitive feelings. It does hurt, very, very deeply, and if it happens on a grand scale, like on Twitter, it can be psychologically traumatic,\u201d he says. Arguably, the repercussions of online shaming aren\u2019t as severe as they were five years ago, when journalist Jon Ronson wrote his book So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed, chronicling the trauma, job losses, and damaged lives of the internet-shamed. Nowadays, trending topics move so quickly that it is difficult for one individual to capture the entire internet\u2019s attention for long. Even actor Vanessa Hudgens, who employed her best vocal fry to say, \u201cLike yeah, people are going to die, which is terrible \u2026 but inevitable?\u201d on Instagram on 16 March, got away relatively unscathed. Though Hudgens was flooded with hate and forced to issue an apology, model Chrissy Teigen came to her defence and gained 75,000 likes for tweeting that when people make misjudged comments, \u201cu don\u2019t have [to] ruin their lives\u201d. And indeed, if we now know the consequences of online shaming, we should also know the consequences of what we post online. May, the tweeter who encouraged people to book cheap flights, says she doesn\u2019t think the backlash was unfair because she was aware that \u201cthis is the internet\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s open for everyone to leave their opinion\u201d. It is also possible that while shaming doesn\u2019t change the behaviour of the shamed, it can adjust cultural norms. An anonymous 27-year-old says that seeing others hectored online changed his own habits. \u201cIn general it just made me take it way more seriously,\u201d he says, explaining that he had initially still planned to go on holiday and had a \u201ccavalier\u201d attitude to the dangers. \u201cOnline hectoring [of others] did force me to see that behaviour as selfish and individualistic \u2026 perhaps more than straight up relaying that information in a calm and dispassionate way would have done.\u201d Yet overall, the experts do not believe in the power of public shame. \u201cBy increasing hostility in an otherwise volatile environment we are just promoting the norm of hostility and aggression as a means of coping,\u201d Woodyatt says. \u201cI think we should all agree that is not a good idea. Humans can communicate social norms in calm and non-aggressive ways. We are all in this together.\u201d Jon Ronson, too, is not a fan of pandemic shaming (though he notes that we can and should criticise public figures who are putting people in danger). \u201cAs we\u2019re forced to isolate,\u201d he says, \u201cwe need to be able to connect with other people. It can make the difference between being happy and stoical and being depressed. The very best thing Twitter could be right now is a nice place for people to visit and find connection.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is 0808 2000 247. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is 1800 737 732. In the US, the suicide prevention lifeline is 1-800-273-8255 and the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).
