The 50-signature letter was submitted for publication by the campaign group Yes to Fairer Votes. The group now says that the signature list was submitted in error; most had not given permission for their names to be used. Among the small sample of five names published in the newspaper, for instance, the following three should not have been listed: Alexandra Shulman, editor of Vogue; Gillian Slovo, author, and Josie Long, comedian. This correction is also being added to the online version of the letter, where the full list of 50 names originally appeared; at the same time, a new list of 18 agreed signatories will be inserted in the online version (Our only chance to achieve fairer votes, 28 April, page 35). \u2022 Kate Middleton was said in a piece to be the likely future Queen of England (Meet the bride and groom, 27 April, page 2, G2). In an earlier edition, this also appeared: \"Even George W Bush, who tried to portray himself as a homespun Texas rancher, would put on white tie and tails when banqueting with the Queen of England\" (Cameron has spent years trying to play down his privileged background ..., 22 April, page 5, G2). But Elizabeth II is monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
