The virus was found when Millar underwent routine blood tests recently as part of health screening carried out by the French Cycling Federation, and further tests by his team Cofidis confirmed the spread of the illness. \"The virus count is huge - I've got a major virus in my bloodstream,\" said the 25-year-old Scot yesterday. \"Fortunately I haven't been training too hard, so it hasn't done much damage. I'm just generally shattered at the moment.\" Professional cyclists seem particularly susceptible to glandular fever, probably because of the strain that the high-mileage sport puts on their immune systems. The illness, which can take months to recover from, comes after Millar's best season, in which he rose to 16th in the world rankings, winning a silver medal in the world time-trial championship and two stages of the Tour of Spain. Together with the Tour de France, in which he wore the yellow jersey in 2000, the Vuelta and the world title were his targets for this year. Millar was scheduled to begin racing in the Tour of Murcia on March 10, but that is now rated unlikely. \"I have to stay as far away from cycling as possible for a couple of weeks so I don't get depressed - and don't get tempted to train,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
