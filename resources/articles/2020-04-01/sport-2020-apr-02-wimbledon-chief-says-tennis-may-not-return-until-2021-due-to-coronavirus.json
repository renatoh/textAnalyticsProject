Speaking the day after the All England Club finally cancelled the championships for the first time since the second world war, Lewis acknowledged that uncertainty has gripped tennis because of the continued spread of coronavirus. \u201cWho knows what will happen over that period?\u201d he said on Thursday of the summer to come. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge for everybody. Let\u2019s hope the US Open and Roland Garros [rescheduled to start a week after the conclusion of the US Open] can take place. It would be genuinely wonderful if the sport was off and running again. \u201cThe optimist in me \u2013 and I am often not optimistic \u2013 still hopes the American hard-court season, the big tournaments, the Masters and the Premiers, will take place: Montreal, Toronto and then Cincinnati. But we all know that\u2019s probably tenuous at the moment. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unrealistic to say that there may be no more tennis this year. But I would like to think that things will settle down so that tournaments can be played sooner rather than later.\u201d Lewis, who quits at the end of July after running the tournament for eight years to make way for Sally Bolton, also hopes the former champions Roger Federer and Serena Williams, who hold 15 Wimbledon titles between them, can play when the championships resume in the summer of 2021. \u201cWe\u2019d love to see both of them back. It\u2019s something to look forward to, and we\u2019ll hopefully enjoy it all the more, a silver lining to come out of it.\u201d When news broke that the 134th edition of the championships would have to be abandoned, the former British No 1 Annabel Croft described the dilemma for Federer and Williams as \u201ca nightmare\u201d. The Swiss, recovering from knee surgery, is on a record 20 majors, one ahead of Rafael Nadal and three in front of Novak Djokovic, while Williams remains one short of Margaret Court\u2019s all-time record of 24 grand slam titles. Both are 38 years old and their chances of returning to the game after an extended absence depend on their fitness and continued enthusiasm. Also unknown is how much of a hole cancellation will put in an estimated \u00a3250m revenue at Wimbledon. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to have the insurance and it helps,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe insurers, the brokers and everybody involved have been excellent to work with so far, but there\u2019s still a lot of work to do.\u201d He said the annual windfall from that which goes to the Lawn Tennis Association, estimated at more than \u00a340m, should be safe. \u201cThe insurance will help protect the surplus to a large extent. The details and the figure probably won\u2019t be known for months.\u201d These are all daunting challenges for Bolton, the first woman to hold the club\u2019s chief executive job, although Nora Cleather was the acting secretary during the second world war. The surreal atmosphere and circumstances in the year of the virus might well feel like those of 1939-45 for Bolton, a widely respected sports administrator for more than 25 years, having worked in both rugby codes, athletics, and as head of corporate affairs at the All England Club since 2016."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
