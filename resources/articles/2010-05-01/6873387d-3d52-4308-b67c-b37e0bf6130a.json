The England manager will be at Arsenal's last game of the season against the Europa League finalists Fulham hoping to see evidence of Walcott's recent encouraging form and, fitness permitting, Zamora's bite in front of goal, though it is Campbell's resurgence that will draw his focus in particular. Although the 35-year-old would be a surprise inclusion in Capello's provisional 30-man squad, to be submitted to Fifa next Tuesday, England's concerns at centre-half have potentially put the veteran back into contention. There are serious doubts within the England set-up over Rio Ferdinand's fitness \u2013 Capello's captain has started only 11 Premier League games for Manchester United this season after back and related groin complaints \u2013 while Joleon Lescott and Wes Brown, sidelined recently by hamstring and foot injuries respectively, will struggle to make the provisional squad, which will depart on 17 May for an initial training camp to be held at altitude in Austria. The Tottenham Hotspur pair of Ledley King and the uncapped Michael Dawson should gain inclusion despite the former's well-documented knee condition, with Everton's Phil Jagielka also under consideration, though Campbell's recent form, which will earn him a contract at Arsenal for next season, has also not gone unnoticed. \"My name has definitely moved up the list, for sure,\" said the defender, who boasts 73 caps. \"I've got a chance. Whether it's enough, I don't know. If he gives me the nod, I'll definitely give it my all. I'm experienced, I'm playing fantastically well, and I'm focused and ready. But if it doesn't happen, I'll accept it.\" Campbell has not featured for England since the defeat to Croatia in November 2007 in Steve McClaren's final game in charge, since when he spent a brief spell in League Two with Notts County. However his current form and fitness, as well as his vast experience, would stand him in good stead, with Capello still considering how much of a risk it would constitute to take both Ferdinand, with his recent lack of games and fitness, and King \u2013 who is generally unable to play twice in a week with his knee condition \u2013 to South Africa. England's medical staff remain in constant dialogue with their counterparts at United and Tottenham as they seek to clarify each player's prospects. \"When I was a club manager I would speak with the doctor to see who would start and who would be on the bench or not fit,\" Capello said at a Q&amp;A event organised by sponsors Nationwide. \"Here it is the same. I speak with the players and also the medical staff to see who is fit. If they are not fit they will stay at home because I prefer a fit player to one who is not fit, unless it is a small injury. The doctor might say in two or three days this player can be fit, but if it is two weeks, then no. \"We will wait to choose the first list of 30 players and then the final 23 for the squad. I don't know what will happen. Some players might miss two games, some will be injured and some will be fit. I hope that the best players will be fit for the World Cup because without good players it's impossible.\" If Campbell is still considered an outsider to make the squad, then the same must be said of Zamora despite the uncapped forward's superb goalscoring record in Fulham's unlikely European run this season. The 29-year-old is currently troubled by an achilles injury which will keep him out of this evening's visit of Stoke City to Craven Cottage, though he would hope to play some part in Sunday's derby to prove his fitness ahead of the midweek game against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in Hamburg. Capello's general manager, Franco Baldini, has also decided against visiting Stamford Bridge or Old Trafford on Sunday and will attend West Ham's final game at home to Manchester City, with Robert Green, Matthew Upson and Carlton Cole all to be assessed, as well as the visitors' young winger Adam Johnson. Capello recently pinpointed the 22-year-old as a potential late contender for his squad for South Africa. \"He has come up from the Championship and he has done well,\" the Italian said of the player who left Middlesbrough in January. \"Now it's important he gets some international experience.\" That time on the pitch could come in this month's friendlies against Mexico at Wembley on 24 May and Japan in Graz, Austria, on 30 May. Johnson was in the provisional 30-man squad for the friendly against Egypt in March and has maintained his excellent form since returning to the top flight, establishing himself in the City first team and gaining more time on the pitch than, for example, his club-mate and potential international rival Shaun Wright-Phillips."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
