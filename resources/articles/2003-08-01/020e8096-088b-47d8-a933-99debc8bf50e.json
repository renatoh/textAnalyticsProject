The rally, organised by Sinn F\u00e9in, is part of a campaign to highlight the collusion between the British Government, its security forces and loyalist paramilitaries that has been pointed up by British police chief John Stevens. The purpose of the campaign is not only to turn the spotlight on any relationship between the British Army and loyalist death squads, but to uncover the truth or otherwise of the British Government's alleged involvement in sanctioning state killings at the highest levels. The rally will be lead by relatives and friends of those killed by the UDA, LVF and UVF during the last 30 years. These killings were not the work of sectarian killers acting alone, but, it is argued, the result of a concerted British policy which provided loyalists with information, weapons and police cover to kill civilians, IRA volunteers, Sinn F\u00e9in elected representatives and activists. The demand of the campaign is a simple one, truth. Both the families of those killed, and indeed society in general has a right to hear from the current British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, about the extent of political sanction for this policy. Sinn F\u00e9in has long argued that collusion is part of the apparatus of repression used by successive British governments in Ireland. We believe that during the 1980s, military intelligence agencies put in place a strategy of state-sponsored murder. Loyalist paramilitaries were directed by agents such as Brian Nelson and in 1987 armed with weapons imported from South Africa with the full knowledge of military intelligence. In the six years prior to 1987, some 71 people were killed by loyalists. In the same period after the importation of weapons from South Africa that figure rose to 229. In addition to random Catholic civilian targets, the newly reorganised loyalist murder gangs killed Sinn F\u00e9in representatives such as Eddie Fullerton, John Davey and Bernard O'Hagan. They were also responsible for the murder of human rights lawyers Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson. In Belfast today, many will be thinking of Sean Lavery, killed on 8 August 1990, after the first ever march by Sinn F\u00e9in into the city centre. His murder, it is argued, was just another part of the machinery of collusion aimed at intimidating a community struggling for our rights. On 17 April this year, after 14 years and three enquiries, John Stevens admitted what we all knew for decades - that there had been systematic collusion between the forces of the state and loyalist death squads. Just consider the gravity of this admission. The state had been involved in the murder of its citizens. If this happened in South America or Africa, the British press would be outraged and demand action. One only need think of recent events in Zimbabwe. But it happened here in Ireland and the silence is deafening. These governments did not fall, their premiers were not indicted for human rights abuses, and indeed the shadowy figures behind the politicians continue to undermine the relations between Britain and Ireland and the peace process. For many Irish nationalists the pursuit of General Pinochet for human rights abuses in Chile should also have happened to Margaret Thatcher. It is important to point out that not a single member of RUC Special Branch nor British military intelligence has ever been indicted for these crimes. No politician has been held accountable. The policy of collusion highlighted by Stevens remains intact and the British agencies, which executed this policy, remain in place. To add insult to the injury of the families who lost loved ones at the hands of this policy, the British Gov ernment has made more than 100 gallantry awards to the faceless securocrats who controlled and directed the loyalist death squads. And so today in Belfast the families, friends and supporters of these victims are demanding justice. We are demanding that the truth be told by the British Prime Minister. Almost a year ago, Tony Blair, in a key-note address made after the collapse of the Stormont Assembly, called for acts of completion by republicans. His demand was justified in terms of republicans making moves which would demonstrate our commitment to peaceful and democratic politics. While the irony of his words may have been lost on a British audience, it was certainly apparent here in Ireland. If we are truly to build a new democratic and peaceful society, then acts of completion are required on all sides, and no less so of the British political establishment, who for 30 years, according to Stevens, resourced and directed illegal loyalist armed gangs to kill its own citizens. If Tony Blair is genuine about in acts of completion collusion would be a good place to start. Eoin O'Broin is a Sinn Fein councillor in Belfast.
