TMZ reported that Vincent had a heart attack last week and died Wednesday during open-heart surgery at a hospital in New Jersey. Vincent was known not just for his role on The Sopranos, where through seven seasons his character rose to become the boss of the Lupertazzi crime family, but also for his roles in the Scorsese-directed films Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Casino. Most recently, Vincent appeared in an episode of Law &amp; Order: SVU. Last year, he was also the voice of Jon Gabagooli in the animated series Mr Pickles. Vincent, who was born in North Adams, Massachusetts, and raised in Jersey City, co-wrote a book in 2006 called A Guy\u2019s Guide to Being a Man\u2019s Man; James Gandolfini, who passed away in 2013 and was Vincent\u2019s co-star on the Sopranos, wrote the foreword. The Blast reports that another of Vincent\u2019s peers, the actor Vincent Pastore, sent an email to friends after hearing news of his friend\u2019s death: \u201cI just received a phone call that Frank Vincent has passed away \u2026 I\u2019ll let all know about the services \u2026 We lost a great character actor and great man ... May he always stay in our memory.\u201d Maureen Van Zandt, who played Gabriella Dante on The Sopranos, expressed her condolences on Twitter. \u201cWe lost one of our family today,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFrank Vincent. Wonderful actor and lovely man. Rest In Peace, Frankie.\u201d The CNN newscaster Jake Tapper also shared his condolences via Twitter, referencing Vincent\u2019s most famous line as Billy Batts in the 1990 film Goodfellas: \u201cNow go home and get your shinebox.\u201d In 2006, Vincent gave an interview to Ask Men on the heels of his book release. \u201cThe youth of today are so computerized and individualized that a lot of the stuff men used to know is lost on them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about: loyalty, respect, manners, and honor. You have got to have a good sense of humor, you have got to be tough and you have got to know how to dress.\u201d This piece was amended on 14 September 2017. The Guardian originally gave his age as 78, but a statement from his family clarified that he was 80 when he died."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
