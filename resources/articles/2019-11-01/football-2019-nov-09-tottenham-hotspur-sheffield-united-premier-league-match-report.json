After Wednesday\u2019s 4-0 victory over Red Star Belgrade came a result and a performance to suggest that all remains unwell with Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s men. They were outfought and outplayed by a Sheffield United side who left north London with much to cherish but also a sense of injustice given this proved to be another occasion when VAR made its presence felt in maddening fashion. The visitors thought they had cancelled out Son Heung-min\u2019s 58th-minute goal when, on the hour, David McGoldrick converted Enda Stevens\u2019 cross at the back post. There appeared nothing wrong with the strike but then came that now common uncertainty and dread. Referee Graham Scott had his finger to his ear, the large screen said the goal was being checked by VAR and then, after a delay of 3mins 47secs, came the verdict \u2013 no goal. Why? Because Jonathan Moss, the VAR located at Stockley Park, deemed John Lundstram\u2019s big toe had been offside in the build-up. Yes \u2013 big toe. Or perhaps it was his right arm. Frankly it was hard to tell given the lines that were drawn on the VAR-related footage of the incident and while the decision may have been correct it ultimately did little to take away from the feeling that rather than improving football in this country, the technology is leading to its slow death. Firstly, it was not clear that any part of Lundstram\u2019s body was ahead of Eric Dier \u2013 the last man. On the image tweeted from the Premier League\u2019s official account, Dier\u2019s left shoulder and knee appeared to be playing the midfielder onside as he collected a pass on the right flank. And even if they were not, should the goal have been disallowed given the phases of play that followed Lundstram\u2019s eventual cross, namely Dier\u2019s clearing header, John Fleck\u2019s pass to Stevens on the left and, finally, his delivery to McGoldrick? All in all it was a mess \u2013 neither a \u201cclear and obvious\u201d error on the assistant referee\u2019s part and, given the long delay, another use of VAR that temporarily but most definitely sucked the life out of what was an absorbing encounter. Chris Wilder was phlegmatic in the aftermath but having been among the Premier League managers who met with Mike Riley, manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), on Thursday to discuss VAR, he also expressed confusion over what would have been McGoldrick\u2019s first Premier League goal. \u201cWhen is the reset?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s gone down the right, John\u2019s crossed it, it\u2019s come back out and we\u2019ve then attacked down the left. So where does it reset to go again? That\u2019s not clear. That length of the stoppage also doesn\u2019t do anybody any good. It affects the game and that\u2019s a disappointing aspect of it.\u201d Asked if he was tired of talking about VAR, Wilder replied: \u201c100%\u201d. Instead he was keen to praise his side for their display here, and rightly so. The visitors were excellent throughout, playing with typical resilience in defence and fearlessness in attack and, ultimately, it was only right that they did equalise on 78 minutes when George Baldock\u2019s cross evaded everyone and landed in the the net. And yes, it was also subject to a VAR check. The draw means United remain undefeated away from home since their return to the top flight. That is some going for a side tipped at the start of the campaign to make an immediate return to the Championship and they would have taken even more from this game had McGoldrick\u2019s goal stood or Lundstram, who was outstanding throughout, been more clinical with a couple of chances in the first half. For Tottenham this really was a bump back to earth after their impressive showing in midweek. Nine of the players who started in Belgrade also did here but, unlike then, they lacked cohesion and fluidity. Passes regularly went astray while in defence the hosts looked uncertain. Even Son\u2019s goal \u2013 his eighth of the season \u2013 was fortunate given the South Korean was only able to strike the ball through Dean Henderson\u2019s legs because of a loose backpass by Stevens. It is now five Premier League games without victory for Spurs and, on this evidence, their form is not necessarily going to improve after the international break. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t win you are disappointed,\u201d said Pochettino, who could also be without Tanguy Ndombele for some time after the midfielder was withdrawn at half-time with a suspected groin injury. \u201cWe did not start well and when you assess the game, a draw was fair.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
