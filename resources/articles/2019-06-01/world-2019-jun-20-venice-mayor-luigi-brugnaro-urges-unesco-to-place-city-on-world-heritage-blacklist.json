Luigi Brugnaro\u2019s frustration has been brewing since a huge vessel crashed into a tourist boat on the canal in early June, injuring four people. \u201cWe will write to Unesco to ask for the city to be put on the blacklist,\u201d he told Radio 24. \u201cVenice is in danger and we feel in danger.\u201d Brugnaro said the city had no faith in the government, and felt particularly let down by the transport minister, Danilo Toninelli, who has rejected a plan agreed by Italy\u2019s previous administration that would have closed off the canal to cruise ships. After the crash, which provoked more protests against cruise ships in the lagoon, Toninelli said a solution would be announced soon. Toninelli, a member of the Five Star Movement, which often fights against major infrastructure projects, visited the city last week \u2013 by helicopter. A source at the local authority said he did not meet the city\u2019s leaders to discuss the original plan or his alternative proposals, which include building a new cruise ship terminal at either the Lido San Nicol\u00f2 or in Chioggia, a coastal town south of Venice. Toninelli has suggested putting the options to a referendum on his party\u2019s online platform, Rousseau, which it often uses to craft policy. \u201cHe has an arrogance that I have not seen in my life,\u201d Brugnaro said. \u201cWe do not so much contest that the minister has a different idea to ours, and if he told us that would be nice, but in the meantime he is making [other] proposals to move the ships from St Mark\u2019s Square.\u201d Unesco originally gave authorities until 2017 to undertake measures to protect Venice\u2019s monuments and preserve its fragile environment, or risk the city being put on its endangered world heritage list. That deadline was extended by a year, and again until 2021 as leaders showed encouraging signs of making improvements in terms of managing the tourism flow. Their most crucial task, however, was to come up with a plan to divert cruise ships. The project agreed in 2017 foresaw those weighing more than 96,000 tonnes entering the lagoon via the Malamocco canal to reach the mainland area of Marghera, where a passenger terminal would be built. Medium-sized vessels would go past Marghera and take the longer route through the Vittorio Emanuele canal before reaching the Marittima terminal, where cruise liners currently dock."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
