Their study says the department's plans to boost the capability of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to analyse the internet activities of all British citizens will work only if new laws are passed. The authors also raise concerns over the Home Office claim that the proposals are needed to \"maintain\" interception amid rapidly changing technology; the study says that favours state power over individuals' privacy rights. In April, the former home secretary Jacqui Smith announced a consultation over plans to require communication service providers, such as BT, to retain for 12 months details on all personal communications data. Professor Peter Sommer, of the LSE, said: \"With internet technology you have to collect everything then throw away what the law does not allow you to have. We think \u2026 that distinction will be impossible to interpret.\" He said the proposals went beyond maintaining capabilities of the law enforcement agencies. A Home Office spokesman said the data helped tackle serious crimes; there was a fine balance between protecting safety and civil liberties, and it would ensure \"stringent safeguards\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
