Yet amid all the fear and horror, there is one silver lining, as we reconnect with nature on our doorstep. My Somerset garden is awash with birdsong: chiffchaffs, wrens, robins and a new arrival, the blackcap, all competing to see who can shout the loudest as spring gathers pace. Overhead, buzzards soar and ravens tumble, as delighted as I am to herald the new season. But to hear a bird whose song is the definitive sound of the countryside, I must take my daily exercise: a walk with our fox-red labrador Rosie around Blackford Moor, the little patch of land behind our home. I\u2019ve seen some memorable birds here over the years, not least a female marsh harrier passing through on migration, just a week or so ago. But as with any local patch, it\u2019s all about the commonplace; and here, and especially now, the ubiquitous bird is the skylark. A plump, triangular-winged shape rises up from the lane in front of us, then rapidly gains height, while continuing to deliver an outpouring of song: a rapid jumble of notes that seems to go on forever, even when the bird vanishes into the ether. As the dog and I stand and watch, I feel a new book coming on: \u201cSkylarks with Rosie\u201d?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
