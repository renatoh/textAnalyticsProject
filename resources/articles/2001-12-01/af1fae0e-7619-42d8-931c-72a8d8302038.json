Although they had been held up by Jacques Kallis, who batted unbeaten throughout the day for 65, and some unlikely resistance from two first-rate bunnies Makhaya Ntini and Nantie Hayward, it was little more than an irritant. Eventually Ntini was yorked off his boot by Brett Lee, Hayward swished to be caught at the wicket off the same bowler, and that was that. Otherwise it had been quick and ruthless, precisely the sort of performance that the cricket world has come to expect from the Australians. Notionally chasing 375 to win and two down for spit overnight, the South Africans lost a couple more wickets before the day's fifth over was out, and their eighth immediately after lunch for 78. The game was well and truly up by then, for the bowling had been compelling. Glenn McGrath finished with three for 13 from 14 overs of unrelenting probing, Jason Gillespie and Lee took a pair apiece, and Shane Warne, twirling away through 29 straight overs until tail-end stubbornness demanded the recall of the heavy artillery, three for 57, giving him match figures of eight for 170. With his rapid first-innings 40 and a pair of stinging catches at first slip yesterday there was never much doubt that Warne was the man of a match in which every single Australian contributed. \"A monumental performance,\" said their captain Steve Waugh afterwards. South Africa had been bowled out for 128 which, given that they had never been dismissed in double figures since their return to Test cricket and had looked odds on to do so here, was a minor triumph. But it is their third lowest total in that 89-match period. And if the defeat, by 246 runs, was not as heavy as their 280-run hammering in Kanpur five years ago, it was still the fifth largest runs' margin in their history at a time when they had spoken boldly - a little too boldly perhaps - of victory. This places their performance and consequent standing in world cricket in context. Waugh rightly suggested that his side should be talked up for their resilience, strength of character and desire rather than a focus placed on South African deficiency. Just as with England, and others of course, defeat at the hands of Australia does not make them a bad side. But the notion, generated by the ICC's ridiculous Test championship table, that a drawn series would put South Africa at the top of the tree is laughable. They are a worthy side, with a number of world-class players. But that is true of most teams. Shaun Pollock talked afterwards of how his team know that, if they play their best, they can beat Australia. Yet that is the mantra of all defeated captains. The fact is that Australia have the knack of raising their game when the stakes are highest, of winning the big points. They do not allow the opposition the luxury of maximising their potential. Technically, and psychologically on the evidence here at least, South Africa are not on the same block. And Australia have Warne, the disappearance of whom one day will be the chief factor in pulling the rest of the world closer to Australia. His capture of Gary Kirsten with the final ball of the fourth day was a massive lift, dispensing with the one batsman capable of saving the game. Survival thereafter, with the ball spinning wickedly out of the rough if not so much from other areas of the pitch, was always going to be a huge test. There was uneven bounce for the seamers, though, and it was McGrath who set the ball rolling when, in the day's fifth over, he had Boeta Dippenaar edging low to Warne. Two balls later he had Neil McKenzie given out by the visiting umpire Venkat as he offered no shot to a ball that kept low. Kallis and Lance Klusener then put on 33, causing Waugh to replace McGrath with Gillespie to almost immediate effect as Klusener was caught by Warne. Mark Boucher fol lowed in Gillespie's next over, caught down the leg-side, and South Africa were 58 for six. All this time Warne was probing. Pollock succumbed, turned inside out as he edged a sharp pad-bat chance to Ricky Ponting. A similar fate awaited Claude Henderson. If Ntini had been run out, as he should have been, before scoring, embarrassment would have been complete. But he resisted for more than an hour as Kallis completed his half-century, and Hayward for another 37 minutes. It was a forthright statement to team-mates.
