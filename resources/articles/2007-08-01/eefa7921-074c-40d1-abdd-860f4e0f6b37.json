And again and again and again and ...", "bodyText": "Matt Damon's Jason Bourne cinema trilogy (The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum) is now set to become the most lucrative film franchise ever. It comes as no surprise then that another 14 sequels have already been shot. In yet another exclusive, I can now reveal what they are and what they're about. So, over the next decade look out for: The Airbourne Polonium: Jason Bourne has just two hours to stop a Russian assassin without getting cancer. This is followed up with The Bourne Endoscopy. The Bourne Accordion: Jason Bourne thinks he's a busker. The Bourne Pandemonium: Jason Bourne has 10 minutes to crack a secret code in a room of 3,000 children. The Misbourne Conspiracy: Jason Bourne has 15 minutes to stop the River Misbourne in Buckinghamshire from bursting its banks. The Bourne Londinium: Matt Damon plays an ancient amnesiac spy accused of being involved in the plot to assassinate Caesar. The Bourneville Conundrum: Jason Bourne has six minutes to find a bar of Cadbury's chocolate that doesn't have salmonella. The Bourne Utility: Matt Damon has become so rich thanks to the Jason Bourne series of films that he now purchases all of the world's supplies of natural gas. The Bourne Condominium: Jason Bourne has 20 years to retire to sheltered accommodation for spies. The Bourne Linoleum: Matt Damon doesn't do a Bourne film as he has four working days to wait at home for new flooring. The Ayckbourn Tumescence: Jason Bourne has 14 hours to make Alan Ayckbourn feel erotic. The Bourne Hostility: People start getting tired of the Bourne sequence and think of a way to get rid of Matt Damon, or at least frighten him. The Bourne Opprobrium: Matt Damon receives a dead lama in the post. The Bourne Atrocity: The Bourne franchise ends to everyone's satisfaction. Fact: God does do irony I love astronomy, but am the world's laziest astronomer; in theory, I like star-gazing, but hate being up after 11pm. At least I'm not as lazy as Queen guitarist Brian May. Nine days ago, he handed in his astrophysics doctorate 30 years late, and so can now have the haircut he bet a fellow student 30 years ago he wouldn't have until he finished. Mr May and I love astronomy because astrophysical facts are always truly astounding. For example, according to nuclear physicist Jim al-Khalili on BBC Four's Atom, each one of us is actually hotter than the sun; i.e. if the sun were shrunk to the size of a man, it would actually give off less heat than an average-sized human being. This fact unfortunately validates the hypothesis that if George Galloway were sufficiently enlarged, he could legitimately claim that the sun effectively shone out of his arse. But the most wonderful fact about space, the one that's sent me drooling in an ecstasy of mysticism, I discovered only last month listening in the night to a radio programme about space (it was after 11pm, so I was in bed). Ever since I heard this fact, the whole of time and space, the very purpose of our existence on this spinning ball of land and fish, has changed and has now confirmed my profound belief that all of us were only created for someone else's amusement. And that fact is this: when stars near the end of their life, they consume themselves in blazing infernos known as white and red dwarfs. When these dwarf stars finally run out of fuel, they collapse in on themselves and fuse all their remaining helium into carbon. Under searing temperatures of 100,000 degrees, the carbon is organised into its most compact form. It then takes billions and billions of years to cool down completely. And when it does, it's a diamond. A crystal diamond the size of earth. Imagine that. When the universe ends, space will be full of massive diamonds. And none of us will be around to see them. God, it seems, is into irony. In a big way. For what everything's been working up to is a massive blingiverse. And no one will be alive to steal it or put it on eBay. Think of that if any of you are heading off to church this morning. Wear lots of jewellery and flaunt it at Him. Where's Brown the baboon? The one absolute and unquestioned fact we were all being presented with before Gordon Brown entered Number 10 was that he was truly crazy. Massed ranks of Blairite loyalists and most of the media conspired to guarantee us that Brown was a half-drooling manbeast as mad as 50 March hares drowning in a lagoon of mercury and incapable of even walking properly. We were led to expect some subhuman baboon who staggered about haphazardly like a new-born foal, maybe banging into walls instead of trying doors. The truth has surprised many. Brown has now received many plaudits for being able to walk quite normally, as well as the statesman-like way he is able to sit, stand, dress and chew like any human without swallowing his own tongue. Maybe, out of embarrassment for being caught out by their previous distortions, the media have now overdone their praise for the man, crediting him with superhuman powers that enabled him to harness the Moon's gravitational pull on Earth to make the floods recede and to stop bombs going off by appearing calm. Whatever the truth, I'm left with a suspicion that the last few years of Blair's reign were spent with a lot of responsible grown-ups perpetrating a distortion as bad as any on Blue Peter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
