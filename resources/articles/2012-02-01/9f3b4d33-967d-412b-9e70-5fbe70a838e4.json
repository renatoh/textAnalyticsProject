In her first major speech on the economy since her appointment to the post, Rachel Reeves will set out plans to crack down on waste in Whitehall. She will also reveal she has asked shadow cabinet members to set out proposals on how they intend to switch spending priorities within existing government spending envelopes. Her speech to the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) will also hint at further taxes on the rich. \"At a time when everyone is paying a tough price for the failings of a few, those who gained most in the good times cannot evade or avoid their responsibility to make a fair contribution,\" she will say. Reeves will promise the IPPR that Labour \"will be committing to new fiscal rules that will get our current budget back to balance and our national debt on a downward path\" before the next election. \"If we don't get this right, it doesn't matter what we say about anything else,\" she will say. \"Earning people's trust that we will be responsible custodians of public money is the precondition for gaining the right to be heard on any other issue.\" Reeves will argue that sound public finances are a platform for delivery \"for better public services; for rising living standards; and for building a more responsible, more equitable, more sustainable capitalism.\" She will also provide the clearest critique by Labour of the Treasury's own fiscal rules, and give a commitment that Labour will introduce their own. \"The first rule amounts to saying that the government promises to promise to eliminate the structural deficit five years forward from any given point,\" she will say. \"But because that five year horizon moves forward with every year, the delivery on that promise can advance ever farther into the future. \"As another commentator has pointed out, it is rather like someone promising to give up smoking in five years' time \u2013 a promise which can always be kept, without ever stopping smoking, because its fulfilment is always five years in the future.\" The second Treasury rule committing the government to debt falling as a proportion of GDP in 2015 at least gives the George Osborne a target with a fixed date, she will add, but one that could be met in a variety of ways far from relevant or sensible for ongoing stablity.\" Reeves will alsohighlight how far off track the government's projections for the public finances have become. Between the chancellor's spending review in autumn 2010 and the autumn statement in 2011, Reeves will suggest, \u00a317.8bn has been wiped off VAT revenues, \u00a351.2bn off income tax revenues, \u00a330.9bn off corporation tax revenues and an additional \u00a334.7bn in unplanned spending on tax credits and social security benefits. Speaking ahead of the latest public finance figures due to be published today, she will say: \"The chancellor might claim to be on track when today's public sector finances figures new come out, but he is only on track for targets which have already been revised up by a staggering \u00a3158bn. \"When resources are so constrained, we must also be absolutely ruthless in demanding maximum value for taxpayers' money, unlike this Conservative-led government, which seems to care so little about public services that it is shockingly casual and complacent about wasting scarce resources.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
