Their seventh album was originally scheduled for a September 2019 release, but was delayed because of the ill-health of frontman Blaine Harrison. It\u2019s now belatedly seeing the light of day, but there\u2019s precious little to distinguish it from its six predecessors, save some slightly more politically woke lyrics. Opener Screwdriver addresses the resurgence of the far right in Britain; Wrong Side of the Tracks pays tribute to Greta Thunberg. History Has Its Eyes on You, meanwhile, was inspired by the women\u2019s marches for gender equality, but is so insipid musically that it has to be chalked up as a point for the patriarchy. Rather more engaging are the martial rhythm of Petty Drone and the urgency of the title track\u2019s punchy chorus. But they are exceptions, and taken as a whole, A Billion Heartbeats offers depressingly little that\u2019s new, surprising or even interesting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
