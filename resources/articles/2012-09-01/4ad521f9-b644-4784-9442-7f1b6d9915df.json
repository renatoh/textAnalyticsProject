World Cup qualifiers at the very start of the qualifcation process are the vegetables at the feast of international \u2013 you kind of know you need them, they're hard to love yet, just occasionally, they can be exhilarating. Group C has the boiled carrot of Sweden v Kazakhstan, but also the baba ghanoush of Austria v Germany. Group A may have the unadorned broccoli of Scotland v Macedonia, but it also has the cauliflower cheese of Belgium v Croatia. In Group H, San Marino v Montengro may whet the appetite as much as a frost-bothered potato, but then you've got the crunchy yet smooth beetroot and goats cheese salad of Engl \u2026 ah. Still, news all of tonight's goals (and vegetables) can be found right here. 6.52pm: There's already been a shock in Asia. This from Reuters: Lebanon recorded one of their greatest soccer victories when they stunned three-times Asian champions Iran 1-0 in Beirut on Tuesday to throw open World Cup qualifying Group A. Roda Antar was the match winner, with the creative midfielder's 28th-minute strike the first goal Lebanon, ranked 124th by FIFA, had scored against their more illustrious opponents in this their eighth meeting. His team mates then defended bravely and wasted time much to the irritation of Iran, who struggled badly on the atrocious pitch which lacked grass in several areas as the home side claimed the landmark win. 6.55pm: In fact make that two shocks in Asia \u2013 Jordan have beaten Australia 2-1 in Amman. 7pm: The only goals so far in Europe have come in the early kick-off in the Ramat Gan Stadium in Israel. Russia are 2-0 up there thanks to Alexanders Kerzhakov and Kokorin. It's 0-0 at half-time between Cyprus and Iceland and 0-0 after half an hour between Georgia and Spain and between Romania and Andorra. 7.04pm: Romania break the deadlock in Bucharest thanks to Gabriel Torje, currently at Grenada on loan from Udinese as part of Project Pozzo. Expect him at Vicarage Road next season. 7.09pm: \"Today's the 11th,\" notes the splendidly-named Henry Buckle Loveless, \"which in Chile means the anniversary of the coup d'\u00e9tat which saw Thatcher's dictator friend, Pinochet, take power. Most workers will explain to their bosses that they need to finish work early in order to avoid the inevitable police v protesters street battles and definitely not to get home in time for Chile v Colombia.\" 7.12pm: GOAL! Bosnia-Herzegovina 0-1 Latvia Kaspar Gorkss \u2013 he of two Championship winners medals, very few Premier League appearances and one to many esses \u2013 has put the visitors ahead in Zenica. 7.15pm: \"As a Scot, I'm delighted to have the national team likened to unadorned broccoli,\" beams Simon McMahon. \"Not the most desirable or popular item on the shelf, but reasonably priced and good for you. There was a time in the not too distant past when we were more Pot Noodle than pot roast.\" 7.16pm: Romania are now 2-0 up at home to the minnows from Andorra, but Spain are struggling to break through against Georgia in Tbilisi. \"Anyone interested in watching a typical practice session for the Spanish would want to watch this match,\" reckons Bhisham Sharma. \"It's a classic Spanish 4-5-1 against the 9-1-0 formation Georgia seem to have taken from Chelsea. The one isn't Didier Drogba though so I doubt it will help them much.\" 7.19pm: GOAL(S)! Cyprus 1-0 Iceland and Norway 0-1 Slovenia Norway, who got their campaign off to the worst possible start with a 2-0 defeat in Iceland at the weekend, have fallen behind early to Slovenia. The days of Kjetil Rekdal and Dan Eggen, Jostein Flo and Erik Mykland seem ever further away. Meanwhile, Iceland have followed up that win over their Nordic neighbours by falling behind to Cyprus. 7.23pm: GOAL! Bosnia-Herzegovina 1-1 Latvia Zvjezdan Misimovic brings Bosnia-Herzegovina level from the spot. And in Tbilisi it's half-time: Georgia 0-0 Spain. 7.25pm: After grabbing two in Bosnia-Herzegovina's 8-1 shellacking of Liechtenstein at the weekend, that goal means Misimovic is now the joint-leading scorer in Uefa qualifying, along with Vedad Ibisevic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Bosnia-Herzegovina's Edin Dzeko. 7.31pm: It's proving to be a decent evening for Fabio Capello \u2013 his Russia side are now 3-0 up in Israel. Kerzhakov with his second of the game. And Norway have equalised against Slovenia \u2013 20-year-old AZ Alkmaar midfielder Markus Henriksen with the goal. 7.33pm: Things are kicking off now. But not in a pwoper nawty Danny Dyer way. More in a referees-blowing-whistles-to-start-football-matches way. 7.36pm: \"For years I've been trying to explain (through the medium of telepathy) to my namesake Egil Olsen that Kjetil W\u00e6hler isn't much cop, and now the tool has gone and cost us a goal,\" writes, erm, Egil Olsen. \"Thankfully, we got an equaliser right away, but this is truly shambolic. Still, thank you for printing the names of our heroes from the 90s, especially the magnificent Dan Eggen. He was voted second-sexiest member of our France 98 World Cup squad, you know...\" Only second? 7.41pm: GOAL! Hungary 0-1 Holland Jeremain Lens has given Louis van Gaals' revamped Dutch side an early lead in Budapest. Luciano Narsingh, Jordy Clasie, Kevin Strootman, Ricardo van Rhijn, Bruno Martins and Jetro Willems \u2013 all 22 or under \u2013 have all started for the Dutch tonight, with Robben, Heitinga, Mathijsen, Huntelaar, Emanuelson and Kuyt gathering buttock blisters on the bench. 7.47pm: GOAL! Hungary 1-1 Holland And in the time it took me to type all those names out, the once mighty Magyars equalise from the penalty spot through vowelaphobe Balazs Dzsudzsak. 7.49pm: In sentences-you-weren't-expecting-to-read-tonight news, the man voted Norway's sexiest at the 1998 World Cup was Havard Flo confirms Egil Olsen. I'm more of an Erik Mykland man myself. 7.50pm: GOAL! Serbia 1-0 Wales After a bright start Wales have fallen behind in Serbia. Manchester City's Aleksander Kolarov has put the home side ahead with a free-kick. Chris Coleman has his hands on his hips. Either he's not happy or he's about to do the Timewarp. I'm hoping for the latter. 7.53pm: GOAL! Hungary 1-2 Holland Bruno Martens, another of Van Gaal's new guard, restores the oranje advantage. 7.54pm: GOALS! GOALS! GOALS! In Brussels, Ivan Perisic has put the visiting Croatians ahead against the old Belgium. Bulgaria are now 1-0 at home to Armenia. Italy have taken five minutes to go ahead against Malta. Emre Belozoglu has got Turkey one up against Estonia. Switzerland, the new Belgium, are 1-0 up against Albania \u2026 (deep breath) \u2026 7.57pm: \u2026 Russia are now four goals to the good in Israel. Bosnia-Herzegovina have come from behind to lead Latvia 2-1, with last season's next big thing Miralem Pjanic getting the second. Montenegro have wasted little time in going 2-0 ahead in San Marino. And there's been another goal in Novi Sad \u2026 7.59pm: \u2026 where after a right old scramble \u2013 chock full with either some very dodgy defending from Wales, or, if we're feeling more charitable, great creamy spoonfuls of good fortune for the home side \u2013 Zoran Tosic (remember him?) has put Serbia 2-0 ahead. Coleman still has his hands on his hips, but as yet no sign of him bringing his knees in tight or the sort pelvic thrust to drive you insayeyeyeyeyane. 8.02pm: GOAL! In better news for the home nations, Northern Ireland are 1-0 up against Luxembourg through Dean Shiels. 8.03pm: GOAL! Serbia 2-1 Wales Well, well, well. Gareth Bale has just pinged a rasping free-kick into the vicinity of the top corner to bring Wales right back into it. 8.05pm: \"Strange goings on in central europe,\" reports Jamie Cain. \"Both the Austrian broadcaster ORF and the German ARD are showing 'their' team playing from left to right. Is there a precedent for this?\" 8.11pm: GOAL! Serbia 3-1 Wales Wales are proving a tad shambolic at the back. And when I say a tad, that's in the same way that Death Valley is a tad warm, the Pacific Ocean a tad wet, and the Low Anthem's second album is a tad good. Wales are carved open once more, a final despairing slide from, I think, Darcy Blake can't prevent Filip Djuricic from restoring the home side's two-goal advantage. 8.17pm: GOAL! Scotland 0-1 Macedonia Storm clouds over Hampden. Nikolce Noveski has put the visitors ahead. 8.20pm: Rasmus Elm has put Sweden 1-0 ahead against Kazahkstan and at the Ernst Happel in Vienna, Marco Reus has got the opening goal for Germany. 8.23pm: In Group H, Poland are ahead against Moldova thanks to Jakub Blaszczykowski. And there's heartbreak for the hosts in Tbilisi \u2013 with just four minutes remaining Roberto Soldado scored the winner for the European and World champions Spain. 8.26pm: Scotland are seeing plenty of the ball, but not really going anywhere against the Macedonians. It's not been a good few days for Craig Levein, although the current half-time score in Novi Sad puts Scotland's 0-0 draw with Serbia at the weekend into some context. 8.33pm: GOALS! GOALS! GOALS! An equaliser in Brussels \u2013 Anderlecht's Guilaume Gillet has made it 1-1 between Belgium and Croatia. Misimovic's fourth goal of the campaign means Bosnia-Herzegovina now lead Latvia 3-1. And in friendly news, the Republic of Ireland are 3-0 up against Oman. Robbie Brady, Shane Long and Kevin Doyle have scored the goals. 8.37pm: So by my reckoning the only 0-0s at the moment in Europe are between France and Belarus and between Greece and Lithuania. What about England v Ukraine I hear you ask. Well, Ukraine have just taken the lead at Wembley with an absolute screamer from the very talented Yevhen Konoplyanka. For more, join Scott Murray. I won't take offence.* *Please note: I will take offence. 8.41pm: So England losing, Scotland losing and Wales losing. Ah, scratch that. Kenny Miller has equalised for Scotland at Hampden, much to the relief of Craig Levein. A fantastic pass from Jamie Mackie puts it on a plate for the Vancouver Whitecaps man. 8.44pm: Someone has gone off with a knock in the Hungary v Holland game. Any Manchester United fans care to take a guess who? Those Arsenal fans over there will help you out. Robin van Persie has indeed been withdrawn by Van Gaal. Apparently just a knock, and the substitution came at half-time rather than during play, so there's cause for optimism that it's not too serious. 8.48pm: Half-time at Wembley and it's England 0-1 Ukraine. 8.49pm: Things aren't getting any better for Chris Coleman and Wales. In fact, seeing as Boris Tadic has made it 4-1 to Serbia, I'd suggest they're getting worse. 8.50pm: Mesut Ozil has doubled Germany's advantage in Vienna. And Jeremain Lens has put Holland 3-1 up in Budapest. 8.53pm: Northern Ireland continue to fly the flag for the home nations \u2013 they're still 1-0 up against Luxembourg. Lovely place Luxembourg. I recommend heading up to the northern bit to have a look at the Family of Man exhibition if you're ever in the area. 8.57pm: It's like 1998 all over again \u2013 Norwayt have roared back from falling a goal behind against Slovenia and have nicked three points thanks to John Arne Riise's 90th-minute penalty. 9pm: A quick rundown of the full-times so far in Europe: Bulgaria 1-0 Armenia Romania 4-0 Andorra Turkey 3-0 Estonia Cyprus 1-0 Iceland Norway 2-1 Slovenia Israel 0-4 Russia Bosnia-Herz 4-1 Latvia Georgia 0-1 Spain And the latest scores: Serbia 4-1 Wales Belgium 1-1 Croatia Scotland 1-1 Macedonia Italy 1-0 Malta Sweden 1-0 Kazakhstan Austria 1-2 Germany Hungary 1-3 Holland Switzerland 2-0 Albania N Ireland 1-0 Luxembourg Portugal 0-0 Azerbaijan Slovakia 2-0 Liechtenstein Greece 1-0 Lithuania San Marino 0-4 Montenegro Poland 1-0 Moldova England 0-1 Ukraine France 0-0 Belarus 9.03pm: Early in the second half, France are close to falling behind against Belarus. Hugo Lloris makes an important block from Stanislav Dragun. 9.08pm: GOAL! France 1-0 Belarus And having survived that scare, Les Bleus have gone up the other end and taken the lead in Paris. Etienne Capoue with his first international goal. 9.09pm: In Budapest, Holland are now 4-1 up against Hungary, Klaas Jan Huntelaar with the fourth. 9.11pm: It's five in Novi Sad. Branislav Ivanovic gets the fifth for the home side with 10 minutes to go. Only Montenegro (playing San Marino) have scored more goals than Serbia tonight. 9.13pm: Macedonia are having a good little spell at Hampden. Ferhan Hasani has just wasted a very dangerous position on the break. 9.16pm: Scotland are reeling and Hasani has just pinged an effort from the edge of the area square on to the post with Allan McGregor beaten. Levein responds by swapping Kenny Miller for Charlie Adam, a striker for a midfielder, and the Tartan Army voice a certain amount of disapproval. 9.18pm: Charlie Adam goes into the book for thundering into Goran Pandev. Dangerous free-kick \u2026 9.19pm: \u2026 which splats into the wall. Scotland are very much on the back foot now though. 9.20pm: France withdraw Olivier Giroud, but rest easy Arsenal fans \u2013 there's no suggestion that he's crocked. 9.23pm: Wales are on the wrong end of a proper shoeing from Serbia \u2013 it's 6-1 now in Group A. Serbia are a stronger nation than they were given credit for after the draw against Scotland, but when you look at some of the other scores across Europe, that's nothing but embarrassing for Chris Coleman and his side. 9.25pm: A roar of joy from the home terraces at Hampden \u2013 Jordan Rhodes is being brought off the bench. He's got 25 minutes or so to make an impression. 9.26pm: Full-time in Novi Sad: Serbia 6-1 Wales. And Scotland are inches away from going ahead against Macedonia, Rhodes nodding narrowly wide from a quick free-kick. 9.27pm: Over in South America Chile have taken the lead against Colombia thanks to Fiorentina's Matias Fernandez. With things pretty tight at the top of Conmebol qualifying, that's a big game. Argentina currently lead, but Chile would go top with a win tonight. Colombia are currently fifth and chasing Ecuador and Uruguay. 9.30pm: A few more full-times: Sweden 2-0 Kazakhstan; Austria 1-2 Germany; Hungary 1-4 Holland; Switzerland 2-0 Albania. 9.31pm: WHAT A SAVE! Or possibly WHAT A MISS! Pandev goes clean through for Macedonia and is denied by McGregor. The striker didn't hit his shot particularly well but the keeper (*checks big book of football cliches*) made himself big. 9.33pm: GOALS! France 2-1 Belarus The home side double their lead through Christophe Jallet, then find themselves pegged back almost immediately courtesy of Oleg Poutilo. 9.34pm: A pretty dire night (thus far) for the home nations takes another turn for the worse \u2013 it's Northern Ireland 1-1 Luxembourg thanks to the rather wonderfully named Dan Da Mota. 9.36pm: That's another chance for Rhodes, and another diving effort bouncing just wide. Again it was only a half (or perhaps three-fifths) chance. Stats show Macedonia have had 12 shots to Scotland's seven. 9.37pm: It's not been a particularly impressive night for Italy in Modena. An injury-time own goal from Andrew Cohen has given them a two-goal buffer against Malta. And indeed that is the final score. Meantime, it's still Portugal 0-0 Azerbaijan in Braga. After all those thoughts about the need for pre-qualifying, is this the night than the minnows make their case? 9.40pm: Nope. Apologies to all Azeris out there for putting the mockers on your team's efforts \u2013 Silvestre Varela has put Portugal ahead with just under half an hour to play. 9.41pm: Full-time in Belfast: Northern Ireland 1-1 Luxembourg. There'll be celebrating on the casements of Luxembourg City tonight. 9.42pm: Rib\u00e9ry. Dink. 3-1 France. 9.43pm: GOAL! England 1-1 Ukraine Frank Lampard spanks home a penalty with just five minutes to go. 9.46pm: Hearts-in-mouths at Hampden as Pandev pokes at goal. McGregor tumbles on it and Scotland, who have been pressing for the last 15 minutes, get back on the attack. 9.49pm: Macedonia pour forward like a tide of red custard over a jam roly poly. The break falters and it's Scotland's turn to go all Ambrosia in the other direction. Into injury time \u2026 9.51pm: BOOOOOOOO!! Full-time at Hampden and the home crowd voice their disapproval. Macedonia looked a decent side, though, particularly going forward. Even so, Levein is in the firing line now. 9.54pm: News from Luxembourg: \"The city has just had a fireworks display to end the annual fun fair, but the news from Belfast will keep celebrations going well into the night,\" writes Duncan Roberts. \"Potato cakes, Battin beer and honey schnapps \u2026\" 9.55pm: Here's James Alexander Gordon with the classified check: Group A Serbia 6-1 Wales Belgium 1-1 Croatia Scotland 1-1 Macedonia Group B Bulgaria 1-0 Armenia Italy 2-0 Malta Group C Sweden 2-0 Kazakhstan Austria 1-2 Germany Group D Romania 4-0 Andorra Turkey 3-0 Estonia Hungary 1-4 Holland Group E Cyprus 1-0 Iceland Norway 2-1 Slovenia Switzerland 2-0 Albania Group F Israel 0-4 Russia Northern Ireland 1-1 Luxembourg Portugal L-L Azerbaijan Group G Bosnia-Herzegovina 4-1 Latvia Slovakia 2-0 Liechtenstein Greece 2-0 Lithuania Group H San Marino 0-6 Montenegro Poland 2-0 Moldova England 1-1 Ukraine Group I Georgia 0-1 Spain France 3-1 Belarus 10.01pm: Right, that's it from me. A pretty miserable night for England and Scotland. A very miserable night for Wales and Northern Ireland. But grand times fort Serbia and Luxembourg. Thanks for your company. Stick around on site for all the reports and reaction to tonight's games. But from me, cheerio!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
