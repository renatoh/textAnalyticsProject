From 1912 onwards, with his Philadelphia Orchestra, he established the conductor as a more human figure, directly addressing his audience, challenging, provoking. Inevitably he was often dismissed as just a showman, but he was far more than that, and he is now being given his due as a great pioneer as well as a great musical personality. The point was well brought home in this Stokowski tribute from Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra. It started with a little fanfare for brass and percussion, a tribute to the conductor from Arnold Schoenberg. Stokowski had given the first American performances of a sequence of Schoenberg's works, and made the first ever recording of his massive Gurrelieder. That was why Schoenberg built his fanfare on themes from Gurrelieder, an attractive little squib revealing the composer in a rare relaxed mood. The cutting edge of the programme came with two of Stokowski's most spectacular orchestrations, Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor and Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. The Bach was one of the most striking items included in Fantasia, the film Stokowski made with Walt Disney, but hearing it in the concert hall made rather a different impression. The massive fortissimos with heavy brass set against weighty string tone had impact, but the poetical moments stuck in the memory even more, the rustle of strings and the murmur of flute anachronistic but magical. The wonder was that Davis took on his role of surrogate Stokowski with such panache, but then he has always shone as master of ceremonies at the Last Night of the Proms. So it was that the Mussorgsky orchestration, with its mighty fortissimos, built up a Prom atmosphere. Stokowski intended in his version to counter what he felt was unwanted gallicisation by Ravel in his orchestration, too refined to fit the Russian Mussorgsky. Stokowski even excised the two specifically French inspirations, the Marketplace at Limoges and Tuileries - a sad loss, but the relative compactness added to the final impact of the Great Gate at Kiev, with decibels such as one rarely hears even at the Festival Hall."}, "isHosted": false}}}
