From here, seen through a wall of 17 windows, the night skyline of lower Manhattan casts its phantasmal glow. To the distant north is the tapering silhouette of William Van Alen's 1920s Chrysler Building, a theatrical monument to this city's unbridled optimism; to the east the Municipal Building catches the drama of the dawn light; and five blocks to the south is the void left by the destruction of the twin towers. Libeskind came again to live in this city in 2003 (he was a music scholar here in his teens) after winning the competition to mastermind the rebuilding of the former World Trade Centre site - a project that has since been taken over by another architect. At first, he had no thought of buying a home. Unlike Le Corbusier or Frank Lloyd Wright, who always designed the places they lived in, Libeskind is not an architect who feels the need to create his own space. The closest he has come to domestic architecture is a studio for artist Barbara Weil in Majorca. He and his wife Nina had never owned anywhere, not even in the decade and more that they lived in Berlin while he oversaw the building of the Jewish Museum. In New York, as Nina says, \"We just assumed we'd rent as we always had.\" So they were not looking when they were contacted by the architect Alexander Gorlin, a friend and former student of Libeskind's, who said there was an apartment for sale in the block where he lived that they should see. The 100-year-old, 10-storey former industrial building is one of only a few of its kind in New York. It's a bit like a miniature of the Flatiron Building - its nose sticks out like the prow of a ship at one corner of Hudson Street, producing a floor space like a right-angled triangle with its acute angles shaved off. The hypotenuse faces east, while the west looks towards the Hudson river. Nina wasn't impressed. The previous owner had lots of children and needed lots of bedrooms, most of which were lined up along the light-giving east wall. The living area was hemmed in at the back. \"I was totally anxious, but, as I've learned, that's what New York is all about. It looked to me like an endless warren of small spaces.\" Their 15-year-old daughter, Rachel, wasn't impressed, either - her bedroom in Berlin had been almost the size of the entire flat in New York. But as Gorlin says: \"Given Daniel's interest in geometry, his love of light, his insistence on shaping his buildings directly out of their urban complex, I expected him to be interested.\" He was; he liked it immediately. \"How could I not? It's a beautiful place with views of some of New York's most iconic buildings. It is built where the two grids of the city converge and you can feel in the apartment the struggle of the grid. And when I looked at the light, there was no question. It wasn't a gamble.\" What Gorlin didn't expect was that Libeskind would ask him to be the architect. \"He said to me, 'It's much better for domestic harmony if I don't have to be at the centre of all the decisions and if they have someone else to complain to.'\" At first Gorlin felt unsure. \"It is pretty unusual for one architect to hire another for his own home. And I didn't know how much Daniel wanted the design to be him, how much me. His aesthetic is much more for aggressive projections, tilted planes, lots of angles. My style is more subtle. But Daniel said, 'You do what you want, I won't interfere.' And he kept his word.\" The apartment was completed in January. Gorlin's first decision was to reverse the plan of the public and private spaces; the living area now faces the east light. At the prow is the Libeskinds' bedroom, separated by a massive rotating aluminium door and built like an airplane wing. Rachel's bedroom, bathroom and the kitchen are along the west wall. Designing a home, Libeskind says, is no different from other architecture. \"You can't be too rigid in what you want, you have to be flexible.\" But a home also imposes its own constraints. It has to make not only physical but also emotional sense. The same is true of their furniture. The Libeskinds have never been interested in objects for their own sake. Each piece they have accrued comes with emotional attachment. The Mies Van der Rohe chaise, to Nina's chagrin, has followed them for 30 years, \"because though it is impossible to relax on, Daniel likes the way it looks\". The 1970s red table with marble top, which sits awkwardly with their other modernist pieces, is allowed to remain for the sentimental reason that they had it in Italy when first married. \"And the superstition that as a family we think it brings us luck,\" says Daniel. The original Le Corbusier chairs everyone loves. The woven carpet Gorlin was allowed to choose. The lights that hang above the Le Corbusier dining table are by the contemporary German designer Ingo Maurer and were approved by family committee. A home, Libeskind says, has to combine three factors: public, private and intimate. \"So, the initial fantasy - let's have nothing, let's keep the space open - quickly evolves into the reality: who needs what?\" Nina needed a kitchen. \"I love cooking, Daniel likes ordering in,\" she says, and she needed storage space. \"The secret of minimalism is closets.\" Rachel needed her own room and bathroom. Gorlin says: \"Originally Rachel hated it. Daniel's way of winning her over was to say she could have whatever she wanted - even classical mouldings.\" She declined the mouldings but chose tiny mother of pearl tiles in her bathroom and a cerulean blue for her bedroom walls. The overall effect is \"very chic\", her dad says. \"She has created her own, rather exotic world. Now she loves it so much she wants to go to NYU so she can live here.\" There were the \"inevitable small battles\". Over the hard flooring. \"Daniel wanted anything so long as it was white. Nina wanted wood,\" says Gorlin. The compromise is a pale Florentine stone, pietra serena, as used by Brunelleschi and Michelangelo. Daniel flatly refused to have two basins in their bathroom. \"Too bourgeois.\" But gave in. \"Which goes to show,\" Gorlin says, \"even the ideology of architects has its limits.\" Where possible, Gorlin added architectural in-jokes, \"secrets\" he thought Libeskind would appreciate. Like the drawers that look conventional but open at an angle, like a rhomboid. \"Just to show angles can be your friend.\" And the tiny window cut into the sauna wall, which lines up perfectly with the Chrysler Building. But it is Gorlin's solution to the main problem of the apartment, how to get east/west through light, that is his most radical innovation. A glass box sits to the right side of the living area - the Libeskinds' shower. When Nina first saw the plan her reaction was, \"Are you both crazy?\" But it is not wilful innovation, Gorlin says. \"It makes sense of everything - the views, the light, Daniel's desire to blur boundaries where he can.\" \"It sparkles,\" Libeskind says. \"There is something sensual, modern, erotic about it. It's also very amusing.\" And in the evening he can dim his apartment lights and take his shower looking out over the only city he has ever called home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
