Where Cheltenham winners climb the hill into a wall of noise, at Ascot they are lucky to get a murmur of approval. Yet even here there are moments when something snaps and the crowd let it all flood out. Yeats, the first four-time Gold Cup winner in the race's 203-year history, set them off last year and victory today for Manifest, the favourite, in the same race would probably do so again. Much as they loved Yeats, they love Henry Cecil more. Cecil \u2013 who is \"one of us\" as far as many in the Royal enclosure are concerned \u2013 has worked his way into the fabric of this meeting over the last 40 years. Since his first Royal Ascot winner, in the Queen Alexandra Stakes in 1970, there have been 71 more, including five in the Gold Cup itself. Just reading through the names of his winning jockeys \u2013 Fallon, Eddery, Cauthen, Piggott, Mercer, Dettori \u2013 is a history lesson, not least when you realise that the Dettori is Frankie's dad. The owners' column, too, tells its story, of men like Jim Joel, Lord Howard de Walden, Charles St George and Robert Sangster who died in the late 80s and early 90s. Since his last win in the Gold Cup, in 1987, Cecil has also lost his twin brother to cancer, been diagnosed with the same disease himself, seen two marriages disintegrate and plunged to reaches of the trainers' championship that would once have been unthinkable. Cecil's brave revival in recent seasons was marked here last year when Father Time took the King Edward VII Stakes, his first Royal meeting winner since 2002, but success in the Gold Cup, the feature event of the week, would mean much more, both to the trainer and to his fans. And in Manifest he seems to have a horse that everyone can believe in. \"I love Cup horses and this could be a very good one,\" Cecil said after Manifest ran away with the Yorkshire Cup by eight lengths last month. The bookmakers promoted Manifest to the top of the Gold Cup market on the spot and neither they nor the punters have seen anything since to suggest that he is anything but a rock-solid favourite. Cecil has an interesting array of opponents. They include Sir Michael Stoute, second in the current trainers' list at the meeting with 62 winners, who runs Ask, and Aidan O'Brien, perhaps the closest thing to his European heir apparent, though Age Of Aquarius has shown little as yet to suggest that he can follow Yeats in winning the race for O'Brien. There is also much to like about Kite Wood, last year's St Leger runner-up, who runs for the Godolphin operation, the formation of which accelerated the fallout between Cecil and Sheikh Mohammed in 1995. \"The Prince [Khalid Abdullah, Manifest's owner] has never won the Gold Cup and this may be the one to change that,\" Cecil said last night after Timepiece had provided his 72nd Royal meeting winner. \"I'm slightly worried about the ground, as he got slightly jarred up at York and took a while to come back. He has to stay the distance but I feel he will and we'd just like a bit of give in the ground.\" The other key question is whether Manifest will stay the marathon 2\u00bd miles, and it is such an extreme distance these days that there is only one way to find out. But what everyone in the 60,000-strong crowd should know is that, if Manifest is running, Cecil clearly thinks he will get the trip; and there have been few better judges of a staying racehorse in living memory. At one stage, between 1981 and 1986, Cecil saddled 16 winners here, a remark- able 14 of which started favourite. Cecil may never again quite manage to dominate the sport as he did two decades ago yet, if Manifest and Tom Queally come home in front this afternoon, the punters in the Silver Ring and the grandees in the Royal enclosure alike will celebrate as if 20 years had just fallen from their shoulders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
