Anybody who had not watched the match would assume she had won. In fact, she had just been beaten by 21-year-old Naomi Osaka. But this moment was perhaps the two-time Wimbledon champion\u2019s greatest achievement. Two years earlier, the 29-year-old Czech had been attacked by an intruder with a knife in her apartment in Prostejov. She fought him off, but suffered career-threatening injuries to her left hand \u2013 her playing hand. This was her first grand slam final since the attack. Accepting the runner-up plate, she tearfully thanked her team, saying: \u201cYou stuck with me when we didn\u2019t know if I would even be able to hold a racket again.\u201d We meet at the Sparta tennis club in Prague, where she is training for next month\u2019s Wimbledon. This is where the Czech Republic\u2019s top tennis professionals come to practise. In the car park, there is a huge advertising hoarding showing off the players who have learned, or at least refined, their trade here: current women\u2019s world number three Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1, her twin Krist\u00fdna (I later see the sisters hitting ferociously at each other), former Wimbledon finalist Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych and, of course, Kvitov\u00e1. She has made an astonishing recovery, returning to professional tennis only five months after the attack and winning eight singles titles over the past two years \u2013 more than any other woman, rising to be ranked world number two (she is currently at number five). Kvitov\u00e1 missed the recent French Open because of injury, but is determined to be fit for Wimbledon, for which she is currently second favourite behind Serena Williams. Kvitov\u00e1 is tall and striking, with big, bold, Picasso-esque features \u2013 eyes blue as cornflowers, long straight nose, perfect white teeth. She is known as one of the friendliest, most approachable players on the tennis circuit. Today she smiles easily as she tells me how thrilled she is to be back, and how much she is enjoying her game. Yet it does not take long to discover just how huge an impact the attack had, and continues to have, on her life. I ask if she feels she has been lucky or unlucky. \u201cI was lucky. Definitely. I was so lucky in an unlucky situation. To be honest, I could have been in the h\u0159bitov.\u201d I look blank. She does a Czech-English translation on her phone and passes it to me. \u201cH\u0159bitov \u2013 cemetery. I could be in the cemetery,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, definitely.\u201d Has coming so close to death changed her? \u201cYes, it\u2019s changed me, for sure. In a good way and a bad way.\u201d Having played professional tennis for a decade, she thinks she had started to take it for granted. \u201cSometimes when you\u2019re on tour for so many years, you feel flat or unmotivated, without drive.\u201d She talks about how draining the pre-match nerves would be, how exhausting the travelling was, how demanding it was on the body, and how often she\u2019d wish she was at home with her feet up, watching the telly. Then, when after the attack she did find herself at home watching the telly, it didn\u2019t take her long to realise how much she missed her sport \u2013 and how privileged she was to play at such a level. \u201cWhen I sat on the sofa and saw the girls playing tennis, and I wasn\u2019t able to, I just couldn\u2019t watch.\u201d She says she is now better at putting things in perspective. In the past she would angst about the little things. \u201cI was very stressed, but now I\u2019m more relaxed. I appreciate small things more, like beautiful weather, being with my family and my friends. If there\u2019s a big problem, I do care, but if it\u2019s a small, stupid thing, I\u2019m like, yeah, whatever.\u201d Kvitov\u00e1 grew up in the remote Moravian-Silesian town of Fulnek, 300km from Prague. Her mother Pavla, who worked for a white goods company, was calm and kind, she says; her father Ji\u0159\u00ed was an uncompromising maths teacher who demanded the best of his daughter and her two older brothers, both academically and on the tennis court. He took Petra to play every day after school. While her friends went to the pool to relax, she was hitting ball after ball back at her father. It\u2019s not that he was training her to be a professional, she says, it\u2019s just that he was terrified she would become a waster. \u201cHe never wanted us to be in the square smoking or taking drugs.\u201d Did she ever tell him to cut her some slack; that she just wanted to hang out with her friends? \u201cYes, of course. We had many conversations. I wanted to be with my friends so badly, but he was just too tough.\u201d Her brothers are also talented tennis payers, but Kvitov\u00e1 says they didn\u2019t have the mental stamina to compete at the highest level. They went to university and completed master\u2019s degrees, while Kvitov\u00e1 turned professional once she had finished secondary school. At the age of 21, she won Wimbledon as eighth seed, beating odds-on favourite Maria Sharapova 6-3, 6-4 in the final. Did she not find Sharapova\u2019s grunting (ferocious even by her standards that day) off-putting? She laughs. \u201cNo. You don\u2019t notice at the time, you\u2019re just focusing on your play and on the ball. But when I\u2019m watching it on TV, I hate it.\u201d When she was presented with the winner\u2019s plate, she looked bewildered, as if she couldn\u2019t quite believe what she had done. She nods when I mention it. \u201cExactly,\u201d she says. \u201cI was lost somewhere.\u201d Kvitov\u00e1 has had an unusual career, both in what she has achieved and what she hasn\u2019t. After that first Wimbledon win, her hero and fellow Czech, nine-times Wimbledon singles champion Martina Navratilova, said she believed Kvitov\u00e1 could get close to her record. But she struggled with the burden of expectation. She continued to win minor trophies and remained in the top 10, but another grand slam title eluded her. \u201cI was only 21 when I won, and suddenly people were saying I was going to win so many more \u2013 I wasn\u2019t ready for it. I was like, OK, so now I have to win every match.\u201d Three years later, in 2014, she did win another slam \u2013 again, Wimbledon. The relief was palpable. After playing the winning shot, she fell on her back and bathed in the glory. Kvitov\u00e1 had pulverised the Canadian Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-0 with an astonishing display of power and accuracy, hitting 28 winners and sending Bouchard packing in 55 minutes \u2013 one of the fastest Wimbledon finals ever. She says this win meant a lot because it showed she wasn\u2019t a one-hit wonder. \u201cPeople sometimes say, \u2018Yeah, she won a grand slam: she just woke up in a good mood.\u2019 But to win two of them, that changes it. Also it was a tough draw \u2013 I had to beat three Czech girls to win.\u201d I ask why the Czech Republic is producing so many fine players \u2013 three of the current top 20 women are Czech. Kvitov\u00e1 knows her tennis history. She guides me through the Czech greats, starting with Jaroslav Drobn\u00fd, who won three grand slams (the French Open, twice, and Wimbledon) in the 50s, then on to Jan Kode\u0161, who won the same three grand slams in the 70s. In the 80s, Navratilova dominated the women\u2019s game, while Ivan Lendl was world No 1 for 270 weeks. When Czechoslovakia was part of the eastern bloc, tennis was a means of escape, Kvitov\u00e1 says. \u201cThey could travel through tennis. Otherwise they stayed in Czechoslovakia. After Martina and Lendl, every kid played. They say it\u2019s an expensive sport, but at the end of the day you just need a racket and ball, and you can play against the wall.\u201d These days, she says, it\u2019s a virtuous circle \u2013 the more good players there are, the more competition, and the more it motivates the next generation of Czech players. She hasn\u2019t won another grand slam since 2014. In 2015, she suffered from glandular fever. In 2016, she played disastrously in all four majors, and at the end of that year was attacked. When she reached the final of the Australian Open in January this year, it was the first time she had gone beyond the quarter-final in a major tournament since winning Wimbledon. While the experts agreed Kvitov\u00e1 was unplayable on her day, she was infuriatingly inconsistent. Some said she lacked the desire to be a great champion, but when I ask her about this, she says it isn\u2019t true \u2013 until the attack she was, if anything, too hard on herself; she wanted to be one of the Czech greats like Navratilova and Lendl. These days, she puts herself under less pressure. There is another positive that has come out of her trauma, she says. \u201cI learned a lot about myself. I always knew I was a fighter on the court, but I didn\u2019t know I was a fighter off the court as well.\u201d Physically? \u201cNo, emotionally.\u201d Had she ever had to fight before? \u201cNo, not even at school.\u201d Was she surprised by her strength? \u201cAfterwards, yes, because he could have killed me.\u201d After her assailant entered the flat at 8.30am, pretending to be a plumber, he asked her to turn on the water in her bathroom. She did, and that\u2019s when he took out a knife with a 10-inch blade and put it to her neck. Kvitov\u00e1 grabbed the knife with both hands, holding the blade with her left hand, and managed to wrestle it away from him. In doing so, every finger on her left hand was lacerated and the nerves in her thumb and index finger were severed. She fell on the floor. When she reached for her mobile phone, he pushed it away. There was blood everywhere, she says, and she was still facing the intruder, who showed no sign of wanting to leave. \u201cMy mental strength came in that moment. I tried to get him to leave my flat. So I started to speak with him and then he left.\u201d She can\u2019t remember how long it took \u2013 five to 10 minutes. Something incredible must have happened in those moments, I say, because he may well have decided to kill her at that point \u2013 he could see all the blood, he knew he would go to jail for a long time if caught, and she could describe him perfectly. She nods. \u201cExactly. And he definitely knew that I was going to the police, so, yes, he could have killed me.\u201d What did you say to him? \u201cI offered him money.\u201d He asked how much she had and she said 10,000 crowns (\u00a3348). \u201cI said, \u2018Are you going to take the money and leave?\u2019 He wanted time. He told me he needed time to think. I said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t have the time for you to think about it here, I have to go to the hospital, so I\u2019m going to give you the money.\u2019 So he went, \u2018OK\u2019 and then he left.\u201d She comes to a stop. \u201cIf he had had the time to think, in the end he would have killed me.\u201d Kvitov\u00e1 admits she was surprised by her self-possession. She phoned the ambulance and the police, then called her doctor and told him to call a hand surgeon she knew. Was she aware how badly injured she was? \u201cI didn\u2019t want to look.\u201d As she talks, I stare at that left hand. It looks perfect. She turns it over for me. All five digits have delicate scarred rivulets running down them. Again, she says how lucky she was. The operation lasted four hours. Even today, the mobility is not 100% and there is no feeling in the tips of her thumb and index finger. Did you always think you would play again? \u201cYes,\u201d she says decisively. But then she pauses. \u201cI did have a brief thought that I wouldn\u2019t. I said, I\u2019m still alive so I\u2019m going to do something else. So I started to study communications at university. I thought, if I don\u2019t play again, I need to do something with my life.\u201d Kvitov\u00e1 says her fellow tennis players were very supportive, sending messages and videos on social media, and there was an emotional reunion when she played at the French Open in 2017. Still, something had changed. \u201cThey were looking at me a little bit differently. I don\u2019t think they knew how to speak to me, how they should be, how they should behave. Nobody really knows what you are feeling.\u201d If they\u2019d asked, what would she have said to them? \u201c\u2018Just be normal.\u2019 That was my main goal, that I could be the same as before. The same tennis player and girl, not a victim. That\u2019s all I wanted to be again, which I have managed now. Of course, I have moments when it\u2019s really bad, but that\u2019s normal. I want to be known for my tennis, not because somebody attacked me.\u201d It\u2019s remarkable that you have discovered so many inner strengths, I say. \u201cYes,\u201d she says quietly, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t told you the negative side yet.\u201d I sense she doesn\u2019t quite know where to start. \u201cI didn\u2019t go out for so long. I just stayed with people I know, especially my family, because I didn\u2019t trust anybody. And that is the very bad thing about it.\u201d Isn\u2019t it inevitable that she would go through a period like that? Suddenly those big blue eyes start to well up. \u201cI don\u2019t trust in people now. Especially men.\u201d She laughs through her tears. \u201cThat is why I\u2019m single, probably. I am trusting of people I have known for a long time, but I\u2019m not very trusting of people who I have just known a short while. I can\u2019t go in a taxi alone with men. When I\u2019m in the city or in the street, I\u2019m almost running. Sometimes, I have this huge fear that somebody is at my back. It\u2019s hard.\u201d Has she seen a therapist? \u201cYes. I think it was helpful. I don\u2019t have therapy any more.\u201d Does she think she was too trusting, I ask: many people wouldn\u2019t let strangers into their apartment without an appointment. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was, no. When I was travelling, I\u2019d never know who was due to come around to do some work. For me, it was natural to open the door, because it could have been the doping people.\u201d Professional tennis players have to provide a one-hour window every day, when they will be available for drug testing. Twelve months after the attack, 33-year-old Radim Zondra was arrested; in March this year he was convicted of serious battery and illegal entry into her apartment, and imprisoned for eight years (he was by then serving another prison sentence for a separate offence). It was reported that he hadn\u2019t specifically targeted Kvitov\u00e1. Has the verdict eased her mind? \u201cI think so. I always wanted him to be in jail. So, yes, for me, it\u2019s good that they convicted him, and he\u2019s there.\u201d Has it been cathartic? Now it\u2019s her turn to look at me blankly. I try again: does she feel she can breathe again now he is in prison? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like that at the time. For me the worst was when I had to go to court and give evidence.\u201d She testified in a separate room at the Brno regional courthouse, to avoid seeing Zondra. \u201cAfterwards I felt much better. But giving evidence was terrifying \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anybody.\u201d Gradually, Kvitov\u00e1 says, she is regaining her independence, but it is a slow, painful process. \u201cI stayed with my family for three months, and now I am living by myself in Prague. The first months were tough. I\u2019d be in bed and if I heard a noise from the bathroom, I\u2019d be thinking, oh my God.\u201d She wants to relearn to live by herself, though. \u201cI wanted to be me again. It was terrible that Mum and Dad, my brothers, my coaches, had to do everything for me.\u201d Do they feel you\u2019ve changed? She thinks about it. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting question. I\u2019ve never asked them, and they never tell me.\u201d *** One thing that delights Kvitov\u00e1 about playing again is that the women\u2019s game is changing: she is convinced it is more exciting than it has ever been. Yes, she says, the men\u2019s game has been blessed by a generation of greats, but it has been so predictable, with the semi-final of virtually every major tournament contested by Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. Look at the women\u2019s game today, she says. \u201cThe first 18 titles of the year were won by 18 different players. It\u2019s unbelievable. The gaps between the players are getting smaller and smaller. It\u2019s really about the day. Sometimes you wake up and you feel unbelievable, and sometimes so crappy. We have those hormones, right?\u201d She laughs. \u201cThe guys can just think about the tennis \u2013 they are a little bit different to us.\u201d She believes the old guard is changing, and says there is a greater camaraderie than when she started out. For years there were famously bitter rivalries, notably between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova. \u201cThe locker room is more free now. Maybe there\u2019s no pecking order, maybe it\u2019s just the generational shift. It\u2019s not as stressed. There is not as much hate.\u201d Twenty-six years ago, 19-year-old Monica Seles was stabbed in the back on court at the Hamburg Open, by a man obsessed with her great rival Steffi Graf. It remains the most shocking incident associated with tennis, possibly with professional sport. Seles was a phenomenon \u2013 she had already won eight grand slams and it was predicted that she would go on to break every record. She returned to the game two years later, and enjoyed some success, but won only one more major tournament. I ask Kvitov\u00e1 if she has spoken to Seles since the attack. Her face lights up. \u201cI have, actually. She came up to me last year at a pre-Wimbledon party. We\u2019d never met before. We said how much we admired each other for coming back after everything we\u2019d been through.\u201d Again, she looks tearful. \u201cSuddenly I saw somebody who had been in a very similar situation, somebody who understood. For her it happened on court, for me it was the apartment. For her the court was an unlucky place, for me it was the apartment.\u201d It\u2019s not surprising that Seles struggled when she returned, I say. \u201cYes, but she won a grand slam after it!\u201d Kvitov\u00e1 says instantly. Her message is clear. She still has her eye on that prize, and a third Wimbledon title would do just nicely, thank you. As we get up to leave, I tell her that returning to the game as she has is a wonderful achievement. She admits it hasn\u2019t been easy. \u201cAn interview like this reminds me what happened.\u201d I feel guilty about taking her back to the moment, but as I start to apologise, it becomes clear that I don\u2019t need to. \u201cTalking about it reminds me what I have come through,\u201d she says. \u201cIt reminds me that I should be proud of myself.\u201d \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).
