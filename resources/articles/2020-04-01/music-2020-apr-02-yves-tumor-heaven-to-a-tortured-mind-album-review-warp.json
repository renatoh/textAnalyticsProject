It struts along on a tight, funky rhythm, punctuated by explosions of dramatic blaxploitation-soundtrack brass swiped from a 1978 pop-funk album by South Korean vocalist Lee Son Ga. There\u2019s a weirdness to the whole enterprise \u2013 something chaotic and edgy about the atmosphere, and somewhere in the distance there are faintly disturbing cut-up female vocals \u2013 but you don\u2019t notice it unless you concentrate. Certainly you don\u2019t notice it as much as the impassioned vocal, the lyrics about sexual desire and unrequited love, and the killer chorus. It sounds like the track of a leftfield artist marshalling themselves to make something more straightforward and commercial \u2013 which fits with the person behind it. The first album by Yves Tumor (who uses they/them pronouns), When Man Fails You, which they self-released in 2015, was way out in the leftfield: a collection of dark ambient instrumentals, bursts of noise and unsettling field recordings. Each of their acclaimed subsequent releases seems to have edged at least a little closer to the mainstream, but never as stridently as this. But the sense that Bowie may be making a concerted bid for a wider audience lasts only slightly longer than Gospel for a New Century does. Track two, Medicine Burn, opens with a rolling funk rhythm but is quickly consumed by a dense sprawl of noise in which distorted electric guitar becomes indistinguishable from harsh electronics. There\u2019s definitely a song in there, but it fights for space amid an ever-increasing sonic tumult. Casting around for something to compare it to you might suggest Parliament-Funkadelic at their most whacked-out, or side one of David Bowie\u2019s \u201cHeroes\u201d (there\u2019s a hint of Beauty and the Beast, or Joe the Lion\u2019s Robert Fripp-assisted wall of noise, and some of Bowie\u2019s wilful opacity in the lyrics \u2013 \u201cSevered heads on the mental guillotine, life of blasphemy, room full of kings\u201d). But it doesn\u2019t really sound like either. It\u2019s viscerally thrilling but it sounds no more like a bid for mainstream acceptance than it does the Massed Bands of the Coldstream Guards. Whatever you think I am, I\u2019m not: that seems to be the overall message. Few current artists are quite as slippery and evasive as Sean Bowie, who retains a perfunctory social media presence and rarely gives interviews. When they do, they go out of their way to resist categorisation. They don\u2019t define their androgynous, constantly-changing appearance: \u201cMy gender or my sexuality or my feelings about equality [aren\u2019t] my personal brand.\u201d It\u2019s not even clear if Sean Bowie is their real name. What we do know is that they come from Knoxville, Tennessee; that they worked with \u2013 or perhaps constituted the entire lineup of \u2013 a chillwave band called Teams; collaborated with rapper Mykki Blanco; and have a liking for both \u201cfunky, groovy shit\u201d (a legacy of their parents\u2019 love of soul) and \u201charsh, disgusting shit\u201d. And they\u2019re a fan of Throbbing Gristle, whose influence you can hear in the mournful, distant tones and streaks of noise that decorate the instrumental Asteroid Blues. One other fact about them is that, as evidenced by Heaven to a Tortured Mind, they\u2019re exceptionally talented. There\u2019s real skill involved in coming up with something that sounds coherent while shifting through so many styles, as if defying the listener to get a handle on it \u2013 often over the course of the same track. The lo-fi R&amp;B of Romanticist is disrupted by clumsy guitar power chords, then a knotty mesh of samples and noise; Kerosene! goes from hazy guitar-and-synth indie somewhere in the region of Ariel Pink to a grandstanding stadium rock guitar solo to fervent female vocals that variously, if vaguely, recall the Cocteau Twins\u2019 Elizabeth Fraser and Claire Torry\u2019s star turn on Pink Floyd\u2019s The Great Gig in the Sky. But Heaven to a Tortured Mind really does sound coherent. It is punchy and concise; its stylistic leaps and short-circuits always feel intended \u2013 the product of someone operating to their own internal logic rather than randomly throwing ideas at the wall. It helps that Bowie is a really strong songwriter. For all the musical bedlam, virtually everything here is richly melodic. Tellingly, the album\u2019s weakest moments come when they let the tunes slip from their grasp, as on Folie Impos\u00e9e or the meandering Strawberry Privilege. But , if you so desired, it feels as though you could alter the arrangement of Super Stars or album closer A Greater Love and turn them into something straightforwardly commercial. Of course, that would be missing the point. The excitement of Heaven to a Tortured Mind lies in the uncertainty it engenders in the listener, the feeling that you\u2019re never sure what\u2019s about to happen next. That\u2019s a rare sensation in a predictable musical landscape. In the best sense of the phrase, Yves Tumor is off in a world of their own.
