You have to remember there\u2019s a victim at the centre of this. He really shouldn\u2019t stand again here.\u201d Cairns stepped down after being accused of lying about his knowledge of an allegation that a former adviser had sabotaged a rape trial. He has been MP in south Wales since 2010 but many locals at the Vale of Glamorgan pub doubted he would win this time \u2013 if he chooses to stand in the first place. Ron Davies said Cairns had no option but to resign as Welsh secretary. As a retired police officer, he instinctively distrusts anyone who has derailed a trial as a judge decided Cairns\u2019s ex-aide did. \u201cThe law is the law,\u201d he said. Davies said he used to vote Labour but lost respect for the party over the Iraq war and changed his vote. \u201cBut to be honest, I\u2019ve lost trust in the lot of them,\u201d he added. Roger Price, a retired local government officer, succinctly summed up his feelings about Cairns: \u201cGood riddance. He should stand down \u2013 he has totally lost credibility.\u201d Patrick Sheehan, a painter and decorator, at least had some respect for Cairns\u2019s longevity. The MP served as Welsh secretary under David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good going,\u201d he said. Sheehan said he would study the ins and outs of the case before deciding if he would vote for Cairns if he does stand again. Cowbridge is a tightknit little town. A Labour-supporting bus driver said he used to ferry the ex-Welsh secretary\u2019s son around and thought Cairns was a \u201cnice fella\u201d. The owner of one of the many smart shops chose not share an opinion because Cairns\u2019s wife is a good customer. The Vale of Glamorgan, which includes the seaside town of Barry as well as middle-class Cowbridge, is something of a bellwether constituency. From 1997 until Cairns won the seat nine years ago, it was held by Labour. But in 2017 his majority was a modest 2,190, with Labour second, Plaid Cymru third and the Liberal Democrats fourth. The Vale of Glamorgan, unlike Wales as a whole, narrowly backed Remain. Sally Stephenson, director of the Pencil Shop on the High Street, is standing for the Lib Dems this time and sees Cairns\u2019s resignation as an opportunity. \u201cHis situation was untenable. Even before this I was hearing a lot of Conservative voters saying they couldn\u2019t go for this bunch of Tories. They thought that Alun has been lost to the dark side \u2013 the Boris Johnson side. But they won\u2019t be able to support Jeremy Corbyn so maybe there\u2019s a chance for us.\u201d The Labour candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards, called for Cairns to stand down. \u201cIt\u2019s about being fit to fulfil his role,\u201d she said. \u201cHis constituents have the right to expect their MP to act with integrity. People still want to know what he knew about the court case, when did he know it and why has he misled us. People feel let down and are hurting.\u201d Loveluck-Edwards spent her day campaigning away from Cowbridge in a less affluent area of the constituency. \u201cPeople are relying on food banks. Elderly people I was talking to today in a block of flats are feeling they have to decide whether to heat their home or put food on the table. People are feeling the pinch.\u201d Of course, there was some support for Cairns in Cowbridge. Bryan Young, a television engineer, who was having his hair trimmed in Barbers 72, said: \u201cIt\u2019s all about throwing dirt around now that the election has begun.\u201d Young has voted Labour all his life but has joined the Brexit party. \u201cFrankly I just want whoever can get us out to win,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody is perfect. He should be left to get on with his job.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
