So wrote Herman Muthesius, technical attache to the German embassy, to his patron, Grand Duke Carl Alexander, outlining his planned book on English domestic architecture. 'Such a publication would be of great value, especially here in Germany,' the grand duke replied keenly. 'Because of history, the notion of homeliness and home comforts is less developed here, in our less fortunate Fatherland, than in England.' The result was Muthesius's 1904 classic The English House, reissued by publisher Frances Lincoln. A scholarly chronicle of British domestic design, it constituted a deeply affectionate testimony to this unsung component of European culture. And, 100 years on, its ethos still shapes the way we live. In contrast to the continental fashion for apartment living, Muthesius provided an unrivalled psychological insight into English home-ownership. 'The only advanced country,' as he put it, 'in which the majority of the population still live in houses, a custom that has survived all the political, social and economic changes that European civilisation has undergone in the past 150 years.' This passion for domesticity was rooted in Anglo-Saxon individualism. 'The Englishman sees the whole of life embodied in his house. Here, in the heart of his family, self-sufficient and feeling no great urge for sociability, pursuing his own interests in virtual isolation, he finds his happiness and his real spiritual comfort.' It was also, Muthesius suggested, not unrelated to inclement weather. 'Gathered round the fire in the seclusion of the room, the family seeks refuge and comfort.' The English House traced this cultural affinity for domestic seclusion from the Norman castle via Elizabethan, Palladian, and Classic styles up to the modern world of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Garden City movement. His architectural heroes were Norman Shaw and Philip Webb, his ideal home, the Red House at Bexleyheath. Designed by Webb for William Morris in 1859, Muthesius was as much enamoured by the Arts and Crafts decor as the red-brick Gothicism and towering chimney stacks. Another favourite was Webb's Clouds House, at East Knoyle outside Salisbury, which Muthesius admired for its 'spaciousness, monumentality and entirely original design'. For The English House celebrated the 'unassuming naturalness' of British domestic design in its entirety - from garden gates to cavity walls, even the plumbing. Britain had 'its full quota of tasteless speculative housing', but they were as nothing to the 'excesses of jerry-building' in Berlin. Instead, what was remarkable was the ambition, style and precision of our construction trade. But Muthesius was more than just an objective chronicler of the architectural scene. Along with his friend Walter Crane and others from the Arts and Crafts and Garden City movement, he helped shape our 20th-century reverence for domestic retreat. His was a determinedly middle-class vision of British culture which studiously ignored the vibrant, associational life of the working-class street. According to Muthesius, 'outside pleasures, the hubbub of the metropolitan streets, a visit to a bierkeller or a cafe, are almost hateful' to the English. Yet that was only part of the story. In fact, across thousands of terraced Edwardian streets, public and private intermingled seamlessly. 'Home may be private, but the front door opens out of the living room on to the street, and when you go down the one step or use it as a seat on a warm evening you become part of the life of the neighbourhood,' was how academic Richard Hoggart described a 1950s working-class civil society of pubs and clubs, street corners and back lanes. There was far more to English culture than William Morris wallpaper. But Muthesius and Crane's views were in the ascendant and 20th-century planners followed suit with a systematic destruction of street fabric in favour of the hallowed home on car-dependent, cul-de-sac estates. And the results are all too apparent in the report from Play England on the collapse of public space: only 21 per cent of children now play regularly in the street or an area near their home, while 71 per cent of adults can recall doing so when they were children. As we bolt the front door, plug away at the DIY and leave the children to a different sort of MySpace, it seems Muthesius's vision of a private, secluded England has triumphed. But the irony is that while we have embraced his culture of domesticity, we have lost the skills to deliver it. Today's leading developers are snubbing the shoddy workmanship of the UK construction trade for German Huf Haus and WeberHaus kits. Any true apostle of Channel 4's Grand Designs avoids bog-standard British architects for the latest in Rhineland design and eco-friendly PassivHaus technology. The heirs to Muthesius are now selling back to us his century-old dream of the English house."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
