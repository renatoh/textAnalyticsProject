Don't read on if you haven't seen episode eight\u2013 and if you've seen more of the series, please be aware that many UK viewers will not have done \u2026 Richard Vine's episode seven blog There's a satisfying focus on individual characters in this series and tonight was a real treat for Sawyer fans (he has always seemed to be a favourite among the ladies). And, just like old times, at the end (in both versions of the universe), it was Sawyer and Kate, together again. But, while on the island it was Sawyer making the long-running getting-off-the-island promises to Freckles, in the X Universe it was the exact opposite: Sawyer halting Kate's escape dash. Sawyer, the cop that is. With his sidekick Miles: Lost's very own Crockett and Tubbs (\u00a9Richard Vine). Does Sawyer's LAPD career mean that the alternative timeline is not just about what life would be like if the plane hadn't crashed and the passengers have/not achieved redemption? Is it, in fact, how their lives would have turned out if they had never met Jacob? Instead of adopting the name of the man who destroyed his family and grifting his way around (trying to track down the con man), Sawyer is still James Ford and trying to trace his nemesis utilising the skills of a policeman. In a neat exposition of how thin the line is between good and bad, making the right or wrong choices, Sawyer/Ford tells his dinner date (Charlotte!): \"I got to the point in my life when I knew I was going to be a criminal or a cop. So I chose cop.\" (Although only after employing a classic Sawyer avoidance tactic: \"Have you ever seen Bullitt?\") While it was great to see so much of Miles, he was unusually denied his string of witty one-liners. Meanwhile Kate didn't spend as much of the episode with Sawyer as she did with Claire. Flocke put that relationship into perspective: \"A long time ago I had a mother. She was a madwoman ... Aaron has a crazy mother too.\" While I have no doubt that many of you will have been excited by Charles Widmore's arrival, I was mostly confused by the whole location of the submarine harbour question. This submarine harbour was on Hydra Island. Is there not a harbour on the main island too? Did Dharma really build two sub harbours for the same project? Given my championing of the purgatory thesis, I can't let Michael Landon's Little House on the Prairie-spun wisdom pass by without quoting: \"People are never really gone when they die.\" Cameo of the week/meeting up in the Sideways universe \u2022 Drive Shaft vocalist Liam Pace attempting to bale his drug-smuggling bro, Charlie, out of the city jail. \u2022 The love of Faraday's life, Charlotte, ends up in Sawyer's bed. But only the once. The grand alliance count It has certainly gone a bit Lord of the Flies, with the two armies gathering (or is that three, now that Widmore's gang are in town?) And some of the army members are looking more than a bit shifty about their roles: Sayid certainly looks like a man who knows that he can no longer pretend to be conflicted about his skill for killing. Team Jacob's disappeared in the jungle: Hurley, Sun, Ilana, Frank, Miles, Ben and, for the sake of argument, Jack (because he's with Hurley and he is Jacob's representative on the island these days). Team Flocke's gearing up for a fight: Claire, Sayid, Sawyer, Temple survivors, Kate (with reservations), Jin (until he finds Sun) Polar bear sightings No actual Arctic livestock, but we did see their old cages. Quotes of the week Widmore: \"How do I know I can trust you?\" Sawyer: \"Same way I know I can trust you.\" Sawyer: \"Is your name even Zoe?\" Zoe: \"Is yours even Sawyer?\" Flocke sums up Sawyer pretty well: \"You are the best liar I ever met.\" Predictions \u2022 Kate will still bounce between the attentions of Jack and Sawyer. \u2022 I wouldn't like to predict whether any of them will get off the island. Or maybe they already have. \u2022 Personally I think that Widmore is no match for Flocke, even with his sub, his guns and his Dharma style sonar fence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
