Peter van Peborgh says it will be run in the \"spirit of open-minded enquiry and co-operation engendered by the 'gentlemen scientists' of earlier times\" and wants to hear from individuals or groups interested in supporting independent thinking, enquiry, research and analysis, regardless of their formal academic credentials. He hopes the association will give individual enthusiasts a home and a voice through publishing articles and papers on its website. \"These are people who are not in a university or industry. They are doing research in their own time and money - their own shed. These people are not nutters and not obsessives. They are serious people doing serious research outside the establishment of research,\" said Mr Van Peborgh, who is working on process modelling. \"Independent researchers have a proven track record in founding most of the present fields of science and humanities,\" said Mr Van Peborgh. \"Look at famous names like Darwin (evolution), Einstein (Relativity), Priestley (chemistry), Adam Smith (economics), and Gilbert White (ecology). The list is endless.\" He said AIR would support both pure and applied research and would seek to \"embrace all fields of knowledge in science, technology and the humanities whilst applying and maintaining high standards of scholarship and integrity\". Unfortunately for an association seeking to dispel the slightly batty Professor Brainstorm image of the maverick inventor, Mr Van Peborgh has chosen the same initials as the Annals of Improbable Research which record some of the more ludicrous examples of research and also award the Ig Nobel prizes to honour people whose achievements \"cannot or should not be reproduced\". One of the most recent is a man who has spent his life perfecting an armoured suit in which he can meet grizzly bears."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
