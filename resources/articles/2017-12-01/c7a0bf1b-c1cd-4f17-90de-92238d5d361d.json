Three other people sustained non-life threatening injuries in the attack, police said. Ullah is a Bangladeshi national who emigrated to the United States in 2011 with a F-43 family visa, the White House confirmed. That means a family member living in the US would have sponsored his application. He had a taxi and limousine license dated from 2012 until its expiration in 2015, according to the city\u2019s licensing commission. But little else has been confirmed about the suspect since a press conference held by city officials on Monday morning. Authorities are treating the bombing as \u201can attempted terror attack\u201d, said the city mayor Bill De Blasio. New York City police commissioner James O\u2019Neill said the suspect \u201cdid make statements\u201d but declined to elaborate when asked if Ullah was connected to the Isis terror group. The Associated Press reported that he was inspired by Islamic State but may not have had any direct contact with the group, citing law enforcement sources. The NYPD declined a request to provide more information on the suspect. Public records indicate Ullah lived in Brooklyn and police were investigating an apartment building in the Kensington neighbourhood early on Monday afternoon. An officer wearing a bomb squad vest and a helmet, carrying a set of bolt cutters, entered the building along with a man wearing a FBI jacket and other police officers. Witnesses said a Swat team had earlier entered the six-storey building, at the side of the busy Ocean Parkway, which runs north-south through this section of Brooklyn. Police were also reportedly present at a property about half a mile away, also said to be linked to Ullah. The NYPD did not give out public information on the operations. Ullah\u2019s immigration status was seized on by the White House during a press briefing on Monday afternoon. The Trump administration, with its hardline stance on immigration, has advocated for a crackdown on certain visas classes. \u201cWe must move to a merit based system of immigration,\u201d said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Monday. She added: \u201cI think that the president is certainly concerned that Congress, particularly Democrats, have failed to take action in some places where we feel we could have prevented this. Specifically, the president\u2019s policy has called for an end to chain migration. And if that had been in place, that would have prevented this individual from coming to the United States.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
