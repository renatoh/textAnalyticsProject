As a youngster there was a great deal of daylight to be seen under his belly, but not now. His lad, Fred Storrar, with the blue and white Hamdan al-Maktoum stripes painted on his helmet, is all too aware that he is perched high up on a lot of horse. During the winter Nayef grew an extra 1 hands to take him to the 16.3 hands mark, and as a result the long, raking stride that eats up ground appears to be even more extensive. \"He almost floats,\" reckons Tregoning, \"And doesn't he just look as fresh as paint!\" Nayef is ante-post favourite for Saturday's Eclipse Stakes, the 10-furlong second leg of the British Horseracing Board's new three-race \u00a31m Summer Triple Crown. If Nayef wins at Sandown he can earn that huge bonus with victory in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes on July 26 at Ascot. And if he goes on to lift the Juddmonte International Stakes at York on August 19, there is a total bonus of \u00a35m for the BHB Grand Slam. Serious money, even to a seriously rich Arab owner. Rain has come into the equation, though. Kingwood House stables in Lambourn is shining under a steely sheen, the aftermath of early-morning showers in the south which have turned Sandown's going into good to firm. The underfoot for the royal meeting when Nayef won two weeks ago was lightning fast, but his trainer - who learned his trade as assistant to the former royal trainer Dick Hern for 14 years - is unconcerned. \"We know our chap goes on soft,\" says Tregoning, \"but he's better on fast. And bear in mind that if it is soft at Sandown it will give him a harder race. However, he should get over it before the King George so I shan't worry about it too much.\" The crocodile of horses begins to snake around the mile-long Polytrack all-weather gallop for a second time. Nayef, led by Day Fort, a progressive three-year-old who has won his last two starts, canters for four furlongs, walks for a furlong and then finishes with a three-furlong canter. \"A racehorse likes routine,\" Tregoning says. \"They are creatures of habit and don't like too much change.\" Nayef could well have a pacemaker for Saturday's contest and it could be Izdiham in the same Hamdan colours, who can go a good clip and ensure his stable-mate comes off a strong gallop, which he loves to do. Also in the entourage behind the stable star is High Accolade, who has the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket and York's Great Voltigeur pencilled in for him before a possible tilt at the St Leger. \"He's got a great future in front of him next year, and as far as the Leger goes we are not going to murder him for this season,\" adds Tregoning. Hammiya goes by, snorting and full of herself. She was hampered badly in the Epsom Oaks and lost all chance she had, yet she will soon be on a retrieving mission which could involve the Lancashire or Yorkshire Oaks. Tregoning gets back into the driving seat of his now famous red transit van. The BBC sent Willie Carson and a camera crew down recently to do a montage of the stable's runners and some post-production person had the bright idea of dubbing in the Postman Pat theme tune as Tregoning drove the van on his rounds. Can Nayef deliver in his challenge for the millions? Tregoning is sure he will put on a cracking show, and there is affection and pride in his voice as he recalls: \"When I saw him as a yearling in Dubai I was sure he would top any sale anywhere in the world. He was a lovely juvenile, but we lost him a bit from two to three as he went weak on us. \"But then be began to grow and he has come good in the end. Patience pays huge dividends in the racing game, and thank goodness Sheikh Hamdan has it. Nayef shouldn't let him down.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
