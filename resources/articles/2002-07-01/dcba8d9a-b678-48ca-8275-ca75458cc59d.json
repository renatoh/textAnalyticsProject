But Surrey are adept practitioners at the honours game. They are top of the table and their cricket carries, by right, a haughty air. Here Warwickshire were 182 behind on first innings, forced to follow-on. Surrey, depleted by international calls and injury, still appear to have the resolve and balance to take the pennant for the third time in four years. In the context of modern county cricket they are the undisputed monopolists. They had it all to themselves for seven years in the 50s when Peter May, Peter Loader, Tony Lock and Jim Laker clinically brushed aside all opposition. The other counties were envious and Surrey, disliked for their noisy, exultant sense of triumph on the field, were brilliant rather than popular. Now again they are the best: they have the seam and, especially, the spin. Five of their most talented players are missing again and yet they have the cover to make good the omissions. But surely such riches can lead to selection agonies? Keith Medlycott, Surrey's manager and coach, accepts the challenge. \"At the same time,\" he said, \"it's reassuring to be in a position to leave out high-quality players. Our success over recent years has been based on squad involvement. As for selection, it's a matter of common sense and mutual honesty. High-quality players aren't always happy to be left out - I wouldn't expect them to be.\" Medlycott added: \"We don't employ the rotation system but we feel there is an excessive amount of cricket and it's no bad thing for some of the players to have the chance to fill up the tank for a few days. \"We like to think we have the best squad in the country. This isn't a matter of luck - it's partly down to wise pre-planning and encouraging young players to come through.\" The Guildford all-rounder Rikki Clarke, the county's most exciting newcomer, is an obvious example. Yesterday Warwickshire's Neil Smith, erstwhile captain and no longer assured of a championship place, did most to sustain the faint hopes of avoiding the follow-on. Far from being a clone of the more cerebral style of his cricketing father, he enjoys brandishing a fiery blade. Stern of face and broad of shoulder, he wasted no time in making clear his intentions. Smith took six consecutive boundaries off James Ormond; five of them were in one over, helped by a no-ball. They included a Sunday afternoon heave or two but were mostly solid, decent blows. He was ninth out, caught at short leg as Saqlain Mushtaq tweaked. There were two sixes, 11 fours and a brave attacking statement as his side sagged around him. Earlier, Shaun Pollock had reached his half-century before Ormond had him lbw. Ormond, despite Smith's insensitive regard for his pace, finished with five for 116, his first five wickets for Surrey, and Saqlain four for 97. Second time around Warwickshire's openers Mike Powell and Mark Wagh revealed more fibre in a stand of 85. Then Ian Salisbury dismissed Wagh leg-before as he tried to sweep and quickly sent back Ian Bell too. Bad light stopped play with Warwickshire on 165 for three. Powell remained doggedly on 66. Dominic Ostler was less than pleased when given out to a close catch, delaying his departure. There is a grim battle ahead today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
