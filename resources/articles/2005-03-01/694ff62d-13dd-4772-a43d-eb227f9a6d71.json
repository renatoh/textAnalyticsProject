As new hoteliers, family life has become severely disrupted and summer holidays a distant memory. So we hit upon the idea of a spring break last year. The only difficulty was trying to satisfy the requests of three very different siblings who were beginning to moan about the peace and tranquillity of their new surroundings in Aberdyfi. So we tried a week in Las Vegas. Where did you stay? The Luxor hotel (luxor.com) - our youngest had requested Egypt as his choice of destination. Contrary to initial doubts, it wasn't all tack and tinsel. Service-wise, the usual American standards of cleanliness and attentiveness prevailed. The rooms, albeit faceless (what did I expect? - the place has nearly 3,000 bedrooms) were comfortable and even bigger than anticipated. In fact, my only complaint was the usual - why can't we have a kettle in our room? I don't know I want a cup of tea until I want one! What did you do? We relaxed by the pool in glorious sunshine, and marvelled at the parade of barefoot brides and fancy dress grooms (Robin Hood was a favourite). It satisfied our daughter's need to shop until we all dropped, and even our hard-to-impress eldest son described the helicopter flight over the Grand Canyon and boat ride down the Colorado River as \"awesome\". \u00b7 Virgin Holidays (0871 222 0306, virginholidays.co.uk) offers seven nights at the Luxor hotel from \u00a3759 room only, including flights and car hire. Alastair Sawday, Series editor of Special Places to Stay (specialplacestostay.com) Where would you like to be right now? Andalucia. As well as being very beautiful and wild, it's likely to be sunny in spring. Where would you stay? I'm going this week and borrowing a house. But in the past we've stayed at El Tejar, a relaxed B&amp;B near Ronda. It's the highest house in Montecorto and offers sweeping 360-degree views of the countryside. El Tejar has an easy going culture, a lack of pretension and great physical beauty. You're guaranteed convivial company, both from the owners and fellow guests, and also the people who live locally. I adore anywhere with peace, and hate places that are remotely exclusive - hotels shouldn't be about luxury. What will you do? Eat, walk, laze and visit little bars. I love tapas, especially Spanish meats and chorizo. We'll walk in the Grazalema National Park, and might visit Ronda, Granada and Cadiz. \u00b7 El Tejar, Calle Nacimiento 38, Montecorto (+ 34 952 184053). Doubles from \u20ac75 per night, B&amp;B. British Airways (ba.com) offers flights to Malaga from approximately \u00a341 each way, plus taxes. Seven days car hire with Europcar from approximately \u20ac400. Juliet Kinsman, Editor of Mr &amp; Mrs Smith Hotel Collection UK &amp; Ireland and European Cities (mrandmrssmith.com) Where would you like to be right now? I go away a lot in the spring and the winter, always to the southern hemisphere. South Africa is an obvious choice because the weather is great, and with a two-hour time difference, you don't get jet lag. The fruit and veg in South Africa is amazing. Where would you stay? I'm not mad on huge five-star hotels - I'd rather experience the real city than stay in a bubble of international luxury. The Fritz Hotel is a small two-storey place that's all white paintwork and rug-covered wooden floors with an interesting array of art deco and 1950s furniture. Sure there are places that are plusher and don't have almost threadbare carpets on the stairs, but sitting on the Victorian wooden balcony, looking up at Table Mountain as the sun sets is a luxury in its own right. What would you do there? Read - I never get the chance at home. But I'm a doer, too. In South Africa I stroked a cheetah in the Spier vineyard, visited African penguins at Boulders Beach and spent two nights on safari at the Gorah Elephant Camp (gorah.com). This lodge in the Addo National Park offers colonial splendour and game galore, and the frisson of lying at night with only a canvas sheet between you and the great outdoors. \u00b7 Fritz Hotel, 1 Faure Street, Gardens, Cape Town 8001 (+27 21 480 9000, fritzhotel.co.za). Doubles from around \u00a351. Flights to Cape Town from London with South African Airways (0870 7471111, flysaa.com) from \u00a3503 return plus taxes. Robin Hutson, Co-founder of the Hotel du Vin chain (hotelduvin.com) Where would you like to be right now? We were about to escape to the Maldives, but our resort was badly damaged by the tsunami. So instead, we are heading off to Antigua for some Caribbean sun. Where will you stay? I'm a great fan of Gordon Campbell Gray's One Aldwych in London, and we're going to try out his Carlisle Bay (carlisle-bay.com). I like the concept of barefoot elegance in a hotel - I don't find anything too formal relaxing. At the same time, I like quality in terms of food and service. Not that it has to be out and out luxury, some of the places we stay, such as the Driftwood (driftwoodhotel.co.uk) in Cornwall, are desperately simple. What will you do? Very little! The usual beach stuff - have a good rest, hit the spa, try out the hobie cats, snorkel and round off the day with some nice food and wine. And I'll read. I'm probably the only person in the world who hasn't read The Da Vinci Code, but it looks like the ideal holiday book. \u00b7 Seasons in Style (0151-342 0505, seasonsinstyle.com) offers seven nights at Carlisle Bay from \u00a32,470, on a B&amp;B basis, including flights with British Airways and transfers. Shirley Spear, Runs The Three Chimneys restaurant and House Over-By on the Isle of Skye (threechimneys.co.uk) with her husband Eddie. Where would you like to be right now? We can only really get away during the winter because of work, and usually escape to Cyprus. I want to go there in the spring to see the blossom. Where do you stay? I adore the Columbia Beach Resort on Pissouri Bay on the south coast (columbia-hotels.com), somewhere with good facilities where we'll be warmly welcomed. There's masses on Cyprus to do. But if you want to stay put, it is all to hand at the Columbia - the location is great, and the staff look after us. What do you do there? Read, relax, swim and enjoy a glass or two of wine in the sunshine - everything we don't get the chance to do at home. I love the food on Cyprus - it's invariably fresh and locally grown, with salad and homemade bread put on the table as you sit down. And I'm afraid that being away gives my husband and I a chance to have management meetings and discuss what we'll do with The Three Chimneys in the following year. \u00b7 Argo Holidays (0870 066 7070, argoholidays.com) offers seven nights at the Columbia Beach Resort from \u00a3805 per person on a B&amp;B basis, including flights and transfers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
