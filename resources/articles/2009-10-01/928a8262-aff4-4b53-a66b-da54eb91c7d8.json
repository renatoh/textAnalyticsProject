County Durham-born actress Gina McKee reading poetry will be a pull for locals, her gentle tone contrasting nicely with the nasal whine of Ken Livingstone, who explains what lessons the cities of the Tyne can learn from London. More politics come from David Miliband and Hugh Pym, while Dr Tanya Byron can make it all seem better and artists Greyworld turn the venue into a sonic safari. The Sage, Fri to 25 Oct, bbc.co.uk/freethinking Bizarre Ball, London With tattoos and piercings considered mainstream these days, it takes a little extra effort to mark yourself out as a freak unique, but plenty will be made at Bizarre mag's annual ball. Des O'Connor hosts a range of entertainment \u2013 including Mexican wrestling, painful thrills with Psycho Cyborgs, Johnny Woo's camp cabaret, Dr Haze's Circus of Horrors, music from Japanese psycho-rockers Electric Eel Shock and lots of burlesque \u2013 all competing for the attention of corseted, latex-clad men and women. SeOne Club, SE1, Sat, visit bizarremag.com This Is Not A Gateway, London Exploring the urban landscape through the arts, this festival seeks to show how we interact with cities and what their futures will look like, as well as inspiring debate about their navigation and construction. The festival marks 20 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall with a look at post-communist cities, with tours, talks, film and performance. There are looks back at the flawed idealism of socialist design, but much of the festival's focus is very much forward-facing, with photographs of African London, discussion about female-designed cities and a road movie about London and Essex's very own Route 66, the A13.
