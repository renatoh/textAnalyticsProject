Wade has scored 16 tries in 20 matches this season and needs one more to equal Dominic Chapman\u2019s record set in the 1997-98 campaign. This week he was shortlisted for the Rugby Players\u2019 Association player of the year award but was snubbed last month by Gatland and Eddie Jones for the summer tours of New Zealand and Argentina respectively. The Wasps wing won his solitary England cap four years ago against the Pumas before he was seconded to the Lions as injury cover and while he has not featured in any of Jones\u2019s squads, with Jack Nowell, Anthony Watson and Elliot Daly picked by Gatland, the expectation was that he would go to Argentina. Instead Jones has named Denny Solomona, the London Irish teenager Joe Cokanasiga and Saracens\u2019 Nathan Earle \u2013 all of whom are uncapped \u2013 among his wingers while Gatland has picked George North, Liam Williams and Tommy Seymour alongside the aforementioned England trio. \u201cHe\u2019s been phenomenal this year, if a guy like that can\u2019t make England \u2026 I would have taken him on the Lions [tour],\u201d said Gopperth, one of three Wasps players up for the RPA award along with Wade and Daly. \u201cHe can make things happen and when you have a guy in the team like that, that can make a try out of nothing, that\u2019s x-factor and he\u2019s been brilliant for us this year. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to have someone like that in the squad. A guy with a bit of x-factor, if they took him down to New Zealand it adds a bit of spice. I really think that New Zealand would have seen him as a threat and would really have had to mark him. \u201cIt\u2019s something different within the squad, to just having hard-running wingers \u2013 if you have an out-and-out gas guy with really good feet it\u2019s really hard to defend. He should be there,\u201d added Gopperth. \u201cI just really enjoy watching him play. Give him the ball and try to catch him. He\u2019s a hard guy to tackle and he\u2019s been in phenomenal form. I\u2019m baffled as to how he got overlooked for certain international selections but he\u2019ll still be trying hard for Wasps for the rest of the season.\u201d Wade had touched down seven tries in his last seven matches but failed to score last week in the 32-13 defeat by Harlequins, which has put Wasps\u2019s hopes of a home semi-final in jeopardy despite topping the table for much of the season. Indeed, Wade touched the ball just twice against Harlequins and there is the growing sense that Wasps\u2019 attacking rhythm has been out of kilter since their comprehensive Champions Cup defeat by Leinster last month. They are still the top try-scorers in the Premiership by a distance but Wasps host the defending champions Saracens on Saturday and must avoid a first home defeat of the season to guarantee a top-two finish. \u201cWe know we have a very good attack,\u201d said the director of rugby, Dai Young, who has recalled Danny Cipriani at fly-half with Gopperth returning to inside-centre. \u201cWe have scored 114 tries in the two main competitions this season. To dispel the myth, we aren\u2019t changing the way we play but we recognise we don\u2019t want to give a team like Sarries 20-30 points and think we can score 40. \u201cWe will go in with an attacking mindset but also be a bit sensible, not to be so loose on occasions because we cause ourselves problems. We aren\u2019t going to beat Sarries at their game. We\u2019ve got to play to our strengths. \u201cWithout a shadow of a doubt our attack is a weapon, but we have to be sensible, we have to think about game management. And we have to make sure we cause them more problems than we cause ourselves.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
