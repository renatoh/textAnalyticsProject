Walsh is under growing pressure over the meagre return on the most expensive recruitment drive in the club\u2019s history. Everton have spent almost \u00a3200m in the past two transfer windows \u2013 only five clubs in Europe have spent more in that period \u2013 but are seven points above the relegation zone with 12 matches remaining. It is understood Walsh\u2019s position is under review by the owner, Farhad Moshiri. Marcel Brands, the sporting director at PSV Eindhoven, is a possible replacement. Saturday\u2019s 5-1 humiliation at Arsenal was the sixth time this season Everton have conceded four or more in a game. Allardyce described that defeat as \u201ca blip\u201d yet conceded the team\u2019s tendency to capitulate is a concern. \u201cIt is a worry, it is a big worry,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIt is a worry about the application and the consistency levels a player needs to perform at in the Premier League. \u201cThere is great play from Arsenal, there is no doubt about that, but there are times when you have to dig in. We talk about the ability of players but this is about the resilience and mental strength of a player when it is not going your way. Then you have to dig in and be able to stop the flow of the opposition and work your way through that and get back in the game. Not carry on conceding goals like we did.\u201d Allardyce admits Everton\u2019s new recruits \u201caren\u2019t gelling together like they should\u201d but claims the expenditure is not as excessive as it seems. When asked whether he expected more from such an expensively assembled squad, he replied: \u201cYes, but they [Arsenal] had three players worth \u00a3200m and they tore us apart. More than that. Ours is \u00a3200m but the net spend is \u00a3100m-110m max. Arsenal\u2019s is much higher than that. Ours is a big number and we should do better. We should certainly be more consistent but Arsenal have just spent \u00a360m on one centre-forward.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
