Andy Flower, the England team director, remains cautiously optimistic that they will be fit to play at the Gabba \u2013 and possibly even in the final warm-up fixture against an Invitational XI in Sydney. But Flower admitted nothing will be certain until Prior has had a scan and Pietersen a cortisone injection. Pietersen flew to Melbourne instead of Sydney hoping that the treatment would prove as successful, as it was in August, when an injection between the fourth and fifth Tests of the home Ashes series left him feeling \"like I've got a different knee\". Pietersen has previously had cortisone injections to help tackle spine and achilles problems but the right knee became a problem when he was forced to fly home from last winter's tour of New Zealand with deep bruising around the bone. He ended up missing home and away series against the Black Caps as well as the Champions Trophy but rejected having surgery because it would have ruled him out of consecutive Ashes series and now England must keep their fingers crossed that an injection will provide a short-term solution again. \"I don't think it's going to be a huge issue,\" said Flower. \"He's had a couple of these injections before and they've been successful \u2026 quietened the problem down. It's an ongoing issue for him but we anticipate this one being successful and anticipate him playing a full part in the Ashes tour.\" Pietersen first felt the problem in training before the start of the Australia A match on Wednesday but there was no obvious sign of him being impeded when he finally had his first bat of the tour on Saturday \u2013 even though he lasted 10 balls before falling lbw. Prior then gave England their second worry when he felt pain in his left calf after running a quick single with Joe Root. \"He is a concern,\" Flower said. \"Just from what I've seen, I'd imagine he will be OK for that first Test but I hope I'm not speaking out of turn there.\" Prior, England's vice-captain, who is two years younger than Pietersen at 31, has not missed a Test since March 2009, making 57 consecutive appearances. \"His experience is very valuable to us,\" said Flower. \"However, if he's injured and unavailable, [Jonny] Bairstow will step in. He is a very good young cricketer and will bring his own qualities to the England side.\" Australia's preparations for Brisbane received a boost when Shane Watson was cleared by their medical staff of any serious hamstring damage after pulling up when running into bowl during the last match of their one-day series in India. Darren Lehmann, Australia's coach, is confident Watson will be fit to play at the Gabba, although he has been withdrawn from the New South Wales team to face Queensland in the next round of Sheffield Shield fixtures and there are still doubts about whether he will be fit to bowl as much as he did in England. The International Cricket Council have confirmed that the New Zealander Billy Bowden, who has not stood in a Test match since he was dropped from the elite panel in June, will make a high-profile comeback during the series. He has been appointed for the third Test in Perth and will be the third umpire for the fourth Test in Melbourne."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
