Bravo's new magazine show covers boxing and cookery, relationships and health issues, rather than tits and bigger tits. You can find out about organic tomatoes, or discover how goalkeeper David James stays so focused in games (no, that's not a joke). But don't worry, they still manage to get in some gratuitous sex. You might even learn something, though if John Kerry is being described as metrosexual these days, surely it's all over. Martin Skegg ITV3 From 9pm According to the network bosses, ITV3 is \"not a golden oldies channel\", though it's not immediately obvious what else you might call something dedicated to running old episodes of A Touch of Frost. But it's not all like that. Quality old films are scheduled alongside popular stuff such as The Bill and Inspector Morse. You can find it on Freeview (34), NTL (118/8) and Telewest (116). Richard Vine Films Dr Strangelove, Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1963) 7.45am, 4pm, Sky Cinema 1 Kubrick's dark cold-war satire, with mad General Jack D Ripper (Sterling Hayden) launching a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union. Peter Sellers is US President Merkin Muffley, desperately trying to preserve the peace; he also plays loony adviser Strangelove and RAF pilot Lionel Mandrake. George C Scott's chief of staff can't see what all the fuss is about: \"No more than 10 or 20 million people will be killed.\" The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Peter Jackson, 2001) 2.40pm, 9.45pm, Sky Movies 1 The first chunk of Jackson's version of Tolkien's epic fantasy. Stunning New Zealand landscapes, CGI wizardry and awesome gothic design bring Middle Earth eye-bogglingly to the screen. The quest begins when Elijah Wood's hobbit Frodo Baggins and his friends set off to destroy the one ring, a WMD with bells on. Something nasty - ringwraiths, trolls, orcs - lurks around every corner. Film-making on a heroic scale. Au Revoir Les Enfants (Louis Malle, 1987) 6pm, FilmFour Malle's autobiographical tale is set in a Catholic school in occupied France. Gaspard Manesse plays 12-year-old Julien, deputed to look after an introverted new boy, Jean (Raphael Fejt\u00f6). As their friendship develops, Jean's secret emerges: he is Jewish, and is being hidden from the Germans by the head (Philippe Morier-Genoud). A sombre, delicate film. Crimson Tide (Tony Scott, 1995) 10pm, Sky Movies 2 A deep-sea face-off between veteran submarine commander Gene Hackman and his untried officer Denzel Washington. Skipper wants to nuke a Soviet missile base held by nationalist rebels; Denzel wants to pause and consider a little before starting the third world war. Plausibility takes a dive before the end, but Scott's thriller boasts a torpedo-fast script and hefty performances.
