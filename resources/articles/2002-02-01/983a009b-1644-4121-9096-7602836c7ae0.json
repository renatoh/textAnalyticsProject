Behind me, the 2,200m ridge that had taken our group 20 minutes to hike along after ducking under the boundary wire at the top of Le Tour, high in the Chamonix valley. Beneath me, an untracked powder run, dipping down into Posettes couloir - a buttock-clenching 40-degree slope filled with fresh snow but not much wider than a London bus. Encouragingly, our guide and instructor, British professional boarder Neil McNab, had christened it the Run of Vicious Savagery. A week earlier, neither untold riches nor a gun at my head would have got me anywhere near this spot. But by the time our group of eight spills through the trees at the bottom of the run into the Alpine hamlet of Le Buet, we are hooting like chimpanzees, eyes wide, grins enormous, hearts pumping, with the sheer rush of achievement. \"Nice work, guys,\" says Neil. \"You were all stylin' it down that.\" Only a bit, but we don't care. Because the negotiation of the couloir in one piece is only a part of the thrill. Just as satisfying is the realisation that we are all much better snowboarders than we were six days previously when we arrived in Chamonix for Neil's annual advanced technique clinic. What's more, we will be leaving armed with the knowledge to keep us progressing. Ask any skier and they will tell you how snowboarding is easier to learn than the two-plank version of downhill travel. But in boarding, as in skiing, it is common to progress only so far before hitting a plateau which many will find almost impossible to move beyond. After a couple of seasons of fairly regular riding, I had reached decent intermediate status. A couple of seasons later, however, and I was still a decent intermediate. I could get down most runs, I was comfortable on or off-piste, and I had even been known to go off the occasional jump. Sometimes I even landed them. But when the going got tricky, any semblance of technique or style deserted me. Of course, I could just have had a few more lessons, but to progress I needed more than a few technique tips. What I wanted to learn just as much was the ability to read the mountain, to match my riding to the terrain and to make the most of that terrain - natural rollers, steeps, whatever - to enhance the fun. On paper, Neil's credentials are impressive enough: 13 years as a professional boarder, four-times overall British champion, former top 20 World Cup finalist and chief trainer to the British Association of Snowboard Instructors. Since 1993, he has been on boardwear manufacturer Billabong's professional team, and also boasts sponsorship deals with, among others, Salomon and Oakley. But what really sets him apart as a teacher is his intimate knowledge of - and passion for - Chamonix and the incredible riding that the mountains around Mont Blanc have to offer. Since 1996, he and his sister Shelagh have been running the Kommunity snowboard camps, and for the last four years, Neil has lived there full time, basing the operation in a three-storey traditional chalet in Argenti\u00e8re at the top end of the Chamonix valley. The talk after dinner on the eve of our first day of riding sets the tone for the rest of the week. \"Snowboarding's dead easy,\" Neil says, \"but 95% of snowboarders don't know how to do it properly. The other 5% are all sponsored pro riders. By the end of this week, you're going to be riding like the top 5%.\" The clinics are designed to strip away all the bad habits picked up over years of boarding. In their place, Neil instills the bare essentials, the foundations upon which you can build the ability to ride anything with confidence and, crucially, style. So on the first day it's back to the very beginning. Before we have even left the chalet, the lessons begin, starting with stance. The key is simple biomechanics, apparently. Get the stance wrong, we are told, and we can forget any hope of progress. Half an hour of binding-twiddling later, we are at the top of an easy blue piste at Le Tour. For the next few hours, we ride slowly down this same run, as Neil gradually shows us how it should be done: riding through our feet only, initiating the turn, feeling the new edge coming in, digging the edge in to control the board through the turn and preparing for the next one. No dipped shoulders, no twisted hips and no in-turned knees. It sounds simple enough, but trying to get rid of four years of bad habits can be frustrating. My major error, Neil points out, is turning my back knee in and twisting my hips too far while riding on my toe edge. Yet no matter how hard I try to correct myself, nothing seems to work. As always, Neil has a strange but effective exercise up his sleeve. He tells me to put my back arm out like a rudder while riding and to clench and unclench my hand as if squeezing a tennis ball. This keeps me constantly aware of where my arm is. If I feel it creeping out in front of me, I'm twisting. To correct myself, I just bring my arm back round and push my back knee out over my foot. When it works, the feeling of effortlessly turning the board through my feet is revelatory. We spend the next few days practising these basic movements while being guided around La Fl\u00e9g\u00e8re and Le Br\u00e9vent. On every run, Neil throws in something new for us to try: one minute we are learning to \"ollie\" - using the springiness of the board's tail to get air - off jumps, the next we are tumbling down the hill like beginners as we try to ride \"switch\". That is, backwards. By the Wednesday, we are ready for a tougher test: a long, icy, off-piste run from the top of the Grands Montets cable car at 3,275m, skirting the edge of the Argenti\u00e8re Glacier. At times the scenery is so breathtaking that it is impossible to concentrate on technique: the shimmering aquamarine blues of the ice as the weak sunlight hits the glacier; the giant ice towers called seracs; the silence. When the snow starts falling, two glorious powder days follow, and technique lessons are replaced by straight-line competitions through the powder. School is over and it's all about fun now. First comes the Run of Justice, then the scarier Run of Fury, and by the end of Friday afternoon, we are standing at the bottom of the Run of Vicious Savagery. We might not be joining the top 5% on contracts yet, but each of us has made enormous progress, from getting our stance right to understanding - if not quite mastering - the science behind the perfect ollie. In the space of six days, Neil has guided us off the intermediate plateau and handed us a map to the dizzy heights of expert status. For the moment, we stand and gaze back upwards at the couloir, picking out our tracks to imprint on our brains a proper record of what our bodies have just conquered. Sitting above the summit of the Aiguillette des Posettes, a full moon is just taking shape against the darkening blue of the sky. No matter how long I snowboard, I doubt I'll ever have a better week in the mountains. McNab's top tips 1 Don't be afraid of messing about with your bindings so your body can move naturally without any tension or discomfort. 2 Don't twist your upper body to turn the board. Learn to control it by exerting pressure on the edges through your feet only. 3 Master the three basic building blocks: moving your weight to your front foot, initiating the turn by pressing down on heel or toe edge, and digging in the edge by bending the knees and pushing them out along the length of the board. 4 Keep your back arm out behind you like a rudder to stop you twisting your body. 5 Use the whole slope and plan each run to take in natural features such as rollers and jumps to help your riding and make it more fun. Try a different line every time. Way to go The course: McNab Mountain Sports (01546 830243) runs two technical clinics a year in Chamonix, one for improvers, the other for advanced.
