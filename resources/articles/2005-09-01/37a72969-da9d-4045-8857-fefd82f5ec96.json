This solo project originally appeared in 2000 as an album titled When We Were Young, but has been dusted off and polished up for 2005. However, the subject matter goes back much further - it was inspired by an attempt to both make music that could be appreciated by children and explore the innocent delights of his own childhood. So there are baby cries, Jackanory-like narratives about mums, gentle grooves and songs as comfortable as lullabies. While it's tempting to give the man a clip around the ear and tell him to grow up, the album has a womb-like calm, the instrumental passages even approaching the similarly childlike beauty of Virginia Astley's masterpiece, From Gardens Where We Feel Secure. Only the iffy raps and ubiquitous voice of Rollo's \"little sister\" Dido offers a jolting reminder of the family's more recent drift into adult-oriented concerns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
