More to the point, the amount of cash consumed by European banks yesterday was also outside the $50bn-$100bn (\u00a325bn-\u00a350bn) range that Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, had identified as the size of the potential losses from junk lending in the US mortgage market. Losses and money supply are different things, of course, but the moral is clear: nobody in the markets, including central banks, can say with confidence that they know where this crisis will end. In the thriller called Sub-prime Slime, the numbers seem to get bigger with each new chapter. The good news yesterday was that the ECB's action had a beneficial effect. The cost of borrowing overnight money fell, having soared as worried banks had held on to their cash. The ECB could claim it had performed its role effectively as a lender of last resort. And, despite some scary-looking falls in share prices and another rush towards the haven of government bonds, financial markets were shaken not felled. Yet those happy thoughts don't reflect the mood of many market players at the sharp end. Among investors in hedge funds, where we should expect a few tales of agony to emerge in coming weeks, there was dismay at the news from BNP Paribas. The French bank said it could not put an accurate value on three funds it manages. Why? The official explanation is that there are no prices because there is no trading. A sceptic would suspect something worse: bad numbers are always harder to add up than good ones. Either way, it's alarming. BNP is a grown-up bank. Its technology and quantitative models are regarded as among the best in the business. If it can't, or won't, put a price on its investments, it's a safe assumption that smaller hedge funds are also in the dark. Over the next week or so those same hedge funds will be reporting their performance figures for July. What is an investor to think when news comes of, say, a fall of 4%? The figure may look modest but is it genuine? On what basis is it calculated? And what will happen if our investor opts for caution and asks for his money to be returned? Will the hedge fund managers declare that redemptions are forbidden at this difficult time? That's what BNP did with its three funds. A freeze is legitimate - non-redemption clauses are common with hedge funds - but it is terrible for wider confidence. It encourages the idea that the time to get out is while the door is still open. When too many people think that way, panic can follow. Our investor might also listen to a few voices at the coalface, like Alan Ruskin's. He is chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, the part of Royal Bank of Scotland that deals in US mortgage-backed securities, and he sounds gloomy. \"Problems of appropriately marking to market [in other words, pricing investments accurately] are likely to be systemic, at least in the credit derivatives area,\" he said. \"If Ben Bernanke was right in alluding to sub-prime losses at $50bn-$100bn, then only a small percentage appears to have surfaced so far, and since he made those remarks, losses have likely extended across a much broader credit universe than sub-prime.\" He could have added that the slime has reached unlikely places. Yesterday Dutch merchant bank NIBC was the latest obscure continental European lender to confess. It has notched up losses of \u20ac137m (\u00a393m) on US asset-backed securities and warned the figure would rise. Why was a mid-sized Dutch bank playing in the US mortgage market in the first place? As with German bank IKB, which was supposed to be lending to local corporations, a picture is emerging of financial naivety. US banks wanted to export their toxic waste, and the Europeans bought the stuff. How much have they got? There is no way of knowing at the moment. Even IKB hasn't quantified the scale of its crisis, a week after it admitted it had a problem. The vacuum will be filled by rumour, and yesterday's gossip was that a large, frontline European bank has caught a nasty dose of sub-prime. Only time will tell. The optimists hope that markets will calm down once senior bankers return from their August holidays and remind the world that the global economy is still in decent shape. It's also true that a few institutions are building war chests to pounce on opportunities. French bank Axa and US private equity house Blue Mountain are two that are said to be setting up such \"defensive\" funds. There will be big winners in this story. At the moment, though, this clever money is sitting in the wings. It looks the best place to be. nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
