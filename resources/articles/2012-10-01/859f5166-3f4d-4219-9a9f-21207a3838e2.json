You'll find fine noir thrillers embedded in the landscape of austerity Britain, such as East End tragedy It Always Rains On Sunday, Next Of Kin or Cage Of Gold, in which Jean Simmons is led astray by an homme fatal. BFI Southbank, SE1, Mon to 30 Dec Africa In Motion, Edinburgh &amp; Glasgow Between Nollywood and the Arab spring, there are plenty of stories to tell in African cinema right now. However, in addition, this growing festival brings you African sci-fi, children's and art movies, including 20 British premieres, and films from Libya, Rwanda, Burkina Faso and Congo. Africa is literally in motion in festival closer Restless City, a visually ravishing study of west African immigrants in New York, while three teenagers travel a long way to escape rural poverty in opener Uhlanga, directed by South African writer Ndaba ka Ngwane (who'll be present). As for the sci-fi, picking up where District 9 left off, there are post-apocalyptic offerings such as \"Afro-samurai\" thriller Hasaki Ya Suda, Les Saignantes (set in Cameroon, circa 2025) or dreamy Kenyan fable Kichwateli. Edinburgh Filmhouse &amp; Glasgow Film Theatre, Thu to 2 Nov London International Animation Festival What with CGI infecting every frame of today's Hollywood blockbusters, it's getting harder to draw a neat line around animation, by hand or otherwise. But this festival sees that more as a tribute to animation's versatility. As well as a huge, diverse selection of treats from around the world, there are sections on animated documentary (including Father) and animation/live-action hybrids \u2013 both of which come into play with opening feature For No Good Reason, in which Johnny Depp meets the legendary Ralph Steadman. This is also the place to discover unsung greats such as self-taught Lithuanian pioneer Ladislas Starewitch and Japan's Koji Yamamura, who'll be holding a Q&amp;A and a masterclass. Barbican Screen, EC2, Thu to 4 Nov London Middle East And North African Film Festival The Arab-western gulf has been closing recently, thanks to the Arab spring and, in part, events like this. Cross-cultural ties are very much to the fore here, though the tone varies wildly. The 99 Unbound, for example, is an animated comic-book fantasy about kids with superpowers, rendered by a Kuwaiti-British team. Documentary Over The Wall, on the other hand, follows London students who connect with Egyptians via the universal language of football. There's space for shorts such as Ostora and work from lesser-sung countries including Libya, Algeria and Morocco, with many of their film-makers in town for discussions. Various venues, Fri to 2 Nov"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
