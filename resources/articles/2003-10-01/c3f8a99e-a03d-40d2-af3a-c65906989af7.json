It would be the first time this season that the Celtic manager could call on all of his senior players, after an injury-hit start to the season. Injuries have left him without the international quartet of Joos Valgaeren, Johan Mjallby, Stephen Crainey and Ulrik Laursen in defence. Paul Lambert, Steve Guppy and Jamie Smith have also been injured. But all have set their sights on the game in Brussels in three weeks' time. \"You always like your major players there, certainly defen sively,\" said O'Neill. \"You want that little bit of extra experience, and a couple of weeks should make a big difference. It will be good to have more players back, and in a couple of weeks that should give us more options.\" The next game cannot come quickly enough for Celtic, but O'Neill admitted their 2-0 victory over Lyon at Parkhead on Tuesday night was crucial to their chances of progressing to the knockout stages. They are now level on points with the French champions and only a point behind their opening-game conquerors Bayern Munich, who were held by Anderlecht on Tuesday. Confidence should be high for their trip to Brussels, but the Celtic manager believes that the outcome of Group A will be decided \"at the death\". \"I think very probably we had to win,\" O'Neill said. \"Defeat would have been bad for us but a draw wouldn't have been the end of the world. But we have achieved absolutely nothing so far. The group itself is wide open; everybody is in it, including Anderlecht.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
