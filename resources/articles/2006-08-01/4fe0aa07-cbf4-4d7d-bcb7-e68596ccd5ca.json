A digital tweak here or careful airbrush there could have us all looking like Brad Pitt or Scarlett Johansson - well almost. Now help is at hand from a group of Israeli computer scientists who have developed software that subtly massages the lines of a digital portrait to make a more pleasing image. \"Beauty is not in the eye of the beholder,\" said Daniel Cohen-Or at Tel Aviv University. \"There's a consensus about beauty across culture and age groups. We stretch the face a little bit. It's amazing to think how little it is and how much effect it has.\" The technique, which is reported in New Scientist, works along different lines to the retouching done by glossy magazines. These typically remove spots, blemishes and wrinkles. \"Everyone retouches pictures to some extent, but different magazines do it to different degrees,\" said Lindsay Frankel, the deputy editor of Company magazine. \"You can tell when someone has been really messed around with because you sort of lose their features though,\" she added. \"They start to look a bit cartoony.\" Prof Cohen-Or and his colleagues first trained their software in what people consider attractive by giving it a list of nearly 200 images of faces that had been rated for their attractiveness. The software extracts 250 features such as distance between the eyes and learns what combinations people like and dislike."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
