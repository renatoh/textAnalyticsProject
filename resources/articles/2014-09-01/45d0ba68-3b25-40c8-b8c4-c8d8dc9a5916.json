Spencer Ackerman combed over and annotated the Isis speech in full, to serve as a reader\u2019s guide to the fine print. Here are the seven key takeaways that underline exactly how Obama\u2019s Isis address falls down on too many fronts. Read the full document for more On Isis as a threat What Obama said: \u201cAt this moment, the greatest threats come from the Middle East and North Africa, where radical groups exploit grievances for their own gain. And one of those groups is Isil.\u201d What it really means: Strange that Obama didn\u2019t attempt to argue that Isis is the greatest of those threats. (Not like any other jihadist entity has conquered territory home to some six to eight million people.) If they\u2019re one threat amongst many, why go to war against them? On Isis as a threat on the homeland What Obama said: \u201cWhile we have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland, Isil leaders have threatened America and our allies.\u201d What it really means: So Isis isn\u2019t an imminent threat to the US, something the Department of Homeland Security and the National Counterterrorism Center have conceded in recent days. The Americans at risk from Isis are the ones in Iraq at Obama\u2019s orders, risking the outcome they have been sent to prevent. Isis appears overwhelmingly interested in building what it claims is its state in Iraq and Syria, not exporting terrorism. All this makes the current war a preventive one, which international law tends to consider illegal and illegitimate without United Nations sanction, regardless of the venality of the foe or the assemblage of the coalition of nations against it. On US objectives What Obama said:\u201cOur objective is clear: we will degrade and ultimately destroy Isil through a comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy.\u201d What it really means: Alas, it\u2019s not a clear objective. It depends on where you put the emphasis \u2013 degrading or destroying. Obama has phrased missions like this before to avoid over-promising: famously, with his 2009 \u201cdisrupt, dismantle and defeat\u201d objective against al-Qaida. How does the US know when its job is finished? Will Isis still exist in some diminished form at its end? Will Isis hold any territory at all? How \u201cultimately\u201d is ultimately, and will that \u201cultimate\u201d destruction occur before or after the US stops lobbing missiles? And so forth. On air strikes in Syria What Obama said: \u201cThat means I will not hesitate to take action against Isil in Syria, as well as Iraq.\u201d What it really means: Big question: who will spot US missile strikes in Syria if there won\u2019t be US troops there? The CIA? Syrian opposition groups? Additionally, Syria strikes are likely to take some time to occur, as intelligence necessary for targeting matures. On involving Congress What Obama said:\u201cAcross the border, in Syria, we have ramped up our military assistance to the Syrian opposition. Tonight, I again call on Congress to give us additional authorities and resources to train and equip these fighters\u201d What it really means: Specifically, Obama is asking for $500m, and it\u2019s notable that he\u2019s not telling the American public anything in this speech about the cost of this latest war. Also on involving Congress What Obama said:\u201cBut I believe we are strongest as a nation when the President and Congress work together. So I welcome Congressional support for this effort to show the world that Americans are united in confronting this danger.\u201d What it really means: Notice how Obama has framed congressional support as optional, an inversion of constitutional obligation. Obama, a former constitutional law professor, has declared that he has all the authority he needs \u2013 within Iraq, at least; he wants Congress to authorise and fund US military training of Syrian rebels - yet the wellspring of that authority is a 2001 authorisation against al-Qaida, and Isis is no longer part of al-Qaida. \u201cExtremely implausible\u201d, wrote the Brookings Institution\u2019s Benjamin Wittes. On international support What Obama said: \u201cAnd in two weeks, I will chair a meeting of the UN Security Council to further mobilize the international community.\u201d What it really means: Obama didn\u2019t commit to seeking a United Nations resolution to bless Iraq War III itself. On Yemen and Somalia What Obama said:\u201cThis strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one we have consistently and successfully pursed in]Yemen and Somalia for years.\u201d What it really means: Very few people who are not part of the administration consider either of those cases a success. Less subjectively, neither has finished, years later, and it is unclear what success in Yemen and Somalia even is. Obama: \u201cMay God bless our troops, and may God bless the United States of America\u201d And with those 14 words, Obama inaugurated the Third Iraq War, after winning the presidency on a pledge to end the Second."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
