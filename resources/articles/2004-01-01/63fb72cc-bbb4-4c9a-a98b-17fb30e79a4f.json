It reads like something from the Onion, but seems deadly serious. Cable TV made a West Bend man addicted to TV, caused his wife to be overweight and his kids to be lazy, he says. And he's threatening to sue the cable company. Timothy Dumouchel of West Bend wants $5,000 or three computers, and a lifetime supply of free Internet service from Charter Communications to settle what he says will be a small claims suit. Dumouchel blames Charter for his TV addiction, his wife's 50-pound weight gain and his children's being \"lazy channel surfers,\" according to a Fond du Lac police report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
