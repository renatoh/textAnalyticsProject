Humphreys, holidaying in New Zealand with her husband, travelled 80 miles from Auckland to Hamilton to attend a casting session for extras in the forthcoming Hobbit film. She had to queue for three hours. Three hours! To be a hobbit! Just imagining 700 hobbit-sized people, eyes bright with hope, snaking down the pavement as far as the eye can see, gives me a little hit of pleasure. But at the end of this queue, a casting agent turned Humphreys, a Briton of Pakistani descent, away \u2013 with, it is reported, the words: \"We are looking for light-skinned people. I'm not trying to be . . . whatever. It's just the brief. You've got to look like a hobbit.\" Humphreys, presumably convinced she looked like a hobbit, was outraged. Her heartbreak might have been similar to that felt by the one-legged Tarzan wannabe in the Pete and Dud sketch, hopping away frantically only to be told: \"I've got nothing against your right leg. The trouble is \u2013 neither have you.\" Humphreys saw something more sinister. \"It's 2010,\" she told a reporter for the Waikato Times. \"I still can't believe I'm being discriminated against because I have brown skin.\" On hearing this, the film's production company went into damage-limitation mode, making clear that casting Aryan hobbits was \"not something we instructed or condoned\", and sacking the casting agent. There are two natural responses to this story. One righteously rejoices at the casting agent losing her job, and is gobsmacked that anyone would do the equivalent of posting a \"No dogs, no blacks, no Irish\" sign outside an open casting call for a film and expect to get away with it. Another is to go the Full Littlejohn and regard it as another instance of the grotesque power of the \"PC brigade\", before wondering, in satirical mode, what next. No more blacking up to play Othello? Blond-haired Oompa-Loompas? Neither of these responses seems quite right. The casting call was a mare's nest of possible discrimination issues in any case. The production company, even as it deplored the introduction of a colour bar, was courting problems by declaring: \"All people meeting the age and height requirements are welcome to audition for The Hobbit.\" Even more bizarrely, it's reported that the instruction that hobbits be \"light-skinned\" was confined to female hobbits, which, as well as being genetically implausible, is nakedly sexist. There's also the question \u2013 a vexed one in the case of a fantasy film \u2013 of accuracy. Humphreys herself has piled in on the question of hobbit genetics, saying: \"Obviously, hobbits are not brown or black or any other colour. They all look kind of homogenised beige and are all derived from the Caucasian gene pool.\" This remark opens a whole other can of hobbits. On that count, I'm grateful for this newspaper's scholarly report, which stated that, inasmuch as Tolkien hinted at hobbit skin tone, Harfoots were \"browner\" than Fallohides. I'm not sure where that gets us, though. The hobbits in The Hobbit are from the Shire, making them the (less brown) Fallohides \u2013 though the fact that a browner version even existed makes you think twice about jumping to conclusions about what Tolkien thought. Does it make one a recruiting sergeant for the BNP to have supposed that Tolkien probably thought of his hobbits as white, though? The Shire, after all, was Tolkien's version of a sort of pre-Edwardian rural England: stuffed with hairy-footed, pipe-smoking, moleskin-trouser-wearing, unworldly, pig-ignorant yokels who dwelt in cosy holes in the ground surrounded by overfilled furniture, decorative knick-knacks and back issues of The Hobbit Reader's Digest. It was a vision that was retro even when put together; and The Hobbit was published 11 years before the Windrush put in at Tilbury docks. One feels for Humphreys: she has lost a whole day of her life queuing up to be a hobbit. One feels, too, for the casting agent, who has lost her whole job. On balance, erring on the side of inclusiveness would have been the kind and sensible thing to do, but it's not impossible to understand how she made the call she did. It's claimed, though I can find no trace of it, that Humphreys has now set up a Facebook page called: \"Hire Hobbits of all colours! Say no to Hobbit racism!\" That is a rallying cry worthy of the battle of Helm's Deep in The Lord of the Rings, and a reminder that, above all else, you don't want to piss off a Tolkien nerd. It does all make me wonder what happened during casting for the forthcoming live-action 3D Smurfs movie, out next summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
