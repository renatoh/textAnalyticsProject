The San Antonio Spurs\u2019 87-79 win over the Golden State Warriors on Saturday was something of a grind rather than the exhibition of beauty that many had hoped for heading into the heavily hyped game. The result, however, ensured that there would be plenty of drama remaining in the regular season and, quite possibly, in the playoffs as well. For starters, Saturday night\u2019s victory proved that San Antonio can actually beat Golden State, something which was in doubt after the Warriors blew out a Tim Duncan-less Spurs team back in January. While many basketball analysts have come to the reasonable conclusion that San Antonio is the team with the best chance, perhaps the only chance, to knock off Golden State, that theory looked awfully shaky after that 120-90 beatdown. Their postseason chances would have looked even worse had the Spurs managed to lose on Saturday night. The Warriors, after all, were playing on the road, without Andre Iguodala and Andrew Bogut, on the second night of a back-to-back. Instead, the Spurs evened the season series at 1-1. The Warriors suffered through their lowest scoring game of the season. San Antonio\u2019s defense limited their shooting \u2013 Golden State were just 37.8% from the field \u2013 while Steph Curry went ice cold, going one-for-12 from beyond the three-point line. If there was a single moment in the game that poked a hole into the Warriors\u2019 well-established aura of invincibility, it was Danny Green blocking a Curry three-point attempt, something which hadn\u2019t happened all season long. Even though they actually scored fewer points in Saturday\u2019s win than they did during January\u2019s loss, the Spurs\u2019 offense looked much improved as well. San Antonio\u2019s LaMarcus Aldridge, who played like a clueless newbie in their last meeting, scored a game high 26 points in the contest. Head coach Gregg Popovich also showed off his willingness to make unusual adjustments, benching franchise icon Duncan in favor of Boris Diaw, who scored 12 points and picked up eight rebounds in the game. (Duncan ended up played just eight minutes in the game, suggesting that his absence in the earlier loss against the Warriors maybe wasn\u2019t as big of a factor as it seemed at the time.) While it was a much needed victory for San Antonio, it could end up being more significant as a setback in Golden State\u2019s quest for the best regular season record in NBA history. Before Saturday\u2019s loss, the Warriors were on pace to beat the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls\u2019 72-10 record. The Warriors are now at 62-7, and can only afford to lose two of their remaining 13 games. This might actually be good news for the NBA, as a decrease in their margin of error has only increased the much-watch factor of every Warriors game for the foreseeable future. While earlier in the year some worried that the Warriors would end up resting Curry or other key players for the postseason rather than make a push for 73-9, Saturday\u2019s loss could have made it unlikely that they will pursue that strategy. Golden State might not be able to afford to rest players down the stretch, because the top seed in the Western Conference is still up for grabs. The Warriors and Spurs play two more games against each other, which is big because Saturday\u2019s win improved San Antonio\u2019s record to 59-10. That means, despite the fact that the Warriors are having maybe the best regular season ever, they remain only three games up in the standings. Should the Spurs win both of their remaining games against the Warriors, a difficult but not completely improbable task, they would win the season series. In that case, the Spurs would only have to tie the Warriors\u2019 regular season record to clinch the No1 seed. That could end up having huge playoff ramifications because the top-seeded team would have home court advantage throughout the playoffs. That would be particularly meaningful in this situation, since both the Spurs and the Warriors remain undefeated at home this season. The Warriors, in fact, haven\u2019t won a regular season game in San Antonio since 1997, although they can take some comfort in the fact that they did win a playoff game at AT&amp;T Center back in 2013. San Antonio, meanwhile, knows exactly what the worst case scenario can be if you\u2019re forced to play a Game 7 on the road. If the Spurs had lost on Saturday, it probably wouldn\u2019t even be worth talking about any of these scenarios, but they didn\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean that the Warriors are no longer the overwhelming favorite to win the NBA Finals. They still are. A Warriors fan could point out, rightfully, that the Spurs were facing an undermanned, exhausted Warriors team at home and Golden State still managed to keep things close. What the Spurs\u2019 Saturday night win does do is that it make it clear that these next few weeks will not end up being an anticlimactic coronation in California. The possibility of failure is now officially in play for the Warriors, and the NBA is better off for that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
