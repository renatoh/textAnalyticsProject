Basso told Judge Julia Santamaria that he agreed to a complex treatment with Eufemiano Fuentes that cost \u20ac70,000 ($94,000) for one year in 2005, adding he knew it \"was not a good thing to do\". Basso, who was given a two-year doping suspension in 2007, said he paid Fuentes an initial \u20ac15,000 ($20,000) in cash but was unable to finish the treatment because the police investigation interrupted it. \"I contacted Dr Fuentes because his system could give me an advantage in cycling,\" Basso said. \"I acknowledge that on my account it was a weakness, a weakness so as to pursue a dream to win [the Tour de France].\" Basso won the Giro in 2006 and then again in 2010 after serving his doping ban. He said Fuentes and another doctor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Merino, had told him the treatment \"was exactly like donating blood\" but he chose to keep the treatment secret from his team and family. \"Only Fuentes, Merino and I knew,\" he said. \"Obviously I knew it wasn't a good thing to do.\" To protect his identity, Basso said he used his dog's name, Birillo, to mark his blood bags with. Fuentes is the key figure and one of five defendants in the case, which stems from a police raid in 2006 that uncovered blood bags and other doping equipment and implicated many of the world's top cyclists. No riders are on trial because of the legal limitations of the case, as doping was not illegal in Spain at the time. The German cyclist Joerg Jaskche also gave the court on Monday a detailed description of how blood transfusions were performed by Fuentes \u2013 the kind of step-by-step explanation that many critics said had been lacking in the trial. Jaskche, who was one of the first riders to admit that he had doped with the help of Fuentes, said the Spanish doctor extracted blood from him and provided transfusions and other performance-enhancing substances on up to 15 occasions in 2005-06. He said the techniques involved extracting blood from riders' veins and later to re-inject just the red blood cells or sometimes just the plasma. \"Blood was first extracted, then a month later some more was extracted, then the old removed blood would be transfused,\" he said. \"This would allow my blood levels to be restored.\" Jaskche said Fuentes's services were much sought after by riders and recalled looking at a map during one Tour de France race, saying he could \"barely make out the shape of France\" because of all the written annotations pinpointing where riders had agreed to set up doping stops. Both Jaskche and Basso said the transfusions often had to be rushed to avoid detection. \"Sometimes when we were in a hurry and the blood bag hadn't reached the right temperature, my arm would get cold and when I got home I wouldn't feel too well,\" he said. Jaskche's testimony contradicted that of Fuentes on some key points. Fuentes has admitted that he supplied blood doping to riders but said it was for health reasons \u2013 not for performance enhancement. Fuentes told the court he performed transfusions after riders had withdrawn from a race due to exhaustion and only to stop them from suffering physical damage as a result of muscular over-exertion. However, Jaskche said he had received blood doping while racing in Germany in 2005 and that this was clearly meant to enhance performance. He said that, although the doping in Germany was not provided by Fuentes himself, it was done by one of the Spanish doctor's collaborators whom he identified as \"Dr Choena\". The German said that initially no payment was taken by Fuentes, leading him to assume that his team was taking care of the cost. Jaskche said he began later on to pay for the treatment himself, from small amounts in cash to larger sums which he transferred to what he said was Fuentes's Swiss bank account."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
