It\u2019s seen as Theresa May\u2019s bid to create a permanent legacy in her final weeks in office. While this target is still too slow, it\u2019s a step in the right direction. Yet just days ago, her chancellor, Philip Hammond, raised concerns about the plan. In a leaked letter to May, he said the bill for moving to a zero-carbon economy would be upwards of \u00a31tn. To caution about costs is a standard Treasury response to anything. But Hammond\u2019s intervention, since he\u2019s on the centrist wing of a party that appears to be moving ever further to the right, is particularly disquieting. If even he doubts that saving the planet is money well spent, what about the rest of his party? It calls into question whether this government can be relied on to reach its green targets. So, on what grounds is his scepticism based? The \u00a31tn is based on official estimates that reaching net zero would cost \u00a350-70bn a year by 2050 \u2013 about 1-2% of GDP. However, this number includes the investment that would come from both the public and the private sector. So the impression that government would foot the entire bill is just wrong. What\u2019s more, the Committee on Climate Change \u2013 the government\u2019s emissions watchdog \u2013 is clear that, due to the falling cost of low-carbon technology, reaching net zero would cost no more than the 2008 Climate Change Act had committed us to. Yet there is no mention of this in Hammond\u2019s letter. Ultimately, the Treasury must be the linchpin of the green transition, but this letter shows that this department just does not get it. There was no sense of urgency, no recognition of the imperative to decarbonise and asking whether we can afford to do this misses the point. Yes, there will be costs associated with reaching net zero. We must be honest and open about this. But the key question is whether we can afford not to reach net zero. If the science is right, then the answer is no. The more that global temperatures rise, the more chaos in the system: more devastating hurricanes, record droughts, extreme floods, disappearing coastlines, loss of crops. Climate-related poverty will spread across the world at a scale we can\u2019t even imagine. The cost of this, not just in cash but in human suffering, will far outstrip the cost of transitioning to a zero-carbon economy. Therefore the choice is whether we take action now to achieve the change we need, or sleepwalk into a crisis and throw money at the problem when it will be too late. The green transition presents a huge opportunity. Reducing carbon emissions across the world could unlock up to \u00a32.8tn of investment a year. The global market for low carbon electricity generation is due to expand rapidly in the next 10 years. And the market for low emissions vehicles alone is set to grow even faster each year. The potential to take a slice of this growing pie is clear. Why not invest in taking carbon out of our economy in a way that creates millions of good jobs and lifts living standards? But all of this will require significant government action \u2013 from large-scale investment in infrastructure and technology, to incentives to bend markets towards the climate imperative. This simply won\u2019t happen without the government, and the Treasury, making the green transition its core mission \u2013 with investment paid for by progressive taxation and effective borrowing. It will mean shifting the mandate of the Bank of England so it can play its part in directing finance away from dirty to clean investment, with fiscal and monetary policy working hand in glove. And it will mean focusing every chancellor\u2019s budget for the foreseeable future on emissions cuts. So whatever Hammond thinks, if the government is to deliver on its 2050 target date, his successors will have to abandon his complacency and get 100% behind it. \u2022 Miatta Fahnbulleh is chief executive of the New Economics Foundation"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
