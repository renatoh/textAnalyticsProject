Porter, the social services minister, was speaking on ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program, which addressed calls by Theresa May for increased anti-terrorism powers, such as preventative detention and greater regulation of internet-based radicalisation after the latest London terrorist attacks. The panel included three federal politicians \u2013 Porter, the Labor MP Anthony Albanese and the Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm \u2013 as well as La Trobe University professor Judith Brett and the actor and disability advocate Kiruna Stamell. Porter said May had made \u201ca very valid point\u201d about the voluntary carriage of hatred on the internet by services and sites such as Google and Twitter. \u201cWe cannot allow this ideology the safe space to breed but that is precisely what the internet and the big companies that provide internet-based services provide,\u201d May said in London. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, agreed and said there was too much tolerance of online extremist material and cooperation was needed from the tech companies. \u201cIf you operate a carriage service, surely you must bear some responsibility \u2013 at least at an ethical level \u2013 to ensure you\u2019re not carrying that sort of hatred over your communication network,\u201d Porter said on Monday night. He said governments could work with internet companies and it was something that \u201cneeded to be developed further\u201d. Porter said the government would give \u201cdue consideration\u201d to calls for greater preemptive powers but with caution regarding personal freedoms. Asked if Labor would support sweeping new powers like those called for by May, Albanese said the opposition wouldn\u2019t make policy on the run and the two parties were working successfully in a bipartisan way. He said the struggle against totalitarian fascism wasn\u2019t won by \u201ccompletely giving up your freedoms\u201d. Leyonhjelm urged against curtailing freedoms in the name of protection and said he was uncomfortable with control orders but preferred them to preventative detention orders. \u201cThe thing is, of course, these terrorists, Salafists and Wahhabists from the Sunni side of Islam \u2026 they want to destroy our freedoms,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we give them up, [they have] won, and if we do it to ourselves that\u2019s doubly bad.\u201d Brett, an emeritus professor of politics, urged people to accept that authorities would not always successfully stop attacks. \u201cIt\u2019s really extremely difficult and we mustn\u2019t blame them when attacks happen,\u201d she said. The panel also discussed US president Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. Leyonhjelm said he agreed with Trump and the deal would shut down Australian industry and raise electricity prices. Porter said the government had committed to stay in and it was \u201cabsolutely still a worthwhile global process\u201d. Albanese said Leyonhjelm\u2019s idea that the accord damaged Australia\u2019s economy was \u201cfrankly wrong\u201d. He said other market-based mechanisms were needed to drive change, including an emissions intensity scheme. Separately, Porter was quizzed on the NDIS and difficulties for people dealing with it. \u201cHow will this system resist perpetuating inequalities when those least well off are least able to advocate for themselves?\u201d a questioner, who had two daughters signed up to the scheme, asked. The questioner said she believed in the system and its premise but it was \u201ca very hard fight to get what was needed\u201d for her daughters. \u201cI see people who don\u2019t have strong advocates and their needs are less met than my children\u2019s.\u201d Porter said the scale of the enterprise was immense and a \u201conce in a generation\u201d logistical feat, and the task was to ensure planning and reviews of plans were \u201cconsistently high across Australia\u201d. He said he didn\u2019t have any \u201cstatistical information\u201d to support or refute the suggestion that those who were or had better advocates got a better result. Stamell said such bureaucratic systems were always difficult. \u201cOne thing Australia has got in its favour rather than the UK system, which has been damaged recently by politics and political agendas, is because it\u2019s a bit of a new system it can be built better,\u201d she said. Asked about the government\u2019s controversial plan to drug test welfare recipients and put people on income management if they were found to be using drugs, Albanese said he was concerned about the motive behind the policy. \u201cThis came from nowhere and this government does have bit of a track record of vilification of people receiving welfare benefits and I\u2019m a bit concerned this is the latest instalment of that.\u201d He said Labor would look at the detail of the proposal. The minister in charge of the policy, Porter, said it was about improving people\u2019s lives and Department of Human Services intervention with treatment plans would assist people found to be using drugs, and that people weren\u2019t currently given assistance. \u201cThe idea that drug use doesn\u2019t create a barrier to drug use is utter nonsense,\u201d he said. Albanese said: \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of drug use in the eastern suburbs among employed people in the city.\u201d Stamell suggested drug-testing politicians. Porter said that decision wasn\u2019t up to him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
