The analysis by the Australia Institute, released on Monday, found that in 2024-25, the first year of the controversial third stage of the government\u2019s tax plan, men will pocket $11bn in income tax cuts while women receive just $6bn. Income tax cuts are the first order of business when parliament resumes in the first week of July but the Coalition and Labor are locked in a high stakes game of chicken, with both warning cuts for low and middle income earners should not be delayed by political posturing over the final stage. The Morrison government\u2019s income tax package is divided into three parts: the first stage provides a tax offset to benefit low and middle income earners from 2019 to 2022; the second stage raises the 19% tax bracket threshold from $41,000 to $45,000 from 2022; and the third stage flattens tax brackets from 2024 so everyone earning between $45,000 to $200,000 would pay a marginal rate of 30%. While Labor has agreed to the first stage and is open to the second, it has thus far balked at stage three, demanding to know how much of the tax cuts will flow to high-income earners in a bid to pressure the government to split the bill. Crossbench demands for a new coal power station or gas reservation have been rebuffed by the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, who has refused to horse trade or split the bill, pressuring Labor to pass the cuts in full. The Australia Institute found that, because the tax cuts in the third stage flow mainly to high-income earners, men get most of the benefit because males are more likely than females to earn higher incomes. The distributional analysis by senior economist Matt Grudnoff found the top 10% of income earners will get 31% of the tax cut in stage three, of which 23% goes to males and 8% goes to females. The benefits of the first stage of the tax plan are \u201calmost equal\u201d, with 47% going to women and 53% to men, it said. \u201cWhen stage two begins in 2022-23 the female share falls \u2026 to 43%. When stage three begins the female share falls to 36%.\u201d Grudnoff said \u201cthe final stages of these tax cuts will further entrench gender inequality\u201d. \u201cWith the slowing economy, the government needs to be clever with its fiscal stimulus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tax cuts to high-income earners in 2024-25 are not well targeted and are too far off to help the economy right now.\u201d On Friday the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, wrote to the government asking the total cost of tax cuts and how much would flow to people earning $180,000 or more. Chalmers cited estimates by the Australia Institute that high-income earners would receive $77bn of the benefit, while the Grattan Institute has put the figure at $89bn and the ANU\u2019s Centre for Social Research and Methods had suggested $88bn. \u201cAs you know, Labor stands ready to urgently pass the first tranche of tax cuts to address the weakness in the economy on your watch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe require this additional information to properly consider the latter stages before making final decisions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
