To her surprise, the notorious property is snapped up for far more than it is worth after a bidding war. \"Home of mass murderer\" made for a far more enticing selling point than a backyard pool. The plot detail was depressingly accurate. Owing to the absence of any law in Massachusetts that bans profiting from crime, PrisonBoundSerialKillers.com this month begins selling \"murderabilia\" such as dirt dug from the grave of the man who claimed to be the Boston Strangler. The site joins others, such as murderauction.com, that exploit a legal loophole common to most US states. Aimed primarily at stopping criminals from securing book and film deals that capitalise on the American public's ghoulishness, so-called \"Son of Sam\" laws do not forbid the sale of trinkets that killers fashion after they've been put away. In the olden days, convicts made car number plates. Now Lee Malvo, the sniper who terrorised motorways around Washington, DC, whiles away the hours sketching self-portraits that he sells on the web for $30 (\u00a315). The schizophrenic cross-dresser, serial killer and self-proclaimed human-blood drinker Hadden Clark flogs drawings of Bugs Bunny. One collector of these morbid talismans boasts of having commissioned the killer-cannibal John Wayne Gacy to draw a portrait of his own two-year-old son. You can't blame the perps for their enterprise. It's the demand side of this equation that's deserving of scrutiny. In a sane world, nobody pays $150 for an 8x10 glossy of Mark Chapman praying, signed by John Lennon's killer himself. The superstitious might more sensibly regard these items as hexed. But many Americans are cheerfully oblivious of the distinction between glory and infamy. Indeed, it's telling that the very word \"notorious\" is so commonly misused in the US that most people think it means \"famous\". The good news is that most of this junk goes for chump change. A jailhouse letter from China Arnold, who cooked her infant daughter in a microwave, goes for less than \u00a35. The question is, what's driving down prices? Do Americans place little value on sicko souvenirs, or is the country so awash in handicrafting psychopaths that the market is flooded?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
