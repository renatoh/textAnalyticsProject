Having risen to stardom via his debut album 2Pacalypse Now and 1993 commercial breakthrough Strictly 4 My NIGGAZ, the Californian rapper was now on trial for possession of illegal weapons and sexual assault after a woman accused him and his entourage of raping her in a New York hotel room 12 months earlier. The jury was almost ready to deliver its verdict, and the planned recording session \u2013 with Brooklyn MC Little Shawn \u2013 promised a brief respite from these legal woes, and to net the rapper a much-needed $7,000. But as Tupac entered the lobby at Quad Studios, three waiting gunmen opened fire. He survived, and accused New York gangsta rap figurehead Christopher \u201cBiggie Smalls\u201d Wallace of setting up the hit. This ignited a conflict between hip-hop\u2019s east and west coast factions that would outlive its key protagonists; Tupac was shot dead in September 1996 and Biggie was killed in a drive-by the following March. Both murders remain unsolved. \u201cThey were two of the biggest celebrities of the 90s,\u201d says Joel Anderson, culture journalist and host of the latest season of Slate\u2019s acclaimed podcast Slow Burn, which investigates the lives and deaths of Tupac and Biggie, AKA Notorious BIG. \u201cThey were black. They died so young. And we still don\u2019t have any resolution about what both their careers and their deaths meant.\u201d Anderson is a reporter in search of that closure. Where the first two series of Slow Burn, presented by Leon Neyfakh, explored the respective impeachment trials of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, season three exits the White House to examine what Anderson describes on the show as \u201ca friendship gone bad that turned into a nationwide turf war\u201d. Anderson heard the news of Tupac\u2019s death while driving home from college. \u201cAll the people on the radio were crying,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was just this huge outpouring of grief. And I remember this paucity of information, not being able to get the information on it that I wanted. That\u2019s the way things happened back then. There wasn\u2019t the proliferation of media. I didn\u2019t even have a cellphone.\u201d Slow Burn does not play the story as some whodunnit. \u201cIf people think we\u2019re gonna solve it, they\u2019ll be disappointed,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the show to be some kind of autopsy. A lot of documentaries and books have focused on that aspect, and have all ended up at the same place. We have a rough idea of what happened, but it\u2019s doubtful these murders will ever be solved. The police couldn\u2019t do it. But we won\u2019t run away from discussing what happened there \u2013 and why it wasn\u2019t solved. And we\u2019re gonna talk about how some don\u2019t even believe Tupac is dead in the first place,\u201d he adds, referencing conspiracy theories that the rapper had faked his death (a scenario that inspired one of comic Dave Chappelle\u2019s best sketches). Instead of re-raking the over-familiar \u201cTupac v Biggie\u201d narrative, Anderson approaches his subject from new angles. Just as Slow Burn\u2019s first two series brought to life the fevered eras of Watergate and the Lewinsky scandal, Anderson says the third aims to \u201cexamine and unearth strange subplots and the hidden characters of the story\u201d, focusing on unexplored details and bringing the background to the foreground. At the podcast\u2019s centre is a US still reeling from the 1992 LA riots, and in the grip of moral hysteria over gangsta rap. We meet lawyers who tried to keep defendants accused of killing police officers away from death row by citing the influence of rap, and hear the actor and National Rifle Association (NRA) spokesperson Charlton Heston reciting the lyrics to Ice-T\u2019s Cop Killer in his campaign to get the rapper\u2019s band Body Count kicked off their record label. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think there were Capitol Hill hearings about the music of the Geto Boys and Tupac,\u201d Anderson says, of the era\u2019s febrile mood. \u201cBut gangsta rap was much more explicit about what was going on in the artists\u2019 communities, talking about real violence, real sexism, real police brutality \u2013 things that people did not talk about in that way before. It was jarring. But it\u2019s incredible to listen to the audio of those hearings; they really thought Tupac was gonna encourage a whole generation of cop killers.\u201d The podcast also investigates the issues that gave rise to gangsta rap and the shockwaves it sent. \u201cWe\u2019re exploring the over-policing of minority communities, the discourse over what is or isn\u2019t acceptable for the \u2018public square\u2019, and issues of sexism and misogyny,\u201d he says. \u201cTupac is a guy who went to prison after being convicted of sexual abuse, who raised the stakes of the beef by boasting that he slept with Biggie\u2019s wife Faith Evans [on the 1996 track Hit \u2019Em Up]. The violent sexism in this story is something people really didn\u2019t grapple with at the time; nobody sat down and said: \u2018He\u2019s using a woman as a pawn in a revenge scheme against his enemy. There\u2019s a problem with that.\u2019\u201d Anderson\u2019s wide-ranging and restless deep dive turns up vivid details and powerful vignettes. Tupac is cavity-searched by prison guards in front of his attorney, purely to humiliate him. Lest his ears be sullied, a judge wears earplugs as Tupac\u2019s Soulja\u2019s Story is played as evidence during a trial involving the murder of a policeman. Veteran civil-rights activists demand gangsta rappers be censored, and stage the ceremonial destruction of their tapes and CDs. But Slow Burn\u2019s focus on the wider picture never loses sight of its central characters. Anderson describes Tupac as \u201cfearless, to the point of recklessness\u201d, depicting him as mercurial, brilliant and troubled. \u201cHe\u2019s endlessly fascinating. The emotion and pain he put into his music spoke to people. To my interviewees, he was like a whirlwind that changed their lives, no matter how long or brief their relationship,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cMeanwhile, with Biggie, the stories people told about him were about hanging out with him, smoking weed and eating pizza in the neighbourhood where he was born, lived and died. People were awed by Tupac, but they felt so much warmth for Biggie; he touched them deeply.\u201d It is a story that Anderson believes contains lessons for the US and that still resonates two decades on. \u201cI keep thinking of the Black Lives Matter movement,\u201d he says. \u201cWe still don\u2019t appreciate or protect black lives the way we do others. We\u2019re still grappling with what it means to be black in America, and what\u2019s going on in our communities, and if we\u2019re going to get treated in the same way as everybody else. \u201cLaw enforcement doesn\u2019t necessarily take crime in poor black and brown communities seriously. You can see that in how these murders have gone unsolved. These two famous, talented people that emerged from really poor communities, they were like the best of us,\u201d Anderson adds. \u201cAnd they were gone, just like that [snaps fingers]. We didn\u2019t appreciate them while they were here and now we don\u2019t have any closure.\u201d While Slow Burn never reveals a culprit for the murders, the stories that it tells \u2013 the doomed heroes it portrays, the injustices it illuminates, and how they endure to this day \u2013 bring us closer to understanding this bloody chapter in hip-hop history.
