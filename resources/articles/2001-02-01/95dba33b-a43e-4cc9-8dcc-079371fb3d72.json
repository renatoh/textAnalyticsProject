He is working on a way of using solar power to desalinate water cheaply - potentially a vast boon to his native Afghanistan and a swathe of countries across Asia, the Middle East and Africa which suffer from water shortages but no lack of sunshine. But as he talks at his bench at South Bank University in London his eyes betray deep anxiety and sadness. There is sadness for the wreck of his country under a regime which has driven him out and destroyed the university he was proud of. But uppermost in his mind is whether his wife and their five children will be allowed to join him after more than two years apart. They were being interviewed in Pakistan that day by the British High Commission about a visa. \"My mind is not here,\" he apologises. The professor of engineering from Kabul is one of 27 people now being helped by the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara), a body which started in 1933 to help Jews and other victims of the Nazi purge of universities. The formation of what was then called the Academic Assistance Council was kick-started by a tumultuous meeting at the Albert Hall addressed by Albert Einstein. Today the centres of persecution have shifted via South Africa and Latin America to Iraq, Sudan, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Somalia, but the job of helping university teachers and researchers to pick themselves up after persecution and establish themselves in this country remains the same. The climate of hatred and distrust of asylum seekers is perhaps even worse than in the 1930s, although over the years Britain's reward for sheltering scholars has been out of all proportion to the tiny investment - 18 Nobel prizewinners, 71 fellows of the Royal Society, 50 fellows of the British Academy. The council campaigns on refugee issues and criticises what it sees as the worst excesses of government policy, such as the demeaning vouchers system. Its president, Sir Raymond Hoffenberg, who himself was a political exile from South Africa, has attacked the \"wholly unacceptable\" Immigration and Asylum Act and the current wave of bigotry at a time of unprecedented prosperity: \"It is difficult to imagine the implications for the UK and the world had Karl Popper or Max Perutz - two of the scholars we supported - been dealt with in the demeaning way envisaged by the current legislation: in isolation from other scholars, dumped far from cen tres of learning and forced to live on benefits provided by vouchers.\" But most of the council's work is practical: advice about the labyrinthine asylum and social security regulations, making contact with university departments where they might be welcome, small grants for fees and travel. Cara limits its scope to helping genuine academics but even for this small section of the overall refugee population it could do a lot more if it had more funds. Professor Lalzad's case is typical. A specialist in thermal engineering with a Russian masters degree, he taught in the department of mechanical engineering at Kabul University. He had five textbooks and more than 30 published articles to his credit and had held senior university positions. When the victorious Taliban closed the university, he worked for the Red Cross, in charge of distributing thousands of tonnes of food to 40,000 widows and disabled people. He was arrested, beaten with Kalashnikovs and thrown in prison on suspicion of giving information to anti-Taliban forces. The influence of the Red Cross got him released, but his life was in danger and he fled to Pakistan, where his wife and children were eventually able to follow. He arrived at Heathrow in December 1998, to be grilled for hours by immigration officials who believed he was Pakistani because his English was so good. (It was the medium of instruction in his department.) Lalzad concedes that Pakistanis do try to enter the UK by claiming to be Afghan refugees, and is sure he would have been deported had he not produced his Red Cross identity card. Then came a frustrating wait while his application for asylum was considered (it took 18 months) and he tried to get work. \"I felt ashamed sitting at home. It is a morally bad way of living for someone with education and knowledge not to work.\" Letters to universities produced no result, though he was encouraged by a short course at the University of North London, where he made contacts. He was at last given a break at South Bank by the director of engineering research, Professor Tassos Karayiannis. A grant from Cara is paying bench fees and for the purchase of a computer as Lalzad pursues a part-time PhD on his desalination research. At the moment he is doing mathematical modelling with the aim of building an experimental model of a solar-powered desalination plant. Desalination technology is well advanced in the oil-rich Middle East states, but across a wide zone of northern Asia, the Middle East and North Africa there is a pressing need for small, cheap plants. The goal is a gadget consisting of a small box and a condenser. \"I hope it will be a very low cost and efficient technique for desalinating water that can be used in poor developing countries, especially where they have a lot of solar energy.\" He hopes to be able to resume teaching at his new university. Meanwhile he waits for news of his family. The potential benefits of Professor Lalzad's research are obvious. John Akker, secretary of Cara, says his case is repeated many times over among the academics on their books. There is the Iraqi paediatrician, a consultant at Salahaddin University, forced to leave because of the help he gave to the Kurdish population. He has been given small grants for books and fees to enable him to pass the level of English that would allow him to practise in this country. Another Iraqi doctor is currently doing medical research at Manchester, while a bacteriologist identified only as Ms L is doing a PhD at Brighton University. Also receiving grants from the council are academics from Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda and Sierra Leon, and a Chinese economist who suffered long-running harassment and was dismissed from his university post after taking part in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. He is now doing an English course to enable him to pursue a masters. Until the council paid for travel expenses (\u00a3697 last year) he was walking ten miles to college. Yet he has not left all harassment behind: now it's racial. Akker is angered by current hysteria against asylum seekers, and worried by Home Secretary Jack Straw's proposals to process applications in neighbouring countries: \"These people are seen as scroungers living off the state, but they want to contribute here actively, and want to go back to their countries to change the things that brought them here in the first place.\" Cara: giving hope when hope has fled Albie Sachs, an academic who became a judge in South Africa's constitutional court, was twice helped by Cara's predecessor body, the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning - once when he fled the apartheid regime in 1966 and then again when he was nearly killed by a bomb in Mozambique. In a lecture he expressed his warm feelings for the body and its quiet unobtrusive work. \"It is not one of those bodies which takes out adverts in the bottom right hand of the front page of the Guardian,\" he told his audience in London in 1997. \"It was people helping people in need simply because they were in trouble, because they got into trouble because they were trying to do research in an intolerant society where persecution became the name of the game.\" This altruism did have enormous benefits to Britain in the contributions these outsiders made in teaching and research, and the effects did not stop there, he said. \"When the causes of persecution have been removed and we go back to our countries, we take so much of Britain with us. The positive and negative lessons which we learnt here. The things to avoid, the mistakes that are made, the good things that are done, and we help to rebuild our own countries and to develop democracy, science and learning and culture.\" Sachs listed a series of ministers in the first post-apartheid government in South Africa who had spent time in Britain, from Thabo Mbeki, Nelson Mandela's successor, who has an MA in economics from Sussex, to finance minister Gill Marcus, who set up a sandwich kiosk in Holborn, London, while in exile, and Frene Ginwala, speaker of the South African parliament. There might be spin-offs for Britain, he added, \"but what really matters is that some things are good in themselves, they do not need extra justification.\" The council is launching an appeal this spring.
