Of course he can", "bodyText": "In a curious quirk of timing, my son has chosen the middle of a hygiene apocalypse to start kissing things. Having desired his affection for so long, we find ourselves having to navigate his performative affection with a lot more care and discomfort than we expected. He kisses terribly, and with little discernment. Planting his mouth on surfaces we can clean is one thing, but random objects when we are out taking our exercise, or passing dogs is quite another. Now that we\u2019re barred from even rubbing elbows with pals, it\u2019s strange to think I ever found kissed greetings awkward. Prior to social distancing, my Irish friends and I would kiss each other hello, but we\u2019ve still inherited some of our ancestors\u2019 awkwardness. One time my sister Orla hugged our auntie Alice around her waist and she recoiled as if she\u2019d been stabbed. I don\u2019t know that my grandparents\u2019 generation ever kissed anyone. Weddings ended with handshakes. Newborn babies were given a pinch of snuff and a military salute. How much easier to have grown up in a culture of kissing hello, like the Mediterraneans. Not that some don\u2019t take it too far, of course. In Corsica they traditionally kiss five times on first meeting someone. Five times! You\u2019d be there all day. I\u2019ve never forgotten that fact,not least because it features in my favourite of all those jokes that need brackets in order to work. Q: Can you name a nationality that kisses five times? A: A Corsican! (Of course I can). It\u2019s clear my son hasn\u2019t yet worked out the function of kissing, but then neither have I. This week, perhaps nostalgic for basic affection, I found myself Googling \u2018history of kissing\u2019 and discovered it\u2019s not an innate human instinct at all. Dr Vaughn Bryant of Texas A&amp;M University \u2013 pleasingly referred to as \u2018an anthropologist who specialises in the history of the kiss\u2019 \u2013 says it\u2019s entirely learned. According to the world\u2019s premier smooch boffin, the habit was first mentioned only 3,500 years ago, and has simply spread, virus-like, since then. The idea that kissing is a learned behaviour seems odd until you watch someone learn it. Then it seems bewildering that we ever manage it at all. The difference between platonic and romantic kissing is an early hurdle, since some instinct for symmetry means my little Lothario always aims for my mouth until I redirect him to my cheek. There, his lips are as airtight as Dr Bryant\u2019s credentials for presenting a slinky Saturday night slot on Heart FM. I hope his enthusiasm prevails, undimmed by the temporary cessation of affection in which we all find ourselves. At least he has time to hone his skills until our friends and family meet lips-first once again. Can I hold on until then? A Corsican.
