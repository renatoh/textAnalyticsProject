The only constant has been working out what to eat", "bodyText": "\u201cSeventy-two baps, Connie \u2013 you slice, I\u2019ll spread,\u201d said Victoria Wood, denoting the arch stoicism of a British woman facing the enormity of death. It\u2019s a line I\u2019ve loved nearly all my life, not least because it reminds me of big ladies in smock dresses at Dent family funerals in the 1980s. Up at dawn to make a tipsy cake, then turn two pounds of chicken breast \u201ccoronation\u201d via the application of curry powder and jam, and wave off the corpse. I\u2019d like to say that \u201cConnie slicing baps\u201d has been my personality throughout lockdown thus far, but that\u2019s not the full story. Perhaps, like me, your Covid-19 crisis persona shifts through several gears each and every hour, from calm to terrified to brave to depressed to jolly, via gallows humour and so on. The only constant has been working out what to eat at a time when many ingredients we once took for granted are scarce. In my most Connie moments, I\u2019m frankly far too busy for Covid-19. Cook, cook, cook. Bleach this, sterilise that. I\u2019ve got the Magimix out for the first time in years, trying to do a rudimentary banana bread with strong flour, having not found, during this war, the correct GI to have sex with in order to procure a 1kg bag of self-raising. The judder of the blades pulverising sweetly decaying bananas drowns out morbid thoughts about my friends potentially dying in the vast Whittington Hospital down the road. It also nulls the thoughts of my other half\u2019s much-loved rabbi dying suddenly last weekend, after appearing unwell in shul and then quickly gone, or my brother\u2019s friend with Parkinson\u2019s dying in intensive care. The silver lining to this \u2013 glimmering ever so weakly \u2013 is that I have not wasted those decaying bananas. Oh no. Bananas ticked off my list. For my next trick I will be making a cheering set of scones using the wrong flour and a box of Trex cooking fat that predates Siobh\u00e1n\u2019s first time in the Sugababes. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d my friends ask each other constantly on WhatsApp, checking in, our friendship meaning more than it ever has before. In my case, it depends on when you ask me. Yesterday, I was in my Covid-19 mode where I would be played by Nicola Walker: subdued, bubblingly furious, underslept with eyes that have seen so much, breakfasting and lunching on Maxwell House sachets stolen from hotel rooms and Nutella out of the jar with a dessert spoon, all while trying to weigh up what will kill one of my family members first: the lack of chemo or the Covid-19 they catch while having it? This decision feels above my pay grade. Where can I buy a hazmat suit online? \u201cCan we drive them to the front door wrapped in clingfilm, and I\u2019ll sit in the boot?\u201d I suggest to my brother at one point. It felt, in that moment, a reasonable question. Afterwards, I had freezer-bread toast and cracked open my emergency raspberry jam. My favourite lockdown persona, which I save especially for supermarkets, is Tina Turner as Aunty Entity in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Sure, this dystopian world is upon us, but I will survive. I\u2019ll be pivotal in Earth\u2019s rebuilding, as well as glamorous and Amazonian. Asda is my Bartertown; if I move before dawn, under cover of darkness, I can stock up on couscous and even hand sanitiser. My most nauseating lockdown hours, meanwhile, are the ones I spend channelling Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop newsletter, because, like, if you think about it, maybe Covid-19 is, like, a chance to totally emotionally recentre and focus on nourishment and healing. During this time, I listen to my Tara Brach \u201cradical acceptance\u201d guided meditations while shredding cauliflower leaves before sauteeing them with shallot and carrot, adding a handful of barley and simmering in low-sodium Marigold vegetable bouillon. Immunity is so important. \u201cJesus Christ, it\u2019s a good job you\u2019re self-isolating alone,\u201d one friend says. \u201cMaybe sleep with a window ajar.\u201d Because of my other half\u2019s high-risk job, we are apart for the foreseeable, but then many people all over the world right now are in peculiar situations. Homes split, mealtimes fractured. Alone, apart, but also, at the same time, together. On last night\u2019s Zoom chat, an anniversary, he was sitting in his pants after work, eating some godforsaken cut of an animal he\u2019d found in his freezer, drinking a beer and listening to the awful, trumpet-heavy jazz that he likes and that I loathe because it makes me feel as if I\u2019m being chased by bees. He was planning on watching a Jason Statham movie. \u201cAre you missing me?\u201d I asked. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied, \u201cI am having a terrible time.\u201d \u201cThis could go on for months,\u201d I said. \u201cI know,\u201d he said, a small flicker of bliss dancing about his lips. We\u2019re all in a dire situation. But look out for those silver linings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
