Thank you for your emails, and here\u2019s Sean Ingle\u2019s fight report: Joshua is asked about arranging a fight with the other big names in the heavyweight boxing: \u201cWhen Wilder and Fury and Ortiz are really, really ready they\u2019ll make the call ... If you want to create history they know where we are.\u201d He seems more keen on a third fight with Ruiz though. Our official report is up and running now: Joshua says this fight was his second favourite in his career. His victory over Klitschko was his No1 due to his respect for his opponent. Joshua makes a point of thanking the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and members of the royalty after his victory, which will not go down well with those who see this fight as little more than an exercise in sportswashing. Ruiz grabs the mic and says: \u201cWho wants to see a third fight?\u201d Joshua replies: \u201cIf you\u2019ve heard, you\u2019ll see a third.\u201d I take that as a confirmation they\u2019ll go again. Ruiz admits he was too heavy for the fight. \u201cI was chasing him too much, hesitating too much,\u201d he says. Joshua speaks: First of all, I want to thank God. I want to say, man, the first time was so nice, I had to do it twice. A man like me don\u2019t make no excuses, I\u2019m used to knocking out guys. I said to myself I was going to correct myself. The sweet science of this sport is hitting and not getting caught. I\u2019m hungry and I\u2019m humble. Thank you to Andrew Ruiz and his family. What a disciplined performance from Joshua, who kept his opponent at distance and was barely troubled by Ruiz. He shed 11lbs for the fight, looking for agility and speed over power. And it was that lightness on his feet that won the day. Joshua wins by unanimous decision! The judges had it 118-110, 118-110 and 119-109. The two men hug in the centre of the ring, it\u2019s clear they have tremendous respect for each other as Joshua chats to Ruiz for 30 seconds or so. From my viewpoint, Joshua just needs to survive this round. Ruiz gets in close and lands a few blows to Joshua\u2019s body but Joshua counters seconds later with a big, big right. But he knows he doesn\u2019t need the KO and the Briton dances away. Ruiz smiles to himself as he swings away in the final few seconds but they don\u2019t threaten Joshua. He is an all probability, the champion again. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 118-110 Ruiz) Joshua snaps another jab into Ruiz, if he regains the title that jab will be a huge part of his victory. He\u2019s held off his dangerous, shorter opponent so well all night. Ruiz, who is behind on points, has done very little in these last few rounds to go for a finish. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 108-101 Ruiz) There\u2019s been plenty of talk about Ruiz\u2019s conditioning but he looks far from punched out after 10 grueling rounds. That said, Joshua looks the more sprightly of the two. A pretty cagey round, with neither man opening themselves up - possibly saving their best for the final two. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 98-92 Ruiz) How does Joshua react after being shaken for the first time? Will he retain his discipline? He probably has this fight if he can continue to keep his man at distance. Joshua lands two good blows and dances out again before Ruiz can counter. He\u2019s learned lessons from the first fight. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 88-83 Ruiz) A few more rounds of this and Ruiz will need a KO to retain his title. It\u2019s been clever, disciplined boxing from Joshua so far. No mean feat, when you\u2019re thirsting for revenge and there\u2019s the nagging desire to go in and finish the fight quickly. Ruiz looks frustrated and finally does some damage, landing a blow on the top of Joshua\u2019s head. That\u2019s the most damage he\u2019s done to his opponent tonight. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 9-10 Ruiz (Joshua 78-74 Ruiz) Compubox says that 93% of the fight has been fought at distance, a clear advantage to the taller Joshua. I can barely remember a clinch so far. Joshua gets in a few hooks and for a moment breaks from the plan and darts in to do damage from close range. But he springs back before Ruiz can do damage. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 69-64 Ruiz) Ruiz predicted that he\u2019d let Joshua dance and jab for the first rounds before going in and causing damage, but the Briton hasn\u2019t let him inside all fight ... so far. Joshua gets in close and delivers a blow to Ruiz\u2019s body. It does damage but Ruiz will have no problem with the challenger getting in where he can do damage to him. Ruiz looks slow, and who knows how that extra 15lbs he\u2019s put on since June will tell as the fight wears on. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 59-55 Ruiz) That cut has reopened above Ruiz\u2019s left eye. Joshua still in control but he\u2019s not going into Ruiz\u2019s body, and is maybe a little one-dimensional. He smiles to himself as he lands a couple of hard jabs to Ruiz\u2019s head. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 49-46 Ruiz) Joshua is in control, but Ruiz \u2013 at 280lbs \u2013 is so dangerous if he gets a big blow in, the challenger can\u2019t afford to let his concentration slip. Joshua has consistently attacked Ruiz at the end of these rounds, and he does so against in the fourth. But Ruiz gets a punch in in the clinch and rocks Joshua for the first time. I\u2019m giving that round to Ruiz, just. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 9-10 Ruiz (Joshua 39-37 Ruiz) Ruiz has said he expects Joshua to go for it in the opening rounds, so I wouldn\u2019t take too much from the Briton edging the first two. \u201cI think he will box around nicely for four or five rounds until I take the pressure to him, start hitting his body and mixing it up,\u201d said Ruiz this week. The stats say, Joshua has landed 18 punches to Ruiz\u2019s nine. Joshua looks almost skinny and he\u2019s able to leap back from Ruiz\u2019s jabs. Joshua gets a hook to Ruiz\u2019s body at the end of the round. Not as emphatic from the Briton, but he edged that round. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 30-27 Ruiz) The vaseline goes on Ruiz\u2019s cut. He doesn\u2019t look too worried, but even though Joshua won that first round, the Briton was a lot more cautious than he was in the first fight when his aggression got him in trouble. Two nice jabs from Ruiz, his best shots of the fight. Joshua focusing on that area with the cut and it\u2019s reopened early in the round. And then a right from Joshua from close range, but Joshua is bleeding now too. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 20-18 Ruiz) Ruiz is in gold trunks and Joshua in white. The crowd has warmed up a little. As predicted Joshua is keeping his opponent at a distance, controlling the centre of the ring. Joshua gets in the first significant blow of the fight - a right to Ruiz\u2019s temple. There\u2019s already blood above Ruiz\u2019s left eye. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 10-9 Ruiz) Ruiz is giving away four inches in height and eight inches in reach to Joshua (although admittedly he is around 50lbs heavier) but that doesn\u2019t bother him. In fact, he\u2019s been fighting taller men his entire career, and is ready to use the height difference against his opponent, getting inside Joshua and causing damage close up. \u201cThat is exactly what we have been training on,\u201d said Ruiz earlier this week. \u201cBeing small, being more slick, applying pressure, throwing combinations and being first to the punch. I know he is going to try to box me around, that is why he lost some weight, he will try to keep me away with the jab. But that\u2019s what we have been practising for.\u201d I have to say the crowd is pretty flat - nowhere near the bear pit atmosphere you get at a usual title fight. Blame the lack of beer. We get three anthems for the price of two! After the British and US ones, we get a special rendition of the Mexican anthem, in tribute to Ruiz\u2019s Mexican roots. Here\u2019s a look at how Ruiz and Joshua match up ahead of tonight\u2019s main event. Ruiz tipped the scales at 283lbs at the weigh-in, 15lbs more than in their first encounter in June. Only Russia\u2019s Nikolai Valuev (who was seven feet tall) has ever weighed more for a world heavyweight title fight. Joshua came in at 237lbs, 10lbs down from six months ago and his lightest weight in more than five years. Ruiz comes in with a golden robe with a nice fur trim. Maybe not ideal wear for the desert, but it\u2019s been raining so maybe he knew something we didn\u2019t. Joshua is first out as the challenger in a white robe. No entourage for the Briton - he strolls in on his own like it\u2019s his day off. Maybe an early sign to the audience that tonight is about the fight, and not the sideshow - a criticism levelled at him after the last fight. The elephant in the room, of course, is the setting of tonight\u2019s event. Tonight\u2019s card is taking place amid mounting criticism from Amnesty International that taking around $80m from a kingdom that has an \u201cabysmal\u201d human rights record, including jailing and executing opponents, is morally bankrupt. (And that\u2019s putting aside the four fighters on the card with a history of testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs.) Felix Jakens, Amnesty International UK\u2019s head of campaigns, made his organisation\u2019s feelings on the fight - and its venue \u2013 clear. \u201cThe fight is pure sportswashing and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to challenge the Saudi propaganda machine and its increased use of sport to gloss over its abysmal human rights record,\u201d he said. Joshua, who\u2019s absorbed a fair share of criticism for saying Saudi Arabia is \u201ctrying to do a good job politically\u201d and that everyone in the country seems to be having a good time, has dismissed suggestions that his legacy as a role model will be tarnished for his role in the affair. \u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cI just came here for the boxing opportunity. I look around and everyone seems pretty happy and chilled. I\u2019ve not seen anyone in a negative light out here, everyone seems to be having a good time.\u201d Joshua also appeared to not know what Amnesty International was when told the human rights organisation wanted him to research and speak out about problems in the country. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Joshua replied in an interview with the BBC. \u201cI haven\u2019t known much about Amnesty because I\u2019ve spent most of my time in Finchley just training. But as an individual I try to bring positivity and light everywhere I go. I\u2019m just seeing it from my eyes alone but for sure the country in itself is trying to do a good job politically. \u201cFor the sporting side of things, I just feel I\u2019ve got a fight to focus on. For the future maybe I can bear a different kind of flag but at the minute it\u2019s just the world championship flag I\u2019m trying to bear.\u201d Joshua is expected to earn upward $50m for Saturday\u2019s rematch in Saudi Arabia, compared to around $9m for his opponent. However Joshua\u2019s promoter Eddie Hearn has insisted money is secondary to reclaiming his belts. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he has wanted it so bad before,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cWhen he lost he wasn\u2019t in a great place for weeks after. But he\u2019s really got his head screwed on. It\u2019s \u2018I\u2019ve got to win this fight\u2019 not just \u2018It\u2019s a lot of money and I\u2019ve got to take it\u2019.\u201d. Andy Ruiz is interviewed in the dressing room. \u201cI\u2019m feeling good, feeling ready, we\u2019re going to do the same thing as we did in June. The rain has started again but Ruiz is not worried. \u201cI\u2019m alright as long as we stick to the gameplan, the rain the weather doesn\u2019t really matter He\u2019s asked about Joshua\u2019s tactics: \u201cHe\u2019s going to try to box me around, if he tries to headhunt that will go in my favour.\u201d Our first prediction of the evening, from Kevin Kukhta. \u201cBeing ten pounds lighter than previously shows his strategy, as its likely he\u2019s not going to stand and trade with Ruiz, instead circling and jabbing his head off with that reach until Ruiz is gassed, then going in for the kill. AJ lost because he was overconfident, but with this humility and strategy, he\u2019ll probably win. Ruiz is still incredibly dangerous.\u201d Pacheco has knocked out Saidi in the first round of their fight, and the Tanzanian is still receiving medical attention but should be OK. He went down hard though. The 18-year-old Diego Pacheco, who has won all seven of his pro fights, is the one to watch in our penultimate fight of the evening. He\u2019s very tall for a super middleweight \u2013 6ft 4in \u2013 and will surely move up the weight classes as he ages and bulks up. Selemani Saidi of Tanzania is his opponent. Michael Hunter landed bigger blows \u2013 particularly in the later rounds \u2013 in this fight but Povetkin may have won more rounds. Let\u2019s see how the judges scores it. And it\u2019s ... a split draw. Hunter landed more shots, but Povetkin edged the power punches. So, we have one more fight on the undercard before the main events. They had initially said Ruiz and Joshua would be making their ringwalks in the next 10 minutes, but that will obviously be delayed for another 45 minutes or so. They think that around 4,000 British fans have travelled to Saudi Arabia to support Joshua, and the DAZN commentators make a reasonable point: will the absence of alcohol in the arena make a difference to the atmosphere. There\u2019s a decent noise at the moment as Hunter rocks Povetkin in the 11th \u2013 his best round of the fight so far. A little update on the evening\u2019s schedule. Diego Pacheco (USA) v Selemani Saidi (Tanzania) has been added to the card. It\u2019s over six rounds, but means Joshua and Ruiz won\u2019t be making their ringwalks for another 90 minutes or so. Weather update: the rain has stopped completely now, so any fears the fight would be postponed are pretty much over. Having said that, a mysterious smoke floats across the ring - maybe some escaped dry ice? - as Hunter and Povetkin trade big blows at the end of the seventh. Povetkin has come back into this fight and crashes Hunter into the ropes with two big lefts. We\u2019re about to enter the sixth, and the Russian is edging it. According to my emails so far - admittedly seven people may not be a statistically significant sample \u2013 the public think Joshua has got tonight\u2019s fight wrapped up. DAZN gives us a shot of Andy Ruiz\u2019s cousin\u2019s house, where the family have gathered to watch the fight. For a little look at Ruiz\u2019s background and rise to the heavyweight championship, feel free to read Bryan Graham\u2019s missive from Imperial, California, his hometown. The camera cuts to Joshua being taped up in the dressing room, looking calm and serious. We then get a shot of Ruiz, already taped up, who looks pretty relaxed, loosening up with a few swings of those huge arms. Canelo Alvarez has arrived, and gets to enjoy a night out at the fights with the added bonus of not getting punched in the face. Meanwhile, Hunter has started off strong against Povetkin, landing a flurry of blows on his opponent, who looks shaken. A quick betting update [LEGAL NOTE: The Guardian does not encourage gambling]. The bookies have Joshua as the favourite at 4-9, with the champion Ruiz at 2-1 and the draw at 28-1. Ruiz\u2019s dad, Andy Sr, may like those odds - he won $50,000 betting on his son in the first fight, although the odds were a little longer for that one. Michael Hunter enters the ring for the final undercard dressed as The Predator. His nickname isn\u2019t even The Predator - it\u2019s The Bounty. Although coming in as a coconut-themed chocolate bar may not be that intimidating. Dillian Whyte\u2019s fight against Mariusz Wach is over. The Englishman was pushed all the way by his 6ft 8in Polish opponent, who took him to 10 rounds. Whyte takes it by unanimous decision, and we have one more fight \u2013 the WBA heavyweight eliminator between Alexander Povetkin (Russia) and Michael Hunter (USA) before \u2013 before the main event. It\u2019s been a good week for the Whyte family after Dillian\u2019s brother, Dean, tackled a troublesome passenger on the flight over. Ruiz or Joshua? Joshua or Ruiz? Here\u2019s a look at how 14 fighters see tonight\u2019s main event. Send along your predictions to our Tom Lutz, who will be taking over from here, via email or Twitter at @tom_lutz. Deontay Wilder (WBC heavyweight champion): Ruiz \u201cI see Ruiz coming back in, doing the exact same thing he did the first time. In rematches, when you get two guys in there sharing each other\u2019s energy, you sort of know what they\u2019re going to do. Although you can go back into the gym, strategize and get new ideas, like Mike Tyson said: \u2018Everyone has a plan until they get hit.\u2019 And sometimes when you get hit, you go back to what you know. Ruiz still has nothing to lose. The pressure is still on Joshua to show it\u2019s a fluke, to show it was a bad night in the office. I\u2019m not saying Joshua can\u2019t win. He can put it together and get the victory, but my pick is Ruiz.\u201d Dominic Breazeale (world heavyweight title challenger): Joshua by TKO 10 \u201cAnthony Joshua wins. I believe that Joshua learns from his mistakes and boxes the first three rounds until he sees an opening. In the fourth round Joshua will take advantage of it. The seventh round is the most exciting round of the fight with both fighters being knocked down. In the end, however, I see Joshua coming out on top via 10th-round TKO, referee\u2019s stoppage.\u201d Adam Kownacki (undefeated heavyweight contender): Ruiz by KO 9 \u201cI think the Andy Ruiz-Anthony Joshua fight is too close to call. Both fighters are very well prepared and it\u2019s the heavyweight division where one punch could end everything. I feel that the winner will be who wants it more. Does Andy want to be know as a heavyweight champ and to prove that the first fight was not just won by luck? Or will Anthony do everything to get his title back? I\u2019m not convinced Anthony wants the title back. I have Andy winning again.\u201d Luis Ortiz (two-time world heavyweight title challenger): Joshua on points \u201cIn my heart, I truly want for Andy Ruiz to pull off another victory over Anthony Joshua once again. But I believe that Joshua has learned a valuable lesson from losing the first fight. So I believe that Joshua will stay at a distance and that he will outbox Ruiz on the way to winning a decision.\u201d Gerald Washington (world heavyweight title challenger): Ruiz \u201cI am in camp with Andy Ruiz, and I\u2019m witnessing, first-hand, that everything I have heard about his fast hands and his skills is true. Anthony Joshua is a great fighter and he was a tremendous champion, but Andy beat him the first time and I believe that he has the confidence to do it again.\u201d Joseph Parker (former WBO heavyweight champion): Joshua \u201cNot too sure but if I had to pick someone I think AJ will win if he uses his reach and height and moves around. Andy is one damn tough guy though and his pressure and counterpunching is spot-on.\u201d Claressa Shields (undisputed middleweight champion): Joshua by late-rounds KO \u201cI have AJ winning the rematch. Why? Because that loss forced him to change up many things. He is slimmer now, using angles and knows what he is up against. I believe Ruiz will come with the smoke he had in the first fight but people forget that Joshua dropped Ruiz first! So I see a late KO by Anthony Joshua if he sticks a hard fast jab in Ruiz\u2019s face and get the combinations going.\u201d Amanda Serrano (seven-division world champion): Ruiz by mid-to-late rounds TKO \u201cI think that Ruiz will win again. I think mentally he has the edge and Anthony, although a good fighters, doesn\u2019t look real confident. I predict Ruiz stops him in the mid-to-late rounds.\u201d Demetrius Andrade (WBA middleweight champion): Undecided \u201cHistory shows that the person who won the first time is going to win the next time. If Ruiz gets inside and uses his faster hands then it\u2019s probably going to go the same way. But Joshua is a great fighter and if he adjusts and uses his reach to keep Ruiz on the outside then Joshua can pull of the win and get his belts back. Either way, I expect a great fight and may the best man win.\u201d Jaime Mungu\u00eda (WBO light middleweight champion): Ruiz \u201cI think that Andy Ruiz will come stronger. He has more confidence in himself. Now the pressure is on Joshua\u2019s side. Sincerely, I feel that Andy Ruiz will walk away with his hand raised.\u201d Rom\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez (four-division world champion): Ruiz by KO \u201cI believe that Ruiz has less pressure to win this time. Not much about his mindset has changed since winning the first fight and entering the rematch, I think that Joshua\u2019s mindset is insecure. There are so many people trying to tell him what he should do in order to beat Ruiz.\u201d Tevin Farmer (IBF super featherweight champion): Joshua by KO \u201cI honestly think it\u2019s a 50-50 fight but Joshua\u2019s going to knock him out. I don\u2019t know what round but he\u2019s going to knock Ruiz out.\u201d Carl Frampton (former two-division world champion): Joshua on points \u201cI go with Joshua, but someone is getting knocked out. Mentally, Joshua needs to be strong to regain the titles.\u201d Andy Lee (former WBO middleweight champion): Undecided \u201cThe only thing I am certain of is that I don\u2019t know who is going to win. It\u2019s the hardest fight I can remember in a long time. There\u2019s ways that both men can win obviously. It\u2019s about their mentality now. Has it damaged Joshua? Will Ruiz be as hungry now? He has the money, the fame and the belts now. I can see Joshua boxing disciplined and winning on points, or Ruiz breaking him down again. A lot might depend on the night and who can handle the occasion. But I think the first round is most important. Whoever wins the first round sets the tone.\u201d The big news of the last 24 hours, no pun intended, centers on Andy Ruiz\u2019s weight. The champion tipped the scales at 283lbs at yesterday\u2019s weigh-in, 15lbs more than June\u2019s first installment, prompting widespread criticism. In perhaps an ominous historical parallel, that\u2019s the same weight gain Buster Douglas made between his famous upset of Mike Tyson (231lbs) and his doomed first title defense against Evander Holyfield (246lbs). But Ruiz insisted his true weight is far lower, telling the Athletic he would have come in closer to 270lbs if the weigh-in had been held earlier in the day. \u201cThey made us wait until 4:30, almost 5pm here,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cI already had ate breakfast, lunch and dinner, I had on a sombrero and all my clothes. A lot of people are saying that I came overweight or this and that but we had to wait so long. I probably put on 10 pounds just eating and drinking normally today. I would\u2019ve been at like 268 without all that stuff and haven\u2019t had eaten. If we weighed in at 11am, I definitely would have been less.\u201d Ruiz\u2019s trainer, Manny Robles, chalked up the eye-popping figure to the conversion rate (?) and his fighter\u2019s decision to take the scale fully clothes. \u201cHe is well prepared, like always,\u201d Robles told ESPN Deportes. \u201cIt was because of the conversion from kilos to pounds, you also have to bear in mind the increase with his clothes.\u201d The rain is coming down in sheets outside (and inside) the open-air arena built for tonight\u2019s event. Meanwhile, Croatian prospect Filip Hrgovic has stopped Eric Molina in the third round of their scheduled 12-round scrap, spared from the deluge by the small canopy hanging over the ring. The BBC\u2019s Dan Roan reports that organizers have said there\u2019s no prospect of delay or cancellation despite the watery conditions, but the problems are mounting as the card moves forward. A few of the TV broadcasters on press row have enlisted assistants to shield them from the rain by holding umbrellas over their set-ups, but the umbrellas are obstructing the sightlines of several spectators in the high-rent district, who are understandably kicking off over it. Here\u2019s a look at tonight\u2019s bout sheet. Also, a reminder that Saudi Arabia has world\u2019s third lowest rainfall with 59mm annually, according to the Press Association\u2019s Mark Staniforth. Ruiz and Joshua are expected to make their entrances at a quarter to midnight local time or a little over three hours from now.

We\u2019re ringside at the purpose-built Diriyah Arena on the north-west outskirts of the Saudi capital for what\u2019s surely the most controversial world heavyweight title fight in more than 40 years. Six months after Ruiz turned boxing\u2019s bellwether division on its ear with a seismic upset of the then-unbeaten Joshua at Madison Square Garden, they\u2019re running it back in the middle of the desert \u2013 where Joshua will attempt to become only fourth deposed heavyweight champion to win an immediate rematch after Floyd Patterson (against Ingemar Johansson in 1960), Muhammad Ali (against Leon Spinks in 1978) and Lennox Lewis (against Hasim Rahman in 2001). The story of the moment is the oppressive rainfall positively lashing down on the 15,000-seat arena in the middle of the Arabian Desert because of course. Pockets of spectators wearing plastic ponchos are scattered through the mostly empty stands as with many more taking shelter in the tight concourses as England\u2019s Tom Little is blasted out in two at the hands of Azerbaijan\u2019s Mahammadrasul Majidov in the night\u2019s first pay-per-view fight. Peak Britain, really. We\u2019ll be back with tonight\u2019s schedule, and perhaps a wee look at the forecast, after seeking cover ourselves. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s Sean Ingle\u2019s lookahead to tonight\u2019s main event."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
