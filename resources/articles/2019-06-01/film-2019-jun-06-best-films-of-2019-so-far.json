What we said: \u201cA reminder that the idea of royalty as polite and picturesquely sentimental is something that came in with Queen Victoria: The Favourite is more punk than that. It\u2019s a rousingly nasty, bleary, hungover punchup.\u201d Read the full review An Impossible Love A daughter\u2019s life is shaped by her father\u2019s arrogance and her mother\u2019s humility in Catherine Corsini\u2019s delicate drama. What we said: \u201cA mother-daughter story with the erotic intensity of a love story and the pathos of a coming-of-ager \u2013 though darker, messier and more unresolved than is traditional.\u201d Read the full review Colette Keira Knightley and Dominic West have a riot in this gender-bending and surprisingly funny story of the author and the husband who tried to steal her glory \u2013 as well as her girlfriend. What we said: \u201cA Star Is Born for the belle \u00e9poque: an early-years biopic of French literary phenomenon Colette that is invigorating, mercenary and sexy.\u201d Read the full review Monsters and Men Reinaldo Marcus Green\u2019s tough drama follows the fortunes of three young African American men who find their loyalties divided and their futures in peril. What we said: \u201cThere is humanity and complexity in this welcome movie, as well as muscular power and unreconciled anger.\u201d Read the full review Hale County This Morning, This Evening Executive-produced by Laura Poitras, this documentary by RaMell Ross is a revelatory study of African American lives. What we said: \u201cIt feels as if Ross has created a sustained kind of euphoria, a 76-minute epiphany of love for his community.\u201d Read the full review Destroyer Nicole Kidman alters her appearance \u2013 and leaves her comfort zone \u2013 considerably for this gritty, twisty crime drama about an LA detective brutalised by an undercover mission. What we said: \u201cKidman\u2019s performance is superb: smart, committed, utterly absorbing. There is a horribly compelling contrast between Erin\u2019s present state and her fresh-faced appearance in flashback. Kidman brings something particularly disquieting to the role, turning into a bleached, gaunt mask with eye sockets raw and red, possibly from long-dried tears.\u201d Read the full review Vice Adam McKay follows The Big Short with a larky quasi-biopic of former VP Dick Cheney strewn with red herrings, ripe cameos and risky politics. What we said: \u201cA big, enjoyable, intelligent central performance in which Christian Bale has the sense to do more with less.\u201d Read the full review Burning Lee Chang-dong\u2019s Cannes hit is a superbly shot mystery thriller about obsessive love, taken from a short story by Haruki Murakami. What we said: \u201cA psychological drama set in the modern consumerist Korea of the callous Gangnam-style rich and poor young people who often go invisibly to ground, pursued by credit-card debt.\u201d Read the full review Can You Ever Forgive Me? Melissa McCarthy and Richard E Grant excel as a belligerent literary memorabilia forger and her waspish sidekick in this brilliant black comedy. What we said: \u201cThere is something very authentic in some of this film\u2019s incidental details. Lee grabs her TV, turns it on so it\u2019s showing fuzzy white noise and then flips it on its back so she can use it as a lightbox to trace No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s signature on one of her phoney typewritten screeds. That has the clumsy absurdity of real life.\u201d Read the full review All Is True Kenneth Branagh is a late-stage Shakespeare and Judi Dench his long-suffering wife in Ben Elton\u2019s witty, melancholic study of regret and homecoming. What we said: \u201cI liked the long scenes of winter drear, as William and Anne huddle together in a corner of a dark room, flickeringly lit by firelight like a cave.\u201d Read the full review Am\u00e9rica A 93-year-old Mexican woman is the startled star of this irresistible documentary about her relationship with three doting grandsons. What we said: \u201cThe film has real artistry in the way it is put together. It has the potency of a sympathetically fabricated kind of realist fiction, a guided-reality effect that is completely absorbing. The coda leaves you with an irresistibly sweet sadness.\u201d Read the full review If Beale Street Could Talk Barry Jenkins\u2019s follow-up to Moonlight is a lush and highly emotional adaptation of the James Baldwin novel about childhood love and police brutality in 1970s New York. What we said: \u201cHere is a film almost woozy with its own beauty and dignity, a film going transcendently high in the face of a racist world going low. It is a tribute of quiet passion extended to those lives fractured by injustice, and seems to serenely offer up their hard-won heroism to ward off bigotry\u2019s corrosive evil.\u201d Read the full review The Lego Movie 2 The sequel to the wildly acclaimed first Lego film offers a sophisticated and nuanced adventure for the micro heroes. What we said: \u201cThere\u2019s hilarious voice-work artistry, ceaselessly inventive pop-culture riffs, eyeball-popping graphics and a 107-minute nonstop gag-storm of a screenplay from Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.\u201d Read the full review Capernaum Nadine Labaki\u2019s powerful drama tell the story of a Beirut child who sues his parents for giving birth to him then ends up on the street caring for a stranger\u2019s baby. What we said: \u201cThere is passion and compassion here, and Labaki\u2019s film brings home what poverty and desperation mean, and what love and humanity mean.\u201d Read the full review Hannah Charlotte Rampling brings an intelligent intensity to the role of a woman whose ageing husband has been jailed in this near-wordless drama. What we said: \u201cThe film itself has what you could call Resting Charlotte Rampling Face: austerely intelligent, unsmilingly beautiful, intimidating, cold in a way that speaks of sadness protectively walled up in dignity and courtesy. It is an expression that could too easily be mistaken for simple contempt or self-disgust.\u201d Read the full review Border Ali Abbasi\u2019s dark drama focuses on transgression and taboo as two troubled people living on the edge of society develop a strange friendship. What we said: \u201cIt\u2019s a satirical reflection on the minority experience, perhaps also inspired by the director\u2019s own feelings about being an Iranian who has studied and now lives and works in Denmark.\u201d Read the full review Everybody Knows Iranian director Asghar Farhadi casts husband-and-wife Javier Bardem and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz as a couple picking at an unhealed wound. What we said: \u201cThis is a movie about a devastating external blow to a family, delivered with almost supernatural accuracy, a blow that exposes all sorts of cracks and weaknesses and fault-lines, and does so with such pitiless efficiency that it is almost as if these secrets and lies are a kind of sin, which has called forth an inevitable punishment. It is an idea to which Farhadi has been drawn before: the unburied secret, the unhealed wound, the imminent return of the repressed.\u201d Read the full review The Kindergarten Teacher Maggie Gyllenhaal excels as a teacher and wannabe poet who exploits a child prodigy in this gripping psychological drama. What we said: \u201cIt is a story of horribly intimate transgression, and also a deadpan provocation, somewhere between realism and fantasy satire. It reminded me of Jonathan Glazer\u2019s 2004 drama Birth, which found a similar way to test audience expectations of permissible behaviour.\u201d Read the full review Girl Victor Polster is outstanding as a 15-year-old trans girl auditioning for ballet school in Lukas Dhont\u2019s intense, emotional drama. What we said: \u201cOpinions may divide about the climax of the film, whether it creates an unnecessarily problematised narrative, despite the note of realist optimism on which it finishes. The sheer sustained intensity of the drama and performances carry it through.\u201d Read the full review Us Jordan Peele\u2019s follow-up to Get Out is a superb doppelganger chiller that skewers the American dream. What we said: \u201cThough this doesn\u2019t quite have the same lethal narrative discipline of Peele\u2019s debut masterpiece Get Out, with its drum-tight clarity and control, what it certainly does have is a magnificent lead performance from Nyong\u2019o, who brings to it a basilisk stare of horror.\u201d Read the full review Pet Sematary Previously filmed in 1989, this remake of the creepy Stephen King novel with Jason Clarke and John Lithgow is an impressively nasty scare story. What we said: \u201cThe story keeps efficiently turning the screw, and the misspelling itself has a power of its own. It conveys an oppressive state of wrongness: it is the non-cemetery where the dead refuse to accept their status. The final image is an exhilaratingly nauseous lurch.\u201d Read the full review Happy As Lazzaro Alice Rohrwacher\u2019s enigmatic drama is an unsettling and moving satire about the unquestioning toil of peasants\u2019 lives. What we said: \u201cHappy As Lazzaro is a weightless enigma, an unfathomable promise of happiness, gently tugging you upwards, like a balloon on the end of a string.\u201d Read the full review The Sisters Brothers Jacques Audiard\u2019s English-language debut is an all-American delight, starring Joaquin Phoenix and John C Reilly perfect as sad, squabbling siblings. What we said: \u201cThis is a portrait of male sadness and claustrophobic and empty male ambition: the title is not merely jokey; these are men without women who have become emotionally stagnant and terribly lonely.\u201d Read the full review Dragged Across Concrete Mel Gibson and Vince Vaughn are a pair of out-of-control cops careering towards in oblivion in S Craig Zahler\u2019s often brilliant crime flick. What we said: \u201cDragged Across Concrete doesn\u2019t drag. This is a long film, but there is something so horribly compelling about its unhurried slouch towards the precipice.\u201d Read the full review Avengers: Endgame The climactic movie in the Avengers series is an irresistible blend of action and comedy, guaranteeing a sugar rush of delirious enjoyment. What we said: \u201cAvengers: Endgame is entirely preposterous and, yes, the central plot device here does not deliver the shock of the new. But the sheer enjoyment and fun, the pure exotic spectacle, are irresistible, as is its insouciant way of combining the serious and the comic. Without the comedy, the drama would not be palatable.\u201d Read the full review Ash Is Purest White Jia Zhangke\u2019s latest offering is a frequently glorious drama about how one woman\u2019s journey from self-sacrificial moll to avenging criminal echoes her country\u2019s embrace of capitalism. What we said: \u201cA gripping parable for the vanity of human wishes, and an impassioned portrait of national malaise.\u201d Read the full review Eighth Grade An affecting lead performance anchors this outstanding debut from comic Bo Burnham about a vulnerable young teen. What we said: \u201cThere is something anaesthetised or at least tonally ambiguous in this gripping drama about a teenage girl in the US about to enter high school. Elsie Fisher is absolutely outstanding in the role of Kayla Day, like an undiscovered Fanning sister: her smart, observant performance gives the audience instant access to her vulnerabilities, hurt feelings and quiet determination.\u201d Read the full review Irene\u2019s Ghost Iain Cunningham\u2019s profound documentary about the strange fate of his late mother. What we said: \u201cI won\u2019t say exactly what happened to her, but the tragedy of it is that today she\u2019d have had every chance of recovery. The film is a love letter to Irene, yet the emotional balance finally tips to Cunningham\u2019s dad \u2013 ending with an unexpectedly tender moment between the two men.\u201d Read the full review Long Shot Charlize Theron\u2019s restrained politician falls for Seth Rogen\u2019s outlandish journalist in a crowdpleasing comedy. What we said: \u201cIt\u2019s Rogen\u2019s wheelhouse, and he\u2019s dependably hilarious whether exploding into a bombastic yet awkward speech, getting up to stoner shenanigans, or pratfalling down a flight of stairs. What\u2019s pleasantly surprising is how well he\u2019s matched by Theron.\u201d Read the full review High Life Robert Pattinson\u2019s astronaut on an odyssey to a distant black hole faces parenting challenges \u2013 and existential panic \u2013 in Claire Denis\u2019s space drama. What we said: \u201cAs with so many of Denis\u2019s films, the point is to contrive an overwhelmingly powerful mood and moment, an almost physiological sensation, this one incubated in the vast, cold reaches of space. It throbbed and itched with me long after the film was over.\u201d Read the full review Madeline\u2019s Madeline Molly Parker plays a theatre director throwing the spotlight on her young star\u2019s mental-health issues in this intense drama. What we said: \u201cThe movie\u2019s tone and its narrative arc are intriguingly elusive. At various times, it resembles Roman Polanski\u2019s Repulsion, Charlie Kaufman\u2019s Synecdoche, New York and Alan Parker\u2019s Fame. It\u2019s an immersive and exotic experience.\u201d Read the full review Amazing Grace Long-suppressed Aretha Franklin documentary, shot by Sydney Pollack during recording sessions in a Los Angeles church. What we said: \u201cI felt wrung out at the end of this film. How incredible must it have been for those who were there in person.\u201d Read the full review Birds of Passage Ciro Guerra-directed drama about marijuana trafficking in Colombia and the culture of the indigenous people involved. What we said: \u201cThere is also an extraordinary scene depicting a \u2018second wake\u2019 in An\u00edbal\u2019s property: a ceremony involving the exhumation of a dead body in a coffin and the solemn removal of body parts while alcohol is sprayed around like holy water. Are these ceremonies accurately reported? I don\u2019t know. But the film shows cultural expressions being intensified and warped by the new energies of the drug trade.\u201d Read the full review Bacurau A horror-style western about a Brazilian outback town under siege from a mysterious threat. What we said: \u201cIt is a really strange film, beginning in a kind of ethno-anthropology and documentary style, becoming a poisoned-herd parable or fever dream and then a Jacobean-style bloodbath. It is an utterly distinctive film-making, executed with ruthless clarity and force.\u201d Read the full review Aladdin Guy Ritchie\u2019s adaptation was widely anticipated to be awful; in fact it came out lively, colourful and funny, with only judicious tweaks to the original. What we said: \u201cIt has felt like Will Smith\u2019s mojo really is trapped inside a lamp, after what seems like a decade of miserable and self-important \u2018serious\u2019 roles which reached their nadir with After Earth and Collateral Beauty. Smith seizes his chance to let it out again and do what he does best. His Genie is less cartoonishly manic than Williams\u2019s; more human, you could say. But he\u2019s still the life of the party: part-Queer Eye makeover guru, part-Siri in human form, part-romcom best buddy \u2013 with perhaps a touch of Hitch, the professional matchmaker Smith played in 2005.\u201d Read the full review Booksmart Olivia Wilde\u2019s directorial debut is a funny, filthy, female-fronted competitor to Superbad that boasts its own distinctive style. What we said: \u201cBooksmart is inclusive and progressive without feeling forced and announces Wilde, an actor who hasn\u2019t always found her groove on screen, as a major director. Her film reaches the audience-friendly highs of a studio comedy while retaining an indie sensibility, both in its visuals and its tone, and coupled with the script\u2019s rooted awareness of the moment we\u2019re now in, it feels fresh, a film that will be rewatched and quoted, held on a pedestal by those who understand its necessity.\u201d Read the full review John McEnroe: In the Realm of Perfection The tempestuous tennis star wages war against the world in documentary-maker Julien Faraut\u2019s philosophical portrait. What we said: \u201cMcEnroe makes a fascinating focal point. Faraut seeks to elevate him as a singularly tortured creative, an auteur in sports socks. His face set in that teenage De Niro scowl, he offers no celebration, not even a fist pump; coaches will recoil at his tendency to stop after each shot, as if anticipating the worst. There are electrifying moments where he stares down the lens mid-match with that signature mix of aggression and derision.\u201d Read the full review Sunset Son of Saul director L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes deftly conjures the death throes of the Austro-Hungarian empire in an atmospheric mystery drama. What we said: \u201cIt\u2019s a very mysterious and even bizarre film in many ways, shot in what is becoming Nemes\u2019 signature style: long takes, a persistent closeup on the lead character\u2019s face, and a shallow focus that allows the surrounding reality to intrude only intermittently. The dialogue is often spoken in a subdued murmur, as if each speaker is in possession of a secret.\u201d Read the full review Freedom Fields Naziha Arebi\u2019s visually arresting documentary focuses on the courage of the country\u2019s fledgling national women\u2019s football team. What we said: \u201cWhere Hollywood opted for facile gender-flipping in its recent Ocean\u2019s 11 remake, it could have been more adventurous in search of meaningful Time\u2019s Up-era material. This superbly made, stirring documentary introduces us to what you might call Fadwa\u2019s XI \u2013 the fledgling Libyan women\u2019s football team. And there\u2019s something of the heist about the clandestine training sessions they are forced to organise in the face of Islamists trying to brandish the red card.\u201d Read the full review Gloria Bell Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio adapted his own Chilean drama from 2013 about a single divorcee looking for late-life love; this English-language version stars Julianne Moore in an exceptional performance. What we said: \u201cA virtual shot-for-shot remake of [Lelio\u2019s] first film, right down to the Almod\u00f3var-esque flourish of its final confrontation \u2026 Gloria is a wonderful part for Moore, and it is fascinating to put this picture alongside Moore\u2019s contrasting triumph Still Alice, the study of a middle-aged woman succumbing to early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d Read the full review Dirty God Tough, unflinching drama about the aftermath of an acid attack on a young woman, who has to cope with the appalling reality of her injuries. What we said: \u201cFirst-time actor Vicky Knight shows tremendous nerve and courage playing an acid-attack survivor in Sacha Polak\u2019s gritty, grounded London drama. In real-life, the 23-year-old was scarred in a fire as a child ... well, not only is she brave, she\u2019s good, too, inhabiting her funny, impulsive, often unlikable character utterly.\u201d Read the full review Mother Documentary about dementia carers in Thailand, who make a living from Europeans outsourcing the oversight of their relatives, but whose own family lives are affected in consequence. What we said: \u201cKristof Bilsen\u2019s film is a radical achievement: a love letter to loss, sacrifice and yearning. It questions how we care for elderly loved ones, makes provocative contrasts between east and west in the economics of medicine, and, with a central character who\u2019s pure charisma, this is intimate observational documentary-making of a high standard.\u201d Read the full review Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese Playful, not-entirely-factual memoir of Dylan\u2019s celebrated 1975 tour of small town America, orchestrated by Scorsese in the latest in his string of great musician docs. What we said: \u201cAt 78, [Bob Dylan] moves into a new phase of self-creation with this intriguing, fascinating, perplexing, sometimes exasperating film directed by Martin Scorsese \u2013 which is to say Scorsese has supervised a witty curatorial edit of archive film material, and in effect collaborated with Dylan in another artistic act of self-reshaping.
