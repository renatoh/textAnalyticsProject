They have got no chance. It\u2019s a different game \u2026 11 across the park, I don\u2019t like it.\u201d The plain-speaking centenarian also gave his considered view on scrums \u2013 \u201cBloody awful. A load of blokes falling down\u201d \u2013 with a magisterial certainty that all but scorched a hole through the sports section of the Daily Telegraph. Out of touch? Hardly. In many ways he was simply echoing the growing number of ex-players who worry their sport is turning into American football in front of their (broken) noses. \u201cI look at rugby now and it is just brutal,\u201d says Damian Hopley, the former England centre who is the chief executive of the players\u2019 union, the Rugby Players\u2019 Association. \u201cPart of rugby\u2019s great attraction is its gladiatorial nature \u2026 but it is becoming so collision-based.\u201d En route to Twickenham, the Aviva Stadium or Murrayfield this weekend, you might also ponder the verdict of Dan Cole, an England prop of slightly more recent vintage. He reckons front-rowers, in particular, are destined to grow even bigger and faster, further diminishing the odds for smaller guys looking to elude largely static tight forwards. \u201cThe economics of the world market have opened the game up to Polynesians who are naturally that big,\u201d Cole says. \u201cIf you\u2019re 100kg and you\u2019re scrummaging against someone who\u2019s 145kg it doesn\u2019t help. But that\u2019s the way the game is going. With front-row substitutions you\u2019re going to get bigger people because you don\u2019t have to do an 80-minute shift.\u201d Stir in the continuing concussion debate \u2013 this week the Rugby Football Union released figures showing reported instances in the Premiership rose by 59% in 2013-14 \u2013 and the human breeze blocks now occupying back-line positions once reserved for dancing feet and it becomes ever more obvious rugby is changing. It has altered beyond recognition around the breakdown, in midfield and aerially \u2013 to name but three aspects \u2013 inside the past decade. Which begs urgent questions: how will the sport look in five or 10 years\u2019 time at current rates of progression? And what are the proactive answers that put players\u2019 welfare uppermost? Because if the game continues to worship purely at the altar of size and strength, things are going to get messy. Sure, an excess of muscle can be tempting but so are all harmful addictions. When Jonah Lomu blazed his destructive trail across the 1995 World Cup an All Black fan sent a fax \u2013remember them? \u2013 to the team in South Africa. \u201cRemember rugby is a team game,\u201d it read. \u201cAll 14 of you pass the ball to Jonah!\u201d It was a joke but no one is laughing now. Our fields are full of Jonahs, making life ever tougher for willowy sprinters such as Jonny May, the slim England winger with dynamite in his boots. Every summer the brilliant May gazes at the latest crop of Gloucester academy players with creeping horror. \u201cEach year I think: \u2018Blimey, these guys are getting bigger, they\u2019re faster, they\u2019re fitter.\u2019 A few years ago some forwards could get away with just being heavy and one\u2011dimensional. Not any more. Everyone has no option but to push themselves harder. I definitely think careers aren\u2019t going to be as long because of the demands we\u2019re under.\u201d Which is why Hopley, who had to retire at 27 because of injury himself, reckons the game\u2019s administrators cannot afford to dither. \u201cSomewhere down the track we\u2019ve got to address some of these issues in the laws of the game,\u201d he stresses, repeating his belief that the season structure and volume of matches also need urgent attention. World Rugby (formerly the IRB) is due to undertake its usual review after this autumn\u2019s Rugby World Cup and a 15-man committee is set to meet in late April to discuss any proposed law amendments. However, as the ex-Lions flanker John Jeffrey and current WR committee chairman, said on Friday, knee-jerk decisions help nobody in the long term. It will be 2018 before Test rugby looks any different, at the earliest. For the players\u2019 sake, however, something other than their bones and ligaments has to give. Rugby is a contact sport, true, but it is also meant to be a game of evasion. In stark contrast to the marauding rucking of Jeffrey\u2019s era, we are seeing a far more upright, claustrophobic product, a blur of choke-tackles, jackals (turning the ball over after a tackle), guards and blitz defences, all of which have muscled into rugby\u2019s lexicon. Ben Youngs, England\u2019s scrum-half, also points out that enhanced video analysis is ramping up the pressure even more. \u201cIt becomes harder because guys are aware of what you are doing. I guarantee this weekend that Sergio Parisse will be coming for me at every ruck. When I am passing left he will be trying to grab me. We have watched about 20 clips of him doing it.\u201d No wonder old-timers, particularly in France, are increasingly nostalgic for the instinctive days of Serge Blanco. Rugby, at its best, remains a compelling spectacle but the higher the stakes the less space exists. Hence the widespread joy at the displays of Jonathan Joseph and George Ford last week; it felt like a rare victory for specialist craftsmen over hard-running line-breakers. Hopley, though, fears commercial imperatives will delay any reduction in games played and, consequently, the injury toll. \u201cSuch things tend to be left behind because it doesn\u2019t suit the bottom line of the unions. \u201cI actually have a lot of sympathy for World Rugby because they\u2019re governed by the very unions they\u2019re supposed to govern. I look enviously at the commissioners in America who make decisions in the best interests of their sport. Funnily enough, American sport looks pretty successful to me.\u201d Hopley also makes the point that the amateur and professional games continue to diverge. \u201cThere has been a lot talked about the seamless game. It\u2019s an absolute nonsense. They\u2019re two separate sports now and they should be treated as such.\u201d Either way, introducing weight limits at certain key age-group levels feels like a no-brainer if youthful skulls, joints and enthusiasm are to be better protected. Sadly, though, the world\u2019s lawyers will chorus \u201cRestraint of trade\u201d if the game ever sought to limit, say, the number of players weighing more than 100kg in a senior match-day squad. As May reminds us, rugby is like the Olympics, where times continually improve: \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to be happy with where you are, we all have to look to get better.\u201d Which is fine on the track or in the pool but presents a major dilemma on an already crowded pitch. Ditch flankers and permit only 13 players on the field? Reduce the number of tactical substitutions? Doing nothing is no longer an option in the eyes of many. \u201cAt what point do the players say: \u2018Enough,\u2019\u201d asks Hopley, rhetorically. \u201cIt all comes back to leadership. Let\u2019s get the right people in the room, work out what we\u2019re trying to do and do it, with player safety at the heart of everything.\u201d Perhaps they should invite the redoubtable Harry Walker along."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
