The title was declared vacant by the WBC when Barrera's great Mexican rival Erik Morales decided to relinquish the title to fight in the heavier super-featherweight division. \"I have talked with the Las Vegas hotels and with the American television company HBO,\" said Brodie's promoter Barry Hearn yesterday, \"and they would be very keen on Brodie going over there. \"After what Barrera did to Naz [he outpointed Naseem Hamed in Las Vegas in April 2001] you could say that we owe him one.\" Brodie, 29, has lost only once in his 10-year professional career and is being paid around \u00a3100,000 for tomorrow's fight, but could expect three or four times that to face Barrera."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
