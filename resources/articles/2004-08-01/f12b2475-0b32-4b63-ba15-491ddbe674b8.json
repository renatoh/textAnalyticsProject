The current league leaders' move is not without an element of tit-for-tat enmity after the Bulls signed the Rhinos' former captain Iestyn Harris. Leeds, aware that St Helens found a \u00a3200,000 bid for Martin Gleeson from Warrington too tempting to refuse, are using the same tactics over Peacock. The 2003 Man of Steel still has a year left on his contract but the Bulls may decide to cash in early to avoid the possibility of losing him on a free transfer. Leeds want the 26-year-old as a replacement for Matt Adamson who is returning to Australia at the end of this campaign to join Canberra after three years in Yorkshire. Brian Noble, the Bulls coach, is expected to oppose any decision to sell Peacock but there will be departures from Odsal with the Great Britain prop Paul Anderson expected to move on along with the Kiwi loose forward Logan Swann who is being tipped to join Warrington as a replacement for the retiring Mike Forshaw. However two other New Zealanders - the centre Shontayne Hape and the prop Joe Vagana - are ready to agree new contracts with the Bulls who also remain at the head of the queue for Leeds's out-of- contract forward Danny Ward. Warrington would push the boat out for the Wakefield skipper Gareth Ellis who is a free agent next year but the Wildcats do not want to sell and will offer the Great Britain centre a \u00a3100,000-a-season contract as they build a side round the game's most sought after English player. Castleford's centre Paul Mellor is joining the army of Australian players heading home at the end of the season. The 29-year-old is rejoining his former club Cronulla on a one-year contract. St Helens have checked on the availability of the New Zealand Warriors centre Clinton Toopi as a replacement for Gleeson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
