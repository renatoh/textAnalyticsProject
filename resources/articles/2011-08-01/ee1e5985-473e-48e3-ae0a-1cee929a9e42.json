For James Collins and Richard Dunne a second clean sheet in three matches represented another step on the road to redemption in the wake of last season's trials and tribulations at Aston Villa. \"We defended really well and got back to what we are used to doing,\" Collins said. Collins and Dunne, lest it be forgotten, were disciplined in March for their part in a drink-fuelled fracas at a spa resort that turned a team-bonding exercise into an internal investigation. On the field things were little better for the pair during a season when they looked unrecognisable from the solid defensive partnership that flourished on Martin O'Neill's watch 12 months earlier. Although Collins accepts that their standards dropped and admits they are desperate to put things right, the Welshman also suggested there were underlying problems last season. He admitted there was a \"clash of personalities\" with G\u00e9rard Houllier and described training under the Frenchman's successor, Alex McLeish, as \"a million times better\". \"Me and Dunney want to try and write off last season. We were not at our best \u2013 we know that,\" Collins said. \"There were certain things going on but both of us feel we can get back to being like the year we signed [in 2009], when we showed our best form. \"We both came back really fit pre-season. We just want to prove we are good defenders. We got a bit of criticism last year for not playing like we can do. But the training has been great [under McLeish]. It has been completely different and so much better \u2013 we have benefited from that. Training is a million times better.\" While it always seemed likely that Villa would improve defensively under McLeish, the worry is that goals could be harder to come by at the other end. Darren Bent was frustrated to see Ashley Young and Stewart Downing leave this summer and it came as no surprise to hear McLeish admit that the England striker was \"frustrated\" with the lack of service he received here. Gabriel Agbonlahor was a constant threat and Charles N'Zogbia will get better but Emile Heskey is not an attacking midfielder and never will be. Five points from three games still represents a reasonable enough start for McLeish, although not as good as the two wins and a draw Wolves have picked up. Mick McCarthy, whose defensive substitutions went down badly with the travelling supporters but succeeded in knocking Villa out of their stride, appears to be reaping the rewards from some astute recruitment. \"There's a bit of momentum, which you would expect really,\" the Wolves manager said. \"I think when Jamie O'Hara came he added a bit of confidence to the lads. I think he was personally surprised at the quality of the players we had in the squad and he said to them: 'We're better than this.' That breeds a good feeling.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
