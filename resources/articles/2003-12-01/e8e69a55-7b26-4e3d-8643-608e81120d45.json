The US scrapped the tariffs imposed in March last year 16 months ahead of schedule. The White House said the tariffs, which increased the price of some imported steel by as much as 30%, had done their job of giving the ailing US steel industry breathing space to restructure and cut costs. Was there a political motive for the tariffs in the first place? Most certainly. George Bush needed political support from key states such as Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, all of which produce steel, in advance of last year's mid-term elections. What about their support now? He does risk alienating steel producers and unions in those states before next November's presidential election. But Mr Bush's political advisers had concluded that the tariffs were counterproductive. Companies that used foreign steel, such as car makers, complained that higher steel prices were eroding their profits in a generally tough environment for US manufacturing. Was there a threat of retaliation? This was another reason for Mr Bush to back down. After the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruled that the US tariffs were illegal, the EU threatened to impose sanctions of up to $2.2bn (\u00a31.5bn) on US imports such as citrus, textile products and Harley-Davidson motorbikes. Why those products? The EU measures were designed to inflict maximum pain upon US manufacturers based in \"swing states\" that would have been crucial to Mr Bush's re-election. Mr Bush may also have wanted to do a favour for his friend Tony Blair, who had lobbied hard for the US to drop the tariffs. What impact did the tariffs have in the US? That has been less than clear cut. In late September, two reports from the international trade commission, a US government agency, said that the case was muddy and that it was difficult to determine whether the tariffs or changing market conditions were responsible for the problems of steel consumers. What has the US steel industry been up to? The industry has invested more than $3bn in a restructuring effort. Smaller companies have either gone bankrupt or been absorbed by larger ones. Steel officials say that the restructuring effort will be undermined now the tariffs have been lifted, and they have accused the EU of trying to blackmail the US. What is the state of the world steel industry? The industry has been in a dire state, with too much capacity. That has been a problem for European as well as US companies. The Anglo-Dutch firm Corus, for example, has had to lay off thousands of workers. However, with the global economy picking up, trade experts say that steel shortages could emerge next year, boosting prices and providing respite for producers in the US and elsewhere. Are there other trade disputes between the US and the EU? This is the problem. Steel was not the only issue bedevilling EU-US trade. The most serious row involves US export subsidies, which the WTO found illegal. In that instance, the WTO has authorised the EU to impose up to $4bn worth of sanctions, which would be by far the largest in WTO history. Brussels, however, has held off on the measures, pending the passage in Congress of new tax legislation that would eliminate the subsidies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
