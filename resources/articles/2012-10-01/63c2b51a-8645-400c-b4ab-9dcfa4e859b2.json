The annual ritual is not what it once was, but then neither is the electorate. In the 1950s, nine out of 10 would cast their vote in elections; that era has passed. It may seem difficult to imagine now, but passion, rebellion and agenda-changing debates were once the conference mainstay. In the 90s, for instance, Norman Tebbit won a standing ovation when he embarrassed John Major's government as he railed against the EU's Maastricht treaty. Again, when Tony Blair told conference he was dropping Clause Four and Labour's commitment to nationalisation, that, too, was an electrifying moment, the significance of which reached far beyond the conference hall. Currently, the scale of the challenge facing Britain is immense: how to achieve growth; the impact of deep cuts to the welfare state that stretch beyond 2016; stagnating wages; ever-increasing food and fuel prices; and the continuing EU crisis, to name only a few. But have the parties used their conferences to provide us with the means to address these challenges? In key respects, the answer is no. The appeals made to the electorate have appeared at best muted and disconnected, at worst divisive, shallow and misanthropic, pitching one nebulous tribe against another, \"us\" against the affluent \"them\", strivers against skivers. This year, more than ever, in format, rhetoric and content, the Liberal-Democrats, Labour and Conservative conferences seemed out of touch, not least with their own dwindling band of supporters, many of whom have neither the time nor the budget to attend a jamboree over several days in which, robust fringe debates apart, docility and deference are the norm. We live in an era of social media, phenomena such as the global, web-based TED talks and innovatory grassroots activism such as the internet-based 38 degrees. In that context, as Katie Ghose of the Electoral Reform Society points out, the unchanging conference paraphernalia of platform, podium and captive audience add weight to the notion that the past three weeks have been the exclusive business of a traditional travelling political class that rightly or wrongly, in the eyes of many of the electorate, are \"all the same\". That has to change. The centrepiece of this conference season was, inevitably, the resurrection of the reputation for leadership of each of the leaders. In the event, Miliband surprised the most, springing to life as a rounded man with a prodigious memory; Cameron defensively sought to define in greater detail his \"compassionate Conservatism\"; while Clegg struggled to explain, with little oratorical polish, how he is not like the other half of the coalition of which he is a part. Propaganda and political posturing are a traditional part of conference life, particularly so in midterm. However, now more than ever, that familiar format needs to be set aside in favour of more serious, inclusive and imaginative speeches and debates about the choices ahead and the outcomes of the different strategies proposed by each of the parties. And the outcomes will undoubtedly be very different. Even once growth is restored, we face a profoundly altered social terrain that demands fresh political responses. We need to define the economy we wish to establish and decide how we think the tensions and imbalances between its constituent parts are organised. It is time for politicians to be honest about the hardships that lie ahead. This will require party leaderships to explore radical policies that have so far been relegated to the fringe of debate. A new element in the reshaping of the welfare state ought to include the living wage. Set at \u00a37 20 an hour against the minimum wage of \u00a36 19, it has growing support from a range of employers and across the political spectrum, including Boris Johnson. It offers the beginning of a realistic basic income, it helps to tackle child poverty, and it takes a step away from taxpayers subsidising the wages of the poorest because too many employers pay too little. It was, however, a marginalised issue during the conference season, as was the question of childcare. How childcare is made available to all who require it, the manner in which the cost is shared and the methods by which quality is maintained are all part of a discussion vital for the prosperity of the country. Just as party leaders should embrace radical, fresh ideas, so too should they eschew simplistic characterisations that sow divisions. Demonising groups in society is a dangerous tactic. Tory attempts to scapegoat lone mothers in the 1980s backfired, as it became obvious that everybody knew somebody who was a lone parent and who defied the scrounger stereotype. Likewise today, a third of the population at some point in their lives receive benefits. The major challenge is not fecklessness but how good people weather the insecurity of perpetual short-term, dead-end jobs. The electorate is increasingly sophisticated. It is well aware that choices taken now will define the basic principles of fairness, social justice and community cohesion (or the lack of it) that mould our society for decades to come. Yet, according to the political research charity, the Hansard Society, the public is \"disgruntled, disillusioned and disengaged\" with politics That is alarming; a derogation of democracy. As citizens, we have a duty to vote. However, not voting may be more than apathy\u2013 it can be a political act. In the last election, 16 million did not use the ballot box. Over half of those who did cast their votes, voted for a loser. Frustration is palpable. According to the pollsters YouGov, the \"big beast\" political performances at conference have made little impact on ratings. At a time when we need the voting population to be most engaged, too many are turning away. Recent aborted attempts at political reform can't have helped. \"If the medicine's not working,\" Ed Miliband said in his conference speech, \"you change the medicine.\" Before addressing the antidote, it is imperative that politicians of all parties consider whether they have the correct diagnosis of what the electorate seeks in a modern-day democracy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
