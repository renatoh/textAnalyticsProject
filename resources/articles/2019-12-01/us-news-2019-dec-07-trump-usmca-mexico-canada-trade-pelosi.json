If the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, \u201cdoesn\u2019t move quickly\u201d to approve the deal, the president tweeted, it \u201cwill collapse!\u201d In contrast, a senior Mexican diplomat told reporters in Washington negotiators were close to concluding revisions. \u201cWe\u2019re getting close, I\u2019m confident,\u201d J\u00e9sus Seade, the deputy foreign minister for North America, told reporters outside the US trade representative\u2019s office. He said he would probably return on Monday to continue talks. On Friday evening, he had said many issues still needed to be resolved. One point of contention is over steel, after the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, made a last-minute demand for a revised definition of what would constitute North American steel under automotive rules of origin. Mexico approved the USMCA this year but US ratification has been held up by Democrats who have voiced concerns over the enforcement of labor and environmental provisions. \u201cHard to believe,\u201d Trump tweeted on Saturday, \u201cbut if Nancy Pelosi had put our great Trade Deal with Mexico and Canada, USMCA, up for a vote long ago, our economy would be even better. If she doesn\u2019t move quickly, it will collapse!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
