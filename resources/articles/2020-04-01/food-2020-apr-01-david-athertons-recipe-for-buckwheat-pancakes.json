You can top with whatever you like, sweet or savoury, and if you can\u2019t get buckwheat flour you can substitute wholemeal, spelt or rye. The suggestion below is a nod to the traditional Breton galettes de sarrasin, with the amaranth and raw blue cheese helping to feed your gut microbes, but after the first savoury round I go sweet with banana, walnut and honey. Makes 8 120g buckwheat flour (or wholemeal, spelt or rye) 60g plain flour 40g amaranth seeds (optional) 1 sachet (7g) of fast-action yeast 1 medium egg 400ml warm water For the filling (for four pancakes) 200g field mushrooms Olive oil Salt and pepper 60g spinach 2 cloves of garlic, crushed 4 medium eggs 50g unpasteurised blue cheese Mix all the pancake ingredients together in a bowl and leave for two hours. Gently fry the mushrooms in a glug of olive oil until browned, then season and add the spinach and garlic. Fry for another minute, until the spinach has wilted. Put a non-stick frying pan on a medium/high heat, lightly grease with olive oil and pour in a ladle of batter. Allow to cook for 2-3 minutes without poking around at the pancake, then gently flip. Crack an egg in the middle, season it and cook gently until it is just done (I cover with a lid). Scatter the mushrooms and spinach around the egg and crumble the cheese on top. Gently fold up four sides to make a square and slide on to a plate to eat while warm. Repeat until you run out of eggs, then move on to the next topping."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
