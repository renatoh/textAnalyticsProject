That's not strictly true, of course. The people whose ornate trading rituals were analysed by the drummer, Matt Helders, were actually found on the Zambezi. And the band did smile once, in a portrait by the photographer Perou that formed part of the promotional material for Favourite Worst Nightmare. But they don't make a habit of it. Neither do they enjoy attending awards ceremonies - preferring to send video messages dressed as characters from the Wizard of Oz - or indulge their fans' exuberance (lead singer Alex Turner to a fan clambering on to a friend's shoulders during the Monkeys' recent comeback gig: \"Oh, sit the fuck down\"). They certainly don't enjoy doing interviews with the press, radio or television. It's such an efficient bucking of the usual system of marketing a band, in fact, that it's the most effective marketing around. Not that the Monkeys are alone at winning the game by refusing to play it. Pete Doherty can continue his Sisyphean efforts at funding an expensive drug habit thanks, in part, to a reluctance to do what is expected of him. Over in sport, meanwhile, the tennis prodigy Andy Murray is in the world's top 10, but he is almost equally well known for his scowl and his forthright criticism of those who run the game. So when Murray signs a \u00a31m sponsorship deal with Highland Spring mineral water, his agent explains: \"He doesn't do commercial smiles. That's why he's so credible with his generation. And that's what companies are attracted to.\" Which sums up the perversity of popular culture right here and now. That's not to say that any of these artists - OK, I will say it of Doherty - are at all disingenuous in their behaviour. It's just that we're beyond the point where any rebellious activity can't be reclaimed and resold to a target demographic within 24 hours (choosing one at random, an ABC1 office-based media worker, aged 31 and desperate to get in touch with his inner teenage rebel). Elsewhere - and more frequently than ever - The Man and The Artist twirl gaily together hand in hand, through sponsored festivals and \"secret\" gigs to creative associations, \"curated projects\" and simple straightforward endorsements. To sell your music or images to an advertiser is no longer a sellout, just a strategic brand association. Which makes it all the more galling that when someone does try to buck the system, the system applauds with its many pairs of hands, relieved to have a new angle to sell its product. Some, such as the academics Joseph Heath and Andrew Potter in their book The Rebel Sell, insist that selling is itself an act of selling out. And surely even the Monkeys would have wanted their records to be heard by as many people as they could - except perhaps by the scummy men and those in T-shirt and tie combinations. But the idea that we have reached the end of cultural history, that nothing can be invented that doesn't have a box ready to contain it and a space reserved for it on the shelf, does seem to take the fun out if it a little. Long gone are the days of Johnny Rotten's statement, after the Sex Pistols were dropped by EMI for constant misbehaviour, that \"all we're trying to do is destroy everything\". Such destruction is now a practical impossibility. Any creative attempts at destroying the music industry would only inspire a \"Destroy the man\" tour, album and commemorative set of plastic hammers. paul.macinnes@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
