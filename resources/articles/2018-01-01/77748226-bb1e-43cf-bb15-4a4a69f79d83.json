For one of Itoje\u2019s most vivid memories of winning his first England cap \u2013 coming off the bench in Rome in February 2016 \u2013 is not his first touch of the ball nor the final words of wisdom from Eddie Jones but the joy it brought his father, Efe, in the crowd. It lingers in his memory because Itoje grew up watching the Six Nations \u2013 the first he recalls is 2006 \u2013 at boarding school from the age of 11 to 18, first at St George\u2019s in Harpenden, then at Harrow, rather than at home with his family, until that Sunday afternoon in Italy broke the mould. \u201cFrom the second I walked on that pitch I then became an England player, something I\u2019d been working towards for quite a while,\u201d Itoje said. \u201cIt was a surreal moment for me, a great day for myself and my family to enjoy. My dad came to that game and I remember seeing how happy he was. He was probably even more happy than me.\u201d These days, however, Efe and Maro\u2019s mother, Florence, are fully fledged rugby converts. \u201cThey absolutely live for the away days, they live for the Twickenham days,\u201d Itoje said. \u201cTheir weekends are now built around watching rugby and it has now got to a point where it doesn\u2019t even matter if I am not playing. They go and watch Saracens if I am playing or not. They watch England even if I am not playing.\u201d That 40-9 win in Rome was Jones\u2019s second game in charge of England; the coach had resisted the temptation to blood Itoje, then 21, at Murrayfield in his first. Indeed, back then, Jones repeatedly sought to temper expectations over Itoje, often bemoaning the lack of battle scars he wore, but two years on it is safe to say the Vauxhall Viva analogy has been sent to the scrapheap. Itoje now has 14 England caps as well as three for the British &amp; Irish Lions and he has lost only one Test he has started. A bruised hip has affected his preparations for this year\u2019s Six Nations Championship and his training schedule during the national team\u2019s Portugal camp last week was tailored accordingly. Provided Itoje comes through training this week as expected, however, there is little chance of him spending any time back on the Stadio Olimpico bench. \u201cI probably understand the game better now. I like to think I\u2019ve improved as a player as well,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve matured since then. This is my third Six Nations, that was my first cap. I\u2019ve definitely matured as a player and a person since then. But I like to think I wasn\u2019t submissive when I came on [in 2016]. Going out there it\u2019s about imposing myself on the game as best I can. \u201cMy attitude hasn\u2019t really changed. For me it is always trying to push the boundaries, always try to get better and improve my own performances. It doesn\u2019t matter if I have played my first game or whatever game, it is about getting better and trying to push your performances. It is unlikely that every game you will get better but as long as there is an upward trend you can live with it.\u201d Last year against Italy, England found themselves 10-5 down at half\u2011time at Twickenham, having been ambushed by their visitors\u2019 \u201cno ruck\u201d tactics. Last week, though, the defence coach, Paul Gustard, challenged his side to adopt a \u201chunting mentality\u201d as they seek a record\u2011breaking third Six Nations crown. \u201cWe want to be the aggressors, we want to take the game by the scruff of the neck, we don\u2019t want to be submissive in anything,\u201d Itoje said. \u201cThere was a bit of frustration after the game [last year]. You live and you learn from it but you can\u2019t dwell on it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
