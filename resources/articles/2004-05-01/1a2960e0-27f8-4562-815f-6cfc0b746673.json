Martin Bright checks out the 'five-star' Pen- y -cwm hostel in Pembrokeshire to see how the youth hostel has come of age. A five-star youth hostel. That has to be a joke, right? It's all relative, but this is a far cry from the traditional steel-framed beds, Cup-a-Soup and anorak image. The en-suite family and couples' rooms are comfortable and unpretentious. So no chores then? The tradition of helping with the housework has long been abandoned in most hostels. Although it isn't exactly a place to chill out, Pen-y-cwm does have a recreation room with table tennis, games and a TV, and croquet in summer. What about the food? Not quite the 'cordon-bleu' experience advertised and it must be booked before 10am, but, as with the rooms, the food is simple and unpretentious. A decent lamb roast washed down with a perfectly adequate Italian House red was most welcome after a long drive from London. Isn't the YHA closing down hostels? It has had image problems for years. Perhaps it should change its name, a turn-off for some. It should also be more bullish about its attractions. Pen-y-cwm is a potential model for cheap, no-frills hotels of the future. \u00b7Pen-y-cwm hostel, Solva, near Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire (0870 770 5988).
