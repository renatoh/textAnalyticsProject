It evolved from the Stockholm quartet\u2019s score for Lotte Reiniger\u2019s 1926 silent animated film The Adventures of Prince Achmed, and takes its title \u2013 the Swedish for \u201cwitch\u201d \u2013 from one of the characters. Their psychedelic jazz-rock evokes 70s Italian giallo horror movies, or perhaps Popol Vuh\u2019s soundtracks for Werner Herzog. There are many beautiful tracks, such as the haunting Peri Banu Vid Sj\u00f6n, or the creepy Kalifen, whose broad organ chords carry a whiff of Procol Harum. There are disorienting moments too, such as Wak-Wak\u2019s Portar, which seesaws across the stereo, or the title track, which begins with looming shapes before dissolving into a lysergic mist. Often their prettiest melodies are sometimes only glimpsed, such as on the 30-seconds-long Den Fattige Aladdin, but it\u2019s enough to give them space for more challenging pieces, such as the improvised freakout Andarnas Krig. Drummer Johan Holmegard is fabulous throughout, propelling Jakten Genom Skogen forward with a cymbal-heavy gallop while strings swoon above."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
