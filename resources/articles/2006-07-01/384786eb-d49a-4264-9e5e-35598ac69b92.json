The pounds 99.95 iHome IH5 has all the usual features, with integrated speakers and battery recharging, but it also moonlights as a radio alarm clock. It works with most iPods from the 3G model onwards, though if you are adding a nano you'll have to fit the accompanying adaptor. The company hasn't expended much effort on the design - it is rather plasticky and finished in white or black. A credit card-thin remote control moves tracks forwards and backwards, adjusts the volume and switches off the player. Other handy features include compatibility with any music player via a line-out socket and back-up battery power, which keeps the clock going if mains power fails. However, sound quality is limited and distorts if you pump up the volume. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
