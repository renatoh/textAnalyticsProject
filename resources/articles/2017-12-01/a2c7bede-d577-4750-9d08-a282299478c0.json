The comments from the shadow attorney general suggest that even if the high court finds Gallagher ineligible Labor will insist on further high court hearings to determine the cases of Josh Wilson, Justine Keay, and Susan Lamb. The cases could stretch the crisis of eligibility hanging over Australia\u2019s parliamentarians well into 2018 and stave off byelections in Labor-held seats for months if they are found ineligible. Gallagher, who is a senator, and lower house MPs Keay, and Wilson were all British citizens at the nomination date for the 2016 election, but Labor has refused to refer the MPs to the high court because they took \u201call steps reasonably required\u201d to renounce in time. On Friday Malcolm Turnbull said Keay and Wilson\u2019s fate \u201cwill be determined by the Gallagher case because the facts are essentially the same\u201d. \u201cIf Katy Gallagher is successful then they will rest easy. If she is unsuccessful then they will have to resign.\u201d On Sunday Dreyfus told ABC\u2019s Insiders that Labor believed Gallagher was eligible since she had taken \u201creasonable steps\u201d to renounce but had agreed to refer her because \u201cwe want this cleared up\u201d. \u201c[Gallagher], like the rest of us in Labor, cares about the constitutional legitimacy of the Australian parliament \u2026 and the high court will clear this up.\u201d Asked if Gallagher\u2019s case would provide a precedent for the other Labor MPs, Dreyfus replied: \u201cNot really. \u201cEach case has to be determined on the particular circumstances of the candidate or member concerned and Josh Wilson is a different case again,\u201d he said. Citizenship declarations this week revealed that Wilson sent his renunciation to the UK Home Office on 13 May, 2016, immediately after Labor dumped its previous candidate for Fremantle. He received his document stamped on 29 June confirming his renunciation, after the nomination date of 9 June. Dreyfus incorrectly claimed that Wilson was \u201cpre-selected the day before nominations closed\u201d. Wilson knew he was a dual citizen but \u201chadn\u2019t thought he was going to be a candidate\u201d, Dreyfus explained. \u201cHe did everything possible as quickly as he possibly could, but he only had 24 hours.\u201d A spokeswoman for Dreyfus clarified that Wilson had sent forms off within 24 hours of being preselected, rather than 24 hours before the nomination deadline. Keay applied to renounce in May 2016 but did not receive confirmation of her renunciation until 11 July. Keay, who was preselected 12 months out from the election, has since admitted she waited three months after receiving advice to renounce before sending off her form. Dreyfus said Keay\u2019s case demonstrated the point \u201cthat each person\u2019s circumstances are a lot different\u201d and added that he doesn\u2019t believe that fact made her case more difficult. Gallagher and Labor MP David Feeney were referred to the high court this week, but the government narrowly defeated a Labor and crossbench motion to send others including Lamb, Keay and Wilson; Liberals Julia Banks, Alex Hawke, Nola Marino and Jason Falinski; and the Nick Xenophon Team MP Rebekha Sharkie. Dreyfus accused Turnbull of turning a \u201cdisclosure system\u201d into a \u201cconcealment system\u201d, citing the fact Marino released a document clearing her of having Italian citizenship after the disclosure process. He said she still had questions to answer about whether she had US citizenship. Asked why Labor had queried Josh Frydenberg, whose citizenship status is caught up in the fact his mother fled Hungary to escape the Holocaust, Dreyfus said Labor had not singled him out but rather complained that a group of Liberal MPs had not made \u201cadequate disclosure\u201d. Dreyfus said he was sympathetic to Frydenberg\u2019s situation but it was \u201cnot for me to say \u2026 that the constitution shouldn\u2019t apply to him\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m very much hoping that he can demonstrate, by just giving some of the material facts, or releasing the legal advice, that he\u2019s got nothing to be concerned about. \u201cBut at the moment, his disclosure statements says nothing. It says that his mother, who escaped the Holocaust, was born in 1943 in Hungary and that\u2019s all it says. It says that he\u2019s got legal advice but he doesn\u2019t say what it says.\u201d The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, told Sky News on Sunday the government had already referred its MPs where they had issues and complained Labor had \u201cpicked at random\u201d four Coalition MPs to attempt to refer in a bid to protect four of its own. \u201cWhere it\u2019s clear now that people do have a problem in the Labor party, they should have been referred by Bill Shorten,\u201d he said. After filling a Senate vacancy in 2015, Gallagher submitted forms to renounce her British citizenship on 20 April, 2016 but the renunciation was not confirmed until 16 August. Sharkie is in the same situation of having renounced British citizenship before nominating but it was not effective until after the deadline. Lamb disclosed that she sent her renunciation form to the UK Home Office on 25 May 2016. The Home Office sought further information on 7 July and on 10 August it responded that it \u201ccannot be satisfied from the documents available\u201d that Lamb held British citizenship, and therefore refused her application to renounce."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
