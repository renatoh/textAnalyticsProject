Victoria Woodards, the mayor, said the video made her even more \u201cangered and disappointed\u201d about the death of Manuel Ellis, 33, who died in police custody of respiratory arrest on 3 March after calling out \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d. She instructed the Pierce county sheriff to review the actions taken by the officers on the scene. \u201cThe officers who committed this crime should be fired and prosecuted to the full extent of the law,\u201d said Woodards in a late-night press conference on Thursday after the video was released. The video, captured by a woman whose name has not been released, appears to show two officers repeatedly punching a man lying on the ground. The woman can be heard screaming from her car: \u201cStop. Oh my God, stop hitting him. Just arrest him.\u201d The death of Ellis, a musician and father of two, has been ruled a homicide and is being investigated by the Pierce county sheriff\u2019s department. The county medical examiner\u2019s officer reported that he died due to hypoxia and physical restraint. Other factors that may have contributed to his death included methamphetamine intoxication and heart disease. The four officers involved were placed on administrative leave following the arrest. The Tacoma police department said in a statement that they returned to full duty once it was determined \u201cthere were no known departmental violations\u201d. Earlier this week they were placed again on administrative leave. On Friday, the Tacoma city council unanimously approved sending a letter to the governor, Jay Inslee, requesting an independent review of Ellis\u2019s death. The letter was in response to Ellis\u2019s family pushing for a thorough and independent investigation involving the state. During the council meeting, Woodards also highlighted the need for the system to change, referencing the fact that she and the governor would look into establishing an independent review process for every officer-involved death in Washington. Ed Troyer, the Pierce county sheriff\u2019s spokesman, told the Guardian that the Tacoma police officers had noticed Ellis banging on car windows. When he came up to their car asking for help and saying there were warrants out for his arrest, an officer got out of the car. Ellis grabbed him by his vest and threw him to the ground, according to Troyer. The second officer then came out of the car and wrestled him into handcuffs. He was lying on the ground when he started saying he couldn\u2019t breathe. The officers turned him on to his side and called for medical units. The Washington senator Patty Murray said in a tweet on Thursday that her \u201cheart goes out to Manuel Ellis\u2019 family, those who loved him &amp; his community\u201d, and said she supported Inslee\u2019s push for an independent investigation. Ellis was a father to an 18-month-old daughter and 11-year-old son, according to a GoFundMe account created five days ago by Monet Carter-Mixon, Ellis\u2019s sister, and Black Lives Matter Seattle King county. As of Friday, the page had raised over $46,000. \u201cWe are proud of the man Manuel became, like so many black men in our community, his greatest achievements were grounded in his ability to transform trauma and personal struggles into victories,\u201d the fundraiser says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
