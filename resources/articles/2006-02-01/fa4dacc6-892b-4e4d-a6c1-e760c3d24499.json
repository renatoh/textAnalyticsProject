The analysis of the Danish cartoon fiasco by Onora O'Neill, principal of Newnham College, Cambridge, was great (A right to offend?, February 13). Just one thing, though, she wrote: \"Once we take account of the power of the media we are not likely to think that they should enjoy unconditional freedom of expression.\" Putting conditionality to one side, exactly what power does she think the media has? Nobody I know has ever quantified this, but I would love to know if she has. Kevin d'Arcy, executive secretary, Association of European Journalists, British Section, London E3 Cuba is safe for scribes Your lead story on the dangers facing journalists in Latin America (Shooting the messenger, February 13) highlights the way journalists have increasingly become easy targets for armed attack. However, the inclusion of Cuba in your list of countries that \"have poor records\" in this area seems rather eccentric. The odd critical journalist may be subjected to minor harassment, but there are no records of journalists being beaten up, killed or tortured. It must be one of the safest places for journalists, even if not the easiest, to work in. Despite the recent shooting in Mexico, the situation in Latin America has improved a lot, apart from in Colombia, where rightwing paramilitaries, the drug mafia and the army itself regularly threaten and shoot journalists. Where the situation has become much worse is in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan where journalists are caught between insurgents who hate the western media and the US army which hates the truth. John Green, Aberystwyth The trouble with drama The problem with television drama (Media FAQ, February 6) is the same as the problem with the creative industry in general ... nepotism. It does not generate creativity, diversity or innovation. In the US they use the best writers, not just a bunch of people from Oxbridge or an English literature graduate from some redbrick university, or someone's nephew, mate, partner or cousin. That is why we get this endless torrent of derivative crap. That is why I (and the majority of my peers) do not watch any UK drama and its figures will continue to fall, which is great for the networks as they will have a valid excuse to make more cheap reality TV. The networks need to wake up. I do not have to watch their monotonous, mono-toned drama when I can get all the quality drama I can cope with from TV box sets that I buy on the internet.
