As all flights out of Europe to the US were grounded and planes on their way across the Atlantic were recalled or diverted, British Airways lost nearly a quarter of its stock market value as its shares dived 58p to 208p. That reaction was mirrored in Germany, where Lufthansa shares finished down 23%. Among the main hotel groups, Hilton shares closed down 47p at 179p, Millennium &amp; Copthorne lost 37.5p to finish at 310p while Six Continents - the recently renamed former Bass group which operates international hotels such as the Holiday Inn and Intercontinental chains - dropped 105p to 606.5p. The huge falls were not directly caused by yesterday's events, but by worries about whether US tourists would now abandon their travel plans - and cause more problems for industries already hit by the downturn in bookings caused by the looming recession. The hotel and airline industries have felt the reverberations of Americans' fear of flying before. During the Gulf War, in the wake of previous terrorist outrages and even during the foot and mouth outbreak, they have lost vital US business. A spokeswoman for the British tourist authority said: \"With any form of terrorist attack involving the US the impact is immediate and lasting. After the Gulf War it took four to five years for the tourist industry here to recover.\" Americans account for 20% of incoming tourists. In the 12 months to February this year there were 4m US visitors to Britain, who spent \u00a32.5bn. The enormous scale of yesterday's horror left most companies unable to estimate how badly they will be hit. One leading City transport analyst said: \"We are all in new territory here. We have never lived through anything like this. I can't even begin to estimate the impact it will have. \"The Atlantic was already a difficult market for airlines and this will give Americans a new reason not to travel. It is not good news for the carriers\". Six Continents will undoubtedly feel the effects of the attacks in the UK, the US and around the world. The company is one of the world's biggest hotel operators, and has 23 hotels in New York City and 31 in Washington. A spokesman for the company said: \"Communications with the US are so difficult. It is too early to have a point of view about what the impact will be. \"Our main focus at the mo ment is the welfare of our people out there. Obviously travel to and from the US will be affected, but things are changing second by second\". A spokesman for Airtours, the tour operator which has a substantial US package tour business as well as a charter airline, said the company was not yet making any contingency plans for the possible impact on its business: \"Our focus is on ensuring that our customers and staff are safe and well and we are reviewing our flying programme with the authorities\". Airtours shares closed down 15p at 232p while rival First Choice closed down 9.5p at 120.5p. \u0095Two of Europe's top travel agents yesterday suspended all trips to the US in light of the bombings and the closure of airports throughout the country. Thomas Cook and its owner, Preussag of Germany, both called off package holidays to the region until Friday. Both companies have promised holidaymakers that they will be able to reschedule their vacations at no extra charge. Another Preussag company, Hapag Lloyd, was forced to divert two flights already en route to the US."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
