Juxtaposing 13-year-old Ofelia\u2019s fairytale journey into a forest full of beasts and fairies with the horror of Franco\u2019s fascist Spain, Funke layers and deepens the symbolism. It seems unlikely that many will come to the novel without some prior knowledge of one of the 21st-century\u2019s best-loved films. But more than a spinoff, this is a beautiful companion piece and a reminder of the haunting importance of Del Toro\u2019s initial vision. Swan Song Kelleigh Greenberg-Jephcott Cornerstone, \u00a312.99, pp480 Longlisted for this year\u2019s women\u2019s prize for fiction, Greenberg-Jephcott\u2019s debut is fizzing with energy and ideas that spilled out of her fascination with Truman Capote\u2019s fall from grace in the mid-70s. Impressively, she steers well clear of fashioning a writerly novel about writers; instead, this is as much about the six moneyed, beautiful, vulnerable and manipulated \u201cSwans\u201d who were very publicly betrayed by Capote\u2019s exposure of their secrets and lives. With some wonderfully vivid descriptions of the Manhattan (and global) social scene, the novel has style and substance in spades. A complex, readable and original character study. The Yellow Jersey Peter Cossins Vintage, \u00a325, pp336 This July, it will be 100 years since probably the most iconic shirt in all sport was first worn: le maillot jaune, pulled on by the rider leading the Tour de France to enable fans to identify the cyclist defending first place. Cossins, who won a major award for his last cycling book, adeptly tells the stories behind the men in yellow over the past century, exploring the strange power and responsibility bestowed upon the wearer \u2013 often as much a curse as a blessing. Lavish photography sometimes makes it feel a little like a nice coffee table book, but said table will be all the better for it. \u2022 To order Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, Swan Song or The Yellow Jersey, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.
