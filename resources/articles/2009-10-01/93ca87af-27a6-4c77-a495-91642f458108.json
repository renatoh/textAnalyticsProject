It's a fine film, but it wavers dangerously close to a gigantic Hollywood cliche: white people being healed by their encounters with darker-skinned people. If you thought this sort of thing had gone the way of Mammy in Gone With The Wind, look at some recent releases: THE VISITOR Richard Jenkins, another lonely old white guy, finds immigrants living in his apartment. But thanks to his new, naturally rhythmic Syrian buddy, he develops an interest in bongo-playing \u2013 and therefore life. He also develops an interest in Syrian immigrants' mothers once the son is deported \u2013 talk about benefits! THE SOLOIST Robert Downey Jr discovers babbling tramp Jamie Foxx is really a cello genius a few strings short of a concerto and pledges to rehabilitate him. He doesn't quite say, \"I thought I was helping that poor black man, but I realise now, he was helping me.\" But he might as well. THE DARJEELING LTD India is a great place for hipster Americans like Wes Anderson and co. It's full of crazy colourful shit and you can buy stuff like cobras dirt cheap. It's real spiritual, too. And little children die all the time there, which gives Adrien Brody and his bickering brothers the chance to learn there's more to life than custom-printed Louis Vuitton luggage sets. SEVEN POUNDS Having retrieved Matt Damon's golf mojo in The Legend Of Bagger Vance, Will Smith made a hostile bid for all-round saviourhood here. Through his compulsory organ donation scheme, he heals white folks, black folks, hispanic folks, blind folks, you name it. Call him a passive-agressive martyr and he'd rip out his pancreas and give it to you right there. FORREST GUMP Gump's best black buddy Bubba dies in his arms in 'Nam, thus giving Tom Hanks a big dramatic \"war is hell!\" moment, not to mention a future career in shrimp farming. If Gump hadn't rescued Lieutenant Dan first, mind you, he'd've had time to save Bubba. THE GREEN MILE Michael Clarke Duncan's gentle-giant convict is executed at the end of this Shawshank follow-up, but the important thing is, prison guard Tom Hanks (him again) cries tears of real pity as he flips the switch. Duncan hasn't just cured his urinary tract infection, you see, he's cured his racism, too. MORGAN FREEMAN Freeman has spent most of his career healing white folks' pain, through inspirational servitude (Driving Miss Daisy), godly benevolence (Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty), or rock-solid buddyhood (The Shawshank Redemption, Unforgiven, etc). Even the sound of the man's voice can cure white people's cancer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
