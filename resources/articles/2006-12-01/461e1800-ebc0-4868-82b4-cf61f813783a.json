At \u00a3180 the bottle (from Selfridges), Perrier-Jou\u00ebt's Belle Epoque Blanc de Blancs 1999 was comfortably the most expensive champagne ever to pass through my front door. The 2000 has been touted as one of the world's priciest champagnes and will cost around \u00a3670 in any restaurants or bars able to get an allocation when it goes on sale. So I was intrigued. Pen, glass and notebook in hand, I opened the 1999 as a reward for the two guests who arrived on time. We noted the typically pale, flaxen hue of this all-chardonnay champagne - not a particularly inviting colour, though it may become so if you begin to associate it with a delicious nectar. We sipped. And then we looked at each other. \"It's very soft,\" said one friend. She was right. Soft and gentle enough to star in an advert for fabric conditioner. The mousse was very fine, too - so much so that it created a mild sense of urgency and anxiety: quick, drink me before I die away. But the detail and depth were disappointing. It was nice, but not as nuanced as you would hope at this price - a wine that makes you shrug and wonder who would pay so much for it. The next two guests took a sip and rejected it altogether, requesting a glass of the \u00a320 fizz I had on hand instead. To be fair, the glass I gave them had been poured some time before, so may have gone a bit flat. I would have done better to serve another all-chardonnay champagne, M&amp;S's Orpale Grand Cru 1996 (\u00a334.99, reduced to \u00a329.99 until December 31), for which my far more excited tasting notes read, \"Very Christmassy, and lovely and toasty. Makes you feel festive and special. Not too blowsy.\" On the right are four more festive wines, designed to take you right through a seasonal dinner, from beginning to end. Emmanuel Delaille Cheverny Le Vieux Clos 2005, France Stockists \u00a35.49, down from \u00a35.99 when you buy two or more bottles, Majestic Description A useful blend of mainly sauvignon blanc with the balance chardonnay, with a close texture (lees-ageing adds some layers), surprising intensity for the price, and apple and citrus slicing across. Drink it with A good party or aperitif wine, because it's fresh but not screamily acidic. Or drink with smoked fish. Score 4/5 R\u00e9serve Perrin C\u00f4tes-du-Rh\u00f4ne Blanc 2004, France Stockists \u00a38.50, Roberson (Kensington High Street, London W14, 020...#8209;7371 2121) Description This rich blend of grenache blanc, bourboulenc, marsanne, roussanne and viognier has masses of flavour. It's a little peachy and tastes ripe. A very festive white. Drink it with We ate pears poached with cider and spices, and stilton p\u00e2t\u00e9 as a starter. Reverse the meal and serve it with stilton, fruit and fig roll if you prefer. Score 3/5 Nos Riqueza Ribera del Duero 2004, Spain Stockists \u00a39.99, M&amp;S Description A hefty, chewy, savoury, comforting tempranillo from one of Spain's leading wine regions that has had three months in new American and French oak. Drink it with I met one person who so loved this she drank it with a Thai green curry - 'I thought what the hell, it's so delicious.' Don't - roast beef, venison with spiced red cabbage or lamb leg is the thing. Score 4/5 Belvedere Pure Vodka Stockists From \u00a325.99, selected Waitrose, Selfridges, Harrods, Harvey Nichols, Fortnum &amp; Mason Description One of the softest-tasting vodkas you will find. No back-kick of dirt, just smoothness, so the alcohol nibbles rather than bites. Drink it with Put some shot glasses in the freezer, along with the bottle, so they frost, then serve with homemade cranberry sorbet. The astringency of the berries is good with vodka, and it's a better way of rounding off a heavy meal than sticky port.
