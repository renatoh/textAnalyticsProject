For his first promotional photoshoot in 1995, Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, wanted to be shot in front of symbols of wealth \u2013 expensive cars, buildings and yachts. When the photographer joked that he\u2019d one day have a yacht, Jay-Z responded: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt I will.\u201d His humble roots are traced in a new exhibition called Contact High: A Visual History of Hip-Hop, which features 140 photos of hip-hop culture from the 1970s to the present day, on view at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles until 18 August. It\u2019s a selection from a book of the same name, which traces the underground roots of hip-hop in New York to its global rise as a multimillion-dollar industry. \u201cTo see what hip-hop looked like, and not just sounded like, was really important,\u201d said the curator, Vikki Tobak. \u201cIt\u2019s the first of its kind ever mounted. There has never been an exhibition featuring the past 40 years of hip-hop. It started as an archiving project, then became a book, and is now up on the museum walls.\u201d The exhibition is divided into six chronological sections, from 1979 to 2019. Each section is named after an album or song, like Places and Spaces, the famous Donald Byrd jazz album, to Everyday People, the Sly and the Family Stone song reworked by Arrested Development as People Everyday, and California Love and beyond, named after the Tupac and Dr Dre track. It starts in 1979, when hip-hop was still a subculture, long before it hit the radio. \u201cIt was a music of everyday people \u2013 you had to go to the clubs to experience it,\u201d said Tobak. \u201cThey really felt for this culture, so photographers pointed their camera lens to this culture, which was yet to become what it is today.\u201d The exhibit showcases 60 photographers and features photos by Ricky Flores, who shot dancers in the South Bronx in the 1980s, and Joe Conzo, who pictured groups of on the streets of New York with their ghetto blasters. \u201cA lot of the photos are community shots with dancers, DJs and rappers, people in neighborhoods,\u201d said Tobak. \u201cYou see this evolution of stars coming out of that.\u201d Hip-hop has become a mainstream industry, but the exhibition traces how the genre\u2019s roots were based in resistance. Some images show Mos Def at a rally against police brutality in 1990s New York, others how rappers responded against racism during the trial of the Central Park 5. \u201cGroups like 2 Live Crew fought for free speech, for what you could and couldn\u2019t say on a record, which paved the way for free speech in hip-hop,\u201d said Tobak. \u201cGang Starr had a Malcolm X image on the cover of his Daily Operation album, speaking truth to power.\u201d Probably the most famous photo in the exhibition is Barron Claiborne\u2019s series of the Notorious BIG, the last photoshoot with the rapper, taken three days before his death in 1997. Wearing a crown, it commemorates the rapper\u2019s legacy. \u201cA lot of these photos are memorials for people who died too young,\u201d said Tobak. \u201cThere are photos of Tupac, Biggie, some in their 20s. It\u2019s a celebration but also a memorial.\u201d There are also photos in the exhibition of Nipsey Hussle, who was shot and killed in April. Since then, it has sparked peace talks among rival gangs in LA. \u201cThere have been truces,\u201d said Tobak. \u201cHis death affected the world and the ecosystem of LA very heavily.\u201d There\u2019s also a strong presence of female rappers in the exhibition, including Salt-N-Pepa \u2013 one of the first girl groups to rap about sex \u2013 photographed by Janette Beckman, who shot their cover shoot for Shake Your Thang in 1987. Beckman also shot a group photo for the Ladies of Hip Hop shoot for Paper magazine in 1988, a throwback to the foremothers of the era\u2019s true, original voice. There are backstage photos of Queen Latifah on set for her music video Fly Girl from 1991, taken by Al Pereira, who remembers her as a \u201cqueen in command\u201d. \u201cQueen Latifah is a queen; Lauryn Hill had a tomboy style in the 1990s; and Erykah Badu always had a regal look with her image,\u201d said Tobak. \u201cCardi B and Nicki Minaj have been added to the exhibit, too. What I was trying to get across is that there\u2019s no right way to be a woman in hip-hop, or in the world.\u201d The final section in the exhibition is called This is America, after Childish Gambino\u2019s Grammy-winning track, to show its global influence, but also its power in the country today. \u201cI want people to end there to understand hip-hop. It is America, our culture. It affects every facet from racial identity to corporate culture with streetwear and sneakers, right into the White House,\u201d said Tobak. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to show you how far it\u2019s come.\u201d Just as rap music has often been male-dominated, there have been homophobic and misogynistic slurs. But today, it\u2019s a more inclusive industry where mental health issues are talked about more freely, just as gay rappers have come out of the closet. \u201cTyler the Creator is in the show, and on his new album, he talks about mental wellbeing, which was rarely talked about before in hip-hop,\u201d she said. \u201cFrank Ocean came out. It\u2019s a positive. People ask if hip-hop is worse or better now, [but] there are things in the music today that haven\u2019t been talked about before. I\u2019m here for it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
