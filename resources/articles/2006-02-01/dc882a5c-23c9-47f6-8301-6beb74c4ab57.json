The idea, he explained, was about Albert Pierrepoint, Britain's last hangman. \"Are there any laughs?\" Harries asked. Well, no, said Mills, but it is a great story. He hanged over 400 people, including Nazi war criminals, before having to execute his best friend and then Ruth Ellis and then resigning. \"Is there at least a love interest?\" Harries begged. Yes, said Mills. \"But no laughs?\" Harries asked again. No, said Mills. No laughs. There was a pause. \"Right, well, go on then,\" said Harries. \"We'll do it.\" Harries was true to his word. Pierrepoint is released in April, starring Timothy Spall and Juliet Stevenson. It is a strange story for a film, but the route Mills took to creating it is almost as strange - although with fewer corpses, obviously. In the mid-90s he was a waggish face on both daytime and late-night TV. In Bed With Medinner, his LWT show mocking the lunacy of television, was hailed by lads' mags such as Loaded. As Danny Baker's cheeky replacement on Win, Lose or Draw he pulled in more than two million students and pensioners to open ITV's daytime schedule. He would spend weekends on stage at London's Comedy Store with the likes of Jo Brand and Lee Evans, then fly up to Scotland to welcome Lionel Blair and Little and Large into his gameshow studio. Not bad for a kid who left school early to join the merchant navy. As it was, his career in the merchant navy was brief - nine days to be precise. He left his Chester home and signed up in Liverpool, then headed to London where he failed to enjoy a minute of the basic training. \"The training college was a building in Gravesend High Street, but everything in it was fore and aft and if you wanted to go over the road to buy some sweets you had to ask 'permission to go ashore'.\" He sounds disbelieving even now. \"When I said I was leaving, the, um, 'captain' gave me this speech about the boys who'd stood where I was and said what I was saying who were even now sailing the seven seas. I said, I'm sorry, but I'm not one of them.\" Embarrassed about returning home so soon after the loving farewells, he decided to hang around in London. He got married, had two kids and was earning \"OK money\". He lived in Hackney and felt pretty content until a rare night out with his wife took them to the Market Tavern in Islington for one of 1983's \"alternative\" comedy nights. Not expecting much, they paid the unwaged entrance fee of \u00a31 and saw Mark Thomas and Mark Steel delivering blistering political stand-up. For Mills, it was a Damascene moment. \"I bored my wife senseless for the next few weeks, saying 'what about when he did this or that?', saying what I would have done and eventually, bless her, she said, 'well, why don't you do it then?' I had one strong political gag to open the set - which involved confusing 'for Reagan' with 'foraging' - and that would bring people to their feet cheering so I pretty much hit the ground running.\" Gradually Mills's stand-up evolved from the political into a quick, sarcastic and sometimes abrasive patter - although it had a core of beautiful silliness. One excerpt from In Bed With Medinner had him moaning at something in a cupboard for failing to do the washing up and take the rubbish out. The big reveal showed he was talking to a jar of Lazy Garlic. It was fun to watch, but if you were putting bets on who would be coming up with a movie script about a hangman, Mills would not be odds-on favourite. To be honest, he would struggle to rank as an outsider. But a mid-life crisis is a powerful thing. \"I hit 40 in 1997 and I started thinking about my life and realising that one day I'd be 50,\" he explains. \"I'd done things I was proud of. I was a good stand-up, but I wasn't a Jack Dee or a Frank Skinner. I could do chatshows, but not like Jonathan Ross or Michael Parkinson. I could host gameshows but I wasn't Bob Monkhouse. I wasn't the kind of person you'd find a format for. I was the kind of person on your list if you had a format and were looking for a jolly presenter.\" The crunch came when his agent told him he was on the shortlist to take over You've Been Framed. For a few weeks, he was walking on air. \"Then they told me they'd given it to the fat girl from Emmerdale. I'd been ridiculously excited and then crushed and I thought - is this what the next 10 years of my life is going to be like? Being on a list with Chris Evans and Vernon Kay and waiting by the phone?\" Almost overnight, he jacked it in and became a writer. With Jeff Pope, his producer on The Bob Mills Show - a kind of cross between a reality show and Larry Sanders - they pitched a script about the dark side of a gameshow host. It became Bob Martin, Michael Barrymore's acting debut. Although there were some concerns about Barrymore's drink problem - already well known in the industry - Mills insists he was a true professional during shooting. He turned up on time, did everything asked of him, never went home early and stood behind the camera giving other actors their lines. He was perfect to work with. \"But when he went home at night, you knew you didn't want to go with him,\" Mills says with a bleak smile. \"You knew that wherever he was going, it was a very, very dark place. And I can understand why. I saw the shooting script for My Kind of Music and it basically said 'Michael comes on and is funny with the audience.' That's going to drive you mad. But I think it was his vulnerability that drew people to him. I did warm-up for him at Teddington Studios and they had to open two whole studios to get the coach parties in. You wouldn't get that for Tarby or Brucie.\" He muses for a second. \"Of course, doing a second series of Bob Martin now would be incredible.\" Mills's transformation from cockney stand-up to serious writer seems almost complete. He and Pope wrote Stan the Man, a six-part comedy drama with John Thomson. That led to Northern Lights, the warmhearted ITV1 Robson Green vehicle vying for Monday night supremacy with BBC1's Life on Mars. Mills has also written for the current series of Shameless on Channel 4 - \"which is almost like a Bafta. They've been keeping an eye on your work and now you're ready to write for Shameless.\" These days, Hollywood's post-Desperate Housewives buzzword is \"dramedy\", coined to describe the slew of Wisteria Lane-like shows that mix big laughs with dark pauses, something Mills has been on to for almost seven years. \"I think I'm fascinated with obsession,\" he says. \"Bob Martin is about the obsession with fame that telly people have, and the cold fear that it will go. Northern Lights is about a man who's obsessed with bettering himself. Shameless is about how people with nothing are obsessed about what they have and Pierrepoint himself was obsessed - he wanted the executions to be the most efficient they could possibly be.\" The moment he fixed on Pierrepoint was when he heard an old radio interview where they asked him what it felt like to enter the condemned cell and take the prisoner to the gallows. \"I don't know,\" Pierrepoint replied. \"I never went into the cell. That was the official executioner's job.\" Mills realised that he had effectively operated under a dual personality - the husband and grocer Pierrepoint and the official executioner Pierrepoint. \"In a way, that's what it's like being a celebrity,\" he explains. \"When I was Medinner, people would come up to you and you'd realise they thought they were talking to someone who was utterly unlike you in every way. So you'd be that person for them and be yourself somewhere else. And that's a very dangerous route to go down. Because, ultimately, once you've done that it becomes easy to have your celebrity persona do unspeakable things. You could agree to do gameshows of the utmost cruelty because you'd think it wouldn't really be you. It's that kind of duality that's really interesting to me.\" And then, just for a minute, the cheeky cockney stand-up returns. \"Christ, listen to me,\" he laughs. \"I'm talking such a load of bollocks. Why didn't you stop me? You should have stopped me ages ago.\" Curriculum Vitae Age 49 Education 1968-1972 Chester City Grammar School Career 1972 Merchant navy 1973-1983 Hoffman Presser operator, driver and delivery man From 1983 Stand-up comic 1988 Presenter, Dial Midnight 1990-1995 Presenter, Win, Lose or Draw 1992-1996 Presenter, In Bed With Medinner 1993 Presenter, Games World 1997 Presenter, The Bob Mills Show 2000 - present Writer, Bob Martin, Northern Lights, Shameless and Pierrepoint"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
