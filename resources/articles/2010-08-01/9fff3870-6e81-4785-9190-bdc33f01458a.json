Such a scenario, in fact, is not the case. There are punters out there who, though doubtless sorry to hear about Harbinger's fractured cannon bone, have been left in an excellent position, while the bookies have little to laugh about. When he hacked up in the King George, Harbinger immediately stopped being a horse with a lot to prove at the highest level and became instead the hot favourite for any race in which he might run. Ladbrokes' David Williams told me yesterday that, as he watched the owners celebrate in the winners' enclosure, he priced the colt at 7-4 for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Two weeks later, when Harbinger crocked himself, he was still available at those odds and, according to Williams, there had not been nearly enough support to justify a shorter price. It might have seemed that Harbinger had only to turn up to win the Longchamp race but, as we have seen, it is dangerous to assume that a horse can stay healthy for two months. Punters know this and are not easily tempted by skinny odds for distant targets. If 7-4 was unattractive for the Arc, how much less so was the even money for next week's Juddmonte International, over a distance that Harbinger may have found on the short side. Williams said his firm had hardly laid a copper coin on the world's highest-rated racehorse for York, whereas they saw plenty of interest in other runners at bigger prices. They laid 8-1 and 7-1 about Twice Over, now cut to 3-1 in Harbinger's absence, giving a warm and fuzzy feeling to those who backed him before Saturday's news. \"Do you grumble and squeal when that happens? No,\" Williams says. \"Ante-post betting is not a revenue-driver so much as a shop window for the sport. It's rare to get extremely rich or extremely poor on a long-range market but they help to get people interested. The money you take would be small potatoes, compared to what you see in the last 10 minutes before the race starts, even for races like the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the Derby.\" Twice Over is widely reckoned to have been a bit unlucky when failing to catch Byword at Royal Ascot and Tuesday's International should be a fascinating rematch. I'd favour Byword, but I'll probably keep my hands in my pockets this time. The race I'm backing him for is the Arc, because 14-1 is too big. A spokesman for his owner, Khalid Abdullah, said this week that Byword was seen by Andr\u00e9 Fabre, the colt's trainer, as a mile-and-a-half horse at the end of last year. His Ascot win over 10 furlongs, when he shot clear and held on by a diminishing margin, might give the impression that he will have his stamina stretched by the Arc but he has other bits of form that suggest he should improve for the extra quarter-mile. His owner also has Workforce, a 10-1 shot, but the Derby winner has not even resumed fast work since flopping in the King George and it is a leap of faith to imagine he will be in peak condition for the Arc. Byword is a better bet and I'm taking the 14s now. If he runs to form on Tuesday and the Arc is then named as his definite target, those odds will be a distant memory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
