It was as if they were reluctant to stand at the very top of the group and the goals, from Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney, that have put them there did not materialise until the second half. A torpid England depended almost entirely on the Everton teenager to make the spectators tingle. Rooney's lack of experience was an asset since a game such as this still galvanises him, while others knew they were present only to meet some dull responsibilities. His imagination, technique and endeavour were a delight. Eriksson must now ponder how he can accommodate him in a side that may need a more conservative pattern as it searches for the point in Turkey on October 11 that will confirm England's place in Portugal. The coach, of course, will also wonder how he can afford to do without him. If Rooney had not been present against superbly stubborn visitors last night there would have been catcalls over the side's meagre display. Eriksson's eighth consecutive victory was achieved but this was not the carefully designed event that had been expected. The staging was perfect for the captain. Against the backdrop of his old side's stadium David Beckham's England were in the all-white strip of his new club. The scene was picturesque but the game was unwilling to follow the script. This had been intended to be a light comedy full of jolly goals. Within the first minute, though, there could have been a black farce. As Mario Frick ran straight towards the area members of the crowd were already trying to remember just how many seconds it had taken David Galtieri to score his goal for San Marino in 1993. Fame beckoned for Frick, too, since there was no effort to challenge him. Beckham was the nearest opponent but he knew that football was not supposed to be a contact sport for him since he and Steven Gerrard were ensuring they dodged the yellow card that would rule them out of the Turkey match. It turned out that Beckham could afford to maintain his distance as Frick lashed the ball high. During the first half there was no glut of chances to overwhelm that incident. While there is a limit to the progress a side such as Liechtenstein can make they have become expert at clinging on. England could not quite prise loose that grip before the interval. James Beattie came closest when, after 42 minutes, he took Beckham's cross on his chest and then lashed a drive off the bar. All the same Beattie never overwhelmed defenders and squandered the opportunity after being afforded a spot in the starting line-up. It was the 17-year-old Rooney, still exhilarated by his first goal for England at the weekend, who was regularly incisive. After purposeful interchanges with Wayne Bridge in the ninth minute Owen had a shot parried by Peter Jehle and the goalkeeper then had to back-pedal and touch over Rooney's header from the rebound. With Bridge and others fading later it was Rooney alone who would not flag. His clever run and cross after 19 minutes had Beckham brushing an attempt against the top of the bar. It was by rougher means that an even more blatant opportunity was devised. Beckham flighted the ball in and the referee saw no offence as Beattie bumped Jehle but Owen thumped the ball wide. Although Jehle was booked for dissent, Liechtenstein were generally content. It is no novelty for Eriksson's team to disappoint before the interval but few had supposed that the trait would be on view once more in a test of this elementary nature. Still, it would have been falsehood to suggest that England were in a state of distress. A full 90 minutes is an extraordinarily long period for a side such as Liechtenstein to endure. Plucky as they had been, they could survive for no more than 45 seconds after the restart. The move was so simple that one could only marvel that England had failed to complete such a build-up sooner. Gerrard crossed from the right and Owen found the net with a header to claim his 24th England goal. The crowd was warmed by the notion that a spree, after initial delay, might be in the offing. They were further encour aged in that mistaken belief after 52 minutes when Rooney, who had become England's youngest ever scorer in Skopje, again entered the record books, as the second youngest to notch a goal. Gerrard had claimed that the Everton forward would hit the net regularly now that he had broken his duck and the Liverpool midfielder helped bear out his own prophecy. His careful knock-down from a Beckham delivery created a showcase for Rooney's exquisite timing as the striker struck a first-time drive low past Jehle. The youngster was zestful all evening, setting up a chance for Owen seconds before he was replaced. Only substitution could stop Rooney.
