The England manager believes the Football Association is working to make \u201cthe boardroom more representative, and that is gender as well as race\u201d. But it is plain that there remains a long way to go and, with the Black Lives Matter movement prominent around the world, he feels it is a \u201cmoment for change\u201d. Southgate opened up as he considered the comments of Raheem Sterling, the Manchester City and England winger, from the beginning of the week. Sterling questioned why Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard had been given high-profile manager jobs after ending their playing careers whereas Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole had not, as he shone a light on the lack of BAME representation in positions of authority in the British game. Gerrard took over at Rangers after coaching in the Liverpool academy for a little over a year while Lampard, now at Chelsea, got the Derby job a year or so after his retirement. Campbell, who has managed Macclesfield and Southend, has repeatedly spoken out about the prejudices he has encountered in the fight for opportunity at the highest levels. Cole hung up his boots last August and is the Chelsea under-15s coach. \u201cI think Ashley Cole is developing very well and on a similar route to what Steven did \u2013 in that Steven worked in Liverpool\u2019s academy for a couple of years,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cOn a broader scale, we lack that representation. The biggest crime for us in any area if we\u2019re adults looking at kids is if they sit and think that a path in life isn\u2019t possible. And is not accessible. \u201cI heard Jermain Defoe say a few days ago: \u2018Is it worth me taking my [coaching] qualifications?\u2019 We have to avoid the feeling that you can\u2019t achieve something because that stops some people going for it. We have to make sure the opportunity is there when people are qualified and capable. And then, of course, they have to grasp that opportunity. If they can do well, they\u2019ll role model what\u2019s possible to the next generation.\u201d Southgate namechecked Justin Cochrane, the England under-16s coach, as \u201csomebody who is going to be a top coach\u201d. He said: \u201cWe also shouldn\u2019t look just at the ex-players or high-profile players because so many of the top managers haven\u2019t been top, top international players. That route must also be open to black coaches that haven\u2019t played at the highest level. There will be some super bright lads out there who have come through universities \u2013 they might go the route that a Graham Potter has taken by going back into university. We\u2019ve got to make sure that all of those pathways are open.\u201d Southgate admitted that he had become more aware of white privilege as he got older, having not noticed it during his playing days, when being selected or not was \u201cone of the few areas that was a meritocracy\u201d. He got his break in management at Middlesbrough in 2006, shortly after retiring as a player at the club, despite not having his Uefa Pro Licence. \u201cI know that I got an opportunity at Middlesbrough when I wasn\u2019t qualified,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThat came because I had worked at the club and the owner knew me. But I couldn\u2019t say that opportunity would have been there for somebody else. And I think we are all very conscious of it. \u201cThe power of what is happening at the moment is that people are standing together and these observations, these deeper-seated issues are rightly leading to the broader debate on opportunity, on privilege, and it\u2019s important people speak out. I do feel there is a moment for change but I\u2019m also conscious that we\u2019ve been here before. \u201cPeople have spoken brilliantly over the last week \u2013 people like Troy Townsend, Chris Grant and David Olusoga. A lot of that will be uncomfortable for white people, in particular, but they are critical voices to be heard. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to hear from white voices because ultimately they are going to be in the positions to open up opportunity. We are the ones who have to be educated.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
