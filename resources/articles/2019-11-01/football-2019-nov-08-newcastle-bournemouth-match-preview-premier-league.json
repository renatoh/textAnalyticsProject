Whatever the result, Bruce is highly unlikely to be dismissed but will nonetheless be happy when the impending international break is over. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say it but a lot of managers think \u2018I have to get past the international breaks\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIn October and November some of us think we\u2019ve got past that hurdle of getting the sack.\u201d Louise Taylor Saturday 3pm Venue St James\u2019 Park Last season Newcastle 2 Bournemouth 1 Referee Martin Atkinson This season G10 Y31 R1 3.2 cards/game Odds H 17-10 A 19-10 D 9-4 NEWCASTLE Subs from Darlow, Manquillo, Krafth, Dummett, Ki, Gayle, Carroll, Muto, M Longstaff, Atsu Doubtful None Injured Lejeuene (knee, 25 Nov), Sch\u00e4r (knee, 25 Nov), Ritchie (ankle, unknown) Suspended S Longstaff (second of three) Discipline Y18 R2 Form DLWLDW Leading scorer Shelvey 2 BOURNEMOUTH Subs from Boruc, Travers, Stacey, Ibe, Simpson, Francis, Kelly, Mepham, Gosling, Danjuma, Dobre, Solanke Doubtful None Injured Brooks (ankle, 23 Nov), Surman (knee, 23 Nov), Daniels (knee), Stanislas (knee, both unknown) Suspended Lerma (one match) Discipline Y24 R0 Form WDLDDW Leading scorer C Wilson 5"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
