Spurs have also approached Chelsea with a view to signing the England international Joe Cole, an inquiry that was not dismissed although Jose Mourinho is unlikely to allow the former West Ham player to depart before finding a suitable replacement. Tottenham's chances of signing Cole are hindered further by the midfielder's reluctance to leave Stamford Bridge. It is understood that the 22-year-old would, however, be willing to reconsider his position in the new year if first-team opportunities are limited under the new manager. That might not be soon enough for Spurs who are eager to replace Darren Anderton, Gustavo Poyet and Christian Ziege, all of whom departed at the end of last season. Tottenham's interest in Cole together with the acquisition of Davis supports their chairman Daniel Levy's claims that the club are keen to retain a strong British presence on the field despite the appointments of the former France manager Jacques Santini as head coach and Frank Arnesen as sporting director. Fulham were keen to retain Davis, but the 24-year-old declined a new contract at the end of last season and after Tottenham increased their initial bid of \u00a32m their London rivals reluctantly accepted. \"I am delighted we have been able to secure the signing of Sean Davis,\" said Arnesen. \"He is a very talented player who will have an important role to play in the centre of our midfield.\" As part of the \u00a37m Postiga exchange deal Porto were hoping to offload the Lithuanian forward Edgaras Jankauskas. However, Tottenham preferred to sign Mendes, a 25-year-old defensive midfielder, who made 10 appearances in the Champions League last term. The departure of Postiga, who headed Portugal's late equaliser against England in Lisbon last month, signals an end to a highly disappointing stay at Tottenham, during which the 21-year-old scored just one Premiership goal. Tottenham will receive \u00a35m for Postiga, \u00a31.25m less than Glenn Hoddle paid for the striker last year, while Mendes arrives at a cost of \u00a32m. \"There is no doubting Helder's ability but maybe he came to the Premiership too soon. He was keen to return home and, although we rate him highly here, we did not like to see him unhappy,\" said Arnesen. \"It is an excellent deal for us because Pedro gives us more options in midfield and brings with him experience in European competition.\" Tottenham have also approached the Denmark full-back Thomas Helveg and also inquired about Porto's Nuno Valente. Both players figured in Euro 2004 and while Valente would be expected to fill the void left by Ziege, Spurs' interest in Helveg will fuel speculation that the right-back Stephen Carr is poised for a switch to Newcastle. The Birmingham chairman David Gold believes the signing of the Dutch full-back Mario Melchiot is further proof that the club can now attract top-quality players after years of underachievement. The 27-year-old became a free agent when his contract with Chelsea expired at the start of the month. He becomes the fourth player to join Blues this summer following the arrivals of the England striker Emile Heskey, the Turkey midfielder Muzzy Izzet and the Crystal Palace winger Julian Gray."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
