All available evidence suggests disabled people who receive out of work benefits do want to work. It is absolutely right to focus on improving the employment rate of disabled people, but the answer is not ever-increasing conditions and penalties, it is more support and challenging entrenched negative attitudes among employers. Also, the debate often forgets one other crucial group: those least likely to return to work. If the political will existed, this current welfare reform programme could help this group out of poverty. Amid any tough-talking on benefits, it is imperative that this opportunity is not missed. Guy Parckar, public policy manager, Leonard Cheshire Disability The National Autistic Society is deeply concerned that people with autism are at risk of inappropriate compulsory work programmes and hefty sanctions, rather than getting the specialist support they need to succeed in the workplace. A too inflexible approach may only increase the stress and anxiety they are already under and could actually damage their employment prospects, while target-driven providers keen to get people into jobs may also ignore those with autism who might need more long-term assistance. Amanda Batten, head of policy and campaigns, the National Autistic Society Jobcentre Plus should be the most effective way of managing the process of a disabled person seeking work, but some disability employment advisers (DEAs) do not know how to deal with people with learning disabilities. One mother told us that her local DEA had said: \"I never place anyone with Down's syndrome because they all have a tendency to cuddle people.\" Many people with Down's syndrome are both capable and willing to work, but there is a missing link between them and the employers who would like to hire them. Unless this situation is resolved it is difficult to see how the government's drive towards \"employ ability\", no matter how well intentioned, will work. Carol Boys, chief executive, Down's Syndrome Association Homing instinct Your article hinted at a brave new dawn for local authorities considering building new council housing (Building up hope, August 13). With some of the highest housing needs in the country, we aren't waiting for the government to relax its funding formula or allow us to bid directly for social housing grant. In Islington, we've already started our first phase of homebuilding and have identified several other sites in the borough for much needed council housing. It's the first time in a generation we have built council homes from scratch, and shows how keen we are to go the extra mile to meet demand from a growing population. We see new council house building as the key to keeping families in the borough, extending opportunities to work and learn, and helping the regeneration of this inner-city London borough.
