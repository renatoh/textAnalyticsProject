The Guardian accepts that Mrs Peel is not, and was not, involved in the management, operations or control of NSO, an Israeli cyber intelligence company. Mrs Peel has a single digit percentage, indirect and passive interest in the regulated Novalpina Capital investment fund (\u201cthe fund\u201d) that acquired NSO in 2019. She acquired that stake well before the fund\u2019s acquisition of NSO. Novalpina Capital, as with many institutional private equity funds, has complex corporate entities and differing filing requirements in multiple jurisdictions. All allegations against NSO are unproven and remain contested by the company. Mrs Peel is not, and was not, personally involved in the operation or decisions of the fund, which is managed by her husband Stephen Peel, and others. Mrs Peel was not involved in any decision-making relating to the fund\u2019s acquisition of NSO. We are happy to clarify the position and apologise to Mrs Peel if anyone understood the article to mean otherwise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
