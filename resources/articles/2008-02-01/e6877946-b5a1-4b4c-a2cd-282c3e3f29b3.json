It's where some of the real forward strides are being made in terms of creating environments with depth and atmosphere. Sometimes it's the obvious stuff - the enthusiastically over-used high dynamic range lighting that hurt your eyes when you drove out of tunnels in Ridge Racer 7 and will make the sunburnt zombies even scarier in Resi 5. More subtle, perhaps, is dynamic luminosity - a technique that seeks to simulate the way light bounces off every reflective surface in a room. Global illumination in other words. At GDC next week, UK company Geomerics will be showing off the latest version of Enlighten, its dynamic luminosity engine, which creates the effect in real-time for PS3, Xbox 360 and PC developers. Geomerics has produced an interesting little video of the effect in action, which explains it all better than I can. The important thing about dynamic luminosity is that it subtly, almost imperceptibly, creates a coherent, plausible environment. Without it, you get a sort of scenic equivalent of the Uncanny Valley - everything seems flat and unreal. Crucially, characters moving through a scene don't quite look part of it unless the radiosity works. Geomerics' website has an admittedly partisan feature on the effect, which also claims that the reason we have so many shooters filled with dull greys and browns is that artists intentionally limit the pallet, \"so that the lack of colour bleeding from the world onto characters is not so keenly noticed\". So, more luminosity means less moribund, rust-hued shooters? Could it really be that easy?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
