Now they are to be given white lines. From October these will be drawn between the stumps at all international matches to help improve the officials' accuracy in judging leg-before decisions. The idea is to give umpires the same advantages as TV viewers, who are often equipped with virtual-reality carpets from wicket to wicket. The experiment has been adopted by the governing body, the International Cricket Council, in preference to turning to the TV umpire for advice on certain lbw decisions, particularly whether a ball has pitched outside leg stump. Bowlers will be irritated by the development because the lines will give batsmen a useful guide as to exactly where the ball pitches. One of the essentials of batsmanship - knowing the location of your off stump - is about to become blindingly obvious, at least against the spinners. \"We haven't decided whether to use an unbroken or dotted white line,\" said Dave Richardson, the ICC's cricket manager, \"but this is an experiment worth introducing.\" He also claimed, dubiously, that umpires make correct decisions in more than 90% of cases and that wholesale adoption of new technology would improve that accuracy by only about 3%. A further umpiring aid will be introduced, an earphone that will pick up sound effects from the stump microphone and which, the ICC hopes, will enable umpires to hear thin edges more easily. Technology has proved fallible, however, in determining the legality of low catches and it will be no longer used after this summer, apart from in cases when both umpires are unsighted. But it will be introduced to decide whether batsmen have been caught off a bump ball - when the ball is immediately hit into the ground - after studies convinced the ICC that technology could help in that respect. Responsibilities are increasingly being taken away from on-field umpires but, paradoxically, the ICC is considering increasing their number from two to three. The additional one would most likely be positioned to monitor no balls, leaving the umpire at the bowler's end to concentrate on watching the batsman. \"Other sports have a larger number of umpires who are occupied for a shorter length of time,\" said Mal Speed, the ICC's chief executive. \"We want to minimise mistakes.\" The proposals were discussed by chief executives at Lord's over the past two days but they have yet to be considered by the cricket committee or, indeed, by the international umpires' panel. A major review of Test and one-day programmes will also take place in response to gathering criticism that too much international cricket and too many one-sided contests are damaging the game. Bangladesh, perennial whipping boys since they were prematurely anointed as a Test nation, will receive special attention in the form of a new indoor school in Dhaka, specialist international coaches and the funding of an Under-19 coach. In the meantime their number of away series will be reduced. The two-Test visit to England in 2005 must now be in jeopardy. International cricket in the United States also moves inexorably closer. The sport plans to tap into the sizeable expat market with a series of triangular tournaments over the next three years, as long as financial projects are satisfactory and enough countries express a willingness to experiment. It looks inevitable that the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean will also include matches in the US. England's failure to curb pitch invasions by Pakistan supporters at Old Trafford on Tuesday has sparked ICC concerns about the staging of the Champions Trophy in September 2004. \"This is a serious issue,\" Speed said. \"At the South Africa World Cup not one person illegally came on to the playing arena. We cannot have players and officials subjected to danger. The ICC supports English cricket's calls for government legislation.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
