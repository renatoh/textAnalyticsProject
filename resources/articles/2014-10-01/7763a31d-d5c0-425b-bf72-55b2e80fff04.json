It comes here, in this dazzling bio-show about Ray Davies and the Kinks, when the faintly languorous title song is turned into a celebration of England\u2019s World Cup victory in 1966. As the song weaves its magic and red-white-and-blue petals cascade from the roof, the theatre is suddenly flooded with a sense of recollected happiness. As someone who cocked only half an ear to the Kinks in the 1960sand who missed the show\u2019s premiere at Hampstead in April, I was taken aback by the richness of the songs. But the ingenuity of Joe Penhall\u2019s book lies in the way it uses those songs to chart the ups-and-downs of four working-class boys from Muswell Hill who brought a new note of ironic wistfulness to English popular music. Even at their chirpiest, the songs contain an undertow of melancholic solitude. But Penhall also shows how the most delicate on-stage harmonies were accompanined by deep personal disharmonies, with Ray constantly at war with his madcap brother, Dave, or the band engaged in battles with exploitative middle-men or American unions. Edward Hall\u2019s joyous production neatly allows the songs to grow out of the story and the cast is first-rate. John Dagleish , who actually resembles an elongated John Lennon, perfectly captures Ray Davies\u2019s mix of bloody-mindnedness and innocence while George Maguire, swinging from a chandelier in a pink frock, embodies brother Dave\u2019s wildness. Lillie Flynn as Ray\u2019s wife, Rasa, and Philip Bird as an overpowering Allen Klein also impress in a versatile ensemble that zips easily between acting and playing instruments. At close to three hours, the show is on the long side but it offers a heady celebration of a quintessentially English talent. \u2022 Until 23 May 2015. Box office: 0844 871 7627.
