The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time by Mark Haddon put a massive smile on my face. My absolute highlight of the year is The Pillowman by Martin McDonagh at the National. I've seen it twice and plan on going again. A brilliant, spooky play that made me laugh, cry and jump out of my skin. Turkey: this year's Big Brother lost me as a fan. Russell T. Davies TV writer Great year for television drama, with State of Play and Prime Suspect. My own cultural revolution came about with Sky Plus, I bloody love it. Turkey: television news just gets thicker and thicker. On all channels, the war brought out a simple, jingoistic reportage. And by the end of the year, we've got ITN reporters telling us that to be with Ian Huntley is to be 'in the presence of evil'. Vital, complicated issues are being reduced to limericks for idiots. We should all be ashamed. Anne Reid Actress Scenes from the Big Picture by Owen McCafferty is a play about a day in the lives of 21 people living in Belfast - clearly drawn, rich characters, they're made even more interesting because we are never told what their religious or political affiliations are. It was brilliantly directed at the National Theatre by the great Peter Gill. A Play Without Words, also at the National, knocked me out of my socks. The choreography is stunning. A kaleidoscope of intricate shapes and patterns. It's dramatic with wonderful flashes of comedy. But the pinnacle was at the Festival Theatre, Chichester, where Desmond Olivier Dingle was reading his The Complete History of the Entire World and Shakespeare: The Truth. I laughed until I was in real pain. Turkey: I would like to stuff all those pseudo-eavesdropping actuality programmes on TV and put them in a very hot oven. Estelle Morris Minister for the Arts It's been a great year for Turner enthusiasts like myself, with shows in all three of the cities closest to my heart: Manchester, Birmingham and London. Turner: The Late Seascapes at the Manchester Art Gallery was wonderful. These are pictures to drink in - as powerful from a distance as they are close to. Some of the work has never been on show in this country, and it is a real privilege to see them at last, and in such impressive surroundings. Equally, Tate Britain's Turner and Venice was tremendous. The Hours is my film of the year. It is a jewel, beautifully structured and powerfully acted. The English National Ballet's Rite of Spring at Sadler's Wells was another triumph. I found the intensity and power of the dancers quite hypnotic, and a stunning complement to Stravinsky's music. Aaron Barshak Comic I thoroughly enjoyed the Titian exhibition (National Gallery). When you look at the vibrant blues and reds, you can see what the Hollywood studios aimed for with Technicolor. In Titian's Allegory of Time Governed by Prudence, it's as if Martin Scorsese has commissioned Titian to do the posters for Casino. At the Edinburgh Festival, nothing so impressed me and made me bellylaugh constantly as Reginald D. Hunter's White Woman show. It taught me that everybody has an id\u00e9e fixe about other groups of people and that even the most liberal of us can be racist and sexist. The most amazing art show I saw was when I attended Her Majesty's Prison Bullingdon. Charles Saatchi needs to buy the place; a triumph in Brit Art minimalism. I have never seen so many unmade beds under one roof. Turkey: the worst show I attended this year, was indeed my own Edinburgh premiere. Things got better as the run went on, but, according to age-old laws of chivalry, I, a commoner, who had touched a royal personage, had to die, and I did... frequently. Peter Conrad Author, critic The two performances I won't ever forget came from divas who respectively specialise in agony and ecstasy: Vanessa Redgrave strung out on morphine in the Broadway production of O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night, and the soprano Karita Mattila exposing both soul and body in her glorious, dangerous account of Strauss's Salome at the Paris Opera. The most eye-opening exhibition was Saved! at the Hayward Gallery, sampling the treasures added to our patrimony with some help from the National Art Collections Fund. Nicholas Hytner Director, National Theatre Two astonishingly inventive shows did things that were genuinely new to me: Simon McBurney's The Elephant Vanishes at the Barbican and Shunt's Dance Bear Dance under a railway arch in Bethnal Green. I was overwhelmed by a Royal Ballet revival of Kenneth MacMillan's Song of the Earth. Fernando Meirelles's City of God confirmed that South America is now home to the world's most exciting filmmakers. Turkey: I've directed too many turkeys of my own to want to point the finger at anyone else. John Simm Actor Glastonbury Festival was incredible this year. We arrived to torrential rain, the sun came out for Echo and the Bunnymen, and from then on, it was three days of joy. Radiohead were stunning, as were Primal Scream, but the highlight for me was The Coral. It was a great year for music, old and new. Missy Elliott, Dizzee Rascal and Blur all pushed things forward, while The Go-Betweens, The Coral, Outkast and The White Stripes all released truly special albums. City of God was the best film I saw this year, it had all the energy and passion of Scorsese's finest work. I also enjoyed \u00catre et avoir and Kill Bill Volume One. On TV I loved David Morrissey as Gordon Brown in The Deal and Chris Eccleston in Flesh and Blood. Michael Grandage Director, Donmar The Barbara Hepworth Centenary exhibition at Tate St Ives was stunning. Leanne Benjamin and Jonathan Cope were extraordinary in the ninth section of Christopher Wheeldon's glorious Polyphonia at the Royal Ballet. The diversity and energy of Nicholas Hytner's first season at the National has been wonderful for the theatre. Turkey: Never mind turkeys - in Finding Nemo, it was a joy to finally understand seagulls. Julie Kirkbride Shadow Arts Minister I particularly enjoyed Calendar Girls - the plain-speaking practicality of the story took me back to my own Yorkshire roots. Turkey: The biggest turkey of the year was undoubtedly David Blaine's 44-day starvation. He claimed that he had got into people's psyches, but I found the whole event a complete bore. Nicholas Wright Playwright High points: most of the shows and all the audiences at the National Theatre and the Young Vic. DeObia Oparei's deliciously toxic Crazyblackmuthafuckin'self in the Theatre Upstairs. Merce Cunningham at Tate Modern. Tarkovsky's Boris Godunov revived at the ROH. As for books, Master of the Senate, the third instalment of Robert Caro's superb L.B.J. biography. I enjoyed Andrew Wilson's Patricia Highsmith biography and Elizabeth Jane Howard's autobiography. Turkey: the concept of turkeys is repellent. Wes Butters Radio 1 DJ My event of the year was Love, Actually. I've always wanted to be in a film ever since I was a kid so imagine my surprise when one day I receive an email from Richard Curtis offering me a huge percentage of the box office if I made an appearance as myself. I thought I'd better take him up on the offer. It's a film that pushes all the right buttons. Turkey: The death of Richard Hillman in Coronation Street. Wouldn't it have been great if Hillman hadn't died, had been found not guilty and had gone back to terrorise the street? Stephen Woolley Film producer The production of The Pillowman at the Cottesloe; Martin McDonagh's play was astounding. The documentary \u00catre et avoir was wonderful. I also loved the book The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time by Mark Haddon. Turkey: The insufferably boring David Blaine in his glass box. David Lan Director, Young Vic The best theatre I saw was Luc Bondy's production of Anatol in Vienna. An exhilaratingly deep reading of it. Merce Cunningham in the midst of Tate Modern's Weather was the most astonishing event, while Peter Sellars's staging of an Artaud monologue at the same address was the most soporific. Manu Chao were played constantly driving into work and Michael Connelly's series of Harry Bosch crime novels proved effective at making the world go away. Colin Murray Radio One DJ The Darkness. I reckon that covers music, performance, art, comedy and genius. When we first started playing 'Get Your Hands Off My Woman' on Radio 1, the response was shock and awe. Thumbs up, rock on. Turkey: Elton John being cool again. Stewart Lee Writer-director, Jerry Springer - The Opera The best thing I saw this year was the Czech violinist, singer, composer and improviser Iva Bittova solo at St Luke's, Old Street. She came out, stalked the aisles, stared us out, screeched, scraped and soared in a performance that made me laugh, cry, tremble and then clap my hands off. Turkey: The worst thing I saw was the Daredevil movie. There are plastic Daredevil action figures with more charisma than Ben Affleck. Alexei Sayle Comedian and novelist My cultural highlight was the anti-war demo. As the son of communists, my teenage years gave me an aversion to going on demonstrations. There's nothing a young man wants more than to be seen by all the cool kids walking down the road with a load of old loonies shouting about peace. Yet I have attended every anti-war demo this year and felt enthusiasm and hope. Turkey: The fake one Bush pretended to serve to the troops on Thanksgiving Day on his 11-minute visit to Iraq. Nothing symbolises the fraudulent, manipulative way the invasion was promoted more than that rubber bird. Tim Firth Writer, Calendar Girls and the musical Our House The Liverpool Philharmonic Children's Concert season for their unpatronising irreverence - particularly the bloke who played 'The Flight Of The Bumble Bee' dressed as the Grim Reaper. The year would have been much duller without Cobblestone Runway by Ron Sexsmith, who looks 15, sounds 50 and writes heartbreaking melodies with unfashionably optimistic lyrics. Watching Gypsy on Broadway was an object lesson in musical book-writing. The movie highlight was the Loach-esque street-child assassination scene in Meirelles's City of God. Turkey: Martin Bashir. Beware the documentary maker who starts to use the word 'I' too much. Tony Clark Artistic director, Hampstead Theatre Two new plays have stayed with me: Darwin in Malibu - Crispin Whittell's witty comedy, and Roy Williams's Fallout. Taking the children to Olafur Eliasson's installation at Tate Modern was joyful and serene. Turkey: Perhaps people could stop marking artistic enterprise with stars in 2004?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
