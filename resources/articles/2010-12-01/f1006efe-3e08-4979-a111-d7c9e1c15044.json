Their strength has always been their often improvised, wildly varied and constantly surprising playing, with guitarist Kris Drever, fiddler Aidan O'Rourke and accordion player Martin Green constantly swapping solos in their intricately constructed compositions. Drever is also an impressive singer, equally at ease here with his own material, other peoples' songs and one traditional piece, Unquiet Grave, reworked in suitably dramatic Lau style. It's an approach that has brought them deserved success (they have won best group at the BBC folk awards for three years running), and they sounded even more inventive and enthusiastic playing live than on record. The trio came on in black shirts and jeans, then perched on stools as they explained how the landscapes of East Anglia or Scotland had inspired their work. They performed with even greater attack than in the past, switching from furiously upbeat jigs and reels to passages of sudden quiet, and moving between delicate guitar themes, elegant fiddle work and furious accordion playing on compositions such as Horizontigo and Gallowhill. These pieces are a regular part of their repertoire, but still managed to sound refreshingly original. Two new songs came from an EP that Lau recorded earlier this year with the Scottish singer Karine Polwart, but with Drever now handling the vocals. Evergreen was a sturdy, drifting ballad, while the cheerfully erotic Midnight Feast, written by the late Lal Waterson, was first given a thoughtful but up-beat treatment, then suddenly slowed down for a gentle fiddle passage before ending as a furious dance celebration. This was Lau at their very best."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
