Sure, the crowds are down but the idea is not about drawing live crowds, it is about getting big TV ratings. And that is exactly what Nine got last week with the Bunnies-Broncos clash being the highest rated show in Sydney on Thursday. It was a huge boon. Monday night has also been in the gun after some poor crowds but those firing the shots are missing the point completely with Monday\u2019s Panthers-Cowboys clash nearly doubling the second-rated show. Thursday and Monday aren\u2019t traditional footy nights but they do rate and they do give the NRL a free crack against other codes so hold plenty of value to the game. There will be plenty tuning into the Dogs-Tigers on Thursday, even if both teams are going like the proverbial busteds. And any footy fan with a Foxtel subscription will be hanging for an epic Monday Night clash between top-eight teams Melbourne and Penrith. Five nights of footy \u2026 we are only two short of getting it completely right. 2) Do or die The hour has arrived for those teams on the fringe of the eight to win. For those on the outside looking in, a defeat this week will likely end their finals charge. Parramatta can taste a miracle finals berth but if they can\u2019t rock Manly on Friday then their season, with such a cringeworthy differential, is as good as over despite a kind last two rounds. The Broncos can\u2019t make it without three straight wins and Anthony Griffin must start with a win over the man who pinched his job with Wayne Bennett and the in-form Knights heading to Brisbane on Saturday night. The Dragons are long odds but can put themselves in the mix with a big win over the Titans. September footy is something special but the run-in during August is just as thrilling, just as nerve-wracking, just as desperate, just as hopeful. 3) Don\u2019t get burned Two of the hottest sides in the NRL go at it on Saturday night at ANZ with South Sydney hosting North Queensland. The Bunnies have been near-unstoppable since Luke Keary assumed the No6 jersey. Souths have won five straight with no team getting within 16 points of the premiership favourites, Keary giving Michael Maguire\u2019s team a penetrating attacking wrinkle that the club has been sorely lacking in title tilts over the last two years. North Queensland have been nearly as dominant, winning four on end before suffering a heartbreaking loss on Monday against Penrith. Both the Rabbitohs and Cowboys are front and centre in the premiership picture and can make a big statement on Saturday night. 4) Another second generation star arrives One of the most highly rated prospects in the NRL is set to make his top grade debut on Sunday afternoon with Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson naming Jackson Hastings \u2013 son of Tricolours great and three-time Dally M Medal winner Kevin \u2013 to make his debut against the Warriors. A skilful half, Hastings will debut off the bench and likely play as a backup hooker. The NRL is littered with second generation stars \u2013 from Jarryd Hayne, Daniel Mortimer, Mitchell Pearce, the Morris twins and Will Hopoate \u2013 helping knit the past with the future in the great game. Keep an eye out for Hastings, an amazing talent who has a bright future ahead of him. He may even prove as good as his father, an underrated star of his generation. 5) An end in sight for the Asada saga? Once again the ugly, contorted, contrived and at-time malicious investigation that has dragged on for 18 months will again be at the forefront of footy talk with Cronulla this week issued show-cause notices and the prospect of cutting a deal that will wipe five Sharks players including skipper Paul Gallen out for the rest of the year on the table. The NRL should be applauded for sticking by the Sharks and regardless of what option the players take, there won\u2019t be too many fans of the game who will give them much grief. The day of reckoning has supposedly been coming for a long time and we still have very little to show for all Asada\u2019s bluster. For the most part, it has been much ado about nothing with little evidence of intent out there. The quicker this investigation is put to bed, the better it will be for all concerned. Footy fans are sick to death of Asada."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
