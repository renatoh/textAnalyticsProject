The motivations of the executives behind the recent approaches at the bookshop Ottakar's, the chocolate firm Thorntons and the discount retailer Peacock are not yet known. But the endgame is likely to be the same: a company in private hands. Finding backers does not seem to be a problem. In fact, retail companies seem to have more problems keeping venture capitalists away. The way to get in the door seems to be to convince the management to consider a buyout. In the gossipy world of retailing, it does not take venture capitalists long to establish those management teams which might be receptive to an approach. However, any attempt to take a business private needs the backing of City investors, who are often suspicious about buyout deals for fear that management teams are buying on the cheap. Lord Kirkham became the poster boy for this criticism in the early days of his bid. He won investors round eventually, though. Many other retailers have gone private, although not necessarily through a management buyout. Notable deals include Philip Green's takeover of Arcadia; Selfridges, and Debenhams. After those larger deals went though, many retail experts thought the private equity cash might dry up. But now retail experts seem increasingly willing to argue that retail groups are well-suited to private hands. Freed from the pressures of the stock market, retailers can make rapid returns by generating cash to pay down the debt used to finance the deal, the argument runs. Cynics are quick to point out that executives in the private equity arena are likely to be lining their pockets more deeply than in the public sector - and do not have to reveal their packages. The latest announcements have encouraged analysts to play spot the next candidate. Rhys Williams of Seymour Pierce points to Alexon and French Connection. At Numis, though, Steve Davies warns that approaches from venture capitalists do not always come to anything, best illustrated by Peacock in March - just 24 hours after admitting to talks it revealed that its suitor had gone. It has happened to bigger firms too. Woolworths and WH Smith are still listed in spite of private equity approaches. It remains to be seen whether the Peacock, Thorntons and Ottakar's approaches will prove as successful as Lord Kirkham's."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
