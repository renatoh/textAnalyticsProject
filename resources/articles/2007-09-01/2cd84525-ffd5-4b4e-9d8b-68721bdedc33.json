This victory, achieved more comfortably than the score suggests, restored them to third place in the Premier League where they lie three points adrift of the leaders, Celtic. Craig Levein, United's manager, has seen his side benefit from a favourable run of fixtures to begin the campaign but this is, without question, the most coherent and stable side the 1987 Uefa Cup finalists have had for years. Levein, moreover, has experience of keeping teams within touching distance of the Old Firm having taken Hearts to successive third-place finishes during his tenure at Tynecastle. Finally, having bestowed millions of his personal fortune on the club he has followed since childhood, the United owner, Eddie Thompson, is within touching distance of some tangible reward for his troubles. Victory against Gretna on Saturday would, temporarily at least, ensure they are jointly at the top of the table, with Rangers and Celtic idle until a day later. \"That's not something I'm getting excited about,\" insisted Levein. \"We have still to play the Old Firm, plus Hearts away. I'll be more comfortable speaking about the league position after the first round of games have been completed.\" But for a dubious refereeing decision at Kilmarnock on August 13, when United had Christian Kalvenes sent off when a goal in front and went on to lose 2-1, their situation would represent even more cause for celebration among tangerine-clad fans. For St Mirren this was another miserable afternoon, two weeks after a 5-1 humbling at the hands of Celtic. They lacked guile and, on too many occasions, discipline. Franco Miranda's dismissal only seconds before United claimed their second goal supplied proof of the latter - he had already been booked for a late lunge on Noel Hunt by the time the hosts took a 38th-minute lead. Hunt displayed a rare touch of composure in an otherwise scrappy first half to round Chris Smith in the St Mirren goal after the ball had broken into his path off Miranda. St Mirren offered precious little in reply, enjoying a brief spell of territorial dominance at the start of the second period but unable to create any meaningful opportunities. United displayed no such inadequacy, doubling their advantage when Jordan Robertson, a striker on loan from Sheffield United, cleverly flicked the ball beyond Smith after a low cross from Steven Robb. Miranda had by then been sent off after receiving a second booking for tripping Barry Robson. Hunt, who enjoyed an otherwise outstanding afternoon, subsequently blasted over when sent clean through on goal, and Robb struck woodwork twice. St Mirren, whose league status will be secured if Inverness Caledonian Thistle or Gretna continue their seasons in the dreadful manner in which they have started, were left chasing shadows in the Tayside sunshine. There was considerably more cheer, though, for United and their charismatic Polish goalkeeper, Grzegorz Szamotulski, who has now created a club record of five clean sheets from six league matches, surpassing the efforts of Billy Thompson in 1986.
