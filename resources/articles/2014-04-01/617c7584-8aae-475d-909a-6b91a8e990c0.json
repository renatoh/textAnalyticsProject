Nationwide, which says it is \"an idea whose time has come\", will become a principle partner in the scheme, meaning it will pay staff and contractors at its 700 branches the living wage of \u00a37.65 an hour and take a leading role in the effort to persuade other organisations to follow suit. The decision is a major boost for the campaign. The director of the Living Wage Foundation, Rhys Moore, said: \"We are delighted to welcome Nationwide to the Living Wage movement as both principal partners of the Living Wage Foundation and accredited employers. As the UK's largest building society, this move brings the living wage to high streets across the country, and showcases that the best employers are voluntarily signing up to pay the living wage now.\" More than 650 organisations and businesses are accredited as living wage employers, including KPMG and Transport for London, but campaigners say the Nationwide is the first high street brand to sign up. Since 2001 it has boosted the incomes of tens of thousands employees and put more than \u00a3210m into the pockets of some of the lowest-paid workers in the UK. The head of citizenship at Nationwide, Stephen Uden, said the decision to join the campaign fitted in with the organisation's guiding ethos as a mutual, adding that as the economy showed signs of picking up he hoped other major organisations would do the same. He said: \"In lots of companies there are those almost invisible staff who serve you a coffee in the morning or the cleaner I see when I get into the office at 7am. And it is those people that work for the Nationwide that we feel should be appropriately rewarded whether they are directly working for us or not.\" A study released by Nationwide and the Living Wage Foundation on Thursday to coincide with the announcement found that 85% of people think companies who can afford to should sign up to pay the living wage. Uden said Nationwide would be taking a leadership role in the campaign and would be trying to roll out the initiative across the UK's business community. He said: \"We will sit on the advisory council and help advise and steer where the campaign goes next, and also want to say to UK plc this is an idea whose time has come. Fair pay is something that clearly the majority of the public sign up to, something we sign up to, something our members sign up to, so as times get a little better economically take a look at it and see if you can do it too.\" About one in five workers in the UK earn less than the living wage, according to a survey carried out for KPMG in 2012, the second highest rate of low-paid workers in the OECD group of rich countries. Friday's study found that when asked what three things they would spend an additional \u00a3148.07 a month on \u2013 the difference between the living wage and the national minimum wage of \u00a36.31 \u2013 most people said they would use it to cover basics such as food and household bills. Campaigners say this supports claims that raising the pay of the worst off will not only reduce inequality but boost overall economic growth as a large proportion of the money is put straight back into the economy. According to research carried out for the Greater London authority, the living wage also has hard-nosed benefits for business: 75% of employees reported an increase in the quality of their work after receiving the living wage, with 80% of employers noticing an increase in productivity. Uden said: \"There is strong evidence of a wider benefit. People feel more comfortable doing business with organisations that they trust and who pay a fair wage to their staff. For us it was a decision driven from a values perspective but in terms of selling it to other businesses there are some clear business benefits that derive from it that people should not underestimate.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
