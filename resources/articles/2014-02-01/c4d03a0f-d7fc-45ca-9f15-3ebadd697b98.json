He has a parallel feud with Manuel Pellegrini of Manchester City. That, along with endless managerial complaints that referees are chronically biased against them, is standard managerial practice nowadays in the mega-mouth, mega-money, mega-ego world of big British football. Meanwhile, in the midst of this charmless cacophony, the news comes from Preston, where he'd lived all his life (playing for no other club) of the death of a mega-talented England footballer who, after he came back from the war, kept up the day job as a plumber even through his international days, never simulated injury, never badmouthed a referee and certainly never considered a Rooney-esque weekly wage of \u00a3300,000. Tom Finney embodied a saner age."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
