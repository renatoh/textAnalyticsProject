There was particular concern about the suggestion that people could be deported to countries that practice torture and Mr Blair's veiled threat to amend the Human Rights Act if the courts get in the way. Roger Smith, director of Justice, said: \"A British court would never accept a diplomatic assurance from a country that tortures its own citizens. Any attempt to amend the Human Rights Act to force courts to do otherwise is doomed to failure. A free society doesn't fight terrorists by exporting them to other countries. It prosecutes them here in the UK.\" Alex Bailin, a barrister specialising in human rights law at Matrix chambers, and who was part of Liberty's legal team in the Belmarsh detainees case last year, said article 3 of the European convention on human rights was an absolute prohibition against torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. \"It is not possible to derogate from it even in a public emergency threatening the life of the nation,\" he said. \"The only legal option, theoretically, would be for the UK to de-ratify the whole convention. That would involve us legally withdrawing from Europe as respect for the convention is a condition of membership of the Council of Europe.\" Mr Bailin said there was no strict legal bar to relying on diplomatic assurances from foreign countries receiving deportees that they would not be ill-treated. But he added: \"Because of the clandestine way in which torture is usually practised, often by rogue officials ... the assurances are almost impossible to verify or monitor. Hence the courts have generally taken a much stricter view of such assurances than the government.\" The human rights lawyer Louise Christian, who has defended high-profile terror suspects, warned about alienating young Muslims and criticised the proposal to proscribe the non-violent Islamist group Hibz ut-Tahrir. She said: \"History shows that compulsion and legislation is not the way to eradicate religious extremism. Deporting long-term residents to countries which practise torture is also likely to outrage and upset Muslims.\" Mr Blair pointed to France and Spain as countries where courts accept assurances from third countries. But Ms Christian said they had much more illiberal asylum systems than the UK. \"France and Spain may have been more active in stopping those who are claimed to be extremists getting there or in deporting them before they get the right to remain. But that is different to deporting people who have the right to remain and have been here a very long time.\" Tony Bunyon of Statewatch, the civil liberties group, also highlighted the problems with deporting people if they were associated with \"extremist\" websites, bookshops or organisations. \"The concept of what will become a crime seems to be slipping dangerously from the already contentious concept of 'indirect incitement', proposed by the home secretary, to 'justifying or validating' the use of violence. Does this mean that anyone seeking to understand - without condoning - the use of violence will be classed as 'justifying or validating' it? If so, it would constitute a major threat to the freedom of expression and the freedom of the press.\" Solicitor Geoffrey Bindman, who has taken the cases of Britons allegedly tortured in Saudi Arabia, pointed out that the home secretary already had the power to deport non-citizens where their presence in Britain is deemed \"not conducive to the public good. It is no great departure to use these powers to remove people who incite violence but it should not be used to inhibit the expression of opinions\", he said. The prime minister made it clear yesterday that his proposals were \"preliminary assessments\" and that urgent consultation was needed. But he has laid the foundation for a raft of legal challenges and confrontations with judges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
