Take part in a Guardian video project", "bodyText": "Readers are consuming news in record numbers at the moment, for obvious reasons. But they do so in very different ways, whether via a click of a mouse, a swipe of a screen or the long-beloved art of unfolding a newspaper. We\u2019re curious to see what the experience is like for people during the coronavirus pandemic and particularly what role the Guardian is playing in your daily life right now. So we\u2019re asking you, our readers, to film moments from your day during which you read, listen to or watch Guardian journalism. A selection of your contributions will make it into a video that we plan to publish online. Whether you subscribe to one of our podcasts or newsletters, or prefer to read our updates on platforms such as Instagram, we\u2019d love to hear from you. All you need to take part is a smartphone with a camera. All set? Read on... How to take part Step 1: film your routine Hold your camera or ask a family member to film you in landscape mode Show us one or more moments in your day where you\u2019re catching up on the news (eg listening to the Today in Focus podcast while making breakfast, scrolling through the Guardian app on your phone, watching one of our videos on YouTube) Film both your surroundings and yourself (looking into camera) so that we get the full picture of the scene Talk us through your routine: what\u2019s your preferred way of catching up on the news and why? How does it impact your day/life? Details are good: is there a particular article or piece of information you read that you found interesting. Maybe you shared a story with friends or family or vice versa? Maybe following the news is vital for your work. Sharing details makes your story unique to you. Feel free to be spontaneous and move your camera around as if you were speaking to a friend on FaceTime or WhatsApp. Step 2: send us your videos Please share your files with us by Sunday 19 April via email or WhatsApp: Email: instagramstories@theguardian.com WhatsApp: +44 7827 991466 Make sure you include \u2018My news routine\u2019 in the subject line Please also include your name and location If your files are too big to attach to an email, you can send them to the above email address via WeTransfer or Dropbox We look forward to receiving your videos!
