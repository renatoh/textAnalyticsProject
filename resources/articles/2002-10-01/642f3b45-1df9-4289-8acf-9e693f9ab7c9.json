A 24-year-old Frenchman, Jean-Marie Gonthier, has complained that he suffered a serious injury which has caused him to take time off work. It is the latest in a series of off-the-field incidents which have marred matches between French and Welsh clubs since European competitions began seven years ago. Bridgend refused to comment last night and said they had not heard from police in Pau but players privately admitted that a fracas had broken out after one of their number had performed a drunken strip-tease. The police were not called to the incident and the Bridgend contingent were allowed to stay on the premises. The Bridgend player concerned was warned about his future behaviour by the club on Monday after admitting being drunk in public but officials, preparing for the return match at the Brewery Field this Saturday, accepted his claim that he had not started a fight. One said: \"This seems to be an attempt to get some money in the form of damages but all we have heard so far is a number of conflicting reports. \"Nobody from the French police has been in touch with us and with the witnesses we have spoken to we are satisfied that no one from the club has a case to answer.\" Brive and Pontypridd players were involved in a bar-room brawl four years ago and were punished by European Rugby Cup Ltd. Pontypridd later had trouble in Colomiers and Llanelli and Pau were fined after a violent match in France. The Glasgow prop David Hilton yesterday became the second victim of the Grannygate saga, which blew up two years ago, to be readmitted into the international fold when he was named in the 41-strong Scotland squad to prepare for the 2003 World Cup. The 32-year-old had won 41 caps when it was discovered that his grandfather had not been born in Edinburgh as the player had believed but in Bristol, making him ineligible to play for Scotland. The New Zealand-born Brett Sinkinson resumed his Wales career last year after qualifying on residency grounds, the stepping stone used by Hilton yesterday following his move from Bath to Glasgow three years ago. \u00b7 The Harlequins flanker Pat Sanderson will be out of action until the new year after damaging knee ligaments during Saturday's Parker Pen Challenge Cup win over Caerphilly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
