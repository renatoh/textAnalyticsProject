There he crosses paths with Jack (Oscar Isaac), a dodgy-looking drifter full of smart-aleck patter, cheeky biblical references and Shakespeare quotations. Things do not go well, and when Jack catches Thomas making a fatal mistake, the latter finds he has a crafty new stalker, who then follows him home. Underneath the almost defiantly lazy thriller mechanics, this is more of a satire of Tinseltown mores, where it\u2019s impossible to tell, as Jack asks at one point, who\u2019s the bad guy since both leads are equally loathsome in different ways. That in itself is pleasantly subversive, given our collective fixation on \u201clikable\u201d protagonists, and it\u2019s not hard to see parallels with writer-director William Monahan\u2019s award-winning screenplay for The Departed. Isaac is charming and bonhomous as ever, Hedlund is suitably brooding yet dim looking, and Mark Wahlberg is a hoot as a chippy producer perpetually playing host to bored prostitutes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
