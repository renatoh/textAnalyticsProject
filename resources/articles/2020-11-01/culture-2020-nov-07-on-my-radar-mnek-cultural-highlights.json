He began his career at 16, working with the Saturdays and the Wanted at pop production house Xenomania; in the next few years, he went on to work with Kylie Minogue, Madonna and Beyonc\u00e9. After top 10 hits with Zara Larrson, Gorgon City and Stormzy, he achieved his first No 1 this summer, Head &amp; Heart, with Joel Corry (it stayed there for six weeks). His new track, More Than Words, with emerging artist Sleepwalkrs, is out now. 1. Film Rocks (dir Sarah Gavron) I\u2019m always appreciative of great black British films. I watched this recently at home on Netflix, about a young black girl whose mother abandoned her and her little brother. She\u2019s grappling with becoming a young adult, but also being a teenager at school. You never see that black British secondary school experience in movies \u2013 it\u2019s always classes of white kids. I grew up in suburban south London and being around similarly amazing, empowering, lively girls of colour was an everyday experience. Seeing that on screen was beautiful. It took me back 10 years. 2. Music Ivorian Doll Ivorian Doll has the chops to be the best British rapper out there. A few months ago, she did this show at the rap and grime Rated awards with another rapper, Br3nya. They did it in a way never seen done by British female rap before \u2013 they\u2019re really going for it and giving people a show. It wasn\u2019t a stuffy awards ceremony with people in suits, either \u2013 it was two girls in their own separate sets in different places, patched together, but giving it everything. Ivorian Doll performed her song Bodybag in a cemetery set, dancing around gravestones, and dropping in a segment of Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller. Lockdown has obviously prohibited physical performance, but it\u2019s made artists work harder with their visuals, and be exactly who they are, and gain lots of new fans in the process. 3. Audiobook The Meaning of Mariah Carey My printed copy of this got stolen from the porch of the flat I lived in \u2013 Amazon sent me a picture of it having been delivered, then it vanished! Listening to it as an audiobook was better, though, because it\u2019s Mariah telling her own story. At points, it was so poignant, especially listening to her talking about her experiences as a biracial woman who was passing as white and how that affected her career. Hearing about her secret grunge band in the mid-1990s was so interesting too. At the peak of her game, she still wanted to do something weird! I found that very inspiring. 4. Social media #endsars on Twitter Social media has been my best school in recent months. I\u2019ve been following the #endsars hashtag [following the series of mass protests against police brutality in Nigeria] constantly on Twitter. I\u2019m British-Nigerian, raised in the UK, but being able to see how corrupt the police are out there, and how they have treated young people, has really affected me. This year\u2019s been so heavy on all of us, but as far as people of colour and LGBT and trans people go, it feels like there\u2019s been so much more disenfranchising. It\u2019s crazy that it\u2019s been exacerbated during this horrible time and I feel it would be remiss of me not to mention it as part of my cultural life. 5. Food Korean fried chicken In the first lockdown, I knew I\u2019d be spending a lot of time at home, so I thought I\u2019d better get into something new. I\u2019m the kind of person who gets Korean fried chicken on Deliveroo once or twice a week, so I decided to learn how to make it instead, finding recipes online and going to the Asian supermarket near where I live to get the right ingredients. Cooking is so therapeutic \u2013 something comes out of this focused time that you can share with people you love. 6. Technology Zoom I wasn\u2019t aware of Zoom before the pandemic, like so many other people, but I\u2019ve found ways of collaborating through it musically. There\u2019s no comparable feeling to being in a room with someone, but I recorded Head &amp; Heart remotely with Joel [Corry], and I\u2019ve also been working with Mabel and Becky Hill. Working online reinterprets creativity \u2013 it makes you inventive with the creative process when you have to work with limitations. It also cuts the fat of \u201cHow was your day?\u201d and focuses the mind. You\u2019re suddenly: \u201cAre we going to make a song today or not?!\u201d And then you do!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
