One year it was Jared Leto, another, a pre-harness Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. In a sea of perfectly tailored black tuxes, this actor stands out, almost too much. He is basically saying: \u201cHey, listen up. I\u2019m not like those other guys for whom this is a visual Bond audition. I\u2019m special! I\u2019m caring, sharing and can play quirky (depending on the fee). Please cast me in your next John Green adaptation.\u201d Wearing white always feels like an audacious move: bold, carefree and maybe a little brash. Because who really wants to be That Guy? It doesn\u2019t have to be a white suit at the Oscars: what to make of the dude who turns up at the house party in all white? Or the friend of a friend in white quarter-length shorts and matching polo shirt? It either says try-hard, estate agent or Wham! tribute act. On the catwalk, white featured heavily in the shows of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons\u2019 Junya Watanabe. Today I\u2019m wearing a high-street take on that look: a souffl\u00e9 of white-on-white-on-white action from top to toe. I\u2019m blinded by my own clothes. Look at me, I think, I feel special now, too! I could be in a boy band (the one who just points and doesn\u2019t sing). I could be a superhero (Mr Muscle, the later years), I could be... an angel? One thing I\u2019m definitely not is someone who leaves the confines of the photographic studio. Because, unless you\u2019re a Love Island contestant (I\u2019ve never seen so many pairs of tight white jeans), these clothes can\u2019t exist in the real world; the real world of pollution, mud, red wine and children. You might try a splash of bright somewhere: a box-fresh trainer, say, or a crisp shirt to offset your normal jeans. But an all\u2011white outfit? Only if you\u2019re walking down a red carpet or a catwalk. User-friendly, this is not. But it\u2019s fun for a very excellent minute. \u2022 Priya wears coat, \u00a3180, by Nike, from mrporter.com.
