His achievements have been rewarded with a lucrative new contract that will keep him at Portman Road until 2006. Under Burley's astute management Ipswich have exceeded all expectations this season, avoiding an instant return to the First Division in such style that they are guaranteed a Uefa Cup spot and could finish in the top three. The Ipswich chairman David Sheepshanks said the five-year deal put Burley \"among the top echelons of football managers in England\" and was a \"measure of our belief in his talents\". Burley will earn around \u00a3500,000 a year. Ipswich's faith in the Scot was apparent 14 months ago when they awarded him a four-year contract before promotion had been secured. This improved, longer deal underlines the club's determination to retain one of the country's brightest managers. Burley, who spent most of his playing career at Ipswich, has transformed the club since he left Colchester in December 1994 to take over a team bottom of the Premiership. \"I couldn't be any happier,\" the 44-year-old said. \"Last year was the most special moment of my career as a player or manager. This year it has just got better and better.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
