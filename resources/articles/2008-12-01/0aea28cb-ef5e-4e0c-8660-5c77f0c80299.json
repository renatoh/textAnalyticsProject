The ABC affiliate there reports that Jackson has been cooperating with prosecutors against Blaog for several months now, after the guv stopped support for an airport project Jackson was pushing. The skinny: The topic was a proposed third airport at Peotone, Jackson's pet project which needed more state money. Rezko allegedly demanded that the governor be given control of the airport's board. Jackson refused and state support for the project stopped. Then last summer, weeks after Rezko was found guilty of un-related corruption, the U.S. Attorney's Office interviewed the congressman as a possible witness against the governor in the Peotone matter. And sources tell ABC7 that Jackson has been in regular contact with the feds and has told the government that in 2003 Blagojevich denied the congressman's wife Sandi an appointment as Illinois lottery director because Jackson would not donate $25,000 to the governor's campaign fund. So Jackson has evidently been working with prosecutors. So it is entirely possible that the Jackson emissary who allegedly went to Blago offering to raise money was acting without Jackson's knowledge or maybe merely making up a story. I understand that this sort of news comes as a great disappointment to those of you who already have Obama himself, let alone a small fish like Jackson, thrown in the slammer over this matter. Sadly for you folks, we do have this thing called the due-process system, and we operate on the belief that people not charged with a crime are, you know, probably not guilty of committing any crimes. In fact even people charged with crimes are of course presumed innocent. I understand this is a lot less fun than assuming that everyone (or everyone whose politics you don't agree with) is guilty of everything."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
