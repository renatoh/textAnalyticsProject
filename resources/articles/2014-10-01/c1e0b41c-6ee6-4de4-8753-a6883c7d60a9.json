Victory\u2019s impressive 4-1 win over Western Sydney last week, along with Adelaide\u2019s 2-1 away win over reigning champions Brisbane, should ensure the trend continues when they meet on Friday night at a redeveloped Adelaide Oval that is expected to be heaving. And not only with fans. Given Victory\u2019s dominance over the Wanderers \u2013 a dominance that owed much to the steel of Carl Valeri in midfield and the newfound cutting edge that Besart Berisha gives his team\u2014 Kevin Muscat\u2019s men will venture to Adelaide as favourites. But Josep Gombau has declared his team are \u201cnot afraid\u201d and that there are no lingering doubts over Adelaide\u2019s failure to beat Melbourne on three occasions last season, conceding a total of nine goals in the process. The personnel are largely the same, but this is a different Adelaide side, he infers. The Spanish armada is still in place but with a season and off-season behind them, Gombau\u2019s charges are better schooled in the sweet science of Catalonia. As they did against Brisbane, Adelaide will look to press high and worry errors out of a Victory team \u2013 who last week made the most passes of any team (516) and enjoyed the best passing accuracy (81.8%) \u2013 before countering. More of the same from Bruce Djite would be appreciated by the Reds\u2019 faithful in that regard. Defensively, however, Adelaide will have their work cut out trying to curtail the Victory\u2019s slick attack. In February, you\u2019ll recall, Sergio Cirio scored three for Adelaide against Victory only for the Reds to lose 4-3. The Wanderers\u2019 response The margin of defeat and the subdued nature of the Western Sydney Wanderers\u2019 performance against Melbourne Victory last week was both unprecedented and uncharacteristic but Tony Popovic is not the type to jump out of a window at the first sign of smoke. The Wanderers were due a lull after their ACL heroics, they were missing key personnel, and they came up against a side whose execution matched their resolve. \u201cI don\u2019t think the game was a reality check at all,\u201d Popovic said afterwards. \u201cWe lost a game of football ... we know what we have to do.\u201d Deliciously, the Wanderers get a chance to respond against their cross-town rivals, Sydney FC, and it adds an extra level of intrigue to the always atmospheric clash which looks set to be a sell-out (news that, earlier this week, prompted tiresome dick measuring from a giddy David Gallop and then NRL head of commercial Paul Kind, who defended NRL crowds at the SFS on account of shrinkage caused by a greater number of Sydney derbies). Of particular interest is the set-up of each team in light of the return of a number of players who, in a case of terrible timing prompted by the A-League\u2019s eagerness to make a start, missed the opening round on account of the international \u201cbreak\u201d: obdurate centre-half Nikolai Topor-Stanley for the Wanderers, \u201cmarquee Marc\u201d Janko, Bernie Ibini and Ali Abbas for Sydney. Throw in the return from injury of Tomi Juric (Wanderers) and Shane Smeltz (Sydney), and this game has the feel of a do-over. The Wanderers in particular will be keen to make the most of it, not least because it will be their last hit-out before the first leg of their ACL final on Saturday week \u2013 a game Graham Arnold mischievously suggested on Thursday would be distracting for the Wanderers. Robert Koren\u2019s A-League debut With his silky equaliser last weekend David Villa has already made an impression on the field for Melbourne City and he\u2019s likely to do so off the field on Sunday if, as expected, a crowd of some 15,000 plus turns up to see him play (oh, OK, him and a few others, including Damien Duff who impressed last week). But Sunday\u2019s match against Newcastle \u2013 who were unlucky to lose the F3 derby against the Mariners last week \u2013 will give another of City\u2019s foreign stars a chance to outline his credentials. And they\u2019re credentials that are arguably more important to the club given he\u2019s a two-year signing. Former Slovenia international Robert Koren \u2013 most recently of Hull City in the Premier League \u2013 is set to make his A-League debut on Sunday and while he may not play 90 minutes he\u2019ll surely get an opportunity to slip into the No10 role and begin what City hopes will be a productive spell directing play and conjuring space. Villa, Duff and the likes of Mate Dugandzic and David Williams, who returns this week, could come to love him for it. McGlinchey\u2019s early return to Gosford The Central Coast Mariners and their fans must have been resigning themselves to a barely deserved home draw last week against Newcastle when Mitchell Duke scored in injury time. Moments away from trudging home disconsolately they\u2019d just been given a wonderful tonic, like finding $20 in the pocket of a pair of jeans you haven\u2019t worn in months. Adding to the feel-good moment the Mariners (well, their B-team) then went to the Gold Coast on Tuesday night and put five unanswered goals past Palm Beach in the FFA Cup quarter-finals, Matt Sim bagging four of them. They might have been expected to win, and win handsomely, but that doesn\u2019t negate the confidence a win \u2013 and goals \u2013 instils. So Phil Moss will be keen to see his well-settled side produce something against Wellington that\u2019s more than just \u201cbrave\u201d. A more composed contribution from speedy Senegalese striker Malick Mane could be just the thing to do it. Trying to throw a spanner in the Mariners\u2019 works will be, among others, Kenny Cunningham returning from suspension, and Phoenix midfielder Michael McGlinchey, who played five seasons with the Mariners before spending the off-season caught up in a contract dispute as he sought to leave Gosford for Wellington, the place of his birth. McGlinchey scores about as often as Haley\u2019s Comet makes an appearance, and considering he got on the scoresheet last week, the Mariners should be safe. But players coming up against their old team have a habit of making their presence known. Perth to take the Lowe road Both Perth and Brisbane had unexpected starts to the new season last week; defending champions Brisbane by losing 2-1 at home to Adelaide, Perth by winning in Wellington for just the second time in their past 12 matches. So the Glory have every right to be bullish going into Sunday\u2019s home fixture between the two sides. Indeed, Kenny Lowe has promised his team will attack Brisbane (who\u2019ll be without suspended captain Matt McKay), indicating this will be his team\u2019s philosophy all season. \u201cWhether we\u2019re home or away, we\u2019re not going to change this year \u2013 we are going to try to win football matches,\u201d he said. Fans love to hear this kind of thing, and they love it even more when teams follow through, for it makes for an open and exciting game. Brisbane, however, may be just as happy to hear of Perth\u2019s plans (which could, admittedly, be some kind of Trojan trick, albeit an unspectacular one \u2013 \u201cWait a second! They\u2019re not attacking us at all \u2026 They\u2019re just parking the horse!\u201d). They\u2019re one of the league\u2019s best sides at catching teams on the break and a headstrong Glory outfit may give them the best opportunity to put last week\u2019s disappointment behind them.
