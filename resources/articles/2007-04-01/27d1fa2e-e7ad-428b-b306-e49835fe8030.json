Chemists will analyse the complex mix of gases released by books at Cambridge University's library, helping them to gauge which titles are most at risk of decaying. The research is designed to help conservators at libraries to spot which books are most in need of preservation. When books start to decompose, the decaying pages release chemicals, including volatile acids, which make the books decay even faster. \"The same emissions cause the musty smell beloved of habitual 'book sniffers',\" a university spokeswoman said. The scientists will analyse air samples from different parts of the library to work out how different storage conditions affect the speed at which books decay. The project will help identify the best environments for regularly used books and how best to store rarer reference tomes. \"We are comparing copies of the same book to see how usage and environment takes its toll,\" said Alan Farrant, head of conservation at the library. The library holds 8m books, around a quarter of which are stored on the open shelves. Ultimately, the researchers hope to develop an early-warning system to alert librarians when books need prompt attention. A previous conservation project, which compared the state of books at libraries in Wales, London and elsewhere, found that those held in Welsh libraries were in much better condition because they were exposed to less pollution. Alison McKay, conservator at the Bodleian library at Oxford, said libraries carefully control environmental conditions to help prevent books from decaying."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
