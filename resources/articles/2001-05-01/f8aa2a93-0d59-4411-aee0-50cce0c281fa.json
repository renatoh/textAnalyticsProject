But that could soon change. Cricket chiefs are seeking to break away from village greens and take the sport into some of the poorest urban areas in the country - in a bid to stop young people turning to crime. A major new scheme, headed by West Indian sporting hero Viv Richards, will this year seek to take the game into deprived estates and schools across Britain. Over the next two months cricket workshops will be held in places from Newcastle to Hackney, via Leeds, Nottingham, Birmingham and Gloucester. If no grassed area is available, they will take place in the streets. Local coaches will be trained to keep the sport going once the summer is over and disused sites will be converted into cricket pitches. Richards will host coaching sessions himself in many of the cities. 'It is all about getting cricket into parts of the country where it is not usually played. Cricket can really help people in the inner cities and make a difference to their lives,' said Tim Hodgson, a co-ordinator for Activate, a sports development group running the project on behalf of the England and Wales Cricket Board and funded by Channel 4. A club in south London has been lauded as a role model for others to follow. Brixton lacks many things - jobs are scarce, schools are poor and the police are understaffed. But for one man what was really missing from the area was a cricket pitch. If you got that, cricket coach Tony Moody believed, you could start to combat everything else. So began a Brixton fairytale and the story of the Lambeth Cricket Club, a team from the local estates who still practise on a concrete wicket and have no ground to call their own, but who have humbled the might of Surrey. 'We are going to make Brixton something to be proud of. The quality of life here is going to increase. People need to be proud of it, away from the image of muggers and riots,' Moody said. The task is huge. Brixton's crime problems include vicious gangs of Yardies who control the local drug trade. Two weeks ago a man was killed while sitting in his car on a Brixton street in a shooting police have linked to the Yardies. A woman was recently kneecapped after accidentally running into the back of a gangster's car. But for Moody these terrible influences can be fought off from a cricket crease. Moody, 47, who came to Brixton from the West Indies when he was 13, long had a dream of getting local youths involved in cricket to keep them off the streets. After working for 14 years as a hotel security guard, he gave up his job and began to teach cricket in the local schools. Interest was huge and he formed a youth team. By 1998 he had enough players to form the Lambeth club. For Reco Gilfillian, 18, and dozens of teenagers like him, the club has been a saviour. Moody's passion for cricket was infectious and led to the discovery of hidden talents in people who might never have considered the game. 'Cricket gives you something to do. There are bad influences and bad people around, but cricket keeps people from just hanging around the streets where they might get into gangs. I don't know where I would be without cricket,' he said. After first meeting Moody when he came to coach in his primary school, Gilfillian has now played for a Surrey County Cricket Club youth team. 'I remember when he first picked up a ball. He clean-bowled me on the school playground. What a talent,' remembered Moody. Last year Lambeth played Surrey's under-19s at The Oval - and won easily. Orane Turner, 17, who hit the winning run, has gone on to play for a Surrey youth team. 'It was great. I never thought I would ever get to play at The Oval,' he said. But in terms of facilities Lambeth is a cricketing desert. Some 250,000 people live in the borough, but there is only one cricket pitch - and that is The Oval. The Lambeth club still practise on the concrete school pitch where they began life three years ago, and have to play all their games away or in neighbouring parts of London. But that is going to change. Richards is to meet the team in August as part of a plan to donate space in a local park to provide Lambeth with a permanent home - and its very first grass pitch. Moody said: 'Usually we play teams in villages in Kent or Surrey, and now we will be able to invite them to play at our home ground and give them the full Brixton experience. It is actually a wonderful area and I am sure they will enjoy that,' he said. paul.harris@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
