The 21-year-old seamer has played five first-class games in his career but after two seasons starring in the T20 Blast led to Friday\u2019s England debut in the victory over New Zealand, he can already call himself an international. It was the steel shown in closing out the home side\u2019s subpar innings that led to a healthy dose of praise from the captain, Eoin Morgan, on the day. Brown went for six runs in the 20th over \u2013 gold dust at that stage of proceedings \u2013 and removed the experienced Ross Taylor for his first international scalp. The dismissal was typical of the skills that earned his call-up for this T20 series: a slower ball fooled Taylor for a catch in the deep, even if Alan Richardson, Worcestershire\u2019s respected bowling coach, joked that his pupil will tell folk that \u201cc Bairstow b Brown\u201d was a nick behind in years to come. The bowler does not want to be pigeon-holed just yet, however, with a stress fracture detected in his lower back last winter \u2013 one that continues to be managed \u2013 the reason he did not appear during the 2019 County Championship campaign. \u201cI kept it simple [on his debut] but there are definitely more tricks to come,\u201d said Brown, who will follow this tour with spells in Abu Dhabi\u2019s T10 tournament and at the Melbourne Stars in Australia\u2019s Big Bash League. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a nice compliment if people think I have written off first-class cricket. It means they rate my white\u2011ball stuff highly. But it\u2019s something I\u2019m definitely looking to do and stop the boys saying I have got red-ball rash.\u201d The back injury \u2013 one Brown puts down to his body \u201cgetting in some pretty minging positions\u201d \u2013 allowed him to complete a degree in business management at the University of Worcester, although this first England outing has meant missing out on the graduation ceremony. Brown said making the squad for next year\u2019s T20 World Cup in Australia is on everyone\u2019s mind in this fresh-faced touring party but he has yet to detect any \u201canimosity towards the new boys or fear for people\u2019s places\u201d. That is not the way under Morgan, whose captaincy Brown likens to that of Moeen Ali\u2019s at Worcestershire. \u201cThey do it in different ways but get the same message across,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s calm and collected. They make you feel like you are going to nail whatever ball you go for and all they really ask for is clarity in your plan and to not going into something half-hearted. \u201cMo has made me a much better player over the last two years by [me] bouncing ideas off him and being in his company. He is an unbelievable player and it would be nice to have him here as a familiar face. But Morgs has been really good.\u201d Brown believes his two T20 Finals Day appearances \u2013 winning the trophy in 2018 before losing in the final this year \u2013 can only help him adjust to the atmosphere and scrutiny of international cricket. But it is 2018\u2019s losing semi-final against Kent in the Royal London Cup, a tournament he will miss next year when playing in the Hundred, that shaped him as a death bowler after failing to defend 11 runs in the final over. \u201cHaving that moment and that failure really spurred me on to be the man who gets the team over the line,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a death bowler, you\u2019ve got to want to do it. If you don\u2019t fully commit to certain things and you are on the back foot, you get found out.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
