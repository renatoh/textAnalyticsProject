More of a legend than a brand, this is the company whose logo may be found tattooed on to its followers' bodies (not something even the proudest Triumph or Fireblade owner would undertake). This isn't brand loyalty, it's religion. Likewise, a Harley Davidson is more than a motorbike: it's an icon, embodying freedom, masculinity, adventure and a whole lot besides. Or so the Harley PR blurb has put it about over the years. Other bikers beg to differ. To them Harley-Davidsons are ungainly, ostentatious lumps of metal that take half an hour to get from nought to 60 and handle like sacks of coal. And as for Harley riders; Milwaukee executive once observed: 'What we sell is the ability for a 43-year-old accountant to dress in black leather, ride through small towns and have people be afraid of him.' Is it me or is there something faintly tragic about all those menopausal men pretending to be Dennis Hopper? I must admit that, until very recently, I was no lover of the Harley-Davidson marque. But all that changed - and one look at the photo that accompanies this piece may explain why. Every now and then a machine is created whose design is so flawlessly beautiful that it becomes an overnight classic. Apple did it with the candy-coloured iMac: you didn't want to work on it - you wanted to put it on your desk and lick it. Similarly, this is a bike you want to put on a plinth and just gaze at, admiring your reflection in voluptuous swathes of anodised aluminium. The styling of the V-Rod is pure liquid metal: flowing, sinuous lines of silver that carry you all the way from the steeply raked front forks to the slash-cut silencers on the exhaust. The solid aluminium wheels also give it the illusion of movement even when stationary - one of many graceful design touches. This is a truly beautiful bike. Once aboard, I took the V-Rod for an exhibition ride up the full length of the King's Road. To say that heads turned would be an understatement. Double-taking pedestrians fell over bins and walked into one another. At every traffic light a head would pop out of a car window and start inquiring about the bike. Beginning to feel something of a traffic hazard, I pointed the V-Rod's long nose over Battersea Bridge and headed south in search of the open road. And here is when my preconceptions about what it's like to ride a Harley-Davidson began to be challenged in earnest. With 1,130cc of water-cooled V-Twin between my knees, I expected the V-Rod to have plenty of grunt. What I did not expect was the blistering performance that it delivered. Acceleration was strong throughout the range, but especially in the upper reaches of the rev counter, making overtaking an effortless affair even in higher gears. As I began to encounter clusters of bikers making their way down the A3, I found that the V-Rod could hold its own with all but the lairiest of the Japanese racers. Cornering, it's true, is not the V-Rod's greatest strength. The long wheel-base and low centre of gravity are fine for long, swooping curves, but make for rather ponderous turning into sharper bends, although the brakes are crisp enough, biting hard when you need them. I found it less unnerving to shift bodyweight around the bends rather than lean the bike over too enthusiastically and risk scraping that elegant exhaust. My only other niggle was the sound. I have always revelled in the trademark Harley rumble and frequently daydreamed about gunning a hog through, say, the Rotherhithe Tunnel, just to see if I could shake some tiles off the walls. But the V-Rod never sounds this good (or bad), even when throttled hard, and at lower revs issues a well-bred purr rather than a full-throated growl. But this is surely something a visit to the custom shop could sort out. Harley claims the V-Rod is the most radical motorcycle in the company's 100-year history, as well as being its most powerful production bike ever. They're not wrong. This bike is the daddy of them all. It will draw people to the marque who, like me, would never have considered buying a Harley; and it will delight legions of Harley fanatics for years to come. Which leaves you the small matter of laying your hands on \u00a314,095 if you want to act on my advice - excluding the tattoo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
