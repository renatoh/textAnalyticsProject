The Saracens and England No 8, who has started only three internationals in two years because of injuries to his shoulders, knees and arms, was responding to an RFU report that revealed the severity of injuries in top-level English rugby is on the rise. \u201cThe report is scary but I\u2019m not sure how to address it,\u201d Vunipola said. \u201cIt is just the way the game has gone. Everyone is so desperate to win that defences have just become so unbelievably tough to break down and sometimes the only way to break it down is to run over or through people. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it is going to change. You can\u2019t just tell someone who has worked his whole life that he has to lose size otherwise someone else will use size to batter them down.\u201d Vunipola admits he was unusually nervous during his comeback against Sale last Friday \u2013 unsurprisingly given he was returning from his third broken arm in 2018. \u201cI was a bit tentative and anxious,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore I was a bit naive that I could fall straight into it, whereas now I am a bit more prepared. And scared as well. But it\u2019s a good thing to have that fear. It will hopefully drive me and help me to protect myself better.\u201d And while Eddie Jones has promised to treat Vunipola like the \u201cking\u2019s baby\u201d when he returns to the England squad, the player insists he does not need any special treatment. \u201cI just want to be like everyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to play, I want to experience Twickenham again, I want to experience the Six Nations rugby again. And those times on Thursdays when you have those chocolates. Those are the things you take for granted. I want to stay fit but I don\u2019t want to be mediocre.\u201d Asked what he had learned during all his injury problems, Vunipola replied: \u201cThe biggest thing was to become humble again. I think I was becoming too big for my shoes. You don\u2019t know it is happening until you realise how much you rate yourself. This time I want to keep my head down and just work hard.\u201d One consequence of his injuries is Vunipola is now on tablets after a blood test showed he had very low levels of vitamin D. \u201cI think with my skin colour and not having that much sun, it has affected it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not big on tablets so it took a lot of convincing. But I guess if it works it will work. We\u2019ll see.\u201d With Saracens unbeaten in the Champions Cup and the World Cup to come this autumn, Vunipola knows he could have a big 2019 but his biggest wish is just to stay healthy. \u201cI want to be fit and good,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be the same player, I want to be better as well.\u201d He has been told by the Saracens coach, Mark McCall, that he will need to improve on his comeback match against Sale to be considered for England\u2019s Six Nations opener against Ireland. \u201cOrdinarily Billy comes back with a storming performance but this time it was a bit more tentative,\u201d said McCall, whose side play at Lyon in the Champions Cup on Sunday. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s understandable because his return was delayed a week because the consultant was a bit nervous about the arm, and Billy was too.\u201d When asked whether Vunipola would be ready to face Ireland, McCall said: \u201cYes, probably. But he\u2019ll have to play better than he did last weekend.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
