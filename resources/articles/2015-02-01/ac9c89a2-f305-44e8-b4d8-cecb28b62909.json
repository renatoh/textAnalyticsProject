England\u2019s George Kruis has started only twice for his country and now has to measure himself against the veteran Irish colossus Paul O\u2019Connell and the 6ft 10in giant Devin Toner. Back in 2009 when O\u2019Connell was captaining the Lions, Kruis was on a gap-year trip to South Africa with some mates from Dorking RFC. It just goes to show how dramatically sport\u2019s wheel of fortune can turn. Kruis is now not just England\u2019s starting lock \u2013 injuries to Courtney Lawes, Geoff Parling and Joe Launchbury having opened the door \u2013 but is rated among the fittest members of England\u2019s squad. No one within the England squad is about to underestimate O\u2019Connell before Sunday\u2019s game in Dublin but, equally, the visiting front five do not look or sound remotely intimidated. The 25-year-old Kruis has already contributed to a fine win in intimidating surroundings in Cardiff and has also played Munster often enough to know exactly what is coming. How interesting, then, to hear him suggest England have the set-piece tools to sort out Ireland\u2019s pack at the Aviva Stadium. \u201cWe do have a very good set piece and we don\u2019t try to hide that fact,\u201d stresses the Saracens forward. \u201cIt will be a big weapon of ours and hopefully we can deploy it.\u201d Now 35 and entering the twilight of a wonderful career, O\u2019Connell has heard such things before but Ireland have lost the last three fixtures between the two countries and memories of England\u2019s scrummaging dominance at Twickenham in 2012 have not entirely faded. The England forwards coach Graham Rowntree has been delighted by the way Kruis has imposed himself at the highest level. \u201cHe is a very composed young man and I also love it in lineout meetings or in big team sessions when he stands up and tells us what we have to do, not arrogantly, but showing he understands his role,\u201d Rowntree says. \u201cHe does his homework and that\u2019s what gives him that confidence. I\u2019ve been very impressed by him. From watching his performances, you wouldn\u2019t underestimate him as an opponent. He deserves that respect.\u201d Considering Kruis weighed only 92kg (14st 6lb) six years ago \u2013 he is now 116kg (18st 3lb) and 6ft 6in \u2013 his ascent in every sense has been remarkable. Even he concedes playing Test rugby was \u201ca very distant dream\u201d in 2009 when, as a teenager, he watched O\u2019Connell and co from the Cape Town stands. \u201cI was just joining Saracens and was rather underweight and not the best rugby player,\u201d he says, reflecting on his days at Dorking in the shadows of the Wasps prop Jake Cooper-Woolley and the Surrey cricketer Jason Roy. \u201cBut I\u2019d learned at school that you get places by working hard so I just thought I\u2019d give it my absolute best. I began to see improvements quite quickly.\u201d European showdowns with O\u2019Connell and Munster have also played their part in accelerating his rugby education, particularly his first trip to Limerick. \u201cI remember going there for my first or second Heineken Cup game and seeing Munster flags in the houses. For me it was a big eye-opener of how they support teams in Ireland. It was huge but I guess going there as an international team it will be that much bigger.\u201d As for the mighty O\u2019Connell, Kruis freely acknowledges there are few more influential warriors out there \u2013 \u201cHe is a clear talisman for Irish rugby \u2026 I have a huge amount of respect for him\u201d \u2013 and Rowntree is equally conscious that England will have to replicate their impressive second-half effort in Cardiff to secure victory. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive game and we\u2019ll need a performance up there with that Welsh performance if we are going to get near to beating them,\u201d says Rowntree, quietly confident England will not fold as they did when chasing the title in Dublin in 2011. \u201cOur composure is better in terms of coming back after going behind. We\u2019re a lot more settled and composed as a team. The art is not to chase the game too early and to stick to our plan. That was an issue in 2011.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
