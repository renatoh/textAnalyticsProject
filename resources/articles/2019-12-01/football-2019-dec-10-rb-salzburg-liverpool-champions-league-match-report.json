The pressure was on in Salzburg and J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team responded with a performance befitting European champions to preserve their dreams of a third consecutive final appearance and a return to Istanbul. It was far from easy against the Austrian champions. Liverpool made it appear so. The Premier League leaders claimed first place in Group E with a victory built on the experience of champions, resolute defending and brilliant execution from their front line. Salzburg contributed to an enthralling finale but from the moment Sadio Man\u00e9 created the breakthrough for Naby Ke\u00efta the visitors assumed absolute control. Mohamed Salah, guilty of several earlier misses, struck an exquisite second 100 seconds later and Klopp\u2019s team cruised into the knockout phase they thrive upon. Liverpool have reached the final of every European competition they have played in under Klopp, never losing a two-legged European tie with him. They can head to the Club World Cup in Qatar next week confident of continuing those remarkable sequences when the Champions League resumes in the new year. Victory looked routine by the time Man\u00e9 missed Liverpool\u2019s final chance of the night but it had been a tense affair until Ke\u00efta struck. Alisson and Virgil van Dijk had to be at their authoritative best as Jesse Marsch\u2019s team started with the belief they could qualify with Napoli at the expense of the European champions. Salzburg\u2019s coach and players had been full of confidence in the buildup to the club\u2019s biggest European night. It was immediately apparent they had tools to back up the talk. From the bravery to play through and around Liverpool\u2019s press to intricate one-touch moves around the visitors\u2019 penalty area, the hosts opened with the arrogance of youth and the belief of domestic champions. Van Dijk was called into evasive action to deny both Erling Haaland and Hwang Hee-chan inside the first minute. Notice had been served that this was to be a demanding night for the Liverpool defence. Notice was taken. Alisson made six saves in the first half \u2013 only one in the second \u2013 with the most impressive arriving when the Salzburg playmaker Takumi Minamino back-heeled Hwang into space and he looked to score from close range, having twisted inside Jordan Henderson. The Brazilian made a fine left-handed stop and also denied the eye-catching Enock Mwepu twice, Hwang again and Haaland before the break. The contest was utterly compelling because it flowed end to end and, despite Salzburg\u2019s swagger in possession, it was Liverpool who crafted the clearer openings. Fine goalkeeping from Cican Stankovic and poor finishing by Salah ensured Liverpool were kept waiting for the breakthrough. The game opened at a frenetic pace with more goalmouth activity in the first 15 minutes than the entirety of many contests. Liverpool\u2019s first excellent opening arrived from the direct source of a Dejan Lovren ball down the centre. The Salzburg central defender Maximilian W\u00f6ber, a weak link, misjudged the flight and allowed Salah a clean run on goal. The Egypt international took the shot early but Stankovic stood up well to make an important block. Salah had no excuse for failing to beat the goalkeeper next time, however. Ke\u00efta burst into space vacated by W\u00f6ber after the Austrian overcommitted. As Salzburg defenders closed in the Guinean released Salah free inside the area but, with only Stankovic to beat, he dragged a first-time shot horribly wide. The Liverpool forward almost made amends on the stroke of half-time with a delightful pass into the overlapping run of Ke\u00efta. Stankovic was again to the rescue, racing out quickly to smother the midfielder\u2019s shot and breathing a sigh of relief when the rebound struck Ke\u00efta\u2019s chest and sailed out for a goal-kick. It was the same story at the start of the second half. The former Salzburg striker Man\u00e9 released Salah in behind the defence with an exquisite pass but his instinctive shot sailed over. When Roberto Firmino threaded another ball between the hosts\u2019 defence and Salah attempted to round Stankovic, the keeper got a vital touch at the last and another chance had gone. It was a mark of champions that this did not disturb Liverpool or Salah. Two goals in two minutes, both involving Stankovic rushing from his line unnecessarily and excellent finishes, turned a troublesome night into a triumphant one for Klopp\u2019s team. The Salzburg keeper may have been over-confident following earlier events but beyond question was the quality of Liverpool\u2019s goals. The opener arrived moments after Joe Gomez had replaced the injured Lovren. Trent Alexander-Arnold swept the substitute\u2019s pass over to Andy Robertson, who touched on to Man\u00e9. In a flash the Senegal international darted past J\u00e9r\u00f4me Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 into the area and, as Stankovic stormed off his line, he clipped an inch-perfect cross from the left for Ke\u00efta to head home. Salzburg\u2019s hopes crumbled within seconds. Henderson sprayed a hopeful ball behind Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 for Salah to chase. The defender connected with a weak header and the error was compounded by Stankovic sprinting out of his area in an attempt to clear. Salah easily beat him too it but his first touch took the ball towards the byline. No matter. He simply curled a deft finish goalwards and forgot the previous misses as his hardest chance of the night nestled inside the far post. An outstanding finish and Liverpool coasted into the knockout stage from that point on. They remain the team to fear in Europe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
