But whoever\u2019s talking, the pop star \u2013 arguably the most controversial in Africa \u2013 is spoken about in near-mythological tones, which makes his amiability very arresting when we meet in London a few weeks before lockdown. He arrives flanked by an entourage, photoshoot-ready in a reflective puffer, and oscillates between class clown and deep thought. To some, the 25-year-old\u2019s meteoric rise over the past two years has been sudden: selling out Brixton Academy in three minutes; accruing three million Instagram followers, tens of millions of streams, and a cult-like fandom. But the signs of stardom have always been there. Born Afeez Fashola in Agege, Lagos, Marley moved to Peckham, London, aged 11. As a teen he was a keen freestyle rapper, but was initially more interested in the management side of music. During a studio session he facilitated for friends in 2014, he recorded the instant hit Marry Juana on a whim. The track helped usher in the fusion of UK rap, dancehall and Afrobeats that now frequently hits the UK charts, by such artists as J Hus, Darkoo, Young T &amp; Bugsey. The blend of influences is referenced in his name: Naira is the currency of Nigeria, and Marley reggae royalty. \u201cI knew it was a new sound and I wasn\u2019t sure if people were gonna take to it,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it would be a big impact, with everyone following afterwards.\u201d African intonation is now commonplace in the UK music scene, but back then, a Caribbean lilt was the standard among MCs \u2013 regardless of their background. \u201cI was already proud of being African and had a problem with the fact we couldn\u2019t be ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I just went with my accent and it sounded wavy.\u201d Marley made waves with UK rap bangers Back2Work and Money On the Road. It was difficult to immediately associate him with one genre: he had a scampish likability combined with the edge of a road rapper. When he started frequently visiting Lagos, his music took on the sunnier sound of Afrobeats and his popularity skyrocketed. When Marley shared a snippet of his 2018 single Issa Goal on Instagram, it instantly launched the social media trend that went on to dominate that summer, the shaku shaku dance, and became the semi-official song for the Nigerian football team. He launched the label Marlian Music, and is currently on the lookout for its first female artist. \u201cI actually want a fat girl,\u201d he says with a grin. \u201cMusic is spiritual \u2013 it\u2019s not about the look only. There\u2019s actually fat people in the world, you know? It doesn\u2019t have to be skinny people singing only.\u201d But there has been a major bump in this ascent: his arrest by Nigeria\u2019s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). It began when another Afrobeats artist, Simi, chastised the actions of the country\u2019s \u201cYahoo boys\u201d \u2013 internet conmen nicknamed after the search engine. In response, Marley wrote an Instagram post saying: \u201cIf u know about slavery \u2026 yahoo no b crime\u201d and later asked Nigerians to \u201cpray for internet fraudsters\u201d rather than criticise them, arguing that they kept money circulating in the country. Nigeria is keen to shed its reputation for internet fraud, and Marley was accused of exacerbating it. A backlash followed, further whipped up by Marley\u2019s antagonistically titled single Am I a Yahoo Boy featuring Nigerian rapper Zlatan. The lyrics were provocative (the Nigerian government is cast as \u201cthieves\u201d) as was the video, which featured a mock-up of Marley being arrested. The day after its release, he and Zlatan were arrested in real life along with three others. Marley was held in custody for 35 days and the case is ongoing, meaning he can\u2019t comment on it directly. He faces 11 charges of credit-card fraud, for allegedly conspiring to use credit card numbers that didn\u2019t belong to him, and having counterfeit cards as well as cards that weren\u2019t his own. If convicted, he could be jailed for up to seven years. He has pleaded not guilty. In a statement, his management argued he was being held \u201cbased on a cheeky song\u201d. \u201cNaira did not publicly [defend] those who commit fraud,\u201d it reads. \u201cHe expressed his view on the situation, which was simply his opinion.\u201d He appears undeterred: the cover art of his single Why?, released shortly after his arrest, shows him raising his arms in handcuffs. In Bad Influence, he continues to take potshots at Nigeria\u2019s leaders, declaring himself a scapegoat for their own failings. \u201cWe want school, but they give us prison,\u201d is one of the lyrics. He tells me: \u201cI\u2019ve always been political because I was born in Nigeria, where everything is not the way it\u2019s meant to be. I\u2019ve always been against the corruption.\u201d Comparisons between legendary Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti and the artists of the contemporary pop style Afrobeats are common. But Marley, who sings \u201cthey want to treat me like they treated Fela\u201d, is also drawing comparisons with the government\u2019s repression of Kuti, who was arrested more than 200 times after speaking out against Nigeria\u2019s violent, corrupt mid-century regime. \u201cAll my music is not straight at the government, straight political, but there\u2019s a lot of similarities,\u201d he says. \u201cThe weed, the I-don\u2019t-care attitude, the freedom \u2013 speaking your mind and the government coming to arrest you.\u201d I ask him what he learned during his time in prison in Lagos. \u201cThat I\u2019m powerful,\u201d he says without any pause. \u201cNot to be big-headed, but I influence a lot of people.\u201d His devoted fanbase, known as Marlians, protested outside the EFCC headquarters for the entirety of his stay and rallied around him with the #FreeNairaMarley hashtag. His impact is undeniable: from helping to pioneer the Afrobashment style, to heading viral dance crazes, such as the shaku shaku and the tesumole dance. Soapy, his first major single since his arrest, is accompanied by a dance simulating masturbation, and took over the streets of Lagos, unsurprisingly provoking ire. But the Marlians are the biggest testament to his influence, something that goes beyond mere fandom. \u201cI\u2019m a Marlian myself,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a way of life. It\u2019s a country.\u201d \u201cA religion,\u201d his manager offers from across the room, laughing. \u201cA cult!\u201d The loosely defined Marlian ideology almost exists outside of Marley himself. It\u2019s chiefly about pushing back against a strangling status quo and its adherents have their own rules \u2013 Marlians don\u2019t wear belts or celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day, nor do they do a whole host of other arbitrary things, having decided that this is the way to best embody the spirit of their musical deity. Marley is laid back about most of the rules created in his name, but makes it clear he doesn\u2019t agree with everything. He mentions a recent story that hit the Nigerian press, regarding a teen Marlian who was suspended for not wearing underwear to school, as per alleged Marlian guidelines. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell them not to wear pant,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cThere\u2019s even pastors praying in church saying, \u2018I cast the spirit of Marlian out of your children. Your children will graduate!\u2019\u201d With his dreads, penchant for weed and disregard for authority, Marley is the embodiment of everything that inherently conservative Nigerian society dislikes, particularly in its youth. He is the physical manifestation of parents\u2019 fears over their children joining \u201cbad gang\u201d \u2013 boasting of \u201cno mannaz\u201d, and rubbishing Nigerian higher education. His ubiquity within the Nigerian press, equal parts erroneous and hysterical, means anything he says makes headlines. Though a great deal is deliberately provocative, there is always method in his madness, he assures. Even Soapy has more to it that its immediate lewd premise: it\u2019s a mediation on his prison experience. \u201cI just added the dance so it wasn\u2019t as serious,\u201d he says. One of his most controversial statements on Twitter \u2013 \u201cMarlians Don\u2019t Graduate, We Drop Out\u201d \u2013 led to inevitable uproar in a nation where formal education is highly valued. He tells me his message was misconstrued: \u201cThere are corporate Marlians, there are dropout Marlians \u2013 all kind of Marlians.\u201d Another statement that rankled was: \u201cHaving a big booty is better than having a masters degree.\u201d Though on the surface ridiculous, the sentiment may be difficult to dispute. Last year, 55% of young people in Nigeria aged 15 to 35 were unemployed, and graduates were among the worst affected. Meanwhile, the country\u2019s Instagram models and influencers are big business. \u201cIt\u2019s not a joke!\u201d he says emphatically. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be better, but it is better, in Nigeria especially: big-bummed girls that didn\u2019t even graduate can get a job easily. It\u2019s better to have a big bum than qualifications \u2013 you have more of a chance.\u201d This is what draws young Nigerians to Marley most of all: his willingness to confront the establishment\u2019s hypocrisy. \u201cThey are still backwards,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not free, they don\u2019t believe in equality, they don\u2019t believe, if you\u2019re 18, you can make decisions yourself. They don\u2019t believe in freedom of speech. I\u2019m making people speak their mind, making people make their own decisions.\u201d Marley knows something that his naysayers don\u2019t yet seem to have grasped: the more they clutch their pearls, the more powerful he becomes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
