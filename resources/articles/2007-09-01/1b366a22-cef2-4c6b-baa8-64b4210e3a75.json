John Mayer's Indo-Jazz Fusions showed the way, followed by John McLaughlin, Trilok Gurtu, French band Mukti and many others. Now we have Norwegian quartet the Core, collaborating with guests Kanchman Babbar (flutes), Fateh Ali (sitar) and Prasenjit Mitra (tabla) to make The Indian Core. The CD is drawn from live recordings made during a tour of Norway. Founder-drummer Espen Aalberg drives the ensemble along with an even, flowing style that leaves plenty of space for Mitra's polyrhythms, and the band generates plenty of heat on stretched-out numbers such as Agra and Ull Raga. The Indian musicians sound at home in this defiantly acoustic nu-jazz, and Babbar's flute solos are a constant source of pleasure, combining Indian inflections and melodies with a jazzy \"sound of surprise\", and a vocalised timbre that springs from both cultures."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
