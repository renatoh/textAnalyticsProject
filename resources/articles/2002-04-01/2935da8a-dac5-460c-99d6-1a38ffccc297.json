But if you want to distinguish yourself from the pack and boost your job prospects it may be worth entering one of the growing number of student competitions advertised on campus. Run by major employers such as Ford or Deloitte and Touche, these work-related competitions can help develop a range of skills including team working, problem solving and task management - the kind employers want. \"Competitions prepare students for the outside world, encouraging them to pit their skills and take risks against other people\" says Cary Cooper, professor of occupational psychology at the University of Manchester Institute of Technology (UMIST). \"Graduates are going to face failure and rejection and they need to develop the resilience to bounce back. If they wallow in job rejection or lack of promotion they won't succeed in the long run. Competitions equip them to cope with these potential setbacks.\" The Ford Motor Company sponsors the University of East Anglia's Business and Investment Management Game (BIMG). The competition is open to senior managers as well as students and gives participants a chance to develop business ideas. The game begins with 250 teams competing against each other to manufacture a product. The game comprises three rounds each lasting six weeks and during the earlier part of the game business decisions are taken weekly on issues such as pricing policy, marketing strategy and raising loans. The game progresses to a knockout with five teams competing in a live final at UEA. Prizes include \u00a3350 in cash or an award in the shape of a lead crystal rose bowel. The game gives undergraduates a chance to take on team members from big firms like KPMG and it's not unusual for students to beat corporate teams. Students from Edinburgh University, for example, won a recent final. \"The competition improves decision making, business acumen, risk assessment skills and commercial awareness,\" says Colin Rymill of the BIMG. \"There is a lack of commercial awareness amongst graduates so those with some commercial awareness are more likely to get a job than those without it.\" Deloitte and Touche recently ran Just the Ticket , an innovative business competition designed to give students an insight into the challenges facing UK businesses. The game featured multiple choice business questions and was followed by more demanding questions based on two case studies. Around 14,000 undergraduates entered the competition and 30 went on to win prizes, including Raleigh International adventures in far flung places such as Namibia and Singapore and sponsorships of up to \u00a3500 a term. \"The competition helps them get to know how a major blue-chip company works and get a good general business awareness, as well as enhance our standing on campus,\" says Kerry Jarred of Deloitte and Touche. \"Last year we recruited around 750 graduates in the UK and this competition is excellent practice for candidates hoping to seize similar opportunities.\" Competitions can not only enhance your job prospects but also help finance your way through college. Yasin Davarzadeh, a first year computer science student from Goldsmith's College won \u20ac10,000 (\u00a36,100) in Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein's Web Trader competition, which allows individual or team players to buy a portfolio of stocks and shares with 'virtual' money. Prizes go to the players who increase their portfolio by the largest amounts. The second prizewinner scooped \u20ac5,000 (\u00a33,000). \"The competition gives students an awareness of stocks and shares and how the economy and stock market is moving,\" says Terence Perrin, head of European graduate recruitment for Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. \"It provides a good basis for a career in investment banking and people who hadn't thought of this area as a career before can go online and have fun.\" Competitions can take as much as two hours out of your weekly schedule for up to three months. So while they can be good for your career they won't be good for your course work unless you're organised and disciplined. But even if you don't win, the time devoted to entering a competition will still be worthwhile if you've picked up valuable skills, demonstrated initiative, met people and found something positive to say at future job interviews. Hannah Gal's career as an illustrator and photographer took off after she entered a calendar competition run by software company Adobe. \"My image entitled Holding Hands illustrated the month of May and led to commissions from creative companies who hung the calendar in their offices.\" Hannah is now one of the most successful creatives in her field, with clients like BT, Kodak, Apple and Sony Music commissioning her to do photo-illustrations. \"I love my craft and make a good living from it,\" enthuses Hannah a fine arts graduate. Hannah attributes her success in part to her ability to capitalise on the exposure generated by the competition. \"I sent additional work to potential clients and kept in touch, as some people didn't need my work straight away,\" she recalls. adeline@worksmartcommunications.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
