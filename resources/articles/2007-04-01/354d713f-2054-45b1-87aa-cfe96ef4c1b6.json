Scotland's most senior Catholic and the moderator of the Protestant Church of Scotland rebuked the chancellor as they joined him and Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, at Gleneagles to discuss progress on aid after the G8 summit there nearly two years ago. To loud applause from an audience of anti-poverty campaigners, charity executives and schoolchildren, Cardinal Keith O'Brien said: \"I would suggest we need trade, not Trident. We need to keep our promises on aid. And we need to make our aid work.\" The Rt Rev Alan McDonald, moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland and a minister near to Mr Brown's home town in Fife, said he was \"surprised at the ease\" with which the Treasury found the \u00a325bn needed to replace Trident, and the \u00a34.4bn spent on Iraq. \"What could that deliver to the poorest countries of the world?\" Their carefully coordinated ambush came as Mr Brown and the international development secretary, Hilary Benn, confirmed at the event that the UK is to lead a new global initiative to provide free education for the 75 million children worldwide without schooling. The government will give the UN children's agency Unicef \u00a320m to kickstart the \"education beyond borders\" programme, although Mr Brown acknowledged that educating every child worldwide would cost $10bn (\u00a35.07bn) a year. The chancellor sidestepped the criticisms on defence policy, but admitted that more action on poverty was needed by the UK and world leaders. The UK, he promised, would continue to take a lead. \"As human beings, we can't be fully happy when we know so many are sad. We can't feast while others starve. We can't be fully at ease while others are suffering,\" he said. The UK had also earmarked \u00a350m for a new reforestation programme in Africa, and begun work on a $1bn environmental \"transformation fund\", to tackle climate change, water depletion and deforestation, he said. Meanwhile, the UK would also wipe out the debts of 75 of the world's poorest nations and persuade other developed states to follow that lead. Yesterday's event at Gleneagles, an exclusive hotel in Perthshire where room prices start at \u00a3285 a night, was intended to mark two years' progress since the G8 summit there in July 2005 on meeting the summit's promises on aid, including increasing aid by $50bn a year by 2010. Charities at the event such as Save the Children, Oxfam and the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund said the UK was still missing its own targets on aid. The $50bn a year pledge was already being broken, and total UK aid levels had only increased \"slightly\". The Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund said the UK was \"double-counting\" the third world debts it had wiped out as aid. This meant the UK only spent 0.52% of GDP on aid, a long way short of meeting its 0.7% target set in 1970. The government needed to increase its aid spending by $7.8bn to meet its own promises. The church leaders' criticisms over Trident highlight a deep rift between the government and most Scottish civic leaders on nuclear weapons. A majority of Scottish Labour MPs voted against replacing Trident, and the controversy is being exploited by nationalists in the elections for the devolved parliament in Edinburgh. Mr Brown's father was a Church of Scotland minister in Fife, and the chancellor is a churchgoer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
