In practice there is still uncertainty about how community service by pupils will be put into practice. Citizenship programmes will become compulsory in secondary schools for 11 to 16 year olds from September next year and will, along with the school's other activities, be inspected by Ofsted. But many schools are already introducing programmes in the run-up to the changes. Education and skills secretary Estelle Morris has also suggested that 16 to 18 year olds will be expected to do voluntary work to gain new US-style graduation certificates. Community service is one strand in the citizenship agenda. A government-sponsored report in 1998 by Bernard Crick suggested that 5% of the curriculum be devoted to community service but the regulations governing the changes do not give a minimum number of hours. Peter Hayes, acting director of education at Community Service Volunteers (CSV), which has been working with a number of schools on citizenship, says: \"I don't think the number of hours is the issue. It should be about involving young people in active learning in the community.\" Volunteering needs to be integrated into the ethos of the school, he says, rather than bolted on and the worst thing would be if pupils were dragooned into \"worthy\" activities they were not interested in. Jenny Talbot, chief executive of the charity Institute for Citizenship, agrees: \"It's about encouraging youngsters and teachers know what turns kids off.\" Volunteering does not need to be outside the school, she adds: \"If you can encourage the kids to have a go in the supported environment of the school it makes it much more likely that they will be confident as young adults.\" In any case, many schools have been involved in some kind of volunteering for decades, such as the Duke of Edinburgh's Award or other projects, she says: \"It just hasn't been known as citizenship.\" A CSV spokesman says evidence shows that schools with community service programmes have less bullying and a more attractive school environment. He says: \"Importantly, people who start volunteering young are more likely to continue when they're adults.\" But there are obstacles, notably the extra teacher time and resources needed to supervise volunteering. David Marsh, citizenship co-ordinator at Littlehampton Community School in west Sussex, says: \"It's fine for people to come up with these ideas but the problem is putting them into practice.\" He believes most schools will be expected to show they are doing something on community service, by encouraging pupils to participate in, say, the school council or a school improvement project. But it would be wrong for schools to be over-ambitious and not properly prepare volunteering schemes. He says: \"There's a scheme in west Sussex placing school pupils with charities for volunteering but it couldn't handle thousands of kids and that sort of scheme's not necessarily the way forward for the majority of kids.\" Another risk, believes CSV's Peter Hayes, is that as soon as something becomes statutory how do teachers handle pupils who refuse to take part? He says: \"You need to give the kids choices in a wider framework rather than ordering them to do a particular thing.\" Rather than limiting itself to volunteering CSV has chosen to focus on the wider citizenship agenda and participation in its work with schools, says Mr Hayes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
