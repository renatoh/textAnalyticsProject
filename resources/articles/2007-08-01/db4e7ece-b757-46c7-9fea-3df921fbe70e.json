As with other noted \"humanitarian interventions\" in Kosovo and Sierra Leone during the same period, Timor is seriously unfinished business - but no longer enjoys the political attention that briefly made it an international cause celebre. As a result, the nation-building agenda laid out after formal independence in 2002 remains as daunting as ever - and may yet fail. Internal factors are just as important. Timorese society is deeply divided, not least between the east, heartland of the pre-independence Fretilin movement's resistance to Indonesian rule, and western areas. Despite considerable potential oil and gas revenue, secured by a 2006 deal with Australia, most Timorese people remain desperately poor, with up to 80% unemployed. Language is another barrier: Tetum, the dominant local language, vies with Indonesian and Portuguese, now designated, oddly, as Timor's official tongue. The wounds of last year's army mutiny and the subsequent violence and political showdown have yet to heal. According to the UN, 15% of the roughly 1 million population was uprooted at the time and many remain so. This crisis formed the bitter backdrop to elections in June. Fretilin emerged with the most seats but forfeited power to a coalition led by former Falintil guerrilla leader, Xanana Gusmao. Mr Gusmao, East Timor's first president, was named prime minister last week by his sometime ally, current president Jos\u00e9 Ramos Horta. At his swearing-in ceremony, Mr Gusmao vowed to bridge the country's divisions: \"No political party, no institutional entity, no citizen will be excluded from the political process... The new government's first priority is to regain the confidence of the institutions of state.\" But Fretilin's leader, former prime minister Mari Alkatiri, declared the new government illegal and announced a parliamentary boycott. Although Mr Alkatiri condemned election-related violence, including attacks on UN personnel and Australian peacekeepers, the UN pinned the blame on Fretilin supporters. So far Fretilin has ignored appeals by NGOs and election observers to rejoin the political process. While Timor's troubles no longer directly concern Mr Blair and others who viewed their solution as integral to a new international order, they remain a cause for concern in Canberra, the leading bilateral aid donor. Australia also has about 1,000 troops in the country, part of the International Stabilisation Force supporting the UN mission, and there is little prospect of an early departure. Greg Sheridan, foreign editor of the newspaper The Australian, accused Fretilin of responsibility for the upheavals in a recent commentary: \"Its leaders say they are not ordering or even sanctioning violence. But these were Fretilin mobs that were rioting and Fretilin's leaders could have stopped the riots ... Fretilin is facing a Hamas-like moment. It must decide whether it is essentially an armed militia or a respectable political party.\" The insecurity was undermining attempts to attract foreign investment or develop job-creating industries such as tourism, Mr Sheridan added. Australia would have to stay engaged there for many years to come - or risk witnessing a civil war. There are other ways of looking at external involvement. East Timor's chronic dependence on military support, on an estimated $3bn in foreign aid in recent years, and on a series of UN missions (the fifth since 1999, Unmit, came last year) was a hot election issue, with many voters wondering what their hard-won sovereignty really means. According to Loro Horta, writing at openDemocracy.net, such worries point to a more fundamental dilemma: what he called \"the loss of trust by the people in its once near-mythical leaders\". Just as Fretilin was increasingly seen not as a national movement but as a party dominated by easterners, he argued that \"Xanana Gusmao himself - the once revered guerrilla leader and father of the nation, looked upon as a pillar of national unity and impartiality - has also suffered a significant demystification. \"Horta and Gusmao face the consequences of having made various deals and concessions in order to secure support ... They may remain the nation's most respected politicians. But some of their prestige has been severely dented.\" In short, the liberation's leaders are struggling to secure their achievement - while former international cheerleaders turn their backs and Indonesia, a giant neighbour with a long memory, watches quietly from across the 1999 border. If they fail, it is unclear who or what will follow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
