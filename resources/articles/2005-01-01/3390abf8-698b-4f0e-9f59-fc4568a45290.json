Surely this would be the opportunity to bargain with Labour regarding proportional representation so long sought by Lib Dems. Or does Kennedy think his party has progressed so far that he can look forward to the possibility of heading his very own elective dictatorship under first-past-the-post? Joe Patterson London So Charles Kennedy says \"there is no question of joining forces with the Conservatives\". This is reassuring, but what has he got to say about the alliance of Tories and Lib Dems (with Greens - even more shameful) that runs Leeds city council? Peter Gardiner Leeds I was surprised to read (Letters, January 22) that we in the UK have a right to live where we please. Presumably it doesn't extend to the travelling community. Graham Bradley Chepstow, Gwent It's good news that the music industry has control over those who download illegally (Music industry scuppers pirates, January 20). Perhaps it can now turn its attention to an equally pressing problem. I have around 200 vinyl LPs and I want to convert the tracks to MP3 format. I've already paid the licence fees, and don't want to pay twice. Moray Barclay Windsor, Berks There is also a great song by Morrissey called Piccadilly Palare, from the album Bona Drag (Letters, January 22), which contains the lines: \"So bona to vada, oh you your lovely eek and your lovely riah\". This roughly translates as \"Your lovely face and your lovely hair\". Alaric Dynevor Brentwood, Essex"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
