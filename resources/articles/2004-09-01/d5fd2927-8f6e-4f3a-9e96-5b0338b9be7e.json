The question was: who would he expect to stand up and lead the way out of the hole that had been dug for them by Team Europe. \"Tiger, of course,\" replied the US captain and left it at that. Later, when Lee Westwood heard of that exchange he was contemptuous. \"You know,\" he said, \"if Bernhard [Langer] had been asked that question, he would have said: 'All 12 of my team will lead.'\" That was a large part of the reason why Europe routed the Americans - not just in the four-balls and foursomes but in the singles too, the series in which the US traditionally fight back. Europe won by 18 points to 9, taking the singles 7 to 4 and establishing a record mark for any European team. They also equalled the margin set by the US when they won at Walton Heath in 1981 with a team that contained 11 men who were, or became, major championship winners. This European team had no major champions but was undoubtedly the strongest side ever put together on this side of the Atlantic. The Muirfield Village team of 1987 might have had six major winners but it deteriorated rapidly after that. This team was not only strong all the way down, they were all in form as well, although it has to be said that the margin of victory was something of a surprise. This was a team in every aspect of the word and, when the champagne came out after they had won, there was a childish delight among them at what they had achieved. Afterwards there was pride that everyone had gained at least a point and a quiet satisfaction that victory had been achieved with a team so young that many of its players can expect to go on and play six or more Ryder Cups. Sergio Garc\u00eda, at 24 playing in his third Ryder Cup, got 4 points; Luke Donald is 26, Paul Casey 27 and Ian Poulter 28. Furthermore there is 24-year-old Justin Rose waiting to regain form and Graeme McDowell, who almost made it this time, is only 25. Rapha\u00ebl Jacquelin and Fredrik Jacobson, both in contention this time round, are 30. There is a large pool of talent and it is going to get larger. Golf is expanding so rapidly throughout Europe the standard of play required just to get on the European tour is high. It led John O'Leary, a British Ryder Cup veteran from 1975, to comment after looking at the team lists for a foursomes: \"This is the first time I have been able to say that the four players we have had to leave out are better than the four the Americans have omitted.\" It was that realisation that enabled the European team, particularly its leaders in the shape of Garc\u00eda, Westwood, Darren Clarke and Colin Montgomerie to play relaxed golf, to let their games flow, in a manner that not even the likes of Woods or Phil Mickelson achieved. Those latter two, particularly when paired together on the first day, were noticeably tense. It was obvious that Woods, a control freak, did not enjoy having a player of Mickelson's calibre so close to him. Woods likes to be able to say, metaphorically: \"I make the jokes around here.\" David Toms put it graphically. He said: \"[The Europeans] play like they're going for a beer. We play like it's the only golf tournament in the world.\" Langer's captaincy was an enormous factor in the win. Paul McGinley put it well when he said: \"It's often said in books and so forth that, if you could put Jack Nicklaus's head on the shoulders of an average player, that player would become really good. Well, it's a little bit like that this week with Bernhard. We've gained a lot of benefit from his presence on the golf course. He's given us advice about course management and club selection and the pin positions all the way round.\" So Europe have now won four of the last five contests and kept the cup on seven of the past 10 competitions and the Americans are getting desperate. One thing they should do is to adopt the European method of deciding the automatic places, using a 12-month period instead of the current two years. Had they done that this time, Chris Riley, Kenny Perry, Toms and Fred Funk who got a total of 2 points between them, would not have made the team, having gathered most of their qualifying points in 2003. Instead they would have had, automatically, the Open champion Todd Hamilton, Steve Flesch, John Daly and Scott Verplank, all of them in form and with something to add to the team. As the players broke up late on Sunday night an American reporter, seeking to console Perry, who played only twice and lost both times, said: \"You know, the European dominance has to end some time.\" Perry, a man with a naturally mournful face anyway, replied: \"It may not. We may just keep on losing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
