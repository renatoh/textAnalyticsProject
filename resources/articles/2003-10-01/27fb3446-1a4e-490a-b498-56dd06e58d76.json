Not only were there spectators, 3,710 of them, but many were men. And they were queueing beyond kick-off time to get in. Unlike many clubs in the Premiership, Charlton have resisted the urge to tag women's matches on to the end of men's games in order to take advantage of a captive crowd, usually only to see it walk out at the earliest opportunity. Instead, vigorous promotion of top women's fixtures in their own right has yielded firmer fruit. And what tie more plum than the visit of Arsenal? For here were two teams who could not only cope with a broad, smooth pitch but treat it as an invitation while authentic crowd noise filled the air, booing yellow cards and cheering the vim and gristle of Charlton's tackling, as exemplified by Eartha Pond, whose opener pointed the Addicks towards a 2-1 victory. Even those ill-versed in women's affairs know that Arsenal have won everything there is to win - 17 trophies in as many years under the management of Vic Akers. So Charlton's victory not only kept them at the top of the table with eight straight wins but suggested a changing of the guard, too. \"They say they are the top name in women's football in this country, but people have got to start taking notice of us,\" Casey Stoney, the Charlton captain who scored the winner against her former team, said afterwards. \"Arsenal,\" Charlton's manager Keith Boanass added, \"have been a leading light in the past because the competition wasn't as stiff and he [Vic Akers] had the monopoly on the best players because no one else could match what they were offering.\" He is right that there is more parity these days, but much of it has been inspired by Akers' achievements. \"I thought about retiring last year,\" he said. \"But maybe this year we'll see the last of me.\" That really would be the end of an era."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
