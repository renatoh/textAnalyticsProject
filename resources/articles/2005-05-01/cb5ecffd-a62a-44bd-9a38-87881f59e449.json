In stage one, there was recognition that the prime minister was harming the brand but optimism that a post-Iraq relaunch would do the trick. That involved insisting to the punters that there was no alternative product on offer, so Gordon Brown was kept in the shadows. Once it became clear the merchandise wasn't shifting, the marketing team came up with a new strategy - a gradual phasing out of the Blair and a seamless phasing in of the Brown brand. This was \"buy a Blair get a Brown half-price\". Last week's debacle over Iraq meant that we have now entered phase three. Brown now has to prop up the prime minister at every opportunity and is crucial to the brand. To anyone watching the prime minister at bay on Question Time, it was clear that the Blair brand is toxic. Labour's approach for the final few days of the campaign is \"buy Brown and we'll throw Blair in free\". It should do the trick, but one thing's certain: we'll hear less of the chancellor failing to pull his weight for the party. He has played an absolute blinder. Blair sees this, no doubt, as hugely unfair, but that's life. The downside of politics in a consumer age is that consumers are always looking for something new. After 13 years of uninterrupted growth and falling unemployment life, for most, has become a lot more comfortable. What Labour fears is that contentment has bred complacency; voters perceive prosperity as the natural order of things and decide that it will continue no matter who is minding the shop. Labour will spend the last few days of campaigning trying to persuade people that there is a danger in complacency, with Brown imparting two simple messages: the economy is safe in his hands; and that he can be trusted even if Blair can't be. Default The Tories, for their part, are making the case that the good times preceded the arrival of Labour in power by at least four years and would persist if Michael Howard took over. They are making that case by default, since the economy has barely featured in their campaign. That's a surprise, not only because the economy used to be the Tories' unique selling point, but also because economic news during the campaign has been nothing to write home about. Labour finds the sullen mood among the electorate galling. After all, it says, haven't we boosted the living standards of the working poor through tax credits? Haven't we pumped billions into regeneration projects and the New Deal? Isn't it the case that the past few years have seen the biggest sustained increase in spending on the NHS since it was founded? It drives Labour wild with frustration to hear that politicians are all the same and that it doesn't matter which lot you vote for. Voters may prove to be more grateful for Labour's social spending than they are letting on, but if not the search will start on Friday for explanations. The simplest is that it is all down to Iraq, though the sense of disengagement appears to be prevalent even among those who supported the war. Another possibility is that consumers have grown more demanding. In the past eight years they have enjoyed huge increases in value for money when it comes to computers, mobile phones and DVDs; the price of clothes is lower, in nominal terms, than it was in the late 1980s. We are used to getting more for less in the shops, so the fact that public services have improved since 1997 as well is seen as no big deal. So they should, the electorate says, given all the money that has been poured into them. One final explanation is that voters are now political consumers and have decided there really isn't much to choose between the brands. Instead of a sharply differentiated choice there is now a post-Thatcherite consensus which has synthesised ideas from both right and left into a broadly agreed platform that all governments now support. So, in economic policy we find that there is agreement on the need for an independent central bank, an inflation target, fiscal rules, investment in human capital, the minimum wage, the private finance initiative, free trade and, de facto, opposition to joining the euro. Neither party has time for nationalisation, industrial policy (other than tax breaks for R&amp;D spending) or protectionism. When Rover went bust, the message from both parties was: \"We feel your pain but that's capitalism for you. How about some retraining?\" Labour has dragged the Tories on to its ground over public spending - both parties would be spending more at the end of the next parliament than Labour is now - and international development. The Tories have forced the pace on crime, where being tough on crime means prison numbers are at record levels, and immigration. Omission Both parties support outsourcing, free movement of capital, the Iraq war, building more roads and airports. Neither has said a word to suggest that they take seriously the threat of climate change because both parties are wedded to the idea that more growth equals success. The environment is the most glaring omission from the campaign but not the only one. Pensions, the council tax, the European constitution, whether to replace ageing nuclear power stations, a possible replacement for Trident and Britain's attitude towards Iraq have all been put in a box labelled \"too difficult\". These are issues that are almost certain to prove contentious so they are not being talked about by the larger parties. So where does that leave us? The clustering together of the political parties has given the 2005 election more of an American feel than ever before, with the large areas of agreement disguised by negativity and the viciousness of the campaigning. Labour's claim that this is all the fault of the Tories is entirely bogus; it set the tone early on when it fitted up Howard Flight. None of this is to say that voting doesn't matter or that there is no difference between the parties. But the end of political ideology and the rise of managerialism has come at a price: the parties have to spend large sums of money seeking to differentiate their product, using the full array of modern marketing and advertising techniques. The point about oligopolistic markets though, is that the product is broadly similar. Consumers have been emancipated, but most of them feel no more passionate about their political party than they do about their supermarket. When it comes to the weekly shop, Waitrose means shorter queues and higher prices while Morrisons means longer queues and lower prices. When it comes to the election, Labour means slightly higher tax and slightly higher spending while the Conservatives mean slightly lower spending and slightly lower tax. That at least is what the voters think. Reality, of course, might be a little more complicated. larry.elliott@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
