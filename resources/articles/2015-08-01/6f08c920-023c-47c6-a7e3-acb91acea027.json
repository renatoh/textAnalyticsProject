The Argentinian has been given a chance to stake a claim after David de Gea was dropped from the side because of his uncertain future. Yet despite this impressive start Romero is keen to better his game. \u201cThe manager is asking different things like playing with my feet and always be a passing option for my team-mates,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to adapt and get better. I try to work to help my team-mates. If I have to try to block crosses, I will. If I have to save shots from goal, I will. \u201cThings started great. The team is responding to the demands. We started one goal behind [against Bruges] and we could recover. We need to keep growing because this is a team under construction. I am sure we will see the best version of this team.\u201d V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s is also out of favour under Van Gaal, the manager having left him out of the summer tour because of questions over the Spanish goalkeeper\u2019s attitude. \u201cUnited have two top-level goalkeepers in them,\u201d said Romero. \u201cThey have won everything. David in this club because he has played more time than V\u00edctor here, but Vald\u00e9s has won everything in Barclelona. It\u2019s a joy to work with them in this club and share moments with them.\u201d Romero is a countryman of Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, who is expected to join Manchester City. \u201cHe is a great defender, but above all he is a great person,\u201d the goalkeeper said. \u201cThat\u2019s a superior value to what somebody can be as a footballer. As a person, he is really great.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
