Yet last month the Imperial War Museum announced it was sending three artists to Afghanistan to reflect the experience of modern warfare. One of them, photographer Paul Seawright, said he would \"avoid militaristic images\" and concentrate instead on displaced communities and mine-clearance work. The themes of conflict and war have inspired artists throughout the ages - think of the scenes on the Parthenon Marbles, Picasso's Guernica, or Goya's Disasters of War. War artists give us the opportunity for reflection, interpretation, and a look beyond the spin doctors' version of warfare. This week, some of the UK's finest, but least known, war paintings go on public display at the London Original Print Fair. The exhibition, entitled Reflecting on War, will display works taken from the Imperial War Museum's collection. The images range from ones of patriotism and military glory to those of pure horror. The museum collects both historic and contemporary artists' prints: recent acquisitions include works by Colin Self, Hellmuth Weisenborn and Walid Siti. The Original Print Fair, now in its 17th year, is the only art fair held at the Royal Academy of Arts. This year, 30 international dealers will be offering work from the 15th to the 21st century. \"Original print\" might seem an oxymoron, but prints offer art lovers the opportunity to buy an original work of art at an affordable price. \"Buying newly published prints provides a good opportunity for collectors to buy work by both well known and less known artists at the optimum price,\" explained a spokeswoman. Plus, you might find that you've made a shrewd investment - \"the resale value nearly always exceeds the original price.\" A new screenprint by Bridget Riley and works by Lucian Freud and David Hockney are some of the more recent highlights this year, while those in search of something a little older will find prints by the likes of Durer, Rembrandt and Goya. \u00b7 Reflecting on Conflict: Prints from the Imperial War Museum is at the Small South Room at the Royal Academy of Arts, May 2 - 5 2002. The London Original Print Fair is from May 2 - 5 at the Royal Academy of Arts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
