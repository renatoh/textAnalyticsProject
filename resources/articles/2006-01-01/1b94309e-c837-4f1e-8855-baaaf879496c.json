The Home Office said when people smuggling scams were uncovered, the illegal immigrants could be handed special residence permits. Ministers also said they were also considering offering victims permission to stay in the UK temporarily while they decide whether to help prosecute traffickers, by offering an automatic \"reflection period\". The home secretary, Charles Clarke, said he thought the problem was \"very serious indeed\", bracketing it with drug dealing. \"They're international in character, they're run by international criminal conspiracies which seek to bypass national legislation and they operate in the most cynical and unpleasant way. \"We've seen tragedies like the cockle-pickers in Morecambe Bay, like the Chinese who were being transported across the Channel and died in a container lorry,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"There are also many other cases of people working in completely unacceptable circumstances and women and children being abused appallingly.\" He said many people being trafficked into this country should be regarded as \"victims of crime\". Currently, the cases of trafficking victims - often forced to work as prostitutes against their will - are decided on a case-by-case basis and there is no right to stay in Britain. The consultation paper published today warned the measures could attract immigrants to the UK. \"They could be misused by individuals seeking to extend their stay in the UK, where they do not have a genuine claim as a victim of trafficking,\" it said. \"Dealing with fraudulent applications will slow down our ability to respond to genuine claims.\" The moves would cover all forms of human trafficking, including labour exploitation as well as sexual exploitation. \"Human trafficking, often for the purpose of sexual exploitation or forced labour, is an appalling crime and amounts to modern day slavery,\" said the Home Office minister, Paul Goggins. \"It causes great harm, not just to the victims, but to our society as a whole. The government is determined to tackle this terrible crime and reduce the harm it causes.\" He later said that men who use prostitutes forced into the sex trade by people-traffickers were committing rape. \"Men should be aware that many of these women have been forced to come here against their will to work in the sex trade,\" he told the Mirror. \"If they are having sex without their permission, there's no other word for it - it's rape.\" The Liberal Democrat human rights spokesman, Evan Harris, said: \"There is no evidence of any 'pull factor' on immigration from other countries like Italy, Belgium and Holland which do provide reflection periods for victims and the possibility of residence if they co-operate with prosecutions of the vicious criminals behind the trade. \"It is a sad indictment of this government's priorities that they see the rape and brutalisation of foreign women in this country as an issue of border controls and not human rights.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
