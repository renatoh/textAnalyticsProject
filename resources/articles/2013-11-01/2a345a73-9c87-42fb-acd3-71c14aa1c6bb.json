The entire plant is being decommissioned, a clean-up they reckon could take 40 years. After a disaster of these proportions, when three reactors suffered meltdowns after being hit by a giant tsunami, nothing its operator does or says today is taken at face value in Japan. The ability of the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) to handle the build-up of toxic water used to contain the melted cores is being questioned as never before, after a string of water and radiation leaks and one incident in which six men were doused with contaminated water. The embattled company faces plummeting morale, a shortage of skilled labour, insufficient funds \u2013 all exacerbated, according to some, by a refusal to accept outside help. For all this, it is worth reading what Naomi Hirose, Tepco's latest president, had to say in an interview with the Guardian. What happened at Fukushima, he said, was a lesson to the world: \"Try to examine all the possibilities no matter how small they are, and don't think any single counter-measure is foolproof.\" In hindsight, one tiny detail, such as waterproof seals on doors, would have saved everything. Is the unthinkable being thought as Britain plans for a new generation of reactors? Fukushima prompted the UK's Office for Nuclear Regulation to conduct a safety review in which Mike Weightman, its chief inspector, concluded there were no fundamental safety weaknesses, although his report identified 38 areas for improvement. Is the review, as the independent nuclear analyst John Large maintains, a whitewash? Would UK reactors, as he contends, not survive an hour without power? Documents released under freedom of information rules showed that all eight coastal nuclear locations in the UK, including Hinkley Point, were at risk of flooding and coastal erosion, which would worsen with climate change. The point here is not whether we need nuclear power. It is whether the nuclear industry in Britain is learning from disasters. Is it coming clean about all the risks associated with the venture? The pressure to produce the answer that confirms the consensus view is intense. Fukushima prompted Japan to close all 50 nuclear power plants. Little surprise that at the UN climate talks in Warsaw, Japan, which is the world's fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gas, slashed plans to reduce emissions from 25% to 3.8% on 2005 figures. Hiroshi Minami, Japan's chief negotiator, said that with no nuclear power, Japan has to lower its \"ambition level\" on greenhouse gases. In the short term, Japan is trapped, as are we all, in a vicious circle of greenhouse gas dependency and worsening climate change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
