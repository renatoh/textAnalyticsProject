The London trio of singer Sian Ahern and multi-instrumentalist music-industry veterans Rupert Clervaux and Ben Crook have been gaining a name as proteges of Spiritualized, whom they recently supported and whose influence is all over their ethereal debut album, 59:59. The album is a gentle affair, a sedate drift of strings and atmospheric keyboards, but live, the band are a far more rock'n'roll concern. Augmented to a six-piece by a slew of musicians including the former Jesus and Mary Chain bassist Douglas Hart, they power out repetitive, crashing riffs whose inscrutable minimalism turns every rudimentary number into a majestic mantra. Ahern, pale and interesting beneath her raven fringe, is the kind of quasi-gothic siren that adorned arty independent record label 4AD's roster circa 1987. A slight, frail figure who looks as if she could just as easily be supporting Laura Marling at a local folk club, she closes her eyes and appears positively rapt amid the seismic din of the primal noise assault of Way Down to Heaven. In truth, Sian Alice Group are less reminiscent of Spiritualized than of Spacemen 3, the Velvets/Stooges-fixated parent group that Jason Pierce played in long before he hired string sections and gospel choirs. Tonight, Ahern and cohorts grind through a mere 20 minutes before exiting. Their influences are obvious and synthesis skilful; the question is whether they can find anywhere new to take this hypnotic music. \u00b7 At Mandela Hall, Belfast, tonight. Box office: 028 9097 1062. Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
