Amid speculation that the election result will not be immediately known and signs Republicans will either declare victory early or mount legal challenges if Donald Trump appears to have lost, multiple news outlets reported the White House plan, citing anonymous sources. \u201cThe White House on lockdown,\u201d the NBC News White House correspondent, Geoff Bennett, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cA federal law enforcement source tells NBC that beginning tomorrow, crews will build a \u2018non-scalable\u2019 fence to secure the [White House] complex, Ellipse and Lafayette Square. Two hundred and fifty national guardsmen have been put on standby, reporting to metro police officials.\u201d The barricade will form a square perimeter around the White House, on 15th Street, Constitution Avenue, 17th Street and H street. Fencing was put up during the summer, amid national protests against police brutality and systemic racism in the aftermath of the killing by Minneapolis police of George Floyd, an African American man. According to CNN, the new \u201cunscalable\u201d barricade is the same type of fence. In the summer, amid protests near the White House at which federal agents confronted and assaulted mostly peaceful demonstrators, it was reported that Trump was taken to a protective bunker under the executive mansion. Trump insisted the visit was brief and for inspection purposes. The summer protests also saw confrontations between law enforcement and protesters, and widespread looting, in other major cities. As the election looms, stores in New York, Washington and elsewhere have been boarding up windows in case of trouble. Across the capital, people were bracing for unrest regardless of the election result. Business owners boarded up windows, while George Washington University warned students and staff to stock up on at least one week\u2019s worth of \u201cfood, supplies and medicine\u201d. Law enforcement agencies are preparing to deploy. Patrick Burke, executive director of the Washington DC Police Foundation, recently told CNN: \u201cIf there\u2019s no winner, you will see significant deployments of officers at all levels across the capital.\u201d The Daily Beast also reported that more than 100 personnel from the justice department\u2019s Bureau of Prisons are prepared to mobilize in case of unrest. In New York, the police commissioner, Dermot Shea, sent a memo to department members in mid-October, indicating that the majority of officers must report to duty in uniform \u2013 and be ready to deploy, including officers not normally in uniform, including detectives. The department said it expected protests could become larger and more frequent into early 2021, NBC New York reported. The NYPD has told businesses in midtown Manhattan to ramp up security in the event of mass protests, according to the Wall Street Journal. There and elsewhere in New York City, such as the SoHo shopping district downtown, windows were smashed and stores were looted this summer. Curbed noted that other cities, including San Francisco and Washington, saw businesses boarding up windows as a protective measure. State governors, including in Massachusetts, Arizona and Oregon, have asked the national guard to prepare for deployment in case of unrest and protests surrounding the election. More than 3,600 troops have been activated, the Military Times reports."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
