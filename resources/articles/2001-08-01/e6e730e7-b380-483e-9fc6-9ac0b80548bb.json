This kind of autobiographical storytelling theatre is fiendishly difficult to pull off without appearing self-indulgent, and Jones's tale of how he ended up on the cutting-room floor isn't multilayered enough to be compelling. The gimmick is that Jones's story is brought to life by what is known in the film business as a Foley artist, someone who rubs gloves together to mimic the rustle of pigeon wings, squelches corn on the cob to represent the sound of fist on face and scrunches up crisp packets for the sound of armies annexing small countries. This is all amusing enough, and if it were half the length would be an entertaining and unique titbit. \"You really made something out of nothing,\" declares the director of Notting Hill after Jones has shot his scene. He certainly does, but in the theatre that is not quite enough. \u0095 Until August 25. Box office: 0131-228 1404. Traverse"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
