Deloitte and Touche, the administrators, did not name the interested party but stressed it was not a ploy to raise the asking price for City after it was discovered the club's debts were almost \u00a320m more than the original \u00a330m estimate. \"Nick Dargan [the administrator] would not have made this second expression of interest public if he thought it was in any way mischievous,\" said a spokeswoman. \"He sees this as credible and a serious enough submission by an interested party. \"At the end of the day it is likely that it is the biggest financial offer for the club which is accepted, subject to it being financially viable.\" That offer may have to be substantially more than the \u00a35m Lineker's five-strong consortium anticipated paying following the revelation that City's debts are not \u00a330m but more than \u00a350m. Lineker's consortium has already raised half its original target but Greg Clarke, one of the quintet and chairman of Leicester City plc, has said it will not become involved in an auction for the club. \"It's Nick Dargan's job to maximise the price he gets for the club,\" said Clarke. \"He's very skilled at his job but we will only offer what we can afford to pay for the club. And if interest from elsewhere is genuine then we welcome it - as long as it is in the best interests of Leicester City. Warren Barton last night revealed that Derby County's players are ready to take a further 25% pay-cut to help ease the club's financial plight. The players held initial talks with the board yesterday and made it clear they are ready to co-operate to save the club - despite taking a 20% cut at the end of last season because of the club's relegation from the Premiership. Non-playing staff have already agreed to a cut, with voluntary redundancies offered to administrative staff to slash the club's wage bill and ease the pressures of \u00a330m debts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
