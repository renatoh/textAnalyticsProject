If the role of British ministers in making every key EU decision is hidden from the British people by a secretive and ineffective Commons scrutiny system, then it is not surprising that the British feel that the EU is disconnected and bureaucratic. Brussels is \"them\" who do things to \"us\". EU law is often presented as alien even by the ministers who agreed it. The result of such unwholesome practices is that British public opinion is the most Eurosceptic in the EU. Fewer of us think that there are benefits to our membership than other Europeans. More of us think that the EU is undemocratic. More of us want to withdraw than in any other member state. Ukip's rise has given us the largest party committed to exit in any of the 25 member states. The reasons for this festering hostility to the EU lie mainly in Britain, not Brussels. Certainly, the EU does stupid things. But most of the 450 million European citizens are wise enough to know that a set of institutions that delivers peace, prosperity and the power to tackle cross-border problems such as pollution is not going to be perfect. The calculus, comparing the past 50 years with any previous 50 years of European history, is overwhelmingly positive. The real problem is that successive British governments have failed to make it clear that no major EU decision is taken without British ministers participating, and generally agreeing. The most sensitive issues - such as tax - require unanimity. Even when issues are agreed by majority, Britain is outvoted less often than any other major member state. We win from majority voting. But would we know it? British MPs often react like scalded cats when they discover that some EU directive has been agreed by ministers and MEPs, and is all over bar the shouting. Once a minister has signed off a directive in Brussels, and it is approved by the European parliament, the UK is committed to implementing its objectives, usually by means of a statutory instrument which requires no Commons debate. We are then even more surprised when Whitehall implements the directive adding items from its own agenda: so-called \"gold-plating\". The reason for our ignorance is the woeful inadequacy of the Commons' scrutiny of EU matters. Despite dealing with some 12 directives since 1999, there was not a single occasion on which the scrutiny committee either called me to give evidence or sent me its views. The Commons scrutiny committee meets in secret with a procedure that essentially involves sifting the paperwork that spews from the EU commission. Not surprisingly, it is swamped. Nor is this record compensated by greater activity on the backbenches. In a recent survey of written parliamentary questions, my colleague Chris Davies MEP found that a mere 79 questions out of 40,000 put down during one session concerned British ministers' attitudes in the council of ministers. There were 92 council meetings, each attended by a British minister, during that time. This failure to hold ministers to account has an unintended consequence. Because ministers know that there is no political downside in agreeing EU directives and regulations, they often delegate negotiations to British officials. A Brussels bureaucracy is met by a British one. Issues that should properly be political - because they involve values, and have political consequences - are never lifted to a political level except in the European parliament, where MEPs do not have the same profile as ministers. The Nordic countries have shown there is a much better way. Another Eurosceptic country, Denmark, pioneered the idea of examining Danish ministers before they went to each council meeting. Ministers are even given a rigid negotiating mandate. Danish scrutiny is high profile, public and unrelenting. As a result, the Danish Folketing - and the Danes - are forewarned and forearmed. The Danish system has its faults. Danish ministers can be so tied down that other ministers do not find it worthwhile negotiating with them, as they know they have no flexibility beyond their public position. The best model is the Finnish Eduskunta. Its grand committee of senior parliamentarians takes evidence before each ministerial meeting. It allows ministers to interpret a mandate flexibly. It can also, crucially, call for specialist evidence from its select committees. One of the great myths of Brussels is that you need to be a Brussels specialist to understand it. In fact, the core expertise in scrutinising a law on abattoirs is an understanding of abattoirs, not of Brussels procedures. And such expertise is more likely in a select committee than the foreign affairs committee. EU law is domestic, not a branch of foreign policy. Will it happen here? Peter Hain, the leader of the House of Commons, shows some signs of rising to the challenge. He - and perhaps the modernisation committee that he chairs - is beginning to realise the connection between the lack of Commons scrutiny and Euroscepticism. He has proposed a grand committee, meeting in public. So far, so good. The problem is that he has proposed that it meet just twice or four times a year. By contrast, the Nordic grand committees meet almost weekly, so that they can take evidence from ministers before every EU council. That is the guarantee that they are well-informed, and examine the issues before decisions are taken rather than succumb to shock afterwards. If the modernisation committee is to do more than genuflect to the need for EU scrutiny, it needs to face the far greater time commitment required of some MPs. Let us hope that it does, for our EU membership may depend on it. \u00b7 Chris Huhne, a Liberal Democrat MEP, recently gave evidence on EU scrutiny to the Commons modernisation committee. chuhne@europarl.eu.int"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
