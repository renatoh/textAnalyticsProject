The Spell and Go promotion, which featured TV adverts presented by Gary Lineker, had participants taking codes printed on promotional packets of crisps and entering them on a website to gain letters that would help them spell out holiday destinations. A completed name of a destination would result in a holiday. But customers took to social media to complain that it seemed impossible to get the letters C, D or K to complete the names of some of the places. More than 100 people complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that the competition withheld certain letters. Defending the promotion, Walkers said all 26 destinations included at least one of the letters C, D or K \u2013 known as type one letters \u2013 and the company had ensured enough of these were in circulation to allow for 20,000 holidays to be won. The company said 796 families had won four-star, seven-night holidays worth more than \u00a31.35m. Following the complaints, the ASA said it was satisfied a small proportion of the total number of letters in circulation were type one letters. However, the watchdog was not satisfied with another part of the competition, the \u201crandom swap\u201d function, which allowed participants to swap letters within a \u201cpool\u201d on the competition\u2019s website, which stated \u201call letters are treated equally\u201d. The ASA discovered that C, D or K could not be won in the pool. The ASA said the omission was \u201cmisleading and likely to cause unnecessary disappointment to consumers\u201d. A Walkers spokeswoman said: \u201cWe welcome the ASA\u2019s recognition that our Spell and Go promotion was fair as everyone who participated had an equal chance of winning one of the 20,000 holidays available. \u201cWe are aware some customers are disappointed that they have not been successful in winning a holiday; 20,000 holidays could have been won if all the promotional packs in the market had been played and we would have honoured all of those should that have been the case.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
