The A686 at Hartside and the A66 between Penrith and Scotch Corner have been closed. Motorists are being urged not to travel in the areas affected this weekend. Chief Inspector Graham Rankin, of Durham police, said there were \"substantial snow drifts\" but there had only been \"minor\" accidents so far. The main concern was \"to get [the motorists] somewhere safe\", he said. \"Local officers will be sorting out arrangements for the night,\" he told BBC News 24. He estimated 200 people had been trapped in more than 150 vehicles, with 40 of those said to be elderly people. A group of 15 schoolchildren were also rescued from the A66. Many were being ferried to Bowes to seek refuge in a pub and community hall. Superintendent Graham Hall from Durham police said the majority of travellers had been successfully evacuated in 4x4 vehicles. A mountain rescue team was also called in to assist the operation. \"It is treacherous conditions,\" Hall told Sky News. \"It is icy roads. We clearly have heavy snowfalls and possible drifting. If at all possible stay at home.\" The snow storms hit the area at around 2pm. The Met Office said the winds would gradually ease but roads in the north-east and Yorkshire would remain icy overnight and into Saturday morning. The Highways Agency said drivers should bring warm clothing and an emergency pack including food, water boots and a torch. Several lorries were stuck in large snowdrifts on the A9, near Inverness, following last night's blizzards. Meanwhile, strong winds were thought to have contributed to the collapse of a blazing building in Lanarkshire early this morning. The collapse injured two people. Strathclyde Fire and Rescue said one firefighter suffered suspected fractures to both legs and another a fracture to one leg when the structure came down at 4.25am. The Forth Road bridge, the Skye bridge and the Erskine bridge were all closed to high-sided vehicles, and several roads around Aberdeenshire were shut due to heavy snows. \"Where possible, motorists should postpone car journeys until the weather clears, but those who do need to be out on the roads may find they need to cope with weather-related hazards,\" an AA statement said. \"Decreased visibility is one of those, so make sure you de-mist before you set off.\" Road gritting vehicles were out in force overnight in Scotland and northern England to prepare for the expected snowfall. Early yesterday, a 45-year-old man died when his lorry was swept into the central reservation of the M6 motorway in Tebay, Cumbria. Nine vehicles overturned in high winds between junctions 36 and 44 of the same motorway. Meanwhile, weather statistics revealed that this January was the wettest since 1995, with only seven wetter Januarys in the past 100 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
