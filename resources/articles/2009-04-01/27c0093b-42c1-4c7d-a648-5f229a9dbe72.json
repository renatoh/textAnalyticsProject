But with the Big Four all faced with seemingly straightforward domestic outings, the spotlight instead falls on those sides struggling at the other end of the table. Eight clubs are quoted at 10\u20131 or shorter to be relegated with just seven games to go, with arguably any team in the bottom half of the table under threat. And with six of the bottom eight sides facing each other on Saturday, this weekend could be pivotal in the battle to retain Premier League status. The situation is far from what had been anticipated at the start of the season when the three promoted teams were all given odds-on quotes from the layers to go back down. Paddy Power, in fact, were so convinced Stoke City were destined for the Championship following their 3\u20131 opening day defeat to Bolton Wanderers, they paid out to punters who had backed Tony Pulis' side to be relegated. Seven months on and only West Bromwich Albion look doomed. Tony Mowbray's side are best at 1-25 (Ladbrokes) to be relegated and 33-1 (Sky Bet) to stay up \u2013 odds that give a small arbitrage opportunity. No one will get rich backing them for the drop now but a sell of their total points at 30 (extrabet.com and Sporting Index) could reap some reward. With only three home games remaining \u2013 and one of those against title-chasing Liverpool \u2013 the trade appears to have little downside. After West Brom, Middlesbrough are quoted at 3-10 (Coral) to go down, Newcastle United evens (Blue Square), Hull City 3\u20131 (Stan James), Sunderland 7-2 (general), Stoke 15-2, Portsmouth 17-2 (both extrabet.com) and Blackburn Rovers 10-1 (general). Punters, and fans of all the relegation-threatened teams, have been busy calculating just how many points each club are likely to gain over the next seven weeks and whether that will be enough for remain in the Premier League. Pundits will have you believe that 40 is the magical figure teams need for safety (and Paddy Power offer 9-2 exactly that figure is enough) but according to Sky Bet 38 is the total teams should aim for. They go 8-11 that the club finishing 17th amasses 38 points or fewer with evens available that it is more than that total.Alan Shearer's much trumpeted arrival at St James' Park saw a flurry of cash from Tyneside punters for Newcastle to stay up but their 2-0 defeat by Chelsea last weekend saw the their odds for survival lengthen from 4-6 to evens (general). And with four away games remaining for Newcastle \u2013 including a tough fixture on Saturday at Stoke \u2013 anyone believing they will stay up might be best advised to wait until after this weekend to get financially involved. Anything but a win at the Britannia Stadium would see their price drift further and an odds-against quote might look attractive given Newcastle still have home games against Portsmouth, Middlesbrough and Fulham to come. Pessimistic Geordies should take Sky Bet's offer of 8-1 that Newcastle win next season's Championship. Should they be relegated they are unlikely to be any bigger than 5-1. Newcastle are not the only north-east club under threat, of course, and although there is little value in backing Middlesbrough for the drop at current odds (congratulations to the extrabet.com customer who staked \u00a31,000 at 15-2 in August that Gareth Southgate's side would be relegated though), Sunderland at 7-2, look a fair wager. Only one of their remaining four home games (against Manchester United, Hull, Everton and Chelsea) looks particularly winnable while only West Brom and Aston Villa have performed worse than the Black Cats over the last six matches. It is more than possible that two north-east clubs will be relegated, with Sky Bet offering 8-11 that any two of three will end up playing Championship football next season (and 12-1 all three go down). And while that quote looks a little skinny, there is perhaps a smidgeon of value to be had in backing the 5-6 (Sky Bet) on offer no north-east team finishes the season with 40 points or more. Sunderland, as mentioned, look a value punt to go down while it's difficult to see Newcastle and Boro picking up 11 and 13 points respectively from their remaining seven matches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
