Spurs go to Arsenal in the Carabao Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, two and a half weeks after the league meeting there which led to one supporter being charged by the Metropolitan police and banned by Tottenham for throwing a banana skin at Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The fan has said it was not a racist act. Pochettino said they have a responsibility to keep their support positive. \u201cOur fans, Arsenal fans, Chelsea fans, around the world \u2013 we need to celebrate for us,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it is Arsenal fans, Argentina fans, Tottenham fans, Espanyol or Barcelona fans \u2013 I am against this type of situation. \u201cFor me it [racism] is the worst thing in the world and that is why I am completely against this behaviour. I don\u2019t want to be populist \u2013 I don\u2019t care whether it is our fans or other fans, I want to kill [the bad behaviour and racism]. For me it is like this. Our responsibility is to behave like this.\u201d After that game, which Spurs lost 4-2, the Arsenal team caused some irritation by posting on social media extensive celebratory pictures from the dressing room. \u201cIt\u2019s normal \u2013 when we won, we put selfies of ourselves too,\u201d he said, suggesting Tottenham do it in a more understated fashion. \u201cOf course it hurt a little bit because it\u2019s a derby, but if we win we\u2019re going to do the same [as we normally do]. They want to show their fans their happiness, but that is fair enough.\u201d Pochettino was speaking after Tottenham, clearly weary after their draw at Barcelona, laboured to a 1-0 win over Burnley on Saturday. \u201cYou have a bit less energy, you play with less intensity,\u201d said Hugo Lloris. \u201cI think we made a good performance \u2013 not fantastic, but really professional.\u201d The three points kept them in third place and in touch with Liverpool and Manchester City at the top. In touch with the title race, perhaps. \u201cIn football you can win by scoring in the first minute or the last minute; the victory is the same,\u201d the manager added. \u201cWe showed real character, belief. Our physical character was so strong. We won with other players [Pochettino made a number of changes to his team] but we keep the same attitude of the team. When you feel that the team manages all the circumstances or problems, you start to feel that you are really a team that is going to fight for big things.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
