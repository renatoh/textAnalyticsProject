Matthew Sweet led the boosting last week, with his article challenging the received wisdom that postwar British cinema \u2013 exemplified by the work of Ealing Studios \u2013 was cosy and parochial. No, he said: in the US, British films were valued because they were so daring. (A point echoed by badcat: \"As an American, I'm very envious of those witty, sly, dry Ealing comedies. The post-WWII Hollywood products are cloying and smug in contrast. Try the emetic Father of the Bride or the obsessively perky MGM musicals, or those awful westerns, all regarded as classics. No wonder our US baby boomers grew up thinking that they were the centre of the world and its first real generation.\") \"I blame Truffaut and his anti-English/British bias,\" said caroassassino. \"Powell and Pressburger's films are superior to anything that he ever directed. Peeping Tom is much more dangerous than Day for Night, for instance, while I would take The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp over the Antoine Doinel cycle any day.\" The thread continued in similar vein until antonysn arrived, fedora brim pulled down, cigarette smoke curling from the corner of his mouth (well, that's how I like to imagine him), to smack some goddamn sense into everyone: \"I would say I'm sorry to interrupt this parochial backslapping, but this is heinous rubbish. Compare a handful of dry, sweet British postwar movies to \u2026 well, two words \u2013 American noir, inspired by European film-makers not from Britain. Which produced an entire canon of heroes without a moral compass \u2026 We had Alec Guinness. They had Mitchum and Bogart. Live with it.\" Manufactured pop stars do rile some people. Caroline Sullivan wrote about Selena Gomez, the latest singer to follow Hilary Duff and Miley Cyrus off the Disney production line \u2013 and clearly regarded as an enemy of all that is good and decent by many readers. \"Selena Gomez is a pleasant, bland, programmed 'pop star',\" wrote VeronikaLarsson. I listened to Selena as a guest DJ on a radio station and she was quite smooth, no awkward bumps at all \u2013 a professional through and through. The only problem was, listening to Selena sing, or DJ, or watching her perform, is like watching a circus pony who is being put through his paces. It's exciting for little kids, but adults just yawn.\" That was one of the nicer comments. KenBarlow didn't pussyfoot around: \"So many adults now work so very, very hard to extract so much money from so many young people. This is what maybe happens in post-industrial societies as career-orientated, driven adults seek to ensure their own comfort and security in the world. This is the way the world ends \u2013 buried under a mountain of tween jailbait-themed lunchboxes.\" Nor did philstyle: \"So, another glamorous concoction of minced meat and intestinal casing gets squeezed out of the pop machine for the next batch of eight to 13-year-olds to worship.\" Intestinal casing? Do you think that might be a little bit harsh? Or are you requesting an article on sausage manufacture? Coming to Gomez's defence was SV80, who argued that she has \"much more personality than any of her Disney peers and a half-decent session rock group to back her up\". Later in the thread, SV returned to the theme, comparing Gomez to Cyrus, in the light of the latter's single See You Again: \"I don't think Gomez has anything quite as exceptional but Cyrus has never come close to releasing such a consistent album.\" The new record, however, \"seems really patchy on first listen. Dices is good, though, and I really like Love You Like a Love Song. There's a strange mismatch on the latter between the lyrics and the slightly weary tone she takes. Musically, it rather reminds me of Russian singer Tatiana Bulanova's Belaya-Cheremuha, which is a fantastic song.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
