The champions' January transfer activity, Willo Flood arriving for a nominal fee from Cardiff City, prompted some supporters to bemoan a lack of investment in Gordon Strachan's squad. Celtic revealed half-year profits of \u00a38.36m with turnover increased by 10% to \u00a346.78m. Their bank debt has also been reduced to less than \u00a31m but Lawwell says such figures do not overshadow Strachan's on-field work, which includes a \u00a37m outlay on players last summer. \"What frustrates us is that we are sometimes accused of holding the balance sheet up as a trophy at the expense of football but that is nonsense,\" said Lawwell. \"We have won three championships in a row, four out of five in my time as chief executive, and six from the last eight. \"Nobody was more frustrated than us about not bringing more players in during January. We had the resources to do so; it was all down to unavailability of players. Down south Liverpool did next to nothing either and Chelsea only brought a loan player in from Internazionale at the last minute. Only Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur were really active.\" Lawwell concedes salaries and transfer fees south of the border mean his club is in a different market from five years ago. \"What we have seen is rapid inflation from the big five football nations and that has been led by England,\" he said. \"In the past we could afford English Premier League players and pay their wages but what has happened is that \u00a335,000-\u00a340,000-a-week wages are now \u00a380,000-\u00a390,000. \"We brought Craig Bellamy here on loan in January 2005, paying his Premier League wage and a loan fee. In January 2009, he cost \u00a316m and earns a multiple of that salary.\" While warning matters will only change if there is an \"implosion in England linked to television deals,\" Lawwell has no fears Strachan may be coaxed by a more lucrative offer from elsewhere. \"We would rather have a manager who is attractive to other clubs because of the fantastic job he has done here than one who is not,\" he said. \"But everything is fine with Gordon, there is absolutely no indication he wants to go elsewhere.\" Having been eliminated from the Champions League at the group phase, Celtic's chairman, Dr John Reid, has warned that end-of -year financial results in light of elimination from the Champions League at the group phase, are likely to show at least some form of downturn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
