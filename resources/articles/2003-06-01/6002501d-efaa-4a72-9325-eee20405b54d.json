Tel (if in Jerusalem): 02 6284216; mobile: 052753588. He told me he should be able to get you through Israeli checkpoints in the West Bank and then you can enter Jordan via the Allenby Bridge. Derek Stainsby \u00b7 You cannot cross the Allenby into Jordan unless you have a visa. Get one in the UK before you leave or get one in Tel Aviv. You can obtain a visa at either the Eilat or Sheikh Hussein (Beit Shean) crossing points. You can, however depart Jordan from the Allenby. There is regular bus service from West Jerusalem to both points. You will have to take a private taxi from East Jerusalem to either places if you want to go that route. Check the opening times of the Allenby as on weekends it closes early. Harley"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
