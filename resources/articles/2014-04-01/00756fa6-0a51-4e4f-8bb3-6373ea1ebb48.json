This is what you might see: Karen refugees learning English idioms, young Sudanese-Australians at the computers or a Chinese woman browsing through audiobooks. You might hear the lilt of nursery rhymes from a far corner, where babies and toddlers are waiting to be read stories. Behind the shelves, elderly women are playing Scrabble. \"No committee decides who may enter,\" Maya Angelou said of public libraries. \"No tuition is charged, no oath sworn, no visa demanded.\" More than a decade ago, it was where I felt the first stirrings of connection, a young Filipino migrant starting from scratch. I felt no scrutiny or judgment there. I could walk in without a dollar to my name and yet fail to leave empty-handed. In multicultural areas on the metropolitan fringe, libraries are non-negotiable assets. They are a vital hub for new migrants, students, job searchers and pensioners who would otherwise not have access to books, computers, the Internet and a printer. It is not just that these things are available near home. There are people whose job it is to assist you. It makes for an inclusive space, perhaps one of the few remaining where transactions don't require a cash register. It is difficult then to reconcile with the federal government decision to pull $1.05m for the construction of a new library in Tarneit, the next suburb over from where I live. The Coalition claims that the funding was a Labor election promise, though federal share of the cost was in fact included in the 2013-2014 budget. Even if it were the case that it doesn't have to honour commitments made by the previous government, its own MPs helped pass the budget that helped make the Tarneit library feasible. What's a million-dollar contribution to vital local infrastructure if we can fork out $12bn for fighter jets? Tarneit sits in Wyndham, one of the fastest growing municipalities in the country. Transport and broadband have barely kept up with the pace of development. There are streets that are still unable to connect to high-speed internet because there are no ports available. In fact, when I was still teaching a few years ago, I had students living in Tarneit who had to take a bus to the nearest library to complete their homework \u2013 one of those micro-inequities that don't get accounted for when education outcomes are compared. \"It's not just about books,\" says local MP Joanne Ryan, who took over the seat of Lalor occupied by former prime minister Julia Gillard. \"It's about lifelong access.\" She has set up a petition to reinstate the funds, arguing that Wyndham libraries are the glue keeping young families connected to the community. She recalls being \"staggered\" when she set up a mobile office next to the Point Cook library and saw the number of families being served, which validated the city council's strategy of establishing satellite libraries in high-growth areas. It is evident that libraries remain a valuable entry point for new arrivals into the community. In other words, when funding for a new public library in a burgeoning suburb like Tarneit is pulled, it is not just a building that is jeopardised. This is not an entirely sentimental argument. Studies consistently demonstrate significant dividends from public investment in libraries. In Victoria, every dollar spent on libraries delivers $3.60 of benefit, through things like literacy initiatives and economic stimulus via local employment and expenditure. With a per capita spend of $36 each year on public libraries in the state, it's a bargain. Given the significant role that public libraries play, the move to withdraw a million dollars from a much-needed library in Melbourne's chronically under-resourced outer west is not just inexplicable. It seems downright petty and callous."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
