Two years earlier he was the inaugural Masters champion and two years later, in the Holsten International, he made the first 147 maximum in competition, but it was not recorded because the Thames TV crew were on a meal break. He won Pot Black, BBC2's one-frame tournament, three times. Spencer borrowed \u00a3100 from his bank manager and won his first world championship - worth \u00a31,780 - in the 1968-9 season. Ray Reardon, with whom he dominated most of the 70s, beat him in the April 1970 semi-final but when the championship was held again in Sydney in November that year Spencer made three centuries in four frames to secure his second title. His game faded as the 70s wore on. He lost his appetite for practice and in a car crash he broke the cue he had used since his earliest games. When it was pinned together by a cue doctor he won the odd tournament but it never felt quite the same. Just before the 1977 championship he adopted a new Canadian two-piece and beat Cliff Thorburn for his third title. It was his last significant success. He was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis in 1985, a wasting of the eye muscles. He worked as a BBC summariser and was chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association from 1990 to 1996 but then he contracted stomach cancer. He found his treatment so horrific that a year ago he announced he would have no more. \"Maybe I could have another 10 years and be miserable with the treatment, but I'd rather have a year and enjoy it,\" he said. It was a year in which he completed his autobiography, Out Of The Blue, Into The Black."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
