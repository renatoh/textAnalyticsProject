Waving flags bearing the extinction symbol, which was seen across central London earlier this year when Extinction Rebellion protests brought the city to a standstill, the crowd marched for about an hour in the scorching afternoon sun on Thursday from the festival\u2019s park stage to its stone circle. Speaking to the crowd on the second day of the 49th Glastonbury festival, Dr Gail Bradbrook from Extinction Rebellion, said: \u201c[Extinction Rebellion] is not a protest. It is not a campaign. It is a rebellion. We are in active rebellion against our government. The social contract is broken, the governments aren\u2019t protecting us and it\u2019s down to us now.\u201d Bradbrook said people were waking up to the climate emergency. \u201cThis is not a slow movement of change. It\u2019s a shift in the consciousness of each of us. \u201cIt is a collective shift. It involves facing grief and trauma and undoing our numbness and our narcissism and our indulgence that we have in this privileged western society.\u201d The procession was part of a push to have environmental issues front and centre at this year\u2019s festival. This includes the well-publicised ban on single-use plastics on site with vendors having to strictly adhere to the policy, and attendees have been encouraged to bring their own water bottles and fill them up at one of the 800 taps on site. Rosie Rogers, an activist from Greenpeace, told the crowd there was a long way to go in the fight against climate change but that she was \u201chopeful\u201d. \u201cI feel hopeful that all of us in all of our different movements and identities can come together and truly unite for what is the fight of our life to defend this planet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I also feel truly grateful for the brothers and sisters all over the world, especially those in the global south, the Amazon and other places, who have given so much to protect this planet.\u201d Kurukindi, a Kichwa Amazonian Shaman activist and part of the Wisdom Keepers, a group of indigenous leaders from around the world, spoke to the crowd with the help of a translator. \u201cWe love our friends. We love our children,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that love needs to extend to the planet that we are on and the earth beneath our feet.\u201d Jenny Bleasdale, a 60-year-old civil servant from Exeter who joined the procession, said she was at the end of her tether with the failure of political parties to \u201cgrasp the nettle of the climate emergency\u201d. \u201cWe need to pass on the message and there needs to be some hope attached to it otherwise people won\u2019t even bother,\u201d she said. Naomi Scott, 24, an activist with Extinction Rebellion in Scotland, said Glastonbury was the perfect place to spread the group\u2019s message. \u201cThere are 250,000 people here and we need everyone out on the streets in October, so it\u2019s amazing to be able to walk though this festival. It\u2019s a really amazing platform to spread the message.\u201d As the sun set over Worthy Farm on Wednesday evening, in a corner of the Tipi Field the Wisdom Keepers performed a ritual to officially open the 2019 edition of the festival. Stood in a circle around a fire, hands clasped together they took turns to say blessings and prayers. The 12 tribal elders were invited by Emily Eavis specifically to christen the festival, claiming their loftier aim was \u201cto catalyse festival culture for climate awareness\u201d. The idea is that as the planet moves towards a potentially catastrophic environmental situation, indigenous cultures can offer solutions and alternative ways to live sustainably. \u201cEverything runs smoother when you\u2019ve got an elder in the house,\u201d said Jarmbi, an aboriginal leader from northern New South Wales who is part of the group. \u201cSomeone who has screwed up, fixed it and come back. We need to show people what is missing. There are elders here who can talk about tribal life and how its structured the way it is and why it works. That\u2019s part of the wisdom that is missing.\u201d Ben Christie, the group\u2019s UK liaison, said that the Wisdom Keepers and their traditions are crucial in the modern world. \u201cThese cultures are palpably more sustainable, more harmonious, more equitable. We\u2019re at that point in our culture where we\u2019ve ran out of ideas and it looks like a bit of a car crash. \u201cIt\u2019s not exoticism, saying, \u2018Oh God you\u2019re all great and we\u2019re crap.\u2019 They\u2019ve got lots of missing pieces which we need to learn from.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
