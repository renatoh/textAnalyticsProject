In the wake of a survey which revealed that one in seven travellers never takes out travel insurance and 70% do not bother to research their destinations before they go, the FO has improved its travel advice website and signed up tour operators, travel agents and other travel industry partners to spread its 'Know Before You Go' message. New features on the website include a 10-point checklist of things to do before going on holiday and a list of travellers' tips for each country. 'We've tried to gear it towards holidaymakers, not just people who are going to far-flung places or war zones,' said Matthew Gould, deputy head of the FO's consular division. 'We've included practical information which could save people a lot of trouble. For example, if you are travelling to Japan, cashpoints close at 9pm and certain types of Vicks inhalers are illegal. And British driving licences are not accepted in Dubai.' Gould said many of the 45,000 cases the FO deals with each year could be avoided if people knew more about the local customs, laws and troublespots of the places they visited and protected themselves with adequate insurance. 'It's heartbreaking enough when someone gets ill or has an accident abroad, but it's a double tragedy when the family then has to find \u00a325,000 to pay for an air ambulance to get them home,' he said.
