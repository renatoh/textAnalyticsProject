The incident, which happened in August, was captured on police body cameras. Months later, city officials who want the body camera video kept secret are in a battle with advocates of police accountability that many believe will be fought out in the Minnesota legislature. The man who was shot by police, 34-year-old Joe Zontelli, survived. The two officers involved were cleared of wrongdoing. But the incident made news in the midwest city of 86,000, and after an investigation was completed by the St Louis County attorney Mark S Rubin, reporters expected the video to be released. It was not. \u201cThe state crime lab kind of takes over the investigation and we just kind of waited out the results,\u201d said Tom Olsen, a reporter for the Duluth News Tribune who filed a public records request for the police body camera videos. He said that under normal circumstances, reporters would have received their information requests after an investigation was complete and a press conference held. The county prosecutor reviewed body camera footage, but authorities didn\u2019t release the videos. Gunnar Johnson, the Duluth city attorney, instead used a legal maneuver to try to temporarily classify the video \u2013 and future videos from other cases Duluth requested the state clarify what body camera footage is public and what should be kept private, through an unusual request to Minnesota\u2019s information policy analysis division. The office denied Duluth\u2019s request, in what will be the final word on the issue unless the legislature picks it up this spring. Johnson said his office was now \u201cworking\u201d with the decision, \u201cwith the support of other municipalities\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a difference between a piece of paper and a videotape,\u201d he said. \u201c[Body camera footage] can span for, you know, an hour, two hours, there can be multiple cameras and, administratively, it\u2019s a whole different world.\u201d The city requested that blanket secrecy be applied to body camera footage taken in schools, hospitals and \u201cprivate places\u201d. The city also wanted footage from mental health crises, suspected juvenile crimes, and response to domestic and sexual assault to be classified as private. Summaries of many of the same law enforcement activities are publicly available through police reports. Privacy experts and law enforcement alike issued warnings about situations like that in Duluth. Transparency programs are politically popular, but in practice, many governments seek veto power over what is public. Given that Duluth police officers entered Zontelli\u2019s home, followed him to the garage and saw blood beneath the barricaded door while he threatened his own life, it is understandable that releasing body camera video of the incident might be seen as invasive. Typically, a home is considered a private place and health issues a private matter. But when officers broke down the door, saw Zontelli had a knife, shot him twice and then claimed they had feared for their lives, some say the line between public and private vanished. Advocates say any officer-involved shooting is a matter of public interest. \u201cOne of the reasons for the body cam is to have the availability to see if law enforcement is doing their job,\u201d said Rich Neumeister, a long-time privacy and freedom of information activist in Minnesota. \u201cWhen I look at it in balancing the public interest weighs out, because this is where [residents] are shot by officers. There\u2019s no ifs, ands or buts. It\u2019s fact.\u201d City police disagree. \u201cI\u2019m a huge proponent of cameras,\u201d the Duluth police chief, Gordon Ramsay, told the Duluth News Tribune. \u201cBut we need to figure out how to balance the need for transparency while respecting the privacy expectations of our citizenry.\u201d In June, Duluth became the first major police department in Minnesota to roll out body-worn cameras. But as the cameras are pushed by politicians \u2013 in the aftermath of this year\u2019s civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, President Barack Obama proposed $263m in federal funding to put 50,000 more cameras on the streets \u2013 Duluth is unlikely to be the only department facing policy questions. Leading privacy and anti-surveillance advocates at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) are cautiously optimistic about the deployment of body cameras, but cite the lack of policy on the subject as worrisome. The organization recently asked 30 leading departments for their body-worn camera policies. \u201cA large percentage of them simply don\u2019t have them,\u201d said Chris Rickerd, policy counsel for the ACLU. \u201cThe idea of rushing out something that is so important for accountability if the right policies are in place without these complicated, thorny issues thought through \u2026 is really irresponsible.\u201d Olsen provided a copy of Duluth\u2019s body camera policy, after Johnson told the Guardian a public records request would need to be filed to obtain a copy, a process that typically takes weeks. The policy requires officers to turn the cameras on during \u201ccrimes in progress\u201d and \u201cuse of force\u201d. But the policy does not answer more detailed questions about privacy, such as whether to record when interviewing children or whether residents can opt out of recording. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d Johnson said. The state\u2019s response to Duluth\u2019s request was cut and dried \u2013 public records law is there, follow it. But the agency\u2019s director said she understood that following the law was not. \u201cDuluth didn\u2019t have to request this temporary classification,\u201d said Stacie Christensen, director of the Minnesota information policy analysis division, which handled the request. \u201cI think the city attorney was speaking to the new technology and just the fact that the law hasn\u2019t kept up with technological advances.\u201d \u201cWe certainly understand the difficulties in trying to redact a videotape, that\u2019s something that will never be easy,\u201d said Christensen. \u201cWhen you actually have to deal with a request, and deal with what is public and what is not public, that is certainly where it gets complicated.\u201d However unnerving the situation is for officials in Duluth, it may soon come to a head. Olsen said he senses the city may be \u201cpreparing right now to release that particular video\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
