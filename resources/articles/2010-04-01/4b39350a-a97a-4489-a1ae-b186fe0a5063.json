In a note, the official responsible for sending out the memo \u2013 a junior civil servant in his 20s \u2013 said: \"Please protect; these should not be shared externally. The 'ideal visit' paper in particular was the product of a brainstorm which took into account even the most far-fetched of ideas.\" Foreign secretary David Miliband was said to be \"appalled\", and Britain's ambassador to the Vatican, Francis Campbell, has met Holy See officials to voice the government's regret. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"This is clearly a foolish document that does not in any way reflect UK government or Foreign Office policy or views. Many of the ideas in the document are clearly ill-judged, naive and disrespectful. The text was not cleared or shown to ministers or senior officials before circulation. As soon as senior officials became aware of the document, it was withdrawn.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
