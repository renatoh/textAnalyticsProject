The country with the highest percentage of smokers in the EU is finally cracking down on nicotine addicts. The stiffest penalties of three-month jail terms will be reserved for those taking a puff in a hospital, but smoking is being banned from all inside public areas, including banks, from the end of this year. A spokesman from the Greek Embassy said the ban would start in earnest from January, by which time restaurants must provide special non-smoking areas - though bars and nightclubs will be exempt from the law. \u00b7 Island hoppers in Greece should avoid travel on 18 June when a proposed public-workers' strike is likely to cause ferry stoppages. A one-day strike at the end of May resulted in dozens of scheduled ferry journeys from Piraeus being scrapped. A spokeswoman from Greek umbrella union ADEDY said the strikes were being staged to protest against the government's proposals for social security reform."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
