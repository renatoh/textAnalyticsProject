It really is stark - girls outperforming boys at every level and in almost every subject. Worryingly, the gap widens as children go through school and, although it's a world phenomenon, the difference is more marked in the UK than in many of our competitor nations. It's not surprising that this underperformance of boys causes such great national anxiety. So it should. But while we worry about boys falling behind, we ought to recognise and learn from the massive leap forward by girls. This dominance by girls wasn't always the case. Parity came in the 1970s and girls surged ahead about a decade later. So what happened? It may be that the way we now assess performance favours girls, but there's a bigger story behind it than that. The 1970s was the first time I'd seen the technique of relentlessly focusing on an underperforming group. Raising the ambitions and achievement of young girls reflected the social changes of the time and it was carried through with energy and enthusiasm. Based on research, barriers to girls' achievement were understood and targeted; teachers experimented with different teaching styles and groupings; successful women from all walks were brought into schools to act as role models to young girls, and countless hours were put into working with girls both individually and in groups. And it worked. In my view, it was one of the biggest achievements of 1970s feminism - and I use that term in the widest sense. The same techniques have since been tried with other underperforming groups with varying degrees of success. Standards have increased for African-Caribbean girls and Pakistani boys, for example, but not for boys in general. The lesson is well learned, though, that for some groups, extra and targeted support is needed if they are going to do as well as they should. Which is why I think we ought to be looking at the group of students entering our universities from non-traditional backgrounds. So much effort, from government and others, is being made in schools to break the link between missing out on higher education and poverty - but the support can't stop there. There are some worrying figures. Higher education retention rates, which have held steady for years, have begun to slip. This may, in part, be the first-generation students who, having managed to get there, are not always staying the course. Both government and higher education must realise that many of these students will need specific and different support from the generations that have preceded them. They are more likely to be managing study and home responsibilities. More will need to work to earn and for more hours. Many will only have made it because of the whole host of support systems recently introduced into schools. And they are likely to have been taught by teachers who've developed different and innovative teaching styles. There is a responsibility on universities to recognise this and adapt the way they deliver courses, as well as their support services. But the government will also have to accept that the call for extra resources from universities who admit a significant number of first-generation students is just as powerful a voice as any other in higher education. The work to broaden participation in higher education is politically right, and crucial to the social and economic agenda. It would be a great pity if the government's efforts stopped when entry to university was achieved. Remember the lessons from girls in the 1970s - changing centuries of culture takes time and resources, but most of all sustained effort and investment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
