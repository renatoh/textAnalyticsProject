Tony Blair told the Commons that around 500 teachers were being made redundant from schools in England and the Department for Education and Skills estimated that half the cuts were related to changes due to falling pupil rolls as opposed to school deficits. But headteachers and teachers said this was just the \"tip of the iceberg\" as many posts were not being re-filled once contracts expired or staff retired, and warned the drive to raise educational standards would suffer. David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the figures did not take into account the number of teachers whose temporary contracts had not be renewed or the vacancies not filled when staff left at the end of the summer term. A lot of support staff hours were also being lost, he said. \"We ought to be using falling rolls, unless they are extreme, as an opportunity to improve the staffing position in our schools, not treat them as an excuse for sacking teachers.\" Five hundred redundancies was still 500 too many, he went on. \"At a time when the government's number one priority is education, education, education, the idea that we should be suffering any redundancies at all is grotesque.\" Mr Hart added: \"It is abundantly clear that if the government does not produce a significantly better funding deal for the next two years, the level of redundancies seen this year will be like a children's tea party.\" John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"This indicates the seriousness of the situation in these schools but, more importantly, is the figure of the number of jobs lost of teachers and support staff, which are very much higher and which means that schools will find it very difficult to maintain the rise in standards next year.\" During prime minister's questions in the Commons today, Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith criticised the education secretary, Charles Clarke, claiming he had not told the truth when he predicted that the 2003 redundancy figure would be in line with previous years. Only a third of schools had yet declared their position, the Conservative leader said. \"The estimates show at least 800 teachers are facing the sack directly as a result of the funding crisis. When the education secretary said 'the overall level of redundancies will be of the same order as in past years', will you confirm that he was simply not telling the truth?\" Mr Blair replied: \"No, I won't confirm that at all. It's correct that every year there are teachers that are made redundant, and the estimates they have given are the correct figures. Of course it's true that there are certain schools in certain parts of the country that have faced real funding problems, particularly as a result of the changing formula. However, overall, the position is as I described, which is a very large increase in school funding.\" Mr Duncan Smith replied: \"Increases in National Insurance, problems over the funding - it's down to the government, and the education secretary was simply not telling the truth. The figures for redundancies are that three times as many this year will face the sack as last year. So the education secretary, as ever, first tried to blame schools, then when that failed he tried to blame councils. Surely he has only himself now to blame. Six years ago you promised to make education your first priority. Now the government is sacking teachers. Shouldn't you immediately get to the despatch box and apologise to parents, teachers and governors and apologise for this, your crisis?\" Mr Blair said a small minority of schools had been affected, though some seriously. But Labour had funded 25,000 more teachers and 80,000 more support staff, he said, while accusing the Tories of opposing extra investment in schools."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
