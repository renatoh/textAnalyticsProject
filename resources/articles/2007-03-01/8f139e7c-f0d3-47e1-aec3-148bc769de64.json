Mr Abe said the government would cooperate with a study by a group of Liberal Democrat MPs who are sceptical of claims that thousands of Asian women were forced to work in Japanese military brothels before and during the second world war. Historians believe up to 200,000 women, mainly from China and South Korea, were forced to work in about 2,000 \"comfort stations\" - a euphemism for brothels - until Japan's defeat in 1945. Mr Abe's decision to cooperate with the MPs, led by former education minister Nariaki Nakayama, comes amid pressure on the issue from the US. Congress is preparing to vote on a non-binding motion proposed by House Democrat Mike Honda calling on Tokyo to \"formally acknowledge [and] apologise ... in a clear and unequivocal manner for its imperial armed forces' coercion of young women into sexual slavery\". Mr Abe resisted calls for the government to conduct its own investigation. \"The party will conduct the research,\" he told reporters. \"The government will cooperate as needed by providing materials.\" The group of more than 120 MPs has claimed that the brothels were operated by private contractors, not military officials. They want to water down an unofficial apology issued in 1993 by the then chief cabinet secretary, Yohei Kono, which expressed the government's \"sincere apologies and remorse\". The MPs said in their proposal that Mr Kono's statement, which was not approved by parliament, was \"based on a one-sided recognition not backed by objective facts\". \"For the sake of Japanese honour, and for the honour of those Japanese who sacrificed their lives, we should state the facts,\" said Mr Nakayama. Mr Abe, in an apparent attempt to mollify his critics, said yesterday that he stood by the wording of the Kono statement, which acknowledged that the women had been forced to work in brothels, in many cases by Japanese military authorities. But acceptance of the group's findings is expected to heighten diplomatic tensions. It comes before a trip by the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, to Tokyo in April and a visit by Mr Abe to Washington."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
