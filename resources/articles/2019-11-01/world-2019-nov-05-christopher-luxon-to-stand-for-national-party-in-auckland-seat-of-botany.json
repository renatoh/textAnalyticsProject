Luxon, 49, resigned as the national carrier\u2019s chief executive in September after seven years leading the airline through a period of success and growth,\u2013 including repeatedly being named the world\u2019s best airline. He has also held a number of senior roles with the multinational company Unilever over a period of 18 years. The socially-conservative businessman says he is focused on \u201clearning\u201d and listening to the people of Botany, but his name has already appeared on polls as a candidate for preferred prime minister, polling just 5% below current National party leader Simon Bridges. Luxon told Morning Report that he was anti-abortion, anti-euthanasia and doesn\u2019t want to legalise recreational marijuana, and the more pressing issue for his constituents was transport. \u201cI\u2019m just interested in solving problems, and we have a lot of problems in this country,\u201d Luxon told RNZ. \u201cWe are very good at platitudes. We\u2019ve got very good at buzzwords and ideology, but we\u2019re not getting things done for people. That means that we\u2019re not making a difference in people\u2019s lives daily, and that\u2019s something we have to work really hard at.\u201d Luxon will stand for the seat against independent Jami-Lee Ross, who fell out with the National party last year in spectacular fashion. The former prime minister John Key has endorsed Luxon\u2019s determined tilt towards politics, describing him as a \u201cworld-class candidate\u201d. Luxon said National party leader, Simon Bridges, had his full support and deserved the top job, saying speculation that he wanted the leadership for himself was premature. \u201cI\u2019ve just been elected to be the candidate for Botany. I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do, I\u2019ve got a lot to learn. And more importantly, frankly we\u2019ve got a job to do \u2013 to make Simon Bridges the prime minister of New Zealand,\u201d Luxon grew up in the Botany area and says his childhood instilled \u201chard-working, middle-class values\u201d in him. \u201cLike the rest of New Zealand, it [Botany] is facing the pinch from a Coalition government that is breaking its promises to Kiwis, hiking the cost of living, and failing to deliver on the things that matter.\u201d Luxon is an evangelical christian and is married with two children. He has been a stalwart of the New Zealand business scene for decades, including serving as chair on the current prime minister\u2019s business advisory council. Luxon is also the recipient of the Peter Blake Leader Award and the Deloitte CEO of the year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
