Above all, it\u2019s a gorgeous, unsentimental tribute to the relationship between Grace Dent and her father, George. It\u2019s about the ways in which love is communicated in a working-class family that doesn\u2019t do \u201ctouchy-feely\u201d and what happens when a man who has never been one for intimate talk slowly slides out of reach into dementia. In a media career spanning more than two decades, Dent has trained her irreverent eye on most aspects of popular culture, but she\u2019s best known now as a restaurant critic and the early part of Hungry revisits the ways in which family life shaped her relationship with food. Ex-soldier George teaches her to cook with Campbell\u2019s tinned soup. The Dents were a happy, if undemonstrative, family, though George is given to hugging his daughter and telling her: \u201cYou\u2019re my only little girl.\u201d When this later proves untrue \u2013 he turns out to have two previous daughters, whose photo she finds in a drawer \u2013 Dent finds ways to excuse him so that she doesn\u2019t have to revise her feelings. Hungry is, as you\u2019d expect, very, very funny. There are inflections of Alan Bennett in her tone \u2013 \u201cSadly, Mother\u2019s aim to be posh was thwarted at every turn by our next-door neighbours, who were resolutely common\u201d \u2013 and echoes of Caitlin Moran in her tales of arriving in the world of London glossy magazines, where she is intimidated by sleek girls called Taffeta Flinty-Wimslow who only eat salad. George\u2019s illness is glimpsed throughout the book, from the early days when it\u2019s still a family joke (\u201cHe\u2019s not got dementia,\u201d her mother assures her, \u201che\u2019s just a dickhead\u201d) to the final Christmas, when food provides a way to bring the family together in the most painful circumstances. Dent is a fine comic writer, but she is also superb on grief and the small moments of connection that offer a way through. \u2022 Hungry by Grace Dent is published by Mudlark (\u00a316.99).
