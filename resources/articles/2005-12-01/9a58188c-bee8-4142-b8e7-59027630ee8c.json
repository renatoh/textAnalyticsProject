In the same issue of the Guardian, our attention is drawn to the predicament of the polar bear struggling for survival on rapidly thinning ice. The causes of both these major crises can be traced directly to a global market economy which has commodified our transport and our culture alike, promoting a costly lifestyle above living, while overheating the economy along with the earth's atmosphere, thus threatening species and activities for which the climate has become too hot. What used to be called \"music\" (now labelled \"classical\" by the media and thus automatically rarified) lacks the muscle to fight back against a perception of non-commercial music being no longer important to society - a perception which the broadsheets reinforce by their allocation of less and less space for coverage of live orchestral music compared to pop and the whole recorded music product. Yes, government schools policy of training for work rather than educating for life is equally to blame, and they and the media have an urgent need to give our essential culture of music-making and appreciation a life-saving boost, before it goes the way of the polar bears. Howard Williams Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama I am the conductor of a chamber orchestra, St Helens Sinfonietta, formed in 1997. They don't have the resources to pay me pound;100,000 per concert, but if they had, I wouldn't take it. For the first two years of its existence I took no fee at all in order to give the new orchestra a chance to become established. Since then, my fee has been of the same order as those of the members of the orchestra. This is a far cry from the world in which maestros command crazy money and reduce orchestras to penury. Perhaps the St Helens Sinfonietta is a signpost for the future. Alan Free St Helens, Merseyside The low incomes of orchestral players reflect that \"too many\" youngsters have been enthusiastic about becoming musicians and thus made it a buyers' market. The high fees of the stars likewise give the lie to a notion that classical music is insufficiently popular. Some groups may work miserably to a hierarchical pecking-order culture but that doesn't mean that all must, at least any more than happens in politics, the media, bureaucracies, etc. But Ibbotson's biggest error is the notion that declining demand obliges that traditions must be thrown out. Classical performances now compete not only with an ocean of digital recordings but also with many other ways of spending money which the capitalist system prioritises due to being more profitable. It does not follow that the traditional formats can be improved upon; in all likelihood they cannot. Dropping the centuries-old formalities, which have evolved for good reasons, could instead be the death of live classical music. Robin Clarke Birmingham As a classical music journalist, I can confirm, with regret, the accuracy of the negative picture of the orchestral world painted by Ibbotson. However, there are many beacons of light in the gloom, and I would like to pay tribute to the Northern Sinfonia for giving its audience their money's worth visually as well as aurally in two recent concerts. I was impressed by the way the players entered into the spirit of a filmnight programme at the Sage Gateshead, the orchestra's spanking new home; and even more by their evident enjoyment of a Mozart and Bach programme at the University of York. Solo moments, duets and ensemble passages were relished not just by the performers but by their colleagues, and smiles were in plentiful supply. So much so that my student son, who was singing in the choir, but unlike me has not been following the debate about concert presentation, commented on how refreshing it was to sit behind orchestral players who were clearly appreciating the music and, as he put it, \"having a laugh\".
