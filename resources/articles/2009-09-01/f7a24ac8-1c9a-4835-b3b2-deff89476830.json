It may be raining frogs, relegation may already be certain, life may seem bereft of reason or purpose. Yet no matter how bad things are, console yourself with this: when you get out of bed in the morning you don't have to watch breakfast television in America. Watching breakfast TV in America is like being drowned in a vat of syrup. It is the place where irony goes to die, where context and intelligence are on a holiday that never seems to end. But like the proverbial monkey pecking at a typewriter, even the most mind\u2011numbing television show occasionally illuminates the human experience with Shakespearean clarity. The appearance of Serena Williams on Good Morning America this week, in the aftermath of her tantrum at the US Open, was one such occasion. You can find it on YouTube but be warned: it is a deeply uncomfortable experience watching this proud, strong and intelligent women humbled as time and again she tries to talk about her new book only to have the host redirect the conversation back to her profanity-laced tirade against a line judge. It is hard not to feel sorry for Williams, although there will be plenty who are disinclined to do so. After all, she has only herself to blame. She was the one who committed the original foot fault, the one who lost her temper, the one who when asked shortly thereafter if she would apologise to the lineswoman said: \"An apology for ...? From me?\" What a difference a couple of days and an avalanche of public opprobrium makes. Suffice to say, the lineswoman in question has been in receipt of more apologies from Williams than she could possibly need. Indeed, the player has even offered to give her a big hug. As for Williams, she can only hope that people have short memories or that YouTube, where every embarrassing moment lives forever, goes out of business. Alternatively, she could sit at home and quietly fume at her misfortune in participating in a sport where the line between conduct acceptable and unacceptable has not become blurred, there being others where the fortitude of those who make and enforce the rules lasts as long as it takes a football club to send a lawyer's letter. If that sounds over-wrought, contrast the treatment of Williams with that of Eduardo da Silva of Arsenal, who, like Williams, brought his sport into disrepute with a very public flouting of its rules during last month's Champion's League qualifier against Celtic. You could argue \u2013 as some of our myopic friends have \u2013 that Eduardo didn't dive, that he was brought down by Artur Boruc. Likewise, some have said that Williams was the victim of a bad call by a lineswoman with a \"look at me\" complex. Maybe all of the above is true, but even if it was the case that Eduardo and Williams were \"innocent\", this is hardly the point. The point is the integrity of rules, the enforcement of the rules and the consequences should those who enforce them lack both consistency and courage. In the case of Eduardo, Uefa has shown itself to be spineless as, first, it promised to \"investigate\" the accusations of diving against the Arsenal player, then imposed a two-match ban and then overturned the ban on appeal. Contrast this with the conduct of the US Open's tournament referee, Brian Earley, who stepped on to the court last Saturday night knowing that Williams's immediate future in the tournament was at stake but that so was the credibility of the sport. It was a big moment and he didn't flinch: she was out. You might think that this was a punishment too far, but look where we are today \u2013 the United States Tennis Association is being held up a model of good sporting governance while Uefa, once again, is the target of ridicule. Eduardo, meanwhile, is \"relieved\" or, to put it another way, free to do the same thing again. As for Serena, you just have to watch her bowing and scraping on breakfast TV to know her swearing days are over for good. Hicks' puts the 'offensive' into 'charm offensive' In the great landscape of human emotions nothing jars the consciousness as much as the presence of the words \"Tom Hicks\" and \"charm offensive\" in the same sentence \u2013 which meant reading Tuesday's newspapers was a painful experience. Apparently, Liverpool's co-owner had embarked on a \"charm offensive\" proclaiming that an era of prosperity is upon the club after it signed a new shirt sponsorship deal worth \u00a380m over four years. \"Our debt levels are at a comfortable level and we are going to continue bringing it down. Our goal is to have less debt than any of the top clubs,\" said Hicks. \"We are seeing for the first time the real power of the brand and the power of a well-managed club. I feel very good about the entire club. The total sponsorship contracts should probably bring in \u00a325m-\u00a326m of incremental revenue a year. It's a huge development for the club.\" Maybe I have a misplaced view of what constitutes charm? Or maybe there really is nothing more charmless than a sales pitch from a highly-leveraged Texan? Which is the case? Well, we didn't have to wait long to find out \u2013 24 hours, in fact, or as long as it took to discover that Hicks is trying to sell 25% of the club for \u00a3100m. Charming indeed. Murray missed his chance but might yet have another Ultimately, the drive and desire that makes an athlete world class comes from within, but just in case Andy Murray needs a little extra motivation he should know there are already some who have written off his prospects of ever winning a grand slam title. It is all a question of timing. The Scotsman, who at the age of 22 is now positively ancient, had his best opportunity this year when Roger Federer was \"fading\" (bear with me please), Rafael Nadal was injured and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro was learning how to serve properly. Well, as the Argentinian proved so brilliantly in beating Federer the other day in New York he can now serve properly. He can also return serve with power from both sides, hit outlandish winners, volley with touch and has the tenacity of an F1 driver in pursuit of a supermodel. Murray will never beat this guy, goes the thinking \u2013 except that life, and tennis, is never quite as simple as that. Injury, bad luck and off-court distractions might all set the Argentinian back. The Scot might also continue to improve. Let us wait and see. In the meantime, anyone who has already written off Murray should know he his lifetime record against the new god of tennis currently stands at 3-1 in his favour. Top dollar + bottom drawer = an unbalanced equation In American sport they call it the \"regular season\"; that lengthy period of time before the proper games \u2013 the play-offs \u2013 start. In the regular season, matches are about as compelling as domestic dramas of Pete and Jordan. There are no surprises and no purpose either, except to fleece the paying public by asking them to pay top dollar for bottom-drawer sport. In Europe, the regular season is called the group phase of the Champions League \u2013 another non-event which, as has happened in the NBA and in major league baseball, serves only to undermine the sport itself and to illuminate the greed of those in charge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
