You can tell by the way he talks \u2013 and talks and talks \u2013 by the enthusiasm and the explanations, analysis not just an answer; by the way he reels off lists and lineups and how, when asked if he remembers matches, moments, he does not say \u201cyes\u201d but \u201cyesyesyesyesyes\u201d; by the way one actually believes him when he says he knows what it means to play for Manchester United; by the way he talks about Northampton away and wishing he could watch United with the fans, only to correct himself and say that, actually no, that would mean he was not playing. Herrera says when he stops playing football he will watch football; he talks about old grounds, everyone standing, adopting an English phrase with Spanish currency, a mark of nostalgia and authenticity: \u201cI\u2019m a bit \u2018Against Modern Football\u2019\u201d; and admits to being \u201cfootball mad\u201d. But it is a redundant confession, already clear in the admiration \u2013 the reverence, even \u2013 with which he talks about players, places and matches. The next match especially, is one that feels fitting, for Spain against his United captain, Wayne Rooney. Framed portraits cover this room, the room next door and the corridor outside: every Spain international from Abel Resino to Andoni Zubizarreta. Soon Herrera will join them. Tuesday is his debut \u2013 at the place he calls \u201ca legendary stadium with an incredible history\u201d. It is his kind of place. Maybe it has been worth the wait, after all. Herrera is 27. A European Under-21 champion who is almost a decade into his career; it has been so long coming Rooney kept joking that the first time he ran out as an international would indeed be at Wembley \u2013 but not in red, in white. \u201cWhenever Spain did not call me, Wayne would say: \u2018Good: wait, you\u2019ll end up playing for us,\u2019\u201d Herrera says, adding, just in case: \u201cHe was joking, eh. He knew my dream was always to play for Spain. \u201cI know Vicente Del Bosque wanted to call me a couple of times. One time I broke a rib playing West Ham, jumping with [James] Collins, and the chance slipped by. That was hard. I\u2019ve always had faith, but you\u2019re aware that Spain has the best midfield in the world by a long way. Better than Argentina, Brazil, anyone: Iniesta, Silva, Cazorla, Mata, Koke, Isco, Tiago. Enough to pick three midfields, all of the highest level.\u201d Paul Scholes once described Herrera as United\u2019s best signing \u2013 \u201cFor a legend like him to say that is amazing,\u201d the Spaniard says \u2013 but there was no place in the national squad until now. The arrival of Julen Lopetegui helped; so did the arrival of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, changing his position. That list is no longer a list of Herrera\u2019s direct competitors. \u201cI\u2019m here because Mourinho\u2019s given me the chance to take a new role,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more defensive: hold my position, don\u2019t lose the ball, win it, bring it out fluidly, that \u2018rest defence\u2019. I\u2019m enjoying it. I\u2019m there for others.\u201d Paul Pogba, for a start. \u201cPaul\u2019s an offensive player; he needs freedom and the team needs him to have that,\u201d says Herrera. \u201cHe can score 10 a season. With his strength, the way he hits the ball with both feet, his ability in the air, you have to make the most of that.\u201d Herrera did not appear the typical Mourinho player, and the same was even more true of his best friend at United, Juan Mata. The assumption was they would never suit him, Mourinho\u2019s arrival a prelude to their departure. He was too defensive, too preoccupied with physical presence, too committed to the counterattack, not bothered about the ball. They were the opposite. Herrera once said that one thing he liked about Louis van Gaal was that he placed mucha, mucha, mucha importance on possession. Mourinho does not. The end was nigh. Yet here they are. \u201cThat\u2019s a myth,\u201d Herrera says. \u201cThere\u2019s an idea of Mourinho that\u2019s flawed. In many games we\u2019ve had more possession. Liverpool had more but otherwise we\u2019ve had more of the ball and more chances. Liverpool have been scoring loads: to limit them to two shots, both from distance, is a success. And with Ibra\u2019s chance we could have won 1-0. To go to Anfield, the form they\u2019re in, and stop them deserves praise. Some games you have to shut the door because they\u2019re \u2018on fire\u2019. Other days like Burnley, Stoke, Swansea, it\u2019s you who has to attack. \u201cEven against Chelsea possession was ours until the last 10, 15 minutes. OK, we deserved to lose but not 4-0. We had chances for 4-2 or 4-3. Mourinho\u2019s an attacking coach; what he\u2019s not is a kamikaze: he doesn\u2019t have us playing like mad men. He likes the \u2018rest defence\u2019 but he\u2019s an attacking coach who gives players freedom. He\u2019s also honest, sincere, says what he thinks to your face. If a coach isn\u2019t honest, players rumble him. There\u2019s a very good relationship. Mourinho\u2019s very straight.\u201d Unlike Van Gaal? \u201cIt\u2019s ungentlemanly to talk about coaches who\u2019ve left. I\u2019m grateful to Van Gaal: he brought me to United and I played 71 games so I wouldn\u2019t say a bad word. I prefer to talk about the present. The team\u2019s fine, enjoying the work, training well. I like Mourinho\u2019s sessions: very dynamic, always with the ball. There are no really long sessions or talks. He understands what a footballer needs: twenty minutes, that\u2019s it. No time to lose concentration. We\u2019re still there, and we should have five points more. We deserved to beat Stoke and Burnley. That was unbelievable. 37 shots, they have one and ...\u201d Herrera blows out his cheeks again. \u201cIncredible, incredible. I spoke to Juan [Mata] and we\u2019d never known anything like it. That happens once a season, but it\u2019s already happened twice. The ball hits the post and goes wide; soon it will hit the post and go in.\u201d Herrera is as effusive about team\u2011mates. Is Zlatan Ibrahimovic quite so, well, \u2018Zlatan\u2019 as he seems? \u201cHe\u2019s ... curioso\u201d. Herrera replies. There is a pause. \u201cHe\u2019s a superstar, but he\u2019s joking all day, winding people up, and he accepts you doing it back. He\u2019s 35 and look at him,\u201d Herrera continues, raising a skinny little finger. \u201cLike a lad of 28. He looks after himself, eats well, stretches, does his recovery work. There are no miracles \u2013 if you\u2019re like that at 35, that agile, that good, it\u2019s because you\u2019re professional. You give Ibra a melon and he turns it into a ball.\u201d Other team-mates will be opponents on Tuesday. Jesse Lingard \u201cunderstands the game very well\u201d and, as for Marcus Rashford, Herrera laughs. \u201cWe wind him up: \u2018How much money are you going to make?!\u2019 Because he has everything: he\u2019s quick, shoots well with both feet and I most like his willingness to defend. But, look, he\u2019s 19: we can\u2019t ask him to score 40 goals. Be patient. There will bad times but there will be good too because he\u2019s so talented. A humble kid with a brilliant future.\u201d Then there is the man Herrera seeks out most, the man trying to sign him for England. \u201cI talk to Wayne a lot,\u201d he says. Herrera uses the word sabidur\u00eda to describe the forward. It means \u2018wisdom\u2019, which may appear a strange choice but he means it: the admiration and affection are genuine. \u201cHe\u2019s as futbolero [football-mad] as I am. He has so many stories. I love talking to him because he knows the game so well.\u201d When it is suggested that Rashford and Rooney are at opposite ends both for United and England, one arriving on stage, the other leaving, Herrera responds swiftly. \u201cWell, \u2018leaving\u2019? Let\u2019s see. Look, Wayne\u2019s been playing at the highest level from 16. I didn\u2019t reach the first division until I was 20; he\u2019s got four years on me. All that adds up. Sunday, Wednesday, Sunday, Wednesday, national team, Euros, World Cup, competing, winning, again and again. Fifteen years at England\u2019s biggest club has an impact; people need to understand that. And he never disconnects, even when he\u2019s not playing. He\u2019s there, talking about how we can improve. \u201cHis attitude\u2019s impressed me. Wayne\u2019s a few goals from Bobby Charlton, yet we get two penalties and he gives the ball to Paul [Pogba] and Anthony [Martial] because they need the confidence. That shows you the class of person he is. The day I leave football, I\u2019ll remember that. And last season he pulled our chestnuts out the fire loads of times.\u201d Herrera laughs. \u201cIs there an English phrase for that?\u201d he asks. \u201cAnyway, he\u2019ll still do that: against Swansea he was fantastic.\u201d Herrera and Rooney have talked England, too. \u201cI don\u2019t think [fatigue] is a convincing argument. It\u2019s true there\u2019s an extra cup in England which has an impact but I think you notice that more in Europe than with the national team. It\u2019s also true that games are madder \u2013 I run more than I did in Spain \u2013 but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s harder physically. The intensity\u2019s high but not much higher than Spain. I don\u2019t think you pay for that. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure. I know, I see it: the media\u2019s hard, very hard. They\u2019re tough with the national team. As soon as something goes wrong, the players take some terrible hits. And I think there\u2019s a kind of disencanto [roughly, \u201ca disenchantment\u201d] with the national team now, isn\u2019t there? Games where Wembley hasn\u2019t filled. But they have the foundations, reason to believe and phenomenal players.\u201d This time Wembley will fill. Herrera will be there \u2013 and not in the crowd. His family will be, though. They travelled to Granada in case and from there to London. He is so enthusiastic about England that it feels fitting for him to have waited to make his international debut there and, besides, what is three more days? \u201cI knew sooner or later the chance would come. I worked for this: every day as if it was the last.\u201d In the end he got there: the same place where he won his one senior medal (last season\u2019s FA Cup), if not the same dressing room. \u201cUp the corridor to the right,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s England\u2019s or ours.\u201d As Rooney always said, he will be there too, but wearing a different shirt. And Herrera will not be swapping, not this time, not ever. \u201cIf I play, the shirt is for keeping,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough if Wayne doesn\u2019t mind giving me his and not getting mine, great. That would be a nice memento. Maybe I\u2019ll tell him that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
