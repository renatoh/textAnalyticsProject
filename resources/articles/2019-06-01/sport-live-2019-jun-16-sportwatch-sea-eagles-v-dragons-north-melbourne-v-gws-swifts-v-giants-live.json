I\u2019m going to settle back, pour myself something cold and enjoy the familiar sight of Mancunian clouds making people furious. Here is that liveblog, helmed by Tim de Lisle for starters. Join him. Cricket: Just a little reminder before I sign off that tonight\u2019s cricket promises to be one of the sporting spectacles of the year - India vs Pakistan in the World Cup. You can follow all the action on The Guardian\u2019s over-by-over coverage from 6.30pm. State of Origin: Oof! Some big news has just dropped with the announcement of the squads for the second instalment of this year\u2019s State of Origin. Brad Fittler has made SEVEN changes to his Blues for game two over at Optus Stadium in Perth. Daniel Saifiti (Newcastle Knights) and Dale Finucane (Melbourne Storm) will make their debuts, while James Maloney (2018), Tom Trbojevic (2018), Tariq Sims (2018), Blake Ferguson (2017) and Wade Graham (2017) have all been recalled. There\u2019s no place for under-fire Latrell Mitchell despite his double try-scoring performance for the Roosters earlier today. Queensland are forced into two changes with Joe Ofahengaue and Jai Arrow both unavailable due to injury. Tim Glasby and Jarrod Wallace come into the 17 in their places. Christian Welch, Edrick Lee and Corey Norman will also join Camp Maroon this week as part of the extended squad. North Melbourne\u2019s spirited performance wasn\u2019t enough in the end as the Giants scrapped their way to second place on the ladder at Blundstone Arena. There was nothing between the sides at the main break but the class of GWS told in the second half with Josh Kelly, Tim Taranto and Stephen Congilio running all over the Kangaroos in chilly conditions. This fixture always loomed as a perfect opportunity for the Roosters to regain their mojo and so it proved with the hapless Bulldogs bulldozed at the SCG. Not only did the Roosters snap their three-game losing streak but they also saw Latrell Mitchell return to form with a two-try five-goal outing. The only downside was a late Bulldogs try denying the Roosters second place on the ladder by points difference but they still leapfrog the Raiders into third. Cricket World Cup: This World Cup has been fun but the English rain and the interminable group phase means it hasn\u2019t yet come to the boil. That could all change in a couple of hours with the recommencement of perhaps the biggest rivalry in world sport - India vs Pakistan. Let\u2019s hope the skies over Manchester have cleared and the puddles on the Old Trafford outfield have dried to allow this blockbuster to go ahead. NRL: 60 mins: Roosters 24-6 Bulldogs - The Roosters are still well in control of the two points late on against the Bulldogs at the SCG. Drew Hutchison crossed shortly after half-time to put the result beyond doubt. Swoon. AFL: 3QT: North Melbourne 8.6 (54) v GWS 11.6 (72) - Still all to play for at Blundstone Arena but the class of GWS\u2019s silky midfielders is finally beginning to tell. Josh Kelly, Tim Taranto, and Stephen Coniglio are the leading ball-winners and they each have at least one goal to their credit for good measure. They\u2019ve needed to step up because North Melbourne\u2019s defenders are putting in a superb shift to keep the Giants\u2019s storied tall forward line quiet. Cricket World Cup: Australia moved to the top of the Cricket World Cup group phase table with victory over Sri Lanka last night but questions remain over strategy and selection after another flawed performance. Aaron Finch\u2019s innings was a beauty though and worth finding on replay. His timing in the V early on was textbook then his power towards the end was brutal. Good grief! What a finish in the Super Netball! The ladder-leading Swifts cemented their status as the team to beat in this year\u2019s competition with a thrilling comeback win over crosstown rivals the Giants, their second of the season. The Swifts trailed for long periods but stormed back in the second half to snatch a late victory and extend their lead in top spot to ten points. Sam Wallace finished with 48 goals from 50 shots, backed up by Helen Housby\u2019s 11 from 12 and game-high 23 assists. Behind them goalkeeper Sarah Klau starred with four intercepts and she was integral to getting her side back into the contest in the third quarter when they were down by five points. Swifts coach Briony Akle reserved praise for English star Housby who stepped up when it counted in a side that was missing some key players including captain Maddy Proud. \u201cWe always knew we were going to have to get the ball to the players who had been around for a bit longer with some girls missing, and she really stood up today for us especially at the end when we really needed it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a work in progress all week and we just had to tell ourselves that we were going to be okay without Maddy despite what the outside voices were saying and Helen was a key part of that.\u201d The Swifts will travel to Adelaide next weekend to play the seventh-placed Thunderbirds, while the Giants will look to regroup for the match in Sydney on Saturday night against the third-placed Melbourne Vixens in what looms as a must-win game. With AAP. NRL: HT: Roosters 16-6 Bulldogs - No surprises at the SCG with the Roosters using their afternoon outing against the bottom-placed Bulldogs to find some form after three matches without a win. The returning Latrell Mitchell answered his critics with a comeback try after just eight minutes before Joseph Manu and Sitili Tupouniua crossed to hand the fourth-placed side a 16-point lead. Will Hopoate bulldozed his way over to reduce the deficit before half-time but the Roosters are looking good for a return to third spot on the ladder. AFL: How Australian sporting competitions manage their crowds is becoming a hot topic of debate following the AFL\u2019s crackdown on antisocial behaviour. A string of fist fights filmed by social media has spurred AFL bosses into action but supporters and commentators are now concerned the response is too heavy handed. Marvel Stadium management will review security procedures after the AFLvenue\u2019s chief executive Michael Green conceded some fans felt intimidated by the more-visible security presence. With crowd behaviour in the spotlight in recent weeks, stadium management beefed up patrolling of the aisles by guards but the increased presence has caused a fan backlash. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly something that we\u2019ll need to review and try to come up with the right balance because we clearly haven\u2019t got it right at the moment,\u201d Green told SEN on Sunday. NBA: I confess to knowing little about the NBA but I\u2019m not blind to the significance of this \u201cWoj Bomb\u201d of a trade story. Super Netball: 3QT: Swifts 42-43 Giants - A thrilling final quarter is in store for the Sydney derby in Super Netball with the Swifts winning their first bonus point of the match to reduce the deficit to the Giants to just one goal. Sam Wallace is emerging as the dominant force on court for the ladder leaders. AFL: HT: North Melbourne 7.3 (45) v GWS 7.3 (45) - It\u2019s still anyone\u2019s game at half-time at Blundstone Arena. Supercars: Scott McLaughlin has ended a 13-year wait with a thumping win to become the first Supercars driver to win the Triple Crown in Darwin. DJR Team Penske star McLaughlin enjoyed a flawless weekend in the Top End after winning both races from pole and the top-10 shootout in his Ford Mustang. No driver had completed the trifecta since its inception in 2006. McLaughlin also drew level with legend Peter Brock to sit equal-second on the list of career pole positions (57). From AAP. This is fun. Ryan Pierse is a brilliant photographer and his incredible shots are enhanced by his commentary of the planning and technique that went into creating them. Women\u2019s World Cup: Plenty still going on in France as sides jostle for spots in the last 16. Australia\u2019s Matildas are back in action during the early hours of Wednesday morning when they\u2019ll be looking for a result against Jamaica that not only secures them the three points they need to reach the knockout phase but also provides enough of a goal difference boost to improve their path to the latter stages. Super Netball: HT: Swifts 27-30 Giants - There\u2019s still little separating these crosstown rivals and finals bound sides in the last Super Netball match of the round. Both goal shooters are operating at 100% efficiency in a high quality contest. Manly superstar Tom Trbojevic has starred in the Sea Eagles\u2019 34-14 NRL demolition of St George Illawarra to seal his return to the NSW State of Origin side. Des Hasler\u2019s side scored 34 unanswered points on Sunday to inflict further pain on the Dragons. They have lost six of their past seven games to leave them stagnating heading into the representative-round break. The Dragons dominated early possession to open up an 8-0 lead but, when Jack Gosiewski burrowed over seven minutes after halftime, the home side led 16-8. No.1 Trbojevic imposed himself on the game at Lottoland, erasing any concerns about his troublesome hamstring which had kept him out for most of the year. First, he pierced through the Dragons\u2019 line and Cade Cust crossed from the next play. Five minutes later, he caught out some lazy defence around the ruck to send Mainese Fainu over. Then he did it all himself, cleaning up a Corey Norman grubber and running 70 metres to cap a memorable performance. In what was just just second game back from injury, he finished with 333 metres, one try assist, two line breaks, two line-break assists, 11 tackle busts and five offloads to announce he was back to his best. He looks certain to be named in the NSW side for Origin two as a replacement for injured winger Nick Cotric. From AAP. AFL: QT: North Melbourne 3.0 (18) v GWS 3.2 (20) - Not much to separate the two sides in Hobart as the Giants bid to climb second on the ladder and the Kangaroos battle to keep their finals hopes alive. Super Netball: QT: Swifts 13-13 Giants - Even stevens at quarter time in the NSW derby. The Swifts are looking to extend their lead on top of the ladder, the Giants to secure that fourth and final playoff position. NRL: Some big State of Origin news today with injuries ruling Mitchell Pearce out of making his Origin return for the Blues. The NSW comeback of Mitchell Pearce is over before it even began with the halfback ruled out of contention for State of Origin Game 2 due to injury. The Newcastle Knights player was widely tipped to be recalled for the Blues for next Sunday\u2019s must-win game in Perth but the 30-year-old has succumbed to hip and groin complaints. NSW coach Brad Fittler revealed Pearce had phoned him on Sunday morning \u2013 just hours before the Game 2 team would be revealed \u2013 to rule himself out. NRL: 60 mins: Sea Eagles 28-8 Dragons - That early Dragons lead is a distant memory now with the Sea Eagles storming home at Brookvale Oval. Jack Gosiewski, Cade Cust, and Manase Fainu have all crossed in the second half. Golf: Brooks Koepka is not out of the running to secure a hat-trick of US Open titles but big-hitting Gary Woodland continues to lead the field at Pebble Beach with 18 hols remaining. Victory at Pebble Beach on Sunday would render Koepka only the second player, and first since 1905, to win this major in three consecutive years. Through 54 holes, Koepka \u2013 who makes a point of deriving inspiration from negative forces, real or otherwise \u2013 trails Woodland\u2019s 11 under par by four. The scale of Koepka\u2019s potential triumph should not be overstated; victory in this US Open would represent a fifth in just nine major starts. Boxing: Tyson Fury remains the lineal heavyweight champion of the world following a second round stoppage against Tom Schwarz in Las Vegas. Fury dominated from the outset, showing incredible footwork and fast hands to school his young opponent and raise expectations ahead of a rematch with Deontay Wilder. NRL: 43 mins: Sea Eagles 10-8 Dragons - We\u2019re just into the second half at Brookvale Oval where Manly have recovered from an early eight point deficit to sneak ahead of St George Illawarra. Ben Hunt\u2019s early try was cancelled out by Reuben Garrick and Dylan Walker to keep the home side on course for two points that will cement their status as top eight contenders. The Firebirds remain winless after eight rounds of the Super Netball season as the Vixens continued their march to the finals at Queensland State Netball Centre. Under the watchful eye of Diamonds coach Lisa Alexander the Vixens rallied from losing the opening two quarters to smash their hosts in the third, outscoring them 19-9 to surge into a lead they never looked like relinquishing. The visitors changed their defensive structure and were a different team after the long break, led by star goalkeeper Emily Mannix who enjoyed a game-high five interceptions. Caitlin Thwaites top scored for Melbourne with 42 goals from 46 shots in a performance bolstered by six offensive rebounds. Tegan Philip chipped in in with 29 from 34. Along with the Swifts and Lightning the Vixens are part of a three team breakaway at the top of the ladder halfway through the regular season. The Firebirds are not out of the running for that fourth and final playoff spot but they will require a miraculous run home to feature in September. With AAP.
