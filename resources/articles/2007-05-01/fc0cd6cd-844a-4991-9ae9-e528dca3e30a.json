Lesley Blanch, writer, adventurer, journalist and fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, has died aged 102, leaving us 11 highly coloured volumes of biography, travel, autobiography and cookery, plus, despite her protest that \"I can't invent,\" a single novel. For friends and readers of several generations, she has also bequeathed a unique aura: of scent - patchouli, attar of roses, or good French perfume - the clank of exotic but well-chosen jewellery, the flutter of a kerchief (from Turkey, perhaps, or a shop in Nice called Tissue S\u00e9duction), a hunger which \"relished both fat and lean\", and a body of prose whose mix of the voluptuous and austere is caught by the following passage of From Wilder Shores: the Tables of My Travels (1989): \"Ashe is Persia's basic soup ... I came to know ashe well, when staying ... in a house beside the curiously sullen waters of the Caspian. There, winter comes early. An incessant fine damp mist swirled mysteriously through the lush groves of orange and mulberry trees, and then ashe came into its own. We consumed it beside a fire of scented apple boughs, and as the autumnal gales tore round the wood-tiled roof, blowing straight in from the Russian steppes ... our appetites were keen.\" Blanch was a great and glamorous beauty well into extreme old age, her commanding, name-dropping manner rescued from absurdity by an unquenchable curiosity and a sense of the ridiculous, frequently directed towards what she inclined to describe, with just-adequate irony, as \"darling self\". She was born in Chiswick, west London, to unconventional and cultivated parents; her earliest memory was of beating her head against the nursery floor \"because I couldn't get my own way\". Her earliest avowed passion was for Russia - instilled by someone called \"the traveller\", a Muscovite of Tartar blood who was a family friend and later her lover. Her education involved \"reading whatever I wanted\", listening to \"the conversation of my elders and betters\", attending St Paul's girls' school, and learning to paint at the Slade, where Rex Whistler and Oliver Messel were her contemporaries. \"I was,\" she said, \"always very aware of other horizons.\" Obliged to earn a living at a time when women of her background generally did not do so, she illustrated and drew, became a journalist, and, in 1932, made the first of her five or six journeys to Russia. In the mid-1930s, she joined British Vogue, where, before and during the second world war, she worked as features editor, covering \"theatre, books, pictures, people\", acquiring and shedding at least one husband en route. In 1945 she married the Russian-born, naturalised Free French writer and diplomat Romain Gary, one of the many louche, romanticised and temperamental versions of le bel homme - as fond as she was of the grand gesture - for whom she had an explosive and lifelong enthusiasm. With him she lived in Paris, and en poste in Sofia, Berne, New York and Los Angeles, and started to journey in earnest - and largely alone. \"I've rather hopped on some trains in my time.\" And steamers across the Bosphorus, lorries through Afghanistan - any form of available transport to wherever she could around Mexico, Egypt, the Balkans, Siberia, the Caucasus, the Uzbek cites of central Asia, the Yemen, India, and beyond. She tended to \"travel heavy\" with \"creature comforts\", an icon, a silver miscellany of christening mugs from which to drink \"in remote areas\", and a great deal of knowledge absorbed from wide and disciplined reading of history, literature, 19th-century travel writing, old guidebooks and memoirs. From the 1930s to the 1980s, she liked to move about unplanned, relishing the unexpected circumstance, the juxtaposition of kebabs, tin plates and licked fingers \"along the road\" - or \"long days, gazing and guzzling\" through narrow and antique streets - and dining the next night, much admired and listened to, at an embassy or a palace in Rajasthan. The Wilder Shores of Love was published in 1954 by Jock Murray, who adored superior travellers. It was an instant and worldwide success, and has never gone out of print, its story that of four European women - Isabel Burton, Jane Digby, Aim\u00e9e Dubucq de Rivery and Isabelle Eberhardt - who variously found \"the heart of adventure\" through headlong love and otherwise in 19th-century north Africa and the Near East. In the cascading sentences and florid prose that characterises her writing, Blanch recreated (detractors would say concocted) history and its atmosphere: a synergy of fact and description, imaginative elan, and the penetration of a sharp and empathetic mind. The alliance of persons and method was then unique and remains attractive, as Blanch's original quartet and subsequent subjects, like the French orientalist Pierre Loti and Queen Marie of Romania, have been hijacked by long-winded others. \"It's unwise,\" she once observed to me, \"to do things too early. Imitators appear and take all the credit.\" Her titles are arresting: The Game of Hearts, Under a Lilac-Bleeding Star, The Nine Tiger Man, Journey Into the Mind's Eye, Pavilions of the Heart. One of these, The Sabres of Paradise (1960), adorns what she described as \"the book I was meant to do in my life\": the fabulous story of the 19th-century Imam Shamyl, who galvanised the Muslim tribes of the Caucasus into daring warfare which delayed Russia's subjugation of that region by nearly 30 years, and spent most of his final decade as Tsar Alexander II's prisoner. This volume of nearly 500 pages, exhaustively researched and distinguished with the aid of Shamyl's great-granddaughter, whom Blanch met in Istanbul, is an ultra-exotic chronicle of flamboyance supported by endurance, a rich evocation of the sort of human and topographical drama at which she excelled. It sold abundantly in several languages, is her only serious book and, arguably, a masterpiece. In the 1970s, she bought a house at Menton-Garavan, in the south of France - \"not Provence, but Liguria\" - planted a garden of bamboo and jasmine, and, though divorced from Romain since 1962, continued to call herself Madame Gary. \"In France,\" she would say, \"it improves my place at table.\" Her house was rare: a low pink structure set against a slope - hence its name, Ku\u00e7uk Teppe, meaning \"little hill\" in Turkish - whose rooms were a feast of her extraordinary life: banquettes strewn with eastern rugs and her inventive needlepoint, walls lined with icons, photographs, and an exquisite library, a dark floor on which her best Persian carpet glowed like stained glass. Tragically, in 1994, the house and most of its contents were destroyed by fire, and into the rather anonymous reconstruction Blanch diffused the music of Scriabin or the French-dubbed soundtrack of a John Huston film. There was an aura of subdued lighting beneath high mirrors that reflected replaced fragments of her library, its binding re-covered by \"darling self\" and titles inscribed by her rococo hand. In the midst of this, a burning jossstick and Blanch herself, trousered during the day, wearing gold-embroidered slippers and a scarf or crystal beads, and at night perhaps black. A tremendous occupier of centre stage, she talked and gossiped with long perspective, head thrown back at an angle, hand effecting a slow, declamatory gesture. She spoke fast, compulsively, with fascinating non-sequiturs, in a polished, old-fashioned voice which did not suffer fools or the interruptions of others, but was regularly broken by a ready laugh, frequently at her own expense. She expressed repeated enthusiasm - often for food, which she wrote about more convincingly than most - and complained forcefully, and latterly with great frustration, on the subject of crumbling bones. Reclusive in her final years, she adored being lionised by the French media, which republished her books and dispatched \"attractive young men\" to write laudatory interviews. She liked to elude as much as to recount and embellish, saving much for the autobiography on which she continued to labour after early drafts were lost in the fire. She was made an MBE in 2001. Her style and life were testaments of a vanished world, and no less of an achievement than the 12 unusual books which connoisseurs hold in uncommon affection. She called herself \"a romantic traveller\"; she was always a pro. \u00b7 Lesley Blanch, writer, traveller and journalist, born June 6 1904; died May 7 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
