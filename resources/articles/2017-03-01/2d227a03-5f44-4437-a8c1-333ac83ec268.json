It was also the year a little girl named JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey was found dead in her family home on Boxing Day, in the picturesque American town of Boulder, Colorado. Reported kidnapped then discovered brutally killed, the case was one of the first to be swallowed whole by the burgeoning 24-hour news cycle, accelerating daily due to cable TV, newly-minted home internet access, and a tabloid media baying for fresh blood after the sensational OJ Simpson case. With a six-year-old pageant queen at its core, and a family more willing to talk to media than police, it was the case that changed everything: David Lynch\u2019s Twin Peaks manifested in real life. Australian filmmaker Kitty Green was 12. She spent hours watching the bizarre true crime case unfurl into public obsession. \u201cIt was our summer holidays, but [in America] it was Christmas,\u201d she tells me at Berlinale, where her innovative \u201cdocumentary hybrid\u201d Casting JonBen\u00e9t recently screened. \u201cSo we had the whole month of January [free]. And we would just watch TV in the morning and see it all play out.\u201d The story left its mark, and stuck. But why? \u201cIt\u2019s been 20 years since it happened and yet it\u2019s still on the front cover of the tabloid magazines,\u201d Green says. \u201cI was fascinated by the cultural obsession, and why we can\u2019t let that story go. I really think it\u2019s a family story, something we can all relate to.\u201d Green\u2019s formative films had garnered praise at high profile festivals, including feature documentary Ukraine Is Not A Brothel (2013) and The Face of Ukraine: Casting Oksana Baiul \u2013 the short film which became a blueprint for Casting JonBen\u00e9t\u2019s powerful \u201ccasting call confessional\u201d format. As the 20th anniversary of the case loomed, Green decided to try to make a film about it. With the help of two indie film heavy-hitters \u2013 producers Scott Macaulay (Gummo) and James Schamus (Brokeback Mountain) \u2013 it became a reality. Casting JonBen\u00e9t is no midday movie. Nor is it a click-bait, quasi-forensic ratings-grabber tainted by the compromise of primetime TV. Instead, it is a deeply inventive, deeply complex look at a tragedy that struck a community. Green and crew recorded 300 hours of footage in Boulder over a 15-month period, editing on the fly. Seventy-five amateur/semi-professional actors from the local community \u2013 all touched by the case in some way \u2013 made audition tapes for a supposed docudrama, some scenes of which were shot and interwoven into the final film. Eager to please \u2013 and to play the various roles \u2013 they all share what they thought happened. The team elicits both riveting performances and interviews: funny, sad, emotional and, at times, shocking. Embracing the artifice of theatre, the intimacy of camera-confessional and the stylisation of drama, the film cannily and courageously uses meta-narrative to subvert both audience expectations and documentary form. A multiplicity of voices and viewpoints are heard. At heart it\u2019s a provocative and empathetic meditation on cinema, human tragedy, collective memory and how we each relate to grief, pain and loss. In effect, the film looks back at us. Archival footage of the Ramsey family is distinctly absent. \u201cThe family\u2019s suffering is inconceivable,\u201d Green explains. \u201cYou\u2019ll find 20 bad JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey movies [that have been] made over the years. \u201cThe aim was not to exploit JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey any further, but to close the book on her. We decided to stay away from the real family and just concentrate on the community around it [the case].\u201d Since world premiering at Sundance, Casting JonBen\u00e9t has been followed by five-star reviews \u2013 plus some reservations around how \u201cin on the final film\u201d the actors were. \u201cIt was a collaborative project,\u201d Green says definitively. \u201cFrom the beginning I told them a lot about exactly what I envisioned the film to be, and was very up front \u2013 that it was going to be a very constructed film, from their casting tapes and the re-enactments. \u201cIn some ways it felt like a community theatre piece\u2026 an ensemble piece. We\u2019re all in it together, which was really beautiful. Like we were all involved in \u2018the experiment\u2019, which is what we labeled it. \u201cSo it was this kind of evolving project and we were all just trying things out and taking risks, which was really incredible. I think everyone felt like they were part of \u2018something\u2019.\u201d Sometimes it takes a great work of art to remind us of the humanity inside a tragic, unfathomable event. Errol Morris\u2019s The Thin Blue Line is one such movie: Kitty Green\u2019s Casting JonBen\u00e9t is now another. \u201cA lot of people have come up to me and said that for the first time they can empathise with the family,\u201d says Green. \u201cNot because they thought they were \u2018guilty\u2019 or \u2018innocent\u2019, but just because [the film] humanised the tragedy in some way.\u201d \u201cRather than it just being a whodunnit, it became about a loss of life, which was really important to me.\u201d \u2022 Casting JonBen\u00e9t will screen on Netflix in April"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
