It depicted Ellen White, the star striker of the England women\u2019s football team, in her trademark scoring celebration: putting her fingers around her eyes to make goggles. The previous evening a record UK television audience of 7.6 million had watched White strike the pose after she scored England\u2019s second goal in their 3-0 victory against Norway in the World Cup quarter-final. Mark Willis, a local councillor and until last month the mayor of Aylesbury, was one of many on Friday who went to see the new street art, which is on the blank end of a parade of shops, between St Joseph\u2019s church and a nail bar called Jessica\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning,\u201d enthused Willis. \u201cThis part of town is a little bit tired, there\u2019s some empty shops, and that sort of thing just lifts it. It\u2019s put a smile on everyone\u2019s faces.\u201d On Tuesday, all eyes will be on the Aylesbury-born 30-year old England forward as she and the Lionesses face the USA in the semi-final in Lyon. Not least because she is in direct competition for the golden boot with USA forwards Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe. All three have five goals each in the competition so far. Fearsome Rapinoe, whose partner is American basketball player Sue Bird, has made a name for herself both on and off the pitch in the last few weeks. On Friday, having beaten host nation France to the semis, she declared \u201cGo gays!\u201d, before saying that \u201cyou can\u2019t win a championship without gays on your team\u201d. Earlier in the competition she began a row with US president Donald Trump after footage emerged of her declaring that she was \u201cnot going to the fucking White House\u201d should the USA win. The president lambasted her lack of respect on Twitter. The pressure is on for White, with a much lower public profile than Rapinoe, to add more goals to her total than her rival. \u201cEllen is, I wouldn\u2019t say a household name, but pretty well known in the town,\u201d said Willis. \u201cAnd having a young woman \u2013 and we know there\u2019s an issue with young women doing sport and exercise \u2013 born in the town, reaching the highest level, is so inspirational. It has a real effect when you have someone who is from exactly the same circumstances as you are making it to the top.\u201d In many ways the hope is that girls interested in football now will have a very different experience from the one that White had when she was starting out in the 1990s. She came to football through her father, Jon, who organised a mini-league academy in Aylesbury, where boys and girls played together. Her skill and determination stood out from the beginning and, at the age of eight, she attracted the interest of Arsenal, then the pioneering team in women\u2019s football in England. At 10, White was playing for Aylesbury Town in the Chiltern Youth League, still mixing it with the boys. And she was thriving, scoring more than 100 goals in the league. But then came a hitch. Officials from the league told White that she was now too old to play mixed football. Her father was furious, fearing it would either stunt her development or make her lose interest in the game. He complained that the decision was \u201cnot helping development of women\u2019s football\u201d. It also risked being \u201ca waste of talent\u201d. Fortunately White did remain engaged, and she has now made 86 appearances for England and this is her third World Cup. In 2011, after a strong showing in the group stages, the Lionesses crashed out on penalties to France in the quarter-finals (with White unfortunate to miss a good chance in extra time). Four years later, at the 2015 World Cup in Canada, England made it to the semis, but Japan were too strong. The hope, in 2019, is that a core of the England team are fit and at their peak: not just White, but class act Lucy Bronze, the marauding right back, and 32-year-old midfielder Jill Scott, so integral that she alone seems to be above manager Phil Neville\u2019s controversial rotation policy. \u201cWe want to inspire and to build a legacy,\u201d said Neville. \u201cWe had a camp last year and we set out the objectives for the next 12 months, and all I wanted them to say was \u2018win the World Cup\u2019. But they were thinking bigger than winning a World Cup, which knocked me in my stride a little bit. We want the Lionesses to have a name that people around the world can relate to \u2026 badass women. That was our mantra.\u201d There\u2019s already been some clamour in Aylesbury to temporarily rename the town \u201cEllsbury\u201d in honour of the local sensation. Willis, for one, thinks the idea has merit. \u201cEllsbury \u2026 I\u2019m sure we could do that, particularly if she scores the winner in the final,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cWe\u2019ll make that happen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
