Companies face a \u00a310,000 fine if they refuse to comply with restrictions ordering the closure of pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, gyms and all non-essential retailers. Regulations setting out the new laws in England are due to be published on Tuesday before being put to a vote by MPs on Wednesday. If passed, as expected, the measures would come into effect at 12.01am on Thursday. While the vast majority of businesses are expected to comply with the rules, a small number have publicly vowed to flout them. The beauty salon in Bootle, Merseyside, whose owners have denied the existence of coronavirus, said it would open as usual on Thursday and fight any fine through the courts. A message on the Instagram page of Skin Kerr said: \u201cWe will not be locking down again. We will remain open. We will fight this and any fines in a common law court.\u201d The owner of the salon previously described the pandemic as a \u201cbullshit voodoo virus\u201d and displayed posters saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t catch what doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d as well as banning masks and \u201cCovid talk\u201d. The salon did not respond to a request to comment. It posted a clip on Instagram on Sunday of the conspiracy theorist David Icke calling Covid-19 \u201ca scam\u201d and urging businesses to \u201csimply refuse to lock down\u201d. A martial arts gym in Wigan has also vowed to stay open. In a Facebook post, the Majestic Gym claimed it was \u201ccleaner and safer than any supermarket, fast food outlet or anywhere else that is allowed to stay open\u201d and called on other businesses to \u201crefuse to obey the tyranny\u201d. Kevin Harper, the gym\u2019s owner, said his facility was \u201ccleaner than an operating theatre\u201d and that gyms were \u201cas important as churches, hospitals, pubs and restaurants\u201d so should be allowed to stay open. He said he would fight any fine and \u201cclog the legal system\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve not broken any laws. I have not injured anybody. I have not hurt anybody. That will be my legal argument. And on Thursday morning when I open up at 9.30 the police will be here, I guarantee, and I welcome them. These are not criminal matters. It\u2019s preposterous.\u201d Harper, who has run the gym for 12 years, falsely claimed that there was \u201cno categorical scientific proof that coronavirus even exists\u201d but that he had a rigorous safety process in place, including temperature checks on arrival, strict social distancing and a \u201c50-page risk assessment\u201d. He added: \u201cWhen we did that first lockdown, I nearly went bankrupt. I can\u2019t afford to do that again. I\u2019m not being selfish, I\u2019m being realistic. I\u2019ll switch salaries with the prime minister, if he wants to take my \u00a3750 a month that I\u2019m currently getting. I\u2019m not going to be able to survive. I\u2019ve got children. My wife\u2019s pregnant. I\u2019ve no choice but to stay open.\u201d Police chiefs are bracing themselves for potentially worse compliance among a weary public than during the first lockdown. Officers across the UK were called out to rule-breaking raves and house parties over the Halloween weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
