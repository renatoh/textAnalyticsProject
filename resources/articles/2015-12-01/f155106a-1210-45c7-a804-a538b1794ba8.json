Had he done so a few weeks earlier, the New Jersey governor\u2019s confidence may have appeared as awkward as his sci-fi entrance. Then, he languished at the back of the national pack of presidential hopefuls. But Christie\u2019s campaign in New Hampshire is drawing energy from recent polls showing him now jostling in the state with Marco Rubio \u2013 both behind a frontrunner, Donald Trump, who some believe may be brought down to earth by Ted Cruz the week before, in the Iowa caucus. Both early voting states are expected to play an even more important role than usual in the 2016 election, winnowing out a Republican field whose size has hampered attempts to compete with Trump for media attention. \u201cYou are the most powerful people in America,\u201d Christie told an enthusiastic crowd of New Hampshire voters at a truck service centre in Exeter. \u201cYou are going to take this race from 14 people to four or five. After you vote, 10 of us go home. You are going to get to choose who the other 48 states get to choose from.\u201d Unlike his conservative rivals, the more politically moderate Christie has wasted little time on states like Iowa and poured all of his resources into an all-or-nothing strategy to shine in New Hampshire. Saturday marked his 53rd day in the state during this campaign \u2013 more time on the ground here, he claims, than any other candidate \u2013 and brought his 38th local town hall meeting. Christie is also using his establishment pedigree as former chair of the Republican Governors\u2019 Association to maximum effect, enlisting support from both Maryland governor Larry Hogan and the governor of the neighbouring state of Maine, Paul LePage, during the trip. \u201cCome on, fire it up,\u201d said New Hampshire\u2019s senate majority leader Jeb Bradley as the crowd waited for Christie\u2019s tour bus to pull into the garage. \u201cWe\u2019re here to elect a president \u2026 It\u2019s a big job for a big person.\u201d The outsized New Jersey governor was once seen as a leading contender for the 2016 nomination, thanks to a record of bipartisan appeal in his strongly Democratic home state and a history of cooperating with President Obama in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. But a famous hug with Obama and subsequent scandal involving denying motorists access to a New Jersey bridge in an alleged act of political payback \u2013 in which he was never directly implicated \u2013 has tarnished his national reputation among both conservatives and liberals. \u201cMy original thought was I couldn\u2019t vote for somebody from New Jersey \u2013 you know they have this reputation,\u201d admitted former New Hampshire state representative Donna Sytek in the warm-up event, before rescuing another potentially awkward moment. \u201cWe are longing for somebody who can beat Hillary Clinton, and that person is Chris Christie,\u201d she quickly added. The former prosecutor\u2019s political appeal now rests firmly on a hawkish national security message and a claim to be a political outsider who has more executive experience than the insiders. \u201cWashington is a strange place. Stay away until we put adult supervision back into Washington DC,\u201d said Christie, who brought his four children, wife and father along as if to prove his grown-up credentials. \u201cIf you are looking for someone you agree with 100% of the time, go home and look in the mirror because you\u2019re it. We need to do more than wring our hands.\u201d The crowd in Exeter included many veterans and Christie warmed to a security theme he developed in Tuesday\u2019s Republican debate in Las Vegas. \u201cWe used to control events; now events control us,\u201d he warned. \u201cThat\u2019s why the world is coming apart at the seams and we can feel it.\u201d Some of the anger was directed at Obama, and by extension his former secretary of state, Clinton. \u201cI saw that the president said the reason he don\u2019t understand the anxiety Americans felt after Paris and San Bernardino was because he didn\u2019t watch enough cable news,\u201d said Christie, in reference to a New York Times report of an off-the-record presidential briefing that was subsequently removed from the paper. \u201cMr President, you don\u2019t need to watch cable news if you have real-life experience.\u201d But the real bite was reserved for Republican rivals who Christie made clear he felt were woefully under-qualified to be commander-in-chief. First in the firing line was Rubio, criticised for missing a US Senate vote on the $1.15tn budget this week. \u201cSenator Rubio, if you are opposed to something, how about showing up to work and voting no?\u201d said Christie. \u201cAnother one of my opponents says he is gong to carpet bomb Syria to see if sand can glow,\u201d he added, in reference to Cruz, whom he also criticised for backing surveillance reform: \u201cWow, that\u2019s tough talk. But Senator Cruz voted to weaken America and make it more vulnerable.\u201d Trump was, oddly, not mentioned by name, and instead dismissively referred to as \u201ca real character\u201d who was \u201cleading from fear, to protect his poll numbers\u201d. \u201cBoy, have we been entertaining,\u201d said Christie of the race so far. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun to watch, but showtime is over. It\u2019s time to pick a president. We are not picking an entertainer-in-chief. This is not showtime. This is real. \u201cI am the old truck in this race,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThey are a bunch of shiny new trucks in this race but they haven\u2019t been in the mud. They haven\u2019t been tested.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
