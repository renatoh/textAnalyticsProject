That's why I tend not to sit here and picture someone opening an envelope and saying: 'The 2018 World Cup goes to \u2026 England'.\" As the man who galvanised London's once moribund 2012 Olympic bid into a triumphant campaign, Coe has a strong sense of the requirements needed to stage a World Cup. As one of Britain's greatest middle-distance runners, he also tasted victory, and defeat, in various Olympic finals. His memories of the narrow margin between those outcomes still mark him \u2013 especially as he shared both elation and despair with his father and former coach, Peter, who died on the eve of the Beijing Olympics last August. Coe might have been a member of the 2018 team for only a couple of months, but does he really believe England will win the bid? \"My gut says yes,\" Coe murmurs, \"but it's going to be a long slog. If we get the messaging and narrative right, and we work so hard that there is nowhere else to go, then, yes, of course England can win the World Cup bid. But bids deserve nothing. You have to make a compelling case, which resonates in international terms.\" Near the end of another draining day, it's possible to hear a grain of weariness in Coe's voice. As chairman of Locog, the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, his remit is vast and exhausting. He is bound up so personally in delivering a successful Olympics that failure in 2012 would scar him, and undermine his chances of eventually slipping into the role of IOC president that has apparently been earmarked for him. But he has decided to stretch himself still further. \"I don't bid for a hobby,\" he says wryly, \"and normally I wouldn't have done another. But I feel strongly about it and I've always believed that bringing a World Cup to this country would complete the most extraordinary decade of sport we might ever have. We could go from 2012 to 2014 and the Commonwealth Games in Scotland to 2018. On the back of that, if we can't do things for the long-term benefit of British sport and society, we should be shot. \"Football is also one of my passions, and my weekends feel empty if I don't go to a game [to watch Chelsea]. So I always knew, if I was asked to make a sensible contribution, it would be hard for me to say no. As long as people understood I couldn't do this in the way I've immersed myself in 2012, then I would be comfortable making targeted contributions to a very smart team. And from my first couple of meetings I can say we're pretty much where we should be at this point of the campaign.\" Coe acknowledges some of the public relations disasters that scuppered England's 2006 World Cup bid. \"I wasn't close to the process but I can see how the 'Football's coming home' theme alienated some countries. You need to make delegates feel comfortable with what you stand for through your consistency of message and ability to deliver. Eventually people cease looking at you as a bidding country \u2013 they focus on you purely as an organising committee. They think: 'Can we rely on them for six years?' It's vital people feel confident and comfortable when they consider your campaign.\" He pauses when asked to identify England's most formidable rivals in the bidding race. \"Spain clearly has a good track record. The game is also growing dramatically in Australia. But at this level there are few bad bids. As I learnt from the Olympic process, it can come down to the delegates' gut reaction at the very end.\" Another gut reaction is that the English game is divided by a chasm between the Football Association and the Premier League. Coe might be seen as a consensus figure but how can he help unite such conflicting camps? \"Give me a chance,\" he jokes. \"I've only been doing this a few weeks. But Dave Richards has joined the board so there is Premier League input, and we've got a well- structured team that includes Keith Mills, my mentor and the chief executive of the 2012 bid.\" In his evocative closing speech in Singapore, which clinched the 2012 vote, Coe placed the concept of legacy at the core of his pitch. Does he now share concerns that London's planned Olympic legacy is slipping away? \"No,\" he insists. \"This is not an easy process, and we've set legacy targets that have never been set before. No other city came to the table with the concept of building an 80,000-seat stadium which could be demounted to a manageable legacy of 25,000 in the inner city. We're far further down the path than anything achieved by other cities.\" He is vague when asked whether that down-scaled Olympic stadium might be used by a football or rugby club on a regular basis after 2012. \"I'm not quite sure where the legacy discussions have got to with the LDA [London Development Agency] on that issue. The stadium's primary purpose is track and field, and we shouldn't be ashamed of that. Sporting aspirations have always been massive in east London, without matching facilities, and we're doing that community a great service. Don't forget it's also taken an Olympic Games to bring a 50m swimming pool to London. With three-and-a-half years left, progress is being made and we certainly don't want a two-week Wimbledon effect. We're looking to create something lasting.\" The semantics surrounding 2012 have shifted since last August. Coe might have hailed Beijing as \"a spectacular Games\" that London would equal, but ambition has since been downgraded from an \"intimate\" to a \"functional\" Olympics. \"I don't use any of those words,\" Coe retorts. \"We're pursuing the same vision we set out in Singapore. We brought our business partners to the table very early and that's given us the clarity and certainty to move from planning to the operational phase \u2013 despite the economic downturn. It has also given us a financial cushion.\" Coe's passion, by now, is plain. \"It really matters to me that we do it well,\" he says. \"This has got to be so good and so meaningful and so relevant to people. It has to offer a great celebration and an enduring legacy \u2013 and I believe it will.\" In his new book, the 52-year-old Coe lays out the principles shaping his success on and off the track. At the heart of his narrative, an intriguing story unfolds in the relationship between Coe and his father. Coe has often been dismissed as a moneyed toff, yet his family life was more layered. His mother was an actress of Indian descent and his father was a working-class Londoner. \"I'm not sure what my dad made of me ending up a Conservative,\" Coe says. \"He was a great trade unionist in his formative years and very involved in worker education in east London. He never lost that \u2013 even if he had a low opinion of politicians and party politics. In his last years, when he'd virtually lost his sight, I would spend most Sunday afternoons reading great chunks of the newspaper to him because he was still so engaged in the world.\" The intimacy of that scene, with a middle-aged man reading the Sunday papers to his nearly blind father, makes a poignant contrast with the searing image of Peter Coe driving his young son relentlessly on the track. It perhaps explains why, in his book, Coe refers more to \"my coach\" than \"my father\". He nods thoughtfully. \"It's a really good observation because we did try to compartmentalise our relationship. There were times when it was uncomfortable \u2013 especially when you're 14 and a man grabs your father at a cross-country course and starts yelling. He was pointing at me and saying: 'You're killing him.' My dad said: 'Yes, I'm killing him right the way to the top'.\" They did reach \"the top\", as Peter Coe always planned, but even at the pinnacle there were some desolate defeats. The most painful occurred in 1980, when Coe crumbled mentally in his supreme discipline, the 800m, and was defeated by his arch-rival, Steve Ovett, in the Moscow Olympics. His father berated him in public and told the press he was \"ashamed\". Coe shakes his head. \"It was too subtle for journalistic currency,\" he says. \"He didn't mean he was ashamed of me. He was saying: 'I don't absolve myself. I am also accountable for this failure.' And to the day he died he blamed himself for not taking a grip of the situation 12 hours before. He could've said: 'Look, you are the fastest man on the planet at this distance. There is nothing you can't handle'.\" A few days later Coe won gold in his less-favoured 1500m. He successfully defended that Olympic title in 1984 but his Moscow defeat remains the burning memory because Seb and Peter Coe were both bent on winning. Last August, with death closing in, Coe was at his father's bedside. \"Dad timed it perfectly because, as I stood there with my brother and sister, the Beijing Olympics were about to start. He had been unconscious for three days but I knew what his view would have been. My brother and sister felt the same. If he had seen us he would have said: 'Why on earth are you lot here? You've got lives to lead.' And so I left and took the plane to Beijing just as the opening ceremony began. He died soon afterwards but I knew he wanted me to go because it was my job. 'Go on,' he would have said. 'You've got work to do'.\" Sebastian Coe's The Winning Mind is published by Headline (\u00a314.99)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
