The last Test match at Carisbrook, the \"House of Pain\" of New Zealand legend, had done its stuff by pointing to Wales's lack of resources. With the centre James Hook having stayed at home to have an operation on his damaged shoulder, his replacement, Andrew Bishop, and Jones were sent to hospital for x-rays on damaged hands. The results for Jones were inconclusive and he will undergo further tests, but Bishop's hand is in a cast and he will not play for four weeks. On top of the beating handed out by the All Blacks, that was the last thing Wales wanted to hear. The Wales physiotherapist, Mark Davies, said: \"Andrew has a spiral fracture to the third metacarpal bone in his right hand. The injury is not complex but he is in plaster and will be out of action for the next four weeks. Stephen has a sore thumb. He has been X-rayed but the initial results are inconclusive and we are arranging for a further scan to fully determine the extent of the injury.\" No replacement will be called in for Bishop but a decision will be made on Jones, and any potential replacement for the Scarlets fly-half, within 24 hours. The scrum-half Mike Phillips switched to centre when Bishop was forced off on Saturday, as Jonathan Davies, the back-up centre, had already come on to the field. With Davies now likely to join Jamie Roberts in the centres on Saturday, the young Dragons back Will Harries could find himself on the replacements bench, if the Wales coach, Warren Gatland, chooses to stick with his starting back three of Lee Byrne, Tom Prydie and Leigh Halfpenny. The Welsh squad are also smarting from the way the team conceded 27 unanswered points in the second half at Carisbrook. The All Black fly-half Dan Carter, who is almost back to his best, led the way with two tries in a total of 27 points as Welsh resistance crumbled after a brave first half in which they monopolised possession and territory. From two attacks, however, the All Blacks scored two tries to lead by six points at the interval. They then upped the pace to leave Wales physically and mentally drained. \"We keep saying you only learn by playing the best and there are a lot of positives for us,\" Gatland said. His full\u2011back, Byrne, was closer to the truth when he said: \"It will be a test of our character now.\" New Zealand: Dagg (Highlanders; Kahui, Chiefs, ht); Jane, Smith (both Hurricanes), Stanley, Rokocoko (both Blues); Carter (Crusaders; Cruden, Hurricanes, 72), Cowan (Highlanders; Weepu, Hurricanes, 59); B Franks (Crusaders; Woodcock, Blues, 45), Mealamu (Blues; De Malmanche, Chiefs, 59), O Franks, Thorn (both Crusaders), Boric (Blues; Whitelock, Crusaders, 56), Vito (Hurricanes), McCaw (Crusaders, capt), Read (Crusaders; Thomson, Highlanders 70).
