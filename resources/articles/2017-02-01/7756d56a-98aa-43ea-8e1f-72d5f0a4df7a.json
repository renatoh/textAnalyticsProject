Minichiello, who guided Ennis-Hill to Olympic heptathlon gold and three world titles, faces censure this week after a blazing row with the woman athlete at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield in December, during which he said: \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed on this track, fuck off, fuck off, fuck off.\u201d But Minichiello, who was named coach of the year by the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards in 2012, insists the accusations are \u201cinsulting and inaccurate\u201d and believes he has been unfairly treated by British Athletics because he has often been critical of the sport\u2019s governing body. The Guardian knows the identity of the athlete, who is not Ennis-Hill but had trained with Minichiello for over a decade. In her letter of complaint to British Athletics she said relations broke down after she left his coaching group last year but had come to a head before the new year. In the letter she wrote: \u201cAfter my session I was sitting on the floor packing my bag whilst chatting to an athlete who was stretching. Antonio interrupted the conversation once to ask how long she would be after we continued to chat. He then came over shouting: \u2018Get off the track, you\u2019re not allowed on here and it\u2019s my track, fuck off.\u2019 \u201cI responded by telling him British Athletics hire the track not him and I\u2019ve been given permission to use it. Antonio screamed over the top of me: \u2018You\u2019re not allowed on this track, fuck off, fuck off, fuck off,\u2019 as I was upset and he wasn\u2019t engaging in conversation when I tried to speak to him reasonably.\u201d The athlete said she had reported the incident to the duty manager of the track, adding: \u201cI have asked some athletes for witness statements but all refuse to give them through fear of losing their coach and one can assume general fear after seeing how he spoke to me. \u201cAntonio also needs to be made aware that for anyone, but especially a female, having a grown man aggressively scream over you is threatening, intimidating and upsetting. It\u2019s certainly created a very unpleasant work place for myself and others. The young female athletes who witnessed the event also need to have confidence in the fact that such behaviour won\u2019t go unchallenged, not be tolerated and that they have a voice that will be heard should they encounter such treatment towards them in the future.\u201d When the Guardian spoke to Minichiello he insisted the row was \u201cprobably one argument in 15 years of a relationship\u201d and insisted the letter did not accurately reflect how he treated his athletes. \u201cIf you look at my record of supporting Jessica Ennis-Hill and defending her after Charles van Commenee\u2019s comments about her being out of shape in 2011, or when people inside the sport said she couldn\u2019t come back after her pregnancy, it shows my reputation in terms of defending women and supporting women\u2019s athletics,\u201d he said. \u201cI have always worked my damnedest to make my athletes achieve success and their dreams in whatever way is best appropriate. Look at Katy Marchand, who moved from training with me to winning a cycling bronze medal in Rio. Does that letter smack of what I am actually like? I honestly don\u2019t think it does. \u201cAs a coach I have always worked as hard as I can for all my athletes - we are in this to succeed together and it is disappointing when any coach-and-athlete relationship comes to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand her frustration but I think the letter is insulting and inaccurate.\u201d Minichiello also rejected suggestions he is a tough coach, saying that while he always pushed his athletes to achieve more than they ever thought was possible, he has never bullied them. \u201cI think I am a fair, honest and straight-batting coach,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t lie to my athletes and neither will I gild the lily. In her book Jess said we had a \u2018love/hate relationship that has caused me more tears, pain and ultimately joy than I have ever dreaded or wished for\u2019 \u2013 she was talking about all the hard training we did together. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a coach in this country who doesn\u2019t work their hardest for the athlete to achieve success and for it to end in an argument is a shame.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
