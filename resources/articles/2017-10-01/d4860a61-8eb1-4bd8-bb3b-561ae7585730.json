Teaching boys to be feminists gives them a sense of justice and empathy and helps them \u201cescape the pressure to be a particular kind of masculine\u201d that is damaging to men and those around them, Trudeau writes. \u201cI want them to be comfortable being themselves, and being feminists \u2013 who stand up for what\u2019s right, and who can look themselves in the eye with pride.\u201d Trudeau said he had been thinking about how to raise his daughter, Ella-Grace, as a feminist when his wife, Sophie, reminded him that their sons Xavier and Hadrien needed to be advocates for women as well. \u201cAll of us benefit when women and girls have the same opportunities as men and boys \u2013 and it\u2019s on all of us to make that a reality,\u201d he wrote in an essay for Marie Claire magazine. \u201cOur sons have the power and the responsibility to change our culture of sexism.\u201d Feminism, noted Trudeau, was not just the belief that men and women are equal. \u201cIt\u2019s the knowledge that when we are all equal, all of us are more free.\u201d Trudeau, 45, frequently describes himself as a feminist. After taking power in 2015, he drew global attention by appointing a cabinet with an equal number of men and women. This year his government followed in the footsteps of Sweden in adopting what it called a feminist policy toward foreign aid. As his government approaches two years in power, however, it has been critised for failing to transform Trudeau\u2019s pronouncements on gender equality into concrete actions aimed at addressing the challenges facing Canadian women. As many as 4,000 indigenous women have gone missing or been murdered in the past three decades, while the number of indigenous women in prison has soared. Childcare costs in Canada rank among the highest in the OECD, while a persistent pay gap has sent the country tumbling to 35th place in the World Economic Forum\u2019s global gender gap rankings. While his government has committed to presenting pay equity legislation for federally regulated sectors, it has said it will not do so until 2018. Trudeau\u2019s essay, penned to mark the UN\u2019s International Day of the Girl, comes months after his wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, set off a social media firestorm after suggesting that women celebrate International Women\u2019s Day by highlighting boys and men who promote gender equality. At the time, many blasted Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau\u2019s stance \u2013 posted on several social media sites \u2013 for being tone deaf. Others juxtaposed Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau\u2019s words with her husband\u2019s actions. \u201cIf your husband were a true feminist and, by your own definition isn\u2019t \u2018afraid to speak up in front of others\u2019, he would denounce Trump personally and his administration\u2019s misogyny. Until he does, he\u2019s a lip-service feminist and I can\u2019t take him seriously as a fighter for the cause,\u201d noted one response to Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau\u2019s post. The publication of Trudeau\u2019s essay coincided with his visit to Washington DC, where he met with Donald Trump, who has come under heavy criticism for his attitudes toward women. During his campaign to become president, a videotape was released in which he could be heard bragging about groping and having sex with women. Since taking power, his administration has proposed or undertaken measures curbing women\u2019s rights, particularly in the areas of abortion access, health insurance, childcare and workplace policies. Last week, his administration stripped out requirements under the Obama-era Affordable Care Act law that required employers to provide insurance to cover women\u2019s birth control."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
