The two books might be seen as siblings, though Earthlings would definitely be the evil twin. Both feature young women who reject society\u2019s expectations and seek comfort in replacement forms of community. For Keiko in Convenience Store Woman, it was the reassuringly uniform, striplit security of the shop where she had worked all her adult life. For 10-year-old Natsuki in Earthlings, it\u2019s the imaginary planet Popinpobopia, which she believes to be her destiny, at least according to her cuddly toy Piyyut. So far, so kawaii, but the cute whimsy unrolled before the reader in the opening pages turns out to be covering a trapdoor. Natsuki conjures a makeshift family out of Piyyut and her cousin Yuu because her existing family doesn\u2019t work. Her mother calls her \u201chopeless \u2026 she\u2019s like a weight around my neck\u201d. Natsuki and Yuu carry out a mock marriage, pledging to one another to \u201csurvive, whatever it takes\u201d. Surviving might take more resources than Natsuki can muster, and she can\u2019t even bear to spell things out. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words that things are just a little bit not OK.\u201d When a student teacher at her school begins to prey on her in the grimmest way (\u201cDo you know what a BJ is, Natsuki?\u201d), she hasn\u2019t the spirit to resist \u2013 at first. But no pressure can build up indefinitely. Twenty years later, Natsuki is in a sexless marriage of convenience, and views society as \u201cthe Factory\u201d, a programme for breeding further humans. Popinpobopia seems very far away. \u201cAll I can do is keep my head down and pretend to be an Earthling.\u201d At this point the book switches from muted tones to a Technicolor explosion, as Murata throws in a convulsion of sudden shocks including murder, necrophilia and cannibalism. This is a high-risk move: it takes a story about not fitting in and turns it into a sort of freak show \u2013 even though it\u2019s hinted that the Grand Guignol grotesqueries of these scenes aren\u2019t really happening. But whatever Earthlings is, whatever planet it comes from, it\u2019s a tale of quiet desperation to make your brain fizz. \u2022 Earthlings by Sayaka Murata, translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori, is published by Granta (\u00a312.99).
