Thanks for reading this Europa League Clockwatch. Make sure to come back for our coverage of the draw for the Round of 32 on Monday. Nighty night! Celtic put in their best performance of the season at Parkhead. Too late for Europe, but their confidence-boosting win over Lille might stand them in good stead domestically. Here\u2019s Ewan Murray. Spurs ensured the glory of top spot in their group by beating Antwerp. Tumaini Carayol was our man at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and here\u2019s his verdict. Some blessed relief for under-fire Mikel Arteta as Arsenal saw off Dundalk. Here come the match reports on a successful night for British teams in the Europa League. First up Rangers, who were very impressive again as they beat Lech Poznan 2-0. The seeded teams ahead of the Round of 32 draw on Monday: Roma, Arsenal, Bayer Leverkusen, Rangers, PSV, Napoli, Leicester, Milan, Villarreal, Spurs, Dinamo Zagreb, Hoffenheim, Manchester United, Brugge, Shakhtar Donetsk, Ajax. They\u2019ll all draw one of this unseeded lot: Young Boys, Molde, Slavia Prague, Benfica, Granada, Real Sociedad, Braga, Lille, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Antwerp, Wolfsberger, Red Star Belgrade, Krasnodar, Red Bull Salzburg, Dynamo Kyiv, Olympiacos. This was over a long time ago. Leicester ease past AEK to ensure they top the group and avoid the big boys in next week\u2019s draw. They had to work for it, but Spurs secure the win they needed to top their group and join the seeds in Monday\u2019s draw. Too little, too late for Celtic in Europe, but they take their leave of the continental stage with a valedictory win. That\u2019ll release some of the pressure on Neil Lennon and give the Bhoys a bhoost ahead of some crucial domestic fixtures. Leicester 2-0 AEK. Leicester spurn another chance to gild the lily. Justin romps down the right and crosses for Barnes, 12 yards out. Barnes creams his volley over the bar. But again, no matter: Leicester are a couple of added minutes away from securing top spot. Spurs 2-0 Antwerp. Kane wants a goal. To this end, he twists and turns down the inside-left channel, carving out a chance on the corner of the six-yard box. But he slips at the vital moment. Falling, he still manages to improvise a diagonal prod, but the ball squirts wide right of goal. No matter, really, because Spurs are home and hosed. Leicester 2-0 AEK. The Foxes break, three on one. Perez zips down the right and slips the ball inside for Praet, who is teed up on the penalty spot. All he has to do is sweep home ... but a miraculous last-ditch saving tackle by Galanopoulous saves the day for AEK! That really should have been the cherry on the cake, but what an interception! Leicester 2-0 AEK. Leicester have been on easy street since that early double, but they were nearly facing a nervous ending here. Oliveira races into the box down the left and makes a mug of Morgan, but having turned his man, lashes wildly over from the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. He should at the very least have worked Ward in the Leicester goal. Celtic 3-2 Lille. Celtic\u2019s aforementioned defensive woes surface again, their back line split in two with great ease, Lihadji released into the box down the middle. He has to score, but takes a fresh-air swipe at the rolling ball, allowing Hazard in the Celtic goal to clear. What a let-off. Celtic 3-2 Lille. \u201cCeltic have looked half decent tonight, with Turnbull, Soro and Henderson in particular staking a claim,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cDespite only managing a single point in the group before tonight, Celtic have actually led in four of the matches. Take away the 75 goals they\u2019ve conceded and they\u2019re in a pretty strong position.\u201d Spurs 2-0 Antwerp. So Mourinho has used up all of his subs. Dele Alli, having realised he\u2019s not going to get a run-out, follows Winks down the tunnel. A few man-management tasks await Jose, by the looks of things. Celtic may get that feelgood win after all! Ajer twists and turns down the right, reaching the byline and pulling back for Turnbull, who rifles low and hard into the net from 12 yards! A lovely run by Ajer and a fine crisp finish too. Spurs look to have secured top spot in Group J! Sissoko wins a turnover in the centre circle. He slips forward for Kane, who shuttles the ball on to Lo Celso, releasing him down the inside-right. Lo Celso, who has been Tottenham\u2019s star turn tonight, draws the keeper and eases a chip over him and into the net. A free kick for Lille out on the right. The ever-impressive Yazici curls it in. Celtic only half clear. The ball drops to Weah, just inside the box, a little left of centre. He pearls a volley into the bottom left, and Celtic\u2019s hopes of a little confidence booster as they leave the European stage take a huge knock. Leicester 2-0 AEK. So having said that, Barnes springs into life and embarks on a power skitter down the left, cutting infield and lashing a low diagonal shot inches wide of the bottom right. Applause from Rodgers. That would have been a lovely goal. Leicester 2-0 AEK. Nothing much going on at the King Power, and Brendan Rodgers will be more than happy about it. The Foxes are comfortably holding on to top spot in Group G. Spurs 1-0 Antwerp. Harry Winks was also substituted as Mourinho made a triple change. Tanguy Ndombele took his place. Winks wasn\u2019t happy at all, and went straight down the tunnel with a face on. Spurs 1-0 Antwerp. Bale and Vinicius, their work done, are replaced by Kane and Son. Spurs have a couple of big away days coming up in the next seven days - at Palace and then Liverpool - but first things first. Spurs hadn\u2019t been playing well before the goal, and Mourinho had clearly decided enough was enough. A sure sign that he\u2019s taking the Europa League very seriously, and wants seeding in Monday\u2019s draw at all costs. Spurs get some reward from the situation, though! Bale takes the free kick, 30 yards out, and whips a sensational effort over the wall and towards the top right. Beiranvand does magnificently to divert the fierce goalbound shot onto the post, but the ball bounces back across the face of goal, and it\u2019s a simple tap-in for Vinicius! Spurs will now top the group if things stay the same. Spurs 0-0 Antwerp. Visiting defender Seck is already on a yellow, and shoves an in-flight Moura in the back. Spurs want a second yellow. The referee isn\u2019t interested, but does show Jose Mourinho one, for complaining a little too loudly about it. Spurs 0-0 Antwerp. Other than that, very little has occurred in N17 since the restart. The Belgians will be more than happy with the way this is going right now. Spurs 0-0 Antwerp. Visiting keeper Beiranvand takes it to the edge with the ball at his feet, dropping a shoulder and dribbling around the charging Vinicius before clearing. Nerves of steel. Celtic 2-1 Lille. The visitors start the second half on the front foot. Yazici goes on a hell of a dribble down the inside-right channel, eating up much of the pitch and making it into the box. He can\u2019t quite fashion enough space to get a proper shot away, which is kind of sad given the brilliance of the run. Celtic fans are unlikely to care too much about aesthetic beauty in this particular instance. The games restart in Glasgow, Leicester and London. Big second halves coming up for Leicester and Spurs, who will be hoping to top their respective groups and earn seeding in the draw for the Round of 256 or whatever the field\u2019s been pared down to. That\u2019s Leicester\u2019s to lose; Spurs still have some work to do. Celtic meanwhile are simply playing for pride, and a wee boost ahead of a crucial domestic period that could define their season. Half-time entertainment. Of sorts. Celtic 2-1 Lille Leicester 2-0 AEK Spurs 0-0 Antwerp As things stand, Leicester will go through as group winners, but Spurs won\u2019t be seeded in next Monday\u2019s draw. Antwerp are in the box seat in Group J. Spurs 0-0 Antwerp. Beiranvand makes yet another big save, denying Vinicius, who was free down the inside-left channel and should really have scored. The keeper smothers his chip, and takes a whack in the fruit bowl for his trouble. He\u2019ll be fine to continue once the sting subsides and the inventory has been completed to his satisfaction. Leicester 2-0 AEK. ... while things are gently ticking over in the midlands. Celtic 2-1 Lille. Meanwhile it\u2019s all quiet in Glasgow ... Spurs 0-0 Antwerp. Spurs are finally baring their teeth. Moura drives hard down the inside-right channel and flicks forward for Bale, who dribbles past two defenders, draws the keeper, but can\u2019t find a white shirt in the middle with his flick from the byline. Spurs 0-0 Antwerp. A glorious run in from the left by Lo Celso, featuring a dazzling array of shimmies, shakes, shoulder drops, dummies and feints. He ends with a curler towards the top right. Beiranvand again saves the day, this time with a full-stretch fingertip save. That would have been some goal. Spurs 0-0 Antwerp. I knew that would do it. Spurs nearly take the lead, Lo Celso scampering into acres down the left and looking for Vinicius, all alone in the middle. The pass isn\u2019t perfect, and it allows the keeper Beiranvand to hare out and slide clear. The ball breaks to Doherty, but he\u2019s swarmed by red shirts before he can even think about dispatching the ball into the unguarded net from 40 yards. Spurs 0-0 Antwerp. I haven\u2019t described much action from this match, have I? Well, there\u2019s a reason for that. Celtic 2-1 Lille. That\u2019s some way for McGregor to atone for the error that led to Lille\u2019s equaliser. Meanwhile poor Frimpong can\u2019t continue, and he\u2019s replaced by Henderson. It\u2019s all happening at Parkhead! Frimpong dribbles with purpose into the box from the right. He\u2019s unceremoniously clipped. A sore one, and he has to pop to the bench to get some treatment. Meanwhile McGregor slots the penalty that\u2019s awarded into the bottom right! Well that didn\u2019t last long. An awful mishit backpass by McGregor is intercepted by Yazici, who drives down the left and rolls across for Jonathan Ikone, who can\u2019t miss from six yards. Neil Lennon needs some good news as well, and here it comes! A corner out on the left. It\u2019s sent to the near post, and met by Christopher Jullien, who runs an elaborate route to escape his marker and glances home cleverly with a cute back-header. Spurs 0-0 Antwerp. Ah here\u2019s some good news. Tanganga\u2019s injury wasn\u2019t as serious as it initially looked, and the promising young defender is good to continue. Celtic 0-0 Lille. The French side nearly take the lead, Yazici taking a free kick just to the left of the D and whistling it towards the top-left corner. Not sure Conor Hazard in the Celtic goal had that covered, but thankfully for Neil Lennon\u2019s side, the ball clears the crossbar. Just. Spurs 0-0 Antwerp. Worrying scenes as poor Japhet Tanganga goes down clutching his shoulder. He stays down. The physios are on, and taking a long, hard look. This could be a long night for AEK. Barnes cuts in from the left and tries a curler towards the top right. The ball takes a twang off the hapless Svamas and diverts towards the top left, leaving the keeper no chance. On his own penalty spot, Svamas of AEK takes a wild hack at a dropping ball, connecting only with fresh air. Under\u2019s eyes light up, and he lashes a first-time shot into the top right. Unstoppable and opportunistic. Celtic 0-0 Lille. At Parkhead, the hosts are on their worst run of form since the days before Jock Stein. They\u2019re already out, of course, but could do with a result, mainly to regain some of that misplaced confidence, although a response to Rangers looking highly competent earlier on against Lech Poznan would help. No sign of a valedictory performance yet, with Lille more than holding their own. Leicester 0-0 AEK. Tielemans drags a shot wide left from distance. Not a great deal going on at the King Power, but it\u2019s early days. Spurs 0-0 Antwerp. A corner for the hosts out on the left. Bale flashes a header wide right from eight yards. He should have done better, and holds his head in his hands accordingly. An appropriately slow start to an evening of limited jeopardy. Buta of Antwerp is sent scampering free down the left at New White Hart Lane, but the flag goes up for offside. After a moment of silence in honour of the legendary Paolo Rossi, the games in Glasgow, London and Leicester get underway. Yep, the 8pm kick-offs are indeed ahoy. Yo ho ho. As Barry disappears into the London night, cackling, let\u2019s remind ourselves of the state of play in the groups featuring Leicester City, Celtic and Tottenham Hotspur... Group G: Leicester are through and will top the group with a win, or if they match what Braga do. Braga are through and will top the group if they win and Leicester do not, or if they draw and Leicester lose. Zorya Luhansk and AEK Athens are eliminated. Group H: Lille are through and will top the group with a win, or if Milan do not win. AC Milan are through and will top the group with a win if Lille do not win. Sparta Praha and Celtic are eliminated. Group J: Antwerp are through and will top the group if they win or draw and Tottenham are through and will top the group if they win. LASK and Ludogorets are eliminated. Our 8pm kick-offs are very much ahoy! Scott Murray will be keeping tabs on them for you. Enjoy. Arsenal made it six wins from six in the group stages on a night in Dublin that several academy graduates got a chance to impress against game Dundalk. Cedric Itton and Ianis Hagi got the goals that secured victory for Rangers and guarantees they\u2019ll go through to the knockout stages as group winners. Dundalk 2-4 Arsenal: From a free-kick arced into the Dundalk penalty area, Calum Chambers manages to scramble the ball into the net, but is flagged for offside. It would have been a nice way to mark his return from injury after the best part of a year, but he\u2019ll be pleased just to have got 90 minutes of first team action under his belt without major incident. Sean Hoare pulls a goal back for Dundalk, rising to flick a whipped free-kick from the right in at the near post with his head. Or possibly his shoulder. Dundalk 1-4 Arsenal: Aged 18, Miguel Azeez, an Arsenal player since the age of five, comes on for his senior debut. He replaces Joe Willock. Nicolas Pepe plays Balogun in on goal with a perfectly weighted pass into his path. The substitute sends a curling shot around Rogers with a fine finish. Lech Poznan 0-2 Rangers: Full of confidence after his Puskas Goal of the Year contender, Hagi cuts inside from the left, gets the ball on to his right foot and unleashes a rasping shot that brings a good save out of Filip Bednarek. Rangers win a free-kick about 40 yards from the Lech Poznan goal. The ball\u2019s floated into the penalty area, where Connor Goldson rise to send a header arcing over Poznan goalkeeper Bednarek. It hits the underside of the cross-bar, bounces downwards on to the line and back up again. Ianis Hagi is on hand to head it home from all of one centimetre out. Goldson is taking the credit, but it\u2019s Hagi\u2019s goal. In the Dundalk penalty area just outside the six-yard box, Balogan chests down the ball with his back to goal and plays it short to Willock. He takes it away from a defender with a neat first touch before smashing it past Gary Rogers. Dundalk 1-2 Arsenal: Arsenal win a free-kick just outside the \u201cDundalk penalty area, well left. Cedric stings the palms of Dundalk goalkeeper Gary Rogers, who is forced to save the follow-up with substitute Folarin Balogan \u2013 on for Eddie Nketiah \u2013 lurking. Nketiah was not best pleased at being taken off by his manager Mikel Arteta. Lech Poznan 0-1 Rangers: Standard Liege have retaken the lead against Benfica. As things stand, Rangers will be sauntering into the knockout stages as group winners. Lech Poznan 0-1 Rangers: Rangers central defender Leon Balogan gets booked for a shove in the back on Mikael Ishak. Lech Poznan 0-1 Rangers: Rangers have a free-kick just outside their own penalty area to defend. Tymoteusz Puchacz hits the target but it\u2019s a relatively straightforward save for Jon McLaughlin. Dundalk 1-2 Arsenal: David McMillan pulled his hamstring in that counter-attack and is forced off to be replaced by Daniel Kelly. Sean Gannon also makes way for John Mountney. Dundalk 1-2 Arsenal: Michael Duffy attacks on the counter for Dundalk, gadding down the inside left at top speed. He cuts inside and squares the ball for David McMillan who is up in support, but his pass goes just behind the striker. Dundalk 1-2 Arsenal: Dundalk play the ball out of defence but lose it on the edge of the final third. Arsenal get it upfield and Emile Smith Rowe tries to get in behind Sean Gannon, only to be relieved of possession. Celtic: Hazard, Duffy, Jullien, Ajer, Frimpong, McGregor, Soro, Turnbull, Laxalt, Elyounoussi, Klimala. Subs: Barkas, Taylor, Brown, Griffiths, Ajeti, Rogic, Edouard, Bain, Henderson, Harper, Welsh. Lille: Maignan, Niasse, Fonte, Djalo, Bradaric, Ikone, Soumare, Xeka, Weah, David, Yazici. Subs: Karnezis, Botman, Bamba, Yilmaz, Sanches, Lihadji, Andre, Mandava, Chevalier, Innocenti. Leicester City: Ward, Justin, Fofana, Evans, Thomas, Praet, Ndidi, Tielemans, Under, Barnes, Iheanacho. Subs: Schmeichel, Morgan, Vardy, Albrighton, Perez, Choudhury, Mendy, Fuchs, Jakupovic. AEK Athens: Tsintotas, Hnid, Svarnas, Nedelcearu, Vasilantonopoulos, Mandalos, Andre Simoes, Krsticic, Mitaj, Garcia, Ansarifard. Subs: Albanis, Laci, Tankovic, Oliveira, Galanopoulos, Shakhov, Athanasiadis, Sabanadzovic, Ioannis Sardelis, Christopoulos, Macheras, Theocharis. Tottenham Hotspur: Hart, Tanganga, Sanchez, Davies, Doherty, Winks, Lo Celso, Reguilon, Bale, Vinicius, Lucas Moura. Subs: Alderweireld, Son, Kane, Dier, Sissoko, Alli, Bergwijn, Ndombele, Whiteman, Clarke, White, Scarlett. Antwerp: Beiranvand, Buta, Seck, Gelin, Batubinsika, Lukaku, Benson, Haroun, Hongla, Refaelov, Benavente. Subs: Chevaughn, De Laet, Birger Verstraete, Juklerod, Boya, Miyoshi, Opoku Ampomah, Butez, Mbokani. Play resumes: They\u2019ve kicked off for the second half in Dublin and seconds later, Rangers and Lech Poznan follow suit in Poland. Group A: CSKA Sofia 2-1 Roma, Young Boys 0-0 CFR Cluj Group B: Dundalk 1-2 Arsenal, Rapid Vienna 1-1 Molde Group C: B Leverkusen 2-0 Slavia Prague, Hapoel Beer Sheeva 0-0 Nice Group D: Lech Poznan 0-1 Rangers, Standard Liege 1-1 Benfica Group E: PAOK 0-0 Granada, PSV Eindhoven 1-0 Omonia Nicosia Group F: Rijeka 0-0 AZ ALkmaar, Napoli 1-0 Real Sociedad Lech Poznan 0-1 Rangers: Cedric Itten\u2019s third goal of the season for Rangers separates the sides in Poland at the break. Dundalk 1-2 Arsenal: Callum Chambers gets in a crucial block to deflect a Darragh Leahy shot over the bar when a goal looked certain. Nothing comes from the corner and it\u2019s half-time in Dublin. Lech Poznan 0-1 Rangers: A good chance goes begging for Rangers, when Ianis Hagi gets the ball stuck under his feet after being put in behind the Pozan defence. He manages to get a shot away eventually, but doesn\u2019t trouble Poznan goalkeeper Filip Bednarek. Dundalk 1-2 Arsenal: Fairly comfortable evenings so far for both Arsenal and Rangers, with the former winning a corner in Dublin. Nicolas Pepe sends the ball deep and Mustafi heads it back across the penalty area. Dundalk clear. Swiss striker Cedric Itten roofs the ball at the near post, having danced past a defender who was expecting him to cut inside. Rangers are ahead! Dundalk 1-2 Arsenal: Arsenal\u2019s Joe Willock gets himself a booking for catching Dundalk\u2019s |David McMillan with a trailing hand as he dribbled past him. It was a total accident and seemed a little over-zealous on the part of the referee. Top Irish football newshound Daniel McDonnell tweets: Elsewhere in Group B: Rapid Vienna trail Norwegian side Molde, in a game they need to win if they are to entertain any hopes of going through to the knockout stages. C\u2019mon the Town! Jordan Flores cuts inside from the right, plays a give-and-go with Michael Duffy on thre edge of the penalty area, picks up the inch-perfect return pass and and spanks a rising diagonal shot past Runar Runarsson in the Arsenal goal. Dundalk 0-2 Arsenal: Nicolas Pepe looks accusingly at the pitch after sending a shot high over the ball. Given the state of the playting surface, we\u2019ll give him the benefit of the doubt and say the ball took a bobble just before he hit it. Have that! Mohamed Elneny smashes one into the top right-hand corner from about 35 yards out, his shot arrowing past the outstretched fingers of Gary Rogers and scorshing into the stanchion. That\u2019s Elneny\u2019s first goal in three years and only his third for Arsenal, but it was an absolute screamer. Lech Poznan 0-0 Rangers: Lech Poznan miss a sitter, Lubomir Satka rising unmarked to meet a perfect cross from the right, only to head the ball over the cross-bar. Lech Poznan 0-0 Rangers: It remains scoreless in Poland, but in Group D\u2019s other game, Standard Liege have gone ahead against Benfica. That\u2019s good news for Rangers, who only have to match the Portuguese side\u2019s result to top the group. Nketiah is put in behind the Dundalk defence and lifts the ball over the onrushing goalkeeper Rogers with a neat little flick. That makes him Arsenal\u2019s top goalscorer this season, despite his limited opportunities. Dundalk 0-0 Arsenal: Eddie Nketiah wins a free-kick for Arsenal just to the left of the Dundalk penalty area. Andrew Boyle was the offender, his tug on the Aersenal man\u2019s shirt earning him a yellow card. Cedric whips the ball towards the near post, where Darragh Leahy puts it out for a throw-in down by the corner. Elsewhere in the Europa League: In Group A, CSKA Sofia have taken an early lead against Italian side Roma, with Thiago Rodrigues getting on the scoresheet. Lech Poznan 0-0 Rangers: Pedro Tiba brings a smart save out of Jon McLaughlin in the Rangers goal with a shot from distance. Dundalk 0-0 Arsenal: Ashley Maitland Niles tries to knock the ball across the face of goal for Eddie Nketiah, having got on the end of a cross from the right. Dundalk goalkeeper Gary Rogers does enough to ensure the ball doesn\u2019t bounce kindly for the striker and the Irish side clear their lines. Calum Chambers: The right back makes his first start for Arsenal in 348 days, having spent lockdown doing physiotherapy remotely as he recovered from a cruciate injury. Dundalk kick off in Dublin. The pitch in the Aviva is like a cabbage field, having hosted a rugby match recently. Play is also underway in Poznan, where the pitch looks in far better nick, western Poland not being a rugby stronghold. A minute\u2019s silence: All Europa League games tonight will be preceded by a minute\u2019s silence for the late, great Paolo Rossi, who has died. Rest in peace, Paolo. Not long now: Kick-off in Dublin and Poznan is just a few moments away and the teams are out on their respective pitches. Dundalk: This is the Irish team\u2019s final game of the season and 14 of their players will be out of contract at the final whistle and have no idea whether or not they\u2019ll be offered new ones for next season. Such is the parlous state of the finances of clubs in the League of Ireland. In another far from ideal situation, their manager Flippo Giovagnoli has not been allowed to sit in the dug-out during their Europa League matches, because he doesn\u2019t have a Uefa Pro licence. It is a state of affairs, he says, which has made his job \u201cimpossible\u201d. Lech Poznan: Bednarek, Butko, Satka, Crnomarkovic, Puchacz, Skoras, Pedro Tiba, Muhar, Kaminski, Marchwinski, Ishsk Subs: Bakowski, Malenica, Kravets, Sykora, Ramirez, Dejewski, Moder, Awwad, Niewadomski, Czerwiski, Sobol, Borowski Rangers: McLaughlin, Patterson, Balogun, Goldson, Barisic, Zungu, Kamara, Aribo, Arfield, Hagi, Itten Subs: McGregor, Kinnear, Tavernier, Bassey, Kent, Morelos, Barker, Stewart, Barjonas, Dickson Rangers boss Steven Gerrard rests James Tavernier, with Nathan Patterson stepping up in his place for only the second start of his senior career. Iannis Hagi is welcomed back into the Rangers side, while Bongani Zungu makes his first Europa League start. Kemar Roofe is a conspicuous absentee from the matchday squad. Dundalk: Rogers, Hoare, Boyle, Cleary, Gannon, Shields, Flores, Leahy, McEleney, Duffy, McMillan. Subs: Corcoran, Wynne, Gartland, Mountney, Sloggett, McCarey, Colovic, Dummigan, Kelly. Arsenal: Runarsson, Chambers, Pablo Mari, Mustafi, Soares, Smith-Rowe, Maitland-Niles, Elneny, Willock, Nketiah, Pepe. Subs: Cottrell, Azeez, Saka, Ceballos, Holding, Macey, Balogun, Hein. Mikel Arteta has made a clean sweep of 11 changes for tonight\u2019s game, electing to give his fringe players a run out with qualification already secured. Thomas Partey, who limped off with a thigh injury during last weekend\u2019s defeat at the hands of Tottenham will miss \u201cthe next few matches\u201d according to his manager. Dundalk, who beat Shamrock Rovers to win the Irish cup final last Sunday, have a fully fit but possibly hungover squad to choose from. Teams from the UK and Ireland Group B: Arsenal are through as group winners. Molde will go through if they avoid defeat, or if they score in a one-goal loss. Rapid will go through if they win either 1-0 or by a margin of two goals of more. Dundalk are eliminated.

Lech Poznan and Stnadard Liege are eliminated. Group G: Leicester are through and will top the group with a win, or if they match what Braga do.
