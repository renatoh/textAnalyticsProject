As territories and states including Queensland close their borders, Aboriginal health services said they must now secure the safety of vulnerable communities in regional areas, who are close to centres of infection. They are asking the national cabinet to urgently approve plans for safe places where Aboriginal people can self-isolate or quarantine, including repurposing vacant hotels, motels, offices and rental properties. \u201cPeople are saying anything would do, even if we got some good quality tents,\u201d Dr Jason Agostino, a GP and epidemiologist who works with the north Queensland community of Yarrabah, said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming into dry season, and while that\u2019s definitely not optimal, at the moment communities don\u2019t have funded options.\u201d Agostino said a tent could be safer than sharing an overcrowded house. \u201cIt seems to have been forgotten or missed that the large majority of cases in China spread within families and within households,\u201d he said. Yarrabah, about 50km from Cairns, has about 3,500 people but only 350 houses. Around 580 people are over the age of 50, and 80% of them have some form of chronic disease. There are 82 people over the ago of 70. \u201cSo while we are considered remote, we are only 50km from Cairns, a large population centre with a lot of tourists, as well as local people who\u2019ve traveled overseas and returned.\u201d There are currently two Covid-19 cases being managed in Cairns. Agostino is medical advisor to the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (Naccho), which has been pushing for governments to make isolation space available and pitch in to help build temporary accommodation. At Yarrabah, he said, about 70% of the health workforce lives in overcrowded houses, and keeping them healthy in coming months is vital. Dr Jason King is senior medical officer at the Yarrabah clinic, Gurriny Yealamucka. In 2018, King said an outbreak of mumps raced through the community and within weeks was estimated to have infected over 150 people. Half of those surveyed afterwards had been sharing a bedroom with two or more people. \u201cThe advice we were giving people then is precisely what we\u2019re giving people now: socially isolate to help prevent the spread,\u201d Dr King said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re talking to someone who lives in a house with ten other people, they\u2019ve got three bedrooms, one bathroom where maybe the plumbing and the tapware is not particularly functioning, their ability to self-isolate is incredibly impacted. King echoed concerns raised by Northern Territory Aboriginal health groups last week, about long delays in testing for Covid-19. \u201cYou have this incredibly fertile breeding ground for the rapid spread of infectious diseases in a community like this. And even when people want to be able to follow the advice to self-isolate, they just don\u2019t physically have the ability to do that. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking because you don\u2019t want to be the one that brings it home to your family, and that\u2019s the thing we\u2019re faced with.\u201d Crowding in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities occurs at around three times the rate of the non-Indigenous population, with over 115,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander households living in overcrowded homes nationwide."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
