Chief executive Brian Davis conceded that many commentators think the strategy \"naive\" but added: \"Ours is a long-term strategy. I don't think we are going to get terribly upset if it struggles for a while.\" Unveiling the society's annual results, Mr Davis reignited the war of words between Nationwide and the Halifax when he denounced as \"absolutely awful\" its rival's decision not to transfer bor rowers automatically to the lower rate it announced three months ago. Halifax's borrowers have to ask to be moved. He also called on the government to introduce legislation that would require all mortgages to meet the so-called CAT standards, a range of voluntary minimum standards covering charges and terms for home loans. Mr Davis made this point personally to chancellor Gordon Brown during his visit to Nationwide's Swindon headquarters last week. The results show Nationwide lent \u00a33.7bn in mortgages in the year, down from \u00a34.7bn in 1999-2000. This pushed its share of the new home loans market down to 9.1% from 12%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
