Some of the children come from very damaged backgrounds which means their behaviour can be quite off the wall and difficult to deal with. I'm still enjoying the fact that it's very varied, especially the ongoing support for children already in care and supporting families. We are under constant pressure from the government ratings scheme, a percentage of which comes from how many initial and core assessments of children we complete within the given time scale. The Laming recommendations [from the Victoria Climbi\u00bf inquiry] are just beginning to filter through now to senior management level, and we're waiting to see how they will implement them. I wouldn't say I was worried about it. The media always portray social workers as either intervening too quickly or sitting back and doing nothing, but I think all of us thought that all agencies must have missed opportunities in that case. I still enjoy the work personally but financially, for the amount of work I do, dealing with potentially dangerous situations and assessing risk, the renumeration isn't great. My pay scale increments have slowed down now, and I do notice that my two brothers in the private sector are doing much better financially. I went on strike for four days this year in support of a Unison pay campaign. We all lost pay, and you worry about the families that you need to be around for. It's always difficult to leave your caseload, but I did it out of a sense of solidarity because I think it's appalling that people are working for local government and earning under \u00a35 an hour. Public voices: March 21 2002 Social worker, Leeds Salary: \u00a319,200 I'm still working as a field worker with children and families, a post I've been in for two and a half years now. In terms of workload, it's been more of the same this year. We have started a new procedure doing initial assesments. Now, when a case is referred to us, we assess what action needs to be taken, if any, within seven working days. On average we do three a week, as well as core assessments, which are more detailed and must be completed within seven working weeks. One thing looming is our inspection by the social services inspectorate at the end of the year. We're aware that the number of assessments processed in the right time will be one of of their criteria. I'm still interested in people and helping them to improve their lives by linking their own resources with those available around them. Yes, the job is difficult and challenging at times. The money is an important part of why you get out of bed in the morning, but you need a lot more than that to motivate yourself. You need more than money to sustain you. We're always hearing that resources are tight, especially now at the end of the financial year, but it's the same pressure that you always feel when you're taking resources from a limited pot. I still enjoy the work, though there are times when it is more pressurised. At the end of the day, it still motivates me. The Common Good: March 21 2001 Michael Clarke (previously Maguire), Social worker, Leeds Salary: \u00a317,000 I've been a field worker with children and families for 18 months. I used to be a housing support worker for a local charity, but my chances of career advance ment were limited, so I retrained as a social worker. There's a lot to get through in the week. You have to record every phone call, every family visit. I write a lot of reports for court proceedings. I also look after a number of kids with care orders, who have to be reviewed regularly. But most of my work is good old-fashioned family support. The families I deal with are struggling for a variety of reasons, be it bereavement, loss of a partner, poverty, or drug abuse. A lot of what we do is about helping people to use the resources they already have. People assume that social work is about taking kids away from parents, but a lot of it is about keeping families together. The hardest aspect is the pressure on resources. For example, I have two adolescents who are getting beyond the control of their parents, but no residential care places, so I have to keep shoring things up at home when really the whole family could do with a break. Personally, I feel very valued, because I get a lot of support from my team manager. But social workers do have a negative image, especially in the press. We're damned if we do and damned if we don't. In theory we work 8.30am-5pm, though in practice it can be later. I can claim the hours back afterwards. I earn \u00a317,000 pa. Given the demands of the job and level of responsibility the pay could be better. When you look at the pay enhancements given to other public service employees, social workers have been left behind. At the end of the day we're paid to do a job, but if you were only doing it for the money, that couldn't sustain you. You need a genuine desire to help and support people in difficult situations. I get a lot of personal satisfaction out of the job."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
