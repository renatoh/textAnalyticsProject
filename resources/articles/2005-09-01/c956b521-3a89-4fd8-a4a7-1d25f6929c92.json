At least 12 people were admitted to hospitals while dozens suffered minor injuries, according to air force spokesman Ajantha de Silva. The plane was taxiing when the pilot received a call from the control tower about a bomb threat, Mr de Silva said. When the plane's emergency doors opened panic-stricken passengers poured out. The flight was bound for Riyadh and Jeddah. In 2001, Tamil Tiger rebels destroyed aircraft at the airport in an attack that left 22 people dead. Yesterday the guerrillas rejected a suggestion to hold talks to review a ceasefire at the airport, saying the venue was not appropriate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
