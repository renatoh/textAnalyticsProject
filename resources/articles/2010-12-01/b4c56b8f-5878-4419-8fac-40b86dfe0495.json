It was time to get professional, so they invested the \u00a31,000 they had made from a year of gigging in their own van, bought from a mobile dog-grooming business. \"We were so proud of that van,\" guitarist Sam Halliday says. \"It was so exciting at the time.\" \"It was a pile of shit,\" bassist Kevin Baird replies. \"We were on the dual carriageway, and one of the wheels came off,\" he sighs, shaking his head. \"It flew straight into the oncoming traffic.\" At the time, you wouldn't have put money on the County Down trio making it to the next town, but Two Door have become one of the unlikely success stories of 2010. Twelve months ago, they were supporting Delphic in 300-capacity venues. This year, they have played two sellout UK tours and filled the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London. Their gigs \u2013 with the fans chanting \"Two Door! Two Door!\" and singing along with every word \u2013 are some of the most euphoric on the circuit. Along the way, they have shifted 60,000 copies of their shimmering electropop debut, Tourist History. The oddest aspect of Two Door's rise is that it has taken place virtually under the radar. While crowds have flocked, there's been very little of the media exposure that usually accompanies an emerging group. Until recently, the radio virtually ignored their singles; they'd toured the UK four times before they received any press coverage at all. \"We certainly haven't been shoved into anyone's faces,\" Baird says with considerable understatement. \"But people have been able to discover us for themselves.\" They have had some assistance. Last December, their name appeared towards the bottom of the BBC's influential Sound of 2010 poll, the first time many had heard of them at all. Then Kanye West mentioned them on his blog \u2013 which led the excited young band to phone their mums. Songs have featured as backing music on Sky Sports, and in PlayStation and Xbox games. But mostly, their success has been built on years of struggle and self-belief, playing anywhere they could. \"There's a lot of self-motivation in our music,\" says red-haired frontman Alex Trimble, a formerly shy 21-year-old now coming to terms with his role as a rock frontman. He's referring to songs like Something Good Can Work, with its infectious mantra: \"You've got to step up your game to make it to the top.\" \"Because Northern Ireland is cut off from the rest of the UK and the country, it always felt harder for us than any other band,\" he says. \"But we told ourselves not to listen to kids at school and everyone else who said: 'You're from a small town in Ireland, you'll never make it.' There wasn't any other option. It was all or nothing for us.\" At one point, the band even risked their futures \u2013 giving up university places so that they could work harder on the band, a leap of faith that alarmed their parents. \"I sold the idea to mine on the basis that it was a gap year,\" Trimble says. \"We're in the third year of it now.\" \"But we always planned to keep going until it worked out,\" adds Baird \u2013 also 21, but the worldliest of the trio \u2013 who recalls their early touring diet of tortilla chips and water from the venues, and tells how they slept on fans' floors. And if things hadn't gone to plan? \"At least we'd have known we'd have given it a go. We didn't want to spend the rest of our lives wondering 'What if \u2026?'\" Two Door grew up in Bangor, a small seaside town they compare to a run-down Blackpool. They started playing guitars in the music department of Bangor grammar school, and when everyone else went to the cinema at weekends, they stayed at home writing songs. \"I knew four girls,\" shrugs Trimble. \"We thought: 'We'll make songs. Then the girls will come.'\" Their first band was an emo outfit who made what Baird calls \"bad music.\" \"It was emotional!\" corrects Trimble. \"'I'm a teenager and I'm unhappy about it.'\" When girls didn't arrive \u2013 and the drummer left \u2013 they decided on a rethink, adapting the name of the local Tudor cinema club and replacing the drummer with a laptop. However, their first gig with the new, more electronic sound \u2013 at a Christian festival in a huge warehouse, in front of a dozen people \u2013 was a shambles. \"We were used to plugging into my stepdad's hi-fi,\" sighs Trimble, \"but when we got there they had this massive sound system. We said: 'Er, can we plug into it?' We didn't have a clue.\" Then people started shouting 'Give us a drum solo!' at the laptop,\" Baird says. Barid suspects many bands would have packed it in there and then, but this band are clearly not easily fazed, which may stem from their upbringing in post-Troubles Bangor. Although the worst of the violence was long past by the time they were conscious of the world, they grew up thinking that an army presence, sectarian murals and bomb scares were normal. \"It's only when other people visit that you realise you were surrounded by things that people are quite shocked by,\" Baird says, matter-of-factly. \"You'd just think, 'Oh, another bomb scare, I'll take another route.'\" That was the mindset they took into music. As Trimble says: \"Doing loads of terrible gigs made us realise we had to be better, tighter. We'd practise every day until we got it right.\" They also sweated over writing better songs, learning how to use the computer properly and editing hour-long jams into catchy, four- minute anthems. As Baird tells it, the problem with a lot of Northern Irish bands is that they can get very well-known in Belfast, but then don't know where else to go. \"We always wanted to break out of that Northern Irish cycle,\" he says. They first used MySpace to get gigs in the UK and then bombarded management contacts they had on Wikipedia until they secured a manager and then a label. Signing to hip French indie Kitsun\u00e9 may not have been an obvious move, but was typical of Two Door's logic. \"Because we felt cut off from the UK, it made as much sense to sign with a label based in France,\" Baird says. Usefully, the label was able to launch them around Europe. Two Door do sometimes wonder if being from an unfashionable town in Ireland made the media reluctant to cover them, but since Tourist History was released in March, their gigs \u2013 now including a human drummer \u2013 have created a groundswell it has become impossible to ignore. The tipping point came at this summer's Reading festival, where the audience started the \"Two Door!\" chant before they'd even come on. \"After the second song, I had to stop everything because I couldn't hear myself think,\" Trimble says, grinning at the memory. \"I've not watched the video because I know how stupid I must have looked. But that was the first moment I realised things were happening. It was the most amazing moment of my life.\" Within two frenetic weeks, they'd landed an NME feature, got on the Radio 1 playlist and embarked on their biggest ever tour. The songs that have struck a particular chord with audiences express a quality that is otherwise dying out: the sheer, emotional excitement of being in a pop group. The band still make a special effort to talk to fans, just like they did when they played in Manchester to four people. Being around them, it's hard not to be touched by their excitement at traveling to different countries and getting free food and drink. They're even happy chatting to me for an hour and a half \u2013 far longer than you'd expect of a band who've been on the road for 14 months, with Amsterdam waiting to be explored. The royalties may be trickling in \u2013 and until then, they're still earning less than their own road crew \u2013 but they are living their own dream. \"We've been so busy that it's only when you start to talk about it that you take it all in,\" Trimble says, gazing around yet another dressing room. \"I never expected anything from our first record. I just wanted people to hear it. When I think about everything that's happened to us this year, it's overwhelming. But it does feel like we've earned it, and that feels really nice.\" Two Door Cinema Club's next single, What You Know, is released on Kitsun\u00e9 on 10 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
