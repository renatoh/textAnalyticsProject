Ascot is the closest racecourse to Woolfords Farm, near Guildford, Surrey, where infected cattle were slaughtered this weekend, but clerk of the course Chris Stickels remains positive that his racing programme will not be interrupted. \"At the moment, there's no problem,\" he said. \"We can race, and it's just a case of keeping an eye on the situation, waiting to see if further outbreaks occur.\" The government's ban on livestock movement does not extend to horses and racing's rulers are optimistic that the outbreak will remain localised and not affect the sport. On Saturday, the British Horseracing Authority instructed licensed trainers within 10km of infected premises not to send horses to the races \"until a decision has been taken on any necessary bio-security measures\" but the only trainer currently affected is the little-known Pru Townsley, who has had just 20 runners this year. The BHA will meet this morning with representatives of trainers and racecourses to discuss what measures would be necessary in the event of further outbreaks. During the foot and mouth epidemic of 2001, the Cheltenham Festival was among 121 fixtures lost as racecourses near affected areas were closed and all racing was briefly suspended. Ascot is 34km from Woolfords Farm but a further positive test within 10km of the Queen's racecourse would almost certainly lead to the abandonment of Saturday's meeting. Stickels denied having any real fear of such an outcome. \"Defra have taken some very positive steps to contain the outbreak, so we'll just have to monitor what happens,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
