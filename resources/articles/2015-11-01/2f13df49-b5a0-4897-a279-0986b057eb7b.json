It means he has to be a massive contributor the team. If he can do that, then he can negotiate from power. If he has kept us up \u2013 then we will probably want to keep him.\u201d Allardyce clearly feels certain senior professionals at the Stadium of Light have much to prove and he has warned them they would struggle to replicate their current wages elsewhere. Despite their position in the relegation zone Sunderland\u2019s squad is the eighth-best remunerated in the Premier League and the new manager has issued a reminder that life remains much less comfortable elsewhere. \u201cIf your contract is running out then where do you go?\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s outside the Premier League, then you will be talking about earning a small percentage of what you are earning now. \u201cYou might not get the contract you think you are worth so keeping a team in the Premier League and staying a Premier League player for as long as possible should be every player\u2019s goal. That\u2019s where it is, that\u2019s where it all happens. Both from an enjoyment side but also in terms of what it brings you and your family financially. Your contract running out can create panic in your professional and family life.\u201d The only exception to the ban on new and extended deals is negotiations involving young players such as Sunderland\u2019s much-admired England Under-21 winger Duncan Watmore, whose agreement expires in the summer. \u201cIf it\u2019s Duncan Watmore or any other young player then yes, it\u2019s something we may consider now,\u201d said Allardyce. \u201cBut all the senior players no, it would be put on hold. \u201cThere are players here with talent and ability but they have to understand that it\u2019s the hard graft, discipline and desire that gets you there, not the ability. If you\u2019re not prepared to roll your sleeves up, dig in and graft, if you\u2019re not prepared to play the game with intelligence, then ability doesn\u2019t shine through and you can\u2019t use what you\u2019ve been blessed with. At the moment though it\u2019s far too early for me to make a real judgment on the squad, it\u2019s a bit too early to say whether they\u2019re going to be reliable or not.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
