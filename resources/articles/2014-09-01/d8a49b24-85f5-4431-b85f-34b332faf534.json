Berlioz wrote it for Paganini, violin and viola virtuoso, though he never played it. This disc links with another Romantic star performer, Liszt, a Berlioz devotee who transcribed Harold for viola and piano. If this is something of a connoisseur\u2019s recital \u2013 whether for fans of the viola, Berlioz, Liszt or all three \u2013 its hybrid pleasures set it apart and there\u2019s never the danger, as in the original orchestral version, that the viola gets submerged. Here, as played by Jennifer Stumm on her Maggini contralto viola c1600, with Elizabeth Pridgen the a sensitive accompanist (and soloist in Liszt interludes), the instrument truly shines."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
