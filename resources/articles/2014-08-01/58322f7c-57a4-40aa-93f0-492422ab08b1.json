We recognise Africa for its greatest resource which is its people and its talents and its potential,\u201d he told the largest gathering of African leaders ever held in Washington. \u201cWe don\u2019t simply want to extract minerals from the ground for our growth. We want to build partnerships that create jobs and opportunity for all our peoples, that unleash the next era of African growth,\u201d Although the president did not mention China by name, the comments were clearly aimed at Beijing as his administration uses the summit to promote the US as a better partner in its efforts to catch up with the rapidly expanding Sino-Africa trade. Obama announced $33bn in new commitments to invest in Africa, mostly from private companies such as Coca-Cola and General Electric. But he noted that US trade with all of the continent is still about the same as with Brazil alone. And while the president took a jab at China, two of the US\u2019s three largest trade partners in Africa are Angola and Nigeria because of oil. US officials used the second day of the summit, which was focused on trade, to state repeatedly that they foresee a bright future for Africa and that the US is key to unlocking it. Obama\u2019s vice-president, Joe Biden, called it the \u201ccontinent of limitless promise\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s never been a good bet to bet against America, and America is betting on Africa,\u201d he said. The secretary of state, John Kerry, spoke of the summit as potentially world changing. \u201cIf everybody gets this right, this meeting and this moment and the days ahead of us can literally become a pivotal defining moment for our future history and for the world,\u201d he said. African leaders were more cautious in their assessment of the summit and the difference that foreign businesses can make. Tanzania\u2019s president, Jakaya Kikwete, said that in previous visits to drum up trade in the US he did not think his efforts were taken very seriously but that he believed things to be different this time. President Jacob Zuma of South Africa praised some US economic initiatives but said they needed to be extended. But none were talking about the meeting as groundbreaking. Tunisia\u2019s president, Moncef Marzouki, said economic development alone could not provide stability without social justice and political rights. He said foreign businesses have a responsibility to do more than seek profit and should choose to invest in democratic states that are working to combat corruption, educate their populations and create equality. \u201cBy sending this message everywhere that good governance is for the business community is something that is very important and is as important as making money,\u201d he said. \u201cI must stress we don\u2019t need development which is not useful for the population. We don\u2019t want to widen the gap between rich and poor because this will lead to more instability and more pressure and more civil war.\u201d Kerry did not disagree. \u201cBusiness is not just business for the sake of business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is for providing the foundation for people to be able to live their lives with that opportunity, dignity, and respect. \u201cI don\u2019t have to remind anybody here that Nelson Mandela, one of the greatest leaders the world has seen in all time, did not spend 27 years in jail so that he could get out and run a business, with no disrespect to anybody here. He did it so that people of his country would have an opportunity to live up to an ideal. He did it for rights \u2013 human rights \u2013 that are the foundation of any civilised society.\u201d Obama picked up on the theme later in the day, saying that without the rule of law, investment will falter. \u201cPeople should be able to start a business and ship their goods without having to pay a bribe or hire somebody\u2019s cousin,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have to talk about security and peace because the future belongs to those who build not those who destroy.\u201d But while there was a public acknowledgement from some African leaders that they still faced issues of corruption, mismanagement and, in some countries, conflict, others were clearly concerned that too strong an emphasis on problems played into stereotypes about the continent that discouraged foreign investment. Senegal\u2019s president, Macky Sall, said perceptions of Africa are rapidly changing but it is too often still seen in a negative light. The broadcaster Charlie Rose moderated a discussion at the summit with five African presidents which highlighted the problem. After a question about the summit, Rose swiftly moved to Ebola, directing a question at Kikwete, who pointed out that his country is on the other side of the continent from the outbreak. Sall interjected to say that Ebola should be seen as a devastating virus and a global issue, not an African disease."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
