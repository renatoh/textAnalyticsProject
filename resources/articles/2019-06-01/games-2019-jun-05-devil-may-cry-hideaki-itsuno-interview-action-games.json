It sold decently, in the end, but was widely regarded as a critical flop. \u201cWhen it finished up, they all realised they could have done better,\u201d explains Devil May Cry producer Matt Walker (and Itsuno\u2019s translator for this interview). \u201cSo he and others at Capcom said, we\u2019re going to take all of our collective knowledge on how to make a good fighting game, a good action game, and put everything we can into making Devil May Cry 3. \u201cAnd if this isn\u2019t received well, if this doesn\u2019t sell well, that\u2019s it. We\u2019ll just have to quit Capcom, and do something else.\u201d For the person helming one of the most outrageously hyperactive action game series out there, Itsuno is rather reserved in person. But his passion for action games is intense. Devil May Cry 3 was a massive success, and this year\u2019s Devil May Cry 5 has been celebrated as a return to form for the whole genre. \u201cWe didn\u2019t look at other action games for DMC5,\u201d Itsuno explains, \u201cthough one thing we did do was look at Monster Hunter World, which was a massive effort for Capcom \u2013 it made a lot of improvements to make it easier for people to get into.\u201d Instead, he says, they focused on what was great about Devil May Cry in the first place. \u201cWhat makes action games fun hasn\u2019t changed in 30 years,\u201d explains Itsuno. \u201cYou come up against a challenge, and maybe you don\u2019t beat it the first time, but you know what you did wrong. You know what you\u2019re going to do next time. And you better yourself, you overcome that challenge on your own terms, and by doing that you feel this immense sense of accomplishment. \u201cAnd I wanted to do that again. I wanted to show the world \u2013 hey, don\u2019t you think this is what makes action games fun?\u201d Itsuno\u2019s determination to make Devil May Cry 5 was intense, but reports that he threatened to resign over it are overstated, he says. \u201cWhat Itsuno did say, in various internal meetings and so on, is that he wasn\u2019t going to back down,\u201d elaborates Walker. \u201cHe believed in the vision that he had, and he was going to keep pushing for it.\u201d Devil May Cry 5 has become the fastest-selling game in the series to date, loved by both critics and fans \u2013 something far more visible in a world of instantly shareable screenshots, gifs or videos of its amazingly stylish battles. None of that existed when the previous DMC games were released. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like social media was made for Devil May Cry,\u201d says Itsuno. \u201cYou can add so much for players if you give them the ability to share their cool experiences with the game. We try not to limit what people can share.\u201d One thing that really appealed to the team was the graphical quality that modern game technology could deliver: Devil May Cry 5 attracted much praise for its character animation especially. \u201cYou would figure that things had gotten more expensive \u2013 and in terms of the volume of [assets] that we have to make, sure,\u201d says Itsuno. \u201cBut compared to back in the 00s, we have technology that lets us put out even better quality, but cheaper.\u201d He offers the example of the character\u2019s astoundingly realistic-looking costumes. \u201cBack in the day,\u201d he explains, \u201cyou\u2019d have to create the model, create the textures, do it all by hand, which is a lot of money and a lot of work for a lot of people.\u201d Now, instead, they literally create the costumes in real life and scan them into the game \u2013 still expensive, but not to the same extent. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of imagining whether something you design will look realistic or not: the real object is there in the game,\u201d Walker says. \u201cWith facial rigs, too, for performance capture, you end up getting a result that would never have been possible before, for even less work.\u201d Despite technological advances, however, the workload remains infamously heavy for video game developers. \u201cWe\u2019ve always tried to avoid crunch [long hours of overwork] at Capcom, I\u2019ve always set up my projects to avoid it, and it\u2019s never completely worked,\u201d sighs Itsuno, wryly noting that at Capcom they ironically call periods of crunch matsuri, or \u201cfestivals\u201d. \u201cI really want to stress, though, that what we end up spending all of our effort on, why we end up working more on games, is that last 10%,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s that extra effort to make sure it\u2019s going to be a quality game, something that we can be proud of.\u201d \u201cCapcom is a really interesting mix of old and new,\u201d adds Walker, \u201cand a lot of the younger people, they\u2019re not sticking around for the sake of it if they don\u2019t have anything to do. When six o\u2019clock rolls around, there\u2019s really not many people left because they\u2019ve gone home to live their lives.\u201d Itsuno, too, would like to rest; when asked where Devil May Cry is headed next, now that it\u2019s back in favour, he laughs and sighs theatrically. \u201cA vacation, I think,\u201d he says, after a moment\u2019s thought. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard, and we all need a little break.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
