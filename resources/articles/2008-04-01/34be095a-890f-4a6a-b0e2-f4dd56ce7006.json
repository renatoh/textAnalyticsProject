But this gig is predominantly electric, featuring the beats and synthesisers of her past few albums, but only a tiny sneak preview of what is to come. But that is just fine for this Jazz Cafe event, the first of several gigs that celebrate the 50th issue of world music magazine Songlines. A Belgian of Egyptian descent, based in London, Atlas is the world music everywoman par excellence, with a repertoire that embraces the Middle East, the Americas and even folk music from the British isles. She opens with propulsive numbers such as Amulet and Moustahil, her decorative, melismatic vocals floating high and clear above impeccably solid drums (Nick Simms) and deep, five-string bass (Steve Leake). Percussionist Aly El Minyawy adds supplementary vocal lines to songs such as Insal and gets a verse to himself on Ya Weleda, a heavy, trancey piece that gives Atlas ample opportunity to wiggle her hips. Harvey Brough, Atlas's record producer, appears with acoustic guitar to play on Ganwah Bossa Nova, whose beguiling Arabic-Brazil-chillout flavour is enhanced by Eser Ebcin's clever keyboards. Atlas performs Motherless Child unaccompanied before leaving the stage. The spotlight shifts for a long, spectacular solo by El Minyawy, before Atlas returns, now in a spangly green belly-revealing outfit, for the ecstatic dancing and singing on Hayati Inta. But we have to wait until the encore for a taste of her new album, due this summer. Accompanied by Brough on keyboards and violinist Samy Bishai, she sings an exquisitely personal version of Black Is the Colour of My True Love's Hair, before launching into a groove-laden Lamma Bada, another traditional song. \u00b7 At the West End Centre, Aldershot, tonight.
