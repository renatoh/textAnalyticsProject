The cuts to international routes will last for six months after a \u201csudden and significant drop in forward travel demand\u201d, the airline says. Smaller planes will now service a number of key international routes. Globally, the airline industry could lose more than US$100bn (A$150bn) this year because of plunging passenger numbers. Qantas\u2019s signature Sydney-Singapore-London return service (QF1 and QF2) will be temporarily rerouted to become a Sydney-Perth-London service. To help cut costs, Qantas\u2019s chief executive, Alan Joyce \u2013 Australia\u2019s highest paid executive, who took home nearly $24m in 2018 \u2013 will take no salary this financial year. Annual management bonuses have also been scrapped this year, and the chairman and board will take no fees \u2013 or a significant reduction in fees. Non-essential recruitment and consultancy work has been frozen and staff will be asked to take paid or unpaid leave in light of reduced flying activity. Joyce said the past fortnight had seen a sharp drop in bookings on the airline\u2019s international network as the global coronavirus spread continues. \u201cWe expect lower demand to continue for the next several months, so rather than taking a piecemeal approach we\u2019re cutting capacity out to mid-September,\u201d he said. \u201cThis improves our ability to reduce costs as well as giving more certainty to the market, customers and our people. \u201cWe retain the flexibility to cut further or to put capacity back in as this situation develops.\u201d Joyce said reducing flying was the most effective way for Qantas to cut costs and preserve its workforce. \u201cLess flying means less work for our people, but we know coronavirus will pass and we want to avoid job losses wherever possible. We\u2019re asking our people to use their paid leave and, if they can, consider taking some unpaid leave given we\u2019re flying a lot less. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict how long this situation will last, which is why we\u2019re moving now to make sure we remain well-positioned. But we know it will pass, and we\u2019ll be well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities when it does.\u201d Globally, airlines around the world are being forced into similar cost-cutting measures. Carriers have cancelled flights into airports within lockdown regions. United Airlines, JetBlue and Lufthansa have closed routes. British Airways and Air France-KLM are allowing passengers who book flights to change their travel plans without a fee for the next year. The International Air Transport Association has estimated that global revenue losses for passenger airlines in 2020 will be between US$63bn and US$113bn. Moody\u2019s Investors Service has revised its outlook for the global passenger airlines industry to negative from stable. \u201cThe negative outlook reflects the increasing risk to demand for passenger air travel as the coronavirus expands globally,\u201d said Jonathan Root, Moody\u2019s senior vice-president. \u201cThe uncertainty and the speed of the outbreak will pressure airlines\u2019 operating profits and cash generation for at least the first half of 2020. We expect further capacity reductions as the number of infected people and affected countries grow.\u201d Moody\u2019s now estimates an operating margin of less than 5% for 2020 for the aggregate of the airlines it rates, down from its pre-coronavirus expectation of about 9%. Significant unknowns \u2014 uncertainty about the virus\u2019s active period, its eventual geographic spread and the scale of infections in a given country or region \u2014 complicate efforts to project the operational and financial impact. Qantas and Jetstar will contact customers affected by changed flight schedules in the next week. Typically, customers flying internationally will be offered an alternative flight via another capital city or a partner airline, or travel on an alternative day. Disruption to domestic passengers is expected to be minimal given the continued high frequency on most routes. The latest information will be published on Qantas and Jetstar websites."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
