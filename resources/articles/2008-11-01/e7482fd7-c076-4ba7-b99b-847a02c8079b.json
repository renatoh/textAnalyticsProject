By lunchtime on Wall Street, Citigroup shares were down by more than 12% at $7.33 (\u00a34.87), its lowest level since 1995. It was the biggest loser among American banks on another nightmarish trading session on Wall Street. Stocks were down across the board as two key government reports indicated the United States economy was weakening much faster and more deeply than had been thought. Consumer prices dropped at the fastest rate on record in October and new home construction was at a record low, the reports showed. The labour department's consumer price index plummeted 1%, the biggest drop since records began in 1947. Analysts said earlier concern about inflation risks might soon be replaced by worry about deflation, which is even worse for the economic outlook. The bank, which was until recently the largest in the world by market value, is now ranked just fifth in the US behind Minneapolis-based regional lender US Bancorp. Citigroup's market capitalisation plunged to $42.5bn in midday trading, $1bn lower than US Bancorp. Little more than a year ago Citi had a market value of $250bn and dominated the American banking sector. The sharp selloff in Citi shares increases the pressure on Vikram Pandit, the embattled chief executive who has failed to arrest the former giant's rapid decline. Since he took over last December, the company has posted losses of more than $20bn and the banking group has lost more than 73% of its market value. On Monday, Pandit revealed plans to cut a record 52,000 jobs from operations worldwide \u2013 including thousands in the City of London. Far from pleasing the market, as Pandit hoped, the move served only to further depress the share price, which is off more than 18% since the job cuts were announced. To make matters worse, several Wall Street analysts today published bleak profits forecasts for Citigroup. David Trone, the banking analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton, said he expected Citigroup to take net write-downs of $3bn during the fourth quarter. He also widened his quarterly loss estimate for Citigroup to 79 cents a share from eight cents. \"The key question is whether management will be able to continue to find buyers for business units, which is necessary to fortify the capital base against further credit losses and write-downs,\" Trone said. Citigroup today said it would buy the last $17.4bn of assets in the structured investment vehicles it advises. The move will have little impact on the bank's balance sheet, however."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
