The party\u2019s proposed \u201chelp to rent\u201d scheme would allow people aged 18 to 30 to borrow up to \u00a31,500 (\u00a32,000 in London) from the government to use as a deposit on rented accommodation. The loans would be repaid over a period of either 12 or 24 months. The party says many young people are struggling to save deposits to rent without help from family members, forcing them to live with their parents for longer. The average rental deposit in the UK is \u00a31,200, usually six weeks of rent. Leader Nick Clegg, travelling on the Lib Dem campaign bus in south-west England on Thursday, said: You\u2019ve got this generation that is sometimes called \u2018the clipped wing generation\u2019, or \u2018the boomerang generation\u2019, of an increasingly large numbers of youngsters \u2013 I think the estimates are now about 2m people in their 20s and 30s \u2013 who simply can\u2019t find the money needed for a deposit to rent a flat or home of their own. \u201cThey simply can\u2019t find the up front costs to move into rented accommodation, so move back or stay with their own parents. That\u2019s obviously unfair on them, because it means they\u2019re just not getting their feet on the rung of the rented property ladder.\u201d Clegg said the fact that young people were unable to move out of their parents\u2019 homes had a negative effect on the property market. \u201cIt means that couples whose children have grown up are not downsizing as readily as they might because they have to keep large properties to maintain space for their kids. So we have a very simple idea which is in effect to extend a system of government loans,\u201d he said. To be eligible for the proposed loans, tenants would need to be aged 18 to 30, in paid employment and not be home owners or seeking social housing tenancy. Once paid off, the money could used for future rental properties. The interest rate would be pegged to the cost of government borrowing (currently approximately 2.5%). Clegg said the policy would not \u201ccost the government much in terms of year-in, year-out expenditure\u201d and stressed that, as it was a loan, it counted as an asset not a liability, so the loan would not count against the national debt. \u201cFor those parents who want their kids out of their hair, it will give them their own home back and for those parents who want to downsize, it frees them up as well,\u201d said Clegg. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to address the barriers to market entry, the up front costs, much like we are trying to address the up front costs of a deposit on a mortgage.\u201d All of the main political parties have made substantial offers on housing policy during the general election campaign. The Labour party has pledged to introduce three-year tenancy agreements with strict rules to make it more difficult to evict tenants, while the Conservative party have committed to a help-to-buy ISA, announced in the March budget. The Lib Dems have previously announced proposals to build 300,000 new homes a year and a \u201crent to own\u201d scheme to help first-time buyers get on the property ladder by renting their way to ownership."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
