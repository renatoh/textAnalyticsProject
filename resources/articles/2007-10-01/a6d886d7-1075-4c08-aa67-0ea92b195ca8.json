I would not trust them further than I could throw them. \"You all did love him once, not without cause,\" Mark Antony would have said of the Liberal Democrats' Sir Menzies Campbell. \"Yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world. Now lies he there ... if you have tears, prepare to shed them now.\" I could never see the point of Liberals, but one thing to be said for them was their catholic taste in leadership, embracing a gay man, an alcoholic, a pensioner and countless Scotsmen. Now they are the parricide party. If they did not kill, \"they did not strive officiously to keep alive\" their poor leader. They are not alone. A new nastiness has crept into British politics since the departure of kindly Mr Blair. It took barely two weeks of \"Brown bounce\" for David Cameron's Conservatives to turn on him in a rage. Two supporters and a party donor, Johan Eliasch, defected in the wake of a sudden dip in his poll rating. Within a week the predictable happened and tables turned. After the Tory conference it was Gordon Brown who tasted the wormwood of political friendship. Colleagues whispered, donors backed off, so-called Blairites went on a friendly-fire rampage. There is now talk of Good Brown being life-expired and Bad Brown being in the ascendant. The Victorian leader, Lord Melbourne, grew fed up with colleagues saying they would support him when he was in the right. \"What I want,\" he cried, \"is men who will support me when I am in the wrong.\" The raw material of Victorian politics was personal loyalty, later superseded by the hierarchical loyalty of a mass political party. With the decline in mass parties there has been a partial return to the concept of the leadership cabal, to the \"court politics\" of the Blair, Brown and Cameron regimes. The resulting detachment from a party base in the country has led to a neurotic dependence on polling evidence as a point of contact with the electorate. Wild gyrations in the fortunes of all three political leaders over the past month have been led by the polls. Brown would never have been so lauded and then damned but for his ratings, nor Cameron so damned and then lauded. Campbell has suffered from a halting Commons performance and from comments on his hardly exceptional age. But all would have been forgiven had his polls not been in decline. If they were sound, ageing would have been eulogised as a concept whose time had come. This is the politics of the hedge fund dealing room. Whatever the topic of conversation, the latest opinion polls form a running stream at the foot of every political screen. They legitimise every move. They are the great authenticator, the god to which there is no answer and against which there is no appeal. Two weeks ago Downing Street pundits were peering into the entrails of the Tory conference. They divined that the Tory poll surge from 10 points behind Labour to level pegging followed immediately on George Osborne's tax-cutting pledge and preceded (and was not attributable to) Cameron's barnstorming speech the following day. It was taxes, not Cameron, that swung public opinion. This nuance persuaded Brown and his chancellor, Alistair Darling, to mimic Osborne's tax-cutting proposals in their pre-budget report. It was a poll-led move that must have seemed clever at the time, but it was so cynical as to prove counterproductive, or so the polls recorded. Hollywood casting sessions involve establishing an actor's \"cue rating\" by inviting members of the public to work a dial on their chair arm while watching audition rushes. The dial measures the instinctive response of the viewer on a scale of pleasure/displeasure. It thus cannot account for the development of character and relies heavily on appearance and the shrieked one-liners familiar in soap operas. Its \"reality\" equivalent is Big Brother. Ming Campbell failed the Big Brother test. Leadership does not do grey any more. To decry the rise of personality in politics is naive. Gladstone, Disraeli and Lloyd George were celebrity politicians long before broadcasting and opinion polls. Democracy is second hand self-government, which means anything that helps acquaint voters with governors is welcome: the more personal publicity, the better. We crave to know not just the policies but the character, integrity, strengths and weaknesses of those in whom we must place our trust. We want to know them as people, and they want to know what we think. Polls do no more, as pollsters carefully emphasise, than measure this knowledge at a moment. They cannot predict election results in the future. Polls are vulnerable to arcane mysteries such as rogues and margins of error, while boasting a seductive objectivity. They can lead politicians down the fatal path to plebiscitary democracy, ruled by the short term and the instantly popular, attacked by philosophers from Burke to Mill as \"the tyranny of prevailing opinion\". Opinion polls, in other words, are best regarded as information, one among many inputs to the political process. They balance others such as leadership vision, parliamentary debate, party opinion, local institutions and media comment. With the exception of the last, all these elements in the democratic mix have weakened in recent years. The media and the polls alone have risen in potency. Politicians are fixated with them, especially now the difference in policy between the parties is a game of pass the parcel. Campbell was a victim of both, brought down by the vicious ageism of cartoonists and the weekly torture chamber of YouGov, ICM and Mori. Brown and Cameron are also vulnerable. They have allowed the buffer institutions of democracy to atrophy. Their party members have been pushed below the salt, and blind - or at least Melbournian - loyalty has gone too. Brown received no vocal support against Cameron last week from his MPs, who nowadays turn up in parliament only to see a boxing match. Cameron has yet to inspire affection from his party in the country, whose cares and customs successive Tory leaders have neglected. Both leaders have come to treat the polls as proxies for the other activities that comprise a participatory democracy. They have allowed their servants to become their masters. I wonder who next will fall to this tyranny of opinion. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
