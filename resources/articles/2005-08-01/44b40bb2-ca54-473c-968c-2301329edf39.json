But here is an email my colleague James Dart received this morning from James Peterson: \"In the nicest gentlemanly-English-cricket playing way, wouldn't it be wise to rest Mike Adamson from the OBO - simply because he seems to preside over the worst sessions for england? Clearly Mike 'the curse' Adamson is very good at what he does and will have every reason to feel aggrieved but surely he must realise that the data clearly shows that his OBO stints are scientifically proven to be bad for English cricket. He will be taking one for the team.\" I would've happily taken that fiver you offered, James, and headed to the pub, but Sean Ingle has taken the editorial decision to land me in the hotseat and initiate the rapid demise of English cricket. As Chris Armstrong says: \"Nothing personal, but with your track record on OBO commentary, I've heard that everyone as far down as Hoggard has padded up.\" 55th over: England 200-2 (Vaughan 95, Bell 17) Glenn McGrath bowls the first over of the session in his usual metronomic style, but he can't stop Vaughan picking up two singles and Bell stroking the ball through the off-side for three to bring up the 200. \"Why don't we re-open the debate on which members of the England squad would get into the Aussie side today,\" says Tom Huddart. \"My money goes on Flintoff, Peterson and Harmison making it straight away, with Trescothick and Vaughan threatening to break into the batting top three. Come to mention it, why don't we throw it the other way. Which Aussies would make it into the England squad? Or am I getting a little carried away? I suppose Warne might get Giles' spot.\" Gilchrist might have a small claim as well. 56th over: England 204-2 (Vaughan 99, Bell 17) Vaughan moves to 99 thanks to a juicy full toss from Warne and some lazy work from McGrath on the boundary, who is clearly looking to protect his ankle in the outfield. Then Warne tests Vaughan's patience by bowling around the wicket and pitching the next five balls into the rough. Vaughan is happy to kick them away. \"Sorry to totally blow everyone out of the water,\" says Jamie Reeman, continuing your tales of brushes with celebrity, \"but I appeared with Ian Botham on the Saturday Morning Picture Show in 1986 with him teaching me how to bat. We ended the show hitting tennis balls at Frank Sidebottom. Beat that.\" 57th over: England 209-2 (Vaughan 102, Bell 18) Bell picks up a single to square leg to give Vaughan four balls with which to bring up his century. But he only needs one, slightly mistiming a drive to mid-off which ends up wide of mid-off. Who cares how he managed it, the bare fact is that he's the first player in the series to have reached three figures. \"I have an idea for you Mike,\" says Ian Rogers. \"Since there tends to be a feeling that you jinx England with you're OBO reporting and the vast majority of your readers are office bound and nowhere near a TV, if things do start to go badly just tell lies and see us all cheerfully through to our 5pm finishes. We'll deal with the truth over an after-work beer!\" I couldn't do that, could I? Could I? 58th over: England 210-2 (Vaughan 103, Bell 18) Shane Warne races through another over bowling around the wicket. Again Vaughan is happy not to use his bat for the first five deliveries until he steps down the wicket on the final ball of the over to pick up one run and retain the strike. \"Former Ireland, Man City and Everton star Terry Phelan once pointed out to me that a copy of FHM had the choice of four different covers when I was working in WHSmiths,\" writes David Edwards. \"This was not much of a surprise to me given that the magazine had 'Special Edition - 4 different covers' written in fairly large letters across it, but you can't expect that much from a man who had to go on international duty with Jason McAteer - a man so stupid he once tried to open the fire exit on a plane 'to let a bit of fresh air in.'\" 59th over: England 211-2 (Vaughan 104, Bell 18) Glenn McGrath, who has given Adam Glichrist a couple of death-stares for dropping two catches, this time has nobody to blame but himself after putting down a simple catch after tricking Bell with his slower ball. Meanwhile, Michael Howard says: \"Jon Pertwee, of Doctor Who and Wurzel Gummidge fame, lived in the house two doors down from me. Not when we lived there though. Of course, the leader of the Tories, shares his name with me, and last but certainly not least I work with the esteemed sport's reporter Sean Ingle's girlfriend's father!! Howzat?\" Not out. 60th over: England 215-2 (Vaughan 108, Bell 18) Warne is continuing with his round-the-wicket approach, but he releases the pressure he has been applying by dragging one short, which Vaughan pulls to the rope on the leg-side. \"When I was living in Budapest in 2002 I was walking drunkenly across the Gellert Bridge at four-thirty in the morning and bumped into Eddie Murphy. He was shooting I-Spy. Terrible film.\" So says Heath Greene, film critic. 61st over: England 215-2 (Vaughan 108, Bell 18) Another lucky escape for Bell as he once again fails to pick McGrath's slower ball. After giving the bowler some catching practice in the previous over, Bell this time tries to test out the cover's fielding, but the ball lands just short. \"There is another story about the same Jason McAteer,\" chuckles Alan Synnott. \"On a flight back from a World Cup qualifier in Latvia or some such place, he asked a teammate why the flight over had taken five hours, but the one back would only take two hours. He was perfectly happy with the answer: 'This pilot knows a short cut'. Marvellous.\" 62nd over: England 217-2 (Vaughan 110, Bell 18) A quiet over until Warne again pulls one short to Vaughan, who seems happy to wait for the bad ball and put it away. Two runs this time. \"Vaughnie would've sneezed and pulled a muscle on 99 if you were cursed, prehaps it has been lifted,\" says Julian Tuddenham, who I fancy may be an Australian who is trying to tempt fate. 63rd over: England 217-2 (Vaughan 110, Bell 18) Bell isn't enjoying himself too much against McGrath, whose probing line and length and mixture of speeds is proving too much for the England No4. The one time McGrath pitches one short of a length outside off stump, Bell has a wild swipe at it, the intended destination being a man in row Q. He missed. \"I reckon Gilchrist is showing that he is learning a great deal from Jones after his drops this morning and his last couple of bats,\" says Shane Brennan with a view to the merging of the two teams. \"Maybe he could get in as wicket-keeper if Jones was injured or something.\" 64th over: England 221-2 (Vaughan 113, Bell 18) Warne bowls his overs incredibly quickly. After Vaughan picks off another bad Warne ball - not often one has the chance to write that phrase - the spin king returns to an over-the-wicket approach. \"Who does Jamie Reeman think he is?\" asks a furious Graeme King. \"The Saturday Morning Picture Show? Try 'Going Live' with Philip Schofield and Sarah Greene back in 1992. I was a competition winner, on the show with Sandy Toksvig and Mike McShane, Right Said Fred miming to 'Deeply Dippy' and Harry Enfield not being very funny. Now that is a true 15 minutes of fame, not to say 1h45m of fame, just before Football Focus on a Saturday morning. Reeman, you're dreaming.\" 65th over: England 231-2 (Vaughan 123, Bell 18) Australian desperation is growing exponentially: Gillespie is back into the attack. And Vaughan scores 10 off the first three balls thanks to a pulled six which just crept over the deep square leg and then a guided stroke - ok, a thickish edge - down to the vacant third man boundary. Great scenes. \"I can tell English morale is improving,\" says Alex Holland, \"as no-one has said 'If we can score so many runs on this pitch, think of what the Aussies will do.\" 66th over: England 231-2 (Vaughan 123, Bell 18) After the waywardness of Gillespie, Warne is back to his consistent best, bowling a maiden to Bell. \"Jason McAteer's nickname for years at Liverpool was Trigger,\" laughs Jim Carter. \"Unsurprising, given that he asked for his pizza to be cut into four and not eight slices as he wasn't that hungry.\" 67th over: England 239-2 (Vaughan 131, Bell 18) Gillespie strays onto leg stump three times in a row and is punished as you might expect by Vaughan with a beautifully timed clip through midwicket for four more, and two more strokes to deep square leg. This particular Gillespie spell may not last too long. \"I'll see Graeme King's Going live and I'll raise him winning 'Two Peas in a Pod' on Mark &amp; Lard on my birthday some years ago. As it was my birthday Lard gave me a special 'biggidy-biggidy-bong' as well. I thrashed the woman I was playing and all I won was a \u00a310 record token!\" 68th over: England 241-2 (Vaughan 131, Bell 20) Big cheers from the crowd for Bell, who scores his first run for 12 overs - make that two runs - when Warne overpitches one. The reply is a sharp turner which Bell gets nowhere near to. \"On Monday I played tennis in Prague,\" says John Edwards innocently enough \"In the court next to us was none other than Mrs Smicer! She was pretty good too.\" Do you mean at tennis, John? 69th over: England 252-2 (Vaughan 137, Bell 25) I'm sure Jason Gillespie used to be a darn good bowler. Well, he certainly doesn't look one now. Yet again Gillespie bowls it down leg-side, and yet again Vaughan smacks it through midwicket to add four to the quickly-growing total. Then Gillespie almost rams my words back down my throat (given the curse, that's not too surprising) by sending through a quicker delivery which Bell inside edges past the stumps for another four. Drinks: \"A further story of Mr McAteer's intelligence told by Neil Ruddock,\" and now told by Steve Hunt, \"was when he'd bought himself a very posh new car that for some reason allowed him to lock his keys in the car and with the engine running. After calling out the police to help him, one of said boys in blue asked Jason to go into the house and bring them out a coat anger ... you guessed it, boy genius brought a wooden one back out!\" 70th over: England 258-2 (Vaughan 142, Bell 25) I don't know what was in the Australians' drinks during the break, but first Warne bowls a short and wide no-ball which Vaughan drills through point, then he finds Vaughan's outside edge but Hayden puts down a fourth drop of the day at slip. It went quickly to him, but he should've clung onto it. \"If no one beats me to it,\" writes Richard Douglas, \"can I relate the story of when Jason McAteer applied to get a platinum credit card?\" You may. \"This was back when he was at Liverpool. Having filled out the name of his employer on the application form, he then turned to a team mate in some confusion: \"What should I put down for Position? I'd say I was naturally central midfield, but I'm playing right wing-back at the moment.'\" 71st over: England 272-2 (Vaughan 156, Bell 25) \"Easy, easy, easy.\" So sing the Old Trafford crowd. Three more classic boundaries for Vaughan off Gillespie's first three balls: a textbook straight drive through mid-off, then a textbook on-drive, then a textbook pull through midwicket. Then he nudges one to McGrath at mid-off for a single, which the big bowler turns into a two by hurling it past Gilchrist for an overthrow. Without meaning to gloat, it's great to see the Aussies in such turmoil. Gillespie has bowled 15 overs for 87 runs. Oh, and no wickets. 72nd over: England 275-2 (Vaughan 156, Bell 28) Ian Bell is doing a uesful job for his captain here, occupying the crease at one end while he builds his confidence and allowing Vaughan to play freely at the other. He picks up three off Warne's over with a little tickle down to fine leg. \"At the Edgbaston test there was much discussion, led by me, of whether Pieterson wears a thong,\" says Andrew Ratcliffe rather worryingly. \"He seems to enjoy wearing figure-hugging semi-transparent trousers and there was little sign of vpl. I concluded that either a thong or skimpy briefs were his underwear of choice. I'd be interested to hear whether anyone can definitively confirm or deny this.\" Anyone brave enough? 73rd over: England 283-2 (Vaughan 163, Bell 29) Gillespie has been belatedly kicked out of the attack and part-time left-arm chinaman Simon Katich drafted back in. He can't stop the flow of runs though. Vaughan takes two steps down the track and plants the ball firmly over midwicket, bisecting the fielders on the boundary. \"I saw Mr McAteer on the streets of Liverpool once at a time when I was organising a charity tombola,\" says Rob Bancroft. \"I asked him if he would donate a signed shirt for our tombola. His reply: 'Who is Tom Bowler?'\" 74th over: England 287-2 (Vaughan 166, Bell 30) Another half-chance for Matthew Hayden at slip as a Bell edge lands at the big man's left foot. Hayden got his outstretched fingers to the ball but couldn't cling on, and umpire Bowden immediately signalled that it was not a catch. \"The reason your jinx is no longer working is because everyone now knows about it,\" writes Natasha Dickinson prematurely. \"It's like telling people what you wish for, it cancels the magic.\" There's over an hour to go yet, Natasha. 75th over: WICKET! Vaughan c McGrath b Katich 166 (England 290-3) That was the only way Vaughan was going to get out today: a juicy full-toss which could have been dispatched anywhere, but was pulled straight to McGrath at cow corner. A fine innings though. 76th over: England 291-3 (Pietersen 1, Bell 33) Pietersen gets off the mark after a (possibly) friendly welcome from Warne, with a nudge to the on-side. Otherwise, an over devoid of talking points. \"It's nearly 5pm - have you been doing as suggested earlier and giving us a rosy story instead to hide your usual bad influence on the team, or is the score really 286-2 with captain fantastic racking up the runs?\" asks a suspicious David Hibell. Well it was, David, but I thought it was time for a wicket to make the story plausible. 77th over: England 296-3 (Pietersen 5, Bell 34) Pietersen steps back and cracks a wide Katich delivery through the off-side. The only surprise is it brings three, not four, runs. \"I think Andrew Ratcliffe (72nd over) should get back to the Trinny &amp; Susannah section of the BBC website,\" says Neil Taylor. \"Talk to the hand, or some other sunch Americanism.\" 78th over: England 299-3 (Pietersen 8, Bell 34) Expressing typical confidence, Pietersen goes after a flighted Warne ball with a huge swing, and ends up almost falling over thanks to an airshot. Warne has a little chuckle to himself. He's probably already nicknamed Pietersen 700. \"I like to think Pietersen abstains from any form of underwear at all, including jock-strap and box, in keeping with his extremely confident manner,\" writes Simon Molony. 79th over: England 305-3 (Pietersen 13, Bell 35) The 300 draws a huge roar from some 20,000 or so beer-fuelled Mancunians, handed to England on a plate as it was by a Brett Lee loosener. And then a classic back-foot drive has the crowd purring again, Kevin Pietersen exhibiting his wide range of strokes. \"Mike, I think that Natasha is the new jinx,\" says Martyn Gaunt (cf over 74). \"Don't display anymore of her mails just in case, it's not worth the risk. Also, should a wicket follow this mail, ban me too!\" 80th over: England 307-3 (Pietersen 14, Bell 36) Pietersen again takes on Warne, mistimes the shot, but a big leading edge just eludes the man at point. Then Bell misreads the slider and chips the ball a yard away from Warne. And then Pietersen clips the ball straight at short leg, but Langer is unable to hold onto the quickly moving ball. England have had a large slice of luck today, but to their credit they've taken full advantage. Mat Thomas writes, clearly looking for a HONK: \"What are the odds of KP going nuts in the last hour?\" 81st over: England 315-3 (Pietersen 17, Bell 41) The new ball is due, but Australia aren't taking it because they obviously think Warne can snare Pietersen at some stage. What it does mean is that Lee is bowling with an 80-over old ball and not extracting the same bounce and speed as he could do. The upshot? Bell's first boundary for 12 overs, cut through the off-side. \"Will Pietersen overtake Bell before the end of play?\" asks Craig Finbow. Not with shots like that. 82nd over: England 315-3 (Pietersen 17, Bell 41) A maiden for Warne, with Bell wisely keeping Pietersen away from the danger end. There are either eight overs or half an hour left tonight. 83rd over: England 315-3 (Pietersen 17, Bell 41) Ponting throws the ball to Katich in an obvious attempt to lure Pietersen into a false sense of security and a similar dismissal to Vaughan's. It doesn't work though, as the power-hitter reluctantly puts his defensive technique on display. Back to your brushes with celebrities. \"Garth Crooks once mistook me for a member of hotel staff and asked me where the press room was in the Radisson when Rio Ferdinand was being banned by the FA for his missed drugs test,\" says Neil Cullingford. \"His question was surprisingly to the point actually.\" 84th over: England 319-3 (Pietersen 17, Bell 45) A sweetly timed and placed shot down the ground from Bell, who is waking up to the fact that he has the ability to play at this level. 85th over: England 325-3 (Pietersen 18, Bell 50) Katich gifts Bell four more runs with a high full-toss outside off stump. Bell duly obliges, and then brings up his first half-century against Australia with an easy single out to deep square leg. It's been a great effort from a man whose place in the side was under pressure before this Test. \"Seeing as we're going so well, is now a good time to discuss when we should declare?\" says Alastair McCulloch. \"I reckon we should try to get to 700 by about 5pm tomorrow, then bowl them out twice in two days and win by an innings in the humiliating style the Aussies used to.\" 86th over: England 331-3 (Pietersen 19, Bell 55) Bell's confidence is growing. Probably his finest shot of the day is a front-foot drive off Warne which flies past extra cover. Neil Taylor says: \"Does anyone else think that Vaughan's managed to swap breakfasts with the Aussie team this morning? Even Mogadon-scoring-rate Bell looks comfortable playing the supporting role. As for Gillespie, he'd struggle to break into the Bangladesh seconds at the minute.\" 87th over: WICKET! Pietersen c sub b Lee 28 (England 333-4) Australia hand Brett Lee the new ball, and he strikes immediately by banging the ball in short and fast. Pietersen attempts a hook but it doesn't come out of the meat of the bat and the ball lands in the safe hands of substitute fielder Brad Hogg. 88th over: England 341-4 (Hoggard 4, Bell 59) The doughty Matthew Hoggard is the man sent in to act as nightwatchman. Having guided one through the slips - and through the hands of Langer (another drop!) - in the last over for four, the Hogg watches admiringly from the non-striker's end as Bell strokes a full ball from McGrath fluently through extra cover. \"It's going to be a draw isn't it?\" says Joshua Hardie rhetorically, not pausing to let me say \"no\". \"England 467 all out, they reply with 523, we struggle to 296 and they are 117 for 3 on Monday night. I can see it.\" So it would seem. 89th over: WICKET! Hoggard b Lee 4 (England 341-5) Brett Lee steams in for the last over of the day in the hope of taking Hoggard's wicket, achieving his aim with the final ball of the day which clipped the top of the batsman's off stump. \"Andrew Ratcliffe was at Edgbaston on Sunday morning, struggling after a heavy evening the night before,\" says Tom Payne with regards to over 72. \"He actually missed the winning wicket as he was slumped in his seat asleep. He did then made up for it by ecstatically vomiting green bile over the poor bloke in the seat in front.\" And that's the end of play. On the whole, it's been another good day for England. Join us tomorrow for the latest instalment. Thanks for all your emails, Mike."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
