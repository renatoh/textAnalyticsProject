Fabio Capello's side should win today's match with Kazakhstan before defeating Andorra at Wembley, but the men asked to give England a full season of uninterrupted victories in qualifiers are in far from impeccable condition. Half of the likely line-up have been absorbed quite recently in bids for Champions League, Premier League or FA Cup. The manager reacts to that in his usual trenchant manner. \"We have to win,\" Capello said. \"Everyone must play to their best. No excuses that we are tired, we want to go on holiday. No.\" At least the opposition are in a shaky state of their own for different reasons. The manager, Bernd Storck, protests that the leading clubs in Kazakhstan are unco-operative and will not help him raise the players' fitness to an acceptable level. He also happens to lack his injured captain, Ruslan Baltiev. The side has been beaten 5\u20131 in successive qualifiers by England and Belarus. Come next Wednesday night, Capello's side ought to have 21 points in Group Six, which will leave them all but unassailable. He was probably sincere when predicting difficulties against Kazakhstan, whose collapse at Wembley did not come until the closing stages. The Central Stadium will be full today, with crowd and players alike stimulated by the arrival of England. Nonetheless, Capello has been favoured by almost perfect circumstances. The FA served him brilliantly when the schedule was being negotiated. Although the England squad will feel jaded, they can buck themselves up by confirming that they are merely being asked to get the better of Kazakhstan and Andorra, who stand 132nd and 196th in the world, respectively. Capello's men are sixth. The much-mocked administrators were in prime form when they got agreement over the order of the matches. England even have the potential for a strong finish, with three of the four closing games in the group at Wembley. The single concession of note seems to have been the agreement to go to Zagreb last September, when Capello might still have been struggling to knock his team into shape. It was Croatia who were left in a disorderly condition by a Theo Walcott hat-trick in the 4\u20131 victory. Circumstances can still irk dominant sides. England have enjoyed a single clean sheet so far in the group and it barely counts since it was achieved against Andorra in Barcelona. Injuries have denied Capello the consistency of selection he would have desired in the middle of defence and Rio Ferdinand is an absentee today, but there is justice in the manager's claim that he has emphasised the forthright characteristics of English football. The team has 16 goals from its five qualifiers. There is no indication of any let-up. Walcott himself will be sent on from the fixture with Andorra to play for the Under-21s in the European Championship in Sweden. Capello, a man of old-school temperament despite his mastery of the contemporary game, supposes that the Arsenal player's months of injury were respite enough, even if Walcott most likely experienced that spell as a time of anxiety and doubt. Fans can rest easy, at least, that nobody is being mollycoddled. The match with Kazakhstan will carry its element of discomfort. Grand in conception though the stadium may have been, it does not offer ideal conditions. The England squad's state of readiness is, on the other hand, not at all bad. Whimsical call-offs are a thing of the past. The goalkeeping department is the one section to be blighted, but it may do no harm to see how Robert Green deals with an awkward setting when, as is expected, he makes his first start under Capello. After all, a challenger to David James will be sought when the veteran returns from surgery. Glen Johnson, for his part, is likely to get a fifth consecutive start at right-back, although three of those outings have been in friendlies. Wes Brown must appreciate that there is work to be done if he is to recover his place once he is fully fit again. If there is a mixture of keenness to return and a consciousness that it will be no simple task, then Capello has fostered a healthy environment. Access to the squad is regularly denied. Many might have supposed that Michael Owen would be readmitted as soon as he had made his comeback for his club. Capello, though, has been vindicated in his resolve that the striker would first have to make a real impact in the Premier League. He could not do so and was soon demoted to the bench as Alan Shearer struggled unsuccessfully to keep Newcastle in the top flight. Capello's policy does leave him short of forwards. Speed alone has not seen Gabriel Agbonlahor retain his spot in the party. Attention turns now towards men such as Carlton Cole, although Peter Crouch has greater status after scoring the opener in the 2\u20131 victory over Ukraine at Wembley in April. On the other hand, Wayne Rooney could not come up with a goal then, on an occasion when his partnership with Emile Heskey was broken. The latter has had an awkward time since the switch from Wigan to Aston Villa in January, but Capello may feel bound to check that Heskey and Rooney still enhance one another. If Kazakhstan should show more doggedness today, that sort of rapport will be vital to maintain England's momentum in the qualifiers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
