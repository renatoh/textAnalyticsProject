According to the Intercept, S\u00e9rgio Moro gave prosecutors strategic advice, criticism and tips during the sprawling corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash that jailed hundreds of executives, politicians and middlemen. Prosecutors also allegedly discussed strategies to block a newspaper\u2019s attempts to interview Lula during last year\u2019s election campaign, according to the Intercept, which published cellphone chats it said it had received from an anonymous source. Opinion polls had indicated that Lula was likely to win the 2018 presidential poll until he was imprisoned and forced out of the race. His last-minute replacement, Fernando Haddad was beaten by the far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 who then appointed Moro as justice minister. Lula has been imprisoned since April 2018. He was handed a nine-year prison sentence in 2017 by Moro, who ruled that he received bribes from a construction company in the shape of a seaside apartment renovated for him. On Sunday, the Intercept published excerpts from what it described as an \u201cenormous trove\u201d of group chats on the encrypted phone app Telegram, along with audio, video and other documentation. Excerpts of conversations between prosecutors on the Telegram cellphone app appear to show Deltan Dallagnol, the lead prosecutor in the Car Wash investigation, expressing doubts over the strength of the case against Lula in September 2016, four days before filing the indictment. \u201cIt\u2019s like stopping the other team from playing. Its like they decided to play the ball alone,\u201d said Carlos Melo, a professor of political science at the S\u00e3o Paulo business school Insper. \u201cA basic principle of law is that those who accuse do not judge.\u201d Other messages appeared to show that during the election campaign, prosecutors schemed against a decision by a supreme court judge to allow Brazil\u2019s Folha de S Paulo newspaper to interview Lula in jail because it could help his Workers\u2019 party\u2019s electoral chances. \u201cThe judge\u2019s relationship with prosecutors is scandalous,\u201d said the Intercept Brasil\u2019s executive editor, Leandro Demori. \u201cThis is illegal under Brazilian law.\u201d In a statement on Sunday night, Moro said the disclosures \u201cdid not show any abnormality\u201d and that they \u201cignored the giant corruption scheme revealed by Operation Car Wash\u201d. The minister also complained about the \u201ccriminal invasion\u201d of prosecutors\u2019 phones. Demori declined to discuss how the site had obtained the material, other than to say that it came from an anonymous source. He said the archive was bigger than that revealed by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden to the Rio-based journalist Glenn Greenwald \u2013 who later set up the Intercept and co-wrote Sunday\u2019s articles. Bolsonaro has yet to comment but his son Carlos shared a tweet noting that Greenwald\u2019s husband is congressman David Miranda from the leftist Socialism and Freedom party. Prosecutors said in a statement they had been subject to a \u201ccriminal act\u201d by a hacker which had compromised their safety with \u201cthe objective of impeding the continuity of the operation\u201d. \u201cMany conversations, without due context, can give way to misinterpretations,\u201d they said. Brazilian leftists \u2013 who have long argued that Lula was unjustly convicted \u2013 said the revelations proved they were right. \u201cIt is harder and harder to deny the judicial persecution of Lula,\u201d said Jean Paul Prates, a Workers\u2019 party senator in a statement. In February this year, Lula was handed a separate, 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering over a country property that prosecutors argued was also renovated for him by companies involved in the same graft scheme. He denies the charges and is appealing but also faces several other corruption cases. Geoffrey Robertson, the lawyer handling Lula\u2019s appeal to the United Nations human rights committee said the disclosures showed Moro was biased. \u201cLula should now be released from prison and Moro and certain police officers prosecuted for preventing justice,\u201d he said in a statement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
