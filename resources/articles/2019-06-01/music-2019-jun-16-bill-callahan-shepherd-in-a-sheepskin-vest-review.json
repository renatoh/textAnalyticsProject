It\u2019s just one instance of pregnant understatement on a 20-track album that ends this extraordinary American songwriter\u2019s six years away from the release schedules. Life happened: marriage, a baby son, the death of his mother and now, a purple patch of tunes that combine the allusive rigour of his finest work with a looser, chatty style. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be writing again,\u201d he offers on Writing. The Ballad of the Hulk, a meditation on anger, playfully details how Callahan \u201cshared a tailor\u201d with the superhero. Since 2009\u2019s Sometimes I Wish We Were an Eagle, Callahan\u2019s deconstructed Americana has flowed as lyrically as his thoughts. Here, straightforward prettiness often abounds, particularly on the country-leaning tracks, some with the odd female backing coo. It\u2019s sufficient to support the idea of this 16th LP (his first 11 were under the name Smog) as a domestic pastorale. But Callahan\u2019s gnomic half-smile and his ability to pull the rug out under certainties remain. The shepherd\u2019s in a sheepskin waistcoat, after all \u2013 capable of betrayal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
