Pythagoras would have been pleased with some of the angles Adelaide ran against the Wanderers last week but their failure to convert a number of smartly constructed chances saw them slip to sixth on the table (from a high of third two weeks ago), one point behind this week\u2019s opponents Sydney, who were outplayed by 10-man Brisbane and lucky to escape with a draw. The respective points earned by Adelaide and Sydney were, of course, better than a night of interpretive dance, but they weren\u2019t enough to give either club any kind of breathing space, and odds are that if any of the chasing pack are to sneak into the finals it will come at the expense of one of these teams, which just adds to the importance of Friday night\u2019s match. Despite their inferior position on the ladder, you\u2019d pick Adelaide to win, for the same reason you\u2019d pick a man with a topographical map, over a man without one, to emerge first from the wilderness. Yes, they\u2019ve had to backtrack a few times, but Josep Gombau\u2019s side just seem to have a clear sense of where they\u2019re going. Sydney have looked better balanced since Sasa Ognenovski and his enormous shorts slipped into the Blues\u2019 backline, but Sydney are still prone to crippling bouts of disorientation, like those headlong rushes into dense pockets of bush. That said, Sydney\u2019s biggest issue last week was not the lack of a map but a startling lack of ambition. It was as if Sydney were playing with 10, not Brisbane. Interviewed after the game Frank Farina bemoaned this fact, as if he had nothing to do with it. If Sydney (who welcome back Alessandro Del Piero this week) hope to avoid a dogfight in the final rounds they\u2019ll need to take some risks and extend their reach. Starting Friday night. Defence is the best form of defence They haven\u2019t won in Brisbane since November 2009 but Melbourne Victory will venture to Queensland on Saturday with optimism. On Saturday, a last-minute Archie Thompson winner against Perth lifted them into second place in the A-League, then they backed up three days later to defeat Japanese side Yokohama F Marinos (no relation to Lex) in the Asian Champions League. It was their fourth win in five games (in all competitions) and their first clean sheet in 16 matches, which gives you a fair idea of where Melbourne have struggled this season (the worst defence in the league, no less). Injuries and poor form have seen the Victory\u2019s back four reshuffled constantly this season, as if Kevin Muscat is trying to hide a joker in the pack (who may or may not be Pablo Contreras depending on your opinion of him). As a consequence, the backline has often looked out of synch, which is particularly dangerous when a 4-2-2-2 formation exposes your flanks like a poorly fitting toga. Jason Geria, Contreras, Dylan Murnane and Adrian Leijer, returning from injury, started at the back against Yokohama, but Adama Traore and Nick Ansell will surely be reinserted for the game against the Roar as Muscat looks to manage his team\u2019s recent busy schedule. Whoever plays at the back can take some solace that a certain Albanian won\u2019t be playing (not because he\u2019s recovering from \u2013 it appeared to me \u2013 being Tasered last week, but due to being sent off and suspended) but then Besart Berisha missed the last match between these teams and the Roar won 3-0. Which just illustrates Brisbane\u2019s multi-faceted attacking threat that always seems undeterred by personnel changes. But for all that the Roar\u2019s defence could face some stern questions of their own. Kosta Barbarouses, James Troisi and Thompson have all found the goal of late while Brisbane\u2019s defence has had an unsettled preparation. James Donachie and Corey Brown are out, while fellow defenders Ivan Franjic and Jade North have struggled with niggles all week. Brisbane have had one hand on the Premier\u2019s Plate for some time now but they\u2019ve still much to do to against the Victory to get their other hand on it (the Plate that is). Can the Mariners endure a Heart attack? Looking back on the Central Coast Mariners\u2019 season to date \u2013 which isn\u2019t recommended \u2013 it\u2019s a struggle to recall any highs. Graham Arnold left, Michael McGlinchey, Trent Sainsbury and Daniel McBreen departed, Marcos Flores was ruled out with a season-ending knee injury, and there are memories of them getting pumped 4-0 by Adelaide and 4-1 by Wellington. So in summary, perhaps the central image of the Mariners\u2019 season to date is Phil Moss looking as ill at ease in his suit as a wombat in a tuxedo. Yet a look at the A-League table shows the Mariners are fourth. What kind of witchcraft is at play here? But then again haven\u2019t the Mariners always found a way? It\u2019s in their DNA. So for all the lows this season they\u2019ve kept on doing enough to stay in touch, just as last week\u2019s 3-1 win over Newcastle showed. Sure, they\u2019ve rarely done so with any flourish, and never with a deluge of goals, but here they are nonetheless possibly five or six points away from assuring themselves a spot in the finals. But like the last 100 kms of a 1,000 km drive, or the last 49 years of a 50-year marriage, that final effort is often the hardest, and on Sunday the Mariners will face a desperate Melbourne Heart who are clinging onto mathematical possibilities rather than common sense and will thus throw caution to the wind. It could be that the result hinges on the whether the Mariners\u2019 unprolific strike force of Mitchell Duke, Bernie Ibini, Mile Sterjovski and Kim Seung-Yong can take advantage of the Heart\u2019s headlong rush for victory. Who will be the best of the rest? Thanks to some poor refereeing as much as the efforts of their opponents, Wellington endured a luckless day against the Melbourne Heart last week, but the point they earned was just enough to get a foot in the finals door before it slammed shut. More or less alongside them, though with a toe in front, are the seventh-placed Newcastle Jets, Wellington\u2019s opponent this week. It\u2019s an encounter with the feel of an elimination final, so Wellington \u2013 already stretched by long-term injuries \u2013 will sorely miss the ingenuity of Carlos Hernandez who is battling a calf injury. The Phoenix will also have to adjust for the suspended Ben Sigmund, which could see Michael Boxall shift to central defence alongside Andrew Durante, with Manny Muscat dropping back to right-back. By comparison, Newcastle are fairly settled, if only sporadically threatening. Michael Bridges will come into the squad, while Ben Kennedy is expected to start ahead of Mark Birighitti who has been rested (or is dumped the correct word?) as a direct result of two errors (or is howlers the right word?) against the Mariners last week in the Not Sydney Derby. His coach Clayton Zane tried to put a positive spin on it, saying \u201csometimes letting a young player have a bit of a rest can be a good thing\u201d but Birighitti may have trouble seeing it that way. Still, at least he\u2019ll now be able to bite his fingernails on the sideline alongside the rest of the fans inside Hunter Stadium. Time for the Wanderers to pick up the pace Last week the Western Sydney Wanderers found themselves out of the top two for the first time since October but if any heads dropped they were soon lifted by the team\u2019s midweek win in the Asian Champions League. On the one hand, it\u2019s a hindrance being involved in a second competition so close to the finals but, as Josep Gombau said last week, it has the benefits of providing motivation for players, as well as exposing the team to quality opposition ahead of the hothouse environment of the A-League finals. The Wanderers don\u2019t want to limp into the finals, however, so perhaps Kenny Lowe\u2019s luckless, friendless Perth will prove themselves the whipping boy in the Wanderers\u2019 effort to end a three-match winless A-League run and create some momentum. Matthew Spiranovic and Shinji Ono both make their return from injury and with Tony Popovic sure to make enough changes to combat accumulating fatigue (I wonder if he\u2019ll rest Brendon Santalab who may be distracted by his coming \u2013 and belated \u2013 hearing with the FFA after he was accused of vilifying Sydney\u2019s Ali Abbas a couple of weeks ago) this looks as safe a bet as any A-League match in quite some time. Which means, of course, don\u2019t bet on it.
