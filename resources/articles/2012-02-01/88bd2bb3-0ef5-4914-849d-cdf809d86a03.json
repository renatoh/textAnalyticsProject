In addition to gnats and flies which abound in sheltered sun-warmed spots, a few moths are appearing. A spring usher, a February moth, which I disturbed from a bush in a thick wood, brought this fact to mind. A week ago a butterfly was captured in a house in Stockport, but my informant does not mention the species. Very likely it was a small tortoiseshell, a fly which habitually hibernates. This fly does not usually leave its winter quarters until March, or April, though it has been seen flying over snow-covered fields in February. It is likely too, that it was accidentally disturbed, and its vitality having been increased by the temperature, it was aroused to activity by a stimulus which would not have affected it had the weather been colder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
