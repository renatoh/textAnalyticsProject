Ireland looked to be heading for a first defeat in the competition after substitute Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg had given the Danes the lead four minutes after coming off the bench but Duffy\u2019s 85th-minute bullet header, his third international goal, was enough to claim a point at the Telia Parken Stadium and preserve the unbeaten start Mick McCarthy\u2019s side had made to their Group D campaign. Jesus Navas fired his first international goal in six years as Spain thrashed the Faroe Islands 4-1 in Torshavn to stay top of Group F. The Sevilla winger has come in from the cold under Spain manager Luis Enrique, who was absent from the game for personal reasons, earning his first caps in five years. Navas, who last scored for Spain in September 2013, Sergio Ramos, Jose Gaya and an own goal from the goalkeeper, Teitur Gestson, sealed Spain\u2019s third straight win in Euro 2020 qualifying. In Podgorica Montenegro\u2019s Serbian-born coach and two players boycotted their Group A qualifier against Kosovo after pressure from Serbia. Ljubisa Tumbakovic and players Marko Ivanic and Filip Stojkovic did not take part in the match, which ended 1-1, though three other ethnic Serbs were with the team. According to reports, Montenegro\u2019s football association is poised to sack Tumbakovic for the protest. State-controlled media in Serbia launched a campaign against Serbs playing in games with Kosovo, which declared its independence from the country in 2008. Serbia does not recognise Kosovo\u2019s statehood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
