There are jockeys and trainers who determinedly praise their better horses, even in defeat, in the hope of shoring up their stud value, but the champion jockey will never be able to play that game with a straight face and instead offers a downbeat assessment of the horse he will probably ride in next month's Derby. \"He's been hyped up by the media, really, everyone's saying he's a good horse,\" was Moore's verdict in the weighing room here yesterday. Asked where the enthusiasm for Workforce had come from, he replied: \"From the press! I don't know if it's from stable lads or not but it hasn't come from me or the trainer, so some people have made it up.\" Workforce is no bigger than 8-1 for the Derby on 5 June, despite having been seen on a racecourse only once in his short life, when winning a \u00a33,000 maiden at Goodwood in September. Admittedly he won easily, beating a horse that has won twice since then, but that form by itself would be scant justification for such short odds. Anyone backing him now is doing so on the basis of his reputation. That reputation will be tested tomorrow, when Workforce lines up at York for the Dante Stakes, which has been the most reliable trial race for the Epsom Classic in recent seasons. His five opponents include Chabal and Coordinated Cut, both winners this year who did well enough as juveniles to be tried in Group One contests. \"It'll be nice to get him out and have a look at him and see what we've got,\" says Moore. \"I've not ridden him much [on the gallops] in the winter, just the last few times over the last couple of weeks. We'll see how we go with him. He's been working fine but we haven't really got stuck into him yet.\" Unless many punters have been barking up the wrong tree, Workforce has a serious chance of giving the champion his first Derby success but, if Moore is excited by the prospect, he is keeping his emotions under iron control. \"It's still a month away and it's early days. \"He's second-favourite just by the fact that nothing else has come out and been impressive. He's a nice type of horse. He is a bit big but . . . that's the way he's made.\" Moore is grinning now, knowing that the last sentence, in response to a question about the horse's physical progress, is not especially helpful. He does not care. He has been bumped up against the limit of his tolerance for intrusive questions and must now get dressed for the first of seven rides. Still he puts in a good word for Main Aim, his mount in today's Duke of York Stakes, one of four races live on Channel 4. \"He'll run a good race,\" says Moore, who is unconcerned by the drop back to six furlongs for a horse who certainly ran well over greater distance on several occasions last year. \"I don't always think that a horse necessarily has a best trip and this one seems quite versatile.\" Main Aim may be undone at York this afternoon by Starspangledbanner (3.10), who won a Grade One race in Australia in February before being sold to Coolmore for a reported A$10m, equivalent to around \u00a36m. The success of Australian speedsters when brought to this country is a familiar story and Starspangledbanner can give Aidan O'Brien a first success in Britain this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
