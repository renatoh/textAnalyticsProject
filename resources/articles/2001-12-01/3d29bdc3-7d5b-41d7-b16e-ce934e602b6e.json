And it was with the attitude of someone just sorting out a bit of a mess that he knocked the ball away from his stumps yesterday and so became the seventh batsman in Test cricket to be given out for handling the ball. It was an aberration, how ever innocent, which could ultimately prove to have handed India the series. Vaughan was batting as beautifully as at any time in his Test career and had promised to lead England to a position of authority. Instead, at 255 for six at the close of the first day, the best they could claim was parity. The ball was undoubtedly moving when Vaughan, on 64, having missed a sweep at Sarandeep Singh, first smothered it with a glove, then knocked it vaguely away from his crease. The fact that it was not endangering his stumps remains, so far as the law is concerned, a monumental irrelevance. Had he picked the ball up and tossed it to a member of the fielding side, an Indian appeal would have been unlikely and, if it had been made, would have been given scant consideration by the umpire. But he did not. When he grabbed the ball he looked momentarily confused, drawn into a miscalculation. Sarandeep had the right to appeal and the umpire Arani Jayaprakash was correct to give it. Vaughan's self-righteousness, underpinned no doubt by an aggrieved attitude in an England dressing room with a Test to win, was understandable but unfortunate. This was an increasingly surreal day all round. A muckily overcast day ensured that England had their first taste of batting under floodlights in Test cricket and the experience had something of the night about it. For players to leave the field in the final session with the floodlights blazing and the light perfectly acceptable showed that the light that cricket prefers to be seen in is still a ridiculous one. Denis Lindsay, the South African match referee, then kindly explained the logic with which a starting time of 9.30 could that morning have been put back to 10.00 because of early-morning dew but had now been advanced on the second day to 9.44 because of time lost to bad light. These things are of national importance. Test Match Special is beside itself because of unforeseen clashes on Radio 4 long wave with Yesterday in Parliament and the Shipping Forecast. What was so galling for England was that, until Vaughan's demise, it was possible to imagine they might grandly tie the series at the last. Nasser Hussain amazed himself by winning another toss with Lindsay's coin - forget joining the Euro; there is a sound cricketing argument here for joining the rand - which accentuated the feeling that India's selection of three spinners was muddled. This is a relaid pitch, never used before for a first-class match. Those who have evaded security suggest it resembles crazy paving but, if the cold weather persists, it might never break up to provide the fierce turn that had been expected. Meanwhile the old trouper, Javagal Srinath, was full of teeth and looked comfortably India's most dangerous bowler as he swung the ball under overcast skies. If England's seamers expose some erratic bounce as the match wears on, they are in the game. The sight of Sourav Ganguly taking the new ball almost tilted England's openers into overexcitement. He did find some inswing to the left-handers, appealing for a couple of lbw appeals like a little boy and responding to their refusal like a sulky teenager. Marcus Trescothick never came to terms with Srinath, who made a ball climb to have him caught at second slip. Hussain began friskily, pulling Srinath emphatically for six and aggressively using his feet against the off-spin of Harbhajan Singh. Hussain was not so frisky, however, that he fancied Mark Butcher's call for a single to Rahul Dravid at cover and he had turned his back long before Butcher was run out. Hussain's self-admonishing punch of the air after he edged a fine delivery from Srinath to the wicketkeeper soon after lunch was a recognition that he had been batting for two people. With Vaughan on-driving Harbhajan superbly and Sarandeep, another Sikh off-spinner, resembling a slightly inferior version of the same thing, England forged a recovery. Vaughan's apologetic air, with drooping head and hand politely touching his helmet peak after every ball, could not disguise his mastery. His innings remained in abeyance in the 30s and he edged one ball from Sachin Tendulkar just short of slip. But his only real failure was to sweep two balls into the body of the perpetually suffering Shiv Sunder Das at short-leg without causing him to leave the field for further treatment. Vaughan's demise demanded that England retrenched. Instead, in waltzed Andrew Flintoff, who belted his fourth ball, from Sarandeep, to mid-wicket and, another nought registered, walked off in the misguided belief it was just another case of bad karma. Mark Ramprakash, highly impressive for 58, was then adjudged caught at slip off Sarandeep. The deflections came off Ramprakash's body and Deep Dasgupta's gloves but Jayaprakash, perhaps assuming with good reason that Dasgupta had got nowhere near it, raised his finger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
