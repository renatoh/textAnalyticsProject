I worked with John Mitchell at Wasps. We get on, enjoy chatting about rugby and visit each other whenever we can. No surprise then that I think the New Zealand board has been amazingly short-sighted in giving him the push, effectively because he didn't win the World Cup. Mitchell was in charge of the All Blacks for not much over two years. In that time he set New Zealand on course for future glory and produced the most exciting team at the World Cup. Going into the tournament they were the favourites, having set a blistering pace in the Tri- Nations, which they won with a week to spare. He was brave in ending the international careers of Christian Cullen, Andrew Mehrtens and Taine Randell, and had the vision to produce a back line that included the likes of Joe Rokocoko, Doug Howlett and Carlos Spencer. If Mitchell made a mistake it was in failing to select one or two \"old heads\" - guys who knew what to do when things started to go wrong with Plan A - although he wasn't helped by the injury to the veteran centre Tana Umaga. Admittedly, he pushed a few noses out of joint when it came to handling the media and sponsors. But if you know anything about New Zealand rugby and the expectations on the national team, you will understand that it's pretty easy to rub someone up the wrong way down there. But just think of the legacy he leaves. I'll bet that if you asked the bookies for odds on the 2007 World Cup in France, they would make New Zealand the favourites. Such a shame then that the New Zealand blazers did not show the same backbone in dealing with Mitchell as Twickenham did when Clive Woodward limped home from the 1999 tournament. There had been suggestions that Mitchell would return to England - remember he was Woodward's right-hand man for a time and coached Sale - or take up an offer from a French side. But yesterday he signed a three-year contract to coach the Waikato Chiefs. My guess is that he will stay for a few years while his family grows up, and then look around. New Zealand might eventually realise the mistake they have made, but until then the national side has been handed over to Graham Henry, which will add a little novelty to the 2005 visit of the Lions. If the Lions go for Woodward as their coach as seems likely - Bill Beaumont has already had a preliminary chat and I can't see anyone else in the frame - then Henry will be going head to head with the man who was less than complimentary about the way the 2001 Lions were handled in Australia. And they (I'm sure you've guessed what's coming) were coached by Henry; winning the first Test but going down 2-1 after the wheels came off. Were that not tasty enough, add the extra spice that Steve Hansen - Henry's deputy and then successor for a turbulent two years with Wales - and Wayne Smith, the coach at Northampton, are tipped to make up the All Black coaching panel. Woodward, in turn, is likely to insist that his England coaching team supports him in New Zealand. So you have a Lions set-up that is known, down to the smallest detail, by the three men given the task of de-railing the cream of northern-hemisphere rugby. Better still, Woodward will have taken his England side to New Zealand for a two-Test series a year earlier and, as England are likely to take up the majority of the Lions places, we will have two coaches, both known to be meticulous and analytical in their approach, armed to the teeth with all the stats and facts they need to produce a fantastic series. And just to make things even better, I can't see Woodward labouring under the niceties of protocol when it comes to selecting his squad. He'll want things his way and if that means leaving a lot of Scots and Welsh at home, then so be it. We are still a couple of years away from taking that difficult decision, but I believe it will be England plus a good contingent from Ireland - the likes of Malcolm O'Kelly, Paul O'Connell, Brian O'Driscoll, Keith Gleeson, Ronan O'Gara and Peter Stringer - a few Welsh led by Jonathan Thomas, and not too many Scots boarding the plane to the Land of the Long White Cloud. Forget Malaga and the Maldives this year. Start saving for Auckland and Wellington 2005."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
