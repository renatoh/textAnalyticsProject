Young has started just once for Manchester United this term after impressing in Louis van Gaal\u2019s first season in charge and although he was under consideration for a call-up in May he was not selected by Hodgson due to a slight injury and advice from the Old Trafford medical department that rest would better serve the 30-year-old winger. Over the summer Young\u2019s Manchester United future was cast into doubt when Van Gaal said, \u201cHe had a fantastic season. But he is not a Neymar\u201d, but he agreed a new three-year deal in August, although he has been largely restricted to appearances from the bench this term. As a result he is not expecting to be included when Hodgson names his squad for next month\u2019s Euro 2016 qualifiers against Estonia and Lithuania on Thursday, despite an impressive cameo against Sunderland on Saturday, but he dismissed any suggestions that he would rule himself unavailable for international duty in the future. \u201cI am not to sure about the England situation. I am as in the dark as you,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I have to play well for United to have a chance and then you hope the England manager comes knocking on the door. If that happens it happens but at the moment I am concentrating on United. \u201cI am always going to make myself available as long as my legs can carry me around the pitch. I will never think about retiring from England until I retire from football completely at club level. That is not going to happen soon. I feel fit if the call comes then it comes. It was a long time ago. Roy Hodgson was in touch at the end of last season. I had a slight problem with my achilles. I was disappointed not to join up.\u201d Despite just one Premier League start, Young was selected in Manchester United\u2019s 2-1 Champions League loss to PSV Eindhoven earlier this month \u2013 a match marred by Luke Shaw\u2019s double leg break and a defeat that means Wednesday\u2019s encounter with Wolfsburg takes on extra significance for the Premier League leaders. \u201cIt is important to get a win against Wolfsburg. If you want to win the Champions league then you have to win your home games,\u201d added Young. \u201cIt was a disappointing start to the European campaign especially the possession and chances we had in Eindhoven that really was disappointing. We have start winning in the group now. \u201cLuke\u2019s injury was very disappointing. I have been in touch with him and been speaking to him and he seems very positive. The manager has said how surprised he was how positive he is but that is the type of kid he is.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
