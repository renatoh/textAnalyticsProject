Employees at businesses, subway stations, hospitals, universities, schools, religious community centers, and news organizations throughout Toronto, California, New York, Massachusetts, Florida, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Mississippi, Utah, Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina received emails threatening detonation of an \u201cexplosive device\u201d placed somewhere in the building unless they pay $20,000 in bitcoin. The Rush Copley Medical Center in Aurora, Illinois, posted on Twitter that the bomb threat received by employees earlier was not deemed credible and did not compromise patient care. Police at Michigan State University said they were working with federal authorities regarding the threats and \u201cdoes not advise persons to pay the bitcoin ransom\u201d. Employees at the News and Observer in Raleigh, North Carolina, and the Valdosta Daily Times in Georgia tweeted about evacuating because of the bomb threats. Police in Calgary and Toronto posted on Twitter that they, too, were investigating threats, but, like their US law enforcement counterparts, did not have \u201cany reason to believe they are credible\u201d. \u201cHowever, out of an abundance of caution we are treating each as if it is real,\u201d Calgary police said. Meanwhile, several employees who received the emails posted the messages on social media. It is unclear who is behind the the messages, or what agency will be investigating such a wide-scale and international incident."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
