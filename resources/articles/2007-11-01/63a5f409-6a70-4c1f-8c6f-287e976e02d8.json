In November 1974, the IRA had planted bombs in two Birmingham pubs that resulted in 21 deaths and 162 wounded. The following summer, six men were accused of having carried out the bombings. During the proceedings, Bridge was unwell, and there were interruptions while he consulted a dentist, sought treatment for acute gastritis, had an after-lunch nap on his doctor's orders, and lost his voice while summing up. But what rankled far more with the defendants was his apparent bias towards the prosecution. Bridge made it plain that he believed in the confessions that the police had obtained, and did not believe that they had been beaten out of the defendants. He also came in for criticism for his onslaught on the forensic expert who pointed out that the Greiss test for explosives, which the prosecution said showed that two of the six had handled explosives, was riddled with doubt. The forensic evidence available at the trial had changed beyond recognition by the time that the House of Lords eventually allowed the defendants' third appeal, in 1991, after 16 years in prison. Lord Justice Lloyd was explicit in not criticising Bridge's handling of the original trial, and said that it was \"not surprising\" that the judge had ruled that the confessions were made voluntarily, given the lack of bruising on the men when they came before the magistrates. For his own part, in an interview in 1992, Bridge expressed unease about the case, but denied that he felt guilty. \"It is so easy to be wise after the event,\" he said. \"The important question is: 'how do we prevent it happening in the future?' \" Nigel Bridge never knew his father, a naval officer, who abandoned his mother very soon after his birth. Bridge won a scholarship to Marlborough college, Wiltshire, but left aged 17 to travel in France and Germany. On his return he tried his hand at journalism, working on two local papers in Lancashire. Before the war he was rejected by the Fleet Air Arm due to colour blindness, but, in 1940, he was called up and later commissioned in the King's Royal Rifle Corps, serving in Italy, north-west Europe and Germany. He gained a taste for advocacy when, with no prior legal experience, he successfully defended a young soldier court-martialled for desertion. Similar cases followed, so he determined to read for the bar after demob. He was called by Inner Temple in 1947, and specialised in town and country planning and local government law. He was appointed a junior Treasury counsel in 1964, and, in 1968, a judge of the high court, Queen's bench division. He could be quite testy, and the criminal division of the court of appeal occasionally rebuked him for ridiculing what he saw as specious defences. His elevation to the court of appeal came straight after the Birmingham Six trial, and five years later he was made a lord of appeal in ordinary - a law lord. From 1982 to 1985, he was chairman of the Security Commission, conducting the inquiry into the resignation of the Queen's bodyguard, Commander Michael Trestrail, who had been involved with a male prostitute, and drawing up a blueprint for the future vetting of palace servants. He examined the case of the MI5 spy Michael Bettaney, who had passed secrets to the Soviets, and the diplomat Rhona Ritchie, who had passed secrets to her Egyptian lover; Bridge urged ambassadors to take a closer interest in the sex lives of their subordinates. When he took just three days to clear successive governments over 6,129 instances of alleged telephone tapping by MI5, Roy Jenkins branded him a \"poodle of the executive\", but soon after, during the Spycatcher case in 1987, he demonstrated his independence by his dissenting judgment, in which he called the government's attempts to suppress Peter Wright's book a \"significant step down the road to censorship - the indispensable tool of totalitarianism\". He delivered the main judgment in a variety of other cases in the Lords, including the well-known McCloughlin case, in which he ruled that a mother could recover damages for the \"nervous shock\" she had suffered on discovering that her daughter had been killed and her husband and another daughter injured in a car crash. Bridge gained his first degree, in maths, from the Open University in 2003. His wife Margaret, whom he married in 1944, died last year, and he is survived by a son and two daughters. Chris Mullin writes: Bridge was a judge of the old school. \"I am of the opinion,\" he told the jurors as he summed up in the trial of the Birmingham Six, \"not shared by all my brothers on the bench, that, if the judge has formed a clear view, it is much better to let the jury see that and say so and not pretend to be a kind of Olympian detached observer.\" He was as good as his word. More than once during the trial he offered explanations for apparent contradictions in the prosecution case that exceeded in ingenuity those offered by crown counsel. Several times he went so far as to take over the questioning of witnesses when he thought crown counsel was not doing well enough. On one occasion, when a policeman briefly strayed off script, Bridge swiftly guided him back to terra firma. Nor did Bridge use his considerable intellect to analyse the prosecution case with a fraction of the same rigour that he applied to the defence. The supposed confessions of four of the defendants were riddled with contradictions and inaccuracies - they differed as to the number and location of the bombs and the number of bombers; they said the bombs were in plastic bags whereas they turned out to be in small cases. I have asked myself many times why an intelligent man like Bridge, in other respects decent and honourable, could have behaved so appallingly. The answer, I guess, is that although he realised that the defendants had been mistreated in police custody, he also believed, on the basis of the forensic evidence, that they were guilty, and was determined that any mistreatment should not undermine the prospect of conviction. After the convictions had eventually been quashed, I did contact him to see if he would discuss the case, but he declined. Louis Blom-Coooper writes: In the court of appeal, Bridge showed great prowess in counterbalancing the eccentricities of Lord Denning. In a case involving the grant of a 99-year lease of shooting rights by an eccentric old baronet, Denning said that the transaction could not stand \"so as to work the destruction of an estate of which the baronet was morally only a life tenant\". Bridge (with Lord Justice Lawton) vehemently disagreed: \"I know of no principle of law or equity that would entitle the court to condemn this transaction as 'unconscionable' or to interfere on the grounds that the baronet was 'morally only a life tenant'. He was an absolute owner, of sound mind, entitled to dispose of his property as he chose.\" In another appeal in 1977, Bridge wrote that what Denning had said in the leading judgment was unacceptable for four reasons, all of which Bridge spelt out unambiguously. The most important concerned that part of Denning's judgment which decided against the plaintiff on a ground on which counsel for the plaintiff had not been heard. Given the opportunity which came to him in the 1980s in the Lords, Bridge exhibited, in company with Lord Scarman, real concern for civil liberties. In a leading asylum case he heavily underlined the need for the courts to take very special care in evaluating the evidence to establish the fear of inhuman treatment in the asylum seeker's homeland. In the allied field of immigration, Bridge similarly displayed a positive feeling for the immigrant. \u00b7 Nigel Cyprian Bridge, Lord Bridge of Harwich, lawyer, born February 26 1917; died November 20 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
