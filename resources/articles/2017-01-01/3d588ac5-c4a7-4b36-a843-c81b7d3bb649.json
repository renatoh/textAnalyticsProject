The England prop Dan Cole admits the club have a range of troubles to address and says last Saturday\u2019s 43-0 record home defeat by Glasgow ranked among the worst days of his career. With Leicester also announcing on Tuesday that Ed Slater, the club captain last season, has been suspended for two weeks following an internal disciplinary hearing into an incident during the Glasgow game, Cole acknowledges the team\u2019s descent is proving a \u201cpainful\u201d experience. \u201cThe club has been through them before but in my 10 years at Leicester it\u2019s never been as bad as this,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe came up against a very good Glasgow side but it shouldn\u2019t have been 43-0. It was probably one of the worst defeats in the club\u2019s history and, unfortunately, it\u2019s not out of the blue.\u201d Cole, in Portugal with the national squad preparing for the Six Nations, fears there is no quick fix after the departure this month of Richard Cockerill as director of rugby. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a recruitment thing. When you lose 43-0 it\u2019s more than one thing that is the problem. Whether that is recruitment, coaching or individuals \u2026 I think it is a combination of everything. I don\u2019t think anyone thought getting rid of Cockers would instantly turn everything around and make everything hunky dory. That\u2019s been proven. Since being in Premiership finals, the past couple of years we\u2019ve faded away. \u201cThis year\u2019s probably a cumulation of some things but hopefully, at some point, it might be the kick up the arse we need to rejig and play to our potential. If you look at the squad we\u2019ve got it\u2019s a very good one. We should be better than we are.\u201d The 29-year-old Cole, who has 18 months left on his contract, insisted the club will rise again. \u201cThe core of the group, the coaches, the board, the fans, the players, won\u2019t accept being mediocre. You want to be pushing and winning things, especially as I\u2019m nearer the end of my career than the beginning. The fan base will not accept us being average. We have a proud history to live up to. \u201cThe worst thing would be for us to be complacent, [finish] fifth or sixth and be happy with where we are. I\u2019m pretty sure there are clubs out there who are like that but at Leicester our aspirations are higher. It is painful now but we have aspirations to win things. We might have been cruising on the back of what has happened in the past, whereas now we can\u2019t do that anymore. We have to focus on the future.\u201d Having seen England\u2019s fortunes revived by Eddie Jones, Cole believes both local and overseas coaches are Leicester\u2019s best solution. \u201cWe were probably at our best when we had a Cockers or Deano, supplemented by a Matt O\u2019Connor or Aaron Mauger, someone who gets more out of us than just traditional Leicester ways. \u201cThere are some very good things at the club you just don\u2019t throw away but the club works best when you have a marriage of the outside with the inside. This season, we\u2019ve been poor away from home but that defeat probably shows it\u2019s not just a home-away thing, it\u2019s a club thing. We have to get to the bottom of it now.\u201d Slater will miss the Tigers\u2019 next two Anglo-Welsh Cup games, against Northampton and Saracens, after the club decided to impose their own punishment following a citing charge against the lock forward for striking a Glasgow opponent in the first half. Leicester said Slater had expressed regret for his actions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
