This, in a nutshell, is the premise of the rapper's second album in a year. There is only one direct reference, which comes on the title track (\"Terrorism, motherfuckers bombing New York\"), but a skittish paranoia informs key songs such as Call the Ambulance and the melancholy What Do You Do When You're Branded?, featuring a male choir. If it sounds like grim fare - especially spread over nearly 75 minutes - take heart. As ever, Rhymes's attentions are divided between dire apocaplyptic predictions and an irrepressible need to play the fool, and he has included the usual complement of tongue-in-cheek japery. Especially hilarious is the graceless chat-up line on Hey, Ladies: \"Hey, ladies...my Mercedes!\" One of those ladies, Mariah Carey, is an incongruous but creditable guest on I Know What You Want, and Rhymes's Flipmode Squad make their inevitable appearance. So it's Bustaness as usual, and the spectacle of him in full rasping flow (check him out in ragga mode on the untitled bonus track) is still something to behold."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
