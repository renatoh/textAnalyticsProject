Police found in her bedroom a pot of Vaseline, a hot water bottle, a stuffed koala, a roll of Sellotape and a child's snow globe. It wasn't much to show for 44 years. But these scattered items were the only clues to her identity. Her body had lain undiscovered for almost 12 months until the gas company forced the door to her upstairs flat in Hulme, Manchester, in July 2007. The corpse was so decomposed that an inquest could not determine the cause of death. No living relatives could be traced. No mourners attended her funeral. There are a growing number of people like Sandra; modern-day Eleanor Rigbys who die with no friends or family to notice. Some have mental health problems and find themselves detached from the world. Some are elderly and have outlived their families. Sometimes there is no explanation: they have simply sunk without trace. Around 200 funerals a month are unattended, a figure set to rise as it is estimated that, by 2010, 16 million people in the UK will live on their own. Where no relatives can be traced, the local authority pays for a basic cremation. Often the deceased's ashes are disposed of in unmarked graves. Their stories remain untold. But Sandra's story is to be revealed in a Channel 4 documentary this week that seeks to piece together the fragile archaeology of these lost lives. Watch Me Disappear, directed by 27-year-old Lucy Cohen, also looks at the death of Akinyemi Akinpelu, a Nigerian student. He, too, was buried with no one to mourn him. Over five months, Cohen painstakingly studied police photographs and coroners' reports, eventually tracking down friends and family to build up a picture of these two people. Both lived in Greater Manchester and they are buried in the same cemetery. 'Originally, I wondered whether it would be possible for a person to know no one in this day and age,' said Cohen, whose directorial debut is being screened as part of Channel 4's First Cut season to showcase new talent. 'With Facebook and social networks, we are so over-connected it sometimes seems that we can have too many friends. But Sandra and Aki did cut themselves off and that seems to be something about the way we live now. In the old days, you would know someone had died because the milk bottles would pile up on the doorstep. Now, with so much more online shopping, we seem to be cutting down the need for human contact.' Sandra was born two miles from the flat where she died. At the time of her death, she was living on a council estate of 700 residents, yet in the five years before her body was discovered her neighbours hardly noticed her. Because her rent was automatically deducted from her benefits, the bills continued to be paid and no suspicions were raised until almost a year after she died. What happened? Cohen found that Sandra's mother, Gloria, had died when she was 20. Following her father's death in 1997, she was rehoused by social services. Her sister, Sonia, had tried to make contact but failed because of strict data protection rules: Sandra, who suffered from schizophrenia for much of her adult life, had requested that no information be released. According to her friends, she was a big-hearted, gentle girl who had a good start in life. A childhood neighbour, Lorna Jones, remembered the Drummond family home as 'the posh house in the street; the garden was always immaculate'. Sandra's sister recalled her love of the detective series Starsky and Hutch, her penchant for hats and for watching tennis on TV. She was fastidious about her appearance. Aliyah Suleman, a classmate from Whalley Range girls' school, said she insisted on having 'two plaits in her hair. She was always nicely dressed'. Kay, another school friend who did not want to give her surname, said: 'She was very big, very protective. When other people were nasty to me and stayed away from me, she was there. That poor girl, she should have had hopes, she should have had somebody to give her a hug.' In life Sandra had been a protector of others. Yet when she became vulnerable herself, there was no one to help her. Akinyemi Akinpelu, too, slipped between the cracks. In July 2005, he was found dead in his council flat in Wythenshawe by a group of boys playing football. His body had been there for 10 weeks. When the police came, there were no sheets on his bed and his clothes were in suitcases on the floor. He was 34 and had been living in Manchester for less than three years. Akinyemi had come to the UK from Nigeria in 1995 to take a master's degree in ocean engineering at University College London. Femi Adeyemi, who was on the same course, said that he had ambitions to return to his village to set up his own engineering company. 'He told me that when he came, he had \u00a310,000 cash in his suitcase ... That was the money his father gave him from Nigeria.' But \u00a310,000 was not enough to meet his living costs and tuition fees. Akinyemi dropped out, later enrolling on similar courses at Aberdeen and Glasgow universities and, finally, at Manchester, where he was given an outstanding grade for his dissertation. Each time, he was unable to cover the costs required to complete his degree. There was a stack of letters from debt collectors in his flat. His passport records showed that he was allowed to stay in the UK only until 2002. At the time of his death, Akinyemi was liable for deportation. Deliberately, perhaps, he faded from view. His last known human contact was a trip to the Co-op on 1 May 2005 to buy four cans of mushy peas and two litres of milk. He never made it back to Nigeria. Sandra and Akinyemi were comparatively young to die in such lonely circumstances. It is more usual for elderly people such as Olive Archer, who died aged 83, with no known surviving relatives, in a nursing home in Swindon, Wiltshire, last December. The local interfaith minister, the Rev Akasha Lonsdale, issued an appeal through the local newspaper and managed to track down her nieces and nephews who attended her funeral. 'Dying alone is a modern phenomenon because there is a lack of extended family,' said Lonsdale. 'In Olive's case, she never had children and there was a suggestion that she turned down marriage to an RAF officer because she was looking after her elderly parents. Everybody has a story to tell and I think Olive's touched people around the world because they thought \"that could be me\".' Cohen now intends to trace Akinyemi's family in Nigeria. 'I had a responsibility to do Aki and Sandra justice. It didn't feel like a small undertaking. It was impossible to tell everything: I just touched the edges of their character.' \u00b7 'First Cut: Watch Me Disappear' will be shown on Friday at 7.35pm on Channel 4"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
