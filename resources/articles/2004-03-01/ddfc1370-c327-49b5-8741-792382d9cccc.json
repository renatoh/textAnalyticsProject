Adams faces the possibility of being without the services of Paul Dickov, Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie for a period after the trio were charged and detained by police investigating sexual assault claims. The absence of three of his most experienced players will further decimate his already limited resources as Leicester's campaign enters the final two months of the season. Adams was already reported to be distraught at events in La Manga after three German women complained to police of the behaviour of a group of City players. But it will be a massive setback to him as the serious nature of the charges against the trio means they will not be returning to England for now. Ginetta is keeping his fingers crossed that it will not prove to be the final straw for Adams. \"This will be a massive blow to Micky. After the recent game at Middlesbrough, where we lost a two goal lead in injury-time, he looked stressed and this will not help matters for him. \"The guy has already been working with his hands tied behind his back and we desperately need him to stay at Leicester City. \"He is the cornerstone of the revival at the club after being relegated two years ago. I don't see him quitting but there again you wonder how much can a man take? How often do you have to keep being hit by bricks before they hurt.\" Ginetta believes the absence of Dickov will be \"a massive loss\" after his contribution over the past 18 months. Dickov scored 20 goals in the promotion season and has netted 10 this campaign, working effectively with Marcus Bent and Les Ferdinand. Ginetta said: \"If he is not available, it will leave Micky and Leicester with an even bigger mountain to climb. \"Paul is the one who gets the fans going. They love him to bits with his aggression and commitment and he also scores his fair share of goals.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
