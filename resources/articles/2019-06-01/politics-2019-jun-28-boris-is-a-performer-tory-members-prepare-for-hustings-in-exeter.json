Resplendent in a Royal British Legion jacket, Norman, 75, took his place at the Sandy Park conference centre neutral but thinking Johnson was probably his man. He left feeling differently. \u201cI\u2019m going to support Jeremy Hunt,\u201d said Norman, who is from east Devon. \u201cHe\u2019s a much more thoughtful guy and I believe that will be better for the country. I\u2019m glad I came.\u201d At the other end of the age scale, Hunt also managed to woo 17-year-old students Alex Hall and Alecia Mason, from Torbay. \u201cI was leaning towards Boris at the start,\u201d said Hall. \u201cBut I was taking notes and found myself writing less when it was Jeremy Hunt\u2019s turn because I was fixated on what he was saying. Boris has the personality but Hunt seems more about getting on with the job.\u201d Mason agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t think Johnson is willing to change,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Jeremy will sculpt his views and compromise.\u201d It was striking how many people entering the conference centre next to Exeter Chiefs\u2019 rugby pitch on Friday were wearing badges supporting both candidates. Jo McCready, a 48-year-old IT worker from Bristol, was also undecided on the way in. As she left she said: \u201cI think I\u2019m leaning towards Jeremy. He seems more grounded; he does have a Brexit plan \u2013 bringing factions of the Conservatives together and the DUP. You don\u2019t hear that from Boris, I don\u2019t know what Boris\u2019s plan is. Jeremy has fact and detail.\u201d The men did not go head-to-head but addressed the room and took questions separately. Johnson went first and reminded people that he had been raised on a Devon farm. Revelations were few and when asked to tell the audience something they didn\u2019t know about him, Johnson said he weighed 15 and a half stone. Questioned over what failings he had learned from when a minister, he said he had been mistaken to think he could forge better relations with Russia. One member asked if he was too \u201cfrit\u201d to take on Hunt in more television debates. He said two was \u201cmore than enough\u201d. He would not commit to including Hunt in a future cabinet if he won. Hunt, when his turn came, told the audience he had lived in Devon for two years when his naval officer father was posted there but accepted he was a \u201cgrockle\u201d - local slang for holidaymakers and other incomers. Asked whether character mattered \u2013 an invitation to criticise Johnson\u2019s \u2013 he replied: \u201cOf course character matters,\u201d but he said private life should not be part of that. Hunt said there should be further head-to-head debates before Tory party members receive their ballot papers this time next week. Hunt said many would vote by return \u2013 that was what Tories did \u2013 before the next TV head-to-head. On which failing he had learned from, he cited the junior doctors\u2019 strike when he was health secretary. Unlike Johnson, Hunt said he would love to have his opponent in his cabinet, and he gave a strong hint that if he lost he would be keen to remain foreign secretary. The standing ovation at the end of Hunt\u2019s half of the hustings was slightly larger than Johnson\u2019s \u2013 though that might have been because he went second and people were anxious to stretch their legs. Hunt clearly made new friends in Exeter, and in Bournemouth the night before, but the Johnson loyalists were still confident. Gavin Donovan, who lives in a village just outside Exeter and works in property, said his mind had not been changed. \u201cI thought Boris was particularly great \u2013 energetic and fired up and ready to take on the mantle. There are no reservations about his character for me. I love his positivity.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
