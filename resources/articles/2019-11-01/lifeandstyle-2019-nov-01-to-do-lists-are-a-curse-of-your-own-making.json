It\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve heard someone mention the evil eye. I grew up with the folklore but have always rejected superstition. \u201cBit much, no?\u201d I mentioned to Mum, later. \u201cMe, describing a bad yet ordinary week, and her saying, \u2018Oh you must be cursed, love.\u2019\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry,\u201d Mum replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a compliment.\u201d That\u2019s because the evil eye is a malevolent glare cast at those with something beautiful, hard-won and excellent; their longing manifesting as a destructive curse. (As superstitions go, this must rank as one of the nicest. \u201cHey, has something gone wrong? That\u2019s because you\u2019re great.\u201d) After the salon came more bad news, more curveballs, and an accelerating to-do list. I was failing in my numerous roles \u2013 as love project manager, friend cheerleader, health aficionado. So when I found myself in A&amp;E with a torn shoulder tendon and a doctor\u2019s note telling me to stop everything at once, I felt relief. I had an excuse to step back. No one asks me to do half the things on my list. My boyfriend does not ask me to plan every dinner. No one tells me to exercise. Mum couldn\u2019t have asked me to set up a smart heating system for her, when she doesn\u2019t know what it is. So why do we do it? Perhaps we \u2013 women, especially \u2013 think we should. Or maybe the curse is a manifestation of fear, of knowing what is beautiful, hard-won and excellent in our lives, and that it can be easily lost. Perhaps my beautician was right. An evil eye did look at me, but it was my own eye all along."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
