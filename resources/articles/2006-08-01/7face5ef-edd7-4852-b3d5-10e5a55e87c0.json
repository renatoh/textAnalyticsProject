Bob Dylan", "bodyText": "Old singer-songwriters never die - they just leave longer gaps between albums. That's the way it seems for Bob Dylan, who this week releases Modern Times, his first album for five years (the previous one, Love And Theft, had the misfortune to be released in the US on September 11 2001). The critics have received Modern Times warmly, not that Dylan has ever cared much for critics. And after releasing 50 albums - the first was the self-titled Bob Dylan, released in March 1962 - he probably cares even less. With more than 40 years in the business Dylan has been in and out of fashion so many times that now he, like the Rolling Stones, floats above the music industry and its whims. In recent years Dylan has shed some of his famous reclusiveness, which at one time led him to coin such gnomic utterances as \"If I wasn't Bob Dylan, I'd probably think that Bob Dylan has a lot of answers.\" He even has a weekly radio show, the Theme Time Radio Hour, which can be heard over the internet, and still maintains his gruelling schedule of live performances, which remain idiosyncratic and unstructured. The big question with Dylan is always, will the latest album be as good as Blood On The Tracks? The 1975 album was his last work of great acclaim. The answer is inevitably \"No\", because nothing could replicate Dylan's burst of creativity in his 20s and 30s. But then again, with Bob anything is possible, which is why his fans live in hope."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
