The striker remains a Ranger, until January at least when, Ferdinand says, \u201cIt will all start again\u201d. Then, there was the fiasco over Sandro\u2019s work permit, which led to the midfielder being forced out of the country; the negotiations over the club\u2019s financial fair play penalty and a couple of moves at boardroom level, with Lee Hoos coming in as chief executive and Ruben Gnanalingam assuming the role of co-chairman alongside Tony Fernandes. Above all, though, Ferdinand has had to drive home changes to the very culture of the club. QPR\u2019s image in recent years has been coloured by bad eggs in the dressing room; players who have done little but collect their inflated salaries and executives that have been foolish enough to pay them. It has been up to Ferdinand to plot a path towards a calmer and more prudent future. The 48-year-old smiles. He has bounced into the training ground canteen for this interview and he looks in great shape. He is wearing his training kit because he is a director of football with the emphasis on football. He tries to be pitch-side at Harlington as much as possible to watch the manager Chris Ramsey\u2019s sessions. \u201cA couple of people have said, \u2018All you do is come in and sit behind your desk, and you don\u2019t do much until the transfer window happens,\u2019\u201d Ferdinand says. And how might he respond to those folk? \u201cI say that I find that not to be the case,\u201d he replies. Ferdinand has been swimming with the sharks \u2013 the agents, fixers and middle-men, not to mention the directors at rival clubs, who make the transfer roundabout spin. They are the creatures who Fernandes said \u2013 in May 2013, after his first relegation from the Premier League \u2013 \u201cWould sell their grandmother to do something.\u201d Ferdinand is a gentleman, a knight of the west London realm but, happily, he is not the sort to be pushed around. \u201cThe most interesting part was dealing with the agents,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cFor a few years, they\u2019ve been used to dealing with executives at this club but they\u2019re now dealing with someone who knows a little bit about football. In fact, I like to think I know quite a lot about football. I say: \u2018Don\u2019t try and sell players to me. Tell me who you\u2019ve got and I\u2019ll tell you whether they fit into my team or not. You\u2019re not going to tell me that.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ve sat down with agents and, because of what\u2019s happened at the club, they have come up with certain figures for their players. It\u2019s what players have earned here in the past and they are going on past reputations. I understand it. If I was sitting in their shoes, I\u2019d do exactly the same. But when they realise where I\u2019m at and where the club\u2019s at, they go, \u2018OK. Well, we had to try it.\u2019 They admit it in the end.\u201d Ferdinand has had to slash the wage bill following QPR\u2019s relegation back into the Championship and some of the high earners were shipped out, although others proved more difficult to shift \u2013 such as Junior Hoilett, Armand Traor\u00e9 and Samba Diakit\u00e9. After all his tribulations, Sandro and his \u00a350,000 weekly wage also remain at the club. Of the new signings, seven were taken on free transfers or loans and the remainder cost about \u00a38.5m in fees. None have a contract of longer than three years and none are on massive salaries. \u201cThat is fair to say,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cNot in comparison to what it was. \u201cUnfortunately, a few players have come here in the past for the wrong reasons. They\u2019ve thought, \u2018I\u2019m not far off retiring, and I can earn good money for a year or two at QPR.\u2019 That\u2019s the mindset we\u2019ve had to change. I want people who are in the midst of their careers, and who are pushing on. \u201cI went to school around the corner from Loftus Road and I went past QPR every single day of my school life, so I understand what it means to people in the area. These supporters come week in, week out and they just want to see an honest bunch of boys going out there earning their living. That\u2019s all I want to see people do.\u201d Ferdinand is a persuasive front man for the new QPR and he is helped by his status as one of the club\u2019s playing legends. It also reinforces his sales pitch to prospective new signings. He played for England. He scored loads of great goals. He is Sir Les. It matters. Ferdinand is a trailblazer, too, in the quest to break down racial barriers in the English game. Apart from Michael Emenalo at Chelsea, Ferdinand cannot think of any other black people who have been entrusted with technical director or director of football positions and the dearth of black managers is similarly vexing. \u201cPremier League clubs normally know the manager they want before they sack the one they\u2019ve got,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cAnd if you\u2019ve never been on the ladder, you\u2019re never going to get the opportunity.\u201d Ferdinand is a supporter of the Rooney Rule, which was conceived in American Football and requires NFL teams to interview at least one black or ethnic minority candidate for head coaching and senior football operation jobs. He believes it might be the only way to unlock what looks to be a closed shop. \u201cIt gives us an opportunity to get through the door,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re not even getting that opportunity. Until you make it compulsory, we will be talking about this in another 10 years\u2019 time. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that I have been given my job by an Asian chairman [Fernandes], rather than perhaps an Englishman. I sit in directors\u2019 boxes every week now and what I do know is that all the owners of football clubs and all the people who sit in directors\u2019 boxes \u2026 associate directors, directors of the club or the opposition, or friends \u2026 there are not many black people, if any. That tells you what you need to know.\u201d Ferdinand talks of Fernandes\u2019s enthusiasm and his commitment to QPR, not only for the next year or two but \u201c10 and 20 years down the line\u201d. The vision is to rebuild from the bottom up, so when they are ready to win promotion into the Premier League again, they are equipped to stay there. Youth development is a key part of Ferdinand\u2019s philosophy and he accepts he has to energise the club\u2019s academy. \u201cIt\u2019s 16 years since a player has come through the system and played on a regular basis for the first-team \u2013 that was Richard Langley,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cFor a club like QPR, with the catchment area we are in, that saddens me, it really does. We have to build that academy up. If you\u2019ve been working there for a long time and seen no one come through, they\u2019re just coming into work. They\u2019re not enthusiastic and I understand why. I need to enthuse them. \u201cRaheem Sterling is the prime example of what there is out there. He came out of a council estate in Wembley, he was here for a while and look at what he went on to be. There has to be more of them and we have just got to go searching. We have to be better.\u201d Fernandes has taken some big hits during his four years at Loftus Road, chiefly the relegations but also the FFP breach, which relates to the club\u2019s overspend in 2013-14 when they were previously in the Championship. Hoos, rather than Ferdinand, has handled the discussions with the Football League and the club expect to be docked around \u00a38m. The Sandro affair was a dreadful cock-up. \u201cThere\u2019s no other word for it, really,\u201d Ferdinand says. The club forgot to update the Brazilian\u2019s residency paperwork and when the Home Office discovered the blunder last May, Sandro was not allowed to play in the final three games of the season, as QPR went down. \u201cWould he have made the difference? Who knows?\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cYou\u2019d like to think so. We\u2019ve learned a lesson and it will never happen again. We move on. Sandro is back now and he\u2019s raring to go.\u201d Austin, too, has refocused after a difficult summer when he was expected to leave only for none of the interested Premier League clubs to meet QPR\u2019s \u00a315m asking price. To add to the insult, the West Ham United co-chairman, David Sullivan, suggested that his club had not moved for Austin because of concerns over the state of the player\u2019s knee. Austin has one year to run on his contract. \u201cFor someone in Sullivan\u2019s position to come out like that \u2026 to go into details and not get the details right \u2026 it was a little bit disappointing and a little bit disrespectful,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cThe whole thing did affect Charlie. I\u2019ve been in that predicament as a player and as much as you want to be the right citizen and get your head just around playing football, it\u2019s going to affect you. When I was at QPR, I was going to Liverpool, Man Utd, Tottenham, Arsenal, and there was a lot to each of those links. That will affect you. But Charlie has done his level best to get on with the job.\u201d So has Ferdinand, and it is a little crazy to think that he has been in the job for under a year. He prepared for it by taking courses in applied management at Warwick Business School and governance at St George\u2019s Park, although he says he continues to learn on it, particularly the financial side. When Ferdinand joined QPR last October, it was initially as the club\u2019s head of football operations. \u201cIt\u2019s a stupid title really, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry Redknapp, the manager at the time, said. \u201cI went to see Harry about that,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cI said, \u2018What was the reason for calling it a silly title?\u2019 He said, \u2018It\u2019s not one we\u2019ve heard before.\u2019 I said, \u2018No, but what was the reason for calling it that when you were comfortable with me coming in? I took this job because you were comfortable with me coming in. I wouldn\u2019t have taken it otherwise. You called me. So to now call it a silly title \u2026\u2019 \u201cI suppose managers get a bit paranoid. But this wasn\u2019t done without Harry knowing. I spoke to the owners and made sure Harry was happy with me coming in. I wasn\u2019t here to take Harry\u2019s job or tell Harry what to do. I was here and I am here to help the owners get this football club back to where it wants to be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
