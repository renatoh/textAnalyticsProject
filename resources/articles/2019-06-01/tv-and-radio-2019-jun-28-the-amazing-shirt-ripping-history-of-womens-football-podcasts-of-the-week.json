Prosecutor Doug Evans, who has previously tried Flowers on six occasions for the same crime, had shown a \u201crelentless, determined effort to rid the jury of black individuals\u201d, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote. Sacked BBC DJ Danny Baker has announced that he will relaunch his axed Radio 5 show as a podcast. Baker, who left the BBC following a tweet that depicted the royal baby as a chimpanzee, said that the show would feature \u201csubjects bizarre\u201d and begin in the new year. Picks of the week The Next Episode This \u201cJon Ronson for millennials\u201d pod is hosted by BBC journalists Linda Adey and Ben Zand, and kicked off last month with an episode on the sex abuse allegations against R Kelly \u2013 a topic Zand previously explored in a searing BBC Three doc. So far, its bite-sized instalments have focused on everything from being blackmailed on the dark web, to the rise of pornographic deepfakes, to #MeToo in music, recently breaking the disturbing story of an alleged assault on AlunaGeorge singer Aluna Francis. Hannah J Davies The Thread This innovative podcast links historical moments, previously racing through the events leading up to #MeToo and examining Martin Luther King\u2019s nonviolence movement. Now it\u2019s the turn of women\u2019s football, starting in 1999 with the US team\u2019s World Cup victory when Brandi Chastain ripped her shirt off for a victory celebration. Going back to the 70s, women playing at Yale didn\u2019t even get showers so they stripped in protest to secure their post-match rights. It is a timely reminder of how far women\u2019s football has come. Hannah Verdier Guardian Pick: Books podcast Podcast producers will tell you that one of our favourite things to do is find connections that others might not. This week\u2019s Books podcast \u2013 which draws parallels between two seemingly disconnected stories \u2013 is an excellent testament to that. The first half of the show features the infectiously buoyant Bernardine Evaristo, who details her polyphonic novel of black womanhood, Girl, Woman, Other. And in the second, we hear about a shockingly intimate study of a single \u201chonour\u201d killing, as seen by both survivor and perpetrator. Max Sanderson Producer pick: Tailenders Chosen by Ekaterina Ochagavia (video producer) The Cricket World Cup is in full swing and it turns out the Guardian\u2019s own cricket podcast \u2013 The Spin \u2013 isn\u2019t the only one out there ... Tailenders is an effervescent podcast that loosely aims to demystify the sometimes ridiculous world of cricket. And despite being someone with close to zero understanding of how cricket works, I\u2019m hooked! The podcast-come-live show on BBC Radio 5 Live is a silly, joyful and inclusive introduction to cricket with BBC Radio 1 host Greg James, England\u2019s \u201cgreatest ever fast bowler\u201d Jimmy Anderson and Felix White of The Maccabees as the hosts. Peppered with musical interludes by White, who \u2013 full disclosure \u2013 I know from school, the show is a delightful mishmash of banter, music, cricket history and even a bit of actual analysis. My favourite segment is \u201cgeneral cricketing sadness\u201d, where the presenters\u2019 use their own love-hate relationship with a game that is \u201cbooby trapped for constant humiliation\u201d to help listeners come to peace with cricket woes past and present. Keep your eyes peeled for Project Mobilisation, too; their attempt to get a banner into every game of the Cricket World Cup and Ashes #tailendersoftheworlduniteandtakeover."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
