Military historians prefer to imagine orders that didn't go astray, snipers who kept their nerve or codes that were never cracked, but in this collection of essays their counterfactual projections are just as sweeping - monotheism and democracy are crushed at birth, the Mongols conquer Europe, the Armada triumphs, the American revolution stalls, Lincoln is forced to recognise the South, Lenin and Stalin remain nonentities because the 1914 war is over by Christmas, and Hitler successfully thrusts through the Middle East rather than following Napoleon to defeat in Russia. Extra Virgin Annie Hawes (Penguin, \u00a36.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL Like many another sun-dried holiday read, Extra Virgin owes its existence to the surprise commercial success of books such as A Year in Provence , Under the Tuscan Sun and Driving Over Lemons - all travel books written by expatriate residents rather than roving humorists. But the story of Hawes's gradual assimilation into the Ligurian village where she buys a cottage and olive grove is written with too much vivacity and observational acuity to be dismissed as just a me-too Mediterranean memoir. And her affectionate anthropology avoids the pitfalls of Peter Mayle's work, refusing to reduce her Italian neighbours to comic turns. John Dugdale Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination Gerald M Edelman and Giulio Tononi (Penguin, \u00a38.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL So here's another of those annoying subtitles that disingenuously claim a scientific problem has now been solved. Of course it hasn't, but this is still a sharp read on the problem of how physical stuff can think. The authors wisely insist that the brain is not a computer, and that consciousness is a process rather than a metaphysical object. But they often lapse into uncritical determinism, and for a book apparently pitched at the pop-science market it is dense with rebarbative diagrams and equations. It's less an overview of current research than a manifesto for the authors' own hypothesis. Jasper Milvain"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
