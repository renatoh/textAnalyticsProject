Other sports, too", "bodyText": "Margaret Court is right, tennis is full of lesbians. So is AFLW, soccer, cricket, you name any women\u2019s sport and the same (mostly) applies. It\u2019s an open secret that anyone who has played these sports or has momentarily observed them is aware of. And it\u2019s not a fact to be ashamed of. It goes without saying that women who play male-dominated, traditionally \u201cmasculine\u201d sports, particularly at an elite level, have defied a whole range of stereotypes about gender to make it to where they are. It follows, I would argue, that some of these same women might question the presumption of the righteousness of heterosexuality at the heart of Margaret Court\u2019s worldview. Gender normativity \u2013 or the belief in restrictive gender norms \u2013 and compulsory heterosexuality go hand in hand: to be assigned female at birth is to identify as a woman, is to be feminine, is to be attracted to men, who identify as male, who are masculine. Or is it not? Disrupting this ideological logic is exactly what those who agree with Court are afraid of. Indeed, if you listen closely to Court\u2019s rambling radio interview, she is most disturbed by the idea that girls and boys in today\u2019s society might be encouraged to explore their gender identity beyond the realm of hegemonic masculinity and femininity. Court, for example, outlines her own history as a \u201ctomboy\u201d in childhood: \u201cI could kick the ball better than anyone, could play cricket \u2026 but I always knew I was a girl. I liked wearing shorts, but I liked wearing dresses. But with the literature, the bullying, the stuff that\u2019s put out today into children\u2019s minds \u2026 if you haven\u2019t got parents who bring you up that way, [or] you\u2019ve got parents who just don\u2019t care \u2026 a child can start to think, maybe I\u2019m a girl when they\u2019re a boy, or maybe I\u2019m a boy when they\u2019re a girl.\u201d In other words, Court being a tomboy was OK on account of the fact that she remained certain of her core \u201cnature\u201d as a woman. For her, this is symbolised by her desire to wear dresses as well as shorts \u2013 or the fact that she was feminine even though she had a \u201cmasculine\u201d prowess for sport. But, she fears, with anti-bullying programs such as Safe Schools (singled out for condemnation as the work of the \u201cdevil\u201d), children may no longer be so assured of their \u201crightful\u201d gender identities \u2013 and by extension, their sexualities. This is why transgender kids are targeted for her ire, as is Casey Dellacqua, an Australian tennis player with a female partner who has two children. In raising her children without a father, Dellacqua was accused by Court of \u201cdepriving\u201d her children. Such logic ignores the fact that men are not always good fathers, and that queer parents are some of the most loving in the world. If you want facts, children in same-sex parented Australian families do as well emotionally, socially, educationally as their peers from heterosexual families. But this is not about facts, this is about ideology. Ironically, the impetus behind the Safe Schools program is to provide support for those students whose gendered or sexual expression is often the target of bullying. In their own resources, the Safe Schools Coalition notes that school is the place where most homophobic and transphobic bullying takes place. Seventy-five percent of LGBTI students have experienced abuse and discrimination, with 80% of the abuse happening in schools. These statistics are similar in sport, where, according to study Out On The Fields, 87% of young gay Australians in team sports feel they have to hide their sexuality on account of the bullying experienced, or anticipated. Just who is bullying who, then, is a question of ideology. On Thursday, Martina Navratilova rightly argued Court\u2019s \u201cvitriol is not just an opinion \u2026 kids will suffer more because of this continuous bashing and stigmatising of our LGBT community.\u201d As a result, Navratilova\u2019s open letter concluded with the call for Court\u2019s Arena to be renamed Evonne Goolagong Arena. \u201c[That] has a great ring to it. Now there is a person we can all celebrate. On every level.\u201d On-court hero though she may have been, Court\u2019s worldview is far out of step with those people \u2013 both in sport and more broadly \u2013 whose lives are lived in defiance of the restrictive norms about gender and sexuality that her views propagate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
