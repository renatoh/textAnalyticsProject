Hussain and the England coach Duncan Fletcher have been furious with the facilities provided by the Indian board at the Calcutta Cricket and Football Club, which England claim were dangerous and limited the practice available to both batsmen and bowlers. Since their arrival they have lobbied the Indian board to allow them access to Eden Gardens, the venue for Saturday's opening one-day international, but have so far been limited to yesterday's session under lights because ground authorities claimed they need to prepare the ground for the match. That prompted Hussain, who has tried to remain diplomatic, to accuse the Indians of being unprofessional. \"It's not just frustrating, it's just not good enough,\" he said. \"You wouldn't ask Manchester United to train at a club ground; it just wouldn't happen. The club themselves have been very accommodating towards us but it's just not professional and it's not treating an international side with the respect they deserve.\" The continuing row over practice facilities followed a chaotic visit to a Calcutta orphanage yesterday. What was supposed to be a low-key visit by Hussain and five other players became a media stampede with nearly 100 Indian journalists. \"We tried to keep it low key but trying to do that out here is nearly impossible,\" said Hussain. \"It was a bit of a shame because we came out here to see the children and for them to see us but it's important we do things like this and get out and see these things.\" The Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan yesterday reached 400 Test wickets in record time as Sri Lanka completed a series whitewash of Zimbabwe in Galle. He achieved the feat in 72 Tests, eight fewer than Richard Hadlee of New Zealand. The tourists were dismissed for only 79 as they slumped to defeat by 315 runs in the third Test. Muralitharan recorded match figures of nine for 91 and reached the milestone when he bowled Henry Olonga to end Zimbabwe's first innings. \"It's a great moment in my career,\" he said. \"The main thing in my mind now is to take 500 wickets but, if I remain fit and keep performing well, then I can continue for another five years and could then get 600.\" In Hobart an innings of 97 by Gary Kirsten inspired South Africa to a 26-run victory over New Zealand in the third one-day international of the VB series. The Kiwis fell short of their target of 258 despite a battling 86 from their captain Stephen Fleming. England's Caroline Atkins and Arran Thompson set a women's Test record for an opening stand when they put on 200 against India in Lucknow. Atkins was run out 10 short of her century and Thompson was bowled for 85. England made 314 all out and India were 21 for no wicket. - PA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
