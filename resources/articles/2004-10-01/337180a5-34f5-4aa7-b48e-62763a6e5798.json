The Southampton chairman is asked how he is by the caller. \"I'm fine,\" he says. \"I'm getting a bit of flak as usual but you know ...\" Criticism has become a way of life for Lowe but he exudes a sense of optimism and determination that appears hard to shake. Whether at Southampton or as a Football Association board member Lowe has never been afraid of being bold. Consider his decisions on Gordon Strachan, Glenn Hoddle, Sir Clive Woodward, and now his ideas for FA reform. Each has met with a backlash but Lowe prefers to follow his instincts rather than run for cover. There could be no such option now in any case. With Southampton in the relegation zone and on their eighth manager or head coach in eight years plenty of eyes are on Lowe. He is confident Steve Wigley will keep the team up, points out that Stuart Gray was his only sacking and reflects on the flak. \"I think any criticism is hurtful to a human being,\" he says. \"I would say for every letter of praise I get I probably get 100 of criticism. That is probably a reflection on human nature. \"We've had a few things to praise at this football club. We've moved to a new stadium, funded it, stayed in the Premier League, improved our fortunes on the financial and football side, been to a Cup final. But if you are doing this job you have to understand that the depth of feeling, which in some ways is the strength of the club, does reflect in more negative comment when things are going badly than positive praise when things are going well.\" There has been plenty of negative comment on the subject of Southampton's form. They are 18th in the table going into tomorrow's game at Arsenal, with no goals in four league matches, and yet Lowe has a survivor's outlook. \"We're all confident we'll turn it round,\" he says. \"We've been in tighter corners. Six points from 10 games with three-quarters of the season to play is far from a crisis. The year I joined I think we'd got 27 points from 31 games and were bottom of the table. \"That's when I became chairman, with a stadium that was the smallest in the league. I sit here now and think of all the positives, which I tend to do. I'm happy to be criticised for that. I think this club has a great future if people keep their nerve, keep supporting the way they have.\" In assessing the poor start Lowe points to injuries to James Beattie, Kevin Phillips and Michael Svensson among others. \"If you are being spanked 4-0 or 5-0 every week and you've got few injuries then you start to wonder,\" he says. With Paul Sturrock gone - \"Sometimes if you take from the lower leagues and the cultures don't mix it doesn't work\" - much rests with Wigley. Lowe believes the 43-year-old, who joined the Southampton staff in 2001, offers not just knowledge but continuity after the departures of Dave Jones, Hoddle, Gray, Strachan and Sturrock. \"We've been accused of being everything to Jack the Ripper,\" Lowe says of the turnover of managers. \"But the truth is I've only sacked one manager and that was Stuart Gray. We've always striven for continuity in management but for one reason or another it hasn't happened. \"I think if we give Steve a chance we will get there. We have had too many different people coming in from the outside with different ideas and beliefs. Steve is understanding of what the club is all about, is a great coach and has the full support of the players.\" Lowe rubbishes suggestions that he interferes on the playing side, notably by making signings without the manager's consent. \"I do the contracts - that's my job as chairman. People think the long arm of the chairman is running the club now; the truth is different.\" Lowe explains how Wigley identifies the positions for which he wants players before Terry Cooper, the club's Euro pean scout, and Ray Clarke, the chief UK scout, identify individuals. \"What we don't do is buy players without our head coach being happy,\" he says. Cooper wrote in Wednesday's match programme that Southampton need a creative midfielder and a tall, quick striker waiting to take over \"if Beattie decides to move in January\". Lowe has always been keen to keep Beattie but tends to allow players to go if they wish - for the right price. With a 50% wage cut awaiting the board, staff and players in the event of relegation, Lowe has ensured the club would be as healthy as possible outside the Premiership, though he prefers to contemplate other matters. He hopes the club can ultimately buy fewer players - \"a smaller quantity of the finished product\" - as the academy bears fruit. Among the recent visitors to the set-up was Woodward. \"He comes down occasionally, has a look round and a chat,\" Lowe says. \"He's got the Lions tour to deal with, his own contracts to deal with. But if we can teach him about football and learn about his World Cup-winning success, it's our duty to learn about it.\" Woodward knows all about overcoming criticism to succeed. History suggests Lowe is on the same track.
