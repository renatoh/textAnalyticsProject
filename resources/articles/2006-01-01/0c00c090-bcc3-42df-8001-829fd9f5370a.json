The two-metre high sculpture, one of a set of three statues by Lynn Chadwick, was taken from Roehampton University in south-west London, overnight on January 10. The Art Newspaper reported that the figure had been cut away by its feet from the base of the sculpture, called The Watchers. Detectives said it would have taken at least eight people to move the artwork The theft comes less than a year after the university \"discovered\" The Watchers in the grounds of Downshire House, one of its campus buildings, and considered whether to sell it or move it to make repairs. Notes from the minutes of a finance meeting held in March last year read: \"A valuable piece of art by Lynn Chadwick has been discovered in the grounds of Downshire House. The estimated worth of this piece is \u00a3200k and it would be good to relocate the piece and have it repaired, but there is an opportunity to sell the piece and take a profit.\" A university spokeswoman confirmed that the sculpture referred to was the stolen artwork but refused to comment further on how the bronze piece - which reportedly weighs a third of a tonne - could have been overlooked. According to the Wandsworth Borough Council website, the sculpture was grade two listed in April 1998 and was sited at Roehampton in 1963 by London County Council. The theft comes just weeks after a massive \u00a33m Henry Moore bronze sculpture was taken from the Henry Moore Foundation in Perry Green, Much Hadham, in Hertfordshire. The Metropolitan police said there had been around 20 similar thefts of artworks in and around London in the last six months. Officers fear valuable sculptures worth millions of pounds are being stolen to be melted down and used for scrap metal. Detective Sergeant Vernon Rapley, head of the Metropolitan police's arts and antiques unit, said: \"The people perpetrating these crimes appear to have no appreciation of, or respect for, the objects they are stealing. \"Rewards have been offered for the return of some of the objects and we would encourage anyone with information to come forward and assist us to recover these important objects.\" The artwork stolen from Roehampton this month was one of only three such pieces in the world. The others are kept in Loughborough and Denmark. The Henry Moore sculpture Reclining Figure was taken on December 15 by thieves using a flat-bed lorry with a lifting crane on the back. The sculpture, which was created in 1969-70, was being kept in a farmyard next to the Henry Moore Foundation visitor centre awaiting repositioning. At the time police said the thieves had planned to steal the sculpture and voiced fears they would melt it down for its scrap value of about \u00a35,000. Chief Inspector Richard Harbon said at the time that police classed the sculpture as a \"national treasure\". He added: \"It is a nationally-renowned sculpture and very, very difficult to get rid of. This is not opportunist theft. These are people who knew what they were doing, knew what they were after. A very, very audacious theft.\" Despite widespread publicity about the theft, the artwork has still not been recovered and police investigations are ongoing. Chadwick, who was born in London in 1914, studied drawing, watercolour and oil painting before working as an architectural draughtsman in London from 1933 to 1939. He came to sculpture relatively late, holding his first exhibition in London in 1950, but his reputation grew rapidly. He won the international prize for sculpture at the Venice Biennale in 1956 and was awarded the CBE in 1964. In 1958 the sculptor bought Lypiatt Park, near Stroud in Gloucestershire, where he was buried following his death in April 2003. Information on the Wandsworth Borough Council website concerning the missing Chadwick sculpture's listed status describe it as \"three abstract figures, of menacing and predatory character that sum up Chadwick's fear of 'big brother', an Orwellian theme in tune with popular politics of the time.\" ongoing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
