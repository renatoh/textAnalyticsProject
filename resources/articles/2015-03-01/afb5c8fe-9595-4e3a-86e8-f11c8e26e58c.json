Oh is voiced by Jim Parsons \u2013 the nerdy scientist Sheldon from TV\u2019s The Big Bang Theory. Oh\u2019s dysfunctional, semi-grammatical way of speaking (\u201cThis is not a sustainable friendship model\u201d) is a funny-annoying tic which takes a little time to grow on you. But once it has, Home is an entertaining odd-couple comedy on very traditional lines, and the reason for Oh\u2019s name is funny, too. As the film is in 3D, there is naturally a fair bit of flying through the air \u2013 in a wackily modified small car. This is a likable children\u2019s film, although there is a structural flaw: the Boov are supposed to be so hilariously timid, and yet they colonise Earth with brutal efficiency, moving Earthlings into what look like mass detention camps in Australia. So they can\u2019t be that wussy, and it slightly muddles the joke. There is one unexpectedly sharp moment. Tip says she resents the way the Boov have stolen and subjugated her planet. Indignant Oh says that they merely \u201cliberate and befriend\u201d. Perhaps it\u2019s a satire of western foreign policy in the Middle East."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
