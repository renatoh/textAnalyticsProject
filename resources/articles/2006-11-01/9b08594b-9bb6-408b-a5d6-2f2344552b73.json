At the weekends, I mix: Times, Telegraph and News of the World. Magazines I get all the fashion magazines. I get French, American, Italian and English Vogue - I have this huge wall where I keep them all. Easy Living is quite sweet, and things like Pop magazine. Books I read all the time: one minute The Hobbit and the next a historical novel. I love The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory. I'm enjoying The Fencing Master by Arturo P\u00e9rez-Reverte and The Constant Princess, also by Philippa Gregory. And I've just finished Jimi Hendrix: the Man, the Magic, the Truth by Sharon Lawrence. TV It's only since I got back from living in New York that I've watched much TV. I used to go out a lot but now I work a lot and don't go out. I love Grey's Anatomy, Lost, the Sopranos, CSI and House. I Sky+ them. Radio Radio 4 in the morning, and Radio 1. Ads Unless they're really clever and visually brilliant, I find them irritating - that's why I Sky+ most things. I can't bear the Sheilas' Wheels commercial - they sponsor CSI and it puts me in a fury every time. Guinness does great adverts and the Sony ones are good - I like the one with all the paint. New media I'm a gadget addict - I've got an iPod and the new BlackBerry Pearl. And I went to Hong Kong and got the new little LG phone in pink before it came out here. I love my little gadgets, even though half the time I don't know how to use them. And I am a total internet shopping addict. I got a parcel this morning with a pair of Ugg boots in it. I love it because I buy things and then I forget, so I get parcels like it's Christmas. I get everything online, from work to stationery to clothes to food. \u00b7 Jemma Kidd is the beauty expert at the Eve magazine style show at the Birmingham NEC, Dec 1-6, www.evestyleshow.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
