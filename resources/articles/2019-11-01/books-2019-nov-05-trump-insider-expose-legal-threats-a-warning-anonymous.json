Due out on 19 November, A Warning was written anonymously by the senior official who wrote the opinion piece I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration for the New York Times last year. Publisher Little, Brown, a subsidiary of the Hachette Group, said the book picks up \u201cfrom where those first words of warning left off\u201d. According to a letter obtained by CNN, the DoJ has told the author\u2019s publishers and agent that \u201cif the author is, in fact, a current or former \u2018senior official\u2019 in the Trump administration\u201d, publication could violate routine agreements about information obtained while working for the US government. Assistant attorney general Joseph H Hunt said: \u201cSuch agreements typically require that any written work potentially containing protected information be submitted for pre-publication review.\u201d Hachette\u2019s lawyer Carol Ross has responded, according to CNN, saying that it intends to go ahead with publication of the \u201cimportant book\u201d and that it is not party to any non-disclosure agreements with the US government that would require any pre-publication review. \u201cHachette has, however, made a commitment of confidentiality to Anonymous and we intend to honour that commitment. Please be assured that Hachette takes its legal responsibilities seriously and \u2026 respectfully declines to provide you with the information your letter seeks,\u201d writes Ross. Anonymous\u2019s literary agency Javelin said that it supports Hachette \u201cin its resolve that the administration\u2019s effort to intimidate and expose the senior official who has seen misconduct at the highest levels will not prevent this book from moving forward. \u201cOur author knows that the president is determined to unmask whistleblowers who may be in his midst. That\u2019s one of the reasons A Warning was written,\u201d said Javelin. Little, Brown said that the author did not take an advance for A Warning, and that if there are royalties, they plan on donating them substantially to non-profit organisations that focus on government accountability and on supporting \u201cthose who stand up for the truth in repressive countries around the world\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
