The GMB and Unite unions will urge MPs on the Treasury select committee to recommend an end to lucrative tax breaks and increase the sector's accountability. There are concerns within Labour, however, that too dramatic a change could alienate business and even encourage the heads of some firms to fund the Tories. One senior backbencher sympathetic to criticisms of the industry warned that if the issue was not handled carefully, private equity bosses might \"do an Ashcroft\", a reference to the former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, by pouring money into Conservative campaigns in marginal constituencies. It underlines anxiety among some party loyalists that remarks from deputy leadership candidates are creating the impression of a party lurching to the left. Hazel Blears, Labour chairwoman, has expressed concern about the rhetoric used in attacks on private equity firms. \"She is saying, let's go carefully and not send signals that Labour is an anti-business party,\" said an aide. Private equity bosses have already signalled their determination to fight proposals for change when they appear before the committee today, despite some expectations that they might cave in and accept higher taxes. Directors of five of the biggest firms are giving evidence to the committee. Concern over excessive rewards for private equity bosses is expected to heighten when Blackstone goes ahead with a \u00a316bn listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The firm could list as early as this Friday, ahead of plans by Democrat senators to strip private equity partners of their generous tax breaks. This month, Gordon Brown told the GMB union that a Treasury review was already looking at \"what loopholes were being used and then to take action\". He added: \"We will make sure that there is justice and equity in the treatment of the tax arrangements in that area.\" But the review is not expected to be finished before November's pre-budget report. Paul Kenny, GMB secretary general, will criticise the record of industrial relations disputes arising out of private equity takeovers and the management techniques they use to drive up profits - citing examples of job cuts at the AA and Birds Eye."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
