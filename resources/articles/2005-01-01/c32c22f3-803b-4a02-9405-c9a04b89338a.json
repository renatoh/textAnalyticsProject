James Hill, the recently retired head of the US army's southern command, which oversees military operations in Latin America, said the Venezuelan leader was allowing Farc, a leftwing Colombian guerrilla group, to establish training camps in his country. He also said the Bolivian opposition leader, Evo Morales, is receiving funds from Mr Ch\u00e1vez as Bolivia faces a series of strikes and blockades that threaten its stability. The accusation comes days after Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state designate, called Mr Ch\u00e1vez \"deeply troubling\" at her Senate confirmation hearing. Ms Rice's comment followed a dispute between Venezuela and Colombia which broke out after it was revealed that Rodrigo Granda, a senior Farc leader, had been kidnapped from Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, by bounty hunters and taken to Bogota, the capital of Colombia. But General Hill's comments about Venezuela's influence in Bolivia may prove just as damaging. He told the Miami Herald: \"It is quite proven that he gave money to Evo Morales... and continues to do so.\" Mr Morales is expected to win an election if the president, Carlos Mesa, were to go. Mr Mesa is facing political pressure because leaders in Santa Cruz, the country's second biggest city and economic centre, want to set up an autonomous government. The city feels it is contributing a disproportionate amount of money to maintain the poorer parts of the country, and is demanding that recent rises in diesel and gas prices be revoked. Although Mr Morales is not involved in the Santa Cruz crisis his party, Mas, is fuelling opposition to the president and calling for nationwide demonstrations against the government next Monday. Privately, there is an admission that more radical actions could follow in a couple of months when major legislation will be discussed in parliament. According to a leading Bolivian opposition figure, Mr Morales radicalised his thinking as a result of the negative results of an opinion poll commissioned and paid for by the Venezuelans last year. Mr Morales then met Mr Ch\u00e1vez in December, when it was suggested to him that he change his strategy and become more radical to control the constituent assembly that will be convened next August. When asked by the Guardian about the Venezuelan poll, Mr Morales said: \"I don't care about polls nor pollsters.\" He added: \"Ch\u00e1vez definitely provides us with political support. He has taught us how to fight the American empire and how to turn the ruling elite into the opposition, and for that we admire him, but he doesn't support us economically.\" He said: \"Ch\u00e1vez isn't financing us. The only thing he has given is some money to pave a road in La Paz and some loans for education.\" However, a senior Mas source said: \"The Venezuelans planted doubts in us last December. They said we should ensure control over the constituent assembly before it convenes [next summer] so that the resulting constitution is the one we want, the same way Ch\u00e1vez did in Venezuela.\" According to this source, \"Evo definitely wants to gain power and import our version of Ch\u00e1vez's Bolivarian revolution to Bolivia.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
