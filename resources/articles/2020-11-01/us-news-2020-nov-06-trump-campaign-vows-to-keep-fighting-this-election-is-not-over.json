In return, Biden\u2019s spokesman, Andrew Bates, said: \u201cThe American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.\u201d Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge a probable Biden victory seems likely to set the scene for an ugly legal battle waged across several states. Given the incumbent is yet to provide any evidence of widespread voter fraud, it seems like this will be a futile fight. But the campaign insisted it would be waged in any case. \u201cThis election is not over,\u201d said the Trump campaign general counsel, Matt Morgan. \u201cThe false projection of Joe Biden as the winner is based on results in four states that are far from final.\u201d Morgan said the campaign was confident it would find \u201cimproperly harvested\u201d ballots in Georgia, and claimed there had been \u201cmany irregularities in Pennsylvania\u201d. In Nevada, according to Morgan, individuals cast mail-in ballots incorrectly. \u201cBiden is relying on these states for his phoney claim on the White House,\u201d he said, \u201cbut once the election is final, President Trump will be re-elected.\u201d The Trump campaign had not provided any evidence for these claims. Over the past six months Trump has repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power, when asked, and has claimed he will only lose if the election is rigged. Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chief of staffs and the country\u2019s top military officer, has said the armed forces would not get involved in the transfer of power. Biden, however, back in June said the military would remove Trump if it came to that. He told the Daily Show: \u201cI promise you, I\u2019m absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.\u201d Recount In Georgia on Friday morning, as Biden squeezed into a narrow lead, the state secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said there would be a recount. He also promised transparency. It seemed likely both Georgia Senate races, key to control of the upper chamber, would be decided in January runoffs. Biden\u2019s most significant lead was in Pennsylvania, where thousands of votes remained to be counted. The majority of those votes were from counties that lean heavily Democratic, the process taking longer than usual due to more votes having been cast by mail. Trump quoted a talking head on Fox Business when he tweeted that \u201cPhiladelpiha [sic] has got a rotten history on election integrity\u201d. But the Pennsylvania senator Pat Toomey was among Republicans edging away from what appeared to be the death throes of the Trump presidency. Toomey told NBC that though he thought \u201cthe president still has a very narrow path by which he can win\u201d, he also thought there was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d any \u201cevidence [of] significant large-scale fraud or malfeasance anywhere in Pennsylvania\u201d. Other senior party figures sprang to the president\u2019s defence. Several GOP politicians who might fancy themselves as contenders for the presidency in 2024 did so on Thursday night, after the president\u2019s sons goaded the party on Twitter. Among senators, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina \u2013 a former friend and ally of John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, once seen as a relative moderate but who swore fealty to Trump long ago \u2013 all raged against the tide of Biden votes, echoing the president\u2019s baseless claims of fraud. Of the counting in Pennsylvania, which is being watched by official Republican observers, Cruz echoed Trump\u2019s baseless claims of fraud when he told Fox News: \u201cI am more than a little frustrated that every time they close the doors and shut out the lights, they always find more Democratic votes.\u201d The three only intervened, however, after receiving a public shaming from Trump\u2019s sons Eric and Donald Jr. \u201cThe total lack of action from virtually all of the \u20182024 GOP hopefuls\u2019 is pretty amazing. They have a perfect platform to show that they\u2019re willing &amp; able to fight but they will cower to the media mob instead,\u201d tweeted Donald Trump Jr \u2013 seen by many as a possible 2024 contender himself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
