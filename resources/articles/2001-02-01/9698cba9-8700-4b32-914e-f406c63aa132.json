Two goals from Alex Bone cancelled out a Tore Andre Flo opening double before Ferguson struck to spare Dick Advocaat's side's blushes. Flo struck twice in the first 17 minutes to give Rangers what appeared to be a comfortable lead. But things are rarely simple as far as the fallen champions are concerned this season and only three minutes later Bone struck to put the Highlanders back in contention. Rangers' first goal was the result of a neat turn by Kenny Miller that left Brian Irvine floundering and his pass set up Flo for a cool finish into the bottom corner. Flo scored again after Neil McCann had supplied him with the ball, and this time it was Flo who turned Mark Perry before finding the same area of the goal. But County's response was immediate with their top scorer Bone latching on to a headed flick-on and burying the ball past Stefan Klos. County's goalkeeper Nicky Walker denied Flo a hat-trick with a fine diving save in the 33rd minute. County survived the resulting corner and con tinued to create chances with Karim Boukraa looking the man most likely. In the 53rd minute Flo fired an inviting chance wide and a minute later County stunned Rangers with an equaliser. The home fans were baying for a penalty when Irvine went down in the box with Bert Konterman at his back. Play continued but the ball was cleared only as far as the lurking Bone, who fired past Klos. The German keeper then produced a spectacular tip-over to deny Boukkra a stunning third from long range. But three minutes later Rangers restored their lead in the simplest manner when a pass through the centre of County's defence from Claudio Reyna picked out Ferguson's run and he slotted past Walker. County urged men forward and almost equalised with a minute to go when Klos missed a punch and Scott Wilson had to hack Irvine's header away before it crossed the line. \u0095 The Scottish FA has left Celtic and Dunfermline to arrange another suitable date for their Tennent's Scottish Cup fourth-round replay. The rematch at Parkhead was scheduled to go ahead on February 28 after the clubs drew 2-2 at East End Park yesterday. However, that date would have clashed with international week and Celtic could have been without more than nine first-team players and Andrius Skerla might have been missing from the Dunfermline side. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
