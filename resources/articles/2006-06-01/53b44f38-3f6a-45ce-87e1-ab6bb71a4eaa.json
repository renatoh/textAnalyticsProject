It is not there to make profits, but to act as a brand ambassador, building the company reputation. That helps to explain why it has had trouble coming to terms with the fact that, for the first time in its dynamic 17-year existence, it blundered, with the high-risk revamp almost eight months ago on October 24. For once, the flair for innovation - such as the dramatic reconstruction of the Hutton inquiry, or storming into Kosovo - deserted it all too publicly. That is not supposed to happen, and reflects badly on the parent company. The announcement last week that the channel is scuttling two flagships of the new schedule, the 7pm Sky Report news magazine programme and the 8pm Sky World News Report - both current affairs- style shows - comes as no surprise to the tiny band who watch them. They had scant appeal for Sky's youngish audience and, combined with other changes, sent out a message that Sky News was no longer the place in a busy world for a quick, no-nonsense news fix. As one seasoned British news executive and admirer of Sky News says: \"They have made a classic error, fixing that which was not broke.\" Strange idea In May, Sky News abandoned another strange idea, using three presenters for much of the day rather than the classic two. Here, its own research showed that viewers were confused. Holidays and sick leave also made it impossible to sustain stable trios. Veteran Sky News political editor Adam Boulton, who has been with the channel since its launch, says with relish that the future will be, if not back to basics, \"back to core values\". Indeed, with theatrical emphasis, on the day that Sky revealed its schedule would change from July 10 onwards, Sky News switched with gusto into rolling news mode, for the Rooney foot saga, the scare over \"anthrax\" powder in the parliamentary lobby, and the death of the al-Qaida leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. A further cloud is also darkening the station's newsroom. The relaunch went over budget by \u00a32.5m. Luring Eamonn Holmes from GMTV to present Sunrise, and James Rubin, former Clinton aide (and husband of CNN chief international reporter Christiane Amanpour), to front the World News Report was expensive. Dozens of new staff were employed to service the 7-9pm slots in separate teams. Around \u00a31m is now being taken from the annual \u00a335m budget, resulting in 17 job cuts, largely \"innocent bystanders\", the first cull for six years. Yet there was a rationale to the revamp. A challenge for all 24-hour news channels is how to build up audiences during quiet periods when nothing intensely dramatic - such as the South Asian tsunami or 7/7 - is happening. The revamp was an attempt to find the holy grail, to keep people watching longer, boosting audiences and (potentially) advertising. This thinking was encouraged by the Sky News move into an expensively custom-built and equipped news centre, long overdue, and reinforced by trouncing ITN to supply news for Channel Five. The problem is that this is not what viewers seem to want from news channels. \"They want news hard, fast and regularly - what Sky was doing well anyway and was exceptional in delivering,\" says a well-placed critic. (One interesting aside here is that BBC News 24 has not seen much increase in the time people spend watching it, despite the start of simulcasting of news programmes and big-name presenters). Yet the prosaic truth is that Sky News has not really abandoned news or breaking news, but marketing has, and it is harder to interrupt crafted current affairs programmes. The channel's response is not a complete U-turn. Nick Pollard, the outgoing head of Sky News and author of the relaunch (despite attempts to see the hands of the Murdochs and Dawn Airey in it), expects to weave in the more considered packages, reports, investigations and analyses from the two shows throughout the station's output. Pollard says: \"We are all in the business to push, to try and improve what we do. The criticism of rolling news is that there's not enough depth. You can't sit on your laurels.\" It is noticeable that none of the extra producers employed on the Sky Report are being made redundant. Rubin himself, an awkward television presence who stands out like a sore thumb among the seasoned Sky News faces of Jeremy Thompson, Martin Stanford, Anna Botting and Kay Burley, will stay on as a special contributor and interviewer. The final factor in all this is BBC News 24. A Sky insider says that for three years the news team struggled with how to respond, so used was it to being top dog and having the field largely to itself. News 24 arrived in less than sparkling form in 1997, but as Peter Horrocks, head of BBC television news, says: \"It's no longer a Cinderella service.\" Rather, it is the focus of BBC News efforts. He has been touring newspapers and government departments urging people to switch to News 24. Sharp new boss A realistic view is that News 24 was always going to overtake Sky News, as it did last year, but it does not mean that there is not a big gap for Sky News, always balanced and reliable, to exploit, by not being the BBC. It has some great producers, and a sharp new boss, John Ryley, who steps up from managing editor on his return from Wharton Business School in August. Ryley is expected to have thoughts on refocusing Sky News: an obvious ploy is to make a play for viewers at 9pm and 11 pm, before and after the BBC and ITV news programmes. The bigger truth is that Horrocks knows that the BBC needs Sky News as competition, especially after ITV's closure of the ITV News channel. One Sky news correspondent summed up the past six months this way: \"This year we've felt uniquely vulnerable, up against the BBC.\" Then he perked up: \"The only way we can survive is by being leaner, meaner, better, quicker.\" Sky News is unlikely to stay on the ropes for long."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
