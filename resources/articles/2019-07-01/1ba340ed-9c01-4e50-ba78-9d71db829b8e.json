Top stories The former US special counsel Robert Mueller has insisted that Donald Trump was not exonerated by his report into Russian interference in the 2016 US election, but offered little new ammunition to boost the case for the president\u2019s impeachment. Testifying at the first of two hearings on Capitol Hill, Mueller confirmed his finding that Russia launched a \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d attack on America\u2019s democracy and that Trump engaged in 10 instances of obstruction of justice. But Mueller disappointed Democrats by giving often monosyllabic responses such as \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d or \u201ccorrect\u201d, and at times seemed less familiar with his report than many of the questioners. The chairman of the corporate regulator gave \u201cno reason\u201d for killing off a long-running investigation into allegations that the Commonwealth Bank systematically ripped off term deposit customers. Documents released by Asic under freedom of information also reveal the regulator\u2019s senior executives were frustrated at the slow process of the investigation, which began in 2006 and was abandoned in early 2010. Asic executives were concerned that the bank had stopped being \u201ccandid\u201d in its internal documents after the investigation began, making it harder to get fresh evidence to support taking it to court over the alleged rort. Doubters have urged BHP to match action to its words after its head declared that tackling the climate crisis will require \u201cthe biggest global mobilisation since World War II\u201d. Shareholder advocates warned that BHP\u2019s pledge to do more on climate change, including setting targets for its customers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and linking executive pay to pollution reduction, should be viewed sceptically while it remained a member of groups that lobbied against significant action. Studies published overnight in Nature and Nature Geoscience have used extensive historical data to show there has never been a period in the past 2,000 years when temperature changes have been as fast and extensive as in recent decades. World The new UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has sacked more than half of Theresa May\u2019s cabinet and included hardline Brexiters Dominic Raab and Priti Patel in his new team. Rutger Hauer, best known for his role as android Roy Batty in the seminal sci-fi film Blade Runner, has died at the age of 75 in his native Netherlands. The search for two Canadian teenagers wanted by police investigating the murders of the Australian Lucas Fowler and his US girlfriend Chynna Deese has spread across the whole of northern Canada, with the latest sighting reported in northern Manitoba. The Netherlands and Belgium have recorded their highest temperatures, and the UK may also do so on Thursday, as a second extreme heatwave in consecutive months advances across Europe. Boeing has said it may halt production of the 737 Max jet as it reported the company\u2019s largest quarterly loss after two fatal accidents involving the plane. Opinion and analysis On 18 May, a sense of an incoming Labor government was replaced by shellshock for progressives that seemed to parallel what happened in Britain in 2015, writes Osmond Chiu in the latest part of the series Next Left. \u201cThere is a risk superficial debates on tax will overshadow the bigger challenge we face, the interlinked crises of inequality, democracy and the climate.\u201d He argues that Australia can draw on its postwar history of reconstruction to build a country with full employment and robust public services and infrastructure. \u201cThe transformation needed in a decade is possible, we did it in the aftermath of a destructive war in the 1940s and can do it again.\u201d Throughout Boris Johnson\u2019s six-week campaign for the Conservative leadership, friends and enemies alike wondered which Johnson would prevail, writes Jonathan Freedland. Would it be the twice-elected mayor of London, who won over a Labour-voting, progressive city, or would it be the leader of the Vote Leave campaign, whose lies and insults have led the US president himself to hail him as the British Trump? The complexion of his first cabinet suggests victory for the latter. But there are also signs that he wants to be both, that \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 he wants to have his cake and eat it. Sport England have plumbed new depths of cricket humiliation as they were bowled out for 85 by Ireland at Lord\u2019s in the first Test match between the two countries. The Irish in turn were dismissed for 207 on an astonishing first day. Dawn Fraser has weighed in on the controversy over Sun Yang, saying he should not be swimming at the world championships. The Australian Olympian joined Britain\u2019s Greg Rutherford in backing protests initiated by Mack Horton at the event in South Korea. Thinking time: It helps being called Rupert If there has been any pigeonholing in the career of Rupert Graves, it came at the start of his career, when his performances in the Merchant Ivory films Maurice and A Room With a View, as well as Where Angels Fear to Tread and A Handful of Dust, encouraged misconceptions about his background. His name only sealed the deal, he says. \u201cDo you know what? Genuinely, it helps in this business being called Rupert. I\u2019ve sniffed that attitude in acting: the Oxbridge thing. Making movies isn\u2019t a cheap exercise. You need money and the knock-on from that is the industry is populated by a lot of posh people. It\u2019s very hard to break into if you\u2019re not middle class and privately educated.\u201d Or if you don\u2019t have a name that suggests you are. But if being called Rupert boosted his chances, it was a blight on his early years. \u201cI hated it as a kid. I really wished I was called Pete \u2026 Rupert is a ridiculous name in 1970s Weston-super-Mare. Ridiculous! It\u2019s like being called Basil.\u201d Media roundup The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald report that Australian universities hosting Chinese government-funded education centres have signed agreements stating they must comply with Beijing\u2019s decision-making authority over teaching there. The Mercury splashes with the threat to Tasmania\u2019s salmon industry after the deaths of two people from listeria were linked to local products.
