Martial made an explosive debut after coming on as a substitute, a superb slaloming goal capping victory against United\u2019s bitterest rivals, but Carrick admitted knowing little about the 19-year-old for whom United paid \u00a336m on the final day of the transfer window. Carrick said of the acquisition from Monaco: \u201cI have to be totally honest, I didn\u2019t know an awful lot \u2013 like many \u2013 but I do now. We haven\u2019t really trained this week too much; by the time the lads have come back from internationals. We haven\u2019t seen an awful lot of him. It\u2019s a lot of money, of course it is. I suppose time will tell, won\u2019t it?\u201d The French striker is the world\u2019s most expensive teenager. With add-ons the fee could rise to \u00a358m, thus making Martial British football\u2019s second-highest transfer behind the \u00a359.7m \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda cost United. That is, indeed, a heck of a lot of money even in a super-inflated market. It should secure a high level of talent, especially for a club whose business is the serial pursuit of trophies, and Martial\u2019s weaving, jinking goal four minutes from time may be the first down payment on his astronomical fee. Yet two years after Sir Alex Ferguson retired \u2013 and following David Moyes\u2019s ill-starred period in charge \u2013 the uncertainty at United continues. It caused the fiasco of David de Gea\u2019s transfer to Real Madrid collapsing and the sanctioning of a \u201cridiculous\u201d price \u2013 Louis van Gaal\u2019s description \u2013 for a punt on Martial\u2019s potential, as the manager continues to rebuild. On the evidence of Martial\u2019s 25 minutes against Liverpool, Van Gaal might actually have found a footballer who, in time, can symbolise United\u2019s identity, just as Wayne Rooney currently does. Carrick said: \u201cTo start like that you can\u2019t really ask for more. It doesn\u2019t get any better than that, does it? Coming in and coming on and scoring against Liverpool like that. He has done well to get in that position and I thought the finish was terrific, how he just slotted it home. He was so calm and composed and you can\u2019t ask for a better start. \u201cHe is off the mark now. He has announced himself. Everyone has seen it on the big stage. I am sure his confidence will be sky high. It\u2019s a good way to settle him and if that has raised expectation then so be it but that is part of the game.\u201d Van Gaal had insisted Martial would be eased into the side but the hamstring injury that ruled out Rooney and is likely to keep the captain out of Tuesday\u2019s Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven meant Martial was given an early opportunity. Martial entered with United leading 1-0 from Daley Blind\u2019s opener. An Ander Herrera penalty and Christian Benteke\u2019s breathtaking overhead volley took the score to 2-1. Then came Martial\u2019s moment. Taking the ball on the left he twisted Liverpool\u2019s defence before beating Simon Mignolet with the kind of direct dribble and finish last seen by a player in United livery when Cristiano Ronaldo was at the club. So is Martial the real deal? Has Van Gaal been brave and made a prescient signing? A 25-minute cameo is too little to build a credible verdict on, of course. As with Van Gaal and his United team and how they might fare, the jury remains out. Now, the real work of offering consistently high performances begins. Van Gaal said: \u201cThat is why I am saying all of these things \u2013 that he is 19 years old, that he had to adapt, that we have bought him for the future, that he is for my successor. These are all signals from me that we have to protect him. You cannot expect from players of 19, 20 or 21 the same consistency of a Schweinsteiger or Carrick. I hope by my declarations it shall be that expectation dampens.\u201d Reminded that he called the fee ridiculous, Van Gaal said: \u201cWe have bought him because of his talent but you have to show your talent at the right time on the pitch and Martial has done that in his first match. We will have to wait and see if he can be consistent and do it every game. You have an average from strikers of around 50 or 60% [goal rate] every match. His average at Monaco was lower because his finishing was not so good but today it was 100%.\u201d In Rooney\u2019s absence Marouane Fellaini started at centre-forward and when Martial came on it was for Juan Mata rather than the Belgian. Van Gaal praised Fellaini and so the latter may well keep his place at PSV for the opening Champions League group match. Martial, though, has given Van Gaal a welcome dilemma regarding whether to name him in Tuesday\u2019s XI. \u201cYou will have to wait and see how the players recover,\u201d the manager said. \u201cThat is the most important thing because it was an important match \u2013 for everybody, also with the pressure, for the result against Liverpool \u2013 so they need three days to recover. Then I shall decide.\u201d The 64-year-old has won each of his three games managing United against their firm rivals. This latest victory takes the club to 10 points, five behind the leaders, Manchester City. Brendan Rodgers\u2019s Liverpool, though, were devoid of ideas throughout. On this evidence they \u2013 and the manager \u2013 have the more serious problems.
