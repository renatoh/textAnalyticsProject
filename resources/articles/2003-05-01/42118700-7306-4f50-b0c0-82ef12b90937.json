As always, the potential for violence topped the agenda, with the Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner, Andy Trotter, assuring all of us we have a right to protest today, but only if we liaise with the police and don't engage in any illegal acts. On the other side was a spokeswoman from Globalise Resistance (GR), one of the organised leftwing groups generally despised by the anarchist-direct activists' community. GR are joining the \"officially police sanctioned\" trade union march today, so there was nothing really to talk about on Today. Two things were missing. One was any voice from the direct activist movement. It was a great chance to put across points about why we are protesting and why protest doesn't need police permission to be legitimate. But again it was rejected by the direct activists who won't speak to the mainstream media, or are too scared to be regarded as a \"spokesperson\" for the movement, and are personally targeted by press and police as they have been in the past. As an activist journalist, I still think this is an opportunity missed every year, but I don't know the solution. The other thing missing was a politician or corporate spokesperson to talk about the issues we are all protesting about today. Where was the arms or oil company executive brought on to justify their position? The Today programme missed a chance to steer away from the usual May Day violence agenda. John Humphrys and Andy Trotter had a nice laugh about how bad weather was going to keep thousands of protesters away. The laugh is on them. After a few little showers, it's turned out lovely. By the time the Critical Mass bicycle ride began at 11am the sun was shining and spirits were high. Around 500 protesters on wheels met on the South Bank, to continue the tradition of reclaiming the road for a form of transport which is virtually safe, completely pollution free and extremely cheap. Critical Mass always gets lots of support from bus drivers, who must also have a distaste for suited businessmen driving into town, on their own, in their petrol-guzzling cars. This year, around 20 police had their own bikes, each mounted with its own little siren and flashing lights: less cumbersome than their usual motorbikes, and certainly more protester-friendly. We visited a few oil and arms companies, blocking the traffic outside to make our point, before cycling towards central London for a picnic and rest before the main event of the day - the huge protest outside Lockheed Martin, the world's biggest arms company. I sloped off for a peace vigil outside the Defence Export Services Organisation (Deso) off Bloomsbury Avenue, which was filmed by the BBC for tonight's news. I changed out of my luminous cycle gear and donned a white shirt covered in blood. OK, it was a publicity stunt, but it did the job of illustrating Deso's role: the sole aim of this organisation is to flog British defence equipment abroad, spending millions each year sending salesmen to some of the world's most brutal regimes. A bit more friendly banter, then it's off to the pub. Police wait outside, just to make sure. They already suspect our next stop is the main direct action protest, which will follow a route around arms and oil companies. So far, there's been no violence and pretty good relations between police and protesters - and not just because we share an interest in decent bicycles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
