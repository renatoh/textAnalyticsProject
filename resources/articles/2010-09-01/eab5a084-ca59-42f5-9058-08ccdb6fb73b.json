We're a European Tour. And even though a lot of our players are playing in America we have to draw the line. We need to finish the qualification for a European team on European soil.\" Europe's three wild-card picks were made last month, with the Italian rookie, Edoardo Molinari, forcing his way into the team at the expense of Paul Casey and Justin Rose after recording birdies at the last three holes of the Johnnie Walker Championship to win the final European qualifying tournament. Alongside Padraig Harrington and Luke Donald, who were selected as wild cards, Casey and Rose had become known as \"The FedEx Four\". Their decision to pursue a place in the play-offs for the USPGA's lucrative tour championship, the FedEx Cup, rather than travel to Gleneagles, seemed a direct snub to the European qualification process. Further controversy ensued when Colin Montgomerie, Europe's captain, then excluded Casey, recently ranked world No3, and Rose, the winner of two big tournaments in the US this summer. The debate has hardly lessened this past weekend as Casey finished second in the BMW Championship in Chicago to underline his credentials and form. McGinley knows he and Montgomerie will be pilloried should Casey's absence become even more glaring at Celtic Manor early next month. But McGinley is emphatic the right choice has been made in terms of upholding the integrity of the European Tour. \"It would be very strange if we were waiting on what happens on the PGA Tour in order to decide the European team. That just doesn't add up. We can stand on our own two feet. We're a strong enough tour with very good tournaments. We have a great finishing campaign every two years for the Ryder Cup and this is where we always need to finish \u2013 on our terms and not the Americans' terms.\" Rose has described the wild-card selection, with veiled derision, as \"interesting \u2026 I don't think many people would have gone with those three\". Paul Azinger, who captained the USA to victory in the last Ryder Cup, was more predictably blunt: saying Europe had made a \"shocking\" decision. Even Donald suggested that \"the team has to look harder at the qualification system and whether it's the correct way\". McGinley dismisses that view. He is convinced the desire on the European Tour to retain the current system has been bolstered. \"I've no doubt about that. I think if anything changes it will be that we don't clash with the first round of the FedEx. Otherwise, it's 101% certain that qualification will finish on European soil. \"We knew that, whoever we picked, there was going to be criticism. Ideally, we would have loved to have had Justin Rose and Paul Casey in the team. Who wouldn't? But the bottom line is that they had put themselves in a precarious position by not qualifying. Unfortunately, they missed out \u2013 and that's also down to the wonderful golf Edoardo Molinari played. Luke Donald has also played well and we've gone with Padraig Harrington who has won three majors. \"Casey has a valid argument but Monty made the three picks on the basis of internal discussions with us and the top players on the team. So he had done his homework and it was a time to be calculated and to work out quite clinically who are the best three picks for the team.\" How important is a player's ability to bond with his team-mates? \"It's a major ingredient. There's no doubt. But a lot of things went into the pick and they weren't made on a whim.\" Did the fact that Casey is an unpopular figure on the European Tour count against him? \"All I can say is that a number of things went into the selection but the thing that hurt Paul most of all was that he hadn't qualified. He might be No7 in the world but he didn't qualify for the team.\" McGinley admits that he felt more annoyed with his old friend Harrington's reluctance to ensure his place on the team. \"I was disappointed in Padraig. He was \u20ac1,200 away from the team after the PGA and he didn't play the last two qualifying events. Padraig only played three events in Europe this year \u2013 the Irish Open, Wentworth and the Open. So he didn't show a lot of commitment.\" Has McGinley expressed his dissatisfaction personally to Harrington? \"Padraig is not the kind of guy you can tell what to do. He makes up his own mind. We've had arguments about it in the past and we'll have arguments about it again. But he is his own man.\" Molinari might be far less established than any of the \"FedEx Four\" but the way in which he nailed down his place at Gleneagles underlines both his talent and his temperament. \"Absolutely. If you look at the history of the Ryder Cup it's been the rookies who have won the most vital points for Europe. So you want a guy who is chomping at the bit to play the Ryder Cup. And it's important to give the opportunity to young guys coming through \u2013 and not just use the world rankings. I think it's great that someone like Edoardo Molinari, who only joined the tour in January, can make the Ryder Cup in nine months. That's part of the romance of sport.\" McGinley draws a link between the pressure Molinari overcame last month and his own performance in making his second Ryder Cup team in 2004 \u2013 when everything came down to the final putt on the final hole of his last qualifying tournament. His playing partner that day, Sweden's Fredrik Jacobson, was competing directly against him for the coveted last Ryder Cup place. \"I had to finish ahead of Freddie and I remember I got to the course on the Thursday morning. I looked at the leaderboard and saw that Freddie had already shot 63 and I thought: 'Oh my God, this is going to be a big task.' But I stuck to it and the fact that I came through gave me such a psychological boost. \"In my opinion I played the best of my three Ryder Cups in Detroit that year. I won my three matches and a lot of that was down to the fact that I had qualified in such style and proven to myself that I was a worthy player on that team. I got all the glory at the Belfry [two years before when McGinley famously sank the putt that won the Cup] but I played a bigger role in Detroit.\" McGinley, as popular as he is lucid, is also exceptional in team competitions. \"I played a lot of Gaelic football and my passion comes from that. I also love the whole atmosphere of the Ryder Cup. Even with the American national anthem I get goosebumps. And when the Americans wave their flags and shout 'Go USA' that really fires me up. I love it when the crowd goes crazy when you hole a putt. It sends a shiver down me. It gives me a turbo-boost. And I love the team meetings. I get a real buzz out of being in the same room where everyone is pulling for the team and not just thinking about the individual.\" Earlier this summer McGinley predicted a handsome European victory, but he sounds more cautious now. \"A couple of months ago we were quite clear favourites \u2013 but things have changed. We have been hurt by Lee Westwood's injury. There's no doubt about that. It's going to be an unknown factor until Lee turns up that week and we see how he feels, having not competed since the Open. That's a disappointment for Europe. \"I also think the American team has got a lot stronger over the last two months and we've had some issues \u2013 none more so than Lee having been injured and not having played. He's our No1 player so I think it's going to be a very close Ryder Cup.\" Does McGinley expect Westwood to be fit enough to play at Celtic Manor? \"I'm confident and Lee's confident. But you never know with these injuries. I know he's starting to practise [this week] so he's still got plenty of time.\" McGinley turned down the opportunity to be a vice-captain on the last Ryder Cup because of his qualms about being an adviser rather than a participant. \"Last time It really scared me to face the prospect of being at a Ryder Cup without my golf clubs. Two years down the road I'm more prepared. I'm really looking forward it but I know one part of me will be quite sad. It's going to be difficult to be in the team room when everyone is buzzing about playing. And me not even having my golf clubs will be really weird \u2013 but I'm ready.\" McGinley believes Montgomerie is just as prepared and says the Scot has managed to block out the turmoil surrounding his private life. \"I've not noticed any change in Monty and the way he has handled this whole process has been so impressive. He's very well organised and he's revelling in his role. He's going to be a great success. \"It would be a great honour if I get to do the same as captain one day. But that's a long way down the road and my immediate focus is helping Monty and the team. It's very important we win the Ryder Cup again \u2013 and I think we've got just the team to do it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
