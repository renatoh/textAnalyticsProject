I would have thought their search might have warned them this could have been a possibility. How can I avoid suffering the same or similar fate? Local authority searches are designed to give you important information about the land your house is built on and its surrounding areas, but some homeowners have felt let down by their searches. The search should reveal planning proposals such as new roads, changes to road layouts, building developments in the vicinity and alterations to land use or public rights of way. To avoid getting into a situation such as your friends suffered, you ought to ask your solicitor exactly how wide an area the local authority search covers. If he replies that the search takes in the immediate environs, ask exactly what this means - is it the site of your property, your immediate neighbours or the whole street? There are other concerns prospective homebuyers might want to be reassured about before deciding whether to buy. The local authority search may not always reveal the full picture on risks such as contaminated land or the chances your property will get flooded in the future, for example. Landmark is an organisation that offers homebuyers maps and information concerning environmental risks. The company's Envirosearch Residential service covers a radius of up to 500 metres and provides information on site history and other environmental factors that are not covered in the local authority search. It is available through solicitors and conveyancers within 24-48 hours and costs about \u00a339. Other useful information sources include the Environment Agency. Its website allows you to carry out flood-plain searches by postcode, while Homecheck's website offers a free postcode search that will tell you about flood risks, subsidence and pollution risks in your area.
