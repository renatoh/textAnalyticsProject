It\u2019s not even past.\" William Faulkner\u2019s words came to mind when Tony Abbott admired the \"skill and the sense of honour that [Japanese soldiers] brought to their task\" during the second world war. In the abstract, Abbott\u2019s comments might sound innocent but, of course, they were uttered, as the prime minister understands quite well, in a particular context. For Japan\u2019s rightwing, the second world war still matters immensely. Japanese nationalists \u2013 such as Shinzo Abe, the current prime minister \u2013 have made the nation\u2019s military history a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, part of a campaign to reshape the nation today. Abe has, for instance, visited the graves of executed war criminals, denied that Japan maintained a puppet state in Manchuria, and belittled the army\u2019s sexual slaves, the so-called comfort women. If Japan\u2019s past can be rehabilitated, it\u2019s much easier to argue for a militarised future \u2013 and so revisionism about the crimes of imperial Japan has gone hand in hand with the reinterpretation of Japan\u2019s \"pacifist\" constitution, so as to allow Japanese troops to participate in military actions abroad. That\u2019s why the Chinese media responded so angrily to Abbott\u2019s remarks. But there\u2019s another, less obvious, question raised by Abbott\u2019s praise of Japanese military prowess, one relating to domestic rather than international politics. How is it that a prime minister can praise Japanese soldiers when the skill and honour of those Indigenous people who resisted white settlement receive no official acknowledgement at all? In his book Forgotten War, Henry Reynolds notes the clear consensus among military historians: the frontier conflicts between colonists and Indigenous Australians \u2013 during which tens of thousands died \u2013 constituted a war. John Connor from the Australian Defence Force Academy says bluntly there can be no doubt \"that from the 1790s to the 1920, Australian Aborigines fought British soldiers, police and British-born and Australian-born settlers for the control of the continent\". Yet that war \u2013 one of the most profound events in the nation\u2019s history \u2013 remains entirely uncommemorated. By contrast, we venerate wars of little, if any, national significance. In 1885, amidst a wave of jingoism, the NSW government hastily sent 700 men to assist the British cause in Sudan \u2013 a bizarre and blundering adventure in which the troops made no real military contribution and probably never even fired a shot in anger. Nevertheless, the Australian War Memorial records on its wall the names of casualties suffered in the expedition, all of whom succumbed to disease rather than enemy action. During the 1880s, more than 2,000 people were killed in Australia by frontier clashes between settlers and Aborigines. As it happens, the conflict probably reached its crescendo at the same time as the Sudan crisis. \"Australians were engaged in two wars during 1885,\" Reynolds says. \"One was serious and deadly. The other was neither. One was fought in Australia, the other on the far side of the world. The fact that the nation commemorates one while ignoring the other is an anomalous situation that demands explanation.\" Tony Abbott\u2019s comments hint at what that explanation might be. Japan boasts one of the largest militaries in the world, and the US has long wanted it deployed to various security operations. That\u2019s why Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel called the reinterpretation of the \"peace constitution\" \"an important step for Japan as it seeks to make a greater contribution to regional and global peace and security\". Australia, inevitably, agrees. Hence Abbott\u2019s remarks. Equally, a recognition of Indigenous resistance has obvious implications. Last week, Tony Abbott explained that the nation was \"unsettled\" or \"scarcely settled\" before the British arrived. If you accept that, it\u2019s a lot easier to minimise the government\u2019s responsibilities to Indigenous people, and to downplay their rights over (say) valuable mining leases. Alternatively, if Abbott were to acknowledge that Indigenous Australians fought with skill and with honour, before being militarily defeated by white colonists, they would be given an agency denied them by traditional histories. Such a statement would also highlight the violence inherent in the settlement project, naturally raising questions about land rights. These are debates about the past but the issues they raise are not dead. On the contrary, they\u2019re vital for shaping our future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
