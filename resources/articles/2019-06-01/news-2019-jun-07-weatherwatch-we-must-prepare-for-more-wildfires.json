But now the threat to the British Isles of large-scale wildfires has moved us into a different league. It is not just southern Europe that can expect serious forest fires. Along with Sweden, Latvia and Germany the UK has been added to the high-risk areas included in the European Forest Fire Information System. Observations show that more intense wildfires are happening over a longer period across Europe. In the first four months of this year the service recorded 1,233 fires above 30 hectares in extent, more than for the whole of 2018. Some of them were in Scotland where large areas have been particularly dry. Most fires are started by people and because of climate heating rapidly grow out of control. Scientists from the Commission are working out how best to reduce the fire risk to people and property and are particularly concerned about the dangers of abandoned farmland on the edge of residential areas. These unmanaged wilder areas with tinder dry undergrowth are a serious fire risk. The EU Civil Protection organisation is also establishing a fleet of fire fighting planes and helicopters to help in serious emergencies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
