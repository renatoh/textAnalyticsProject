That taxes the imagination. Australia's Test team captain - who has just been reappointed for the coming Tests against Pakistan that precede the Ashes series - has joined Kent for the final six weeks of the season. The estimated \u00a315,000 he will receive for appearing in Kent's final nine matches, four in the championship and five in the National League, will make the fun even more terrific, of course, but there is good reason to take Waugh at his word. He has just endured a year of unprecedented difficulty. \"The last year has not been as enjoyable as I would have liked, certainly not as enjoyable as the previous 16 or 17 years,\" he says. \"That's why my goal is to go out there and enjoy my cricket and see if I can still improve. \"I want to see the beauty in the game again. I want to see the little things to remind me why I played cricket first up when I was a six- or seven-year-old in the back yard. I want to remind myself why I love the game. \"Sometimes that can be lost in the professionalism of the modern game, the money you are earning and the pressures you are under.\" Waugh, 37, whose twin Mark will be playing for Essex, has had something of a rough ride since he limped his way to an unbeaten 157 against England in the final Test at the Oval last summer. Since then form and health have betrayed him and he has been dumped as Australia's one-day captain, a savage blow to the pride of a man who often wears his baggy green cap at social occasions. After tearing a calf muscle towards the end of last summer he suffered deep vein thrombosis on the return flight to Australia. \"It bled pretty badly on the flight. I had a large haematoma from behind my knee down to my ankle, which filled with blood and crushed one of the veins, which led to the DVT. \"It was pretty serious. I was housebound for six weeks.\" He returned to the side but in nine Tests since the Oval has scored only 314 runs at 24 and another bad series against Pakistan would put his Ashes place in doubt. His one-day sacking still rankles. \"We had just beaten South Africa 5-1 in six Tests. There's not much more you can do than demolish the second best side in the world. It still feels strange when the one-day side goes away and I'm not there.\" Waugh has had some success in county cricket before. Appearing for Somerset in 1987 and 1988, he scored 1,626 runs at 85.57. A most interesting and interested cricketer, he has visited Mother Teresa in India and Nelson Mandela in South Africa; he visited the grave of Frank Worrell in Barbados and talked cricket, deeply, with an octogenarian Bill O'Reilly. He is bewildered by the recent comments from the former England coach David Lloyd, who questions the wisdom of allowing Waugh to play for Kent just before an Ashes series. \"I didn't come here to spy on players. I can watch them on TV. David's being a bit paranoid. What he said was ridiculous, and it's surprising coming from someone who's been in the game a long time and knows his cricket. Perhaps he was looking at the TV ratings. \"I'm here to enjoy some cricket. And I want to score some big runs. Those of us who are not in the one-day side have had a long break and I'll soon be facing Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Shoaib Akhtar. This was a good option for me and I'll try to win games for Kent as I do for any side I play for.\" It is a good option for the Kent players too. If they have any sense they will sit Waugh in a corner and bleed him until he is ashen. They should ask him to talk and teach until his tongue is dry and swollen. No current cricketer has more to impart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
