Less than six months into his second spell in the job Smith, with about \u00a35m spent on players already and a League Cup semi-final against Liverpool to look forward to, has started planning the pre-season tour and this week will dispatch a club official to Beijing to try to tie up a deal for two more Chinese internationals. Things are well and truly on the up for a club who have spent 16 months in administration, and Smith, despite failing to win this one, pronounced himself more than satisfied after an entertaining derby which either side could have won but in which his Palace team, lacking the suspended Neil Ruddock, played the more fluent football. \"The average age of my side was just over 21 and from now on that's the way I can see us going,\" he said. \"In the second half their commitment and passing was really good. That's as good as we get without winning.\" His demeanour would have been a lot different if QPR had managed to build on their early lead, but then again Smith is probably aware of the hosts' propensity to implode this season. Stan Bowles knows all about it too and the former QPR forward had written in the club programme that \"this game has draw written all over it so I'll bang a fiver on at 1-1. As for the first goalscorer, who else but Peter Crouch?\" And so it came to pass as the giant striker met Richard Langley's inswinging corner at the near post to score with a splendid volley. \"We've worked on it in training,\" Crouch said afterwards. \"Clarke Carlisle blocks the defender and it allows me to get free.\" Though Palace's ever-lively Mikael Forssell had opportunities either side of the goal and Simon Rodger saw an effort cleared off the line by Chris Plummer, Rangers had the chances to kill the game but Crouch and Stuart Wardley wasted good opportunities. Notions of only a fourth league win of the season were dismissed in the second half, however, and Palace equalised after Matthew Rose crashed a clearance into the face of his own goalkeeper and the ball fell nicely for Clinton Morrison, who finished neatly from eight yards. Further chances were spurned by Forssell, Andrejs Rubins and Dougie Freedman and at the whistle QPR were grateful for their 13th draw of the season and the point that lifted them off the bottom. \"There's nothing wrong with our workrate and spirit but we've got to start turning these draws into wins,\" said Gerry Francis, their director of football."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
