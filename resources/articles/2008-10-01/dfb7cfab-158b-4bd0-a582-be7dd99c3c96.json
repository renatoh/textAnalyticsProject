My work took me to places such as Srebrenica, Foca and Gorazde, the scene of wartime horrors. But in all of them I saw people try to move forward with their lives, despite the turmoil of the past. What, then, roused these concerns about the situation in Bosnia? The answer is a Guardian article last week by the international community's former high representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Paddy Ashdown, and chief architect of the Dayton Agreement, Richard Holbrooke, in which they express their fears of another war and for \"the survival of Bosnia as a state\". Bosnia, they say, \"is in real danger of collapse ... the suspicion and fear that began the war in 1992 has been reinvigorated.\" They are worried about the Bosnian Serb prime minister Milorad Dodik's attempts to bring the Republika Srpska (RS) to a \"position to secede if the opportunity arises\", and the actions of Haris Silajdzic, the Bosniak member of the presidency, who wants to abolish the entity system that devolves power to smaller areas. The success of the nationalist parties in the recent local elections and \"a distracted international community\" also concern Ashdown and Holbrooke. This article will undoubtedly damage Bosnia's already fragile reputation. So is the panic justified? Is Bosnia accelerating towards disaster? The answer, quite simply, is no. Tensions have risen and fallen since the conflict ended. Dodik has for a number of years used the threat of the RS's secession to reinforce his position of power, and Silajdzic has been calling for the entities to be abolished for even longer. Furthermore, the nationalist parties have always been the most successful in elections. The real worry for Bosnia at the moment is the recovery of its devastated economy. Thirteen years after international efforts to rebuild the country began, poverty and unemployment are still rampant. The biggest threat to the country's security is the frustration of unemployed young people. Inaccurate representations of Bosnia damage the economy by deterring much-needed foreign investors and by threatening the growing tourism industry. This summer has seen tourists flock to the country. Two of the friends who asked me whether Bosnia was slipping back into war had visited Bosnia this year. One told me that he had found locals very friendly and the countryside beautiful, despite the presence of damaged buildings from the war. He felt no sense of tension, but would have thought twice about the trip had he seen the article before he booked. Asim, who runs a hostel in Sarajevo, has received emails from guests who had read the article and wanted to know about the situation in the capital. He set up the hostel in February with a single dormitory and has since expanded: in the summer he was fully booked. \"It's a political game,\" he says, \"but if people who have been here are scared, think about people that have never seen what Bosnia is really like.\" Tourism has the potential to play a huge role in stimulating Bosnia's economy \u2013 and in the long term it is a thriving economy that will bring stability to the region. Efforts do no need to be made to ensure Bosnia's revival is permanent. But this demands careful analysis and reasoned dialogue. Ashdown and Holbrook's article has not helped. Much like Dodik and Silajdzic, their rhetoric is self-serving and their assertions bear little relation to the situation on the ground. Unfortunately, just as with Bosnian leaders, the price of their careless words will be borne by the Bosnian people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
