A council meeting of the Racehorse Owners Association on Thursday considered proposals issued by the Horsemen's Group that will secure its finances by asking owners, along with trainers, jockeys and others, to pay a small contribution towards running costs. The Horsemen's Group has in the last couple of years campaigned with some success for better prize money from racecourses but concerns have been raised over its financial viability with a \u00a3500,000 start-up loan from the British Horseracing Authority already outstanding. The ROA chief executive, Richard Wayman, described Thursday's meeting as having featured \"a positive and constructive discussion\", despite some ROA members having already made public their concerns over asking owners to help meet costs. \"The council agreed that it is essential that a realistic and sustainable funding plan is put in place so that the Horsemen's Group can focus its full attention on delivering improved prize money to owners and other horsemen, including by establishing prize money agreements with racecourses,\" he said. \"The council's position will be discussed with our partners on the Horsemen's Group at our board meeting next Tuesday.\" The ROA is one of five groups represented within the Horsemen's Group, with trainers and stable staff having already voted in favour of offering financial support."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
