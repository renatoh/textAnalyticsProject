Under the proposals, the First Division will be known as the Coca-Cola League Championship, the Second Division will become the Coca-Cola League Championship One and the Third Division will be renamed Coca-Cola League Championship Two. Coca-Cola takes over from the Nationwide as the Football League's sponsor at the start of next season in a three-year deal worth \u00a315m. The league's 72 clubs will vote on the name change at their annual general meeting next month but the country's main supporters' group claimed that fans should have been consulted and that the proposals represent another worrying break with tradition. Malcolm Clarke, chair of the Football Supporters Federation, said: \"It would have been nice for the Football League to consult fans about what they think about the new name. I think most fans realise that sponsorship plays an important role in football but this is another example of the game breaking with tradition. \"There are many fans who would like to stick with tradition. There's a feeling that branding within the game and the increase in commercialisation has led to football losing some of its status and history.\" The renaming of the Football League is part of a wider rebranding process being carried out by club directors who have hired the advertising company TBWA to examine ways of raising the competition's profile and increase sponsorship opportunities. New logos, community programmes and a number of other commercial initiatives are also being introduced from the start of next season as part of the league's new image."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
