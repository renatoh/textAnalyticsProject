Another perfectly efficient ITV drama, nuts and bolts firmly in place, gears working smoothly enough to pass inspection \u2013 you can imagine a white-coated Narrative Consultant reaching the end of a neatly-ticked column of boxes on his clipboard \u2013 is just the thing for a cold snap. It might not compel on a spring evening pregnant with possibility but, during a chilly spell, curled up on the sofa, its machinations unspool at just the right pace and with the right amount of predictability. It is the perfect fireside storyteller. Cheat is the tale of two women locked in what looks like \u2013 if the prison and morgue scenes that frame the flashback meat of the thing are anything to go by \u2013 mortal-for-someone combat. Leah Dale (Katherine Kelly, doing her best in a part that requires her to do little more than narrow her eyes in suspicion) is a Cambridge lecturer hoping for a permanent post at the university and maybe not the baby she and her husband (Adam, played by Tom Goodman-Hill) are trying for. It is not clear whether it is the impact a baby would have on her career, or the fact that she is given to masturbating furiously in the nearest loo after any conversation she has with a certain colleague of Cantabrigian handsomeness, that most puts her off the idea of crotchfruit. Leah also has a cat, whose name should be Chekhov\u2019s gun. It is a fact that any beloved feline entwining itself in a protagonist\u2019s legs in the first act should be found dead under mysterious circumstances by the beginning of the third. Don\u2019t get too attached to the cat, is what I\u2019m saying. Rose Vaughan (Molly Windsor) is a disaffected student, who habitually turns up unprepared and hostile to Leah\u2019s lectures, apparently feeling that her father\u2019s gargantuan financial donation to the college is enough to justify her place there. It is she, alas, who overhears Leah in the loo post-handsomeness. And it is she, alas, whom Leah suspects has handed in an essay she didn\u2019t write and whom she fails for suspected cheating. Every exchange between them, thereafter, torques the relationship and gives Windsor a chance to rise, in pitch-perfect increments, to the occasion of creating a chilling character of utterly believably threatening proportions. Rose needles Leah about working at the same university as her own father (is Leah keen to punish Rose because she thinks they are both riding on paternal coat tails, or is she annoyed, as she would be by any coasting student?). Leah retaliates with the suggestion that Rose\u2019s cheating would probably have gone undetected if she hadn\u2019t paid for an essay with such a good mark: \u201cYou must have a very high opinion of yourself.\u201d Soon Leah is reporting her suspicions to the university and humiliating the still-work-shy Rose in class. Meanwhile, Rose \u2013 with the help of glamoured university employee Ben Jarvis (Burn Gorman) \u2013 has discovered Leah\u2019s address, timetable and domestic animal situation and has taken to turning up at her house in the pouring rain, wearing a vest top, while only Adam is home, and handing over essay notes in a flirtatious manner. Humiliating, though not technically libellous, based as it is on truth, graffiti about Leah appears in the loo of self-pleasure. And hang on \u2013 when was the last time anyone saw the cat? The closing scenes bring us back to the present, where the escalating feud seems to have ended in murder. \u201cThey both look so innocent. Rose Vaughan and Leah Dale,\u201d says the detective in charge of the case (Jimmy Akingbola), looking from photograph to photograph. He is not convinced they have arrested the right one. Nor are we, because of Dramatic Cleverness and Narrative Sleight-of-Hand. Back at the prison, the visit between Rose and Leah is intercut with images of a punctured male body in the morgue. \u201cYou don\u2019t miss him, do you?\u201d says Rose, who generally likes to while away her time by flaying the nearest psyche until it is time to go and decorate another loo with embarrassing but accurate summaries of past activities by lecturers therein. \u201cAmazing how quickly you can adjust to not having someone if you never really loved them in the first place. Do you feel guilty?\u201d But for what? For why? Find out by Friday, if the weather holds! \u2022 This article was amended on 12 March 2019. An earlier version incorrectly referred to the husband character as Alan \u2013 his name is Adam."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
