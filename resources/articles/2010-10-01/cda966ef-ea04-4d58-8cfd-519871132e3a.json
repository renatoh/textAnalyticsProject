I'd been busy, too busy to make it to the country, and I'd missed a walk in the woods and amber light streaming through branches. It was a blustery day, and a hard, cold wind pelted rain at an angle as if it was deliberately trying to rattle the remains of the leaves from the trees. The light was as low as it could be without it being the gloaming hour, and we made our way up into the tree walk to try and escape the gloom. It was like being at sea in the already naked treetops, and we scurried back to earth with a definite dose of vertigo. It was not the day I had planned for, but the salvia border, which runs along a warm wall that faces on to the rock garden, lifted my spirits. Pushing against the tide of the season, it was ablaze with flower: hot pink and lipstick reds, indigo-blue, violet and purple. It was as if the border had sensed the winter coming, and the plants were partying hard before the lights went out for good. I stood there in the gloom with their reflected colour radiating around me and made a pact to get to know them better. I have been gardening with salvias for as long as I can remember, but it is only relatively recently that I have ventured away from the \"staples\". Purple-leaved sage, with its musky mound of dull, light-absorbing foliage, and the hardy herbaceous salvias have been a mainstay, but there are several dozen \"exotics\" that are perfectly hardy given the right conditions. Though they like sun and do best if given a baking, they are no more difficult than lavender and also like sharp drainage to get them through the winter. Many are excellent in drought conditions, so they are increasing in popularity with unpredictable summers. Right now one of the best plants in my garden is a Salvia x jamensis, which I have had in a pot for the best part of a decade. It has weathered a degree of neglect \u2013 I can't remember repotting it, and it is in flower by the longest day of the year and will still be going strong by the shortest if it escapes the frost. The hot-pink flowers remind me of a lip pushed forward in a pout and they are as light as butterflies and appear to dance over the bush. It is naturally shrubby and over the winter the wiry framework will defoliate, but I will wait until March to shape it up with the shears. S x jamensis is typical of a group of shrubby salvias which are difficult to tell apart because they are similar in habit, but their flowers are distinct in terms of colour. I have Salvia greggii \"Sungold\" in the garden at the studio, where the colour theme is lit by whites and yellows, but I have been defeated so far in positioning S microphylla \"Hot Lips\". This is a confection of a flower demanding a certain amount of attention with its slash of bright rose pink breaking a sparkly white base. I plan to use it among Pelargonium \"Purple Unique\" in pots on a hot terrace. In the group there will also be the Peruvian Salvia discolor. This is definitely tender, but only as tender as pelargoniums are in London, and will come through winter in a sheltered corner. It has silver undersides to the foliage and hooded flowers that are almost black. Touch the leaf and it is sticky with essential oils that smell strongly of blackcurrants. Blue is well represented, and it is hard to beat S patens. The flowers are large and relatively solitary among the felty foliage, and they are wonderful over a foil of silver stachys or acaena. It is a low-growing plant and needs light all around it to do well. The garden here is too competitive an environment for it now, but S guaranitica has thrived here, as it is tall and vigorous. \"Blue Enigma\" is a wonderful selection, starting to flower in July and out until it is frosted. Growth is strong, its foliage a bright lime green, and the flowers are hooded with a dark calyx which enhances the intensity in the blue. It forms a swollen rhizome below ground that fuels the shoulder\u2011height growth, and I'll protect this with a deep mulch if the winter is hard. I find it hard to countenance how such an exotic thing can do so well so far from its home in South America, but here it is, lighting up my garden still, its gentian-blue flowers defiant and powering on strongly.
