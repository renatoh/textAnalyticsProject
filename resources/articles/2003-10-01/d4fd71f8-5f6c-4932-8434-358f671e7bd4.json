Pleat stepped in as Spurs' caretaker manager after the dismissal of Glenn Hoddle, whose summer investment of \u00a311.75m in the strikers Helder Postiga, Bobby Zamora and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 did not coincide with improved results on the pitch. Spurs' chairman Daniel Levy, who is still in the process of recruiting Hoddle's long-term replacement, said: \"We have continued to invest and take difficult decisions that will benefit Tottenham Hotspur in the long run, even against the uncertainty surrounding television and media revenues. \"[However,] notwithstanding our ambitions to succeed, the spending pattern this summer is not one that is sustainable over the longer term. Inevitably, trading will be influenced by the performance and success of the team over the remainder of the current season.\" Yesterday's announcement of the club's annual results came seven weeks later than those for the corresponding year to June 30, 2002. Tottenham had been under threat of seeing trading in their shares suspended but this was avoided by the publication of their results 24 hours ahead of today's Stock Exchange deadline. Although the \u00a37.1m loss - on a turnover that improved \u00a31.5m to \u00a366.5m - was in stark contrast to the \u00a30.9m pre-tax profit of the previous year, this was significantly affected by a\u00a35.1m write-down in the club's valuation of Sergei Rebrov and of \u00a32.1m for Ben Thatcher. Tottenham's overall debt rose more than \u00a33.5m to \u00a310.64m, a factor that the club's new finance director Matthew Collecott, who comes in from the club's owners Enic and is a former accountant with PricewaterhouseCoopers, must tackle after Paul Viner left the club abruptly. Collecott will also be charged with finding alternative finances after a proposal for a rights issue, whereby sale of new stock would have produced fresh funding for Spurs, collapsed due to a lack of interest. Levy reiterated that he would press ahead with plans to expand the club's White Hart Lane ground, though a move - perhaps to the national stadium at Wembley - is under consideration unless there is improved government investment in the local transport infrastructure. At Anfield, the Liverpool and England midfielder Steven Gerrard has revealed he is close to signing a new deal. The Liverpool captain said his ambition was to restore the Merseysiders to former glories both in the league and in Europe. \"I wouldn't be signing a long-term contract if I didn't feel we had the squad and the ability to be challenging for honours,\" Gerrard, told Liverpool's website, www.liverpoolfc.tv. \"I want to be going for the title and the Champions League. \"I'm a Liverpool boy and I don't want to leave the club. I want to help this club become successful again and to be here, playing my part, when it is.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
