Robert Buckland denied that cuts to prison officer numbers and probation services might have played a role in increasing the risk from terrorism, and said \u201cpublic protection\u201d had to be at the centre of any response to the deaths on Friday of Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones. But Buckland faced criticism from Phillip Lee, the former Conservative justice minister who defected to the Liberal Democrats in September. Lee said the response had to be based around investment in courts and probation, accusing Johnson of instead using \u201cthe Trump playbook\u201d. Buckland reiterated the government\u2019s stance that Labour was ultimately to blame for the release of Usman Khan, who carried out the stabbings, as his early release last year came under sentencing guidelines passed by the last Labour government. Labour called the idea \u201cludicrous\u201d. Merritt\u2019s father expressed outrage at newspaper coverage of Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to respond to the attack with a \u201cblitz\u201d against terrorists freed from jail. In a tweet, David Merritt hit out at what he called \u201cvile propaganda\u201d, saying: \u201cJack stood against everything you stand for \u2013 hatred, division, ignorance.\u201d Khan was released under licence seven years into a jail term imposed for taking part in an al-Qaida-inspired bomb plot. At a conference on prisoner rehabilitation he killed Merritt, 25, a course coordinator for Learning Together, a programme run by Cambridge University\u2019s criminology institute, and Jones, 23, who was volunteering at the event. Khan was tackled by members of the public on London Bridge and shot dead by police. Asked if he was \u201ca little ashamed\u201d about the use of the death of two young people for electoral purposes\u201d, Buckland told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI do think we need to pause and get the tone of this debate right.\u201d He added: \u201cBut, public protection has to be at the heart of the duty of any government, and I have to put that first and foremost, when considering first of all existing offenders and secondly the future sentencing regime for terrorists. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get it right and there are questions to be asked about why automatic early release was being deployed.\u201d Asked about the government\u2019s crackdown on 70 or so other people convicted of terrorism offences and released on licence, Buckland said these were being checked to ensure they were keeping to licence conditions, and that these were sufficiently strict. Asked whether he should take into account the victims\u2019 views on rehabilitation, Buckland, a former criminal barrister, said terrorism suspects were \u201ca particularly difficult and complex cohort of people\u201d. On rehabilitating criminals generally, he said: \u201cI have met some who have been capable of rehabilitation and who have managed to move away from crime. But I have met others who have not. And the difficulty here is working out who is capable, and who isn\u2019t.\u201d Saying Labour did not appreciate \u201cthe importance of public protection when it comes to offences of terrorism\u201d, Buckland denied that cuts to court, prison and probation services had a role in what had happened. But speaking to Sky News, Lee said Johnson was \u201cjust pressing buttons\u201d on the subject, saying: \u201dWe know this is the Trump playbook.\u201d Lee said: \u201cThe practical reality is it\u2019s extremely difficult to do that if you haven\u2019t got the prison places. And we never really had enough prison places in all the time I was a justice minister. \u201cYou can address this by investing in it, investing in the courts, particularly investing in probation, because it\u2019s a cycle \u2013 from police, courts, probation. They\u2019ve all got to be working well if you want to reduce crime, reduce pressure on prison, and be able to lock up the people like Usman Khan for much longer, indeed for ever.\u201d Asked about the Conservative response to the attack, Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said politicians should listen to David Merritt: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to open this up, I\u2019m not sure this is the right moment.\u201d He condemned Tory attempts to blame Labour for Khan\u2019s release, saying: \u201cSo it\u2019s perfectly proper to attack Tony Blair, who hasn\u2019t been prime minister since 2007? It\u2019s absolutely ludicrous. They\u2019ve had 10 years to address this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
