More than half a century after his death in 1962, aged just 34, his trademark intense ultramarine blue \u2013 a pigment he saw as bridging the gap between the real world and the sublime through pure colour \u2013 is still officially known as International Klein Blue. This summer the palace will house the most comprehensive UK exhibition of Klein\u2019s work, in what would have been his 90th year. It will include paintings and installation pieces, and classically inspired sculptures such as a version of the Venus de Milo, challenging the antique marbles filling many of the state rooms. \u201cHis attitude to life was that everything was possible as long as you set your mind to it \u2013 a very positive outlook on the world which is perhaps something we need more than ever now,\u201d said the curator Michael Frahm. \u201cHe died too young, but he was hugely hard working, and his work remains highly influential, one of the most original and influential artists of the 20th century.\u201d Frahm is the director of the Blenheim Art Foundation, founded in 2014 by Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill to bring annual exhibitions of contemporary art into the bewilderingly grand formal rooms of his family home. The series has formerly featured living artists and launched with a major exhibition from Ai Weiwei. The Chinese artist was then under house arrest in Beijing but toured the the space to plan the installation through a specially created 3D computer model. The exhibition proved so popular its run had to be extended twice. The 18th-century Oxfordshire palace, designed by Sir John Vanbrugh and set in a landscape designed by the famed gardener Capability Brown, has been a Unesco World Heritage site since 1987. Blenheim was conceived as a gift from the grateful nation to the first Duke of Marlborough for his victories in war, but as the costs escalated dizzyingly funds stopped with \u00a3220,000 spent and the 28,330-sq-metre (seven-acre) house only half completed. It was finished years later when his widow, the formidable Sarah Churchill, sacked the architect and insisted on lower wages and cheaper materials.
