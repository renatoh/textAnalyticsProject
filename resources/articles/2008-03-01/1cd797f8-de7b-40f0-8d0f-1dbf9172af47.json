They won't be actually be great knock knock jokes either, they'll just be taken from the first list that comes up when I type 'knock knock' jokes into google. Yesterday was one of the most disappointing days of sport I can recall. Obviously I'm not talking about the FA Cup here, rather the cricket and the rugby, both of which I was hoping would be competing for space on the front pages, football being relegated, just for a day, to a small column inside the back pages by the brilliant final day of the Test and the epic Calcutta Cup clash. Mmm anyway, I'm in a funk. Minute-by-minute rugby coverage is frankly a bit rubbish isn't it. There aren't nearly enough synonyms for \"kicks the ball downfield\", or \"the ball goes into touch and it is a line-out\". There are two scenarios that might make me enjoy this game: 1) Italy win, only this would kind of be ruined by the effect it would have on the final weekend (it would give Wales the title) so actually scrap that. So, 2) France win by 70 points. That at least would give us a thrilling final Championship match. So yes, all apologies to 'plucky little Italy' but that has to be the only result for me. Not that it really affects us, does it? So far no one has emailed asking for actual coverage. Meaning the last thing I write about this match may be the teams. Not that I'm actually going to write this you understand, I'm going to cut and paste it from somewhere else.

Aaron on the side of caution! 3 min Do you like the way I included exclamation marks for that extra zany entertainment-factor? Italy dominate the first three minutes, running the ball with elan and grace. Then they knock on, and when they win the ball back they knock on again. The French scrum is pathetic. Knock Knock Who's there? Abyssinia! Abyssinia who? Abyssinia behind bars one of these days! 6 min Bergamasco fumbles a catch, knocking the ball back towards his try-line. France swarm on him and win a penalty as he lies on top of the ball. France take the penalty quickly and score a try, and ref Lewis calls them back because Nallet didn't actually manage to tap the ball properly. Which is a startlingly incompetent thing to do. He awards Italy possession and the match meanders back downfield. Knock Knock Who's there? Albee! Albee! Albee a monkey's uncle! 9 min Still waiting for a single email from someone who actually wants me to be providing this service. Bah. Scratch that. Bah bah bah. There at least two people in the world who need me to do this: Jeff Davis is in Thailand and. surprisingly, this isn't big on TV over there, while Chris Drew's kids have \"hijacked the TV for cartoons.\" Sigh. Right, I'll actually do some work then I shall I? 12 min Italy are dominating possession, and doping predictably little with it. \"Do something Italy! Come on do something!\" bellows ref Lewis. They don't, so he penalises them for lying on top of the ball. France win the line-out and drive towards the Italian try-line. That is an abcolutely exceptional try! France 7-0 Italy France push a rolling maul all the way into the Italian 22, and then feed the ball out to the fly-half. He chips the ball over to the left wing, in a neatly executed pre-planned move. There, with a breathtakingly adept skill, the wing Malzieu leaps up and taps the ball back out of the air inside and into the arms of the onrushing full-back, Floch, he dives over for the try. That was better than anything I saw in either game yesterday. 16 min France 7-3 Italy That really was a superb try, forwards and backs working in total harmony, earned by skill, force and brains in equal measure. Marcato has kicked a penalty for Italy though. 20 min \"I guess Katie Price would be a great source of knock knock jokes... PS, have done the deal with the kids - sorry but I get to watch the second half on the TV\" Chris Drew, your joke provides small consoaltion for the fact that I'm about to lose half my audience. Italy hang onto the ball, do absolutely sod all with it. It's a little like watching a series of cows trot into a barn door. 23 min Lewis sets, re-sets, re-sets the scrum again. Then lectures the props in exactly what it is he wants them to do. A great move by Italy sees them break the line at last: the hooker Ghiraldini bursts down the left wing, jinking like Jimmy Johnstone himself, cutting inside and outside the tacklers. Then he off-loads inside, a good pass to Canale, all he has to do is hold the pass and flop over the line. But he drops the ball. Again. France take the ball and run upfield. 26 min Canale again costs Itlay a crucial try with a fumble then, just as he did against Wales. Nick Mallett's reaction on the sidelines is similarly furious. Malzieu takes the ball on the left and runs through one tackle, and over another, before cutting inside the frantically retreating physio, he's an extraordinarily strong man. Unfortunately when Italy finally do bring him down his offload is feeble, and Italy win the scramble to gather the loose ball. 29 min: France 10-3 Italy Jauzion is taken out off the ball by Canale, so France win a penalty which is duly kicked by Yachvili. Knock Knock Who's there? Anne Boleyn! Anne Boleyn who? Anne Boleyn alley! 32 min: France 10-6 Italy. Another penalty by Marcato. An excellent kick in a fiesty wind. And as the commentator so rightly points out: \"The Guiseppe Garibaldi Trophy is still anybodys\". 35 min \"You may be pleasantly surprised by todays game. Two nations throwing the ball around extravagently and running from one end of the pitch to the other... it might just look like a game of rugby..report on, my friend.\" Indeed I will Julian Rose, when I'm not spuriously filling space by publishing your comments. And he's right you know, this is what rugby is supposed to be like: it's actually meant to be fun to watch isn't it? Lord, England are dire. Just another reason to be envious of the French this. 38 min: France 13-6 Italy Yachvili slots another penalty. The breakdown in this match is increasingly resembling an open saloon brawl. The two sides appear to have tired each other a touch... and then as I say that, France gather a kick and burst downfield. Yann David breaks the line and pushes his way into the Italy 22. He's hauled down by Bergamasco, and after he offloads off the floor to Malzieu, France knock on. Oblivious to that is Canale, who charges across the turf and slams a brilliant cover tackle into Diarra who was charging for the try line. Half-time! Cigarette breaks all round. Chris Drew wonders: \"So what are the other reasons for being envious of the French. Can I make some suggestions? Food, cost, health system, trains. I can also think of a few downsides as well...\" The cheese. The wine. The loafing culture. The loaf culture. 43 min BBC is late back to the match because Inverdale was repeating his own favourite knock knock jokes / caught his own reflection in the camera lens and was momentarily blinded by the magnificence of his own barnet / banging on about Sport Relief. France bullock downfield, but are pinged for offside and France kick to the corner for a line-out. 46 min What is big in Thailand, Jeff Davis tells me, is Cardiff v Boro. There are an awful lot of Cardiff fans in Thailand you see. This is all getting a little scrappy I'm afraid. Only because both teams are actually trying to run the ball mind, so it is at least scrappy for the right reasons. 49 min \"Please not the knock knock jokes.\" Pleads Ian Betts, as though I was about to pierce his eyes with hot skewers, \"Am in Mexico trying to understand the direst of losses by England yesterday. Unless you have anything about Scotsmen because in that case, fire away.\" Which direst of losses would that be then? The cricket or the rugby? Understand this: either way, England were directionless, atrocious, dire, woefully lacking in leadership from either their coach or their captain, and generally not worth bothering with, let alone watching or trying to understand. Come on France... show us what we're missing. 52 min: France 18-6 Italy The teams exchange several kicks, prompting the crowd to burst into a huge chorus of boos. That spurs their team into running the ball down the blindside, carrying the ball into contact and the quickly tossing it back to the next runner. And it pays off! Another good try. Yachvili floats a chip kick over the line and Jauzion bursts through the gap, leaps up and catches the ball and tunmbles onto the turf. Yachvili 's kick bounces off the upright. 55 min An old friend writes: \"I don't give a toss about the egg-chasing, but having noted that you again drew the short straw on the live text assignments (who decides these things anyway?) today, I thought I'd pop in and see what was up. Anyway, on the bright side, you could have had Mr Booth's duties last night covering the 'cricket' in Hamilton, so perhaps the OBO/MBM/rugby equivalent gods are beginning to shine on you?\" Three more tries like the two we've seen so far would cheer me up no end, LH Roper, though it'll take more than dodging a night shift to convince me I've the Gods' blessing. 58 min: France 18-13 Italy Try Italy! Bravo! Anyine who knows anything about the game will be very unsurprised to hear that the score came through a catch from the line-out and then a fierce rolling maul, which the French were utterly unable to counter in anyway. It was Martin Castrogiovanni who was at the bottom of the pile of bodies. He celebrates the score by being swiftly substituted for Nieto. Marcato converts and suddenly it is a five-point game. 61 min \"It seemed a bit rich of Clive Woodward to give his damning assessment of Ashton regarding Cipriani and the debacle yesterday. If he wants to make a difference then get back into the game.\" Isn't that the truth Ian Copestake. Woodward, once one of the most impressive administrative minds in British sport, has been systematically trying to ruin his own reputation ever since he stopped working in rugby. Frankly it's bizarre, and getting tedious. Anyway, back in France... Aurelian Rougerie has sprinted won the left wing, he's open and about to cross the try-line when Bergamasco thumps him with a fine cover tackle, rolling Rougerie over on to his back and holding the ball up. What a brilliant tackle that was. The French crowd are furious, but the TMO is quite right. 63 min \"Since we're tripping round the globe just now, letting you know 5Live has let us all down here in Congo. presumably someone else must have the lucrative live online streaming rights for this part of the jungle. Actually it's a relief after Matt Dawson's graceless commentary yesterday.\" Roger Dean has just given me an incredible excuse to shoehorn a link to this - one of my very favourite things of all time - into this commentary. Roger, I need to know: is it true? Is everyone walking around with straws in their mouths and little multi-coloured cartons clutched in their hands? Say it's so! Say it's so! 64 min A French try ends with the ball being picked up and the carrier put into touch. From the ensuing line-out, France attempt a drive, but the move is ruined by the Italian pack. It's another scrum, eight yards out, French put in. And it is a try! Simple flowing stuff, and all the more beautiful to watch because of it. Quick ball from the base of the scrum, on to the 10, on again to Traille, and he just pops the ball on to Rougerie, who steams in on the angle and slices through the Italian line before strolling over for the score. They add the conversion too. 68 min France almost add another from the kick-off as the Italians lapse into total confusion. It was a long kick ahead, and the chasing Traille was denied from gathering it for a simple score only by an unfortunate bounce of the ball. \"Yet, things must be looking up since you seem to have avoided the whole of the wretched Hamilton Test and you seem to have a decent match on here.\" Oh no Lou, I think you just missed my coverage: I was there for the duration of all three of the grim first three days. But yes: this stuff now, which I'm supposed to be writign about right now, is far more entertaining. 70 min Marcato bangs a kick downfield to give Italy momentary respite from the absolute battering that they're taking in the final quarter. Italy throw it around, making little ground until Parisse takes the ball and straightens the line, charging the attack on towards the French try line. Closer and closer they go, out to the left and then... the move dies with a fumble. Scrum France. 74 min Penalty to Italy after France collapse the scrum. \"If Roger Dean is in the Congo does that mean the next Yes cover will have a jungle theme? In other news, forget Umbongo, Kia-Ora rules: \"It's too orangee for crows, it's just for me and my dog!\" Ian Copestake has only gone and linked to my second favourite thing on youtube. What a great afternoon this has turned into now. 77 min Italy's last chance is spoiled by France's ferocious defence. Their attacking scrum is reduced to a pile of bodies and a stray ball, France gather and hoof down field. 80 min Again Rougerie burns his way down the left wing, and is tackled down into touch some five yards out. Play switches over to the right, aand a final push for a try is snuffed out as a grubber rolls into touch. The whistle blows and the match is over. So, the Six Nations is alive going into the final weekend but only just: France will need to beat Wales by 20 points to win the Championship. Thanks for your company, knee-jerk anger at my slack-assed knock knock jokes and emails. We've had no confirmation about the beverage situation in the Congo from Roger Dean, so my dream is alive and well. I'm off to buy a beret, a string of onions and a wheel of camembert in good time for next Saturday. Allez France."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
