The headgear might be tried out as early as the Dante Stakes at York next week. Mark Johnston's colt looked to have pace-setting Sohaib in his sights at the end of the Classic trial, but then seemed to be intimidated by Sohaib's more positive attitude and could not get past Barry Hills's charge, who was giving his trainer an amazing 11th success in the race. Sohaib, who is not entered in the Derby, survived a stewards inquiry after a bumping match with Sir George Turner close home. \"There is nothing special for him at the moment, but I think we will stick to a mile and a quarter,\" said Hills. The result caused barely a ripple in Derby betting. Ladbrokes were the only firm to shorten Sir George Turner - from 40-1 to 33-1 - representative Mike Dillon justifying the decision by saying: \"It was the colt's seasonal debut and you never know, blinkers could do the trick.\" Johnston explained: \"Sir George Turner likes to have plenty of space and when the other horse rolled towards him I think he just got a bit nervous. I know it's not always popular over here to try blinkers, but in the Kentucky Derby last week there were plenty sporting them.\" At last year's corresponding meeting jockey Darryll Holland had to have a police escort to leave the track after dropping his hands on Island House in the mile and a quarter Listed contest and getting beaten by Adilabad. Holland was desperate not to incur punters' wrath a second time and rode a blinder in the Ormonde Stakes, making every post a winning one on Geoff Wragg's St Expedit. St Expedit is the very model of the perfect Chester horse. As Holland said on dismounting \"He goes round here like he's part of a Scalextric set.\" With the confidence of that victory under his belt, Holland went out to lay his own particular ghost, but he was obviously very uptight and it showed in his demeanour throughout. Island House was sent off the 4-6 favourite and trailed the field for the first part of the event. Kieren Fallon, Holland's bete noire 12 months before on Adi labad, was riding Tough Speed on this occasion and angled out to make Island House go the long way round him. Fearing another debacle, Holland rousted up his mount to make sure he got by and, with the jockey rivals having their own race, veteran Pat Eddery stole a march on Freefourinternet, eventually beating Island House by a length. Tough Speed ended up third, a length and a quarter farther back. Holland did not need an escort to leave this time, but he did not get a cheering throng greeting him either. Wragg, full of praise for Holland when he won on St Expedit, would not criticise the rider, however. \"The ground was a bit firm for Island House and he didn't quicken up. I don't think it was the jockey's fault,\" he said. Holland gave up his later ride as he was dehydrated, but Eddery went on to complete a 260-1 double on Aker Wood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
