Bradshaw \u2013 who has repeatedly raised the subject of Kremlin interference in British politics, including in the EU referendum \u2013 received the email at his election gmail address. The sender \u2013 \u201cAndrei\u201d \u2013 claimed he was a whistleblower from inside Vladimir Putin\u2019s presidential administration. The email contained several apparently genuine documents. They showed how the Kremlin has set up a secret \u201cfake news unit\u201d in Russia\u2019s far east region which is used to suppress negative stories and to boost pro-government sentiment. However, two of the documents carried malicious code. Bradshaw initially sent the email to cyber-experts, who confirmed that the files were suspicious. He has now reported the email to the national cyber security centre (NCSC) \u2013 a part of GCHQ \u2013 and to parliamentary authorities. The NCSC confirmed it was examining the case on Tuesday, saying: \u201cThe NCSC works closely with political parties, local authorities and individuals and offers them access to the best cybersecurity guidance and support. We were recently contacted by Mr Bradshaw and are currently looking at the information we have received.\u201d Intelligence professionals said the attack was technically sophisticated and specifically designed to target the prospective Labour candidate. The files include the signature of a genuine regional envoy on presidential notepaper and a detailed PowerPoint slide in Russian of protest meetings, seemingly compiled by Putin\u2019s FSB spy agency. Bradshaw said: \u201cThe email came to my gmail account, which is more vulnerable than my parliamentary one. What the sender was claiming was potentially extremely useful and political dynamite. It was drafted in a clever way to make it tempting to open.\u201d Asked why the Russians might want target him, he said: \u201cI was the first MP to raise Russia\u2019s role in the Brexit vote in 2016. Ever since I have been asking questions about the Kremlin\u2019s subversion of our democracy.\u201d The email was written in good English, with several of the original Russian documents helpfully translated. It was sent from an anonymous account using ProtonMail, an encrypted email provider. The sender \u201cAndrei\u201d said he wanted to leak details of the propaganda pilot project because similar \u201cfake news practices\u201d were used \u201cwith Brexit and the US\u201d in 2016 \u2013 a reference to the Kremlin\u2019s social media operation in support of the leave campaign and Donald Trump. \u201cAndrei\u201d wrote: \u201cLessons are to reapplied in 2020. Since you are campaigning for the general election, maybe you would be interested in being first to break the story? \u201cMy motivation for contacting you is that I personally object to the methods my bosses in the Russian Presidential Administration are using \u2026 They value the current state of affairs that allows them to store money in the UK, as you know, so an expos\u00e9 could create a strong correct reaction in Moscow.\u201d The sender said his documents might be \u201cpolitical capital\u201d for Labour before the election, adding: \u201cEspecially considering the recent articles about the Conservatives operating with Russia money.\u201d Bradshaw said the suspected cyber-attack was further confirmation that Moscow was seeking to influence British politics. He condemned Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to publish the intelligence and security committee\u2019s report on Moscow interference and said the prime minister had yet to come clean on his links with wealthy Russians living in the UK. \u201cJohnson has repeatedly lied about this. He hasn\u2019t told the truth about his own contacts. That\u2019s one of the reasons he doesn\u2019t want the report published before the election because of what it contains,\u201d Bradshaw said. Earlier this year, US special counsel Robert Mueller said Russia had conducted a \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d operation to support Trump in the 2016 election. Mueller indicted several individuals from the notorious St Petersburg \u201ctroll factory\u201d, which was also used to push pro-Brexit messaging in advance of the EU referendum vote. Last year parliament\u2019s digital, culture, media and sport select committee said Moscow had used \u201cmalign digital influence campaigns\u201d in Britain, including after the novichok poisoning in Salisbury of Sergei Skripal. The committee took issue with Downing Street\u2019s claim there was no evidence of \u201csuccessful\u201d Russian interference and said it should investigate. Over the summer, suspected hackers from Moscow\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency launched a sophisticated attack on around 30 western journalists and Russia experts. The attack involved phishing emails sent to ProtonMail accounts, similar to the one used last week to contact Bradshaw. News of the apparent attack on Bradshaw followed claims on Monday that a leaked dossier of US-UK trade documents published by the Labour party had been initially shared online using methods that mirrored those previously used as part of a Russian disinformation campaign. There is no suggestion either that the NHS documents, produced by Jeremy Corbyn at a dramatic press conference last week, were fake. But the consultancy Graphika said that the cache of files was initially distributed via Reddit, three German-language websites and an anonymous Twitter account, in a manner similar to a previous operation by a Russian group known as Secondary Infektion. The researcher who first raised the prospect of foreign involvement in the Labour leak, Ben Nimmo, said on Tuesday that it would require information from Twitter or Reddit to fully resolve whether Russia was involved. Without such a development, the links were \u201cnot enough to provide conclusive attribution\u201d, Nimmo admitted. Secondary Infektion, which acted in the same manner to the individual or group that leaked the trade documents, was identified only when Facebook used its behind-the-scenes knowledge to cite Russia as the source."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
