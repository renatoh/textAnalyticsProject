I certainly don't expect them to enjoy their marketing being undermined by an independent journalist, but you have to wonder why they can't manage to retain at least a dignified fa\u00e7ade. \"Another Schofield rant\" says the subheading in \"What the papers say\", with reference to a comment piece in last week's Media Guardian. Of course, they could have informed the trade that pays them that I am much more in favour of digital radio's development than they seem to be, despite their name. I want it to develop into DAB+ as soon as possible, rather than hang on to creaky old DAB. This is even more important if \"new figures showed DAB listening figures have been on the decline for the last three months,\" as Broadcast said, and 13.5% of people are now listening via their mobile phones. While I'm grateful to the DRDB for raising my profile and sending me more readers, making it personal is always a good indictor that they're not coping with the facts. But I expect I'm easier to slag off than the likes of Kelvin McKenzie (\"DAB was, is and will be a disaster\") or Scott Taunton, managing director of UTV Media GB, which runs TalkSport, who told Media Guardian: \"DAB is not necessarily a next-generation service,\" says Taunton. \"There is already DAB-plus, and in order to launch DAB-plus in the UK you would have to make the vast bulk of DAB sets redundant. The future at the moment is FM \u2013 the next generation is about iPhones with FM receivers.\" While I love the idea that I'm capable of bringing the DAB radio industry to its knees -- which would make me more powerful than the BBC and its pro-DAB advertising -- that's just a fantasy. The reality is that the world market is starting to abandon DAB, it hasn't really taken off with British consumers (especially not in cars), and some radio insiders are now airing their own doubts about any over-hasty switchover. The DRDB says: \"Schofield ignores the fact that most of the formats he cites are already covered by new chip sets that can easily handle DAB, DAB+ and DMB, as well as FM and AM.\" Well, I did point out that the World DAB Forum had agreed a new DAB+ standard and changed its name to WorldDMB (I can understand why it wouldn't want DAB in its name) and I'm wholly in favour of the WorldDMB standard. As a heavy radio consumer, I'd be perfectly happy with \"DAB+ done right\". Where I part company with the British radio industry is that they've sold UK consumers millions of radio sets that do not follow the WorldDMB standard, nor can the bulk of those sets be upgraded to DAB+. Will the DRDB tell the British public that they should not buy DAB sets unless they have these great \"new chip sets that can easily handle DAB, DAB+ and DMB, as well as FM and AM\" (and, by the way, should ideally be upgradeable). Don't hold your breath. The DRDB also says: \"Schofield seems to suggest ditching all other means of digital radio delivery in favour of Internet radio.\" In this case, \"seems to suggest\" should be read as \"doesn't suggest\". My unforgivable thought-crime is simply to argue that the British radio industry should follow the lead of many other countries and the World DAB Forum: admit that DAB isn't up to snuff and announce plans to move to DAB+. The point I made at the end of my Friday post, Flogging a DAB horse, is that the world is changing. The BBC didn't seriously think about Internet radio streams replacing broadcast radio in the early 1990s, when DAB was being developed, and it's true that, for most people, Wi-Fi radio isn't a replacement today. In another 20 years, however, the world will be a different place. I am prepared to imagine that people may prefer access to tens of thousands of high-sound-quality streams over the much smaller number of low-sound-quality stations available on DAB. The rapid pace of change is something that computing has lived with for 50 years. It must come as a terrible shock to the radio industry, but frankly, they won't have a future at all if they don't figure out how to cope with change. Or, indeed, criticism. As always, I don't care whether Internet streaming takes over the radio industry or not. If millions of people like the idea and buy Wi-Fi radio sets and Slingboxes and portable internet whatnots, then it will, and if they don't, it won't. Neither of those outcomes will make any difference to me, because I can wring just as many words out of \"Wi-Fi radio wins\" as I can get out of \"Wi-Fi radio flops\". I have no obligation to go down with the Titanic. If my job ultimately boiled down to flogging DAB radios, then I might take a different view. Which might be why the DRDB seems to be angry with me, whereas I just feel sorry for them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
