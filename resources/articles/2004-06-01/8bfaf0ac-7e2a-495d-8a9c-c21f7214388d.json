Yesterday it would have been better advised to alert the Met Office to the strange micro-climate of West Sussex which allowed almost a full day's play. While the south coast was pelted with rain and buffeted by gales, cricket continued here until after 5pm and the Gloucestershire seamer Jon Lewis, bowling in the worst conditions he said he had encountered in nine seasons, took five for 33 to bundle Sussex out for 106 . Umpire Roy Palmer twice pointed out that Lewis had run down the wicket in his follow-through but accepted the 14-stone bowler's excuse that he had been blown off course. With ferries being cancelled down the road in Portsmouth, it seemed reason enough. All around the ground grey clouds were dumping rain and fallen trees blocking roads. Earlier the ground staff had cleared broken branches and retrieved runaway advertising hoardings, but play started only 30 minutes late. Immediately Lewis had Ian Ward caught by Mark Alleyne at second slip. Eight overs later, after Palmer's panama had been fielded at square leg, Richard Montgomerie edged to Alex Gidman and Sussex went to their first rain break on 40 for two. They were off barely 20 minutes - Palmer returning without his hat - and soon Chris Adams had gone. The Sussex captain was hit on the pad by Mike Smith and backheeled the ball on to his leg stump. Next Shabbir Ahmed, playing his last game before returning to the warmth of Pakistan, was horribly wide with a short delivery. Matthew Prior chased it and Stephen Adshead took the first of four catches. Murray Goodwin, top scorer with a sensible 28, became Lewis's third victim thanks to an excellent catch by Gidman and Tim Ambrose the fourth when he flashed at a ball which was leaving him. Robin Martin-Jenkins also went with a waft and Mushtaq Ahmed steered to backward point, both off Alleyne, and at that point - with Sussex 77 for eight, just past their lowest score in Arundel - Gloucestershire had not dropped a thing. All was to change. Either side of two breaks for drizzle Mohammad Akram was put down four times in the slips, and with James Kirtley he pushed the score to 99 before Lewis returned and picked up Kirtley with his first ball. Jason Lewry backed so far away that Smith got barely a cheer for his second wicket and, as if to prove a point, the sun shone briefly before Craig Spearman and Philip Weston opened the Gloucestershire innings. Fourteen overs later the miracle ended. With rain again in the air, Gloucestershire were offered the light and a handful of spectators headed for their cars. \u00b7 At New Road, play started at 4pm and only seven overs were possible - long enough for Worcestershire to remove Surrey's Mark Butcher and Mark Ramprakash. Butcher was out to a diving catch at the wicket off Kabir Ali. Ramprakash, sent back by Scott Newman, was run out by a direct throw from Gareth Batty in the covers. Surrey, put in to bat, were 16 for two when rain ended play."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
