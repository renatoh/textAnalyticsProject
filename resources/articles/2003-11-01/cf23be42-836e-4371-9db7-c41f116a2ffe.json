Written by a host of experts in the field and lusciously illustrated by award-winning underwater photographers, it provides a comprehensive picture of the most exceptional diving the oceans have to offer. It profiles and maps leading dive sites in a range of locations, from the warm-water reefs of the remote Similan Islands in Thailand's Andaman Sea, to the wrecks lying deep off Scapa Flow, in Orkney, with a section on each describing the underwater geography, marine life and average depth. An index provides practicalities, such as the best time to go, likely visibility, and whether it is good for snorkelling. Local experts have also researched the availability of hire equipment, whether pre-booking is required and the need for permits. Compiled by Jackson, an industrial chemist-turned dive expedition leader and fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, it is big on conservation, with tips on eco-friendly diving and the ethics of feeding to attract sharks. The only drawback, however, is that what it gains by being comprehensive, it loses in detail. For instance, the Blue Hole in Dahab is one of northern Egypt's most legendary sites, but it merits only a passing mention. Nevertheless, it is an informative guide to diving some of the most exquisite places on earth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
