Not since 1995 have Manchester United lost at Villa Park in the league and a combination of Cristiano Ronaldo's brilliance and an outstanding goal from Paul Scholes ensured that run did not come to an end. Victory gives United 47 points, a total that after 19 games of the season has never failed to bring the title. Ferguson might not have been aware of that statistic but he did not need anyone to point out the significance of United's position. 'Perhaps that shows we shouldn't believe Jose Mourinho,' said the United manager. 'He said Chelsea would be top at Christmas and they're not. He had to apologise this week about lying about an Everton player [Andrew Johnson] so perhaps he should apologise again.' United had failed to find any rhythm against an obdurate Aston Villa side in the first half, but the shackles were removed in spectacular style after the interval. Ronaldo ran from inside his own half to score 13 minutes after the restart, before Scholes thundered an unstoppable volley in off the underside of the crossbar to seal victory moments later. The latter goal prompted Edwin van der Sar to run to the halfway line to celebrate, such was the majesty of the strike. With Villa now reeling, United inflicted a final blow five minutes from time, Ronaldo finishing off a move that had started with Ryan Giggs on the edge of the Villa penalty area. It was a moment that confirmed United's second-half superiority, with the visitors' exhilarating ability to turn defence into attack draining the last traces of belief from Martin O'Neill's embattled side. It is now seven matches since Villa last won, a sequence that has checked the momentum that followed the manager's arrival. With fixtures against Spurs on Boxing Day and the visit of Chelsea following a trip to Charlton, the festive period promises to bring Villa little cheer. On this evidence, Sir Alex Ferguson can anticipate a much better return. He could afford to leave Wayne Rooney on the substitutes' bench, a family bereavement earlier in the week cited as the reason for Ferguson resting his most penetrative player, and still win at a canter. Not that Ferguson was in danger of getting carried away by this success. The United manager showed he has lost none of his hunger when he subjected Giggs to the infamous hairdryer. United were already two goals to the good when the Welshman, in possession on the left flank, attempted to pick out Louis Saha with a crossfield ball instead of the more obvious pass to Ronaldo. Ferguson's face took on a distinctly purple hue as he stepped out of his touchline area to berate Giggs with a verbal barrage. Later Ferguson would offer much more welcoming words about Ronaldo. 'He was a revelation,' said Ferguson. The Portuguese was the game's outstanding performer, his superb skill allied to searing pace brutally exposed Villa's defensive frailties. Indeed at times it was tempting to feel sorry for Villa's right-back, Aaron Hughes, who was probably left feeling he had twisted blood on more than one occasion as Ronaldo wreaked havoc. It says much for Ronaldo that during a lacklustre first-half display from United, he was the one player who looked threatening in possession. Villa might even have gone ahead early on, but Craig Gardner's header, after Chris Sutton flicked on Gareth Barry's free-kick, came back off the upright. The home side were posing problems at that point, with Gabriel Agbonlahor's willing running upsetting the United defence. Ferguson admitted that he was 'worried' by 'Villa's energy' in the opening 45 minutes, when Gavin McCann and Gardner snapped into tackles, but the United manager's fears would be swiftly allayed. Ronaldo, picking up possession inside his own half, strode purposefully forward before sashaying across the Villa area and firing a shot that struck Gary Cahill. The rebound dropped at the Portuguese's feet and this time he struck a vicious drive inside Gabor Kiraly's near post to notch United's 2,000th goal under Ferguson. 'It was the turning point in the game,' said O'Neill. 'We lost our shape after that and they punished us with a terrific second goal.' The 'terrific goal' belonged to Scholes, whose response to McCann's clearing header was to propel a thundering 20-yard volley beyond Kiraly. From then on United were playing exhibition football, with the third and final goal emblematic of the ease with which victory was achieved. Giggs initiated the attack before Scholes, Rooney and Neville combined to find Ronaldo, the mercurial winger tapping in at the far post in front of the United fans. Man of the match: Cristiano Ronaldo The Portuguese was outstanding, his two goals thoroughly deserved on an afternoon when he again silenced the away fans' taunts. His movement and skill proved too much for Villa, and the ease with which he tore upfield to put United ahead said much about the confidence coursing through his play."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
