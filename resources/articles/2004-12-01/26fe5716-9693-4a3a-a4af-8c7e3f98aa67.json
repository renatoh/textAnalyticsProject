A government agreement has more than doubled the number of flights permitted between the two countries, and Virgin and BMI have been given permission to enter the market for the first time. Previously, BA operated 19 flights a week, which they will now be allowed to increase to 26 (increasing services to Madras, and starting a new route to Bangalore). Virgin has been awarded 10 flights a week to Delhi and Mumbai, and BMI four to Mumbai. Each airline requested a bigger share of the 21 new routes and all are considering appealing against the verdict. Virgin, which operated a code share with Air India, has started its own flights to Delhi (from \u00a3585 return inclusive). BA and BMI are due to launch their services next summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
