The manager said Russia's opening goal ought to have been disallowed for offside, he bemoaned the misfortune of their heavily deflected third and said things would have been different had Robbie Keane's cross-cum-shot not bounced back off the crossbar. The little details, Trapattoni's favourite phrase, had simply conspired against him. In many respects, this was vintage Trapattoni. Talk up the positives, skirt around the difficult questions. Keep the faith, was the booming message. He also pointed out that in two years under his charge and methods, this was a first defeat in a qualifying group fixture. Confidence ought not to be shaken ahead of Tuesday's trip to Slovakia, which has assumed tremendous significance. The trouble was that Trapattoni was fooling nobody. There was no disgrace in losing to a Russia team that purred like a high-performance engine and boasted players of far greater technical ability. Indeed, Ireland's spirited late rally, in which they scored twice and hinted at an implausible equaliser, could be admired. Yet it did not conceal the wider issue which was that Trapattoni is no closer to adding sophistication and flexibility to his gameplan. His argument is that with relatively limited means, he has needed to cut his cloth accordingly. He regularly name-drops Michel Platini and Zbigniew Boniek, his favourite creative players from his days at Juventus, and reminds people he has no such options in his current employment. Hence, the two defensive midfielders in the middle of his 4-4-2 formation, the men behind the ball and the reliance on set pieces for offensive inspiration. It becomes fiendishly difficult for Ireland when they concede the first goal. Like the counterattacking boxer forced to step on to the front foot when behind on points, Trapattoni's team can look uncertain and uncoordinated. The problem is more pronounced in home matches; Ireland's best performances under the Italian have come, almost exclusively, on the road, when opponents are more inclined to bring the game to them. This has offered them hope for the Slovakia tie. Against Russia, Ireland resorted to lumping high balls forward over the midfield, where the visitors had an extra man for most of the game and dominated. The tactic was not without success \u2013 it helped to expose Russia's vulnerable underbelly and led to both of the late goals \u2013 but the feeling persists that it was more down to luck than judgment. Some of Ireland's players said if they played like that in Slovakia, they would be sure to lose. The defender Richard Dunne articulated the frustration most eloquently. \"As soon as Shay Given gets it, we all turn our backs and run forward and see if Kevin Doyle can head it or what else Kevin can do,\" Dunne said. \"As a team, we've got to help each other out a bit more and we've got to look to get the ball. \"At the moment, we are just going forward and defending, going forward and defending. We're never going to control games if we play like that. We've got to try and get our foot on the ball at some stage and string five or six passes together and create chances that way, rather than from set pieces or long balls all the time. \"We proved we can do it against France in Paris in the World Cup play-off but we've not followed up on it. Whether it was a one-off or a fluke or whether we can do it on a regular basis \u2026 we still haven't proved that.\" Trapattoni did replace Doyle with Keith Fahey, bring Aiden McGeady inside and play a 4-2-3-1 formation for the last 20 minutes. McGeady said that the switch saw Ireland \"get a lot more chances and Russia didn't have much time on the ball.\" Change, though, continues to resemble anathema to Trapattoni. He will stick with his 4-4-2 in Slovakia, having suggested that he could not think about dropping either Keane or Doyle, who are arguably his key players. He seems reluctant to ask Keane to start in a deeper role. Dunne was asked what Trapattoni had said to the players at half-time, when they trailed 2-0; what had he sought to change? \"Not a lot,\" he replied. \"We had a gameplan at the start and we tried to continue that. Then, they scored again.\" Slovakia must also seek to bounce back on Tuesday, having been surprisingly beaten in Armenia on Friday. They will be without three key players \u2014 the suspended defender Martin Skrtel and the injured strikers Robert Vittek and Miroslav Stoch. Trapattoni is considering \"one or two\" changes in response to fatigue but the fundamentals will stay the same. The 71-year-old remains convinced that they are the only way forward. Others have become worried."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
