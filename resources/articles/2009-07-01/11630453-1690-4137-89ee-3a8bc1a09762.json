It was a radio special, recorded at the Radio Festival in Nottingham, and tackled the big questions about the medium in the current, trying financial climate. Is DAB the right future for radio? How can the commercial sector survive? What will happen to community radio stations when analogue is switched off? We heard from thrilling stations around Nottingham, catering for niche audiences: Progress Radio addresses gay, lesbian and transgender listeners, while Dawn Radio caters for a faith-based audience. Listeners pay a subscription, and the payback promise is quite something: a jingle promises \"unimaginable rewards from Allah\". Commentators, including Paul Gambaccini and Kelvin Mackenzie, provided quips. For Mackenzie, DAB will only work if it can be cheaply available in cars. \"The idea that you have to talk to the missus all the way to Bournemouth is preposterous,\" he suggested. Host Steve Hewlett set the scene well, saying, \"after a big old industry knees-up last night, it's not a pretty sight\". This fascinating half-hour reminded us that radio is loved, and full of talent; how to harness these two things, and still run viable businesses, though, were issues inevitably left somewhat unresolved."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
