It is therefore particularly worrying, for women globally, that the Home Office does not believe rapes and beatings amount to persecution (Children live in fear after mother is deported, October 12). As one of the most common weapons of war, rape is used to destroy those seen as ethnically and religiously different. We must make provision for asylum seekers who are victims of rape, struggling to include this as grounds for asylum. How the government feels it is appropriate to separate a mother from her children and send her to a country where she could be raped again and possibly killed is astonishing. Attitudes towards women still have to undergo fundamental change to ensure that rape is viewed as a serious, high-risk crime for the perpetrator.
