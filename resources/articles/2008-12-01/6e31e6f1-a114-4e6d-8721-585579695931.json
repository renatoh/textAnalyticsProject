Aside from volunteer work benefiting the lonely and hungry souls ignored by the seasonal convulsions of thoughtless consumerism, there really isn't a better cure for this annual solipsistic orgy than a good read. Of course, if you enjoy Tiny Tim's chirrups, it's certainly your right to salivate over the reading equivalent of Silver Bells played for the 429th time. But real Christmas stories rail against predictability, daring to expose the bare branches of a wintry wonderland and offering a dutiful tonic to the stench of faux brotherhood. O Henry, a master of the ironic short story, understood Christmas's desperate qualities all too well. He depicted the heartbreaking realities of superficial gift-giving in his famous short story, The Gift of the Magi. For a mere $20, Della shears off one of the two possessions that her husband takes mighty pride in, with Della's husband offering the worst possible gift in return. Could the story's indelible climax have occurred on any other day of the year? Terry Pratchett's 20th Discworld novel, Hogfather, is greatly indebted to EE Cummings's successful 1946 play Santa Claus: A Morality, but it tackles the mythos through its titular character, who drives a sleigh pulled by four gargantuan pigs. The Hogfather disappears, and this unexpected absence, effected by ominous forces, permits Death to step into the red suit. Pratchett then proceeds to satirise the folly of false belief, while also taking a moment to eviscerate the hallowed carol, Good King Wenceslas. It can't be an accident that David Sedaris got his first big break when he read his essay, SantaLand Diaries, in which he describes his anxieties at fending off children and frenetic parents while working as an elf at the age of 33, on US public radio. \"I'm wearing a green velvet costume,\" wrote Sedaris. \"It doesn't get any worse than this.\" The satirist Christopher Moore went further in his absurdist novel, The Stupidest Angel. Others have remained silent about the horrific peals of overly aggressive Salvation Army bellringers, but Moore is far from diffident. His Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror features a Santa killed by a shovel, and hedges its bets on a seven-year-old who hopes that Santa's resurrection will save Christmas. Even bestselling author John Grisham couldn't resist taking a pop at the holiday's inescapable influence in his 2002 novella, Skipping Christmas, which depicted a family fleeing the season on a Caribbean cruise \u2013 although even such an iconoclastic plan cannot prevent them from attempting to keep up with the Joneses. This representative bundle suggests that literary objections certainly aren't sleeping in heavenly peace. But given the proliferation of cinematic anti-Christmas gems, one wonders why the novel, which remains a medium of many possibilities, hasn't afforded still more efforts to tell the cold hard truth about the holidays."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
