Thank you all for joining in; you are the chorus line every liveblogger needs, and let\u2019s face it you\u2019ve been making me look good for years. See you next week! We get to see Alex and Neil\u2019s best bits, and they both say lovely things about each other as it all gets a bit emotional. They take to the floor for their final dance, to Circle Of Life from The Lion King. Which means ALEX AND NEIL are leaving Strictly. I\u2019m sad about this, but much as I think \u2018gospel hiphop samba\u2019 should be a dance genre we ALL embrace in future, it was pretty risky for the quarter final. So how will the judges vote? Craig saves Alex and Neil, as does Motsi. Good work both. Bruno saves Chris and Karen, however, which gives Shirley the deciding vote. Shirley saves Chris and Karen, based on \u2018personal taste\u2019 \u2013 she thought their dance had more content and was more entertaining. I mean it definitely had content, it just wasn\u2019t FOXTROT content. FFS Shirley. Alex and Neil are up next \u2013 it\u2019s definitely could have done with more Samba content, but Alex actually dances this really well. I\u2019m not sure she can blamed for the lack of Samba, she didn\u2019t choreograph it. If it were me, based on that dance, I\u2019d keep Alex and Neil over Chris and Karen. Dance-off time! First up it\u2019s Chris and Karen, and their \u2018Foxtrot\u2019. This is much like last night, other than the timing is worse and the bits in hold are even more lethargic. Not a great performance, and it may well finish Chris off. Well, this is interesting \u2013 a battle of the non-dancers doing dances with limited relevant content. Alex and Neil scored one point fewer last night, but I\u2019d argue they\u2019ve made more progress overall this series. It really is going to come down to this one dance \u2013 personally I\u2019d love to see Alex and Neil stay, but I know there are plenty out there who are very much team Chris and Karen. So who is joining Chris and Karen in the dance off? Kelvin and Oti are safe, which means ALEX AND NEIL are in the bottom two. Next week is TWO DANCES. Farewell technique, we barely knew you. Loving Idina\u2019s red pantsuit, it\u2019s fabulous. Dance-wise, Idina is accompanied by Giovanni and Karen contempo-wafting, but only Karen is barefoot. Brr. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Idina Menzel. For those of you who have been on a different planet these last few years, Idina is the voice of Elsa from Frozen. Tonight she is singing \u2018Seasons Of Love\u2019 from Rent, and also her new festive album. So will this reflect tonight\u2019s bottom two? Karim and Amy are safe, along with Emma and Anton. First couple in the bottom two: CHRIS AND KAREN. If they\u2019re up against Kelvin and Oti, they\u2019re toast. If it\u2019s Alex and Neil, it could go either way. Meanwhile lowlights were Chris and Karen\u2019s Oliver! Foxtrot, which looked fun but lacked actual Foxtrot, and Alex and Neil\u2019s Sister Act 2 Samba which was joyful joyful to watch but was a bit hiphop heavy and Samba lite. Last night on Strictly: Musicals Week! I\u2019ve watched all the dances again this morning (with both eyes, such a novelty!) \u2013 highlights were Kelvin and Oti\u2019s Beauty and The Beast American Smooth, which was pure Gaston perfection, Karim and Amy\u2019s Hairspray Jive, which got Craig\u2019s first ten out, and Emma and Anton\u2019s Throughly Modern Millie Charleston, which was their best dance by far despite Anton not really keeping up. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a derelict post box, Claudia in a black velvet sack. Don\u2019t forget your letters to Santa. Dance-wise, it\u2019s midnight blue organza contempo-waft. But not barefoot, winter has finally arrived. This is splendid. And we\u2019re off! Tonight\u2019s musical opener is Beverley Knight, singing Memory from Cats. Based on Facebook photos, it would seem I have an uncle who is good friends with Beverley Knight. I\u2019ve never properly got to the bottom of this family link but probably should, because she is amazing. Missed the Countryfile Casual Weather earlier, but the comments tell me that it was a solid effort from the excellent Darren Bett. Good work Darren, you can come to our Strictly Casual Christmas party. Evening all, and welcome back for this week\u2019s quarter final results! Last night was a fun show, but if we\u2019re ever going to make it to Christmas we need to send another couple off into the Strictly sunset. I don\u2019t make the rules. Based on last night\u2019s dancing, it should be a Chris/Karen vs. Alex/Neil dance-off, but we can\u2019t underestimate the power of the public vote, particularly where Chris is concerned. Of course there were a few other factors at play last last night, like not being able to vote, being able to vote 412 times, not being sure if you\u2019d actually voted, and having no idea who you\u2019d actually voted for. LOVE a bit of live TV voting chaos. Kick off is at 7.20pm \u2013 I see there were some spoilers down below which the moderators had removed by the time I woke up this morning. Can people please not do this? It\u2019s selfish and inconsiderate and makes me cross. See you in a bit! Thanks so much for joining in tonight and being hilarious down below as always \u2013 I\u2019m off to eat pizza whilst reading your comments. We\u2019re back here tomorrow night from 7.20pm for the Results Show, so please join me back here then! Hx *CURTAIN FALLS, HOUSE LIGHTS GO UP* Goodness, the dancing\u2019s over! That was quick. The lines are open, so get voting for your faves. Kelvin, Karim and Emma are very much centre stage this week, whilst Alex and Chris are propping up the chorus. Surely those two have to be in the dance off tomorrow? Time for a recap \u2013 my favourite performances this evening was definitely Kelvin and Oti, but it was a pretty epic show all round. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Emma and Anton. The tens have gone WILD this evening. Shirley thought Emma fast-tracked her way to the final \u2013 it was fantastic. Bruno liked that it was a genuine 1920\u2019s Charleston, Emma was a perfect high-class flapper. Craig loved the swivel \u2013 it was classic, classy and fab-u-lous. Motsi thought Emma was the icing on the top of a fantastic evening. Good to see the Flavia wig having an outing, it\u2019s been in its tiny cage too long. Emma has great swivel and characterisation in this dance, it could be strongly argued that she\u2019s out-dancing Anton right now. I absolutely loathe this kind of musical number, but Emma is smashing it. Enjoyed that very much. And finally tonight it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON! This week they\u2019re dancing the Charleston to \u2018Thoroughly Modern Millie\u2019, which is the only musical in this year\u2019s clutch that I haven\u2019t seen on either stage or screen. Having watched a bit on YouTube, it seems to be heavy Jazz Hands, which is definitely Emma and Anton\u2019s happy place. Scores: 10,10,10,10 \u2013 a top score of 40 for Karim and Amy. DRINK. Motsi hands Karim her ten paddle and gives him a hug. Shirley thought it was a flawless performance with high quality technique. Bruno has shivers going down his spine \u2013 it was a mind-blowing, bravura performance and the best Jive they\u2019ve ever seen on Strictly. Craig is forced to give a standing ovation \u2013 tens all round? Karim is rocking the Corny Collins white suit, whilst Amy has a kind of fringy chessboard thing going on, along with weird hair horns. Karim is very much in his element here, some nice kicks and flicks and lovely timing. Is is (as ever) all a bit frantic, but an extraordinary Jive by any standards. I think my biggest issue with this couple is the lack of chemistry \u2013 Karim looks like he\u2019s doing his own thing and Amy is just making up the numbers. Just me? Next up it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! Their Musicals Week choice is a Jive to \u2018You Can\u2019t Stop the Beat\u2019 from Hairspray. How has Karim got this far without doing a Jive? This kind of technical detail dance is very Karim, so have high hopes for this after last week\u2019s angsty Couple\u2019s Choice. For those of you reading but not watching, sorry for the lack of photos so far, they don\u2019t appear to be on the system yet. I\u2019ll add them as soon as I can. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Kelvin and Oti. Craig thought the timing in the Viennese section was a bit off, but fantastic characterisation and a brilliant dance. Motsi thought we saw all of Kelvin\u2019s skills come together, it was beautiful and elegant and Kelvin did a great job. Shirley thought it was outstanding on so many levels, and she absolutely disagrees with Craig on the timing. Bruno thought Kelvin had flair, pizzazz and a touch of camp \u2013 the character, storytelling and timing were perfect. Kelvin looks oddly like Howard Donald from Take That, I can\u2019t get past it. There is however lots of furniture in this dance, so DRINK. Lovely footwork from Kelvin, and he\u2019s doing a great job of capturing the spirit of Gaston. This has got all kinds going on, and I absolutely love it. AGAIN. It\u2019s time for KELVIN AND OTI! This week they\u2019re dancing the American Smooth to \u2018Gaston\u2019 from Beauty and the Beast. I mean, Kelvin is just a pair of sideburns away from being actual Gaston, so this is an amazing choice. Please let this be as spectacularly camp as the original. Scores: 6,7,7,7 \u2013 a total of 27 for Alex and Neil. Bruno thought it was a street/commercial Samba, and it didn\u2019t have the right bounce in the traditional Samba sections, so Bruno can\u2019t really judge them on that. Craig quite likes weird positions and really enjoyed it, whilst Motsi thought they were having the time of their life, even thought she wanted more Samba. Shirley loved the personality from the waist upwards, but there was too much repetition and not enough Samba. In summary: not enough Samba. Sadly neither Alex or Neil are dressed as nuns, but there are some nice purple robes going one. Oh hang on, they\u2019ve gone \u2013 now Alex is ready for a spot of decorating and somebody from 1983 appears to have been sick on Neil\u2019s shirt. Alex is doing her best to give this some Samba bounce, but the trainers are hampering her frame and her neck appears to have disappeared. This is also a hip-hop Samba with very little Latin flavour, and whilst Alex appears to be having the time of her life, I\u2019m a bit worried for them after that. Next (in the slot of Samba death) it\u2019s ALEX AND NEIL! This week they\u2019re dancing the Samba to \u2018Joyful Joyful\u2019 from Sister Act. I\u2019m both intrigued and a tiny bit worried about how a gospel classic is going to work as a Samba, and after last week\u2019s Argentine Tangle Alex could really do with a showstopper. Fingers crossed, but hopefully not Alex\u2019s feet. Reading tonight\u2019s Terms &amp; Conditions: celebrity choirmaster/Harry Potter impersonator Gareth Malone. Scores: 6,7,8,7 \u2013 a total of 28 for Chris and Karen. Common sense finally prevails. Shirley loved the theatrical bits, but in hold it needed more swing. Bruno loved how the Artful Dodger put on a show, but the Foxtrot felt like intermissions between musical theatre acts, and needed to be more refined. Craig thought it lacked movement around the floor and the Foxtrot was too carefully placed, but the characterisation was fantastic. Motsi thought the open parts were fantastic, but she\u2019s not going to mention the tiny bit Foxtrot she saw. Huge marks all round then? So this looks great in the \u2018cor blimey guvnor\u2019 solo bits, but once Chris is in hold he looks a bit stiff and constipated, all the flow disappears. Not a huge amount of actual Foxtrot either, but hey ho. First up tonight it\u2019s CHRIS AND KAREN! This week they\u2019re dancing the Foxtrot to \u2018Consider Yourself\u2019 from Oliver! Who doesn\u2019t love a bit of Lionel Bart? I feel like Chris is going to embrace the role of Dickensian workhouse ruffian with some enthusiasm. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH! Tess in rainbow tinsel, Claudia in a silver chandelier. They both look spectacular. Haha only kidding, it\u2019s a hot mess all round. We open with a bonus Feem Week pro dance, which has a Hello Dolly thing going on. As someone who briefly went to a school that had straw boaters (don\u2019t ask), I can confirm that they smell terrible. Oh lord, Anton and Kevin are leading the singing. Very much here for Craig singing in spectacular drag, however. Give the 189 a paper bag to breathe into, we\u2019re raising the bar every week. And we\u2019re off! It\u2019s the quarter final, so our five remaining couples are expressing their angst in shadow form, like some kind of neon Tales Of The Unexpected. Bit weird. You\u2019d think it would be quite tough to make a prime time pop music quiz on BBC truly terrible, but this one really nails it. This week\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo \u2013 have a swig of warm interval wine (please place your order at the bar now) for any occurrence of the following: Household furniture Craig getting his ten out Pyrotechnics Tess being patronising Early mentions of TWO DANCES Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing liveblog! We\u2019ve made it Week 11, which means three things: It\u2019s Musicals Week! Prepare yourself for jazz hands, rictus grins, insane props and squashed-in superfluous backing dancers. Hold me closer tiny dancefloor. It\u2019s also the quarter finals! When this season started we were enjoying the sunshine and quietly stockpiling pesto, blissfully unaware that by Week 11 we\u2019d be stuck in a revolving news hell with Pinocchio politicians and pervy princes. Thank goodness for Strictly. The show is less than an hour long! It\u2019s the shortest show of the series, before we move to TWO DANCES next week. After those 2 hour 20 minute liveblog marathons in the early weeks, this is going to be a breeze. Heidi\u2019s Hunches has been pretty poor so far this season, but we\u2019ve come this far so I will doggedly plod on. I have no choice but to put Chris and Karen in the top group, as the judges and public seems to love him \u2013 also Alex and Neil have a Cursed Samba this evening which may well finish them off. Group 1: one eye on the final \u2013 Kelvin and Oti, Chris and Karen, Karim and Amy Group 4: dodging the dance-off \u2013 Emma and Anton, Alex and Neil Curtain up is at 7.10pm, so gather appropriate snacks/drink/blankets/loved ones and settle in! See you in a bit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
