But what about holidays? Can the discerning traveller really get everything they demand at a competitive price by adopting fair-trade principles? The concept of the fair-trade holiday has been pioneered by the charity Tourism Concern (tourismconcern.org.uk). Certain hotel chains and travel operators claim to take their environmental commitment seriously, yet still overlook their social and economic responsibilities. The philosophy behind fair-trade travel is to redress this balance by making sure local people get a fair share of tourism revenue. The objectives are simple: employing local people wherever possible; offering fair wages and treatment; showing cultural respect; involving communities in deciding how tourism is developed; and making sure that visitors have minimal environmental impact. All fair enough when you think about it. What the savvy traveller realises is that when you add all this up, not only are the locals happier to see you, but you get a better holiday. Although, there is not yet an official fair-trade accreditation for holidays, the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO) has worked hard to produce responsible tourism guidelines for its members, and a new but growing breed of companies, operated as much by principles as profits, offers a fantastic range of holidays. Here are some of the best options for responsible and adventurous travellers. Caribbean See St Lucia through different eyes as you travel on the island famed for its natural beauty and eclectic culture. Accommodation ranges from the grand plantation house at Balenbouche to the stunning volcanic-rim location of La Haut in Soufri\u00e8re. Discovery Initiatives' mission is to support wildlife conservation and community enterprises. Tours are people-oriented and use locally-owned accommodation, food and guides as far as possible. A fee is also paid to the Heritage Fund Trust, which maintains the island's natural areas. When to go: November to February. Where to book: Discovery Initiatives (01285 643333, discoveryinitiatives.com). 12 days' B&amp;B from \u00a32,075pp including flights, transfers and all activities. Nepal Trekkers in Nepal couldn't be in better hands than those of Doug Scott, who in 1975 became the first Briton to climb Everest. His company, Community Action Treks (CAT), offers the ultimate trek through the foothills of the Himalayas, with visitors experiencing the area's Buddhist traditions and friendly Sherpa people. After acclimatisation, the trip culminates in the walk to base camp and an awe-inspiring view of the south-west face of Everest. CAT has played a vital role in improving conditions for porters who, with less responsible tours, often walk huge distances, carrying heavy loads without basic equipment such as shoes or fleeces. CAT also contributes to local projects, including health posts, clean water supplies and income generating schemes. When to go: Departures in February, April, September and December. Where to book: Community Action Treks (01228 564488, catreks.com). 20 days from \u00a31,795 including accommodation, most meals, camping equipment and guides, flights and transfers. The Gambia The Gambia is ideal for reasonably-priced winter sun, catering for people who want to make the most of palm-fringed beaches and laid-back African culture. However, local people have suffered from the influx of big tour companies and the growth of all-inclusives. Offering the chance to chill out without being confined to the usual holiday resorts, Tribes Travel, last year's winner of the British Airways Tourism for Tomorrow Awards, employs local people to show visitors around their country, with time to relax on the beach, take river trips, visit palm winemakers and enjoy the lively musical culture. When to go: October to May. Where to book: Tribes Travel (01728 685971, tribes.co.uk). Eight days' full-board from \u00a3480pp, including all excursions and transfers, but not flights. Romania A journey down the Danube Delta, staying on a houseboat is the perfect introduction to a country that, until recently, was only known to tourists as the home of Dracula. Lined with traditional fishing villages and reed cottages, the area is a World Heritage Site, rich in bird life and some more unusual creatures, such as boars and polecats. Little Earth Tours is a family company that aims to provide an authentic experience in which you can sample the country's history and way of life. Local people are actively involved in the development and management of holidays, and 60% of the tour cost is spent locally. When to go: May to September.

Spain Fair-trade travel is not only relevant to developing countries - parts of the Spanish and Balearic environment particularly have suffered from tourist influxes. A perfect way to escape the crowds is with a cycling holiday through the quiet coastal back roads of the Catalan region and, with the emphasis on relaxed exploration, you can pause to spend time in sleepy medieval villages or refresh yourself with a dip in the sea. Hoping to increase customers' understanding of the regions they visit, Inntravel provides information on culture, history and gastronomy. Most holidays take place in rural areas that have suffered from depopulation, and the use of locally-owned hotels and taxi firms brings employment and regeneration to these areas. Walking routes also help to keep traditional drovers' roads and other paths open. When to go: March to June; September to November. Where to book: Inntravel (01653 629000, inntravel.co.uk). Seven days' half-board from \u00a3760, including flights, transfers and bike hire. Egypt The action-packed Overland Adventure offered by Wind, Sand and Stars takes in the pyramids and the Sphinx, off-road driving in the Sinai, trekking with Bedouin people and sleeping under the stars. The trip ends with the chance to snorkel in the Red Sea, one of the world's top diving spots. The company has been collaborating with local guides for 12 years. Work, such as leading camel treks, enables local people to stay in the region rather than seeking work in big cities, and guests receive a local insight to the area. When to go: Spring and autumn. The trip described below departs in May. Where to book: Wind, Sand and Stars (020-7359 7551, windsandstars.co.uk). 10 days from \u00a3690, including accommodation, meals, local guides and 4x4 hire, but not flights. Japan From neon and hi-tech gadgets to ancient temples and shrines, Intrepid's Land of the Rising Sun tour immerses visitors in a culture that is not always easy to penetrate. Travelling by bullet train, car and boat offers the chance to visit attractions such as the Sake brewery and famous onsen (hot springs) or to marvel at the now bustling city of Hiroshima. Using public transport where possible, Intrepid employs local guides and uses small-scale, locally-owned accommodation and restaurants. Group leaders work to assess the impact of their operations, and travellers are invited to contribute to the Intrepid Foundation, which aids development and conservation projects in the areas they visit. When to go: March to May. Where to book: Intrepid Travel (020-8960 6333, intrepidtravel.com). 14 days from \u00a31,120, including accommodation, most excursions, some transport, but not flights, meals or rail passes. Zanzibar Known as the Spice Island, Zanzibar is a heady mix of ancient Arab culture, lush vegetation and dazzling beaches. The capital of Stone Town is the gateway to the coastal resorts and the island's fertile interior where cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon grow in abundance. A trip on a traditional dhow is a great way to explore the coast, and the lucky ones will get a chance to swim with dolphins. Rainbow Tours has good links with locally-owned hotels and can organise tours with local guides. Travellers receive cultural information about their destination before departure. When to go: December to February; July to September. Where to book: Rainbow Tours (020-7226 1004, rainbowtours.co.uk).10 days from \u00a31,650, including accommodation, flights and transfers. Peru There are few experiences that beat arriving in time to see the sun rise over the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu. Although hardly off the beaten track, it is justifiably the main selling point of Explore Worldwide's Inca Trail tour, which takes in the Nazca Lines (mysterious figures cut into the desert), Lake Titicaca and the ancient Inca city of Cusco. The trek itself is not for the unfit (there are hundreds of steps to contend with), but the amazing views should help take your mind off your aching muscles. With the philosophy that \"small groups leave fewer footprints\", all Explore's customers are issued with sustainable tourism guidelines (covering issues from begging to bartering), and the company supports local projects. Explore's example of treating porters fairly is forcing other operators in the area to adopt a more progressive outlook. When to go: February to December. Where to book: Explore Worldwide (01252 760000, exploreworldwide.com). 15 days from \u00a31,399 including accommodation, some meals, selected excursions and flights. Iceland A great choice for those looking for something a little more original is a trip to Iceland. Visitors with Arctic Experience can sample the nightlife in Reykjavik, take to the snow or go white-water rafting. However, whale-watching is the principle draw. The realisation that these mammals are worth more alive than dead has been of huge benefit to local communities who, instead of hunting them, are now employed in operating many of the 600,000 trips a year. Although Arctic Experience focuses mainly on conservation, local revenue is generated by accommodation in guest houses and farms, while local guides are specially selected for their professionalism, good nature and knowledge. When to go: May to September. Where to book: Arctic Experience (01737 214214, arctic-experience.co.uk). Seven days from \u00a3657 including accommodation with breakfast and flights. \u00b7 The Good Alternative Travel Guide by Mark Mann, published by Tourism Concern and Earthscan, priced \u00a39.99, includes a wealth of information for travellers interested in responsible tourism.
