The cavalry may march in tweed but it's still the cavalry. The effort is led by the philosopher Roger Scruton, and yesterday we identified a couple of those he has contacted in an effort to find true Conservatives worthy of deployment. Professor Gwyn Prins of the London School of Economics is with him. He was a signatory to Scruton's letter. Do you really believe the country's institutions have been \"captured\" by the left? we asked him. \"To ask the question in this way \u2013 with a revealing 'really' demonstrates the success of the left's 'long march' Gramscian project which lies principally in deeply embedding smuggled assumptions,\" replied the professor. \"So back to first principles, which is what this discussion group is about.\" And is it right, we asked, that a first step will be a flushing of the hopeless leftism at the Guardian? The prof didn't answer that directly. Why would he? But we're right to be concerned. \"Helpful to reflect on the reasons why the BBC fiasco happened,\" he said. \"In a Kulturkampf, conquest of the terms of debate creates 'group think' and that precedes occupation of institutional seats.\" Someone will have to sell the revolution to the wider public. It probably won't be him. \u2022 Indignation from Labour about the government's failure to get to grips with the rapacious energy firms, and rightly so. But then we have a system designed to ensure the consumer comes off worst, with much of our energy having been effectively nationalised by foreign firms either owned or substantially assisted by their own governments. How did it get to this? There has been lively debate within the London Review of Books after a masterly examination of that phenomenon by James Meek; and from that comes a letter from a former public sector official, John Perry. There was little Labour could have done about the energy sell-off. By the time it came into office that die was cast. But there was much that could have been done in other areas. \"I was at a couple of meetings in 1996 that brought together the rump of the state-owned enterprises that had survived the Thatcher and Major privatisations,\" says Perry. \"They included the bodies running the tube, the canals, Manchester Airport, the Scottish water supply, the Post Office and air traffic control.\" All were publicly owned; all needed to raise money for capital investment. \"They were well aware of the rules in the rest of Europe that enabled (and still enable) a firm like EDF to behave like a private company but to enjoy the advantages of low borrowing costs backed by government. The case was made to the Labour opposition for the same rules to be adopted here.\" Perry briefed John Battle, then a shadow minister, as to the potential benefits for housing. Briefed in the wider sphere was Alistair Darling, then shadow Treasury minister, later the chancellor. \"Nothing came of it.\" The rest is painful history, as they say. \u2022 Chickens come home to roost for Ian Kerr \u2013 the man who ran the construction industry trade union blacklist for 16 years. He addresses the Scottish affairs select committee. He is not happy. McAlpine's paid my \u00a35,000 court fine for breaching data protection laws, says Kerr, but they didn't give me severance pay. \"If you had better trade union representation you might have got a better deal,\" quips chair Ian Davidson. Even Kerr is forced to smile. \u2022 In this, the week of Leveson, we have been asking, how old are the dark arts of journalism? Older than Caxton, one suspects. Stanley Firmin, the Daily Telegraph crime correspondent in the 1940s, recalled in his memoirs a fellow crime reporter covering a murder near the Blackwall Tunnel. With no police breakthrough, the reporter cut his finger, soaked his hanky in the blood and left it in the tunnel for the police to find. He then wrote a story headlined The Clue of The Bloodstained Handkerchief. It's Leveson versus nature and nurture. Good luck, M'Lud. \u2022 Finally, there is Your Britain, Ed Miliband's online repository of new policy ideas, where one can assess the work of the Education and Children Policy Commission.
