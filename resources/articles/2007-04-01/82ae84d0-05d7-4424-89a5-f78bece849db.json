He still makes the average greyhound look pedestrian - his Leicester team-mate Geordan Murphy says he has never played with anyone quicker - and his strike rate remains staggering. How many tries would most wings consider impressive after 50 first-team starts and 11 further brief appearances as a replacement? Twenty-five? Thirty? Varndell has so far registered 44, including two in last weekend's EDF Energy Cup final against the Ospreys. Yet on the eve of today's Heineken Cup semi-final against Llanelli Scarlets the statistics do not tell even a fraction of the real story. Gone is the cocksure youth who thought he had the game cracked last May as he packed his England touring bags for Australia. In his place, leaning on a rubbish skip and making a rueful joke about recycling his own career, is a young sportsman who has glimpsed the rough side of his unpredictable trade. Even Varndell himself makes no effort to play down the mental turmoil he experienced after being exposed by the Wallaby wing Lote Tuqiri last summer. To add insult to insult he was loaned out to Bedford last autumn, the equivalent of Wayne Rooney being packed off to Plymouth Argyle for a month to regain some confidence. Shortly afterwards, at the age of 21, his girlfriend Claire fell unexpectedly pregnant. Life, suddenly, was less simple for the boy with the winged feet. For several weeks he felt vulnerable and depressed. \"When I got loaned out to Bedford it was one of the lowest points I've ever had. At the time I was still training with England and turned up having played for Bedford at the weekend. I remember thinking: 'I don't want to be here at the moment.'\" Leicester's head coach, Pat Howard, though, told him he had no chance of making the Leicester first XV and there were no A team games scheduled. \"He gave me an ultimatum: I could either sit on my arse in the gym or play some rugby, get my confidence back and prove myself again. I turned up at Bedford thinking: 'Oh my God' but everyone was really good to me. I managed to score a long-range try in my first game against Exeter in front of a big crowd and it was one of my happiest moments of the season. It was liberating to be away from the pressures of the Premiership, as well as humbling. To go from the summer tour to playing Division One rugby was a bit of a shock.\" A further setback followed when he twisted a knee in his second game away at Waterloo. The following month, having limped back to Leicester, he discovered he was to be a father in August. \"It was a bit of a burden on my shoulders and there were other external pressures. For a 21-year-old I've had a lot to deal with in a short space of time. I'm better for it now. I feel a lot more sure in myself.\" What should be obvious by now is that Varndell requires sensitive handling if he is to thrive for club or country. In that respect he has been fortunate to have Howard at Leicester. The Tigers' soon-to-depart coach has spent countless hours tutoring and reassuring his young strike runner who, by his own admission, was in a fragile state when he returned from Australia last June. The 6ft 3in wing also consulted two sports psychologists. \"I came back thinking I was the worst player in the world. Everything seemed to be going horribly wrong. Everyone was saying that I was the next big thing about to set the world alight. I thought it would be a walk in the park. But we didn't put out the strongest teams against a Wallaby side who saw us coming and weren't going to roll over. You come up against better players in international rugby and I got found out. It took me a long time to recover from that. It's only now that I feel I'm getting back to something near my best.\" The implication is that he felt the then England management hung him out to dry against Tuqiri and Co before he had developed the tools to cope. \"I don't want to slag off any of the coaches on that tour. But what annoyed me was that I'd been built up to be something I wasn't. The truth was that I'd done well in the Premiership because of the players around me. It was unrealistic to expect a scratch side to go down to Australia and develop an instant understanding and a couple of us really suffered. I got absolutely ruined by Tuqiri. I got taught lessons which have benefited me since but it was pretty bad.\" Even in his darkest hour, though, there was a degree of solace. When he momentarily left his nemesis Tuqiri floundering in an otherwise grim first Test in Sydney it offered a glimpse of the prolific teenage talent schooled at Colston's in Bristol where he appeared alongside, among others, Shane Geraghty. Shaun Edwards, for one, remains a fan and reckons Varndell could be another Martin Offiah. The same gliding pace, deceptive power and hunger for tries are all evident, even if Dan Hipkiss was the generous creator of his team-mate's match-clinching tries against Stade Fran\u00e7ais and the Ospreys. The Stade try also taught him not to celebrate too prematurely: \"I suddenly realised there were six minutes to go and thought: 'Oh no, if they get a drop-goal I'm going to look a real dick.'\" Amid the flashes of self-absorption, though, lurks a personable, maturing individual who, according to Howard, \"has worked really hard\" on his weaknesses and deserves another chance at the big time. \"As I've said to the England A coach, Jim Mallinder,\" says Howard, \" you can't coach that sort of speed,\". Some people are born to run, even in the Walkers Stadium."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
