Will anyone get out alive? For the first 10 minutes, I wasn\u2019t sure. The parody felt broad, the jokes broader still. \u201cLord von Fistenberg treated me to a big shiny pearl necklace!\u201d: it\u2019s like Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys with more face paint. But there\u2019s no resisting the exuberance of Death Drop. Soon, as its cast of pop starlets, tweedy squires and tabloid hacks assemble, and the phone lines are cut, and the roads blocked, this \u201cDragatha Christie\u201d mystery exerts a grip \u2013 of the comedic, if not the suspense, variety. If the cross-dressing has no influence on the unfolding plot, its impact is felt in the cartoonish character of the undertaking. Supposedly, we\u2019re in a stately home on Tuck Island, where a motley collection of guests arrive to celebrate Charles and Di\u2019s 10th wedding anniversary. In fact, we\u2019re in panto-land, where, even in the face of a fatal threat, there\u2019s time for a whole scene written in tongue-twisters or an impromptu performance of I\u2019m Too Sexy by Right Said Fred. Among the caricatures on display, Drag Race star Courtney Act is a Kylie-alike diva, forever feigning reluctance to sing, Kemah Bob a priapic film-maker, and LoUis CYfer fantastic as a blithering shire Tory in the Johnson mould. (\u201cI couldn\u2019t kill anyone, not with these soft Conservative hands!\u201d) The action is just as lurid: one set piece finds northern housemaid Brie (writer Holly Stars: a scene-stealer) swinging a pooey loo-brush around for outr\u00e9 effect. And this is a murder mystery in which the dead have a habit of rising again, or delivering long perorations \u2013 or indeed songs \u2013 before they finally expire. It\u2019s baggy, it overruns, and it doesn\u2019t know how to end. There\u2019s no jeopardy \u2013 but if we don\u2019t care whether someone lives or dies, we enjoy the baroque ways (shades of Improbable\u2019s Theatre of Blood here) in which Stars\u2019 script dispatches them. Scalped by a ninja, anyone? Poisoned by a crispy pancake? Dame Agatha might have bridled \u2013 but for West End audiences, it\u2019s rollicking good fun. \u2022 At Garrick theatre, London, until 17 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
