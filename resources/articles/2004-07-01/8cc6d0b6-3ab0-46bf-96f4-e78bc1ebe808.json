This time it was a visit to the dentist, which normally wouldn't be a problem, except this was a dentist on the outside and I was trying to decide whether I should reveal to the receptionist that I was still a serving prisoner. I pass the smart chrome-and-glass frontage of the surgery every morning on my walk from the City station to the office, and if it hadn't been for the notice on the door last week I'd never have considered that it might be a place suitable for the likes of me. \"Last few NHS places available,\" the notice announced. \"Sign up now.\" I wasn't in great need of a dentist, but you never know when an emergency might occur - and I had seen on television news reports the queues due to the shortage of NHS dentists. It was an opportunity too good to miss. In the waiting room the receptionist handed me a form to fill in. How stupid I'd been. Of course I couldn't just give my name. They wanted an address, personal details, the name of my doctor. I hesitated before writing in the boxes. The receptionist had called me \"mister\". Her manner towards me had been impeccably courteous and I didn't want that to change. Knowing my status might not have affected her attitude, but how could I be sure? It's not exactly the same, I know, but I remember when the Kid revealed to some strangers on a train a couple of years ago that he was a prisoner working in the community. He had done his 10 years and was on the verge of release. He had worked hard and not wasted any of his prison time - a remarkable feat, considering he was sentenced to life at the age of 16. It must have been a daunting prospect in the beginning; it must have seemed undoable. But he did it. And with the outside world beckoning, I understood his need to be accepted for who he was, to be acknowledged as a fellow human being again by ordinary people. I wasn't sure that a crowded train compartment was the right place to test the water, mind you. He'd got talking; the big question was inevitable: \"And what do you do?\" When it came the Kid told the truth. \"It just didn't feel right to lie,\" he told me afterwards. He got a considerate reaction, but he was lucky - it could easily have ended in tears. With my car in for repairs a few weeks ago, after it had been broken into, I managed to get a lift to the station the next morning in a fellow prisoner's car. But I had to get a cab for the return trip as I hadn't had time to book a place on the prison van. The driver was female and she smiled when I asked her if she was free. I plonked my briefcase in the back and as I climbed in after it I told her the address of my destination. \"The prison?\" she said. \"Er, yes please,\" I said. It felt nice to be chauffeured. I had no intention of letting on to the driver that it was my first unfettered mini-cab ride in 20 years, nor was I going to mention that those 20 years had been spent in prison. But I hadn't especially intended to keep my prisoner status from her. After all, she knew where I was going. Then, less than a minute into the journey, she asked: \"Worked there long?\" Before I could chuckle and correct her mistake she added, \"If you ask me, I think that lot get too much.\" My good mood waned. We had another 15 minutes together. I wanted to engage with her, to find out why she had the mean attitude. But there wasn't time. So I let her believe I was a member of staff and I asked her to drop me by the works department offices and gave her a \u00a32 tip. I hated myself for not disclosing the truth - but decided, on balance, it was necessary in the circumstances. The receptionist at the dentist's, on the other hand, had not mistaken me for anything other than a potential patient. I liked that. It's what I was. I didn't want her to think of me as anything else. So I wrote my soon-to-be home address on the form. Where it asked for doctor's details, I wrote that I hadn't lived there long and hadn't yet registered. The receptionist read through my details and didn't bat an eyelid. \"We have a complimentary clean for new patients. Can I book you an appointment?\" She called me \"mister\" again. \"Yes,\" I said. \"Thank you. Thank you so much.\" I was conscious of sounding overly grateful. She could never have guessed why. \u00b7 To order a copy of A Life Inside: A Prisoner's Notebook for \u00a37.99 with free UK p&amp;P, call 0870 836 0749."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
