Three world champions, Lewis Hamilton, Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso, had criticised the plan. Hamilton said: \"I think it's a shame what's happening to formula one. It's hard to believe these recent decisions will improve things for the trackside spectators and TV viewers, who should always be our No1 priority, but I guess we'll have to wait and see. Whatever the points system, I know all formula one drivers will always race our hearts out.\" A statement by the FIA said: \"On 17 March the FIA World Motor Sport Council unanimously rejected FOTA's proposed amendment to the points system for the Formula One Drivers' Championship. The 'winner-takes-all' proposal made by the commercial rights holder [Bernie Ecclestone] was then approved. If, for any reason, the formula one teams do not now agree with the new system, its implementation will be deferred until 2010.\" FOTA had earlier made it clear it felt the new system had no validity. According to the FIA, the WMSC acted on the word of Ecclestone, who apparently claimed all the teams were in support. It was on that basis the new plan was adopted. Ecclestone had previously suggested that the first three finishers in a grand prix should be awarded gold, silver and bronze medals and that the champion would be the driver who won the most golds. He justified this by suggesting that too many drivers played a tactical game and that it was unfair that a driver who had not won most of the races could win the title by driving gently and amassing the biggest points tally. The teams' proposal was to amend the top of the current points system, which awards 10 for a win, eight for second and six for third, with a 12-9-7 system for the first three finishers to place a greater premium on the podium places. That was unanimously rejected by the WMSC, which opted for a variant of Ecclestone's idea, albeit with no medals. FOTA quickly convened and \"unanimously agreed to question the validity\" of the WMSC's decision. A statement read: \"FOTA had made a proposal that was based on the results of a global audience survey, which allowed listening to preferences of the public, and all the teams firmly believe these indications should be properly taken into account. The amendment to the sporting regulations proposed by the WMSC was not performed in accordance with the procedure provided for by Appendix 5 of the Sporting Regulations and, as per the provisions of article 199 of the FIA International Sporting Code, it is too late for the FIA to impose a change for the 2009 season that has not obtained the unanimous agreement of all the competitors properly entered into the 2009 Formula One Championship. \"Since the change to the scoring system unanimously agreed by the teams and proposed to the FIA did not receive approval of the WMSC, no change can occur in 2009.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
