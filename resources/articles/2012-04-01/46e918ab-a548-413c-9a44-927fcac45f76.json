One-time Christ Caviezel is our family man wrangling evil robbers, headed up by squinty James Frain. They're better than this; flip the leads and suddenly you've got a miles more interesting thriller. As it is, Transit delivers little of value, and never with a smile."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
