Experts say the district\u2019s \u201cData Deletion Week\u201d may be the first of its kind in the country. It\u2019s not exactly an accident that schools in Montgomery county, in the suburbs of Washington DC, are leading the way on privacy protections for kids. The large school district is near the headquarters of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency. It\u2019s a place where many federal employees, lawyers and security experts send their own kids. As digital surveillance of American students expands rapidly in schools across the country, sparking new debates over tradeoffs between privacy and safety, Montgomery county is a revealing example of what protections some of the nation\u2019s most well-informed, privacy-savvy parents think their children need. Like thousands of American public school districts, Montgomery county gives students laptops and has hired tech companies to track students\u2019 activities on those computers, including monitoring what they search for and what websites they visit. This digital surveillance \u2013 a booming industry \u2013 is marketed as a way to keep kids safe from school shootings and self-harm. It also generates detailed data on individual children. Montgomery county parents fear that data might someday be used against their kids. This is not a distant worry. Teenagers are already facing consequences for private behavior online. In 2017, Harvard rescinded the admissions of at least 10 incoming students for sharing racist and obscene jokes in a private Facebook group chat. This year, Harvard rescinded an offer of admission to Kyle Kashuv, a conservative activist from Parkland, Florida, because of racist comments he had made in text messages and a shared Google Doc as a 16-year-old, a decision that sparked a heated national debate. Parents across the US told the Guardian that they were afraid about having detailed educational data about their children \u2013 like how quickly they complete their homework \u2013 being fed into the enormous black box of the data mining industry. Companies have long gathered, traded and sold vast quantities of data on individuals\u2019 online behavior and consumer purchases, information that is also combined with public voter data and used to create targeted political advertising. Individuals have little way to know how their data is shared from one company to another, and no power to prevent giant, frequent data breaches. By requiring tech companies to delete data they collect on schoolchildren once a year, parent activists in Montgomery county said they hope to shield kids from being held accountable in adulthood for youthful mistakes, as well as to guard them from exploitation by what one parent termed \u201cthe student data surveillance industrial complex\u201d. Montgomery county public schools tested Data Deletion Week last year and publicly launched the program this past August. While not all student data is deleted that week, the district works to clean much of students\u2019 digital slates over the summer, including data collected by Google and by GoGuardian, which tracks students\u2019 web searches, according to Peter Cevenini, the district\u2019s chief technology officer. The district demands more than a vague assurance from tech companies that the data has been erased: \u201cThey send us a certification that officially confirms legally that the information has been deleted from their servers,\u201d Cevenini said. GoGuardian has already submitted its formal certification; the district is still waiting for formal certification from Google, Cevenini said. One of the parent leaders of the Data Deletion Week campaign was Bradley Shear, an attorney who specializes in social media and privacy policy. Shear said he was attending a conference for privacy law scholars in Washington a few years ago when he received a phone call from his son\u2019s teacher informing him that the second-grader was in trouble for having Googled the song Fuck You, by CeeLo Green, on his school laptop. Shear said he was certain that his son had not searched for the song on purpose, and that the auto-complete function in Google search was to blame. But the incident prompted him to try to make sure that GoGuardian, which the school pays to monitor students\u2019 search and website visits, would delete the data it had collected on his son. The response he eventually got from the tech company in 2017, a pledge to delete or \u201cde-identify\u201d his child\u2019s data, was not enough for Shear. As a policy expert who had worked to pass social media privacy laws in states across the country, Shear said, he knew that \u201cde-identified\u201d data could usually be re-identified again. He decided to push for district-wide changes in how GoGuardian and other companies retain children\u2019s data, including working to educate and organize other parents to push the school district to change its policies and require tech companies to regularly delete student data. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to keep for ever what these kids are searching for online, or what\u2019s in their Gchats,\u201d Shear said. \u201cEven when data is supposed to only be used for one purpose, it will be used for other purposes,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any of this stuff hanging out and then being used against kids when they apply to college.\u201d Shear met with district officials to discuss his concerns, and he soon found allies on the district\u2019s active parent-teacher association, which has an entire committee dedicated to \u201csafe technology\u201d issues. One parent on the safe tech committee, who asked that her name not be used to protect her son\u2019s privacy, had an experience similar to Shear\u2019s. She said her then eight-year-old son typed in \u201csave the land\u201d when doing a book report on conservation, \u201cand up came the Ku Klux Klan \u2026 \u2018Save the land, join the Klan.\u2019 He didn\u2019t know what that was,\u201d she said. When she talked to the teacher and suggested wiping the search from her son\u2019s browser history, the teacher said that would not be possible, the parent recalled. If anyone was building a digital footprint of her son\u2019s behavior, the parent said, there would now be a visit to a Klan site in it. \u201cKids are curious. They\u2019re just going to plug in some key words thinking that they\u2019re funny, and it just might stick,\u201d she said. \u201cI want my child to do whatever he wants to do with his career and his life,\u201d said Ellen Zavian, a George Washington University law professor and another of the parent advocates. \u201cIf he wants to run for office, something he did in second grade shouldn\u2019t hold him back. If he wants to apply for college, he should have no data that the colleges have bought that would provide a negative data point. \u201cMy goal is to have my son have the smallest [data] footprint to give him the largest opportunity,\u201d she said. Not a simple process Even with broad parental support, demanding that companies delete student data was not a simple process, Shear said. Parents had to work with the school district to understand what the district had agreed to in its contracts with different technology companies, and to figure out if the contract language needed to be changed. The parents also wanted tech companies not simply to say they had deleted student data, but to certify that they had done so in an official letter to the district. \u201cIt was a complicated process,\u201d Shear said. \u201cIt was not something that was so simple.\u201d While parent fears over student data and privacy are \u201cnewer concerns\u201d for school districts, the pushback that the district heard from a few parent activists also amounted to \u201ckind of universal concerns\u201d, and school officials decided to \u201cget ahead of the game and see how we can address them\u201d, Cevenini, the district\u2019s chief technology officer, said. Amelia Vance, the director of education privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum, said that, as far as she is aware, Montgomery county is the only American school district to have implemented an annual Data Deletion Week, although parent activists across the country have pushed for other student privacy laws at the state level. Deleting records of students\u2019 online behavior on a regular basis is a \u201cfabulous\u201d choice, Vance said, but doing it just once a year might not be frequent enough. Video surveillance footage is often deleted once a month, just long enough to be clear if there\u2019s an incident that needs to be reviewed, she said, and a similar 30-day time period might also be appropriate for students\u2019 online behavior. While there are good reasons for schools to monitor students\u2019 internet usage \u2013 like making sure that \u201cstudents aren\u2019t being radicalized on YouTube\u201d or \u201cviewing totally inappropriate content\u201d, Vance said, that monitoring can also be \u201cincredibly invasive\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a reflection of every aspect of kids\u2019 lives today,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is every question they ask in their brain and type into Google to see if there\u2019s an answer. It\u2019s every chat message that they type to their friends, every essay they write for English class.\u201d But school districts also may face some barriers in developing Data Deletion Week policies, she said, including different state data retention laws, and parents\u2019 and students\u2019 desire to be able to save some of their school projects from frequent data purges. Shear, the attorney who led the push for Data Deletion Week, said he sees the rapid growth of the school surveillance industry as a \u201chuge issue\u201d and one that needed much more attention from students and their families. \u201cMost parents don\u2019t understand these issues until something happens,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really care about something until you\u2019re discriminated against, or until you lose out to another person based on something you might never even have thought of.\u201d The Montgomery county parent activists acknowledged that their push to change their district\u2019s policies benefited from the expertise of the Washington-area parents involved, which included not only attorneys but people with expertise in security, privacy and politics. Having that kind of expertise behind a parent privacy campaign \u201cis unusual\u201d, Zavian said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean that other communities can\u2019t pull on those resources. They have them. They just have to find them. It may take a little longer.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
