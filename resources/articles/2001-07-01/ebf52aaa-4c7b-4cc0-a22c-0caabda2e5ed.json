Judging by this performance, the dreadlocked ex-Fugee wants to be everything to everybody. He admitted as much in a rap about how he hates the way music gets pigeonholed by race or genre, whether it's R&amp;B, rock'n'roll or Cuban. To prove his point, he grabbed his Fender and led his band into a primitive 1950s stomper, playing the guitar upside down and behind his back. Later on, Wyclef declared it to be smooch time and launched into a treacly version of Guantanamera. Much later still, there was Wyclef and co lurching through Dylan's Knocking On Heaven's Door, like a Holiday Inn reggae band drowning in an endless supply of rum punch. But that was by no means all. Wyclef also seems to have the Zelig-like ability to take on the characteristics of his surroundings. Thus, he had apparently convinced himself that he was the true spiritual leader of Brixton's Jamaican community, spouting improvised visionary poetry and lapsing into an embarrassing pastiche of Bob Marley patois. Inevitably, he felt compelled to give us an interminable version of Marley's Redemption Song, in which the technical failure of his guitar merely inspired him to go on and on, while the crowd waved lighters in the air as if this were Woodstock or Wembley Stadium. Still, to give Wyclef his due, he's not afraid to try anything, however preposterous. He tried some high-speed toasting with the feisty Lady Dynamite, though when he oafishly asked her if she had a boyfriend, she declared firmly that she didn't \"want no Rastaman\". Earlier, Wyclef had vanished from the stage, only to reappear perched unsteadily on the mixing desk in the middle of the floor. Here, he regaled the house with his thoughts on world peace, improvising many memorable couplets such as, \"We've got a United States of America, why can't we have a United States of Africa?\" and, better still, \"I'm a ghetto superstar, after the show I'll have a drink at the bar.\" As for his breakdancing display, we may never see its like again, I hope. But despite a few strong songs, notably 911 and It Doesn't Matter, Wyclef's jack-of-all-trades approach made the show shambolic. Sharper focus required (or a Fugees reunion).
