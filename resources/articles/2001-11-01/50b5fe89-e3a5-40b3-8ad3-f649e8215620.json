I like to refer to it as a steadily improving shambles. I have travelled myself and therefore know what it is like to be wholly reliant on websites for information on the Shrimpers. The site therefore is intended to be a service for all the Southend exiles (whether they be in Suffolk or Spain, Bognor or Brampton) as well as being a showcase to hopefully enhance my career in website production/online journalism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
