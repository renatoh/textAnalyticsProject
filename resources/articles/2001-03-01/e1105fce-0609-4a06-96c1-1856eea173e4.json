The 32-year-old striker, capped eight times by Italy, reached two cup finals and scored 33 goals in 51 games for Boro after signing in 1996 from Juventus, but he left under a cloud in September 1997 after their relegation to the First Division. Now a fringe player at Lazio, he has expressed a willingness to return to English football. \"We have spoken about him,\" said Boro's first-team coach Terry Venables yesterday, \"but whether the club are prepared to consider him I'm not sure.\" Boro hope to have concluded the transfer of Dean Windass from Bradford in time for the forward to make his debut against Newcastle tomorrow. An initial fee of \u00a3600,000 was agreed with an extra \u00a3400,000 dependent on Boro avoiding relegation. But, with the two clubs due to meet in the league on May 5, the Football Association refused to sanction the deal. Boro are now expected to pay the whole fee up front. Jim Jefferies's continuing efforts to \"save money\" at Bradford have prompted the surprise return of David Hopkin to Crystal Palace for \u00a31.5m. Hopkin is the seventh player to leave Valley Parade over the past few weeks as Jefferies continues to cut a swath through his squad in preparation for First Division life. The Everton midfielder Scot Gemmill has been recalled to Scotland's squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Belgium and San Marino this month, but Liverpool's Gary McAllister missed out despite offering to end his self-imposed international retirement. Scotland squad: Douglas (Celtic), Gould (Celtic), Main (St Johnstone), Sullivan (Tottenham), Boyd (Celtic), Elliott (Leicester), Hendry (Bolton), Pressley (Hearts), Weir (Everton), Burley (Derby), Cameron (Hearts), Ferguson (Rangers), Gemmill (Everton), Holt (Kilmarnock), Lambert (Celtic), Matteo (Leeds), Dickov (Man City), Dodds (Rangers), Gallacher (Newcastle) Hutchison (Sunderland), Johnston (Rangers)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
