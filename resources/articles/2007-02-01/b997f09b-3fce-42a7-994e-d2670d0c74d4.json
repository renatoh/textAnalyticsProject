Just look at this week's Spectator. In response to all the Dave-related fuss, there's a piece about the thrills of young upper-class manhood by James Delingpole, a writer who has skilfully turned his upmarket origins into the perfect subject matter for wind-up column writing (witness his recent claim to be \"a member of probably the most discriminated-against subsection in the whole of British society: the white, middle-aged, public-school-and-Oxbridge educated middle-class male\" - arf, arf), though his latest provocative masterpiece rather pales next to the weekly politics article by Fraser Nelson. \"The disclosure that David Cameron was punished for smoking marijuana at Eton has had little political impact,\" he says. \"The more significant event was the widespread republication of a picture of Mr Cameron with members of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford.\" Nelson goes on to look at whether the Labour party might zero in on this, claiming that the \"Buller\" photo is \"the very image of the Brideshead-style privilege and decadence which [Gordon] Brown has despised all his adult life: public school, Oxford, England.\" Leaving aside whether the chancellor feels quite as hostile to old Albion as all that, there is apparently little chance of an attack: perhaps thanks to Tony Blair's education at Fettes, Brown, \"has been warned by the Blairites that inverted snobbery will no longer wash with the British public\". And here lies a very interesting point. For those of us who look at the Bullingdon photo and see something deeply political - which might, with the application of enough wit, become very useful to the Labour party - charges of \"inverted snobbery\" are only to be expected. A slew of CiF posts in response to pieces this week by both myself and Peter Wilby make the point: \"Didn't this type of class envy go out some time in the 1970s?\"; \"I've met very rich people before and they're not that radically different from us and reverse snobbery articles like this do nothing to bridge the gap\"; \"Feel free to judge [Cameron] on his policies when they come as much as you like ... but stooping to this sort of level? You make a mockery of your profession.\" But this is, of course, not about inverted snobbery at all. It's partly about the gap that lies between all that Cameroonian posturing about \"reflecting Britain as it is\" - let alone the Tories' rediscovery of social exclusion, inequality and all the the rest - and the cold reality of high Tory places where the kind of ticket you needed to join the \"Buller\" seems equally important. There are, as my piece pointed out, four Old Etonians (including Cameron) in the shadow cabinet, and 15 on the Tory front bench, while four of Cameron's most senior advisers are also OEs. Equally importantly, it's bound up with the delusions that infect all areas of our politics, and which the Cameroons' backgrounds make glaring. Sorry to make the point yet again, but still - despite two decades of being told that the importance of class has declined, class politics are all over, and that Britain has so embraced the ways of meritocracy that we might at last be able to talk about a \"British dream\" (cheers, Michael Howard), at the bottom and top, class divides are actually hardening up. Social mobility has markedly declined since the 1970s, and seems to be slowing yet further. The government publicly frets about the decline of working-class participation in higher education. Those left behind by the social shifts of the 80s - chiefly, in terms of property ownership - are congealing into what the Victorians knew as the Undeserving Poor, to be either piously wailed over or demonised. Meanwhile, on the other side of the socal spectrum, worries about the sealed-off position of the super-rich shake even the Sunday Telegraph, and mass disconnection from politics is surely fuelled by the impression that parliament is in danger of becoming the roped-off stamping ground of a stereotype that runs across all three major parties: young, ambitious, affectedly centrist, apparently more taken with the political game than high principle - and more often than not, privately educated. Cameron and co are all this in excelsis. And what do you suppose large swathes of the UK hear when they pipe up about the new gospel of \"social responsibility\", whereby the state gets rolled back even further? The cosseted opinions of those who've never needed its help, I would wager. And think about where politics and society are going. The issue of climate change is beginning to change the terms of debate in the UK, orientating politics around a problem that will soon require collective sacrifice, joint resolution, and the idea that all of us - from the globe-travelling city whizz to the hard-working family being told to watch their food miles - will have to act with a pretty unprecedented common purpose. Talk to plenty of environmentalists, and they see this in terms of a kind of benign war effort: not the mass mobilization of yore, but something distinctly analogous to it. Before I wrote this, I had a quick look at George Orwell's The Lion and the Unicorn, the wartime essay straplined \"Socialism and the English genius\", in which he sketched out \"the most class-ridden country under the sun\". Much of what he wrote was based around how hierarchy and privilege will always corrode the kind of collective purpose on which politics, at times of crisis, always has to draw. \"The lady in the Rolls-Royce car is more damaging to morale than a fleet of Goering's bombing planes,\" he said. So what about the bloke in the Bullingdon photograph? And in the midst of all the challenges and crises of the early 21st century, what hope for a Cameroonian government that would be disproportionately staffed by the sons and daughters of the very, very rich?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
