What do a chef and a pizza boy have in common?", "bodyText": "Pizza Boy - Dwayne Monford, 19 Dwayne earns \u00a36.50 an hour cooking pizzas in a Pizza Hut in south London, and doing home deliveries. He cooks three nights a week for a group of Jehovah's Witnesses. He's studying for an NVQ in catering at a local college. 'I regret dropping out. I feel like I let everyone down, Jamie, me, the others on the course. I wish I could rewind and start again. I'm vexed. I could have been one of the top kids there. I could have got myself sent to one of those top restaurants, like Johnny. I'd like to be working in a Michelin-starred restaurant but I'm squeezing cheese onto pizza base. When I am in the kitchen doing pizzas I think about what I might have been doing if I had stayed at Jamie's. I'm doing something really easy here. It's basic. If I was with Jamie, I would be doing something complicated. His style of food is way different and it's really good - good ingredients, small portions, funky shapes. And the customers here don't really understand food. There's this one woman, she comes in and she has all the toppings all on one pizza. That's nasty. That's not the kind of food I want to cook. I want to cook posh people's food for posh people. I know Fifteen was about giving people like me who were expelled from school a second chance but I want another chance. I wasn't ready for it. I didn't see what a great opportunity I was being given. I always played the idiot at school and that was what I did at Fifteen. I thought I was being funny, swapping plates around when I didn't get something right but I was really being an idiot. I don't blame Jamie. I blame myself. I wish someone had told me to knuckle down sooner. But no one said anything. And by the time they did, it was too late. If I got another chance, I wouldn't be as bad. I'd love to go back and work for Jamie. If I saw him, I'd definitely ask him for a job. He might say he would employ me if I knuckled down and got enthusiastic. Maybe. If I didn't work for Jamie, I'd like to work for Gordon Ramsay. I love him, his jokes. When he gets down to work he's tough on people and I think that would be good for me. Jamie's a sweet guy but he's not that tough - he doesn't shout like Gordon. I need that. I like my catering course at Bexleyheath College and a friend is opening a new restaurant in Plumstead which he says will be a bit different. I might go there. But wherever I go I will regret not making it at Fifteen. I still remember the day I left. I just stayed in my room and didn't speak to no-one. I didn't eat. It lasted for a week. My mum dragged me out of that. She said \"you can still do your catering course and another opportunity will come\". I'm still waiting for that chance. I could be doing a lot more for myself than working in Pizza Hut. I could have gone far. I could have done well. Jamie's Kitchen was one of the biggest things I've done in my life and I blew it.' Chef - Johnny Broadfoot, 20 Johnny earns \u00a3900 a month cooking at Lindsay House, a Michelin-starred restaurant in Soho, London. He starts at 8am every day and finishes after 12pm. 'I never expected to graduate and be working in a Michelin-starred restaurant in central London. I feel so lucky. I've been given the chance to get into the industry two rungs up the ladder. Most young chefs find themselves standing in a hallway peeling mushrooms for two years but, here at Lindsay House, I'm really cooking. When Jamie told me I had graduated and I said I wanted to go to Lindsay House he gave me a look that said: \"This is going to go one of two ways - either a great success or a total failure.\" I almost did fail. When I started here they threw me into the garnish section for all the meat and fish. That's the hardest section, even for a qualified chef. I think it was a test, to see if I was really serious about becoming a chef. Richard Corrigan probably reckoned I would quit on the spot. I wanted to show him I could cope. Now, I come in first thing and get the pastry on. Working with the sous chef, I knock out the bread. Then we get on with the mise en place , get the cooking out of the way and get ready for the service. I'm learning so much. It helps that it's such a small kitchen because it means I get lots of one-on-one time. At Fifteen, I was always the one with the punctuality problem, the one with the attitude problem. Jamie helped to knock that out of me.He kept telling me: \"You can cook. But you're only cooking when you want to. When you don't feel like it you are a pain and a prat.\" He was right. He's a fair judge of character. I was only a kid but, thankfully, I was just old enough to realise that, by being so hard on me, Jamie was throwing me an opportunity. I thought: \"Slap yourself about, Johnny, and grab this opportunity.\" I managed it but not everyone did. People like Dwayne didn't. It was not because they couldn't do it. It was because they were too young. Now that I realise what Jamie did for me, I look up to him as a role model. We speak on the phone every week. In the kitchen at Lindsay House Richard says I'm a pain in the neck but I feel like he and the team are on my side, that they don't want me to fail. Jamie taught me that you have to want something really badly to make it work. Sure, it's hard. I come in some days and I fall asleep on the pastry. At the end of the week I'm so tired I don't know my own name. I will work here for a year, then I will have made \u00a315,000. If I leave, it will be to go to another restaurant but my dream is to set up on my own. I've been thinking of doing it with some of the others who were at Fifteen - Ralph, Elisa, Warren, Ben, Tim. It's something we've talked about. But now I'm just relieved to have graduated, to be here - and not to be looking for work any more. Lindsay House is my life.' The winners Ben Arthur, 19 Graduated with distinction Went to work in Tuscany but is now back at Fifteen. He also still works part-time as a DJ in London. 'Jamie has changed everything for me.My work is cooking and the only other thing I have time for is DJ-ing. When you mix two tunes or put some food together you get the same satisfaction,' he says. Ben had never taken any exams before he joined Jamie's Kitchen and had done a series of jobs working on building sites and as a decorator. Elisa Roche, 25 Graduated with merit After working at Fifteen, she is now cooking at Fino, a Spanish restaurant, in Charlotte Street, London. She also wants a career writing about food. 'It was tough at Fifteen but Jamie got me fired up about women making it in the kitchen. I'd like to prove to the Gordon Ramsays of the world that I can be feminine but also be tough.' Elisa went to Edinburgh University to study French and art history but dropped out and eventually ended up living in a hostel for 18 months before joining Jamie's Kitchen . Warren Fleet, 25 Graduated with distinction After a spell at the restaurant MG Garage in Sydney, Australia, Warren is back in London and doing an apprenticeship at Nobu. 'Nobu is the best-known restaurant in the world. Without Fifteen, I would probably never have even heard of it, let alone got a job here.' Before joining Jamie's Kitchen Warren took GCSEs and worked at a money brokers, in Selfridges and for a pawnbroker. Tim Siadaton, 19 Graduated with distinction Went on to work for Salt, a fusion cuisine restaurant in Sydney, Australia, and is now cooking at Morrish on Bondi Beach. When he dropped out of school and went travelling in South East Asia he vowed to get a job abroad. He says: 'Jamie taught me to be passionate, to love the adrenaline rush of working in a restaurant. It makes up for the boring bits, like peeling 500 spuds.' Kevin Boyle, 19 (replaced Roberto di Mambro) Graduated Kevin went on to consider a future in religion. 'I wanted to do some missionary work and become a minister.' He is now back to cooking at Smiths of Smithfield in Clerkenwell. 'Jamie said I needed more experience, so I graduated a few months later than the others. That helped me get my head together and back into cooking.' Once a supermarket shelf-stacker, he had already started a college cookery course before joining Jamie's Kitchen. Ralph Johnson, 21 Graduated with distinction He stayed at Fifteen after winning an award for showing a big improvement in his skills. He is now cooking at Tom Aikens in Chelsea. 'My strongest memory of Fifteen is getting terrible burns on my arms because my uniform was too short. Jamie made like he didn't care. I realised that in the kitchen, getting hurt is an occupational hazard. Working in a restaurant is tough and you've just got to get on with it.' Before joining Jamie's Kitchen , Ralph had taken his GCSEs and A-levels and then dropped out of an art foundation course to work in a pub. Kerryann Dunlop, 20 Graduated She is currently working as an assistant pastry chef at Baker &amp; Spice in Chelsea. 'Cooking is the only thing I'm good at. I'm relieved Jamie gave me the chance to discover that.' Kerryann grew up in Hackney, east London, and qualified as a silver-service waitress before being recruited for Fifteen. The losers Michelle Cooper, 26 Failed The outspoken single mum was booted off the course after clashes with Jamie over commitment and her constant late arrival. After leaving, Michelle told friends she and her eight-year-old daughter were 'living off fish fingers' in a house in Wandsworth. In fact, a newspaper revealed, she had turned to prostitution to make ends meet. Working under the name 'Karen', Michelle charged \u00a3150 a night. When she was exposed as the 'Cooker Hooker' she said: 'Oh my God. I knew this would happen.' She now says: 'Life on the game was a nightmare. I was desperate and broke, so I did some things I didn't like. I'm not working as an escort ever again. I know that Jamie meant to give me a chance to be someone and I feel like I've let him down and I've let me down.' Lindsay Bell, 20 Failed She quit Fifteen after deciding that she didn't want to work in a restaurant. Lindsay went travelling for a year, mainly in America. She says: 'Jamie showed me that if you are going to be a chef you have to be prepared to dedicate your whole life to it. Working at Fifteen showed me I did not have what it takes to do that.' She is living at home with her parents. Michael Pizzey, 19 Failed He quit Jamie's Kitchen after a series of angry outbursts. He has returned to college to study catering: 'I've wanted to be a chef since I was five but, because of my problems I didn't think I'd be able to do it. I'm glad that Jamie took me on. I'm sorry I could not do it for him.' Michael had always been in trouble at school, due to his dyslexia. He was also diagnosed at 16 with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Roberto di Mambro, 23 Failed The star pupil was the first to leave Jamie's Kitchen . He quit, saying he could not made ends meet. 'I enjoyed cooking with Jamie but I want to work more in wine than food,' he says. Before working at Fifteen, Roberto was a wine taster for Marks &amp; Spencer. He has lost touch with fellow trainees and producers at Channel 4. Julakha 'Jools' Sikdher, 21 Failed Left halfway through her training saying she could not stand the atmosphere. 'It was very competitive, very high pressure - as I suppose it was bound to be when you have a bunch of teenagers cooped up in a hot kitchen.' She is living with her parents in east London and working as a commis chef in a local gastro pub. Nicola Andronicou, 19 Failed She was always late for training at Fifteen and eventually got the sack. 'The hours were weird and it was hard to work evenings. Jamie was encouraging but I could not live up to what he wanted,' she says. After leaving the kitchen she has lost touch with everyone. Nicola Smith, 21 Failed After constantly turning up late she was sacked. She did, however, pass an NVQ while at Fifteen after re-sitting the exam. 'Jamie got me the one qualification I've ever had but I couldn't take his style. It was too full on.' Her NVQ is the only exam she has ever passed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
