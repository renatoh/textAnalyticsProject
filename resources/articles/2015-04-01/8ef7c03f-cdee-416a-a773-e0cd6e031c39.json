Leighton Baines would take the penalties and Baines would score the penalties. Now it seems Everton have entered an era of illogical unpredictability. They have been awarded five spot kicks in 2015. Baines has taken none. Romelu Lukaku has scored three out of three, but Kevin Mirallas, who scored the only goal of the game here, and Ross Barkley have missed once apiece, both at 0-0 in vital home matches. It required an outstanding save from Burnley\u2019s Tom Heaton to deny the Englishman, but goalkeeping brilliance is no explanation for Everton\u2019s curiously cavalier attitude. Their manager, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, spoke of being able to plump from several expert spot-kick takers, yet the sole penalty Barkley has scored in his senior career was for Sheffield Wednesday against Bolton Wanderers in 2012. Perhaps, given a record of excellence from 12 yards that includes 15 conversions from 16 attempts, the laid-back Baines ought to be more demanding. The sense of strangeness about the situation is in keeping with Barkley\u2019s status as the Evertonian enigma. \u201cWe have an incredible character who can become a great, great player,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, who said in November that the 21-year-old would become the finest English player ever. That Barkley was booed at Goodison Park two months later indicates that a much-touted talent is yet to convince many. Perhaps his most auspicious display of the campaign was a bright cameo for England in Italy, rather than anything he has produced in an Everton shirt. The midfielder has been compared to Paul Gascoigne and Michael Ballack by Mart\u00ednez, valued at \u00a350m by Everton and yet Kieran Trippier, the right-back of a Burnley team who prop up the division, has created four times as many goals this season. Barkley\u2019s Premier League career has still yielded only eight goals and one assist, and an opportunity for a statistic-inflating set piece was squandered. Perhaps only Mart\u00ednez, who has an ability to draw a positive from any situation, could derive such satisfaction from seeing one of his charges fail. \u201cOnce you win the game and you can look back at that incident, I\u2019m happier that he missed it because as an experience it doesn\u2019t get any better than wanting to take the responsibility,\u201d he said. If the theory is that adversity is a great educator, given the tone and tenor of underwhelming Everton\u2019s year, Barkley ought to have absorbed much. \u201cHe has learned massively from this demanding season,\u201d Mart\u00ednez added. \u201cHe comes from a World Cup, then all of a sudden he has found expectations, responsibility and an interesting learning curve. He never allowed his standards to drop.\u201d Others might beg to disagree; Barkley seems to have suffered an acute case of second-season syndrome. The Spaniard\u2019s upbeat rhetoric tends to jar with realists in a year of high aims and low achievement. Barkley has been outscored by the centre-back Phil Jagielka, dropped for more prosaic talents and shunted out to the flanks. His ball-carrying ability was apparent in his preferred central role particularly, his manager argued, after the setback of his 10th-minute spot kick. \u201cI was extremely impressed in the manner that he took responsibility: working for the team, doing his job, showing for the ball,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cThe bravery of Ross Barkley is to get on the ball and always be available. I think today we got a better player after that display because of the experience of the penalty.\u201d Yet if the emergence of a local prodigy prompts thoughts of exponential improvement, there is an unpromising precedent. Jack Rodwell was a homegrown talent who did not develop quickly enough. He became more of an asset on the balance sheet than the football pitch. Ultimately his sale to Manchester City, given the canny way David Moyes used the proceeds, proved more beneficial than his presence at Everton. History provides warnings for a player expected to have a bright future. To Barkley\u2019s right on Saturday was Aaron Lennon, excellent against Burnley and enjoying a personal renaissance, but yet to realise the potential he displayed as the teenage breakout star of an earlier England World Cup campaign. \u201cHe is quite a unique player,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said, again displaying his capacity for extravagant praise.
