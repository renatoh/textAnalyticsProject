The Pakistan-based agency said Mullah Omar agreed to leave the southern Afghan city - the regime's headquarters - and head for the mountains within 24-hours following discussions with \"close friends and army commanders\". Under the deal, control of the city will pass to Mullah Naqibullah and Haji Basher. The two are former Afghan resistance commanders who fought against the Soviet invasion. They are not members of the Taliban. US planes bombed Kandahar today, continuing a pattern of relentless strikes on the city and its environs, as reports emerged that a senior adviser to Osama bin Laden was killed in recent US air strike. Mohammed Atef is thought to have died during US air strikes near Kabul, the Afghan capital, according to a US official, who described the evidence of this as \"credible\". \"This guy was Bin Laden's military specialist since the early 1990s, [and is] widely thought to be Bin Laden's successor in the event of his death,\" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Atef, an Egyptian, is believed to have been involved in the planning of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. He has also been indicted for involvement in the US embassy bombings in Africa in 1998. Earlier this year, Atef's daughter married Bin Laden's son, demonstrating the closeness of the Egyptian to the al-Qaida leader. \"This is a devastating blow to the al-Qaida organisation,\" the official said. The focus of the US campaign in Afghanistan has shifted more towards tracking down Bin Laden and al-Qaida leaders, who are thought to be hiding in southern Afghanistan, where the Taliban still retain some control. Pentagon officials have said some senior Taliban and al-Qaida leaders have been killed in recent days, but have offered no names. The US state department has been offering more than \u00a33m for information leading to the capture or conviction of Atef. At Kunduz in the north, the anti-Taliban northern alliance laid siege to the city, backed by US air strikes. The defenders of Kunduz include an estimated 2,000-3,000 foreigners loyal to Bin Laden. Near the city of Herat, by the Iranian border, Taliban forces reportedly vacated an air base, the Afghan Islamic Press reported."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
