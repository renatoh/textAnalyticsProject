That was the word in the Square Mile yesterday as rumours of corporate activity did the rounds. Amec gained 9.75p to 270p amid talk that several of its biggest investors, which include Fidelity, Legal &amp; General and hedge fund Tosca, had been approached by a potential predator to see if they would back a 400p-a-share offer. Speculation centred on US rivals such as Flour, Bechtel and Foster Wheeler, each of which commands higher stock market ratings than Amec. Analysts said there was no doubt that Amec, which trades on a forward price/earnings ratio of around 10, was cheap. However, they doubted whether the company would appeal to a US rival given that its North American operations do not focus on specialist process engineering. Moreover, they said Amec's core UK business did not have the growth potential of its closest competitor, Balfour Beatty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
