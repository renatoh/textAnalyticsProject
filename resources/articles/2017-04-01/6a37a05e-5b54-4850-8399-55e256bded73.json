Senior MPs have called on the government to explain an apparent spike in people being turned down for personal independence payment (PIP), which is a top-up benefit with two components related to the extra costs of daily living and limited mobility for disabled people. Figures obtained by Angela Eagle, the former work and pensions minister, showed that 83,000 people assessed for their eligibility had been given zero scores for both components in the six months between April and October. That compares with 93,000 given a zero score for both components in the previous 12 months. Overall, 134,000 people were awarded zero scores for one or both components in the six-month period to October, suggesting the total figure for 2016-17 will pass 200,000. An analysis by Press Association suggested the rate of zero scores would increase to 14% this year from 13% last year and 8% the year before. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend we\u2019ve noticed about people, from usually passing the PIP criteria or disability living allowance [DLA, its predecessor benefit] criteria to getting fewer points even though they\u2019ve got chronic conditions that are worsening,\u201d Eagle said. \u201cIn the last few weeks, there\u2019s definitely been a spike of people getting zero. The only way that this makes sense is if a whole load of people got DLA without deserving it, but that\u2019s never been my experience of DLA.\u201d Debbie Abrahams, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cThe increasing numbers of zero points assessments raise real concerns about the accuracy of the assessment process, as do the thousands upon thousands of wrong decisions that are overturned at mandatory reconsideration and in the courts.\u201d It comes at at time when ministers are under pressure over the number of PIP decisions that are overturned on appeal, with about 65% of rulings reversed at an independent tribunal. This compares with 18% of those being overturned at mandatory reconsideration, a system run by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) that claimants must go through before appealing to a tribunal. More than 160,000 people initially denied PIP have had the decision overturned since the benefit launched in 2013, according to Department for Work and Pensions figures. The DWP said it was \u201ccompletely unfounded\u201d to suggest there was any crackdown that was leading more people to be awarded zero scores at their assessments. It said there were more people being given higher awards of the PIP than under the old system. \u201cIn fact, 27% of claimants are now receiving the highest rate of support under PIP, compared with just 15% under the outdated DLA,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cAssessments are carried out by qualified health professionals and decisions are made based on information provided by the claimant and their GP.\u201d The assessments for PIP are carried out by the private companies Capita and Atos. A Capita spokeswoman said: \u201cOur assessors are healthcare professionals and are equipped with the knowledge, skills and training to understand how both physical and mental health challenges impact a claimant\u2019s daily function. All assessments are carried out in line with the latest DWP guidelines, and the decision to award a benefit is made by DWP.\u201d A spokesman for Atos said: \u201cAll decisions on awarding benefits are made by the DWP.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
