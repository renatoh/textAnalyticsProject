Butterflies are one of the best studied insect groups and because of their short lifespan are particularly vulnerable to environmental threats. \"They are very sensitive to change,\" said Martin Warren, director of Butterfly Conservation in Dorset and one of the study's authors. This means they can act as harbingers of future declines in other species. \"The picture's pretty depressing,\" said Dr Warren. \"A lot of quite widespread species are declining. [That] has big implications for the ecosystem.\" The survey, which is reported today by New Scientist magazine, gathered data on 576 butterfly species from 45 countries. \"The picture in Britain is dreadful,\" said Dr Warren, with seven in 10 British species dropping. Things are worse in central Europe. In Belgium, over three-quarters of its species are in freefall. Overall, the study signalled an 11% fall in the habitat occupied by butterflies over 25 years, with the sharpest declines in species specialising in particular habitats. The distribution of grassland, wetland and forest specialists decreased by 19%, 15% and 14% respectively, while generalists suffered only a 1% decline. Seventy-one species are recorded as \"threatened\", according to the World Conservation Union. Habitat loss is a major cause, said Dr Warren. Many butterfly species occupy semi-natural habitats such as pasture managed by farmers. With more intense agriculture and uneconomical farms being abandoned, there is less habitat available. \"That's happening on a massive scale,\" said Dr Warren. Another problem is the loss of wetlands as they are drained for agriculture. This has increased markedly in eastern European countries as they have intensified farming methods since the fall of the Berlin wall. \"The problem may be exacerbated now that their markets are becoming more open,\" the researchers write in the Journal of Insect Conservation. This is a particularly serious potential threat as these countries hold a disproportionate large number of threatened butterflies.\" A third threat is climate change, which is forcing species northwards as their traditional range becomes too hot. A quarter of British species are shifting north. The increased use of herbicides and pesticides is also partly to blame. The study, carried out with Chris van Swaay at Dutch Butterfly Conservation in Wageningen and Gr\u00e9goire Lo\u00efs at the European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity in Paris, will make depressing reading for EU environment ministers who have committed themselves to halting biodiversity loss by 2010. Because butterflies are so well studied, they are one of the few groups which allow scientists to track progress towards that goal, said Dr Warren. But his study suggests there is little hope of achieving it.
