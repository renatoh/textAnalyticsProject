Scientists believe the \u201castonishing\u201d drop in bogong moth numbers is linked to climate change and recent droughts in areas where the moths breed. At the same time checks on the endangered mountain pygmy possum, which exists only in Australia\u2019s alpine regions, have revealed dead litters in the pouches of females. The moths are a key food source for the possums as they wake from hibernation. In 2018, scientists revealed bogong moths were the only known insect to use the earth\u2019s magnetic field to help them navigate from grasslands in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland \u2013 sometimes at distances of 1,000km. Around two billion moths are estimated to make the journey. The ecologist Dr Ken Green has been monitoring bogong moths for 40 years. He said: \u201cLast summer numbers were atrocious. It was not just really bad, it was the worst I had ever seen. Now this year it\u2019s got even worse.\u201d The moths find caves and cracks in boulders to hide away in a torpor state. A cave at Mount Gingera, near Canberra, has been known to house millions of the moths but last month Green and colleagues counted just three individuals. Searches of about 50 known sites have turned up similar catastrophic absences. \u201cThey haven\u2019t just declined. They\u2019ve gone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have done mountains from down to the Victorian border all the way to Canberra. We have checked every cave we know.\u201d A site at South Ramshead in the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales had just 1,000 moths last year. \u201cThat is very, very low,\u201d says Green. \u201cThis year we found just six moths. Last week we went back and there were none.\u201d Green believes the cause of the crash is drought in the moth\u2019s breeding areas. The Bureau of Meteorology has said the drought was exceptional in those areas, but noted there had been similar dry periods in the 1960s and earlier. Impact on the endangered mountain pygmy possums Dean Heinze, an associate at Latrobe University, has been monitoring and researching mountain pygmy possums since the early 1990s. The possum populations are spread across Kosciuszko national park in New South Wales, and in Victoria at Mount Bogong, Mount Higginbotham and Mount Buller. As the possums emerge from hibernation in September and October, the moths are a key food source as they breed and raise young. \u201cBogong moths are an incredible food source and very high in protein. Last year we found that some populations of possums were losing litters. It\u2019s happening again this year. We think that the fewer moths means the possums are carrying less weight and losing the litters.\u201d In recent weeks Heinze has visited about 12 locations in Victoria and discovered dead litters in female pouches at \u201cmost of the sites.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a widespread event,\u201d he said. \u201cI inspect the reproductive system of the animal and I look in their pouch to see how many young there are. I have been opening pouches and discovering dead and decomposing young ... For some, the young have been dead for days. \u201cThe concern is that over time, if this happens more frequently we will see declines in the adult population as well. And this is the second year that they have lost litters. The litmus test will be next season.\u201d Around Mount Buller in Victoria, the possum habitat is fragmented by ski resorts. Captive breeding and release programs have been used to keep numbers up. \u201cWe have put a huge effort into the population at Mount Buller,\u201d says Heinze. \u201cWe have brought the population back from the brink and now we have this happening. I\u2019m optimistic, but if we get more of this then it doesn\u2019t look good. Here we are dealing with a species that only occurs in the alps, but what\u2019s impacting it is happening hundreds of kilometres away.\u201d In 2016, a national recovery plan was agreed for the possum, outlining multiple threats including habitat degradation, predation by invasive cats and foxes and climate change. A study published in October 2018 and led by scientists at the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage looked at the climate change threats to the possums and the moths. The study suggested the moths had a \u201creduced survival in a warmer world\u201d and this would \u201clikely further affect survival\u201d of the possums. Prof Lesley Hughes, an ecologist at Macquarie University and councillor at the Climate Council of Australia, said the potential role of climate change in the decline of the moths and possums were what ecologists and climate scientists had predicted. \u201cUnfortunately the general predictions of the ecological risks of climate change are now turning into observations for particular species. And it should be no surprise we are seeing these impacts in the alpine zone, long recognised as one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to climate risks. \u201cSometimes these changes can appear to happen abruptly \u2013 one year there are millions of moths and the next almost none. This shows how particular extreme events, such as droughts or severe bushfires, can suddenly tip a species over the edge, with flow-on effects to others in the ecosystem.\u201d The environment minister, Melissa Price, said she was aware of the reports of low bogong moth numbers and the government was working with a leading possum researcher \u201cto understand the potential toll that reduced number of moths may be having on the species\u201d. The removal of feral cats and foxes in Kosciusko national park was helping possum protection, she said, and two government-backed projects were tackling weed infestations, building resilience to climate change, and managing loss of genetic diversity among possums in the Victorian Alpine region. Victoria\u2019s Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning spokesperson Adrian Moorrees said the reduction in moths \u201cis likely to be due to recent droughts\u201d in NSW and Queensland. He said tools and processes were being developed \u201cto better monitor and predict the impact of bogong moth populations on endangered mountain pygmy possums.\u201d A spokesperson for the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage said no litter deaths were reported in NSW possum populations, but the drought was believed to have impacted most species. He said when moth numbers were low, possums turned to other food sources, including insects, fruits and nectar, adding \u201cOEH will continue to implement the species recovery plans for the mountain pygmy possum.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
