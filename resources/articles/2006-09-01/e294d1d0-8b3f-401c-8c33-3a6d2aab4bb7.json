How are the realms of faith and reason to be reconciled, especially as reason extends the range of human possibility? Can the two live side by side or is religion incompatible with the exercise of intellect? For an atheist such as Richard Dawkins, the answer is self-evident. We must deploy reason to recognise that religion is a cruel self-deception. There is no God. But while Western societies are ever more secular, there remains an underlying sentiment that will not abandon God altogether. Could the faith that succoured our ancestors and contributed so mightily to our culture be built on sand? Most Europeans may not go to church, but few openly repudiate God and commit to atheism. The West cannot simply be identified as amoral and secular. More accurately, we live in a tension between a healthy secular agnosticism and a recognition of the value of Christian moral truths. For example, at times of crisis, churches fill. I have been taken aback by the choice of almost all my rational, agnostic friends who have died unfairly early to have church funerals. And all of us mourners, despite our secularity and daily unconcern by any issue of faith, go along and are deeply touched by the experience. Something is going on that gets under our skin. At the University of Regensberg last week, the Pope addressed these issues in a speech entitled 'Faith, reason and the university'. He argued that, properly understood, there is no tension between faith and reason; the spirit of free intellectual inquiry at a university is perfectly compatible with belief in Christian faith. From the beginning, Christianity was a religion ready to engage with the 'breadth of reason and not the denial of its grandeur'. Faith and reason were mutually enriched. The Pope reinforced his argument by saying that true belief had to be arrived at by a process of reasoned and voluntary reflection and could not be imposed, especially by violence. In fact, violence was incompatible with any religion. To prove his point, he cited a 14th-century Byzantine emperor who made the same argument, but who went on to say Mohammad offended this universal principle. Islam's teaching were only 'evil and inhuman' because he invoked his followers to 'spread them by the sword' and not by reason. Before 9/11, it would just have been another papal speech. But 9/11 has happened. The Pope knew precisely what he was doing. He was finding a way to say that Christianity is a superior faith to Islam because it is more inherently capable of accommodating reason. The reaction has been no less predictable. His planned visit to Turkey hangs in the balance. His effigy has been burned across the Islamic world. He has given gross offence to Muslims, claim Islamic leaders, and must apologise. Relations between Islam and Roman Catholicism have plunged to a new low. This is the clash of civilisations before our eyes. In one respect, the Pope deserves the response, not least because he must know he is wrong. Mohammad and the Koran's appeal to the sword has its counterpart in Jesus's: 'I came not to send peace, but a sword.' In fact, as Reza Aslan explains in a remarkable book, No god but God, Islam is a peaceful, egalitarian and intensely decent faith. Mohammad would not have condoned 9/11 or other acts of Islamic terrorism any more than any Christian or Jewish prophet. The universe of jihads, fatwas and murderous terrorism has no validation in what Mohammad preached. Nor is Islam less able to accommodate reason or Enlightenment values. Indeed, Aslan argues that Islamic concepts such as shura (tribal consultation) and ijma (rule of judge made law) are perfectly compatible with representative democracy and government accountability and that, bit by bit, an Islamic Enlightenment is under way. Fundamentalist terror should be seen as a reaction to the enlightenment process through which Islam is going, but should not disguise its underlying capacity to arrive at the same destination as Christianity. Aslan is persuasive, but the reaction of some Islamic leaders to the Pope's incitement belies his optimism. They can choose to ignore the pontiff, challenge him or demonstrate through reference to Islam's own teachings that he is wrong. Instead, they stress the enormous offence that has been given. There is no sense here of a commitment to pluralism or mutual tolerance. The basic belief is of the superiority of Islamic faith expressed in multiple ways. In extreme forms, this asymmetry of belief insists that Britain must accept Islamic norms about the treatment of women, say, or gays with no reciprocal acknowledgement that Islamic citizens should accept British norms. It is seen, too, in the infamous letter from Labour Muslim MPs to the Prime Minister asserting that British foreign policy had incited British Islamic youth to terrorism. The implicit message was that Britain should recognise the validity of an Islamic morality that excuses the murder of innocents to register political protest. Such illogic needs to be challenged. Yes, Islam is a great and peaceful religion. Islam is as capable as Christianity of reconciling faith and reason. It is, however, only one great faith among many. It has no claim to be especially venerated by others, any more than it should accept such a claim if made for it. The only endgame has to be the peaceful co-existence between religions that Mohammad himself required of his followers. Which is why we in the West can condemn the Pope's ignorance and wilful incitement of another religion. The principle of tolerance is one on which the West can never compromise. The Pope was right on one thing, though; the West, its religions included, accepts the grandeur of reason. So, ultimately, must Islam."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
