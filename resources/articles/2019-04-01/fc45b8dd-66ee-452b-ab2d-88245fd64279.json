The striker was dismissive of comparisons between United\u2019s comeback against Paris Saint-Germain and the task after a 1-0 first-leg defeat against Barcelona, saying the team \u201chave to improve and do better than we did in Paris\u201d. He was plain about what will be key at Camp Nou. \u201cTaking our chances and not conceding a goal, and play with more heart and bollocks,\u201d he said, mouthing the last word. Lukaku was unimpressed with the level of much of United\u2019s performance. \u201cWe have to believe and have the desire and more quality. Be better on the ball and then you never know what can happen in football. \u201cI don\u2019t think we played with the same arrogance and confidence on the ball [early on]. Second half we tried and the first 20 minutes of the second half we were there. It\u2019s something we have to do for the whole 90 minutes over there and not concede a goal and score early.\u201d On eight occasions Barcelona have taken a 1-0 lead into the second leg of a European tie at Camp Nou and they have progressed in seven of them, the exception coming in the 1980-81 Uefa Cup when K\u00f6ln won 4-0. Yet Paul Pogba believes United can cause a surprise if they can be \u201ckillers in front of goal\u201d. They did not have a shot on target at Old Trafford but Pogba is confident the tie is far from settled. \u201cWe saw a team we can beat,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe that then you just let them go through. We believe we can beat them. They are Barcelona but we are Manchester United and we play in the Champions League like they do and we can go through.\u201d The midfielder feels Bar\u00e7a could be affected by United\u2019s recovery from 2\u20110 down in the previous round. \u201cProbably PSG will be in their minds, because they saw what we can do. They will be comfortable on their own pitch but let\u2019s see.\u201d Pogba acknowledged United will need to be at their best on Tuesday. \u201cWe have to avoid giving them chances and be killers in front of goal \u2026 We know we can hurt them as well as they can hurt us.\u201d He refused to respond to a question from Spanish media as to whether he would like to face Barcelona in a cl\u00e1sico, having said in March that playing for Real Madrid would be \u201ca dream for anyone\u201d. Pogba, who has described himself as happy at United, was then asked whether he was staying at the club. \u201cI only talk about the match, not about other things,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
