Dozens of people demonstrated outside the main government office in Quito on Monday to protest against a plan they described as a threat to the world heritage site\u2019s unique environment \u2013 and an attack on Ecuador\u2019s sovereignty. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, 563 miles west of the South American continent, are renowned for their unique plants and wildlife. Unesco describes the archipelago \u2013 visited by a quarter of a million tourists every year \u2013 as a \u201cliving museum and a showcase for evolution\u201d. Ecuador\u2019s defence minister, Oswaldo Jarr\u00edn, provoked patriotic and environmental outrage last week when he said that US aircraft would be able to use the airbase on San Crist\u00f3bal Island, and described the islands as a \u201cnatural aircraft carrier\u201d. The former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa tweeted: \u201cGal\u00e1pagos is NOT an \u2018aircraft carrier\u2019 for gringo use. It is an Ecuadorian province, world heritage site, homeland.\u201d Correa \u2013 once a close ally but now a bitter enemy of his successor, Len\u00edn Moreno \u2013 accused the government of capitulating to US pressure. Correa closed a US military base in Manta in 2008, changing the constitution to ban foreign military bases on Ecuadorian soil and in 2014 ordered all US defence department staff to leave the country. But Ecuador\u2019s foreign minister, Jos\u00e9 Valencia, told the Guardian that Correa\u2019s argument sought to \u201cmaliciously distort what was completely legitimate international cooperation against drug trafficking\u201d. He said the US aircraft \u2013 specially equipped to trace small craft which might be carrying drugs \u2013 would pass through the airbase once or twice a month to refuel, or to make an emergency stop. \u201cThe argument that it would have an environmental impact is totally false,\u201d Valencia added. The islands receive 252 tourist flights every month and a total of 3,097 in 2018, he explained. Drug trafficking is a growing problem in Ecuador. The former head of the General Directorate of Civil Aviation was arrested on Sunday in connection with the 2018 seizure of more than a ton of cocaine, along with a current official of the same agency, three soldiers and an active-duty police officer. \u201cThere is not nor will there be a foreign military base,\u201d Norman Wray, president of the Gal\u00e1pagos government council, said in a statement last week. But the islands\u2019 governor did admit to a deal with the US to improve the runway at the San Crist\u00f3bal airport while allowing the \u201crefueling of two planes monitoring illegal activities in the extensive marine reserve\u201d. He said the US aircraft would monitor drug trafficking and illegal fishing, particularly from foreign fishing fleets. Last week, lawmakers in Quito voted to summon Jarr\u00edn and the environment minister, Marcelo Mata, to explain the scope of the cooperation with the US on the islands, which are considered one of the last near pristine wildernesses on the planet. Opposition MP Brenda Flor said the archipelago should be considered a \u201cliving and unique laboratory which we must protect\u201d. On Monday, Jarr\u00edn said his \u201caircraft carrier\u201d remark was a reference to the islands\u2019 geographic location in the Pacific Ocean rather than a place where aircraft could land. Speaking to local radio, he said only one US aircraft, a Lockheed P-3 Orion, would stop off at the island airport every month for refuelling, or in emergency situations. \u201cThere will not be a permanent presence, there will not be a base,\u201d the minister said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
