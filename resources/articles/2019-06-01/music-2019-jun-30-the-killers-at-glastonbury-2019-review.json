One rumour circulating around the audience is that they were the third choice for the Saturday night headlining slot, drafted in after big name heritage artists declined to sign up. Whether that\u2019s true or not, something about Brandon Flowers\u2019 demeanour onstage, at least initially, suggests a man who isn\u2019t entirely sure how things are going to pan out. \u201cAt the end of this show, I don\u2019t want anyone to say \u2018They got away with it,\u2019\u201d he offers, early on in the band\u2019s set. \u201cI want people to look up to this stage and say: \u2018Those are the sons of bitches that did it.\u2019\u201d Certainly, you\u2019re stuck by the sense of a band who both understand the importance of a headlining slot \u2013 the Killers\u2019 2004 performance at the festival played a considerable part in their rise to success \u2013 and are determined to prove their worth. Indeed, if Flowers worked any harder to win over the crowd, he\u2019d be down among them smearing them with after-sun cream and asking if they want him to pop to a stall and get them some Rizlas. He asks them \u201cAre we on the same page?\u201d He turns everything into an act of audience participation, up to and including counting in a song. He pretends to be overcome with emotion during a lull in Glamorous Indie Rock and Roll, then slyly raises his eyebrows and beckons for more applause. As with Stormzy\u2019s set, from the opening moment, every song arrives strafed with lazers or pyrotechnics or confetti cannons. It works, aided by the fact that the Killers\u2019 songs \u2013 which stretch from heartland American rock\u2019n\u2019roll to its diametric opposite, Bee Gees-influenced disco, on The Man \u2013 are all designed to be successful. Filled with grabby hooks, they\u2019re perfect for the situation the band find themselves in. The audience begin singing along to the opening, Jenny Was a Friend Of Mine, and don\u2019t stop. For a band whose career has theoretically tailed off slightly since the multi-platinum-selling era of their debut, Hot Fuss, and 2004\u2019s Day and Age, they have an impressive store of anthemic songs: Spaceman, Somebody Told Me, All These Things That I Have Done. There\u2019s something impressively relentless about their set: it never lags, there are no longeurs. By the time they bring out the Pet Shop Boys to perform Always on My Mind, and Johnny Marr to race through a version of the Smiths\u2019 This Charming Man, the deal is already sealed \u2013 their performance feels like a triumph. But the sight of Flowers, a noted Pet Shop Boys and Smiths obsessive, living out his dreams on stage provides it with something else: one of those elusive Glastonbury Moments festivalgoers talk so much about. Indeed, it\u2019s hard not look up at the stage and say: those are the sons of bitches that did it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
