Andy Duncan of Channel 4's plea for public funds (Media Letters, December 6) might sound slightly less hypocritical if his channel hadn't recently spent large sums of money to poach The Simpsons from BBC2, clearly demonstrating that \"innovative content\" is to be equated with a highly successful 10-year-old American import previously available to terrestrial viewers via the existing PSB provider. One can instance previous spoiling techniques, such as the snatching of Buffy spin-off Angel, also from BBC2, after the BBC had nurtured a large audience following the muted initial Sky broadcast, only to botch its transmission by either showing an emasculated version in an inappropriate early evening slot or, eventually, an irregular, fuller version when only VCRs were other than comatose. If C4 is to benefit from a PSB bonus it will have to offer \"innovative content\" better than either this or make-over and sex shows. Charles Collins London We are deafened by silence Your article exploring the \"newsworthiness\" of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was a much-needed expos\u00e9 of the media silence and concomitant popular ignorance surrounding international development (How to Sell the Poor, MediaGuardian, November 29). The Beyond Access project, set up at the start of 2003 to circulate knowledge about the MDG on gender and education, has met with an almost complete lack of interest from a press who seemingly will only publish stories that have shock or \"quirk\" value. However, unwittingly Murray Armstrong proved his own point. His exposition of the lack of awareness surrounding the MDGs includes a \"month by month\" programme of key development events in 2005, but next year's most important development landmark, the reaching of the first MDG deadline for gender equality, has been missed off the list. The media silence around the complex background to gender inequalities in education is deafening, and is one reason why next year's goal seeking equality of access to education for boys and girls worldwide will be comprehensively missed. Nearly two-thirds of children out of school are girls and, until gender equality is achieved, it is unlikely that the remaining MDGs will be met in 2015. For instance, it is estimated that every extra year a girl spends at school could reduce child mortality by 10%. We hope that the MDGs do make the press next year and that people see them as expressing a vision for a fairer and more equal world. We also hope we will not be writing a similar version of this letter this time next year. Chloe Challender and Elaine Unterhalter University of London Time to open the entry barriers No, Peter Bazalgette, it is not the profits of the so-called \"super-indies\" that we find offensive, or your \u00a31.49m take-home pay (Why Small Can Be Beautiful, MediaGuardian, December 6). Or even demeaning and derivative programming. It is that despite undoubted commercial success - on average the top 10 indies each earn \u00a360m a year from 40 broadcast commissions - you still demand protection by a 25% quota introduced a generation ago to support the then nascent independent sector. In other business sectors, the special needs of SMEs (small and medium size businesses) are recognised. If we returned to parliament's original intention and the quota was restricted to broadcast's own SMEs, the \"super-indies\" would still get the cream, but at least they would be competing in a fair and open market and the entry barriers for new producers would disappear. Martin Jackson Pentacom Consultants, Kent Pipped by a squeaker Mark Thompson says [in his speech on Tuesday] that the BBC is the \"greatest force for cultural good on the face of the earth\". This man clearly has not travelled widely, has no idea of the relevance of the BBC on the back streets of Cairo, Abidjan, San Paulo, Seoul, Beijing or Bucharest. Outside the English speaking world the BBC is irrelevant. Sometimes I wonder if these people still have maps with swathes of red on, tastefully hung in their extravagant colonial offices. Please BBC, get real. You are an excellent quality national broadcast channel, much loved in the UK and well respected in the relatively small number of global locations where your channels reach the dish. But please do not overestimate your sense of importance in the scheme of things. You are a mouse, not a lion, in the global media jungle.
