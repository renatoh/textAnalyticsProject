The speech would tell what change Labour's next decade would bring. The answer? The man himself is that change. He might have reminded us of Gandhi's famous exhortation, \"We must be the change we wish to see\". Leaders these days, as ever following American political fashions, must now be the embodiment of the policies they stand for. Their life stories must be the living parable that tells the people where they come from, drawing from their past a graphic narrative of where they are going. Identity and authenticity must personify their ideas. Where did Brown's conviction and moral compass come from? Out came the old family tales of Kirkaldy, the values of his father's sermons enjoining him to \"treat everyone equally, with respect\" and his father's favourite parable of the talents. Picture the humble local state primary and the bus up the hill to secondary school with the friends who have shared the good times and the bad, some who made it and some left behind through lack of opportunity. There too was the tragedy of nearly losing his sight, with the tender love and care from NHS doctors and nurses that makes him the services passionate defender. For a man they said could never do modern, touchy-feely politics, he does it well and the story does indeed resonate with his policies. So now his story is the nation's own narrative too. Nothing so vulgar as \"Match that, Eton boy!\" passed his lips. Indeed, no politics, no parties, no cheap jibes or squalid electioneering interrupted this solemn Father of the Nation oration, despite the fevered speculation in the hall. If turning a complicated life into a celebrity story makes toes curl and teeth grind at something plainly out of character, these days politics is personal. They take a risk in making cerebral, serious Gordon Brown what he isn't. Hiring Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to produce \"Not Flash - Just Gordon\" might devalue that very currency of honesty he stands for. Beware the image makers. Beware too the verge of jingoism in his old-world Britishness riff. So how much change will the Brown era bring? Nothing in this speech signalled significant policy shift, only a change in emphasis. It was almost vegetarian in its lack of new beef, with not one bold stride into bullish new territory. This was more a steam-cleaning of New Labour policies, renewing what worked, building on went before - with many salutary reminders of how much good there is to be built on. His genuine passion to see every child gets a fair chance in life wasn't the usual perfunctory couple of paragraphs, now obligatory for Tories too, but his own solid core underpinning everything else he said. He left no doubt that this is his purpose and how he will judge himself in the end, a Labour passion that always came more naturally to him than Blair. But this is an odd time and this was an odd event, less a conference than an election rally. There never was in living memory a conference for any party of such strange unity, almost unnerving, defying all the natural rules of politics. Can there be no glimmer of a cabal or caucus anywhere, a leader complete master of all he surveys? Mrs Thatcher had her wets, Blair had his Brown. Brown will find grit in his oyster too. Experience says it can't last long. No doubt he read with quiet satisfaction the latest Populus poll showing 73% agree that he has represented no lurch to the left and that \"the Labour party is never going to return to old Labour\". Indeed this is not a hall full of old Labour lurchers but earnest activists yearning to win again. Nonetheless, if in his listening mode he were to take note of what gets claps and cheers at packed fringe meetings, he would hear a party that yearns too for more radicalism. Surely Labour has earned it after three wins in a row? There was applause at any mention of gross boardroom excess and alarm at the widening wealth gap. There was enthusiastic praise for Brown's poverty programmes at home and abroad - but a strong sense too that politically that doesn't grip public imagination without a critique of greed. Brown's solitary reference to this was shamefully cowardly: \"The right of company boards to make their own decisions, but obligations to the rest of society too,\" was all he said. Opposition to faith schools draws another cheer: what is Labour doing increasing them? There was a chorus of concern about low pay and women's pay. He should listen too to the claps at mentions of eroded civil liberties. There were sighs and head shakings over the money wasted on Trident. These are not old fellow-travellers but those who know how miserably tight the spending round will be. Stop and talk to these delegates and every one of them is engaged professionally or as volunteers in good works of all varieties, needing funds for all that is still to be done. But there is not, say Brown's people, any intention of raising taxes when spending shrinks. These are totemic Labour questions, things that define why people join, why they trudge about the streets whenever an election summons them, why they bother to meet on wet Thursdays in winter. They liked the mood music, they like the man, they think he's their winner, but even as they cheered him before he began to speak, many wistfully missed that extra edge, the sharper blade to fight the battle ahead. But commentators do well to remember how easy it is to stand on the sidelines and urge Labour to be braver and more radical, when no one knows how far it's safe to go. Incremental improvement may be all the country wants, not excitement and political panache. Focus groups and polls will always warn Labour to stay rooted to the centre ground. Giving conviction free rein might be a sign of great leadership, but then it might take the party galloping over the precipice again. Brown belongs to the scarred generation, seared by 18 years of failure: hubris will never be his failing, but caution might. However, at meetings round the conference there were plenty of reminders that now at the cabinet table sits the new generation who say they would and could be bolder in future, who see the missed opportunities and the mistakes of the last decade. One said with glee that another election victory would banish the old fears and \"finally, once and for all, see off the Daily Mail and all it stands for\". But will that be the boss's view? Probably not. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
