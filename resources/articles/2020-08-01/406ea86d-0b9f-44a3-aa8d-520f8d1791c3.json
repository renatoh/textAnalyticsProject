We\u2019ll be back tomorrow for all Monday\u2019s news. Bernie Sanders says Trump\u2019s attacks on mail-in voting a \u2018crisis for US democracy\u2019. The Vermont senator has said Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on mail-in voting and his administration\u2019s efforts to block funds for the US post office amount to \u201ca crisis for American democracy\u201d ahead of the November presidential election. Postmaster general\u2019s changes causing mail delays, USPS workers say. Workers at the United States Postal Service say changes being implemented by recently appointed postmaster general and major Trump donor Louis DeJoy are causing major delays, with mail carriers struggling to keep up. Jared Kushner will \u2018absolutely\u2019 send his children to school despite Covid-19 risks. The White House adviser and son-in-law of the president has said he will \u201cabsolutely\u201d send his children back to school when classes reopen, despite widespread concerns that in-person learning puts children, faculty and their families at risk from Covid-19. Sanders praises Kamala Harris as \u2018an asset\u2019 to Biden, showing party unity. Bernie Sanders praised Joe Biden\u2019s pick for his running mate on Sunday, as the Democratic party attempted to project an image of unity ahead of this week\u2019s national convention. Trump reportedly seeking summit with Putin. NBC reports the president is seeking to hold a summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin before November\u2019s US presidential election. California wildfire spawns \u2018firenado\u2019 as tornado warning issued amid heatwave. A wildfire in northern California spawned at least one fire tornado \u2013 or \u201cfirenado\u201d \u2013 on Saturday, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a tornado warning as the state continues to endure a heatwave and wildfires. Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior advisor, said the death of Donald Trump\u2019s younger brother was \u201ca very tough moment for the president\u201d . \u201cThe president loved his brother very much,\u201d Kushner said in an appearance on CBS\u2019s Face The Nation on Sunday. \u201cHis brother was very proud of him.\u201d It is \u201cobviously a very tough moment for the president,\u201d Kushner added. \u201cBut he is looking forward to continuing to do great things and make his brother proud.\u201d Robert Trump died on Saturday night aged 71 after being hospitalized in New York, the president said in a statement. \u201cIt is with heavy heart I share that my wonderful brother, Robert, peacefully passed away tonight,\u201d Donald Trump said in a statement. \u201cHe was not just my brother, he was my best friend. He will be greatly missed, but we will meet again. His memory will live on in my heart forever. Robert, I love you. Rest in peace.\u201d Trump had visited his brother in Manhattan\u2019s New York-Presbyterian Hospital after White House officials said Robert had become seriously ill. Officials did not immediately release a cause of death. A wildfire in northern California spawned at least one fire tornado \u2013 or \u201cfirenado\u201d \u2013 on Saturday, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a tornado warning as the state continues to endure a heatwave and wildfires. \u201cExtremely dangerous fire behavior noted on the #LoyaltonFire! Rotating columns and potential for fire whirls,\u201d NWS Reno tweeted on Saturday. NWS Reno later said the \u201ctornadic pyrocumulus has weakened &amp; the immediate threat of tornadic activity has decreased for the #LoyaltonFire,\u201d but warned that \u201cextreme fire behavior will continue into this evening w/new Fire Tornadoes &amp; strong gusts in excess of 60mph remain possible. Stay away from the fire area.\u201d The Loyalton fire in Lassen county, north east of Sacramento, has burned 20,000 acres and was 5% contained by early Sunday, according to CNN. Large wildfires can heat air so much that huge clouds develop. In strong winds, these can rotate and sometimes produce a tornado. A fire tornado caught on film killed one person in 2018. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday reported 5,340,232 cases of coronavirus, an increase of 54,686 cases from its previous count, and said that the number of deaths had risen by 1,150 to 168,696. The CDC reported its tally of cases of the respiratory illness known as Covid-19 as of 4pm ET on 15 August, versus its previous report a day earlier. The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by individual states. A third high school in Georgia\u2019s Cherokee county school district is temporarily ending in-person learning after 500 students were quarantined and 25 tested positive for Covid-19. Creekview high school in the Atlanta suburb of Canton is suspending in-person learning effective immediately through the end of August, a county district spokesperson said. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the decision came after more than a quarter of the 1,800 students taking in-person classes at the high school were directed to quarantine. Creekview will be deep-cleaned on Monday as teachers prepare for the shift to remote learning with online classes scheduled to begin Tuesday. Sunday\u2019s announcement came days after two other Cherokee county high schools, Woodstock and Etowah, made the move to transition to online-only classes after hundreds of their students were quarantined. Located about 30 miles (60km) north of Atlanta, the district serves more than 42,000 students and began its new school year on 3 August. At least 23 members of an Oklahoma State University sorority have tested positive for Covid-19, the school said in a statement on Saturday. The outbreak happened at the off-campus house of the Pi Beta Phi sorority and was detected by rapid-antigen testing done at an off-campus clinic, according to the university. The entire sorority house is in isolation or quarantine after the confirmed cases \u201cand will be prohibited from leaving the facility\u201d, the statement read. The Payne County Health Department will monitor the chapter and perform contract tracing. Oklahoma State was in the headlines in April when football coach Mike Gundy apologized for comments pushing for a swift return to normal activities that critics said demonstrated he was out of touch with the realities of the pandemic. The coronavirus doesn\u2019t appear to have devastated America\u2019s homeless population to the extent public health officials and advocates for the homeless initially feared. Johns Hopkins reported 1,029 new deaths on Saturday from the virus in the US. According to the university\u2019s tally, 169,489 people in the US have died from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic with identified cases exceeding 5 million. Yet researchers don\u2019t know why there appear to be so few outbreaks among the estimated half-million people without housing in the US. The Associated Press reports: \u201cI am shocked, I guess I can say, because it\u2019s a very vulnerable population. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to see in an aftermath,\u201d said Dr. Deborah Borne, who oversees health policy for Covid-19 homeless response at San Francisco\u2019s public health department. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s called a novel virus, because we don\u2019t know.\u201d More than 200 of an estimated 8,000 homeless people in San Francisco have tested positive for the virus, and half came from an outbreak at a homeless shelter in April. One homeless person is among the city\u2019s 69 deaths. In other places with large homeless populations, the numbers are similarly low. In King County, which includes Seattle, more than 400 of an estimated 12,000 homeless residents have been diagnosed. In Los Angeles County, more than 1,200 of an estimated 66,000 homeless people have been diagnosed. It\u2019s slightly higher in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, where nearly 500 of an estimated 7,400 homeless people have tested positive, including nine who died. Health experts say the numbers don\u2019t indicate how widespread the disease is or how it might play out long term. It\u2019s unknown how many people have died of conditions indirectly related to the virus. While the coronavirus may dissipate more easily outdoors than indoors, living outside has its own risks. With public libraries and other places closed, homeless people say they\u2019re short on food and water, restrooms and cash. In San Francisco, 50 homeless people died over an eight-week period in April and May twice the usual rate, said Dr Barry Zevin, medical director of the public health department\u2019s street medicine program. The official causes are pending, but Zevin notes that fentanyl overdoses are rising and stay-at-home orders may prevent people from getting help quickly. He knew isolation could result in more overdoses. \u201cI think that\u2019s happened, and whether it\u2019s more or less than I would have expected, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to be able to forecast something as a problem, do everything you can to prevent it as a problem, but it\u2019s absolutely a case of competing priorities.\u201d White House chief of staff Mark Meadows confirmed California senator Kamala Harris was eligible to serve as vice-president, offering a definitive stance amid Donald Trump\u2019s cheeky refusals to dismiss the false and racist conspiracy theory questioning Harris\u2019 US citizenship and her eligibility to be Joe Biden\u2019s running mate. Meadows was asked in an appearance on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday whether Harris was eligible to become vice president, prompting the chief of staff to answer: \u201cSure.\u201d \u201cThis is not something that we\u2019re going to pursue,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cActually, Jake, you and a number in the media, you all have spent more time on it than anybody in the White House has talking about this.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m more concerned with Kamala Harris\u2019s liberal ideas coming from San Francisco to the rest of America than I am whether she was \u2013 where she was born or anything else,\u201d he added. The Newsweek op-ed that floated the theory was written by John Eastman, a conservative attorney who argues that the US constitution doesn\u2019t grant birthright citizenship. Eastman attempted to sow doubt about Harris\u2019 eligibility based on her parents\u2019 immigration status. Harris\u2019 mother was born in India and her father was born in Jamaica. Trump has danced around the eligibility question on multiple occasions when pressed by the White House press corps, instead referring to Eastman as a \u201cvery highly qualified and very talented lawyer\u201d. Newsweek apologized for an op-ed on Friday, saying it \u201cis being used by some as a tool to perpetuate racism and xenophobia. We apologize.\u201d Mississippi\u2019s Republican governor Tate Reeves says the fact that residents of his state will have to vote in-person during the Covid-19 pandemic is not a problem. \u201cWe do not allow mail-in voting in the state of Mississippi. We think that our election process, which has been in place for many many years, ensures that we have a fair process in which we have the opportunity to limit fraud,\u201d Reeves told CBS on Sunday. According to Johns Hopkins University, Mississippi has the highest positivity rate in the US, with 19.5% of tests coming back positive over the last seven days. Again, Reeves does not see that as a concern. \u201cEvery vote that is legally cast in the state of Mississippi will be counted in the November election and I\u2019m confident that once all of those votes are counted that Donald J Trump is going to win Mississippi and many other states,\u201d Reeves said. Jared Kushner said earlier today that he has no concerns about sending his children back to school \u201cbecause children have a six times higher chance to die from the flu than from the coronavirus, so based on the data I\u2019ve seen I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a risk.\u201d But during an appearance on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot pointed out that school reopening poses a problem for adults too. \u201cIt is not just the students themselves,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cIt is the entire eco-system of the school. You\u2019ve got teachers, you\u2019ve got principals, and you\u2019ve got staff.\u201d She said that many staff in schools are over 60, making them \u201ca vulnerable population.\u201d She added that the federal response to Covid-19 had made the pandemic in the US worse. \u201cThe White House fighting, the CDC, the HHS hijacking reporting processes, we still don\u2019t have a federal mask policy. The chaos at the federal level has not been helpful to anyone, not Chicago, Illinois, or states across the country,\u201d Lightfoot said. Donald Trump has said that the US Postal Service\u2019s well-documented problems ahead of an election that is likely to see a record number of mail-in votes are due to Democrats\u2019 failure to agree an economic stimulus bill with Republicans. On Sunday, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats \u201care looking at having a standalone bill\u201d for the USPS, an idea White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said he would be open to. \u201cSpeaker Pelosi and I are looking at having a standalone bill,\u201d said Schumer. \u201cThe House \u2013 [Pelosi] can call it back into session, she can do that, I hope she will, and then I will ask [Senate majority leader Mitch] McConnell to call the Senate back into session to do a standalone bill.\u201d Encouraging news from southern states as cases of Covid-19 appear to be falling in some hotspots for the disease. Florida reported 3,779 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, the first time there had been fewer than 4,000 cases since 18 June, according to CNN. Meanwhile, Mississippi governor Tate Reeves told CBS that \u201cwe\u2019ve actually cut the total number of cases on a daily basis in half over the last two and a half weeks.\u201d However, Tate admitted that there were issues with ICU capacity in many hospitals across the state. \u201cDo we have hospital capacity issues? We do,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cIn our state and virtually every other rural state across America, we have ICU bed issues and hospital capacity issues even when there\u2019s not Covid-19.\u201d Elsewhere, Arizona reported 883 new cases of Covid-19. In the north of the country, New York reported 607 new cases of the virus. The virus is still taking lives: there were 107 reported new deaths in Florida; 14 in Arizona; and six in New York. The US Postal service says it will not remove any more collection boxes between now and November\u2019s presidential election. There had been complaints some boxes had been removed, which could make it harder for people to use mail-in voting, the popularity of which is expected to rise during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cGiven the recent customer concerns the Postal Service will postpone removing boxes for a period of 90 days while we evaluate our customers concerns,\u201d USPS spokesperson Kim Frum said in a statement. Frum said seldom used boxes are sometimes removed. However, that will not now happen between now and the Election Day. \u201cBased on the density testing, boxes are identified for potential removal and notices are placed on boxes to give customers an opportunity to comment before the removal decision is made. This process is one of the many ways the Postal Services makes adjustments to our infrastructure to match our resources to declining mail volumes,\u201d Frum said. Chicago\u2019s Democratic mayor, Lori Lightfoot, has said outbreaks of violence at an anti-racism protest in the city on Saturday was caused by people looking to cause trouble rather than legitimate demonstrators. Police said that more than a dozen officers were injured during the confrontations. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is people who have embedded themselves in ... seemingly peaceful protests and have come for a fight,\u201d Lightfoot told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. The mayor said violence would not be tolerated at protests. \u201cWhat happened yesterday was really over very quickly, because our police department has resolved to make sure that we protect peaceful protests but we are absolutely not going to tolerate people who come to these protests looking for a fight and are intending to injure our police officers and injure innocent people who have just come to express their First Amendment rights,\u201d she added. Bernie Sanders is doing the rounds on the Sunday talk shows and his latest appearance is on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press. He said that issues the US Postal Service faces as cuts to the agency hinder its chances of handling mail-in votes in November\u2019s election are \u201ca crisis for American democracy\u201d. \u201cThis, again, is not a debate about the postal service alone,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat\u2019s important. This is about the future of American democracy and whether people have a right to participate.\u201d He said Donald Trump had made a \u201cdeliberate effort\u201d to hinder mail-in voting. \u201cI hope the American people come together \u2013 progressives, moderates, conservatives \u2013 to say, \u2018Sorry, Mr President. We may have our disagreements, but in America, we are a democracy. Everybody is going to vote, and we\u2019re not going to let you get away with what you\u2019re doing,\u2019\u201d said the Vermont senator. The postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, will be invited to testify before a House oversight committee on hearing on 24 August. The hearing will look into claims the DeJoy has deliberately made cuts to the US Postal Service that could mean mail-in votes are not counted on time for this November\u2019s presidential election. \u201cThe postmaster general and top Postal Service leadership must answer to the Congress and the American people as to why they are pushing these dangerous new policies that threaten to silence the voices of millions, just months before the election,\u201d read a joint statement from top House Democrats, including speaker Nancy Pelosi. The committee\u2019s chairwoman, Democrat Carolyn Maloney, said DeJoy\u2019s testimony was an \u201curgent\u201d matter. \u201cOver the past several weeks, there have been startling new revelations about the scope and gravity of operational changes you are implementing at hundreds of postal facilities without consulting adequately with Congress, the Postal Regulatory Commission, or the Board of Governors,\u201d she wrote in a letter to DeJoy on Sunday. Trump has denied that DeJoy, a supporter of the president, has set out to harm the postal system ahead of the election. Trump is a vocal critic of mail-in voting, falsely claiming that the system is subject to widespread fraud. Cases of mail-in voting fraud are, in fact, almost non-existent. Trump said in a press briefing on Saturday that DeJoy is, in fact, trying to \u201cmake the post office great again\u201d. For more on the role the USPS and mail-in voting will play in November\u2019s election, you can read my colleague Sam Levine\u2019s excellent guide: White House adviser and son-in-law of the president Jared Kushner said he will send his children back to school when classes reopen. Some teachers, health workers and parents have expressed concern about children returning to school, saying it not only puts children at risk from Covid-19 but also staff and family members who children could pass the virus on to. One public school district in Arizona was forced to cancel plans to reopen on Monday after more than 100 teachers and other staff members called in sick. However, Kushner told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday morning that he had no concerns about his children returning to class \u201cbecause children have a six times higher chance to die from the flu than from the coronavirus, so based on the data I\u2019ve seen I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a risk.\u201d Kushner has three children with Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter. \u201cThis virus impacts different people at different rates,\u201d he said. \u201cOur school\u2019s not opening back up five days a week, I wish they would but we absolutely will be sending our kids back.\u201d Kushner also said he believes that Trump\u2019s opposition to mail-in voting will not discourage people from casting their ballot in this November\u2019s election. \u201cI think what President Trump wants is a fair election. You can\u2019t have a new system being tried where there\u2019s not the right time to do it and then expect them to get it right and expect Americans to have confidence [in the outcome],\u201d he said. The vast majority of Democrats \u2013 and, notably, one in four Republicans \u2013 approve of Joe Biden\u2019s choice of running mate, a new ABC News/Washington Post poll found. Biden\u2019s selection of Harris has exhilarated his supporters, who showered the campaign with $48m in the 48 hours after she was announced as his running mate. The poll found 54% of respondents approved of Biden\u2019s pick of Harris, compared to 29% who were against the choice. Among black voters, 78% said they approved of Harris as vice-presidential candidate, while 54% of white voters approved. It\u2019s only a hundred miles from Manhattan to East Hampton but as the city swelters the Long Island town can seem a world away. Cool Atlantic breezes take the heat off long summer days spent on its miles of white, soft sand beaches. High-priced farm stands provide heirloom tomatoes, peaches and arugula to summer visitors and the mansions of the financial titans and the celebrities, including Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, Julianne Moore and Robert Downey Jr, who summer there. Nor does the coronavirus pandemic seem to have dampened the 1%\u2019s enthusiasm for the Hamptons. If anything, quite the opposite. House prices are soaring. High-priced rentals have all been snapped up. It took developer Joe Farrell just one day to rent Sandcastle, his 15-bedroom mansion with sunken tennis courts, for $2m for the summer to \u201ca textile tycoon and his family who were stuck in Manhattan and wanted to leave the city on a day\u2019s notice. This was a Covid situation \u2013 not a normal summer rental\u201d, he told the New York Post. The Hamptons really is a world away for Sara Fearrington. It may as well be another planet. The 43-year-old lost her job at Waffle House in Durham, North Carolina, when the pandemic struck. Now she, her husband and their six children are trying to make ends meet on $125 in unemployment benefits each week. Fearrington is one of the 2.6 million people to have lost her job in the food services and drinking industry since February. The Fearringtons had been receiving an extra $600 a week in benefits thanks to an emergency lifeline set up by Congress in March. That expired at the end of July and Washington is deadlocked over a replacement. \u201cNow we literally have to sit here and wait, your head on a chopping block,\u201d she said. Once again coronavirus has shown that it is far more deadly for those suffering from pre-existing conditions. For the US body politic that pre-existing condition is inequality. You can read the full article below: CNN has highlighted data from Johns Hopkins University that shows the US has reported more than 1,000 deaths from Covid-19 on 16 of the last 20 days. Johns Hopkins reported 1,029 new deaths on Saturday from the virus in the US. According to the university\u2019s tally, 169,489 people in America have died from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. New Jersey\u2019s Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, says there are plans in place in his state to make sure votes are counted correctly in November\u2019s presidential election. Murphy told Fox News Sunday he would extend the deadline for mail-in votes to be counted in the state, provided the ballots were postmarked for election day. The United States Postal Service has warned it may struggle with an increased demand for mail-in voting during the Covid-19 pandemic as the postmaster general comes under fire for making cuts to the agency. \u201cOur hope is to expand democracy, and we believe this is the right way to do it,\u201d Murphy said. New Jersey has been won by Democrats at every presidential election since 1992. Bernie Sanders has praised Kamala Harris despite dissatisfaction among progressives with the presidential ticket of the California senator and Joe Biden for the Democrats in this November\u2019s election. \u201cI believe that Kamala is incredibly smart, incredibly tough and I would not like to be Vice President Pence in a debate with her \u2026 I think she\u2019s going to be an asset to the campaign,\u201d the Vermont senator told ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday. Sanders has twice run to become the Democrats\u2019 presidential candidate, including this year against Biden. Sanders said that he believes that the progressive wing of the Democrats is stronger than every, despite Biden and Harris, both centrists, fighting this fall\u2019s election. \u201cThe progressive movement has been making enormous progress, not only in electing candidates to congress, not only in electing candidates to state legislatures, but also in electing candidates for district attorney who are transforming criminal justice in America,\u201d Sanders said. He added: \u201cOn all of the ideas that we have been campaigning on, the understanding that health care is a human right, the need to raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour, to understand that climate change is an existential threat\u2026 we have made enormous progress in bringing the American people in our direction, especially the younger generation.\u201d Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, has denied the US Postal Service will dismantle mail-sorting machines before November\u2019s election. There have been a number of reports of sorting machines being taken apart in recent weeks, which could lead to problems with mail-in voting for the election. \u201cThere\u2019s no sorting machines that are going offline between now and the election,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that my Democrat friends are trying to do to stoke fear out there. That\u2019s not happening.\u201d He said that machines being dismantled in recent weeks were part of a pre-planned reallocation, and were not the result of a new policy. Joe Biden has maintained a sizable lead over Donald Trump in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released on Sunday. The presumptive Democratic candidate for president leads the incumbent by nine points nationally (50% to 41%), according to the poll. However, Biden\u2019s lead is down from 11 points when the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll was last conducted in July. The poll had a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points. Trump lost the national vote in 2016 but still won the presidency. Biden was seen as handling healthcare, Covid-19 and race relations best by those polled but Trump was seen as better on crime and the economy. The poll was the first conducted since Biden announced Kamala Harris as his running mate for November\u2019s election. The poll showed the California senator holds a higher approval rating (+4) than Biden (-6), Mike Pence (-5) and Trump (-12). Other polls over the last few months have shown Biden leading or level in key battleground states such as Texas, Arizona and Florida. Donald Trump is mourning his younger brother, Robert, who died in New York on Saturday night at the age of 71. The brothers had remained close as adults, and the president paid tribute to his sibling in a statement issued on Saturday night. A cause of death for Robert Trump has not been disclosed. \u201cIt is with heavy heart I share that my wonderful brother, Robert, peacefully passed away tonight,\u201d Donald Trump said in a statement. \u201cHe was not just my brother, he was my best friend. He will be greatly missed, but we will meet again. His memory will live on in my heart forever. Robert, I love you. Rest in peace.\u201d You can read more on the story below: NBC reports that Donald Trump is seeking to hold a summit with Vladimir Putin before November\u2019s US presidential election. NBC sources said the summit between the presidents of the US and Russia could take place as early as next month in New York, and would involve discussion of a treaty on nuclear arms control. Trump is understood to want to hold the summit in order to look presidential and show he can negotiate a high-level deal. \u201cHe wants it to show his deal-maker abilities,\u201d one of NBC\u2019s sources said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a big stage.\u201d However, some of the president\u2019s advisers are reportedly opposed to the meeting given claims that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in order to help Trump gain the White House. It would also come shortly after reports Russia offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill US troops in Afghanistan. The White House and Kremlin have not made any comment on the potential summit. Good morning. The pressure on the postmaster general, Louis Dejoy, remains on today. He stands accused of deliberately cutting back on services at the United States Postal Service to hamper mail-in voting in this presidential election. Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced his opposition to mail-in voting, falsely claiming it is subject to widespread fraud. DeJoy is a long-time ally of the president, and Trump said on Saturday that the postmaster general is \u201ctrying to make the post office great again\u201d. Trump has blamed problems at the USPS on Democrats\u2019 failure to agree funding in Congress. On Saturday, House majority whip James Clyburn said Trump\u2019s opposition to mail-in voting is dangerous, particularly when many people want to vote remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWe ought not be crippling the Post Office and for the president to admit that he is doing this in order to gum up the works when it comes to the elections, he is actually signing a death warrant for a lot of people that he ought not be doing this,\u201d Clyburn said on CNN.
