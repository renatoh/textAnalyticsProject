His pulsating win in the second semi-final also bolstered the suspicion that the Swiss's decline is turning from gradual to terminal. That might be a tough call on a 29-year-old genius who has won 16 grand slams, the most recent of them in January, but Federer has set such high standards for so long that falling short again after Wimbledon, added to his quarter-final exit in Paris, suggests he will struggle to stay at or near the summit. Djokovic won 5-7, 6-1, 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 in six minutes short of four hours and came off court physically drained but spiritually uplifted at the prospect of contesting the title against Nadal. He deserves to be there, no question. Some of the Serb's fighting tennis was sublime, particularly after losing a desperately close first set, and he put such pressure on Federer that his game unravelled at key moments, most spectacularly in the second set, which went by in a mere 29 minutes. \"It's hard to describe my feelings right now,\" Djokovic said. \"Ten minutes ago I was a point from losing this match and I managed to come back. I was just closing my eyes and hitting my forehand as hard as I can. Rafa is playing fantastic tennis and he is the best in the world. I will do my best to recover and give him my best challenge.\" The Spaniard had a much easier time of it, spending a little over two hours beating the 12th seed Mikhail Youzhny in straight sets. He will be rested, too, and will start favourite to win his ninth slam, putting him seven behind Federer. With all due respect to Djokovic, his deserved win spiked the near-universal hunger for a Nadal-Federer final, a showdown that would have gone a long way to settling the debate about who deserved to be called the greatest of all time. Nadal did not see it like that. \"Sure, it's important,\" he said before the result of Djokovic-Federer had come in. \"But it's just one match. For me it's not more important than the final of Wimbledon 2008 or the final of Wimbledon 2007.\" And maybe there are bigger fights up the road. John McEnroe, for one, thinks Federer can win another major \u2013 but never again be No1. After what was a routine first semi-final, the drama was ratcheted up to unbearable levels in the second, as a packed Arthur Ashe Stadium witnessed the public suffering of a legend and the rising confidence of his adversary, who has lost to Federer here the past three years at this stage. Federer has always made tennis look easy; the bead of sweat staining the back of his blue shirt told another story from the second set onwards. So did the welter of near misses, the 65 unforced errors, the unreliable serve (five double faults in among the 12 aces, as he desperately strove for free points). Djokovic feared him no longer, if he ever did. He could sense the apprehension across the net and, although he himself is no model of consistency, he let his talent flow against the faltering giant. Federer recovered some composure to take the third without convincing either Djokovic or those watching that he was functioning at full force again. There was a rare desperation in his tennis. He resorted more and more to the volley, as he sought to short-circuit the route to the base line, where he still looked uncomfortable. Then, in the fourth set, his horrors returned. The last time Federer lost a set 6-1 here was eight years ago (Nadal belted him 6-0 and 6-1 in Paris in 2008). Serving at 3-1 down in the fourth he looked like heading that way twice in one match, when Djokovic broke him a second time for 4-1. Djokovic held easily, as did Federer, and the pain eased for the five-time champion, but not the task in front of him. The fifth and final set of a match of fluctuating fortunes did not disappoint. With the serving cycle favouring Federer, Djokovic had to save two match points, pulling out three corking winners to frustrate Federer then holding at 5-5. The US Open is the only slam that has a tie-break in the fifth, but nobody wanted this to end \u2013 or, indeed, end this way. They wanted the dogfight to go on and on. The intensity in the fading stages was extraordinary. At just the wrong time, Federer's yips returned and Djokovic had break point; Federer hit a forehand wildly wide for the third time to drop serve and hand the chance for the prize to the third seed. Four points away from the final, Djokovic unearthed the iron in Federer's soul. His forehand now was a liability rather than a weapon and he pushed yet another one off course. Djokovic came to the net and grabbed the point back from Federer, who chose, wrongly, to go cross-court instead of down the line, and it was 30-30. Federer blew a break point, hitting long. Djokovic got to his first match point when Federer netted from deep \u2013 then pushed another forehand out, and the fight was over"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
