Both MPs were left grinning foolishly as Keates delivered a double ritual humiliation in the guise of a vote of thanks. She congratulated Collins, a former Tory communications chief, for \"putting his party where it is today\", and quizzed Pugh, a former teacher, over his union membership. Wrapping up, she offered merrily: \"Both of you have promised us much on many of our key agenda points, but I hope you won't mind if we pursue them with the government as we would like them done sooner rather than later.\" Ouch. \u00b7 Unfortunate timing for Orion children's books, whose 2004 catalogue reached our desk this week with its promise of \"adorable bears and cuddly bunnies\", not to mention the Brilliant Brits series featuring David Beckham. These paperbacks for ages six-plus boast \"quirky pictures, funny captions and clever, concise narrative - these lively and original little books tell children all the things that will most interest them about famous people\". Mummy, why is Posh cross with David? Does he like playing football with that lady? \u00b7 The Becks text scandal seems to have seeped into the unlikeliest places (oh, stop it), with all its deleted words and ****s. What else could explain the headline on a Morning Star splash last week? It had Doug McAvoy, the National Union of Teachers' general secretary, saying: \"We won't put up with blank over funding.\" So what was this missing phrase? Was it something to do with thongs? Or is this an edition of Have I Got News For You? Eventually, we realised, it was \"blank\" as in \"being ignored\". \u00b7 With obese schoolchildren hogging the headlines, NASUWT staff are doing their best to fight off conference flab and keep in trim. South-west regional organiser Roger Darke spent the Llandudno week with a pedometer attached to his waistband measuring his steps as he raced round the conference centre managing media operations. By Thursday, he had clocked up 14.2 miles - well over the 2.5 miles a day minimum recommended by doctors. Every step was genuine, he insisted, though he had swiftly discovered it was possible to cheat by waving the device up and down rapidly \"while sitting in front of the telly\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
