Midfielder David Thompson has agreed a short-term deal until the end of the season after being released from a contract at Blackburn that was due to expire in the summer. And Liverpool striker Neil Mellor has joined on loan for the rest of the campaign, pending the release of his registration from the Reds. Thompson, though, has been plagued with serious injuries in recent times, spending nine months on the sidelines with a knee ligament problem sustained late in 2003. His comeback in August 2004, in a game against Manchester United, lasted a mere 17 minutes as he broke two bones in a foot which led to him spending nearly three more months out. It was an injury which never properly healed, resulting in surgery as soon as last season finished. However, Thompson's woes did not end there as complications with his knee arose while on a pre-season tour to Germany, leading to a visit to see renowned specialist Hans-Muller Wohlfahrt. Although a strengthening programme followed, Thompson has made just eight appearances this season for Rovers, including three starts. Yet manager Paul Jewell is delighted to have his fellow Scouser on board. \"It's a terrific signing for us. David has shown a real hunger to be involved with the Wigan project,\" said Jewell. \"He's a talented lad who can play in a number of positions and he also has an eye for goal. I only believe in bringing players in who add something new to our squad, and in signing David we have done that.\" Mellor's move is a year and a day since his last first-team match for Liverpool, coming on as a late sub in the FA Cup third-round replay defeat at Burnley. Surgery on both knees followed to cure tendinitis, with the 23-year-old finally making his comeback in the reserves early last month. Mellor has scored six goals in 22 appearances for Liverpool, with Wigan assistant-manager Chris Hutchings believing the player is a talent. \"Mellor is a goalscorer, with the knack of being in the right place at the right time,\" said Hutchings. \"With David Connolly injured, Henri Camara away and Lee McCulloch also struggling with a groin problem, we felt it necessary to bring in another striker.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
