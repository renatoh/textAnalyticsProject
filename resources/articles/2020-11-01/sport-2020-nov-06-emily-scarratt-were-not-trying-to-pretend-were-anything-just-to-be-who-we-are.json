Two days after helping England win back-to-back Six Nations grand slams, Emily Scarratt is sitting in her car on a cold night in Loughborough, cursing her lack of foresight in turning down a US college basketball scholarship 14 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely freezing, the rain\u2019s starting to come down and I\u2019ve got to go out and train. I think an indoor sport would definitely have been the way forward.\u201d She doesn\u2019t mean it really. It reinforces, though, just how fortunate rugby is to have her. If you were to conduct a dressing-room poll of the most multi-talented current England players it would probably be Scarratt first, with Maro Itoje and Owen Farrell straining to make the podium. Score the tries, kick the goals, captain the team in your 90th Test and still turn up at your club 48 hours later ready to give more of yourself? If she were male, Scarratt would be being discussed in the hushed tones once reserved for Jonny Wilkinson. Instead, as with most leading sportswomen, the 30-year-old still has to contend with those unable to see beyond their own sad little prejudices. Last month her former England centre partner Rachael Burford cracked and went on Twitter to call out the dismissive, sexist comments on social media after the Six Nations had been sealed. Implicit was that outstanding role models like Scarratt deserve far better. There are societal issues here, clearly, that go way beyond sport. In Scarratt\u2019s case, though, the casual abuse is utterly ridiculous. As anyone who saw her in Sunday\u2019s 54-0 win over Italy will testify, the centre was a richly deserved winner of the player of the tournament award: long-striding, strong, calm, inspirational. How could you fail to respect such a fine athlete and have no interest in watching her and her teammates\u2019 next games against France this month? As a farmer\u2019s daughter from Desford, just outside Leicester, Scarratt is not normally the type to make a public fuss. Even the Red Roses\u2019 record points-scorer, though, is starting to wonder aloud just how much more she and her teammates have to do. \u201cObviously there are still some old and dated views out there which, unfortunately, people still feel they need to share. It comes back to a much bigger issue than women\u2019s rugby. People just need to be kind \u2013 if they don\u2019t agree with something then don\u2019t say it. \u201cI don\u2019t watch certain sports because I know I don\u2019t enjoy them. That\u2019s my choice. If you know you won\u2019t enjoy it, don\u2019t watch it or post about it. If it was me I\u2019d just change channels or move on. I don\u2019t go on social media and air that publicly. That\u2019s the frustration. We\u2019re not trying to pretend we\u2019re anything, we\u2019re just trying to be who we are. Fair play to Burf for speaking out. We\u2019ve got to keep fighting the fight.\u201d There are numerous other challenges as well. Next year\u2019s World Cup is an obvious target but the road to New Zealand is strewn with complications. Not only has Covid-19 caused many of her friends to lose their England sevens contracts but when Scarratt turns out for Loughborough Lightning against Harlequins Women on Saturday in the Allianz Premier XVs it will be under different laws. How many senior men\u2019s players would regard playing under adapted rules \u2013 with barely any scrums and games cut to 70 minutes \u2013 as ideal preparation for a major Test? Few, certainly, would be good enough to switch from 15s to sevens - Scarratt competed at the 2016 Olympics in Rio \u2013 and back without breaking stride. If anything, she looks to be playing as well as ever. \u201cI play rugby because I love it. Everyone says that, don\u2019t they? But for me it\u2019s the truth. I wouldn\u2019t still be able to keep doing if it was starting to feel like a task. That\u2019s certainly not the case at the moment.\u201d It certainly sounded fun after the grand slam was secured at a deserted stadium in Parma. The players were not even allowed to shower afterwards before being whisked back to their hotel but their post-match spirits remained undimmed. \u201cIt was a bit strange but it was also oddly nice. Normally you\u2019ve got lots of friends and family there but in this case no one had anywhere to drift to. We could only celebrate with each other so we put on some cheesy songs that everyone was singing and dancing to. There was a bit of Whitney [Houston], obviously. Hang on, that\u2019s doing her a disservice. She\u2019s not cheesy at all.\u201d Those who argue that England, with the advantage of full-time contracts, could do with stiffer competition are also forgetting the self-imposed pressure that top players like Scarratt place on themselves. \u201cYou go through waves in your career. When you burst on to the scene as a youngster, almost anything you do is good because expectations are really low. Then, all of a sudden, expectation rockets. \u201cPeople expect you to do those things all the time. When you get a bit older and wiser it\u2019s about releasing that pressure from yourself. It\u2019s still there but it\u2019s about doing the things you know you\u2019re capable of. It\u2019s also easy to do your job reasonably well when you\u2019ve got world-class players all around you.\u201d Beneath the modesty, though, remains a layer of steely ambition. Scarratt may be a 2014 World Cup winner and the reigning World Rugby women\u2019s player of the year, having been lauded alongside South Africa\u2019s Pieter Steph du Toit in Japan a year ago, but the qualified teacher is not yet entirely fulfilled. \u201cIf you were to write anything down as a perfect story, winning a World Cup in New Zealand would be pretty much top of the list. It\u2019s a huge year for us \u2026 we\u2019re going to have to be adaptable along the way but we all know the prize we want. It\u2019s not going to be a smooth ride but it\u2019s really exciting.\u201d The only other thing left is for the general public to appreciate fully the quality of Scarratt, Sarah Hunter, Katy Daley-McLean, Sarah Bern, Jess Breach and the rest of this super-impressive England squad. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve played at Twickenham after the men you get an extended crowd who, in many cases, have never seen women\u2019s rugby before. Even if they\u2019re just waiting for the traffic to die down you\u2019ll get people afterwards saying: \u2018I really enjoyed it, it\u2019s better than the men\u2019s.\u2019 It\u2019s a case of continuing to make people aware that if you enjoy rugby then, in theory, you should enjoy women\u2019s rugby. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken such huge strides in the sport. There are so, so many positive stories of girls and women, from five years old to 40 years old, who have taken up rugby. Without wishing to sound too dramatic, it has changed people\u2019s lives. That\u2019s the thing we need to be spreading, not the other stuff that appears on social media. We have an excellent platform at the moment to show what a great sport it is. Hopefully lots of people will get on board with that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
