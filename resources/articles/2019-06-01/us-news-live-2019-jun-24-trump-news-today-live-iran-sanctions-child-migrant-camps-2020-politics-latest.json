Hundreds of migrant children were moved out of a Texas Border Patrol station where they were being held with inadequate food, water and sanitation. Presidential candidate Marianne Williamson had to clarify her stance on vaccines. Carrying on in a longstanding tradition of this administration, the White House sent oversight committee chairman Elijah Cummings a letter today declining \u201cthe invitation to make Ms. Conway available for testimony before the Committee\u201d. President Trump had more to say to the Hill on the sexual assault allegations against him from journalist and advice columnist E Jean Carroll: The article on journalist and advice columnist E Jean Carroll\u2019s sexual assault allegations against President Trump mysteriously disappeared on the New York Post website on Friday afternoon; the wire story by the Associated Press was also scrubbed. Today, CNN is reporting that former editor-in-chief Col Allan - a longtime Trump supporter and \u201cold lieutenant of Rupert Murdoch who returned to the conservative tabloid as an adviser in early 2019\u201d - ordered that the story be removed. Hundreds of children were moved out of a Texas Border Patrol station where they were held with inadequate food, water and sanitation for weeks. At this station, a legal team interviewed 60 children and documented kids forced to take care of kids, no clean clothing, weeks of no baths and poor nutrition. In 2016, President Obama announced the creation of Stonewall National Monument outside the Stonewall Inn in New York, site of the 1969 riot that launched the gay rights movement. It was the first-ever national monument for the LGBT community. Since Obama left office, however, the Trump administration has been fighting to keep the rainbow gay pride flag off of federal lands, according to a cache of internal emails gathered by E&amp;E News. So though Stonewall National Monument remains a national historical landmark recognized by the National Parks Service, the flagpole and rainbow pride flag that still fly outside Stonewall Inn are not technically on federal land. Read the full story here. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi revealed what she told President Trump in asking him to delay the immigration raids: Read here about what the last two years have been like for the children in these communities: Presidential candidate Marianne Williamson had to tweet out a statement on vaccines today after calling mandatory vaccinations \u201ctoo draconian\u201d and \u201ctoo Orwellian\u201d - and then lightly walking that back the next day on the View by expressing a mistrust in \u201cbig pharma\u201d. Former Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs noted Williamson appeared to tweet out and delete another version of the statement that began with \u201cMarianne Williamson\u2019s views on vaccines has been misrepresented in the press\u201d. Hey all, Vivian Ho on the west coast taking over for Lauren Gambino. Happy Monday. Donald Trump slapped a fresh round of sanctions on Iran in response to the downing of a US surveillance drone last week. Tensions remain high even as Trump insists he does not want war with Iran. Bernie Sanders has proposed a new higher education plan that would eliminate virtually all student loan debt. The Treasury Department inspector general will investigate why a decision to put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill was delayed. The US Treasury Department inspector general will investigate the delay in putting abolitionist Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill. The review followed a request by Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who asked the inspector general to look at whether the Trump administration had political motivations for slow-walking the change. Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson, the controversial seventh American president and a political \u201chero\u201d of Trump\u2019s. As president, Jackson supported slavery and implemented the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which forced Native Americans off their land and led to what would later be known as the \u201cTrail of Tears\u201d. Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to increase transparency for the cost of health services. The order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to require hospitals and insurers to disclose negotiated rates for services and to provide patients with an explanation of out-of-pocket costs before receiving their services. \u201cThis is a truly big action,\u201d Trump said of the executive order. \u201cSome people say bigger than health care itself.\u201d He added that the order was \u201cbigger than anything we\u2019ve done in this realm\u201d and that it would \u201cfundamentally\u201d change the healthcare marketplace. The plan is likely to face resistance from insurers and hospitals. With 10 candidates on one debate stage, the evening will be less like a debate and far more like a lightening round of questions and answers. Among the topics we expect the candidates to be asked about are their healthcare plans, how they would combat climate change and why a candidate believes he or she can beat Trump. Here\u2019s what we hope the moderators don\u2019t ask. As more Democrats call for impeachment, congresswoman Frederica Wilson makes the case against it. \u201cAmerica: Allow Democrats to investigate, subpoena &amp; expose all. We can beat him @ the ballot box &amp; when he leaves office, justice will prevail,\u201d she writes. Jason Miller, a former top campaign aide and a close advisor to Donald Trump, has left his job at the consulting firm Teneo just days after calling a top-ranking House Democrats a \u201cfat f**k\u201d on Twitter. The post has since been deleted but it appears the damage was done. \u201cI have parted ways with Teneo by mutual consent and look forward to formally announcing my next move in the coming weeks,\u201d Miller said in a statement to The Daily Beast. \u201cTeneo is an incredible firm and without a doubt the premier CEO consultancy on the planet. They have always been great to me and I\u2019m proud to have called them teammates for the past two and a half years.\u201d What is it they say about life imitating art? The first Democratic presidential debates are right around the corner and the candidates are spending every spare moment prepping. Well, most candidates. The New York Times reported that Bernie Sanders is among the candidates \u201cleast interested in participating in intensive pre-debate drills\u201d. Aides told the Times that Sanders has been reading policy briefings but has \u201clittle patience\u201d for mock debates. But for everyone else, especially those lower-polling Democrats hoping for a breakout moment, it\u2019s all about the pre-debate prep. Kirsten Gillibrand is practicing mock debates with aides standing in for the other candidates. Biden is preparing to be ganged up on by the other candidates. Cory Booker is making sure he\u2019s mentally \u2013 and physically \u2013 fit, adding some pushups between practice sessions. Bill DeBlasio, meanwhile, is seeking advice from his son, Dante. Henry Kerner, the chief of the White House\u2019s Office of Special Counsel, who recommended Conway be removed for what the office said was repeated violations of the a law barring federal employees from politicizing their posts. \u201cHer conduct hurts both federal employees, who may believe that senior officials can act with complete disregard for the Hatch Act, and the American people, who may question the nonpartisan operation of their government,\u201d Kerner will tell a congressional panel, according to his testimony obtained by the The Daily Beast . \u201cMs. Conway\u2019s conduct reflects not a misunderstanding of the law, but rather a disregard for it,\u201d the testimony adds. Interesting figures on the changing racial make up of state legislatures: E Jean Carroll, the celebrated advice columnist who has accused Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in the mid-1990s, has said she is considering bringing a complaint to the New York police department, the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington writes. In a lengthy interview with CNN on Monday, Carroll said she would be open to working with the NYPD in a criminal investigation into the attack she alleges happened in the Manhattan store of Bergdorf Goodman in late 1995 or early 1996. \u201cI would consider it,\u201d she said. However, she added that lawyers had advised her that the statute of limitations deadline by which such a complaint would have had to be brought has expired. Carroll is one of more than a dozen women to accuse Trump of sexual assault and misconduct. A House panel will vote on a subpoena to compel White House counselor Kellyanne Conway to testify about Office of Special Counsel recommendation that she be removed from her posting after repeated violations of the a law barring federal officials from engaging in partisan politics. But that\u2019s not the only effort to hold Conway accountable. Conway has claimed allegations by the independent government agency that she violated the Hatch Act were politically motivated. \u201cYou know what they\u2019re mad about?\u201d Conway said during an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends on Monday. \u201cThey want to put a big roll of masking tape over my mouth because I helped as the campaign manager for the successful part of the campaign.\u201d It\u2019s going to be quite a show, folks. The \u2018fiber arts\u2019 strike back. According to the Associated Press, an \u201c8-million strong social network for knitters, crocheters and others in the fiber arts has banned talk of President Donald Trump and his administration.\u201d \u201cThe new policy on Ravelry.com was posted Sunday. The post says the site took the action because it can\u2019t provide a space \u201cinclusive of all and also allow support for open white supremacy.\u201d The post went on to say that support of the Trump administration is \u201cundeniably support for white supremacy.\u201d It remains unclear what prompted the site to take action. Since Trump\u2019s election, knitting has become a popular pastime among members of the so-called \u201cresistance\u201d. There most visible protest was the pink knit \u201cpussy hats\u201d worn during Women\u2019s Marches around the world. The AP recently reported on the alarming conditions that children are being kept in. At a border patrol station in McAllen, Texas, lawyers who had visited the children and adolescents said they were very sick with high fevers, coughing, and \u201cwearing soiled clothes crusted with mucus and dirt after their long trip north.\u201d Congressman Jim Himes has announced his support for beginning an impeachment inquiry. Until this year, Himes was the head of the New Dems coalition, a group of moderate lawmakers that includes many of the newest members of the majority. These are the members who Democratic leaders fear will be hurt by a political backlash to impeachment. In a series of tweets on Monday, Himes explained his decision: \u201cImpeachment is divisive. The politics of impeachment are messy and uncertain, and might, in the short run, serve the President\u2019s narrow political interests. But look at where we are today. Republicans in this chamber cheer or justify or stand woefully silent in the face of behavior for which they would have impeached a Democratic president many times over. Our best and most proven ideas cannot get even a hearing in the Senate. Unless we restore respect for the law, respect for truth and respect for common decency, we cannot hope to solve any of our other pressing problems.\u201d He concludes: \u201cThere are moments for careful calculation. For weighing political expediency and conflicting interests. And there moments for clarity and conviction. This is that moment.\u201d Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is providing additional details on the sanctions on Iran. The Trump administration has imposed \u201chard hitting\u201d new sanctions on Tehran partly in response to Iran\u2019s downing of an American surveillance drone last week. Trump signed an executive order that he said would continue to squeeze the economy in an effort to bring Tehran to the negotiating table. \u201cThese measures represent a strong and proportionate response to Iran\u2019s increasingly provocative actions,\u201d he said. Last week, Trump approved military strikes after the country shot down an unmanned drone but that he pulled back after determining the attacks was \u201cnot proportionate.\u201d \u201cA lot of restraint has been shown by us,\u201d Trump said before signing the order in the executive office. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to show it in the future but I felt that we want to give [diplomacy] a chance ... I think Iran has a phenomenal future.\u201d Trump added that, being from New York, he has plenty of Iranian friends who he said want to see the country prosper. \u201cWho knows what\u2019s going to happen. I can only tell you that we cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon,\u201d he said. The president also accused Iran of responsibility for explosions last week that damaged oil tankers in the vital Strait of Hormuz. Iran has denied its involvement. Trump turned 73 on June 14th. He has previously said that he and Kim Jong Un \u201cfell in love\u201d and they enjoy sending each other snail mail in the form of \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d letters. White House pool reporter John Fritze of USA Today sends this update: \u201cReporters were ushered into the briefing room at around 11:15 a.m. and the door to the briefing room is now locked. Pool can see a dog sweeping the North Lawn, but not much else is visible.\u201d And then there were ... 25. Yes, 25 Democrats are seeing their party\u2019s nomination as of Sunday when former Pennsylvania congressman Joe Sestak announced his presidential campaign. Have you been sleeping on mass movement to draft Sestak into the race? Is there a great clamoring for yet another member of Congress to join the fray? No and no. Maybe this will help explain. From the Washington Post: \u201cSestak first drew national attention in 2010 when he waged a primary challenge against then-Sen. Arlen Specter, who had switched parties to run for reelection as a Democrat. The Obama White House, in an effort to dissuade Sestak from running, dispatched former president Bill Clinton to offer Sestak an unpaid position on a presidential advisory board if he dropped out of the race. Sestak said no. He bested Specter in the primary and later lost to Republican Pat Toomey in the general election. Sestak pursued another Senate bid against Toomey in 2016, during which he walked alone across the state of Pennsylvania.\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden is also out with a new plan. In an op-ed for the Miami Herald, headlined: Our Latin America policies are morally bankrupt. Mine reflect American values, Biden lays out his vision for immigration reform. The broad strokes of his plan includes: extending citizenship to \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2013 young Americans who came to the US as children, strengthening border security by investing in screening procedures and new technology \u2013 as opposed to a wall \u2013 and easing the migrant crisis by addressing the root causes of poverty, violence and a lack of opportunity throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Last week gave us more evidence that President Trump\u2019s morally bankrupt re-election strategy relies on vilifying immigrants to score political points while implementing policies that ensure asylum seekers and refugees keep arriving at our border,\u201d Biden writes. \u201cTrump threatened the imminent deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants just hours after his State Department confirmed it was cutting off aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras \u2014 the very countries from which most migrants are fleeing. It\u2019s clear Trump is only interested in using his policies to assault the dignity of the Hispanic community and scare voters to turn out on Election Day, while not addressing the real challenges facing our hemisphere.\u201d In 2018, small dollar donations to Democratic candidates and causes skyrocketed thanks in part to a fundraising platform called ActBlue. Republicans today announced their rebuttal: WinRed. According to Politico: \u201cThe new tool is intended to reshape the GOP\u2019s fundraising apparatus by creating a centralized, one-stop shop for online Republican giving, which the party has lacked to this point.\u201d \u2018WinRead\u2019 wasn\u2019t everyone\u2019s favorite name for the new platform. \u201cThe most unexpected stumbling block surrounded the initial decision to dub the new product \u2018Patriot Pass.\u2019 The name was abruptly dropped after New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft told the president that the processor sounded too much like his football team,\u201d Politico reported. There\u2019s a flurry of Supreme Court decisions this morning: Senator Bernie Sanders is out with a new plan that would eliminate the entire $1.6tn of student debt in the United States. The proposal comes days ahead of the first Democratic debate and as Sanders loses ground to his progressive presidential primary rival, senator Elizabeth Warren, who has captured voter attention with her litany of policy proposals. Warren has introduced a plan that would forgive $640 billion in student debt. According to a preview of Sanders\u2019 plan in the Washington Post, Sanders would eliminate student debt held by 45 million Americans as part of a new proposal that would make public universities, community colleges and trade schools tuition-free. How would he pay for it? WaPo\u2019s Jeff Stein says he would pay for these plans with a \u201ctax on Wall Street that his campaign says will raise more than $2 trillion over 10 years, though some tax experts give lower revenue estimates.\u201d Sanders will introduce the package today alongside progressive House members, including congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Pramila Jayapal. Hello and welcome to Monday\u2019s live politics coverage. Donald Trump has been busy tweeting, telling Iran he has two \u201cvery simple\u201d requests: \u201cNo nuclear weapons and no further sponsoring of terror.\u201d In an early-morning flurry, Trump also told other countries to protect their own Gulf oil shipments, and claimed the US has only limited interest in the region. He also declared that the US is now the world\u2019s biggest energy producer. He wrote: \u201cWhy are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries (many years) for zero compensation? All of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been a dangerous journey.\u201d He went on: \u201cThe US request for Iran is very simple \u2013 No Nuclear Weapons and No Further Sponsoring of Terror!\u201d Iran insists it does not have a nuclear weapons program. It signed the nuclear deal in 2015, which limited its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2017. In a later tweet, Trump criticized the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates and claimed it \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
