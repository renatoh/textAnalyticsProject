The 60-year-old rode more than 800 winners in a career that spanned almost 30 years until the age of 45. He was a lightweight rider and rode the winners of many of the major Flat handicaps including the Cesarewitch in 1995 on Old Red and two years later on Turnpole. During the late nineties he struck up a good working relationship with Tim Easterby and among the host of big wins they shared, he rode his sole Group race winner when Jemima was victorious in the Lowther Stakes at York. He rode his final winner, Flanders, in September 1999 as he was forced to quit with circulation problems in his groin. These health issues persisted into his retirement and he had to have the lower half of his right leg amputated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
