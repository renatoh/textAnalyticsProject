I am 27 and have been working as a fundraising assistant for the past two years, which is very administration-heavy. My passion is for marketing communications, but despite having 10 interviews I am yet to find a job in that field. I applied for a more senior role in my current workplace but was told I was \"too good\". They hired somebody with very little experience who I am now training. My salary is equivalent to a much more senior role because my manager is desperate to keep me \u2013 but clearly only as the office junior. Unsurprisingly, I am struggling with the mixed messages I am getting, and feel totally demotivated and stressed. Feedback from interviews suggests other candidates have more experience. I have been volunteering, and am currently doing a professional qualification to boost my chances, but it still doesn't match other candidates. Should I write off the past two years and try to move sideways into the same role I am doing now but with a different focus, which, if I am lucky, will give me the new media-related experience my CV is missing? Or carry on and hope I will eventually get a role? I don't want to still be the office junior at the age of 30. Jeremy says Like you, I am more than a little baffled by your unusual predicament. As I understand it, you are paid quite a lot more than your position would normally warrant; you were turned down for a more senior position in your current workplace on the grounds that you were too good; and instead, they hired someone with very little experience who you are now having to train. In the absence of any other information, the only explanation I can think of for this topsy-turvy situation is the one you advance yourself: your manager is desperate to keep you. That suggests very strongly that his or her reasons are more personal than professional. If that is the case, you've an additional reason to get on or get out. I don't think you need to write off your last two years' experience. In fact, I think you will be able to use them to your advantage. The good news is that you are unusually successful in obtaining interviews. I assume the majority of these have been with marketing communications firms, rather than with other fundraising organisations \u2013 and they may have felt your experience was too limited in new media. But there are agencies and PR companies in the private sector who work for both commercial clients and charities, and I suggest from now on you concentrate most of your efforts on them. It might be that, initially at least, you would still be almost entirely employed in fundraising, but at least you'd be working in a company with a broader spread of clients and interests. So you would not only have the opportunity to learn quite a lot through observation, but also to make a good enough impression to be given the chance to work on marketing accounts as well. The professional qualification you are working towards should be further evidence that you are committed to proving yourself in this field. So, yes: you do need to make a move. But see if you can use your fundraising experience as a half-way stage to the marketing communications job you've set your heart on. Readers say \u2022 If your manager is desperate to keep you, could you negotiate a new role within your existing remit that would give you the additional experience you need? Make sure they understand that the key admin tasks you perform would still be done. Maybe even make a case for employing a school leaver trainee who you could manage? salamandertome \u2022 First, move company. Your employer has a perception of you that isn't going to change. I stayed at a company for eight years and have recently moved. My new employer appreciates my work and is already talking of a promotion after only two months. Second, seek advice on your CV. It seems you have the skills but maybe this area isn't working for you. MarketingHen I'm afraid to ask for a better reference after a messy job exit I have had a long and successful career working with children and young people in care. But I find I am now unable to move on due to a very bland reference from a former employer. My potential employers required more than this, but it was not forthcoming. I left this employment in difficult circumstances, tantamount to constructive dismissal; I resigned my post. But I have a clear Enhanced CRB and a substantial career history. I'm just worried that if my employer does send a more detailed reference it will be wholly negative. Am I stuck? Jeremy says While the circumstances surrounding your departure from your last job remain as unclear as they are in your letter to me, I suspect you are going to continue to find it hard to find a new job. Where there is vagueness, which can seem like evasion, there will always be room for speculation and suspicion. This can be more than enough for a potential employer to look elsewhere \u2013 and particularly, of course, in a field as sensitive as yours. So in future, when applying for jobs, I suggest you face the problem of that \"bland\" reference upfront. Write a clear and complete description of the events that led to you believing you had no choice but to resign. If you made any mistakes, freely concede them; if you learnt any lessons, list them. Don't bad-mouth your previous employer, and do your best to see the problem though their eyes. Be careful not to appear bitter or resentful: freely accept that the unenthusiastic reference they gave you was probably understandable. Then put this single incident into the perspective of your long and successful career, complete with any other appraisals and references. The impression you should seek to make is of a committed professional with an excellent record facing one unfortunate setback with clear-headed intelligence. At least some potential employers should find this an appealing approach; they will know you'll be more than usually grateful for a job offer and more than usually determined to do it exceptionally well. Readers say \u2022 If you can get another professional you have worked with to give you a reference, which will be genuinely decent, then do this. Most people recruiting are human; they know there are some real nasty petty managers out there, and that disputes are not always the fault of the junior party. They also respect honesty. anenome6 \u2022 I always keep copies of my performance reviews. I have a nice stack of them from my current boss, as well as from previous ones. It may not help you in this instance, but do it in the future, and keep in touch with any all good referees you have. snick For Jeremy's and readers' advice on a work issue, send a brief email to dear.jeremy@theguardian.com.
