Jefferies had to grin and bear it as he lost two players to injury during the first period; witnessed an astonishing miss by Ashley Ward that would have put the Bantams in front had it been taken; suffered as Coventry striker Lee Hughes scored two in a game for the first time since his move from West Bromwich Albion. Oh yes, and Coventry's 4-0 victory was also their best of the season. It all added up to a recipe for resignation from the most stoical of managers let alone one already disenchanted with his lot. And it contrasted sharply with the mood in the Bradford camp when they last visited Highfield Road. Then, in what was their last match for Bradford and Coventry in the Premiership, both sides wallowed in an orgy of mutual commiseration following relegation and optimism for the future. The First Division was to represent a pit stop on route to a rapid return to the top flight. But Bradford have won just once in the last five games and City twice in the last eight. But at least last night they produced a more animated contest than the turgid goalless draw in the spring. Hughes served notice of what was to come in the sixth minute following a cross from David Thompson. The striker met it perfectly, heading the ball downwards in textbook fashion, but was denied a goal by Aidan Davison's superb reaction save. The Bradford keeper's one-man act of defiance should have been rewarded at the other end in the 40th minute when Ward was presented with what seemed an unmissable opportunity. Set up following neat work by the on-loan winger Matthew Etherington and Robbie Blake, the striker contrived to shoot wide of an unoccupied goal from just two yards out. It proved a costly miss as within seconds a Youssef Safri pass split the Bradford defence and Hughes slid the ball past the unprotected Davison. Seconds later Thompson added a spectacular second from distance, which again left Davison helpless to intervene. Davison, perhaps through overwork, but more likely injury did not appear for the second half. His replacement, Gary Walsh was just as busy. His first touch came in the 49th minute when he retrieved the ball from his rigging after Hughes had converted the penalty following a foul on Lee Mills by Stephen Caldwell. Walsh made a superb save to deny Hughes his hat-trick and also deny Thompson a second but he was beaten when substitute Julian Joachim scored his first for City from close range to complete the rout. Man of the match : David Thompson (Coventry City)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
