The Spurs chairman Daniel Levy met the England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson for lunch at the Dorchester during November, when they discussed coaching methods and the contenders for the vacant manager's position. It is believed that Mancini was one of the individuals specifically discussed and Eriksson spoke highly of his credentials. Mancini, who was a key player and latterly a coach for Eriksson at Sampdoria and Lazio, has grown increasingly frustrated with Lazio's financial difficulties. His relationship with the senior players Simone Inzaghi and Dejan Stankovic has also deteriorated in recent months. Mancini has frequently expressed his disaffection with the fifth-placed Serie A club in the Italian press. \"We had studied a project together but it never started,\" said Mancini recently, referring to Tottenham. \"I am still with Lazio only for the bond that I have with this club. People keep on talking, but they know nothing. I hope that things will be explained soon because the players deserve some kind of honesty.\" However Mancini is a significant Lazio shareholder and director, and may be reluctant to break his contract in mid-season, although he is certain not to be in charge next season. He will be under pressure to make his intentions clear at a board meeting on January 17. He had an immediate impact at Lazio, taking them into this season's Champions League during his first full term in charge. However they finished bottom of their group and did not secure a Uefa Cup place. The 39-year-old was considered for the manager's position at Internazionale, but the initial success of Alberto Zaccheroni as caretaker-manager has strengthened his claim to be retained. Mancini keeps in close contact with the former Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli, who will have informed his former team-mate about the English game and the opportunity Spurs might present. Mancini also briefly played for Leicester under Peter Taylor in 2001. Levy would be keen to keep David Pleat in his role of director of football and it is that thinking which has contributed to their consideration of Mancini, who has previously worked in what Pleat refers to as a \"continental style\" of management. Such an infrastructure would be less appealing to Spurs' other principal candidates, Martin O'Neill, Graeme Souness and Alan Curbishley, who would insist on being in sole charge. Pleat had said following Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Charlton: \"I understand that I will be in charge until the end of the season, that's what's been indicated to me by the board. But that's not to say that situation won't change.\" Levy has been alarmed at the slump in form following the announcement at a recent AGM that Pleat would remain in charge until the end of the season. At the time Pleat had restored some stability to the league position and, with their leading candidates already in work, the board decided to defer any appointment. However four straight defeats have sent Spurs into the bottom three and Levy, who this week declared that relegation would be a \"financial disaster\" for the club, is keener than ever to attempt to secure Mancini before the summer. Pleat, meanwhile, has been handed the responsibility of identifying transfer targets and will be provided with the budget to try to bring them to White Hart Lane. Levy, in a meeting with the Tottenham Trust on Tuesday, reportedly told the supporters' group that there would be \"major changes to the squad by the end of January\" and that he is certain the incoming manager \"would approve of\" the signings. Spurs yesterday suffered a refusal on the first of those when the Nottingham Forest manager Paul Hart revealed they have rejected a \u00a32.5m bid for the Irish midfielder Andy Reid. \"It's nowhere near the valuation we have of Andy,\" Hart said. \"I don't know whether Tottenham will be back, but I'm not interested because we're not actively trying to encourage bids.\" Spurs suffered another blow when it was confirmed that Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 will play for Mali in the African Nations Cup after this month's pre-tournament camp in Morocco."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
