Johns's comments - he also predicted that Bradford would \"try and bash us up because they rely a lot on raw power and aggression\" - are sure to act as a red rag to the Bulls. But that may be no bad thing so long as young forwards such as Stuart Fielden and Jamie Peacock, who helped to nullify Johns in Great Britain's shock victory over Australia last November, are again able to control their aggression. Bradford's coach Brian Noble has confirmed that Paul Deacon will start at scrum-half with Robbie Paul switching to stand-off, while the former Wigan enigma Lee Gilmour is a surprise inclusion at centre. Oldham have appointed John Harbin, who made such a positive impression with Wakefield Trinity last season, as their new coach. Harbin, chief executive at Dewsbury since leaving Wakefield last autumn, succeeds Mike Ford, who joined Ireland's rugby union set-up last month. Australia's national coach Chris Anderson, who suffered a heart attack during the decisive third Ashes Test at Wigan in November, is to undergo heart surgery on Monday.
