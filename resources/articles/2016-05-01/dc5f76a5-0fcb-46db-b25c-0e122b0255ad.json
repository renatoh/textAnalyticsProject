Barry Chang barely made it into the lobby when Apple\u2019s security team asked him to leave, he said. \u201cThey said \u2018you cannot come in, you\u2019re not invited\u2019. After that I left and have not gone back,\u201d said an exasperated Chang, who\u2019s been mayor since December 2015 and had approached the computing firm when he was serving on the city council three years ago. Many people in Cupertino, a 60,000-person town in the heart of Silicon Valley, are beginning to organize around their overburdened city. They claim the region is struggling with aging infrastructure and booming companies whose effective tax rate is often quite low. Frustrated by traffic and noise, some in Cupertino are trying to put a stop to more development, which they argue brings more congestion on the roads, parking and train system. But Chang says limiting new development would damage the regional economy and that the real solution should be higher taxes on the wealthy and companies such as Apple. In response to Chang\u2019s pro-development efforts, a group called Cupertino Citizens for Sensible Growth is working to recall him for failing \u201cto fulfill his fiduciary duty to Cupertino citizens\u201d. He says he\u2019s \u201cnot afraid\u201d and is running for California\u2019s state assembly. Convincing local politicians to battle Apple is hard, Chang said. He recently proposed that Apple \u2013 which is building a massive new campus its own employees nicknamed the Death Star, or more favorably, The Spaceship \u2013 should give $100m to improve city infrastructure. To move on the proposal, Chang only needed to get a single vote \u2018yes\u2019 among the three other eligible council members. He failed to get that vote. \u201cThis American politics. This so-called democracy,\u201d Chang said, recalling the unanimous \u2018no\u2019 vote. \u201cApple is such a big company here. The council members don\u2019t want to offend them. Apple talks to them, and they won\u2019t vote against Apple. This is the fact.\u201d Apple\u2019s local efforts to avoid paying higher taxes are part of a larger pattern for the $500bn company, which has long been a pioneer in corporate tax avoidance. Apple pays a 2.3% effective tax rate on its $181bn in cash held offshore, according to Citizens for Tax Justice, a not-for-profit research group focusing on tax policy. Through a series of well-documented offshore manipulations with saucy-sounding names such as the Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich, the industry giants shield themselves off from the theoretically 35% federal corporate tax rate. Citizens for Tax Justice estimates that Apple would owe $59.2bn in US taxes if the money weren\u2019t funneled into offshore shell accounts. Criticism over the company\u2019s offshore tax schemes has become more pointed in recent months, both locally in Cupertino and from Apple\u2019s own staff. Steve Wozniak, Apple\u2019s co-founder, said the company should pay a 50% tax: \u201cJobs started Apple Computers for money, that was his big thing and that was extremely important and critical and good. ... [But] we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be figuring out how to go off to the Bahamas and have special accounts like people do to try to hide their money.\u201d Apple denies using the \u2018double Irish\u2019 arrangement. It also says it has no record of the security incident involving Barry Chang. At a recent Cupertino city council meeting, some residents protested about a lack of funding for public projects, Chang said \u2013 even crumpling up meeting agendas and throwing them. \u201cThey ball up the paper and throw it, and they say \u2018You\u2019re making all the wrong decisions\u2019,\u201d Chang said of angry residents. \u201cThey abuse us.\u201d \u201cIn the meantime, Apple is not willing to pay a dime,\u201d Chang said. \u201cThey\u2019re making profit, and they should share the responsibility for our city, but they won\u2019t.\u201d Chang is stuck now between Apple on one side not paying for his infrastructure proposal and the frustrated citizens who see their roads too crowded. \u201cI\u2019m not going to back down,\u201d Chang said. \u201cRaising taxes is not popular, but I\u2019m not afraid. We are the center of technology, and our public transit system is old and embarrassing,\u201d Chang said. \u201cAnd the politicians have no backbone. They get scared.\u201d Matt Gardner, executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said he\u2019s optimistic but admitted trying to get Americans to really demand corporate tax reform feels Sisyphean: \u201cThere\u2019s basically no appetite for reform,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the case of Apple, people are so enamored with their iPhones that they can\u2019t see the company. And year after year these companies are voted most respected, most trusted.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re all just as good at engineering their own tax rates as they are at engineering new technology,\u201d said Ron Eckstein from advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness. It\u2019s doubly upsetting for activists in Silicon Valley, who say that Apple and Google\u2019s tax arrangements conflict with the way they present themselves as companies that are doing good. \u201cThey all have these mission statements with an overarching social component, a kind of give back aspect to their corporate image,\u201d said Stephen Boardman of the United Service Workers West, the union that represents 40,000 service workers across California and has worked to unionize Apple\u2019s security team. \u201cThey aren\u2019t held accountable to it.\u201d Meanwhile, the mayor of Cupertino plans to keep pushing Apple to contribute more to the town. Apple paid $9.2m in tax revenue to Cupertino in 2012to 2013, which was about 18% of the city\u2019s general fund budget, according to an economic impact report. Coincidentally that was also exactly the same amount CEO Tim Cook was paid in 2014. Chang is now working on proposals for a business employer tax that would make companies with more than 100 workers pay $1,000 per employee. Chang argues the employer tax is less regressive than the competing program: a higher sales tax. \u201cYou\u2019re helping create the problems, so you have to help solve the problem,\u201d Chang said, speaking to Apple. \u201cLook at the system we have here: the rich people get more richer and the poor cannot survive. Where\u2019s the fairness? Nowhere.\u201d He said he tried to organize a rally outside Apple. \u201cBut Apple has a pretty good image,\u201d Chang said. \u201cNo one wanted to go.\u201d This article was amended 5 May. An earlier version of this article incorrectly suggested Barry Chang\u2019s complaint \u201cthey abuse us\u201d, which was contained in the headline, was a reference to Apple. Mr Chang has since clarified he was referring to frustrated local residents. Additionally, Mr Chang did not say he was escorted from Apple\u2019s campus, but that he was asked to leave by a security guard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
