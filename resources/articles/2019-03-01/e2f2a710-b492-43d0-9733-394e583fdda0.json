The girls are back in town! The town is Derry (\u201cor Londonderry, depending on your persuasion \u2013 a troubled little corner in the north-west of Ireland\u201d as Erin records with customary flair for the dramatic in her diary) and the girls are the quartet of best friends who live there; our diarist Erin, her offbeat cousin Orla, Clare (permanently anxious and probably gay, even though Erin \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in lesbians\u201d) and Michelle, who is basically a pure id with a perm, all attend the same Catholic girls\u2019 school. So too, for reasons we won\u2019t get into here, does Michelle\u2019s despised cousin James, over from England. A second series about their teenage travails set in the 90s against the backdrop of the Troubles was commissioned as soon as the first episode of Lisa McGee\u2019s hysterically funny and occasionally profoundly moving creation was broadcast last year. As it finally reached our screens, we found the girls caught up in a bridge-building school overnight trip \u2013 arranged by Father Peter, in whom they induced a crisis of faith last series and who has taken a \u2018sabbatical\u2019 with a hairdresser, been dumped and returned to the priesthood since we last saw him \u2013 to mingle with the people who call it Londonderry. Where English teens might cross the Channel to experience other cultures, the Derry girls need only travel to a draughty town hall to meet Protestants. Name badges on, they are told to pair off. \u201cSister Michael!\u201d cries Orla. \u201cI don\u2019t have a Protestant!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to share with James,\u201d Sister Michael tells her. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough Protestants to go round.\u201d Father Peter is keen to get them to concentrate on their similarities. Can any of the students think of anything Catholics and Protestants have in common? \u201cCatholics really buzz off statues and we don\u2019t so much\u201d shouts one not of the convent\u2019s number. The good father points out that this is a difference. They try again, repeatedly. The blackboard for similarities remains stubbornly empty while the differences board covers every facet of life, from \u201cProtestants don\u2019t like Abba\u201d to \u201cProtestants keep toasters in cupboards.\u201d One secret party that night (nerdy Jenny-with-the-trust-fund dobs them in \u2013 \u201cYou will go far in life, Jenny,\u201d Sister Michael tells her informant, \u201cBut you will not be well liked\u201d) and an equally disastrous attempt at abseiling later and both sets of parents are called. The experiment is over. Back to your toaster cupboards and your statues, kids. And spare a thought for Father Peter, who was only doing his best. Desperate. It was more than enough to reassure everyone that the Derry Girls\u2019 magic remains intact. The evocation of the 90s is as lightly done as ever (Elizabeth Hurley is fleetingly referenced \u2013 \u201cShe\u2019s a total ride but she paperclips her frocks together\u201d) and the Troubled setting, even when the division is brought unusually to the fore, never overwhelms but simply throws into relief the ordinariness of the girls\u2019 lives in the middle of extraordinary depths of conflict. Meanwhile, the story unfolding back home about why \u2013 why? Why? \u2013 Michelle\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t want her big bowl \u2013 her big bowl! \u2013 back from Erin\u2019s is one to bind us all. The new series retains all the unmistakeable, genuine flavour of teenage life, and does that rare thing of concentrating on all that was good about being an adolescent girl. Instead of the inner torments, it showcases the overwhelming confidence that somehow co-existed in equal proportion to the angst. The unabashed sexual curiosity (remember Michelle last series reckoning the time was ripe \u201cto lose the rest of my virginity\u201d) alongside the nervousness (\u201cI haven\u2019t put the hours in,\u201d explains Erin to \u2018her\u2019 Protestant boy she is convinced is about to unleash his sophisticated moves on her, \u201cIt\u2019s just not part of our culture, but if you\u2019re okay with that I say we just crack on\u201d). And above all, the sheer volume at which life was lived. No half measures, no doubts (for long), no second-guessing, just a headlong, passionate rush at everything until the day you find yourself exhausted and unwittingly embark on the long, inexorable journey towards the Sister Michael state of mind in which you will end your days. You may not actually take the veil, but life in a nunnery will start to hold attractions you never dreamed of when it was still your gang hanging tight against the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
