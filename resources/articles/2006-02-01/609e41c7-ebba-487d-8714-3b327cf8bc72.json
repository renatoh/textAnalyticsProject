It's a simple ruse whereby Microsoft starts a teaser campaign for some unannounced project, and everybody whose mother met someone who knew a man who once worked in product development tries knowingly to guess what it is.

Oh, heck, here come the NDA* police, gotta go!\" I wonder if it will come with any of these fantastic whoops * An NDA is a Non Disclosure Agreement, which you have to sign before they'll tell you anything.
