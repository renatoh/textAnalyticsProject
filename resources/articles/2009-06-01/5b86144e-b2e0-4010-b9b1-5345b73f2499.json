But when Mac talks, people listen, most noticeably when he settles in behind the microphone to front the BBC's Wimbledon tennis coverage. And if, as has become all too obvious since the Queen's Club final, the topic is Andy Murray then the seven-times former slam champion, three of them at Wimbledon, has plenty to say. Here, though, is a surprise. \"I can't give him any advice. You have just got to live it. When I lost to Bjorn Borg in 1980 I was able to win Wimbledon three of the next four years. The lesson I learned was I thought the guy was going to go away in the fifth [McEnroe having just won one of the great tie-breaks of all time]. I just didn't think he would want it that bad after I won that tie\u2011breaker. He dug in like a great champion and he seemed to want it more than I did. I was a bit amazed by that. That he didn't even give in. \"You have to always give 100% in a slam and sometimes Andy has in the past got a little careless, especially against lower\u2011ranked players. He sort of lets them in. He has to put these guys away earlier because if he doesn't, he runs the risk of it taking it out of him for later on when he really needs it.\" OK, well it was advice after all, and sound advice, too. McEnroe, still playing on the senior circuit, does not see as much live tennis as he would like, though he keeps himself up to speed with tapes and television. Not that he is always right. Last year he was singing the praises of Novak Djokovic to the high skies, and called it wrong, at least in terms of the young Serb's progress this last 12 months. He also felt Murray was not as fit or strong as he should be this time last year. He has changed his mind on that. \"Losing to [Rafael] Nadal in last year's quarter-finals was the ultimate test and it showed Andy what he needed to do, and he has done it. His legs are thicker, his bounce around the back of the court is impressive, and he's intimidating people with his fitness. His movement is amazing when you think how tall he is. The cat\u2011and-mouse style he plays is something I like to see. It's a thinking man's game and he has got in Federer's head right now. Djokovic is someone you would have said was physically stronger but that has shifted. You can see Andy has got more pop on his serve and he continues to befuddle guys mentally.\" As for winning Queen's McEnroe, who took the title four times, twice going on to win Wimbledon the same year, has mixed views. \"I would take something from it, though ultimately I don't think it's real important other than he will have had the matches. That will look better when two weeks later the Wimbledon courts are a little more beat up and slowed down and you would be more confident. I can see it would make you feel good but I can't see that would be the difference in winning the Wimbledon title.\" It is Murray's unorthodoxy that draws him to McEnroe who, like the world No3, always seemed to have time to spare on any shot. \"Andy can adapt pretty quick and his game is unpredictable which is good for grass. It's a bit of a crapshoot for everyone because there's not much tennis played on it, and most play from the baseline. Roger and Rafa are great on it; Djokovic is maybe a bit less comfortable. As for Andy I don't see why he can't be as good on grass as on hard courts.\" McEnroe has also noted the change in Murray's temperament. \"He has gotten in a comfort zone. He doesn't show a whole lot but to me you feel like he's got the people around him that he wants.\" So now it is a question of whether Murray can make that one final step and win a slam. \"I was 22, like him, when I won Wimbledon. It took a while. But look at the guys ahead of him. You are talking about Federer, the greatest player who ever lived. \"Then you have Nadal who is an unbelievably good player. But something is maybe gonna give. The way Roger played on grass, he seemed pretty unbeatable. Now there is that little chink in the armour. And I think Andy would like his chances against Nadal on grass a lot more this year than last. If nothing else, these two have made him a better player, there is no doubt about that.\" So does McEnroe believe Murray can do what no British male player has managed since Fred Perry 73 years ago? \"He has done everything you could ask. Now it is there for him. It is all maybes. You can see how unbelievably tough mentally this game is. Andy has got some of the best hands I have ever seen on the court so he has to take advantage of that. I think he is playing just the way he wants to play. It's more about in your head when it comes down to it. Belief, willpower and executing at the right moment.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
