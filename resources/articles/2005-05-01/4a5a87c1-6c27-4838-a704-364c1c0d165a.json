The trophy was one of four produced to be presented to the competition winners and is the only one to come up for sale. The solid silver trophy, made in 1896 as a replacement for the stolen original, was bought by a telephone bidder after furious activity at Christie's in London. David Convery, head of the sports memorabilia department at Christie's, said the buyer had asked to remain anonymous. The price, which included the buyer's premium, beat the previous record set in 1997 when a copy of the Jules Rimet World Cup sold for \u00a3254,500. The FA Cup was the star lot among hundreds of football memorabilia items up for sale, which included players' shirts from the turn of the century and modern day, as well as programmes and medals. Alan Ball's 1966 World Cup-winning medal and cap went to the same anonymous bidder for world record amounts. The medal made \u00a3164,800, including the buyer's premium, topping Gordon Banks's \u00a3124,750, and the cap stopped at \u00a343,200, surpassing Geoff Hurst's own 1966 World Cup cap, bought for \u00a337,600. Christie's expected the sale to net more than \u00a31m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
