The England head coach Clive Woodward put Simpson-Daniel's exclusion down to form - even though the 21-year-old looked particularly sharp and dangerous in the pre-World Cup romp against Wales in August - and a back injury. When Woodward took off Dan Luger, the player who was preferred to Simpson-Daniel, at half-time in the quarter-final against Wales, it was regarded by some as a tacit admission that it was the one area of selection he had got wrong. \"I did have a back problem at the time,\" said Simpson-Daniel. \"It flared up when we were training for the Wales game in the summer and when we got to Marseille the following week it still was not right. When Clive called to tell me the bad news about the World Cup, he said the main factor was my form which was fair comment. It still hurt, though.\" Simpson-Daniel made his name playing against the Barbarians a couple of seasons ago when he gave Jonah Lomu the run-around. But he had to wait until November last year for his first England cap. As soon as he made the breakthrough, though, he succumbed to a bout of glandular fever. That was the principal reason he ended up failing to make the cut for Australia because he had to play catch-up and pushed himself back too quickly. \"It came on after I played against Australia at Twickenham,\" he said. \"It took everything out of me and it felt that I had several illnesses rolled into one. I lost a lot of weight, I be came very skinny and I felt very low. I knew it was a big year and I was back within a month but I felt it every time I did any exercise. I was knackered but I got through playing matches. \"It took a long time to get back to where I was. It was a drag but I feel very good at the moment, far stronger and certainly more confident. I have put the weight back on and things have gone well for me with Gloucester. Nothing will make up for missing the World Cup but it will not do me any good to dwell on the past.\" Losing out to Luger was the final blow in a frustrating year for Simpson-Daniel. Scarcely had Woodward's words faded away than the England captain Martin Johnson rang him. \"He told me to keep my head up and do well for my club. He pointed out that I had 2007 to aim for and it meant a lot that a man who had so much on his plate could find the time to give someone like me a call. It said everything about the togetherness of the England squad and why we have been so successful. \"It really hit home what I had missed during the final. As the players walked around the stadium parading the trophy I was delighted for them but I knew I could have been there. That is why Saturday is so important for me: I have the chance to play at Twickenham again in an England jersey before a full house. Most of us are putting on the shirts of guys who've just won the World Cup. They've set the highest standards and we must not let them down.\" Simpson-Daniel was first given his chance at Gloucester by Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 who returned to Kingsholm last weekend as Bourgoin's director of rugby and watched his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 run in two tries in a 49-13 victory for the home side. The first was the result of the wing's pace and awareness - he had so much ground to make up on the defence running after a chip to the line that the referee started to point for a drop-out - and the second was a 70-yard interception which saw him burst through two tacklers. \"We saw an international wing today,\" said Saint-Andr\u00e9. \"I would be very surprised if he is not involved in the start of the Six Nations. He is quick, has excellent hands and is so dangerous with the ball. When you think that England can win the World Cup having left someone of Simpson-Daniel's calibre at home, it really makes you think. Without him we would have pushed Gloucester close.\" Simpson-Daniel acknowledges his debt to Saint-Andr\u00e9. \"He gave me my chance at Gloucester and for someone who was one of the leading wings in the world in his time to pay me compliments means a huge amount,\" he said. \"The World Cup has gone and it is all about the future now. I have not spent the last few months sulking but making sure that I am part of the future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
