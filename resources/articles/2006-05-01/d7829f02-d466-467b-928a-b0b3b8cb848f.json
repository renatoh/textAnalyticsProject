It seems that in the eight months since the Ashes ended the Flintoffs have seeped into the most inhospitable corners of the national consciousness. But their position as the country's favourite sporting couple, bar the Beckhams, may have reached its sell-by date. There are still 15 days till Germany take the field against Costa Rica but already the players, their peccadilloes, their partners and their bikinis are omnipotent. Cricketers, what cricketers? It was cricket, you will remember, that was the event of last summer. From Australia's early-season defeat by Bangladesh to the drunken Ashes victory parade in Trafalgar Square via Brett Lee and Edgbaston and Tony Blair's Downing Street reception, it dominated the news. And the Flintoffs, much to their distaste, became the focus for the country's obsession as Freddie was followed to the supermarket and Rachael was fawned over by drooling fans and tabloid hacks. But The Oval in September became Multan in November and in the big bad world of sporting fame, cricket wasn't quite cutting it. The team wintered in Pakistan and India, not known as Hello! hotspots. Andrew Flintoff was the stand-in captain, levelling the series in Mumbai, but where were the hair extensions, the court convictions, the frolicking-in-the-sea pictures, the shopping excursions? Where were the boss with the loose zipper, the fake sheikh, the player strikes, the drug convictions? These cricketers just couldn't get a handle on this fame thing at all - though Kevin Pietersen, to be fair, was trying his best. And so, people started to forget. When the season began in the April drizzle, how many of cricket's new fans leafed through the paper to follow Graeme Welch leading a resurgent Derbyshire from the graveyard to the top of Division Two and check on how Tom Smith was bowling for Lancashire? Ashley Giles's hernia news was trumped by Wayne Rooney's metatarsal; Alastair Cook's youthful face looked positively lined next to Theo Walcott's. And then, from a position of great strength, England managed to draw the first Test of the summer against Sri Lanka, dropping an astonishing number of catches along the way. The crowd for the Monday at Lord's was pitiful. The atmosphere hung like a dusty old curtain, and England's body language slumped with it. Where, the players might have thought as they watched Chaminda Vaas and Nuwan Kulasekara bat and bat and bat, was the euphoria of last season, the thousands turned away from Old Trafford, the roars that shook Melbourne and rang the cash registers? But perhaps the truth is that World Cup or no World Cup, the Ashes is the only cricket contest that tugs the sleeve of the armchair fan. It is the blue riband event, with the same pull that attracts otherwise sporting agnostics to watch hours of Wimbledon, the London Marathon, the Grand National, Olympic gymnastics and Commonwealth weightlifting. Of course there is no live international cricket on television this summer to whet the appetite, unless you have satellite. Sky have done their best with two magazine programmes - Cricket AM on a Saturday and a What the Papers Say-style chat show on a Sunday - as well as their comprehensive live coverage, but those returning home to a terrestrial house will be reduced to the old-fashioned habit of watching Ceefax with a cup of tea. So, perhaps inevitably, talk has turned to this winter's Ashes despite the Sri Lankan series being but a Test old, Pakistan not having packed their suitcases and the Champions Trophy looming large only in Duncan Fletcher's nightmares. Yet it could be a wonderful season. To the fan prepared to wade through the pages of football there will be plenty of stories to follow. Will Monty Panesar ever find his right foot? Can Cook continue his smooth progress? Will Grievous Bodily Harmison rediscover his punch? Can Michael Vaughan recover from injury and retake the captaincy? Will the Flintoffs, guests at the Beckhams pre-World Cup party alongside Rooney, Joan Collins and David Cameron, really be able to slink back into the background? And do they really want to?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
