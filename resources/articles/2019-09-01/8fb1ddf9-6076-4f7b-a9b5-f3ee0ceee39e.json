Marjorie Dunn was the one wearing a yellow T-shirt saying \u201cI\u2019m Lizzie Armitstead\u2019s Grandma \u2013 Now Lizzie Deignan\u201d. The last bit was a recent addition, after her granddaughter married fellow cyclist Philip Deignan in 2016. By Yorkshire logic, it seemed daft to fork out for new one just because Lizzie had changed her surname, so she went down to the print shop in town and asked them to update it. \u201cWe\u2019re not buying another,\u201d said her husband Ray, himself sporting a Team Armitstead polo shirt he\u2019d been given by BP at the 2012 Olympics, where Deignan won a silver medal. In the end a fairytale victory was not to be: Dutch rider Annemiek van Vleuten crossed the finish line in Harrogate more than five minutes before Deignan, who took 31st place. But that wasn\u2019t for want of support from Otley. Most of the family, including 11 of Deignan\u2019s cousins, watched the race on Saturday from the road outside the house where she grew up and where her parents, Carol and John Armitstead, still live. It can be no coincidence that Welcome to Yorkshire \u2013 the tourist board that persuaded the UCI, the world cycling body, to bring the championships to God\u2019s Own County \u2013 had routed the race right by their back garden. How could Deignan resist? Yes, she had only given birth to her first child a year ago, but she would surely not miss the chance to follow up her 2015 title with one on roads she has ridden \u201chundreds, thousands\u201d of times. Grandma was anxious. \u201cIt\u2019s such a dangerous sport, road cycling,\u201d she said, holding Ray\u2019s hand tightly as the race helicopters hovered overhead. She wasn\u2019t expecting a wave from her granddaughter: \u201cShe will be very focused on the race. I\u2019ve not even rung her this week. I knew her mind would be solely on the world championships.\u201d When the peloton swept past on the 93-mile course, Deignan was tucked tightly in the middle of a bunch, just a hint of a smile behind her sunglasses. It was remarkable to think that a just a year ago she was recovering from labour. She took minimal maternity leave, riding her bike until two days before her daughter Orla arrived, and then got back in the saddle six weeks later, fixated on being in contention at the 2019 world championships in her native Yorkshire. Leaving Otley with the cheers of family and friends ringing in her ears, she hit another wall of support on the Norwood Edge climb, where a contingent from the Otley Cycle Club had gathered. Deignan, an honorary member, last joined a run two weeks before Orla\u2019s birth. \u201cIt was the only time we\u2019ve ever been able to keep up with her,\u201d said Justin Dyson.. \u201cI remember at one point she was on my wheel and I was nervous. I was thinking, if I lose concentration it\u2019s just just myself I\u2019m bringing down here.\u201d The 30-year-old may have been the home-crowd darling, but it was the Dutch squad who went in to the race as favourites. They delivered with devastating ease. Van Vleuten, who had a horrific crash during the road race at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was the rider to make an early breakaway with 64 miles to go on the Lofthouse climb. She rode on her own through the sunlit moors and dales of North Yorkshire all the way into Harrogate and across the finish line, followed two minutes later by last year\u2019s world champion, Anna van der Breggen. Deignan accepted her defeat with grace, praising van Vleuten as \u201chead and shoulders above everyone else today\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the way I raced and the physical shape I got myself in to be here today,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody knows the work I have put in to be here apart from me and my husband. I\u2019m more motivated than ever and enjoying myself more than ever, so I am happy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
