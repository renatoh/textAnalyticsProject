Dot is said to be the gruff inspiration for the TV character Aunty Jack. They both would have approved of this newer arrival, a man with an enormous beard who tends a little herb and veggie garden there: the Australian treasure Costa Georgiadis. Every so often, Costa can be spotted weeding or mulching the raised garden beds with a small crew of ABC staff in tow. Research has shown that tending plants can be hugely beneficial for mental health, stress alleviation and encouraging feelings of empowerment \u2013 so the Dot Strong garden is no doubt a welcome reprieve for the beleaguered team at Aunty. Gardening Australia, the show that the relentlessly joyful Costa has helmed since 2012, turns 30 this year, and they\u2019re celebrating with a 90-minute birthday special \u2013 which features the show\u2019s hosts past and present (including Peter Cundall), a look at the typical Aussie backyard, and a deep investigation into the one and only Costa that promises, somewhat ominously, to \u201creveal more than you may want to see\u201d. Ahead of this, Costa has kindly offered to answer a selection of questions from Guardian Australia readers \u2013 whether your garden is a bush, a backyard, a beard (please don\u2019t all ask questions about the beard), or an on-trend inner-city indoor jungle. In an age of bleak news with no easy fixes, it\u2019s nice to know some problems can be easily solved. If you have a gardening question for Costa, please post it in the comments below. \u2022 Gardening Australia\u2019s 30th Birthday Special airs Friday 15 February at 7.30pm on the ABC"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
