The survey by YouGov also suggests that opposition to Brexit has grown among doctors and nurses, with 75% saying they would now vote to remain in the EU, up from 66% who said they voted that way in 2016. About 64% of those polled said they thought the NHS would get worse after Brexit, compared with just 7% who thought it would get better, while 57% said that the overall quality of care provided by the NHS would go down. The findings suggest that the government has failed to convince senior NHS staff that the service will benefit from what Theresa May has called a \u201cBrexit dividend\u201d \u2014 the extra money that she says can be spent on the NHS because the UK will no longer be paying into the EU budget. The pledge that Brexit would free up \u00a3350m a week for the NHS was a centrepiece of the Leave campaign. But according to the poll, 83% of medical professionals now regard this as a deliberate lie, while just 10% think it was an honest attempt to demonstrate how Brexit would benefit the NHS. The respondents were most worried about staff shortages, longer waiting times and funding cuts that could be caused by Brexit. Eighty-eight per cent said that the NHS needs nurses and doctors from overseas to keep operating, while 90% said it would take a long time to train UK nationals to replace them. The poll for the People\u2019s Vote campaign found that 56% of medical professionals believed waiting lists for operations in their local NHS hospital would lengthen, while 54% thought waiting times in A&amp;E would increase. Sixty-five per cent did not think the government would spend more on the NHS after it stops paying into the EU budget. Peter Kellner, who was president of YouGov until 2016, said that it was \u201cstriking\u201d how much doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 attitudes to Brexit have changed. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the \u00a3350m a week extra for the NHS promised by the Leave campaign has backfired on the doctors and nurses who stood to benefit from it. Two in three of them now regard it as a deliberate lie.\u201d YouGov\u2019s findings are based on a survey of 322 doctors and 707 nurses carried out between 2 and 10 October. Separately, a series of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests reveal that most NHS trusts have made no preparations for Brexit, despite worries about its effect on staffing and the availability of drugs. Of the 101 trusts that responded to the FOI request, 75% said they had done nothing to prepare for the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. Just 25 trusts said they had done some planning, while the remaining 381 of those contacted did not respond. As well as a potential shortfall of trained staff, Brexit may force NHS trusts to grapple with a reduced access to medicines and medical equipment, barriers to clinical trials, and a potential influx of elderly Britons who are currently resident in the EU. One trust that has begun preparations, the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole trust, warned in its FOI response that there were 190,000 British pensioners in the EU who could return to the UK to receive care. This would cost the NHS up to \u00a31bn a year, and require an additional 900 hospital beds and 1,600 nurses. The trust said that it may have to reduce the number of clinical trials it conducts and could find it harder to recruit participants. The UK does not have enough patients or funding to conduct trials of treatments for rare conditions \u2013 such as some types of cancer \u2013 on its own, but it is not clear whether collaborations with European countries could continue. The trust also said it had received no guidance about how the UK\u2019s exit from the European atomic energy community might impact radio pharmaceuticals, which are used to diagnose conditions and cannot be stockpiled. The only UK-based supplier of radio pharmaceuticals is relocating its production overseas because of Brexit, it said. The People\u2019s Vote campaign is set to hold its biggest demonstration yet on Saturday 20 October. More than 100,000 people are expected to join the march in London, which will include a section for NHS staff as well as LGBT, women\u2019s and political party columns. Thirty-six coaches are scheduled to bring people from across the country, several of which are being sponsored by celebrities including Delia Smith and Patrick Stewart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
