Although minor alterations have been made to chronology and some scenes created to aid clarity, the film is based wholly on inquiry transcripts and personal accounts. Some news footage has been used.' In this case, a rather laboured and patronising way of saying 'Here is a true story with some made-up bits' was executed in white type on a black background (subtext: 'Here is some public-service telly at its most profoundly self-important.' Which, in turn, immediately made me want to switch off). I do think the kind of viewer likely to tune into BBC1's Derailed, a docudrama about the 1999 Paddington train crash, probably recognises the genre and won't mistake it for, say, an episode of Dick N Dom Inda Bungalow that has somehow mysteriously worm-holed its way into the Tuesday night schedule. Whatever, this was a sober-to-the-point-of-out-boring-the-pub-bore film based on a (with respect to the victims of train crashes) 20th-century subject which, in these scarily fevered times, now seems both parochial and untimely. Odd this, given that Derailed was directed by Kenny Glenaan, who made the excellent Gas Attack a few years back. Relatives of the victims will have felt more than satisfied in seeing Railtrack portrayed as a greedy, cynical, slapdash, negligent bunch of boo-hiss villains (former Railtrack boss Gerald Corbett, a fine central performance by Ian Redford, was, indeed, hissed at by the victims' relatives during the inquiry), but the film still lacked a dramatic heart. I think this was because we got to the crash too quickly, without being given the opportunity to connect with the individuals involved. The reason disaster dramas spend a great deal of time setting up the lives of characters we know will die is, unsurprisingly, so that we care when they do. One of the most recent and brilliantly effective examples of this was the first 20 minutes of last year's Omagh, so it applies to characterisations of real people, too. Unfortunately, Derailed squidged the human interest backstories into a bunch of quick, domestic snapshots. Even the emotional journey of Kerry Hodder, the train driver's wife, whose dead husband, Michael, was used as a scapegoat for that fatal Spad - 'signal passed at danger' - and who discovered she was pregnant just days after the crash, was played out with a restraint bordering on reticence. I am sorry the victims' relatives have not received the kind of justice they deserve, but, thanks to Derailed, I am sorry intellectually (it's just plain wrong, after all), rather than emotionally. Indeed, as the credits rolled, all I could think was what an extraordinarily ugly object (a big, concrete breezeblock, badly engraved) it was that had been erected to the memory of the 31 dead. It was a shoddy and banal memorial, but perhaps unsurprisingly so. None the less, we could do with a few of those docudrama-style trailers at the start of Waking the Dead, which returned for a fifth series last week. 'What follows is entirely made up and designed to confuse. Although minor alterations could have been made to chronology and some scenes created to aid clarity, it's probably best just to relax and accept that this is based wholly on the work of highly imaginative and well-paid creatives. Oh, and no news footage has been used, though there is some stuff that looks a bit like it, as well as CCTV and loads of exhausting flashbacks ...' Now, I love Waking the Dead, but this one, entitled 'Towers of Silence', was even more barkingly complex than usual, while also contriving to move at the pace of a gently expiring mollusc. I've noticed a sort of creeping trend for building thriller plots around the activities of assorted cults, philosophies and religions. There's lots of Islam, obviously, but we've recently had a Spooks focusing on terrorism executed by a fictional, but entirely plausible group of demented ecowarriors and a Messiah in which the murders were inspired by Dante. Waking the Dead, meanwhile, introduced us to Zoroastrian Parsis. According to comparative-religion.com ('the UK's largest website for religious resources'), Zoroastrianism is the world's 'smallest major religion with followers residing mostly in north east India and Iran'. Well! Hats off to Waking the Dead for finding us something fresh to work with, dramatically speaking, even if it did feel like the result of a meeting in which someone said something like: 'We're looking for a religion that's a bit out there, but none of the Big Ones, if you know what I mean.' 'How about kabbalah?' 'Too trendy. And why wave goodbye forever to the possibility, however remote, of making polite small talk with Madonna at the premiere of another unwatchable Guy Ritchie movie. Nah. Next?' 'Scientology?' 'Don't be daft. They might be mad, but they're mad, loaded and litigious. Hang on, I'll just log-on to comparative-religion.com and see what we can find.' As with Messiah's Dante-fest, Waking the Dead had the task of bringing us up to speed on those aspects of Zoroastrianism we may have failed to pick up in RE classes. Which would be all of them. And though fascinating, I can also see that the Zoroastrian way of death, which involves leaving the recently deceased on top of specially built, open-air towers or, in the case of Waking the Dead, the rooftops of Canary Wharf in order to decompose, ideally with the aid of passing vultures, may have hindered the religion's progress in the West. Anyway, as I say, the plot was so complex, encompassing numerous rotting corpses as well as an Evil Plan by a pharmaceutical company to flood the developing world with counterfeit cancer and Aids drugs, that I pretty much gave up on it halfway through part two on the grounds that you can only fully understand the plot of roughly one in three Waking the Deads but that, amazingly, this in no way hinders one's enjoyment of the show. Instead, I distracted myself with the increasingly quirky and intimate (mother-son, old married couple, siblings?) relationship between Trevor Eve's Det Supt Peter Boyd and Sue Johnston's Dr Grace Foley. But mostly I marvelled at the brief, not to mention extremely 'straight', appearance of Little Britain's David Walliams, and his spooky baby teeth, playing, um ... well, to be honest, I've absolutely no idea. Which may have been the idea. I completely understand the seductiveness of buying into a belief system; I used to believe in all sorts of nonsense until I stopped believing in pretty much everything, including happy endings, three-act story structures and serial drama's great, big, silly deus ex machinas whenever a major cast clearance is required. But, as was amply and persuasively demonstrated by BBC2's Underground Britain: Psychic Surgeon, there are apparently no limits to the gullibility of those whose need to believe outweighs absolutely everything else, including the blindingly obvious. At first sight, Australian 'diagnostic medical intuitive' (her description) Robyn Welch reminded me of nothing so much as Kath and Kim's Kath Day-Knight after a blow-the-budget makeover at David Jones. Robyn, a lady d'un uncertain age, sports a very particular sort of new age bling - silver lipstick and frosted highlights offset by the sort of pricy-yet-tasteless pastel leisurewear favoured by blowsy pier-end fortune-tellers. This alone might be enough to put off the average, terminal-illness sufferer from seeking out Robyn's singular form of 'healing', but she's found a way round this by opting to do most of her work down the phone (\u00a3150 for an eight-minute session, with a few freebies thrown in for good PR; you do the math). It's amazing what Robyn can do on the blower, from manipulating skeletons ('Right! Are you ready for the big zaparoo!') to diagnosing the film's director as having a mysterious brain ailment: 'Your head fluid's a bit out. What does it look like? Yucky! You wouldn't want to know! Mulchy, creamy.' 'All codswallop!' declared the second-opinion neurologist, barely suppressing his giggles. Despite all this, it was difficult to say whether Robyn is wilfully and wickedly fraudulent or merely deluded and fraudulent. Either way, if she didn't exist, somebody would have had to make her up, possibly the team behind BBC3's riotously amusing female sketch show, Tittybangbang, which will mutate into a series soon enough and which featured numerous variations on the theme of wilfully deluded womanhood. You know you're on to a comedy hit when people like me start wandering around sharing nascent catchphrases with the bemused and uninitiated. Tittybangbang's haul included: 'Don' watch me Dustbustin'. Dustbustin' is so boring!' (in an Italian accent) and the almost uncannily Robyn Welch-esque: 'It's just a little bit of seepage', about which the less said the better, frankly. Very funny, very horrid, very BBC3."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
