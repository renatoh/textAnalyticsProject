Price \u00a311.99. Age 5-8 yrs Once, Sieta lived with her Ma and Pa in a house where tins of brightly coloured geraniums grew in the sunshine beside their door. But her parents got sick and died, and so Sieta's aunt brought her to Home Now, where she lies in bed under a plastic roof, remembering the past. The sprawling South African township doesn't feel like home at all to the little girl. Then Sieta encounters an orphaned elephant, brought from Kruger National Park so that he, too, can be looked after and, in empathising with him, she finds solace and friendship for herself. She learns to take comfort from the everyday routines of a life among friends, and a final poignant moment of acceptance comes when her aunt plants tubs of vibrant flowers outside her new front door. An afterword gives information about the plight of Aids orphans in Africa, and teachers can choose whether to talk about this as they read, or to let the story's universal messages about loss, grief and new hope stand alone.
