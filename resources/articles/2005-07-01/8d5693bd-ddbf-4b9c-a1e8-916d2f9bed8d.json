Twenty five years. If the crime was bank robbery or a double homicide, no one would blink. But Bernie Ebbers, the man who built WorldCom, was convicted of cooking the books and hoodwinking investors. It can be argued that he was essentially a con man who parted fools from their money - albeit one who operated on a biblical scale. Twenty five years is a shocking sentence for any non-violent act. It is tempting to suggest that the sentencing of those deemed responsible for inflating the Millennium Bubble has itself become a new bubble in the US, with the judiciary there competing among themselves to impose the most terrible retribution on those who made money unfairly during the boom. But there's more to it. Unlike much of Europe, the health of the corporate system genuinely matters to many ordinary Americans. Corporate crime is more palpable in a nation whose modern foundations rest so squarely on the stockholder system. If you threaten it, as Ebbers did, American society will demand they are protected from you. More specifically, Ebbers was in effect found guilty of treating his accusers - and the US judicial system - with contempt. His \"aw shucks\" defence clearly contributed to the length of his sentence. Will it now cause other executives, tempted to break the law in their pursuit of wealth, to think twice? You bet. Raids by the securities and exchange commission and Eliot Spitzer have already changed behaviour - and cost Wall Street a lot of money. But change to date has been a reluctant, foot-dragging affair, accompanied by squeals about excessive regulation and mounting costs. In US boardrooms the prospect now of executives spending the rest of their lives behind bars if they overstep the mark promises to be galvanic. VW's long road Volkswagen, Europe's biggest car-maker, is in deep crisis and not for the first time. Yesterday it laid out plans to overcome its latest trauma by pledging to increase net earnings by \u20ac4bn within three years with a \u20ac10bn plan for cost-savings and performance improvements. But it will require more than budget cuts and better quality cars to repair this company's financial health. VW requires radical surgery. Superficially, the latest crisis has been prompted by the lurid revelations of bribery, corruption, use of call girls, false expenses and self-enrichment at the top of both management and unions. The affair has claimed the job of the personnel director, Peter Hartz (also the architect of the Schr\u00f6der government's failed labour reforms), together with the heads of two senior managers and the chairman of the works council. But, at a more profound level, the real scandal is about the close, over-warm links between company executives and supervisory board members, including worker representatives. These have resulted in numerous examples of turning a blind eye - not only to buying union cooperation with free trips and gifts but to poor investment decisions, false job security and lack of quality. A decade ago VW remained a brave example of the post-war German corporate consensus and social model, where horrendous losses were overcome by moving to a four-day week and saving 30,000 jobs. Today it is a symbol of the failure of that model to adapt to global challenges. It is the epitome of Germany's economic weakness, with a con servative management clinging to past recipes for success and unwilling to embrace change. Wolfgang Bernhard, the former DaimlerChrysler executive brought in to return the core VW brand to profit, said there would be \"no sacred cows\" in the search for savings and indicated in a weekend interview a much tougher approach to the task. But plant closures are ruled out for the time being - and VW is hamstrung by last year's union agreement to freeze pay in return for guaranteeing more than 100,000 German jobs until 2011. If there are doubts about the group's ability to deliver on its financial plans, there are even more serious questions about whether it can do so while Bernd Pischetsrieder, chief executive, and Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the supervisory board, remain in their jobs. Pischetsrieder may deserve more time but Piech, a scion of the Porsche family, has lamentably failed in his basic task of supervising the company and should head for the exit. But the radical surgery required means a long overdue shake-up of VW's shareholder structure, which sees Lower Saxony (acting for the state) retaining 18.2% of the equity and which also forbids any one from holding more than 20% of the voting rights. The \"VW law\" hands a veto on genuine change to the state and leaves other (typically foreign) investors powerless. The EU is taking Germany to court over the veto but that legal process will take months, if not years. Christian Wulff, Lower Saxony's Christian Democrat premier, has indicated a desire for change. The hope is that he will persuade a new CDU government to abolish the VW law before the courts do - and revise the 50-year-old \"co-determination\" laws which put \"workers\" (union bosses) on the board. Change on this scale could signal a genuine new start for VW - and Germany."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
