Surrey travelled to Scarborough, filled with the confidence of their first victory, but undermanned by injury and World Cup commitments. Will Fraine made a maiden first-class hundred as Yorkshire initially rattled along. However a mid-innings collapse of three for four sprayed the chess pieces in the air, and only 46 from Steven Patterson took the score up to 327. Jordan Clark took 5-77, his maiden five-fer for Surrey. At Trent Bridge Nottinghamshire\u2019s hapless late-middle order lost five for 27 against Essex from a promising position of 141 for 3, catalysed when captain Steven Mullaney was caught for a handsome 74. Samit Patel and Stuart Broad then added a vital 43 for the ninth wicket. There were three wickets for Aaron Beard, Peter Siddle and Jamie Porter. Alastair Cook was caught behind off Stuart Broad for 2, but Tom Westley and Nick Browne had reduced the deficit to 141 by the close. A most peculiar innings at Taunton where Somerset\u2019s first five batsmen made 346 at nearly five an over, including a hundred from James Hildreth, and the last five just seven runs as Hampshire\u2019s Kyle Abbott ripped through the tail with the second new ball, finishing with six for 84. Under forget-me-not skies Zak Crawley and and Sean Dickson put on 132, Kent\u2019s largest opening stand at Canterbury since 2006. Dickson finished 146 not out as Warwickshire\u2019s bowling line up of waifs and strays, missing six first-choice bowlers, struggled. Middlesex\u2019s bowlers, including Toby Roland Jones and Steven Finn, pounded in without reward at Derby. Fynn Hudson-Prentice, making his Championship debut for Derby, was caught for 99, captain Billy Godleman danced his way to 102. Wayne Madsen missed his first Championship game for four years with a hamstring tear. A century from Australian Marnus Labuschagne, his fourth of the season, and 97 from David Lloyd put Division Two leaders Glamorgan made everything groovy despite a mid-innings collapse as Worcestershire Brett D\u2019Oliveira took three wickets for one run. Lancashire found batting sludgy at Sedbergh School, holding its first County Championship game. They limped along to 141 for four on a tricky pitch under kohl skies, but a fifth wicket stand of 87 between Rob Jones and Dane Vilas (67 not out) knocked the stuffing out of Durham. At Hove, Ollie Robinson took six for Sussex 63 against Northants \u2013 his season\u2019s tally now 36 at 18.77. Some intriguing games - quite a collapse there by Somerset, but at least it was a more interesting denouement than the one MS Dhoni conjured up. It was the story of the day really - runs galore then dastardly tumbles of wickets. Those Middlesex bowlers will need a rub-down tonight. Thanks for all your messages BTL - Graham will take over tomorrow and will able to give you the real deal from the Scarborough green house, sea fret and all. Have a lovely evening, the sundowners are on me! Runs a-plenty everywhere, but I\u2019d better think about writing up as the desk will be greedy for copy - it looks like going to the wire at Edgbaston. Cook caught behind for two. Off Broad. Essex 10-1. Nottinghamshire all out for 213 which is much better than it could have been in the current circumstances, where one wicket tends to bring a brace or four. Also they can throw the ball to Broad for the first time in three games - which must help spirits. Essex 10-0 in reply. Three wickets each for Beard, Siddle and Porter. And with a push to point and a hunch and a scamper, that\u2019s the hundred for Marnus Labuschagne! Runs, more runs! His fourth Championship century of the season. All the Lancashire batmen getting in, but none yet to pass fifty, with the odd stoppage for bad light. Lancs 183 for four - not a thriller for all those who made the trek to Sedbergh, especially those in the official Lancashire coach who had that unexpected tour of the local farmyards. Northants have quietly made the recovery of the day from 99 for six to 210 for nine. A quirky little fifty from 21 year old Saif Zaib. Samit Patel and Stuart Broad really have had enough of all this Notts-up talk. They thwack it about in an unbroken partnership of 42. Notts 211 for eight. (an aside: Kohli is out) Somerset wizz past 300 with the loss of only three wickets, the baton passed to Tom Banton (52 not out) and George Bartlett. A hundred exactly for Sean Dickson at Canterbury! Kent 247/2 and this looks hard work for the waifs and strays Warwicks have whistled together. It\u2019s all pretty tight at Edgbaston with Kohli 64 not out. He changes from his cap to his helmet as Eoin Morgan pulls out his ace and brings Jofra Archer back on. Follow it here: Chris Woakes breaks Glastonbury. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 212-2 (Dickson 86 not out) v Warwickshire NOT TEA Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 194-8 (Mullaney 74) v Essex Taunton: Somerset 289-3 (Hildreth 105) v Hampshire NOT TEA Scarborough: Yorkshire 241/7 (Fraine 106) v Surrey DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 259-2 (Reece 96, Godleman 102) v Middlesex Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 235-2 (Labuschagne 87 not out) v Worcestershire Sedbergh: Lancashire 136-3 v Durham Hove: Sussex v Northamptonshire 163-7 (Robinson 5-33) Maharaj about to show what he can do with the bat at Scarborough, with David Willey out for 19 to Sam Curran. It turns out actually that he didn\u2019t really fancy batting today... Notts, ahem, 169 for eight. Luke Fletcher lbw for Porter for the fourth score of under ten. It\u2019s all about the numbers innit. Oh dear, Tom Moores out for nought/nowt and Notts have lost four for 24. It\u2019s the inevitability of the collapse which is so hypnotising.... Marnus Labuschagne rattling along at Sophia Gardens, 80 not out, with Glamorgan\u2019s batting in glorious mode. A first wicket partnership of 80, a second wicket partnership of 75, and an unbeaten third wicket partnership of 55 between Labuschagne and Lloyd. George Scott and Nathan Sowter make the breakthroughs for Middlesex, though at least TRJ takes a catch to dismiss Reece for a so-near 96. Billy Godleman in and out so quickly there was barely time to congratulate him on his 102, 70 of those runs in boundaries. Derby 229-2. Ravi Ashwin may not be the answer to Notts\u2019 question. Lbw to Jamie Porter for five. Notts 162 for six. Oooops, Yorkshire 214 for five. Remember that old adage? I\u2019m not sure the Yorkies did. They\u2019ve now lost three for four, including Fraine for 106. Hear ye Yorkies, this\u2019ll bring a sob to thy hard-nosed throats. Jordan Clark grabs a second wicket at Scarborough and suddenly things aren\u2019t quite so cherry-on-a top rosy for the white rose. Kohler-Cadmore bowled for five. Yorkshire 205 for three. Ah, Mr Siddle, we\u2019ve been expecting you. Notts 151 for five now. Joe Clarke gone for 15 and Notts have lost three for 15. These hundreds a-coming. Now James Hildreth! But not for long, caught at mid-wicket for 105. Somerset 196 for 2. There is gorgeous picture of him having a cuddle with Tom Abell, but I can\u2019t show you as I\u2019ve gone over my photo limit. I\u2019ll have what he\u2019s having please. Aaron Beard, eight wickets against Somerset last week, now has 3-43 v Notts - who are 150 for four, with Mullaney out three quarters of the way to his century. A second wicket falls at Scarborough, Ballance for 23 to Clark (no e). And that\u2019s Will Fraine\u2019s maiden century - bravo!!! A second for Aaron Beard, Nash out for 28. Notts 131 for three. A fascinating bit of body slow-mo from the BCCI. Bumrah is amazing - he only conceded 26 from five overs at the death at Edgbaston, where India have to chase 338. Hope Wayne Madsen has got his feet up, the telly on, and something tasty in a glass. After spraining his ankle yesterday, he is missing his first Championship game for four years. God bless you please, Ollie Robinson, Hove holds a place for those who play, this-a way. Etc. Four for 30; Northants 114 for six. Lancashire finding batting kinda sludgy at Sedbergh. Davies joins Jennings back in the pretty pavilion. Even Livingstone has taken 35 balls to make six. And as I write that my scorecards updates, and it\u2019s not good news for Hass. Out for 24, caught Bancroft b Raine. Lancs 81 for three. Sorry about the small radio silence, slight technical difficulties with home tech not being able to cope with providing England v India and wifi at the same time. Things are afoot Zak Crawley out at the Canterbury run-fest, lbw Rhodes for 72. Kent 135 for one. Master and apprentice. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 116-0 (Crawley 62 not out) v Warwickshire Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 97-2 (Mullaney 57 not out) v Essex Taunton: Somerset 98-1 (Hildreth 51 not out) v Hampshire Scarborough: Yorkshire 130-1 (Fraine 60 not out) v Surrey DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 116-0 (Reece 51 not out, Godleman 63 not out) v Middlesex Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 87-1 v Worcestershire Sedbergh: Lancashire 71-1 v Durham Hove: Sussex v Northamptonshire 96-4 And that\u2019s lunch round the grounds. Scores to follow. And that\u2019s Will Fraine\u2019s maiden Championship fifty for Yorkshire. Well played! Lyth out to Clarke (with an e) for 55. Yorkshire 124-1. What a day for batting! Except at Hove, where Northants have limped to 83 for four, Rossington and Rob Keogh now rebuilding with seven minutes till lunch. Hmmm, chin scratch. Anyone like to read the runes? And Mullaney falls safely the other side of the mountain - 54 not out. Early days but the Notts-up card not yet in vision. Notts 88 for two. Fifties a-go-go: Zak Crawley at Canterbury, Adam Lyth at Scarborough, Billy Godleman at Hove, and Steven Mullaney teetering on the edge with 49... Notts lose a second, another wicket for young Beard. Mullaney 47 not out; Notts 76 for two. Thomason joins in at Hove, adding to Robinson\u2019s haul. Northants 66 for three. Look at the sky! Sapphire, forget-me-not, sail sheet perfect. And the Surrey bowlers toiling with no reward against Adam Lyth and Will Fraine. Sam Curran\u2019s first six overs went for 30. A second for Ollie Robinson at Hove. Newton caught by the keeper, Northants 50 for two. Yorkshire 58/0 and Kent 57/0 making speedy starts. And Billy Godleman has already got fifty against Middlesex. Toby Roland-Jones and Steven Finn being pancaked about the place. Not a good season back for TRJ, unfortunately. Also today cricket is uniting to raise money for UNICEF. Details below if you\u2019d like to donate. There\u2019s a Lancashire wicket. And it is Keaton Jennings to go as Chris Rushworth throws off the cares of carrying a county to nip him out for 11. Which brings in Hass. We haven\u2019t had a whither Hass? moment for a while. After his hundred against Middlesex, form has rather trickled away. No? Ollie Robinson looking ominously good at Hove. Good luck Northants. They\u2019re back on at Sedbergh. I think there is a mouse under the piano. Help!!! Blimey, Kent are giving it some welly at Canterbury - 43/0 after eight overs. That\u2019s more than some teams are getting in a World Cup power play. Four glorious, I assume, fours for Zak Crawley. Kyle Abbot makes a breakthrough at Taunton - Azhar Ali lbw for 12. Somerset 25 for one. Tighten your belts - they\u2019re off for bad light at Sedgbergh - a word that gives me utter brain fade. Are all those gs strictly necessary? Anyway, Jennings and Davies have put on 13. Elsewhere two wickets have fallen. At Trent Bridge, where you\u2019ll have guessed who is batting. Notts are 16 for 1, Duckett Portered for eight. And at Hove where Vasconcenos was lbw to Robinson for two. Thank you to Lee Smith for today\u2019s county cock-up! I think we need visuals... It is overcast at Sophia Gardens, and I\u2019ve just spotted the team sheet for Somerset - yes for young Bess but still no space for the old warhorse. Looks like a stiff breeze rustling the shirts at Scarborough. Here are the teams: Here\u2019s a great read from Tim de Lisle on how England can fiddle through to win the World Cup. Follow that crucial match at Edgbaston below, where Roy and Plunkett have replaced Moeen and Vince. The rather sensationally brilliant Rob Smyth and Geoff Lemon are on hand with the stats and all that and more. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent v Warwickshire Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire v Essex Taunton: Somerset v Hampshire Scarborough: Yorkshire v Surrey DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire v Middlesex Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan v Worcestershire Sedbergh: Lancashire v Durham Hove: Sussex v Northamptonshire Here\u2019s the pitch at Sedbergh: Good morning! I hope wherever you are the sun is shining, but not too much, the coffee is on you and have time to kill with a little county cricket - even if you\u2019ve half an ear on England v India. There are eight Championship games today, with everyone except Gloucestershire and Leicestershire on the march. Gloucester play Australia A in a one-day game at Bristol, if you haven\u2019t had your fill of victorious Australians yet. It\u2019s a pretty lip-smacking round and if you\u2019re off to Sedgbergh or Scarborough I\u2019m very jealous. Surrey have travelled up to the Yorkshire coast on the back of their first win of the season but understrength, with ten players unavailable because of either World Cup commitments or injury, including a poorly Rory Burns. Ben Foakes captains in his place. Keshav Maharaj makes his first appearance for the other rose, after playing for Lancashire last year. Duanne Olivier\u2019s hip is better so he and Morne Morkel can battle out for fast bowling points at Scarbados. Tim Bresnan is still out with a calf injury. At Trent Bridge second placed Essex, who beat Somerset last week, will hope to keep up the pressure when they play hopeless Notts, marooned at the bottom of the table. Notts can but hope that a return to their HQ after the World Cup shenanigans will bring better luck. Indian off spinner Ravi Ashwin plays the first of his six Championship games, replacing Australian James Pattinson. Stuart Broad returns. Somerset, who lost for the first time last week, have a tough match against third-placed Hampshire. Dom Bess returns to the squad after his loan period at Headingley. Hampshire have added Ian Holland and Oli Soames to their squad. Invigorated Warwickshire arrive at Canterbury. Liam Norwell is out for the season after tearing his hamstring so James Wainman, a left arm seamer, arrives on a month\u2019s loan from Yorkshire.Bailey Wightman, who played for Cheshire last season, is also in the squad. Darren Stevens, hat-trick hero in the second XI last week, returns for Kent but Wiaan Mulder, Sam Billings and Ivan Thomas are injured. In Division Two, Middlesex are missing Tim Murtagh and Paul Stirling, on duty for Ireland, and James Harris with a broken thumb. The magnificently named Fynn Hudson-Prentice makes his Championship debut for Derby but Tom Lace, on loan from Middlesex ,can\u2019t play. Division Two LEADERS Glamorgan return to Sophia Gardens for the first time in nearly three months. Batsman Roman Walker and Lukas Carey join the squad, Marchant de Lange is rested, and Charlie Hemphrey is missing as his wife is imminently due to give birth.The talented Dillon Pennington is included by Worcestershire for the first time this season; Wayne Parnell is out with a hamstring tear. Lancashire v Durham is one-sided on paper, but let\u2019s see what Durham can do after their second win of the season last week over Sussex. Second-placed Lancashire are without the injured Tom Bailey but leg-spinner Matt Parkinson just might get his first game of the season. Durham are expected to be unchanged. At Hove, Varun Chopra, signed from Essex makes his Sussex debut but Mir Hamza (back) and Danny Briggs (ankle) are both out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
