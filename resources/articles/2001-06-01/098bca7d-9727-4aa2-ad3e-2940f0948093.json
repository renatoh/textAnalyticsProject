Nationwide's highly popular online e-Savings account has slumped by 1.45% - almost double the Bank of England reduction - over the same period. It now pays 5.55% compared with 7% at launch a year ago. This week, Nationwide cut its once chart topping interest level by 0.35% as a reaction to last month's 0.25% base rate.The mutual society blames non-mutual competitors for e-Savings's fall from best buy grace over the past year. \"Due to aggressive cuts by competitors Nationwide has received very significant inflows of savings balances. While we aim to remain competitive we do need to balance the inflows of business prudently,\" it says. \"It is still a good rate especially when you consider our \u00a31 minimum balance and lack of terms and conditions. We don't have the introductory bonus offered by Abbey National which boosts their interest rate\". E-Savings customers are not alone in losing out. Nationwide has slashed 0.3 to 0.35% from its cash Isa and many other accounts. But Nationwide's cuts are dwarfed by the slide in rates at offshore based first-e. A year ago, it was paying 6.81% - now it is down to a very modest 4.34% on the first \u00a35,000 - a rate some onshore non-internet banks can beat. And other internet savings accounts have also been hit. Formerly high-flying egg has scrambled savers with a shattering 0.5% cut on its internet only account to 5.25% although other online accounts have fared better. These include Halifax Web Saver which is unchanged at 5.8% and Norwich &amp; Peterborough's Netmaster Saver, down 0.25% to 5.75%. Abbey National has cut most of its rates by 0.25% although its Instant Saver has only gone down by 0.05% - a full 0.25% reduction would have slashed interest to zero. National Savings has also cut many rates by 0.15 to 0.3%. But it has also raised interest on five year savings certificates and children's bonus bonds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
