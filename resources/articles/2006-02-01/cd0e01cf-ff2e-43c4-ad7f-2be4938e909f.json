Are there any programs you recommend? In any case, how does one destroy a hard drive should there be no other reasonable choice? A Maherali Jack Schofield replies: You can't really delete data from a hard drive. When you delete a file, the operating system just deletes the index reference to the file, so the file can often be recovered using an \"undelete\" program. To destroy the data, you need to overwrite the disk sectors with random data. You need to overwrite the file sectors from seven to 35 times, depending on the importance of the data. There are free programs that will do this: search Google for [hard drive eraser]. I'm recommending Darik Horn's DBAN (Darik's Boot and Nuke). This uses a tiny Linux, so you can boot from a floppy and wipe any size hard disk without using the operating system(s) installed. There is also a Mac version. DBAN is used by the US National Nuclear Security Administration, it's open source, and free from http://dban.sourceforge.net. For more security, remove the hard drive and wipe it with a degaussing machine (http://tinyurl.com/a5lmd). For ultimate security, bathe the disk platters in hydrochloric or sulphuric acid until the magnetic coating is eaten away (http://tinyurl.com/crmll). Wireless speakers My wife has subscribed to Sibelius Music (http://sibeliusmusic.classical.com) and thinks it is wonderful. The difficulty is that her computer is not where she wants the music. We could extend the speaker cables but that would be messy and inconvenient. Graeme O Churchard JS: The simplest option is wireless speakers, or wireless headphones. These come with a wireless transmitter that should plug into the PC sound output via a 3.5in jack. Searching for \"wireless speakers\" (www.buycentral.co.uk/qsh/wireless+speakers.html) finds products such as CGV's wireless speakers (www.cyberselect.co.uk/product/790) and the Rimax Wireless Speakers (www.paramountzone.com/wireless speakersystem.htm). Both are available in several places, so shop around. I have not heard any of these so cannot comment on the sound quality, but perhaps readers can. eMule time My son has downloaded eMule. What exactly does it do? Is it safe and legal? John Le Vay JS: eMule is a popular file-sharing client: see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMule for details. It uses a credit system that forces people to share (upload) files, not just download them. It is legal to use eMule, but it can be used to share copyright music, TV shows and movies, which isn't legal. Uploaders are more likely to be sued than downloaders, and some eMule/eDonkey users have been sued, but millions of people still use it. Need.net? The latest updates for my ATI graphics card come in two versions, and one says that I need Microsoft.net. What is it and do I need it on my XP Home PC? Dave Simpkin JS: Microsoft describes .Net (dot net) as its web services platform: it enables a company to develop an IT infrastructure that works across a network, such as the internet. Applications can be developed very quickly using Visual Studio 2005 or the free Visual Studio Express. Most Windows PCs now ship with .Net installed - it should be visible in the Add or Remove Programs panel, or look for its subdirectory in the Windows folder. However, there is no reason to install it unless you want to run a program that requires it. Few do. jack.schofield@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
