The far-right, anti-migration government of Viktor Orb\u00e1n has sought to increase its control over numerous sectors of society since it came into office in 2010, including putting financial pressure on independent media outlets, harassing and taxing NGOs that work on issues such as migration, and moving to centralise historical research. Most notably, the Central European University, an English-language institution founded by the Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, is being forced to move some of its operations to Vienna after a long battle with the government. The country\u2019s Academy of Sciences appears to be the latest target for increased state control. The academy consists of a society of distinguished scientists and intellectuals, alongside a broad research network of 15 institutes and 150 research groups comprising about 3,000 scientific researchers. The government\u2019s plan would separate these institutes from the main academy, and create a governing board in which government-appointed delegates would have a majority. Parliament, which is dominated by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, is currently debating the bill. It is expected to be passed and come into force by 1 September. Hungarian government officials say it is reasonable for the government to have a say in how state funding is used. \u201cThe academy of sciences is a sovereign institution, but not independent from national interests,\u201d said the foreign minister, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, at a conference in Bratislava last week. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that they should make research in areas and directions which are important from the perspective of the future competitiveness of the country.\u201d Scientists at the academy, however, believe the move is punishment for criticism of the Orb\u00e1n government made by social science researchers. \u201cWe were never afraid to criticise the government if research showed policies that were problematic,\u201d said Emese Szil\u00e1gyi, who coordinates an institute representing researchers at the academy. \u201cThe illiberal government here has reorganised many sectors already and it\u2019s clear that this attack against the academy fits into a chain of events.\u201d She said the vast majority of academy employees were against the plan and said they would use \u201cevery available option\u201d to try to stop it from taking effect. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Palkovics, Hungary\u2019s minister for trade and industry, has previously criticised the academy for straying into politics. \u201cTheir job is to give scientific advice and recommendations,\u201d he said in an interview with a pro-government web portal last year. \u201cIn some cases the academy has moved towards being politically active and this is not their task.\u201d L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz, a mathematician and the president of the academy, said there was a misunderstanding about the role of social sciences among government figures, and said criticism was legitimate if evidence-based research ended up suggesting government policy was flawed. \u201cResearch in sociology, economics, political science, can have criticism concerning certain policies, and I think it\u2019s reasonable for the government to listen to this criticism. That is different from politics where you try to change the government,\u201d he said at a press conference held at the academy\u2019s grand building in central Budapest on Wednesday. Lov\u00e1sz said while social sciences could be the most affected by the plan, natural science could also suffer, and the shakeup would make long-term research projects and \u201cany research beyond government priorities increasingly difficult to follow\u201d. He said trust had been eroded by the aggressive and \u201cimproper\u201d way in which the government had conducted negotiations with the academy. He said the initial decision to reorganise the academy\u2019s finances was communicated by email a year ago, and the academy was given just 54 minutes in which to respond. Antonio Loprieno, the president of the European Federation of Academies of Sciences and Humanities, said it was acceptable for a government to set broad parameters for research spending, but the Hungarian law was clearly aimed at giving the government \u201can inappropriate level of detail\u201d in control over research. Loprieno said the Hungarian government\u2019s moves were unprecedented in an EU country and a worrying sign of what might be tried by governments elsewhere. \u201cSo far we are not seeing it anywhere else, but it could happen in countries that are moving towards populist governments, where there is a disregard for science, and universities and scientific institutes could become targets,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
