The chancellor, who is likely to be removed from the cabinet under a Johnson premiership, will tell business leaders in his Mansion House speech on Thursday that any leadership candidate must have a plan B if renegotiations with the EU fail, or their \u201cjob will be on the line\u201d. He will say the two \u201ccore, unshakeable, beliefs\u201d of the Conservative party are under threat \u2013 meaning belief in prudent management of public finances and in the four nations of the UK. Hammond\u2019s intervention is understood to have been prompted by a shock YouGov poll of Conservative party members, which found 63% of members would be willing to see Scotland leave the UK and 59% would be prepared to lose Northern Ireland in order to secure Brexit. More than 60% were prepared to see \u201csignificant damage to the UK economy\u201d. \u201cI will not concede the very ground we stand on,\u201d Hammond will say. \u201cI will fight, and fight again, to remake the case for pragmatism and, yes, for compromise in our politics \u2013 to ensure an outcome that protects the union and the prosperity of the United Kingdom.\u201d Hammond, who is currently locked in a battle with Theresa May over spending commitments the prime minister wishes to make as part of her legacy, suggested he had been alarmed at candidates splashing the cash in their campaign promises. Johnson\u2019s plan to raise the 40% tax threshold from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000 is said to cost \u00a314.1bn. Michael Gove\u2019s promise to scrap VAT and replace it with a lower sales tax has been estimated at \u00a320bn. Sajid Javid has said he would back slowing the pace of debt reduction to use up to \u00a325bn a year for spending, including on education. \u201cThere is a choice. Either we leave with no deal \u2026 or we preserve our future fiscal space. We cannot do both,\u201d Hammond is expected to say. He will also warn that any candidate planning to use no deal as their plan B will be risking a general election. It will be \u201can immutable truth\u201d that parliament has rejected the current deal, as well as no deal, and that the EU will not countenance renegotiation, he will say. Hammond is to say: \u201cThe question to the candidates is not \u2018what is your plan?\u2019 but \u2018what is your plan B? If your plan A is undeliverable not having a plan B is like not having a plan at all. So, the candidates need to be honest with the public. \u201cWe cannot allow ourselves to be forced to choose between our democracy and our prosperity. If the new prime minister cannot end the deadlock in parliament, then he will have to explore other democratic mechanisms to break the impasse. Because if he fails, his job will be on the line \u2013 and so, too, will the jobs and prosperity of millions of our fellow citizens.\u201d Meanwhile the government has increased its efforts to find a solution to the Irish border question with the establishment of a technical group to advise on alternative arrangements to the backstop to keep the frontier open. It is the first of three working groups the Department for Exiting the EU is establishing and is significant because unlike other border delivery groups it embraces some of the leading critics of those who claim the border issue can be solved with technology, without reference to jobs and harmonious community relations. Among those appointed to the group are Queen\u2019s University sociology reader Katy Hayward, who has recently returned from the US for a six-week study of border arrangements, and Declan Billington, Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association who warned in March that the government\u2019s Brexit tariff policy will wipe out dairy farmers in the region. Others on the group include Tim Mairs, the Police Service of Northern Ireland\u2019s assistant chief constable, who is likely to reflect the impact of no-deal Brexit on smuggling, organised crime and co-operation with the Gardai without data exchange or the Euro arrest warrant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
