Hadid appears wearing a scarf over her head in two different images for the front page of Vogue Arabia. The model, who is half Palestinian, said that the appearance \u201cmeans the world\u201d to her. \u201cI think the beautiful thing about there being international Vogues is that, as a fashion community, we are able to celebrate, and share with the world, different cultures,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. She added: \u201cI hope that this magazine will show another layer of the fashion industry\u2019s desire to continue to accept, celebrate, and incorporate all people &amp; customs and make everyone feel like they have fashion images and moments they can relate to... &amp; learn and grow in doing so.\u201d The magazine\u2019s publisher, Cond\u00e9 Nast International, appointed the Saudi princess Deena Aljuhani Abdulaziz as editor-in-chief of the new title.
