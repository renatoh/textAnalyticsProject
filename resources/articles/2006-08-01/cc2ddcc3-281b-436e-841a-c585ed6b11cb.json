The substance is allegedly nandrolone, the same anabolic steroid that Linford Christie tested positive for in 1999. The 2001 world indoor 200m silver medallist is the 13th athlete associated with Graham to give a positive sample. Others include the Olympic champions Marion Jones and Justin Gatlin. Jones is facing a two-year ban should her B sample confirm a positive test for erythropoietin. Jenkins has flown home from Brussels, where she was due to compete in the Golden League meeting tonight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
