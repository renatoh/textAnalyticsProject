Liverpool fell behind to a goal by Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet in the 21st minute but staged a late rally to win 2-1, preserving their six-point lead at the top of the Premier League. \u201cWe made it more difficult at the start, we started playing football but not exactly like we should have \u2013 too playful, like kids,\u201d said Klopp, doing a little mime of children frolicking. \u201cOur football looked good but I didn\u2019t like it. I didn\u2019t like the body language in the first half. We were not like warriors. We were like players. \u201cBody language is important. Aston Villa was ready for a proper fight, a proper battle, to defend with all they had and find space on the counterattack.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe conceded the goal and now it was getting serious \u2013 sometimes you need to get knocks. In the second half we started immediately and were much more aggressive in the right manner.\u201d From that point on, he said, Liverpool were the only likely winners. \u201cThere was only one team who deserved to win it and that was us but I can imagine how bad Aston Villa feels because with all they did today, they would have deserved something.\u201d Man\u00e9 said this was Liverpool\u2019s toughest match of the season so far. Klopp reserved particular praise for the Senegal international for performing so well in the second half despite being booed by home fans after being booked for simulation in the first period. \u201cWhen you see it back it was for sure not diving,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cThere was contact.\u201d Dean Smith declared himself \u201cvery pleased\u201d with Villa\u2019s general performance but lamented \u201ca lack of concentration, two basic errors\u201d that allowed Liverpool to score. \u201cI said to the players after the game that I\u2019m really proud of their performance,\u201d said the manager, \u201cbut I want them to feel the hurt and take it into the next game because that\u2019s how you improve.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
