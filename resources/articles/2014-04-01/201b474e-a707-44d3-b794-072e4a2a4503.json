Don't copy Department for Education's answers", "bodyText": "Michael Gove, the education secretary, is fond of telling the public that his changes to exams will produce more rigorous and demanding courses of study \u2013 and officials in Gove's own department have illustrated his point perfectly with a couple of schoolboy errors. In a paper published by the Department for Education, announcing the new course content to be studied by pupils taking combined science for GCSE, officials managed to let two howlers slip through in a list of physics equations that pupils in England are to be expected to know. The first was a staple of classical mechanics, dating back to the 18th century, the formula for calculating kinetic energy, the energy that an object has when it is moving. In the DfE's mangled version, kinetic energy equals 0.5 x mass x acceleration squared, rather than the correct formulation: kinetic energy equals 0.5 x mass x velocity squared, or Ek = \u00bd mv\u00b2. Then the DfE authors and proofreaders came unstuck on a matter of kinematics, equations that describe the motion of objects. According to the DfE paper, final velocity squared minus initial velocity squared equals 2 x acceleration x time. Whereas a schoolchild in Shanghai or Seoul would surely know that distance, rather than time, was the correct equation. It's not rocket science. Which is probably a good thing, in the context."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
