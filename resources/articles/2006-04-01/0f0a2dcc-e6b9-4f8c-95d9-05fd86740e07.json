The spirit was wildly popular in France in the 1880s and 90s and figured large in the lives and works of artists and writers. Toulouse Lautrec, van Gogh, Wilde, Baudelaire, Rimbaud and Verlaine were all noted absinthe drinkers until, variously debilitated and unhinged, each died prematurely. It led to physical and moral degradation and psychosis, and was even blamed for the loss of the 1870-71 Franco-Prussian war; it was eventually prohibited in France in 1915. Phil Baker has a marvellously humorous turn of phrase, and his book is hugely enjoyable. Freakonomics Steven D Levitt and Stephen J Dubner Penguin \u00a38.99 'Morality,' says iconoclastic economist Steven D Levitt, 'represents the way that people would like the world to work - whereas economics represents the way it actually does work.' Levitt has propelled behavioural economics into the mainstream, applying economic models to non-monetary subjects to deflate conventional wisdoms. Freakonomics, adapted from articles written with journalist Stephen J Dubner, considers the implications of legalised abortions and finds common ground between sumo wrestlers and Chicago teachers, the Ku Klux Klan and estate agents. The book loses depth in its distillation for a mass audience, but Levitt's approach is inspiring and he and Dubner even succeed in making algorithms an entertaining read. A Woman in Berlin by Anonymous (Virago \u00a37.99) On 20 April, 1945, Hitler celebrated his final birthday, the first Soviet shells hit Berlin and a 34-year-old woman journalist began a diary of the last weeks of the Second World War. The city's lack of electricity, water and food soon seemed insignificant as Russian soldiers began indiscriminately raping women. The author pragmatically endured numerous daily assaults, wondering if her acceptance of the attentions of high-ranking officers in return for food and protection from other soldiers was tantamount to prostitution. The author's fianc\u00e9, back from the front, could not cope with her necessary endurance of violations. The women were emboldened by their hard-won survival and bonded by their experience. The diary is a rare, trenchant document of an ugly product of war. I'm Coming to Take You to Lunch by Simon Napier-Bell (Ebury Press \u00a37.99) When George Michael refused to spend the necessary five years touting Wham! to break into America, manager Simon Napier-Bell thought of a far faster alternative: Wham! would be the first Western pop group to play in communist China. Seventeen visits and numerous crooked Chinese officials later, Napier-Bell succeeded, though by then the gig was a swansong as George Michael prepared to go solo. Wham! themselves are surprisingly rare figures in the tale; Andrew Ridgeley appears genial and laidback, George Michael is stubborn but dignified and canny. Given Napier-Bell's hedonistic life in Eighties London, his diverse circle of acquaintances - including Diana Dors, Graham Chapman, Lindsay Anderson and David Steele - and his pithy, lively writing style, this book could hardly fail to entertain. Sahib: The British Soldier in India by Richard Holmes (Harper Perennial \u00a38.99) In the third volume of his trilogy of military histories, Richard Holmes has tackled the Raj, detailing its military campaigns from Clive to the start of the First World War, and gauging how a comparatively small number of soldiers held much of India for almost two centuries. Their gumption - and determination to secure a share of India's wealth - must have been impressive, given forbidding terrain and scorching summers; but their lot was bleak: most drank heavily and died young. Sahib is an exhaustive and often exhausting volume, but Holmes's comprehensive research and excellent anecdotes ensure that determined readers will reap dividends."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
