The 18th-century Qianlong dynasty porcelain vase, found in a house clearance in a suburban home in nearby Pinner, is believed to have fetched the highest price for any Chinese artwork sold at auction. The sale far surpassed the expectations of the auctioneer, Bainbridge's, and the vase's owners, a brother and sister who had inherited it and arranged the house clearance on the death of their parents. Bainbridge's had estimated the 40cm high piece, which is decorated with a fish motif, would fetch between \u00a3800,000 and \u00a31.2m. Helen Porter of the auction house said: \"[The owners] had no idea what they had. They were hopeful but they didn't dare believe until the hammer went down. When it did, the sister had to go out of the room and have a breath of fresh air.\" The vase was believed to have been acquired by an English family during the 1930s or earlier. Bainbridge's said how the object had reached north-west London would never be known. The auctioneer said the piece was one of the most important Chinese vases to go on sale this century. It is understood it was sold to a private buyer from China. Porter said: \"We took it up for a day's viewing in London and rented a room in the Arts Club on Dover Street where it attracted a lot of interest. \"The sale room was full of Chinese bidders. The bidding started at \u00a3500,000 and it reached the hammer price in half an hour. We were all absolutely shocked and thrilled. It's the sort of sale you wait a whole career for.\" The total price of the vase, including the 20% buyer's premium levied by the auction house and VAT on the commission, was \u00a353,105,000. It was described as \"a piece of exquisite beauty and a supreme example of the skill of the ceramicist and decorator\". The piece has a yellow painted trumpet neck and a double-walled construction, meaning an inner vase can be seen through the perforations of the main body. The auctioneer's website said the vase \"would have resided, no doubt, in the Chinese royal palace and was most certainly fired in the imperial kilns \u2026 It is a masterpiece.\" The next item in the same lot, a piece of furniture, sold for about \u00a32,000. Bainbridge's previous highest sale was \u00a3100,000 for a Ming enamel piece two years ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
