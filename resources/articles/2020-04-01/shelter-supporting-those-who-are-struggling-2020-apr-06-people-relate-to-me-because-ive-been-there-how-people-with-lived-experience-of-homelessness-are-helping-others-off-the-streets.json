Aside from the lack of suitable accommodation \u2013 without which it\u2019s hard to build foundations for the future \u2013 they may have to overcome additional issues, such as mental health problems. This can make employment opportunities more challenging. Gareth Jones, 37, from Blackburn, who experienced homelessness and has battled addiction, puts it succinctly: \u201cYou think no one will ever give you a chance because your past looks like you always mess up.\u201d To address this vicious cycle, an initiative by Shelter is helping homeless people turn their lives around with full-time employment. Getting Real Opportunities of Work (GROW) traineeships are 12- to 18-month paid placements that offer people with lived experience of homelessness and housing problems, as well as ex-offenders, and people with mental health or addiction problems, access to meaningful work, training and personal development opportunities. The scheme was launched in 2014 by Shelter\u2019s Inspiring Change Manchester, a National Lottery Community-funded programme. GROW aims to provide meaningful employment opportunities within a supportive environment that allows people to learn on the job and, importantly, use their own lived experience positively. The programme also ensures that \u201cexperts by experience\u201d help shape and are integral in developing Shelter\u2019s services, new initiatives and policy solutions. Jones is one of seven trainees currently employed by the GROW programme. He suffered three spells of homelessness, including nine months sleeping rough in Amsterdam. A cannabis habit, which started at the age of 15, had escalated into addiction. \u201cI made stupid decisions,\u201d he says. \u201cI blew my wages on hedonistic pursuits and the lack of stability became worse and worse. Living the life I was, building my day around weed, I knew I was never going to get anywhere in life. Ultimately I had to admit it to myself and do something about it.\u201d Jones was eventually persuaded to return to Blackburn to live with his parents. He set about tackling his dependency and attempted to find a stable job. While he was looking for work at a jobcentre, he came across GROW. \u201cI thought I\u2019d like to help others going through the same thing I had, so I typed \u2018homelessness\u2019 into the job finder and among the results it generated was the GROW traineeship.\u201d He was offered an interview and it was clear from the start, he says, this was not the typical box-ticking process or a tokenistic placement. \u201cI\u2019ve had loads of interviews and lots of jobs, all of them manual but they were purely to make enough money to live and buy weed. This instantly looked different and useful.\u201d GROW applicants are carefully selected because a job offer entails a considerable commitment from everyone, particularly staff, as programme coordinator Darren de Vally, explains. \u201cThe process is very important. You\u2019re recruiting people with very complex personal histories so it\u2019s important they feel it\u2019s worthwhile applying in the first place. We make it simple, but we need to identify the right people who would really benefit from the traineeship in order to move forward.\u201d All interviews are conducted by a panel of three, which includes someone with lived experience. Anyone who doesn\u2019t receive an offer is given thorough feedback and encouragement to stay involved with Shelter in some way. Once an offer is made and a job assigned \u2013 for Jones this was a placement with Inspiring Change Manchester\u2019s Engagement team \u2013 a careful structure is put in place to ensure the applicant receives meaningful training and support throughout their employment. They\u2019re assigned a day-to-day line manager and a development officer responsible for wellbeing and development, who is someone with lived experience of their own. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that people are properly supported,\u201d says de Vally. \u201cWe make sure every trainee gets as much support as they require. It can be quite intensive sometimes, but we find the benefits far outweigh the effort, not just for them but for the people they support in turn and the expertise they bring to the organisation.\u201d Jones has now been a GROW trainee for 10 months. His daily workload involves dealing with homeless referrals, helping people off the street into temporary accommodation, setting them up with benefits and addressing other challenges. Sometimes it\u2019s pressured \u2013 our first interview is cancelled because one of his clients is threatened with eviction and Jones has to access legal support and help him to find alternative accommodation as a matter of urgency. \u201cI never would have imagined getting into this line of work before, but I\u2019ve now got the confidence to liaise with other professionals,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand a lot about the law and how it relates to people leaving custody on probation, and the conditionalities of being released under licence. I can help people to access support with medical issues and I\u2019m capable of engaging with them about their drug issues. I can do outreach on the streets and people relate to me because I\u2019ve been there. \u201cIn terms of my own recovery I can hardly go and encourage people to turn their back on substances if I\u2019m still doing it myself, it gives me some discipline to practise what I preach.\u201d The GROW programme\u2019s target is to help people like Jones into full-time employment but the trainees\u2019 experience also benefits Shelter because many trainees move on to further roles, in addition to helping to effect wider systems change. \u201cThe scheme has a huge impact on the individuals who go through it, but beyond that they go on to shape the way we deliver our services and campaigns going forward,\u201d says Lucy Flegg, Shelter\u2019s national involvement manager, of why the programme has begun to take on such importance. \u201cWe believe the best way to deliver our services is if we\u2019re led by people who have firsthand experience of the issues.\u201d The GROW programme is proving a success. To date, 56 people have been enrolled, seven are still with the programme and 44 have moved on to further employment. Others have gone into study or further training. The scheme has expanded to London and Sheffield and places will be offered in Plymouth and Lancashire in the next few months. Shelter is keen to roll out the GROW programme nationally but it requires significant investment. The programme has also been key to generating wider public and political engagement on the issues facing people who are homeless or in precarious accommodation. Notably, a traineeship with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority helped to shape some of the city\u2019s homelessness strategy, and a GROW trainee appeared with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham for a number of public and media engagements, including BBC Breakfast. \u201cIt\u2019s a tested model that has excellent outcomes and the scope for growth within our organisation and the wider homeless sector, especially in areas like housing policy development and research, is huge. However, we need to attract further funding,\u201d says Flegg. Those who go through the programme have no doubt about its value. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve made real progress,\u201d says Jones. \u201cI hope other professions would consider employing people with lived experience in their workforce. You can\u2019t afford to write off all those people out there. For me, the ability to tackle these issues daily is empowering. I get a real sense of mission accomplished when I go home at night now.\u201d Find out more about GROW here"}, "isHosted": false}}}
