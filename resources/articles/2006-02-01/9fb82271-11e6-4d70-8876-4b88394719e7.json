Before the Czech Republic freed itself from communism, this was the only official jazz venue in the city. Run by the state, all musicians were paid equally and the quality of the music was secondary. Although this is no longer the case, the venue itself hasn't changed much over the years. It's formal, expensive and often rather soulless. At U Maleho Glena in Prague's Old Town, on the other hand, you're so close to the stage you can see the beads of sweat on the musicians' brows. It's intimate, dark, smoky and intense - just how a jazz club should be. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays are dedicated to the finest young players on the scene. It's been some time since the 1989 Velvet Revolution, but in the deliciously seedy depths of U Maleho Glena, you can feel the energy of this nation's new freedom. \u00b7 Reduta, N\u00e1rodn\u00ed 20, Prague; U Maleho Glena Karmelitska 23; Prague.

How to survive a snake bite Snake bite? Easy. Seen it in a million movies. You just suck the venom out of the wound, right? Wrong. This doesn't work and may make the problem worse, says Doug Lansky, author of The Rough Guide to Travel Survival. First, take off rings or anything else that might restrict the impending swelling. Then keep the bite site lower than the heart to minimise the spread of venom. Keep the patient still. If you're in a group, the victim should be carried or remain with a carer while the others get help. The treatment is antivenin, and the faster you can get the patient to it, the better. If you're a long way from help, you may have to sweat it out. Your only chance with snakes possessing potent neurotoxins may be to tie a bandage about 5cm above the bite in the direction of the heart to slow down the venom's spread."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
