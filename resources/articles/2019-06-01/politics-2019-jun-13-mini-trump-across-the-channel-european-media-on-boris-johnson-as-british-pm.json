Le Monde, in an excoriating editorial, said Johnson had shown himself to be \u201ca stranger to logic and convictions\u201d in a career rich in \u201cdeceits, blunders and failures\u201d. In the run-up to the 2016 referendum he \u201ctold lies on the side of a bus, promised the UK could have its cake and eat it, and compared the EU to the Third Reich,\u201d it said. As foreign secretary he \u201cmade his country an object of ridicule around the world with his amateurism, flippancy and ignorance\u201d, France\u2019s newspaper of record continued. Rivalling Nigel Farage for populism, Johnson\u2019s \u201cjingoistic rhetoric\u201d promised Britons an unrealistic \u201cglorious global future\u201d. His threat to withhold the \u20ac39bn Brexit divorce settlement would have \u201cincalculable consequences\u201d, damaging the international credibility of a country priding itself on being a champion of the rule of law, Le Monde said. And for the EU a Johnson premiership would mean \u201ca mini-Trump across the Channel, dedicated to its sabotage\u201d. Britain would become \u201ca hostile principality, built on social, fiscal and environmental deregulation.\u201d The Dutch daily newspaper de Volkskrant said Johnson\u2019s appeal was as a \u201cBrexit-believer, a 21st-century buccaneer, a pirate who surfs the oceans in search of wealth, unconstrained by rules or conventions\u201d. But it said there was good reason to think he \u201cbelieves rather more in himself than in Brexit\u201d. It said Johnson\u2019s main strength was that \u201cno scandal seems to stick, be it extramarital affairs, fraudulent statements, offensive utterances or an offer to help an old college friend attack a tabloid journalist.\u201d For the Tories he was \u201cthe joker in the card game that Brexit has become\u201d. Germany\u2019s Handelsblatt said Johnson would be \u201cfatal for Britain\u201d. If he succeeded Theresa May at the end of July, \u201cthe UK and the international partners of the fifth largest economy in the world are likely to encounter chaos\u201d. It said Johnson \u201chas never shied away from making bold promises, few of which he has ever kept\u201d. All the signs were that he would continue in this vein, it added, if only because \u201chis sole chance of becoming prime minister is if he meets the expectations of the Brexit hardliners\u201d. Handelsblatt predicted that in the battle for the Tory leadership, Johnson \u201cwill promise a lot \u2013 and ultimately prove unable to deliver \u2026 It is to be hoped that he will be beaten in the race for the premiership. Unfortunately, given Britain\u2019s current pro-Brexit mood, he may not be.\u201d Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds cautioned that \u201cthe only person capable of defeating Boris Johnson \u2013 and there are precedents \u2013 is Boris Johnson himself\u201d. The paper said Conservative Eurosceptics had plainly decided to \u201cignore the many doubts raised by the unpredictable personality of the former mayor of London\u201d. Johnson\u2019s campaign was \u201cvery calculated, with minimal media appearances and an attempt to convey the seriousness and rigour he has lacked in recent years\u201d, it said, and he appeared \u201cmuch more focused and determined than three years ago\u201d. But he may not be able to dodge his \u201cpast mistakes and gaffes\u201d so easily. In Italy, Corriere della Sera published an interview with the veteran Tory politician Chris Patten, who described the favourite to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister as \u201cTrump\u2019s poodle: a liar who does not pay attention to the detail of reality, tells people what they want to hear and relies on their ignorance\u201d. Patten said Johnson exemplified the \u201ccollapse of rationality, of the relationship between the facts and what we believe\u201d in present-day politics. \u201cWhat he is offering is impossible.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2019.
