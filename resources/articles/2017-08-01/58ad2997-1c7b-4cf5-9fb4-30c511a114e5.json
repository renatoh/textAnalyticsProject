Sales of hot desserts were up \u00a32.6m, according to analysts at Kantar Worldpanel, which found more people buying hot puddings, and doing so more frequently. \u201cAsda\u2019s Baker\u2019s Selection range has witnessed 151% growth, helping to drive strong performance in the sponge pudding and chilled pancake sectors,\u201d Kantar analyst Fridaos Abdulrauf told the Grocer. \u201cThe Aldi Specially Selected range has also performed very well, seeing 67.2% growth, mainly driven by sponge puddings. Waitrose\u2019s addition of Bramley apple crumble two-packs helped boost performance.\u201d Aldi and the Co-op had the strongest performance, with pudding sales growing 22.1% and 19.9% respectively. Many big brands have lost out, according to grocery market analyst IRI. It found Premier Foods\u2019 Ambrosia brand was down \u00a33.4m, Aunt Bessie\u2019s down \u00a32.7m and G\u00fc down \u00a3504,000. Last month the Grocer revealed that G\u00fc had shrunk the weight of its twin-pack deserts, while keeping prices the same \u2013 a move driven by the increased cost of ingredients. One brand name that has enjoyed sweet success is Mary Berry. Sales of her Summer Fruit and Belgian Chocolate Brownie puddings in Tesco, Waitrose and Ocado were worth \u00a31.2m. Jem Hodson, marketing manager at Hain Daniels, which produces the Mary Berry desserts, told the Grocer that cautious shoppers, with less money to spend, are sticking to familiar foods. \u201cWe are seeing less growth in truly new ideas, and more in products that are safe but with a twist, reducing the risk of consumers spending money on something they may not like,\u201d says Hodson. Another steady performer is the Christmas pudding. A growing number of retailers are expected to offer premium revamps of the dessert this Christmas, including a Pedro Xim\u00e9nez sherry and pear pudding at Morrisons and a gluten-free pudding at Lidl."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
