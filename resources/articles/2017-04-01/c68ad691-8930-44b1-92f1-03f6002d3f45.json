I noticed a woman waiting at the door of an ex-council house, like one of the houses I\u2019d lived in as a kid \u2013 cheaply built, side window covered with plywood, overgrown front garden. The door was opened by a young woman with a baby in her arms. The baby laughed joyfully at what I took to be the sight of his nan. The phrase \u201cthe babe leaps up on his mother\u2019s arm\u201d came to my mind. And at that same moment I thought: \u201cThat baby, growing up here, will never read Wordsworth.\u201d That is when I decided to try to get great books out of the university and into the hands of people who need them, by creating The Reader. I wanted a reading revolution. For me, literature isn\u2019t a luxury that you can choose or not, it\u2019s the source of that life-changer, imagination. As a child, literature gave me role models and possible worlds. As an adult, it expands my consciousness, putting my mind inside the experience of others. Which is what we all need. \u201cA tough life needs a tough language,\u201d says Jeanette Winterson. \u201cThat\u2019s what literature offers. It isn\u2019t a hiding place. It is a finding place.\u201d The Reader helps people find the literature that will find them by building shared reading groups. Groups meet weekly, a trained reader leader will have chosen something to read, and will read it aloud. Other group members take a turn with the reading, if they want, or simply listen, as they choose. We have read with thousands of people who would never have thought that literature \u2013 that fancy-pants stuff \u2013 had anything to offer them. But shared reading means you don\u2019t need to be a good reader, literary or even literate, to enjoy the emotional and intellectual stimulation of George Saunders, Shakespeare, Chekhov, Winterson, John Clare or any other greats. It\u2019s for everyone. Nicky, at an addiction centre, found her own experience in John Clare\u2019s poem, I Am!: I am \u2013 yet what I am none cares or knows; My friends forsake me like a memory lost: I am the self-consumer of my woes \u2013 They rise and vanish in oblivious host, Like shadows in love\u2019s frenzied stifled throes And yet I am, and live \u2013 like vapours tossed Into the nothingness of scorn and noise, Into the living sea of waking dreams, Where there is neither sense of life or joys, But the vast shipwreck of my life\u2019s esteems; Even the dearest that I loved the best Are strange \u2013 nay, rather, stranger than the rest. \u201cThe poem hit me right there,\u201d she said (pointing to her heart). \u201cI\u2019m literally vapours and I feel like a shipwreck. The things I used to esteem in my life are no longer there and I\u2019ve been forsaken by a lot of people \u2013 I am a bit of a memory lost really, but no one really cares or wants to know.\u201d We run groups in prisons, work in dementia care, schools and libraries. We\u2019ve been commissioned through NHS mental health budgets, in chronic pain clinics, by public health, through addiction services and in workplaces. Under continued austerity, we need to depend less on public money and more on the thousands of individuals who want to, and can help, make the reading revolution happen. Beginning this month, we are building the foundation for a national movement of shared reading. Over the next three years, we\u2019re going to recruit 500 volunteers across the north west. Lots of these people will be \u201creader leaders\u201d, leading the weekly groups, powered by their passionate commitment to the value of great books. Within five years, we plan to have more than 2,000 shared reading groups, where more than 20,000 people will be reading together. I hope that the babe who leapt up will be among them.
