The panel, which trawled 450,000 documents before publishing its long-awaited report last September, established that the main cause of the disaster was a \"failure in police control\", which was subsequently covered up and blamed on the victims. It found that 164 police statements were significantly amended and that the Liverpool fans \"neither caused nor contributed to\" the deaths of the 96 people in Sheffield on 15 April 1989. The bishop, who took up the bishopric in 1998, announced his retirement in a letter to his diocese on Monday. \"It has been a privilege as bishop to serve the wider community, not least in chairing the Hillsborough independent panel,\" he wrote. \"The diocese has recognised the rightness of me doing this which has given me great strength. \"The way the families and survivors have received the panel's report and the way truth is now opening up the path to justice affirms the worth of the panel's work.\" In an interview with the Guardian last October, Jones said he had been under no illusions as to the scale of the task the panel faced. \"I was aware that MPs, the police, the media, the judiciary, possibly the government of the day, were in the frame,\" he said. \"People might think we in the church are naive; we're not.\" He said he would continue to act as an adviser to the home secretary on Hillsborough as well as keeping up his writing and broadcasting and involvement in other projects. The bishop is reported to have been reluctant to take the Liverpool job because he feared it would interfere too much with his family life and parental responsibilities. He accepted the post only after the then prime minister insisted, earning him the nickname \"Blair's bishop\". Jones, who is an evangelical, has been as outspoken in religious matters as he has political ones. Despite opposing the appointment of the openly gay cleric Dr Jeffrey John to be the suffragan bishop of Reading in 2003, he later changed his mind \u2013 and angered many conservative Anglicans \u2013 by arguing that the Bible may support same-sex relationships and apologising to John and his partner for \"adding to their pain and distress\". The dean of Liverpool, The Very Rev Dr Pete Wilcox, described the bishop as \"an extraordinary servant of the diocese of Liverpool, the city and the region, as well as a significant voice on a national stage, for well over a decade\", adding: \"He has been a wise pastor, a thoughtful and thought-provoking preacher and teacher, a courageous prophet, a champion of justice and a faithful friend.\" A farewell service will be held for the bishop at Liverpool cathedral on 3 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
