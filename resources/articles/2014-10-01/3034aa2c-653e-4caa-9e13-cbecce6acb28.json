After a fortnight during which Francesco Totti, that ageless Roman dux, was given an abundant ovation by Manchester City fans and Frank Lampard was applauded by Chelsea supporters, it was back to business as normal. No one was surprised. Lionel Messi could exhibit a stud-perfect roulette and the reaction of most opposition fans would still resemble that of a 70s working men\u2019s club to alternative comedy: arms locked together, eyes fixed on target, rage seeping from every unconditioned bristle. F\u00e0bregas played over 250 times for Arsenal and his only crime appears to have been spurned by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger in the summer. Yet the change to Chelsea blue was enough for deep emotional cords to be hacked off. What would it have cost Arsenal fans to be more generous? Nothing. In fact they would have been lauded, because applauding the opposition is so rare you remember when it happens: England players after Italia 90; Michael Owen after France 1998; Swansea after getting a 0-0 draw at Anfield in 2011. Ryan Giggs at the Bernab\u00e9u in 2013. And, one of the greatest sporting gestures of all: Liverpool fans in 1989 staying to applaud an Arsenal side that had snatched the title away in the season\u2019s final seconds. As a rule \u2013 which is normal in every sport except football \u2013 I always clap the outrageously brilliant, wherever it comes from. I particularly remember Paul Gascoigne, before fame tragically harpooned him, bewitching Steve Foster and Mal Donaghy to score a marvellous goal for Tottenham at Luton Town in the late 80s. My reaction, like that of many others at Kenilworth Road in a time when away fans were barred from that ground, was to admire such genius. There are those who say such behaviour is heretical and that English football has always been tribal. But it is more complicated than that. Admittedly as far back as 1885, Preston\u2019s 5-0 victory over Aston Villa led some supporters - described by contemporary reports as \u201chowling roughs\u201d \u2013 to pelt both teams with sticks and stones while one Preston player was beaten so severely that he lost consciousness. Meanwhile a letter from the Times of September 1946 also bemoaned the fact that \u201cwith the football season in full swing there will doubtless be heard now and then the low, angry, ominous howl which greets an unpopular decision and makes the official hope for a sufficient escort off the field\u201d. But there has been plenty of smooth within the rough. It is not uncommon to read reports of home fans \u201cmuch applauding\u201d opposition players and suchlike in the archives. And when Stanley Matthews retired in 1965, the Times wrote: \u201cThe British are jealous of their institutions. Matthews has become one and whenever he has been unceremoniously tackled there has come a howl of indignation from friends and foe alike on the terraces. The crowd has said: \u2018You can\u2019t do that to our Stan.\u2019 The attitude to him has always been protective and affectionate.\u201d This sounds like a sentimental dollop of marshmallow \u2013 sweet and fluffy. But according to Jon Henderson, who spoke to Matthews\u2019 contemporaries for a recent biography, the worst he got from opposition crowds was \u201cGet on with it Matthews!\u201d when he dwelt on the ball. So what has changed? We live in an era of \u00a3250,000-a-week salaries so footballers are inevitably more detached than ever, making it more likely crowds will be hostile. But few players own Bentleys, insist on Cristal champagne and burn \u00a350 bank notes for a laugh. Most are ordinary blokes earning extraordinary sums. A few days ago I spoke to Kevin Davies, who struggled to recall the occasions when he had been applauded by opposition fans in two decades in the game with six different clubs. Only one came immediately to mind, when he scored for Southampton at Goodison Park in 1997, replicating a Maracana-era John Barnes by weaving through the Everton defence. Davies remembers that, as a kid, his fellow Sheffield United fans would appreciate good football from the opposition but admits \u201cit\u2019s very rare these days, because everyone\u2019s too consumed with their own team. Perhaps football is too tribal. I love the way rugby games are, with fans mixing and going to see two teams go hard at it competing for 80 minutes.\u201d Could it happen in football? Probably not. But, when people say that one sport is vastly different from others because it is like a religion, or a surrogate for war, or something else, it is only natural to be suspicious. Is the Premier League any less intense than the Ashes, the Six Nations or a world title fight? In such sports the protocol is long established. As a supporter you are partisan but not as one-eyed as Cyclops. In cricket, booing a century rather than applauding it would illicit puzzled looks. Even in boxing, when rivals have knocked lumps from each other, their fans applaud when the referee\u2019s arm is raised. Another thing. Football fans are usually also cricket, rugby, boxing fans \u2013 and fans of many other sports. Is it too much to hope they could apply the best fan practices elsewhere to football? Then again, why stand out on the terraces when it is safer to fit in?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
