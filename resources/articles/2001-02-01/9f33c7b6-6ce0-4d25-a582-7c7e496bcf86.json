A team may be a reflection of their manager, but Birmingham City are a side vastly different from how their manager, Trevor Francis, was as a player. Francis has shrewdly assembled a team who are fairly direct and whereas Sheffield United can sometimes be difficult to take on the eye, Birmingham manage to harness it and make it more acceptable. Both teams play direct football, hitting long balls up to their powerful giants of strikers or playing balls in behind for their pacy wingers to run after. It made for a combative, competitive game that threatened, at times, to get out of hand. 'It was always going to be a difficult fixture two weeks before the cup final,' Francis said. 'One misplaced tackle could cost a player a final and the biggest game in his career. There were also three ex-Birmingham players who were trying to prove a point and at times their desire to win was higher than ours.' With so many players having a connection with both clubs, it was hardly surprising that time and space on the ball were at a premium and consequently there were few clear-cut chances. When the first goal did come, it came from a set piece. A long free-kick appeared to be heading out of play, but Keith Curle headed back across goal into the path of Paul Peschisolido. The former Birmingham player, at Bramall Lane on loan from Fulham, headed against the bar but Australian Shaun Murphy followed up to score from close range. A minute later, Peschisolido almost paid for confusion in the Birmingham defence but saw his shot cleared off the line by Jerry Gill. But United went further ahead just before half-time when a short pass from Peschisolido hit the hand of Nicky Eaden, and the referee awarded a penalty that winger Paul Devlin converted. United should have put the game beyond doubt when Devlin sliced open the visitors' defence into the path of Peter Ndlovu. But the former Birmingham striker saw his first shot blocked by keeper Ian Bennett and then sliced the follow-up wide. It didn't matter as, a minute later, Peschisolido delivered the final header from close range after Michael Brown had crossed from the byline. Birmingham scored a late consolation a minute from time when substitute Jon McCarthy's cross was headed home by Geoff Horsfield. While they do have the Worthington cup final to look forward to, in the chase for play-off positions the defeat is a setback for Birmingham. Victory for the home side, however, keeps their hopes alive. 'We all knew it was the day today,' manager Neil Warnock said. 'If we had not got a result, it would have been impossible to get to the play-offs. This gives us an outside chance. We play more football than we are credited for and overall it was a tremendous performance.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
