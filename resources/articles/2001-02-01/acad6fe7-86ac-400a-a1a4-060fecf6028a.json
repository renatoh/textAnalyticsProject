Loadsamoney perhaps. A judge in New York State has said a woman can sue her former professor for sexual harassment for calling her \"Monica Lewinsky\" . Inbal Hayut sued the State University of New York at New Paltz and Alex Young, a professor of political science, who, she claims, created a \"sexually hostile environment\" by constantly referring to her as \"Monica\". Judge David N Hurd ruled that the professor's words could be considered sexual harassment and is allowing the case to proceed. Professor Young had observed that she wore the same coloured lipstick as Clinton's intern and made remarks such as \"How was your weekend with Bill?\" and \"Shut up, Monica. I'll give you a cigar later\" in front of the entire class. She argues she was forced to drop out because her morale and her grades were affected. The professor admits the remarks but thought they were fun. \"He feels bad that it may have been tasteless or politically incorrect, but he certainly had no intention of making it a sexual thing,\" said Kenneth Kelly, his lawyer. \"It was joking and teasing.\" \u0095The race is on to succeed Sir William Stubbs as head of the London Institute.

Among the runners is his funding wizard, Roger McClure, who followed him from the Further Education Funding Council after missing the top job there. Stories? Gossip?

The report has called for more government support for space exploration, and highlights the country's strong academic presence in space research. According to Lembit \u00d6pik, Lib Dem MP for Montgomeryshire, one urgent need for more support is the threat of cosmic disaster. \"It will happen, we just do not know when,\" he said. \"It could be before I finish speaking - in which case I apologise for the fact that my words will be the last thing that honorable Members hear - or it could be in 50m years. My guess is that it will be somewhere between those two.\" Evidence suggests, he said, that the last fatalities from cosmic impact in the UK took place in 1783 - when16 people were killed by an unusual object from space. Dinosaurs, meanwhile, were wiped out 65m years ago. \"We know that species will be wiped out again in the near future - unless we take action to prevent it.\" Research news Forward march A commission on the future of social sciences has been established by the recently formed Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences. Spacy, man Women are less likely than men to be eligible to apply for research grants provided by the Wellcome Trust and all government research councils -except for the Economic and Social Research Council - according to a long-awaited report. But it said when women did apply for grants they were as successful as male colleagues. Universe Africa cashes in The Association of African Universities, which has more than 170 member institutions from 43 countries, has signalled support for charging tuition fees. The four-yearly meeting in Nairobi heard that institutions like Uganda's Makerere University had been able to raise staff salaries and revamp programmes after introducing fees. Universities on the continent face dire financial problems, aggravated by the spread of Aids, and many believe that free higher education cannot be sustained."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
