Just under a month ago, the Rural Fire Service told Australia Walkabout Wildlife Park, in Calga, 60km north of Sydney, there was a chance it could come under threat from the Gospers Mountain fire. The park\u2019s owner, Tassin Barnard, was concerned there was no way to safely evacuate the animals if the blaze descended. She put a call out on Facebook and reached more than 170,000 people. Containers were brought in to take away the pigs, goats, peacocks, chickens, alpacas and other animals. \u201cAll our farm animals are on the farm and they are having a lovely time \u2013 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to want to come home,\u201d Barnard said. The hundreds of kangaroos, emus, koalas, wombats and dingos remained at the sanctuary because Barnard said she had no way to move them in a way that wouldn\u2019t potentially hurt or stress them. So they were protected by an \u201cark\u201d of water set up on the sanctuary. Nearly three weeks later, the Gospers Mountain fire still rages. On Friday it had engulfed 230,000 hectares and was threatening to merge with the 6,000-hectare Three Mile blaze near Wisemans Ferry. The RFS told Barnard two days ago that in this event, the sanctuary could not be protected. \u201cI felt sick, because I thought I\u2019d made the wrong decision and it was too late,\u201d she said. Another call was put out to the contacts Barnard and her crew had made and an evacuation plan was drawn up to shift the animals to Blackbutt Reserve, two hours north of the farm. A helicopter was first procured to take two wombats to Featherdale Wildlife Park. \u201cThey\u2019re two particularly craggy old wombats that weren\u2019t going to take well to travelling anyway, so the fact that we could give them a 15-minute helicopter ride instead of a two- potentially three-hour car trip was really, really important,\u201d she said. Then two horse floats moved the kangaroos and emus. One provided by a hire company was completely enclosed, and covered in rubber to protect the animals from trying to escape or hurting themselves. \u201cTo move these 40-odd kangaroos and wallabies and five emus, I thought it was two days\u2019 work, and I was also convinced that we were going to have animals injured in the process,\u201d Barnard said. \u201cBut because my team has been practising this for three weeks, they were absolutely phenomenal \u2026 We started at 10am and we finished at 2.30pm. And no serious injuries.\u201d Every animal dependent on the sanctuary is now safe. \u201cI am so proud of my team,\u201d Barnard said. \u201cIt\u2019s just phenomenal the way the community has not just helped, but helped in such an organised and orderly fashion.\u201d The constant threat of fires burning for weeks and months was exhausting, she said. \u201cYou\u2019re running off adrenaline, but that fight-or-flight thing doesn\u2019t equip you for staying in dangerous situations for weeks. You shut down, you don\u2019t drink, you don\u2019t want to eat, you sweat. All these weird things happen. I\u2019ve been running on hugs.\u201d Barnard said the fire wasn\u2019t the scariest part. Closure means the park has no income to pay staff or feed animals. \u201cJust because they\u2019re not here doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have to look after them. It\u2019s just something we are taking on faith that we\u2019ll find a way out at the other end.\u201d A GoFundMe page set up to support the park has so far raised more than $25,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
