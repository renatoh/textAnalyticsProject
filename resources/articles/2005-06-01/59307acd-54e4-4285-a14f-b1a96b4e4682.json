The 81-year-old philosopher, Britain's chief moral referee for the past 30 years, has been savaged by commentators for having 'played a monstrous part in helping to destroy our moral heritage'. These are grim accusations that suggest Warnock has been caught urging the death of the nation's first-born or the gassing of Chelsea pensioners. In fact, she had announced, in an obscure pamphlet, that she has modified some of her views about educating children with emotional or physical difficulties in mainstream schools. Too many of them are being placed in standard classrooms and not in special schools, proclaimed the woman who originally helped shape the practice of integrating the teaching of the handicapped. That may seem fair enough, but for the legendary Daily Mail fulminator Melanie Phillips it was an outrage. Last week she accused Warnock of possessing 'one of the most titanic and dangerous egos of our troubled age'. Sitting in her modest, slightly dishevelled home, a 100-year-old farm workers' house in Wiltshire, Warnock seems anything but egotistical and monstrous, and remains happily unruffled. 'It's a badge for any decent liberal to be attacked by Phillips, I would say.' For a so-called monster, Warnock seems unusually hospitable and candid, sometimes painfully so, frequently using the lessons of her own life to make profound and telling judgments. Consider the issue of euthanasia, a topic that has come to dominate her life following the death - which she described in stark detail - of her husband Geoffrey, a former Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, after fibrosing alveolitis had been diagnosed in 1992. 'The disease attacks your lungs and you become more and more breathless. Geoffrey already had a horror of suffocating and used to have nightmares about being buried alive. He knew he was dying, but just didn't want to die like that.' A medically qualified family friend then offered to administer morphine that would ease his breathing and hasten his death. 'It was a great weight off Geoffrey's mind. One day he tried to get out of bed and dropped dead of a heart attack. It had been an awful three years, but not nearly as awful as he had feared. 'The morphine gradually killed him off. It was a good way to do it, and I am extremely grateful to our friend for helping as he did. However, he could easily have been prosecuted and that would have been terrible.' As a result, Warnock is now helping, with Lord Joffe, to pilot the Assisted Suicides Bill through the House of Lords, with the aim of legalising such actions. 'In fact, the bill was thought up following the case of Diane Pretty,' Warnock added. Pretty suffered from motor neurone disease and was physically incapable of committing suicide herself. But anyone who tried to help her end her life faced being charged with murder. So Pretty asked to be helped to die, but was turned down by UK courts and the European Court of Human Rights. 'Diane Pretty was like Geoffrey. She was petrified of dying of suffocation. She knew what was going to happen to her as paralysis crept up her throat. It was terrible she could not have an assisted suicide and that she died in exactly the way she feared she would.' Hence Warnock's support of the Assisted Suicide Bill. She is opposed to the idea of generally legalising euthanasia, which would raise many vexing issues about those incompetent to judge their own prospects - infants or the brain-damaged, for example - but believes the bill's tight, specific proposals for aiding self-inflicted death for the terminally ill are now long over due. 'What happened to Diane Pretty was inhumane, and it should not happen again.' Then there is the issue of her 'controversial' change of heart about educating children with special needs. This also emanates from family involvement. Warnock's daughter Maria is a teacher who became concerned about autistic children in her school. 'They did not flourish, they were miserable and they tended to be bullied. That is what started me off.' So Warnock wrote a pamphlet - out this month - calling for a reappraisal of the practice. 'Thirty years ago it seemed right that there be no stigma in education and that everyone should get the same start in life, but there are problems in mixing everyone together. I was never happy about the inclusion of children with severe autistic problems in schools, for example, and I certainly don't think it is working today.' Similarly, the business of 'statementing' - the official defining of a child's special needs - is not working, she added. All too often, local authorities use the statementing system as a way of avoiding their obligations, which pits parents against council disability experts. 'We need something better,' she said. This repositioning, by one of the nation's most influential educational experts, is obviously important but scarcely seems deserving of the violent frothings of the popular right-wing press - though it is hardly the first time it has attacked Warnock, former head of Girton College, Cambridge. The new pamphlet was merely an excuse to take another bash at someone whose values the moralistic right detests, an urge that can be traced to Warnock's most famous input into British public life, the report of her committee on in-vitro fertilisation. Published in 1984, it recommended allowing embryo research to be carried out in this country - by shifting the definition of an embryo as an entity created at conception to one that comes into existence 14 days later. Most of the country has now accepted this definition. Those of a deep religious or moralistic persuasion still hate it. Hence the vitriol. For all their fury, the Warnock report is a scientific milestone. Yet it was put together by a person who now admits to being 'horribly ignorant' about science. 'It is terrible. I gave up science in my teens and studied Greek, Latin and music. I am still uneasy with scientific terms. Fortunately, I had good teachers on my committee.' In a technological era, scientific ignorance is too dangerous to endure, added Warnock, who is proposing the establishment of a GCSE on general scientific principles that would be taken by those pursuing non-scientific careers. 'We have got to learn not to be afraid of the language of physics or chemistry.' In general, she is scathing about English education, decrying the new AS level exams for post-GCSE pupils as a disaster, while scorning government ministers' attachment to the A-level as the nation's education 'gold standard'. The nation desperately needs an exam system that provides our children with a far broader education, she added. Despite her octogenarian status, Warnock remains fiercely focused and engaged with the public issues that concern her, while evidence of her family - her key influence in life - fills her house. At her dining-room table, guests sit under the gaze of the portrait of her fierce-looking grandfather, Felix Schuster, a banker who funded her and her siblings' education after Warnock's schoolmaster father died before she was born. Elsewhere, shelves are covered in strange varieties of porcelain and papier-mch\u00e9 zebras. 'Geoffrey was never good at buying presents. I took a fancy to a porcelain zebra once, he bought it and the children produced all sorts of fancy versions over the years.' It is a charming and touching image of an involved and concerned parent - and hardly evidence of an 'egotistical monster'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
