As for those loyal souls who do make it to the end \u2013 the best guess is they will do what the vast majority of US sports fans did last week when it was revealed that the Boston Red Sox, one of most written-about teams in baseball, were involved in not one but two drug scandals. They will shrug and turn the page. It's a free world, as Benjamin Franklin might have said, albeit a bit more elegantly. Still, the news that Manny Ram\u00edrez and David Ortiz, the two pivotal members of the 2004 Red Sox team that won the World Series (an event that provided the narrative backbone for Hollywood's remake of Fever Pitch), tested positive for drugs in 2003, and that two members of the Red Sox security staff were fired last year after being implicated in steroid use, was greeted by the US public with a level of indifference it usually reserves for French political affairs. The security-staff story was a five-minute wonder. Meanwhile, the revelations about Ram\u00edrez and Ortiz merely gave fans in Los Angeles (where Ram\u00edrez now plays) and in Boston an excuse to cheer them even louder. There was element of knee-jerk loyalty about this support but there is an even greater element of fatigue. In recent years baseball has had more doping scandals than Amy Winehouse and her entourage, with the inevitable consequence that no one really cares other than those whose job it is to report on them. It is the same in this country. There was plenty of coverage about the cases at Bath and their corrosive effect on the club's reputation. \"It will take a long, long time to remedy [the damage] and the players go into the new season knowing how important it is to uphold the name of Bath. They have a responsibility and they know that,\" said the club's chief executive, Bob Calleja. Bravo, Bob Calleja, but the chances are he will be pleasantly surprised when the new season starts and it is business as usual for Bath rugby (although hopefully not in the home dressing room). Likewise, last week's news that five members of the Jamaica sprint team all failed drug tests \u2013 another so-called scandal that had the same shelf life as unpasteurised milk in a heat wave. The public doesn't care about athletes taking drugs. If it did Dwain Chambers wouldn't have been greeted like a folk hero on his return to the track. It is difficult to push back against this tide of apathy, so it is hardly surprising that many chose not to. Only the other week one leading newspaper questioned the need for golf's drug-testing regime, pointing out that since its introduction in Europe a year ago not one positive test had been provided \u2013 which is a bit like saying in the absence of crime there is no need for any police. In any case, given that approximately 20,000 rounds of competitive golf have been played on the European tour since and fewer than 150 players have been tested, the most remarkable thing isn't the absence of a single positive test but that anyone would believe an anti-doping regime that targets less than 1% of competitors is anything other than a PR stunt. Yet life experience tells us that arithmetical fact and logic are seldom enough to combat emotion and, emotionally speaking, the public seems to have decided it doesn't care. That is its choice and has to be respected \u2013 the public buys the tickets and the TV subscriptions, after all \u2013 but it would be foolish to give up the fight without one last appeal to emotion, one last question that goes to the heart of this whole business: do we really want a world in which cheats always win? Barmy Army detractors deserve a round booing Giles Clarke, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, has proved himself time and again to have the self-awareness of a tailor's dummy, with the managerial deftness to match, so it comes as no surprise to find him blundering into a debate about the conduct of England fans during the current Ashes series, particularly those fans who booed Ricky Ponting during the Edgbaston Test. Australia's captain and his players have \"earned the respect and courtesy of the crowd\", says Clarke. They certainly have, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have earned the right to have their every move politely applauded by England fans, as if this were 1959 and not 2009. Much as some people would wish that time stood still, it doesn't. The atmosphere at Test grounds has changed, especially in recent years, and that is largely due to the Barmy Army \u2013 the informal group of world-travelling, cricket-loving, beer-swilling supporters who have long been encouraged and fostered by the ECB, which has happily feasted on the subsequent financial windfall. Clarke should understand if you want the fans' money (which is significant) you will have to put up with their worst excesses (which are not). He should also understand that a dose of light booing never did anyone any harm, least of all a flinty Aussie like Ponting. Refs need the FA onside when the action starts One of the most corrosive practices in modern football is the criticism aimed by managers at referees in the days before a match takes place. What purpose does it serve other than to hamper the referees' efforts to do the job to the very best of their ability? The FA announced yesterday that such behaviour will henceforth be a disciplinary offence. \"It will be deemed as improper and dealt with accordingly,\" a spokesman said. One can only hope this is the case, although given the cowardice the FA usually displays when it comes to dealing with post-match criticism of referees, one fears that it won't be. Liverpool barb shows that Ferguson is already scared Not a ball kicked and Sir Alex Ferguson is already off and running in the Liverpool-baiting stakes. Asked who would provide Manchester United's sternest domestic opposition in the coming season, he chose Chelsea. \"Liverpool have just had probably their best season for 20 years, finished up with 86 points and still finished four adrift. It will be hard for them to match that, let alone improve.\" In normal circumstances, one would be inclined to consign that little barb to the \"business as usual\" file and leave it at that but on this occasion it is probably worth pointing out that United could also struggle to match last season's effort. No doubt Ferguson was taking comfort from a summer during which Liverpool have mostly been in the business of selling players rather than buying them, but yesterday's purchase of Roma's Alberto Aquilani, along with the earlier signing of Glen Johnson from Portsmouth, just about restores the equilibrium. As for those who have left the north-west for Spain, the loss of Cristiano Ronaldo will surely have a far greater impact on events in the coming season than that of Xabi Alonso."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
