Darkest day: Winless campaign in 1991. Won't let you forget: Scrummaging England off the park in 1995 during the group match in South Africa. Svengali factor: Marcelo Loffreda missed out on three World Cups as a player through bad luck and questionable selection, but has managed to do what none of his predecessors have: to keep the job through qualifying. How do you beat them? Australia and Ireland will look to keep a lid on them in the forwards and punish any indiscipline. How do they beat you? Much would have depended on centre Lisandro Arbizu, who has been captain since 1992. His injury in a pre-tournament warm-up match has weakened the Pumas' chances, but with their growling forwards they are still awkward customers. Lost without: Former Bristol scrum-half Agustin Pichot has 47 caps, 12 tries and a nose for the ball. Avoid in a dark alley: At Twickenham in 1990, as an 18-year-old prop in his second international, Federico M\u00cbndez decided to clock giant second-row Paul Ackford. Nice. Words of wisdom: 'We did things with common sense, I shouldn't be thanked,' says Loffreda, desperately needing a spin doctor. The home view: 'The big news is there is no news. For the first time in five World Cups there have been no major controversies,' says Frankie Hegas of the Buenos Aires Herald. OSM prediction: Having beaten France twice and gone close against South Africa this summer, they pose a threat to any of the top teams.
