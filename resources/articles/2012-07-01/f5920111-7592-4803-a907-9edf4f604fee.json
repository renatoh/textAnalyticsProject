The American referred to him as \"Mr Leader\". It would have been less embarrassing had the visitor called him \"David\", because at least that would have suggested that Mr Romney knew his surname. One thing Mr Miliband has been battling against over the past two years, a struggle that has faced and often defeated predecessors as leader of the opposition, is to be taken seriously as a candidate for prime minister. A crucial dimension of that battle is to demonstrate to your domestic media and voters that you are a respected figure on the international stage \u2013 or, at the very least, that foreign leaders vaguely know who you are. Deeply embedded in Labour's collective memory is the humiliation inflicted on Neil Kinnock when he went on a pre-election pilgrimage to the United States and was made to kick his heels in a White House waiting room before being given an insultingly brief time with Ronald Reagan. Mr Miliband thinks he has been making some progress in filling himself out as a plausible next occupant of Number 10. Yet here was a man who will be the most powerful politician on Earth if he defeats Barack Obama in November and he couldn't put a name to the Labour leader's face. The look of alarm I saw in Mr Miliband's eyes told me that he feared this had the potential to be a mini version of the Kinnock calamity. So there were sighs of relief in the leader's entourage that the moment went largely unnoticed by a media almost totally consumed by the Olympics. In so much as it has been clocked, the unfortunate encounter has been taken as an example of the \"Romneyshambles\" that the American made of a visit to London during which he stumbled from blunder to gaffe, which included talking about what was supposed to be a confidential briefing with the intelligence services and badmouthing his host's preparations for the Games. The British reserve the right to gripe about the Olympics themselves, but we don't want to hear criticism from a know-all Yank. There was a much more satisfying international liaison for Mr Miliband earlier in the week when he crossed the Channel to visit the Elys\u00e9e Palace. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is a real president rather than just a wannabe. He knew Mr Miliband's name. The French socialist is much more of an ideological soulmate for the Labour leader than Mitt Romney could ever be. And he granted the Labour leader his entr\u00e9e to the Elys\u00e9e Palace ahead of David Cameron. These things may be of little interest to most of us, but they matter a lot to leaders. It would be usual for the prime minister to get an invitation to call on a new French president before the leader of the opposition. Mr Miliband's aides were keen for it to be known that the French president had also broken protocol by posing for a grin-and-grip on the steps of the Elys\u00e9e, an honour normally granted only to heads of government. Though it may be denied on the French side and is shruggingly dismissed by Number 10, there was an element of Gallic payback on Mr Cameron. The prime minister very vocally supported Nicolas Sarkozy during the presidential election and snubbed Monsieur Hollande by refusing to have a meeting with him when he came to Britain to campaign for the votes of French expats. Since then, Mr Cameron has caused further irritation by saying he will \"roll out the red carpet\" to any of the wealthy French who want to flee across the Channel to escape increased tax rates. Monsieur Hollande has waspishly dismissed that comment as an example of \"British humour\". I'm told the president and prime minister will meet at the Olympic Park tomorrow for a date arranged around a handball match. That may be fun: the handball, that is. Beyond the petty aspects of diplomatic point-scoring, it makes sense for Monsieur Hollande and Mr Miliband to reach out to each other. From the Frenchman's perspective, Mr Miliband is a potential future British prime minister. After all, Labour currently enjoys a double-digit opinion poll lead over the Conservatives and the coalition is increasingly fractious. From Mr Miliband's point of view, Monsieur Hollande is something of an inspiration, both personally and ideologically. He is the first socialist president in a generation in a country that traditionally prefers to put conservatives in the Elys\u00e9e Palace. Mr Miliband is likewise hoping to disrupt the usual pattern of history by becoming the first Labour leader since 1974 to take his party back into government after just one term in opposition. During his run for the presidency, Monsieur Hollande was widely scorned as unauthoritative, uncharismatic and undynamic \u2013 a candidate with all the steel of a creme caramel. Even when he was ahead in the opinion polls, there were many forecasts, a lot of them emanating from sceptics on his own side, that the French would decline to put him in the Elys\u00e9e. The triumph of a geeky social democrat over a showboating conservative is another encouragement to Mr Miliband, the self-confessed Wallace lookalike. More significantly than that, Monsieur Hollande is the most important voice on the continent contending that Europe needs to make a decisive shift in its approach to the economic crisis by putting much more emphasis on stimulating growth and creating jobs. This fits with Mr Miliband's convictions and the way he wants to wage his domestic struggle with the Tories. Advocacy of a new approach by leaders abroad helps him to paint David Cameron as discredited and increasingly isolated in the prime minister's insistence that there is no alternative to austerity. The Labour leader has called it \"Camerkozy economics\", a phrase that nicely evokes the thought \"kamikaze\". The Labour leader privately tells people that \"the next election will be a change election\", meaning by that to express something more profound than just the hope that people will be so sick of having David Cameron at Number 10 that they will want to swap him for Ed Miliband. It is his belief that we are in the death throes of an entire ideological age, an epoch spanning the three decades since Margaret Thatcher took power in Britain and Ronald Reagan in America, in which markets were generally revered and the state was generally despised. He recently told Labour MPs that the next election will be of similar significance to the elections of 1945 and 1979, an election that doesn't just change the government, but also resets the country's long-term ideological direction. For many in his party's ranks, it is exciting to be told that the centre of gravity of British politics is shifting left. For others, including some very senior Labour figures, it is a gamble that makes them very nervous about their prospects if Mr Miliband turns out to be wrong. To Tories, it will be his greatest ultimate weakness. Says one Conservative strategist: \"The Hollande visit, like everything else he does, paints Miliband into a red corner.\" It is fine being in the \"red corner\" so long as enough voters are ready to join you there. The evidence for Mr Miliband's belief is mixed. He is obviously on fruitful territory when he attacks the abuses of the bankers and his contention that there has to be a better way to do capitalism sounds more resonant with every scandal that erupts from the City. But saying that people have lost trust in the markets is not the same as saying that they have rediscovered faith in the state. It is very important to Labour that it has now edged ahead of the Conservatives on the crucial question: \"Who do you most trust to run the economy?\" But thoughtful Labour people, including people close to Mr Miliband, acknowledge that this is a \"soft\" advantage that has more to do with declining public confidence in the coalition's economic strategy than a settled conviction among the voters that Labour has the right answers. Labour is currently very quiet on how it would address the deficit beyond saying that it wouldn't be cutting the way the government is cutting. By the time of the next election, it will have to look fiscally credible and have robust answers on tax and spend, terrain that has been a minefield for Labour in the past. Here the example of Monsieur Hollande is not so much inspirational as cautionary for the Labour leader. The French president's poll ratings are already beginning to droop now that he has to square his more extravagant campaign promises with the reality of governing during austerity. If the French and other continental social democrats can demonstrate a way out of the economic cul-de-sac in which Europe is stuck, then this ought to be good news for Labour. But if it all goes horribly wrong for Monsieur Hollande, it will not be Ed Miliband but David Cameron who will be giving French lessons to the British electorate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
