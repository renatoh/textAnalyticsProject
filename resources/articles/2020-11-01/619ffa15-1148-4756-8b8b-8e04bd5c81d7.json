When you explained your job to me\u2026\u201d the psychologist trailed off. I knew where this was going. I was here after six visits to the GP in two years, all for unexplained exhaustion. Burnout, I guessed. Whatever that means. It felt like my brain had been tossed into a washing machine, and all of the delicate bits that made it sparkle had dissolved. Everything took three times longer than it should have. Somehow, over the past few years, my already-frayed cognitive controls had just \u2026 evaporated. \u201cI can\u2019t keep it up any more,\u201d I said wearily. \u201cIt\u201d being life. I wasn\u2019t suicidal; I was chronically overwhelmed. The psychologist tightened her lips. \u201cYou know many women in your industry put pressure on themselves to be perfect.\u201d My eyes began to sting. I had a lot on, but it wasn\u2019t anything someone with my experience shouldn\u2019t be able to handle \u2013 I just needed someone to show me how. \u201cThere are women out there my age running the world! All I\u2019m trying to do is send a few emails, keep my house clean, be creative and still have free time! I\u2019m not curing cancer or raising a family. I am just trying to live.\u201d I\u2019d always been chaotic, but this was a new level. The session, I can say with full confidence, was a failure. I left the psychologist\u2019s office with zero helpful tools and as much hope. I had known depression. This wasn\u2019t it. Stress? Anxiety? Sure. But these were byproducts, not the cause. What is wrong with me? As soon as I got home, I collapsed on to the floor and tucked my limbs under myself into a ball \u2013 which I did often. How does everyone else cope with life? It would be another burnout, two more doctors, a blood test, a hormone test, a three-month wait to see a psychiatrist and another year-and-a-half before I had an answer. It turned out, like many women in their 30s, I had been masking severe ADHD my entire life. And like so many more, I had no clue what that meant. Attention deficit hyperactive disorder is a condition that presents at first in childhood but often goes undiagnosed. In Australia, it affects approximately 814,500 people and around five to 7.1% of the population globally. Despite the name, ADHD doesn\u2019t exactly result in a \u201cdeficit\u201d of attention, but more an issue regulating it, making it harder to plan, prioritise, avoid impulses, remember things and focus. On a good day, it\u2019s like watching a train whizz past you while you\u2019re trying to read the text on the side and make out faces in the windows. On a bad, a bird might land in front of you. Curious, you pull out your phone, Google the bird and get stuck in a \u201cpigeons of the world\u201d vortex. You discover cassowary eggs are bright green and in 2005, UK police found a leg of swan in the Queen\u2019s Master of Music\u2019s freezer. Two terrine recipes later, the train has long passed and night has fallen. Dazed, you sink under a dark cloud of self-loathing, lamenting another lost day. You don\u2019t remember what kind of bird it was. The default assumption about ADHD is that it\u2019s what makes little boys disruptive. But it can also make little girls feel like they\u2019ll never be good enough. Statistics have traditionally shown ADHD is more prevalent in males, but recent research suggests this could, in part, be due to misdiagnosis. Unsurprisingly, ADHD in women is hugely under-researched \u2013 females weren\u2019t even adequately included in findings until the late 90s. And it wasn\u2019t until 2002 that we got our own long-term study. ADHD presents differently in girls and boys too. Women are more likely to have inattentive ADHD, rather than the more observable impulsive type. Because of society\u2019s gender norms, girls with ADHD are often dismissed as \u201cdaydreamers\u201d and \u201coverly sensitive\u201d, as if we are a romantic, quirky caricature from a John Green novel or the Disney Princess canon. The frequency of zone-outs, disassociations and meltdowns caused by our hidden internal restlessness and our brain\u2019s inability to regulate information and emotion goes unnoticed. The cherry on top is that girls who do suffer from impulsivity are often palmed off as \u201ctomboys\u201d. As a child who was prone to inattentiveness and impulsivity, I was repeatedly told to \u201cstop daydreaming\u201d, \u201cslow down\u201d, \u201churry up\u201d and \u201cact like a lady.\u201d Overwhelmed by the world, it wouldn\u2019t take much for my cup to runneth over or for me to completely disassociate \u2013 I got very good at both. There are many women like me: \u201clost girls\u201d, so we\u2019ve been called. Chaotic and curious, sometimes we feel like superheroes; other times, super-failures. It\u2019s not always a lack of interest that makes it hard for us to process information, but our brain\u2019s desire to absorb so much of it. We are jacks of many trades, purveyors of information, collectors of hobbies, beginners of tasks and finishers of few. And we all have similar stories of missed red flags that haunt us. When I was nine, my teacher told my parents I was all over the place. I already had the energy for five dance classes a week, netball, French lessons, piano lessons, a book club and school band. However, she thought I still didn\u2019t have enough channels for my \u201ccreativity\u201d and suggested they enrol me in drama school as well, so they did. Did it help me focus? Of course not. Neurodivergent women often slip through the cracks of diagnosis because they can appear smart or gifted. This is because we\u2019re more likely to be perfectionists or suffer from low self-esteem, so we work extra hard to prove ourselves (see also: my burnout). Combined with hyperfocus \u2013 the flipside of the attention coin where one zones in on a single interest for hours \u2013 this results in flashes of brilliance. We\u2019re also experts at masking symptoms. We form habits by mirroring the social behaviours of those around us. You think imposter syndrome sucks? Try keeping it together when your brain is a wind-up puppy doing backflips while singing the chorus of Ricky Martin\u2019s The Cup of Life \u2013 for no apparent reason. And don\u2019t ask what the obstacles involved in dating or starting new relationships might be! As I discovered, burnout is what happens when the mask slips. Your entire world comes crashing down, and you don\u2019t have the executive function to figure out which way is up. ADHD adults take an extra 16 days of absence a year, according to a report by the Australian ADHD Professionals Association, so while it certainly makes life interesting, it is a rollercoaster for your REM sleep patterns. According to the Under the Radar Report, released 25 October by ADHD Australia, there is a lack of education and understanding around the condition. The pandemic has caused ADHD children to feel swamped by the struggles of at-home learning, and adults like me are burning out. Anxiety in those with ADHD is skyrocketing, with 52.4% of children and 64.7% of adults reporting an increase. Keep in mind, neurodivergent conditions often co-present with other mental health disorders, so the scales are already tipped. \u201cIt\u2019s been a living hell with no escape or support, I\u2019m mentally exhausted,\u201d a parent of an ADHD child is quoted as saying in the report. Alas, if there ever was a time where neurotypical people could relate to the anguish of fuzzy focus, it\u2019s now. That absence of motivation and productivity you\u2019re feeling from stress? It\u2019s not far off. The chaos of the pandemic has activated everyone\u2019s fight or flight response and time-blindness. The new normal sees us assaulted by a relentlessness stream of backlit information stained with emotion and outrage. Anxiety is high. Stunned by stimulation, suddenly it\u2019s harder than ever to silence the background noise. Blend all this with the pressures of attempting to work at a regular pace in an irregular environment, without allowing room for adjustment, and you\u2019ve almost got an ADHD tasting plate. Seven months on, my diagnosis has become something of a bereavement \u2013 I\u2019ve cycled through many stages of grief. I am comfortable with my chaos and relieved I now have answers and an arsenal of tools to prevent me from falling into a hole again. But I keep thinking about all the other lost girls out there. I find myself angry and sad, mourning on behalf of my younger self. I mourn the unnecessary pressure and all the times the world was too loud, bright or grotesque. I mourn the things she forgot, the skills she could have learned and the relationships her impulsivity, perceived detachment and unhealthy coping mechanisms sabotaged. But most of all, I mourn time lost. Because even though my neurodiversity has sometimes made me the loudest person in a room, because I was a woman, nobody noticed. \u2022 If you or someone you know is struggling with ADHD, ADHD Australia has a list of support groups around the country. \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.
