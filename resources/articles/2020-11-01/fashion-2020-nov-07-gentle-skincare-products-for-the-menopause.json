Both stopped me in my tracks last week, and that in itself speaks pretty poorly of the current offering. Menopause, an inevitability for half the world\u2019s population, routinely affects skin condition, structure and appearance quite dramatically \u2013 yet the very products designed to help are practically never kind enough to use \u201cmenopause\u201d for the benign and quotidian word it is. A nation\u2019s hormones will feel grateful to Indeed Labs for not being so pathetically squeamish. Me-NO-pause is its new, euphemism-free product duo for women experiencing the sensitivity, extreme dryness, flushing, dullness and other skin complaints associated with female middle-age. First up we have Cooling Mist (\u00a319.99 for 75ml), a very lovely spritz of instant calm. It contains chilling cucumber extract and calming magnesium, as well as the glycerin and hyaluronic acid one would expect, to top up moisture levels at any time of day. It\u2019s so gentle that anyone could use it \u2013 even with retinols \u2013 to no ill effect. The accompanying Restorative Cream (\u00a324.99 for 50ml) is also carefully conceived. I expected an unctuous ointment, but the texture is much more elegant. Calming stalwart allantoin, phytoestrogen extracts, some good fatty acids and antioxidants all make for a gentle but helpful cream that doesn\u2019t leave flushing skin smothered in oil. Very good work all round. While we\u2019re on perfectly helpful but rarely spoken words in beauty, let\u2019s talk about microbiome specialist Gallin\u00e9e\u2019s new Perfume-free Cleansing Bar (\u00a310 for 100g), approved by gynaecologists for use everywhere, including the outer vulva. As someone who only has to flip open a fruity shower gel before acquiring a scorching case of cystitis, I had the Gallin\u00e9e lightly lathering within an hour of opening the post. I\u2019ll spare you the details, but it works. The key is its pH of 5.6 \u2013 exactly the same as a healthy downstairs \u2013 whereas most cleansers leave things too alkaline and disrupt the balance of the microbiome, causing irritation, itching, yeast infections and the dreaded UTIs. I\u2019m delighted to have discovered it, as my beloved Derma Sukin Daily Wash has been discontinued (if you see it, grab it \u2013 I\u2019ve rinsed eBay) and, unlike my other favourite for intimate washing, La Roche Posay\u2019s Lipikar Syndet AP+ Shower Gel (\u00a312.35 for 400ml), the Gallin\u00e9e isn\u2019t packaged in plastic. Back to more glamorous \u2013 if possibly less crucial \u2013 things next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
