She added that the Hollywood star Sean Penn \u2013 who met El Chapo at an encounter arranged by Del Castillo \u2013 was not under investigation, nor was anyone else involved in the production of a proposed biopic of the drug boss. Officials now want to question Del Castillo over possible money laundering after evidence emerged to suggest that Guzm\u00e1n sank drug money into her company, G\u00f3mez said. Del Castillo, whose \u201cHonor\u201d tequila brand was supposed to be launched this month, has stayed silent on the allegations against her and any relationship with El Chapo, although in a brief statement on Twitter last week she said she would eventually tell her side of the story. The one-time telenovela starlet \u2013 known for candid criticisms of the governing Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) \u2013 has come under intense scrutiny since El Chapo\u2019s arrest 8 January in his home state of Sinaloa. Widespread media coverage of her contacts with Guzm\u00e1n, fed by copious leaks from investigators and spiced with speculation over the exact nature of their relationship, has at times taken the spotlight off proceedings against the cartel boss, as well as other stories of crime and corruption, such as the arrest last week of former PRI governor Humberto Moreira on suspicion of embezzlement, money laundering and bribery. \u201cSince El Chapo\u2019s arrest, most of the story has evolved into one big telenovela,\u201d said security analyst Jorge Kawas. \u201cFew have asked the tough questions: who in politics is behind Mexican drug trafficking and other criminal organisations?\u201d Surveillance photos published last week by El Universal showed Del Castillo and Penn arriving in Mexico for their trip to meet El Chapo at a hideaway in the hills of Sinaloa, while text messages between the starlet and the cartel boss suggested that El Chapo was interested in the actress for reasons unrelated to film-making. But some commentators have expressed skepticism about the leaked text messages between Guzm\u00e1n and Del Castillo, who came to fame with her portrayal of a female cartel boss in the TV series La Reina del Sur (Queen of the South). \u201cIf Kate del Castillo committed a crime, she should be punished,\u201d wrote columnist Mario Campos. \u201cBut enough of this show to turn a TV villain into a real-life public enemy.\u201d Leaked information from investigations has come to characterise some of Mexico\u2019s most notorious cases. After the brutal murder of photojournalist Ruben Espinosa, activist Nadia Vera and three women in a Mexico City apartment, details from the investigation regularly appeared on newspaper front pages \u2013 but only those which reflected the official line that the killings were unrelated to death threats received by Espinosa and Vera for their work in Veracruz state. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s arrest was a major coup for the government, but evidence suggests that targeting cartel kingpins does little to stop the flow of narcotics or prevent drug-fuelled corruption. Meanwhile, Mexico has appeared unable to dismantle illegal financial networks that launder drug money and bind the cartels to networks of business and political patronage, said Kawas. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to go after someone like Kate del Castillo, a public figure who\u2019s famous and recognisable by many Mexicans,\u201d Kawas said, \u201cthan to go deeper into the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s intricate network of financial and political facilitators.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
