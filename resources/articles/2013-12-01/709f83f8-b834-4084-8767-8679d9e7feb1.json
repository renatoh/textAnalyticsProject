Discovery New School, a primary in Crawley, West Sussex, is to have its funding agreement terminated and will shut in April, schools minister Lord Nash said in a letter to the school's governors. \"I have no confidence that the academy trust plans will enable it to recruit and retain the high-quality permanent staff and senior leadership that it needs in order to improve at a rapid pace,\" Nash wrote in the letter to the school's governors outlining the decision to terminate Discovery's funding. The school was rated as inadequate and placed in special measures by Ofsted in May, and subsequent visits found no improvement, with inspectors saying Discovery's teachers were not confident teaching reading, writing and maths. The announcement came a day after an Ofsted report following the reinspection of the Al-Madinah free school in Derby said the school \"remains in chaos\". Discovery's claim to be using its free school status to offer a curriculum based on the Montessori education system was disputed by senior members of Britain's Montessori community, who say they warned the DfE of the school's likely failure three years ago. Philip Bujak, chief executive of the Montessori Schools Association, said he went to the DfE to offer to help Discovery, which he said was thought to be ill-equipped and unprepared, before the school had even opened. \"We were ignored completely,\" he said. Bujak was invited to join Discovery's governing body three weeks ago. He said the Montessori Schools Association \u2013 which has 679 schools as members \u2013 was ready to help re-establish the school, but the DfE's decision meant it was not given the chance to save it. \"The net result is the waste of a large amount of taxpayers' money, the name of Montessori tarnished through ignorance, and a large number of parents very badly let down,\" Bujak said. Labour pounced on the closure as vindication of its criticisms of the free school programme \u2013 which allows independent groups to bid to open schools outside local authority control \u2013 and the decision to allow them to recruit untrained teachers and staff. \"This government promised that the free schools programme would bring the rise in education standards we need, but instead, as the National Audit Office reported this week, it has led to a huge waste of public money and poor standards and now ministers are having to close one down,\" said Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary. \"David Cameron is damaging standards by allowing free schools to operate under a complete lack of local oversight, transparency and accountability and by allowing them to hire unqualified teachers.\" Henry Smith, the Conservative MP for Crawley, was among those unhappy at the decision: \"I am deeply disappointed by the Department for Education's decision to close Discovery New School from next April and am disturbed by the failure of management and lack of support.\" But a DfE spokesman said free schools were held to account more rigorously than other state-funded schools, compared with local authorities that presided over schools in special measures for long periods. \"We have moved to close Discovery new school just seven months after its inadequate Ofsted rating. This shows we will not hesitate to act swiftly and effectively if children are not getting the education they deserve,\" the spokesman said. Natalie Evans of the New Schools Network, which supports groups making applications to open free schools, said the majority of free schools were delivering a good education. \"Like any school, if free schools are underperforming they must be held to account. While realising how difficult this will be for parents and students at Discovery New School in the short term, we believe this is the right decision,\" Evans said. The decision has shocked parents of the 65 pupils at the school, who will be allocated places at nearby state primary schools by West Sussex county council when Discovery closes. Joanne Todd said her son had thrived at Discovery, where he has been a pupil since it opened, and she fully backed the new management. \"My son has done nothing but excel at this school. We're trying our hardest to turn the school around but they're not giving us a chance,\" Todd said. \"I totally believe in Discovery new school, I have no qualms about it. To me, that is my child's future and I will continue to fight for it all the way.\" The school issued an unsigned statement saying that staff and students were \"deeply disappointed\" by Nash's decision. \"Ofsted's last published observations were just 12 days after our new interim headteacher was appointed into her new role. Since then the school has accelerated a programme of improvements and much has changed already. Our children, staff and community love this school and we'll be considering our next steps over the coming days,\" the statement said. Discovery's founders claimed that the school used a \"Montessori curriculum and approach,\" and the school's failure has caused disquiet among the British Montessori education community. Because the name Montessori \u2013 after Maria Montessori, the Italian founder of the education movement that emphasises independence and self-discipline among pupils \u2013 is not trademarked in Europe, there was no bar to Discovery using the term despite not being accredited. The founders of Discovery \u2013 the former head Lindsey Snowdon, who resigned in October, and her husband, Andrew \u2013 approached the Montessori Schools Association for aid but refused to go through an accreditation process or commit to hiring suitably qualified teachers. Meanwhile, the DfE said it had denied a request to fund construction of two grammar schools in Kent. Under DfE rules, funding can only be provided for new academies or free schools."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
