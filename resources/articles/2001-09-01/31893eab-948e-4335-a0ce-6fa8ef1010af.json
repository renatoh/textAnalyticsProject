Like any great singer, the Icelandic diva (the term, reserved for opera's charismatic women, is apt) is bent on redefining the parameters of music itself. Pop is a word she now disdains. Instead, she has gravitated towards domains hitherto regarded as the preserves of classicism. A few weeks ago, she appeared at London's St John's Smith Square, the Baroque sanctum of early music and Lieder. Now she has arrived at the home of English National Opera. \"Crossover\" is a word that conspicuously fails to describe what she is attempting. This isn't opera, though what Bj\u00f6rk has absorbed into her work is opera's spaciousness, its theatrical and musical extravagance and its ritual potential. What she presents us with is effectively the modern equivalent of classical music's post-Romantic enormity. An orchestra erupts at her feet, shrouding her in hieratic Wagnerian pomp. An Inuit choir serves as her acolytes. Vast video screens carry a stream of images: a frozen Nordic landscape in the first half, symbols of germinating life in the second. Fluttering across the stage like some strange force of nature, Bj\u00f6rk herself seems part human, part spirit. Her songs blend the earthly, the erotic and the mystic. Embrace envisions sexual submission to an unnamed male deity. Elsewhere the lyrics become more blatant. \"When I wake up in his arms, he's still inside me,\" she sings at one shudder-inducing moment. Her voice uniquely captures the experiences she describes. I can think of no other singer who can swerve with such vertiginous conviction from guttural earthiness to seraphic innocence. \"I never thought I would compromise,\" she sings at one point. I doubt whether she ever has, though she has often been prepared to collaborate. In addition to classical forces, she works here with Matmos, a group of lethal, disturbing brilliance. They underpin Human Behaviour with pile-driving throbs while Bj\u00f6rk delivers it with a vengeful fury, far removed from the laconicism of the single. Matmos's opening solo set combined performance and body art. Sound is produced by electronic implements gliding over and into flesh, the images projected onto a screen behind them. Plectrums slide over hair. What looks like a screwdriver probes orifices, at one point jabbing into a cavity in a tooth. Surgery and sadomasochism are dauntingly mixed. I confess to being no expert in this music - but I was completely hooked by every stupendous second."}, "isHosted": false}}}
