Eriksson maintained that his controversial restriction was not due to him bowing to the wishes of clubs, but to his desire to protect his players amid a packed fixture calendar. Indeed, he argued that \"if no-one else thinks about the fixture list then someone has to do it\". The Football Association are now attempting to broker some sort of resolution to a damaging situation in which the England team continue to give all the ground and the clubs stand firm. Acting FA chief executive David Davies will chair a summit meeting next month between Eriksson, leading club managers and the Premier League to find some room for compromise. He has a tough job on his hands but inaction is not an option for the FA. That much was clear at Upton Park as the arrival of an experimental under-25 side in the second half did little to lift the gloom. The lessons of England's dire collapse against Australia were two-fold; the first-choice team did not seem to take a devalued game seriously enough in the first half and were then prevented from putting their failings right. Australia striker Mark Viduka, who stayed on for 84 minutes in a side ironically mainly drawn from the Premiership, was surprised to see Eriksson stick so rigidly to his game-plan. \"I thought maybe he was going to change his mind because they were in trouble. If I'd been on a team losing like that, I don't think I would have wanted to go off. It would have been a pride thing,\" he said. Pride was not the issue, however. David Beckham led a deputation to Eriksson during the interval, asking for the team to be allowed to remain on the pitch to rectify the 2-0 deficit. \"Beckham was the first to come to me and I don't know how many others. Of course they wanted to put it right and that's very good,\" revealed Eriksson. \"But I told them it wasn't fair and that it was time for the others to play. They can have their revenge against Liechtenstein and Turkey.\" David James admitted it was \"possible that some of the players' minds were elsewhere in that first half\", yet insisted that \"we wanted to get back out there and try to make amends but we weren't given the opportunity\". Sol Campbell added: \"I really wanted to keep going but you have to be professional. Mr Eriksson is in a tight position as the club managers want their players fit and fresh for the weekend.\" That would effectively give the FA Cup tie between Arsenal and Manchester greater importance than the England national side, however, while James, Michael Owen, James Beattie, Frank Lampard and Kieron Dyer are not playing on Saturday. Despite not having given any binding assurances to clubs, Eriksson nevertheless stood firm in his attitude to friendlies with a forthright defence of his outlook. Accepting that he could force players to stay on for 90 minutes, he insisted: \"I can do that but I honestly don't think it's fair. \"Many of those players played on Sunday, will play again on Saturday at midday and then play in the Champions League the next week. \"I'm not saying that the FA Cup is more important than the England team. Absolutely not. \"But you have to remember this was a friendly and I think 45 minutes was good for them. Every time they have a chance to play together, even for 45 minutes, is good. \"For them to play longer would be very good in an ideal world, but you kill them and I'm not prepared to do that. I'll defend the policy of 45 minutes until I'm dead as it's the right thing to do.\" The problem for England is that Eriksson is the only one willing to give ground, with the clubs' solution effectively being to scrap friendlies altogether. If that happens, we might as well all give up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
