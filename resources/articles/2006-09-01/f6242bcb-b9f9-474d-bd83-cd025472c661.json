The selection is carefully varied. Some of it is familiar enough, with the impressionist seascapes of Arnold Bax's Tintagel, moving via Vaughan Williams's The Lark Ascending (with the Hall\u00e9's leader Lyn Fletcher as the aerial soloist) and his First Norfolk Rhapsody to Delius's Summer Night on the River and On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring. But there's also Finzi's less often played elegy for orchestra, The Fall of the Leaf, all that survives of a projected triptych begun in the 1920s. Also included are two pieces that give the Hall\u00e9 Choir their moment in the spotlight - an extract from Elgar's neglected cantata King Olaf and John Ireland's setting of James Kirkup's The Hills. All of the performances are perfectly judged and the orchestral playing is predictably first rate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
