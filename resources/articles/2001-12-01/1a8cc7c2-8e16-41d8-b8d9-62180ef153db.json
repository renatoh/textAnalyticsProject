The French-trained raider was one of 10 horses to stand their ground for the \u00a3150,000 contest at the confirmation stage. First Gold finished only third over hurdles at Newbury at the start of the month, sparking questions over his wellbeing, but his trainer said: \"I was pleased with that run. It was too short a distance for him and he schooled very well over fences the other day. It might be a slightly stronger race than last year's but he is a year older and stronger.\" Florida Pearl has been confirmed a definite traveller to Kempton next week by trainer Willie Mullins, who said: \"Florida Pearl goes to Kempton and Paul Carberry will keep the ride if he is available. I hope to finalise my jockey arrangements tomorrow.\" \u00b7 Neil Callan will be stood down for the mandatory 21 days after being knocked out for five minutes when falling on May Princess at Lingfield yesterday. The jockey was expected to spend the night in Redhill hospital."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
