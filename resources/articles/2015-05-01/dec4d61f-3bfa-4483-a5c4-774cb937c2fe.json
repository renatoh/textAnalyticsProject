Southgate selected Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Harry Kane, whom he described as the \u201cpin-up\u201d, but left out Shaw after being minded as late as Tuesday evening to take him to the tournament. The England Under-21s manager continually refused to give any detail regarding the injury to Shaw. The player suffered a concussion in the 2-1 win at Crystal Palace on 9 May which caused him to miss Sunday\u2019s 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford. England Under-21s\u2019 next match is the warm-up with Belarus on 11 June, a month after that head injury, and the tournament starts a week later in the Czech Republic. The expectation would be that Shaw should have recovered from a concussion by then, which suggests he has another, more serious injury. Yet asked about this, Southgate indicated United had told him not to expand. He said: \u201cA couple of squads ago we had a couple of injuries where we talked about detail and clubs are preferring us not to go too far.\u201d Southgate could offer no explanation when it was put to him that Shaw should be able to recover in time from a concussion for the Euros. \u201cI cannot answer that. These young players are not ours, we don\u2019t own them,\u201d he said, before claiming Louis van Gaal, the United manager, wanted Shaw to participate. \u201cLouis has again been very supportive of him coming.\u201d Last Friday, though, Van Gaal was vocal in stating Shaw should not be included on the basis the 19-year-old could suffer burnout. \u201cI can\u2019t comment, don\u2019t need to and don\u2019t want to comment on that,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIt is not a case of a rest, it is a case of him not going to be fit for us. We have 27 players [on the long list] who if we were giving the clubs the option of resting them they would take it.\u201d The coach was clear that if a concussion were revealed by him the player concerned could be vulnerable. \u201cWe had a couple with injuries in the last camp and we started to go into detail of \u2018It\u2019s head\u2019, et cetera and clubs aren\u2019t very keen on that,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThey could go into fixtures the following week and someone could target that. I know historically we have always said: \u2018He has a groin, he has a hamstring, he has a \u2026\u2019 Are those days over? Possibly. From our perspective, with younger players we probably have a duty not to go down that route,\u201d he said. Southgate seemed unclear if the policy would extend to the senior team and that if, say, Wayne Rooney had to withdraw from a major tournament with an injury the FA could not identify it. \u201cYou would hope to get a timescale and an idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know the timescale with this one: he is not going to be fit for the tournament.\u201d Tottenham did not want Kane selected, either. But Southgate believes the striker is a different case \u201cbecause Harry is fit, he is not injured\u201d. He added: \u201cOf course, we are mindful in selecting Harry that he has had a long season, many of the players here have.\u201d Southgate agrees that Kane, who will be given a week off before joining up with the squad because of Spurs\u2019 post-season trip to Malaysia and Australia, will be the player identified by the opposition as the team\u2019s \u201cWayne Rooney\u201d, despite other talented players, including Saido Berahino. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t suggest you have that conversation with Saido \u2013 but his [Kane\u2019s] world\u2019s changed enormously,\u201d said Southgate. \u201cHe\u2019s the pin-up boy and it\u2019s a wonderful story and we hope this is the next part of it.\u201d Southgate is clear Kane can handle the pressure. \u201cHe\u2019s got a really strong mentality, he\u2019s very focused in his practi ce, he\u2019s very focused in his belief in himself,\u201d the coach said. England\u2019s opening group game is against Portugal on 18 June. They face Sweden three days later and Italy in the final match of the phase on 24 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
