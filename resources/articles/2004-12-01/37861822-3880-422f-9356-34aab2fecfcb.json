The stars are the two biggest names of basketball's post-Michael Jordan era, and their confrontation - prefaced by verbal sparring worthy of Mike Tyson at his worst - is expected to break all viewing records for Christmas Day sporting events. This explosive instalment sees Shaquille O'Neal, a 7ft 1in behemoth, returning to his old Los Angeles stamping ground for the first time since he was forced to leave town in controversial circumstances. There he will come face-to-face with Kobe Bryant, the former team-mate credited with engineering O'Neal's departure and falsely accusing him of paying hush money to women, who is still battling a rape lawsuit of his own in the civil courts. The showdown between Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers and O'Neal's Miami Heat at the Staples Centre was concocted by the NBA fixture planners shortly after last summer's trade broke up the sport's most powerful tandem. What then appeared a mouth-watering clash between two giants who had brought three successive titles to Los Angeles has mutated into something far more salacious. No sooner had O'Neal recorded a rap song dissing his one-time colleague than the text of a Bryant interview with Colorado detectives investigating a rape allegation against him became public last September. \"Bryant made a comment to us about what another team-mate does in situations like these,\" wrote Detective Doug Winters in his official police report. \"Bryant stated he should have done what Shaq does. Bryant stated that Shaq would pay his women not to say anything. He stated Shaq has paid up to a million dollars already for situations like this.\" A 32-year-old father of four, O'Neal has never been accused of sexual assault. His response to the charge added fuel to the fire. \"This whole situation is ridiculous,\" said O'Neal. \"I never hang out with Kobe, I never hung around him. In the seven or eight years we were together we were never together. So how this guy can think he knows anything about me or my business is funny. And one last thing: I'm not the one buying love. He's the one buying love.\" The \"buying love\" jibe was a reference to Bryant spending $4m (\u00a32.1m) on a ring for his wife Vanessa shortly after the story first broke of the rape charge stemming from his late-night sexual encounter with a Colorado hotel employee. Although the criminal rape case was dismissed before coming to trial, the leaking of documents pertaining to it brought to the boil a long-simmering feud between two of the NBA's biggest stars. The truth is they never actually got along. Even when the combination of Bryant's finesse and O'Neal's sheer power took the Lakers to three successive titles between 2000 and 2002, they barely tolerated each other. The then coach Phil Jackson, who spent a large portion of his time trying to ensure the ongoing battle of the egos did not unduly affect the team, wrote that towards the end of their time together Bryant would even refuse to have his ankles taped by a club trainer he felt was too friendly with O'Neal. With their relationship deteriorating on and off the court, the unfancied but far more united Detroit Pistons took full advantage in last summer's NBA finals. That defeat prompted the club to act. Jackson, whom Bryant despised, did not have his contract renewed and O'Neal was traded. One of the big two had to go and the management decided it made more business sense to sign the 26-year-old Bryant to a seven-year $136m (\u00a371m) contract. The dynasty that had been expected to dominate the league for the rest of the decade was in tatters. So far the move has worked out better for O'Neal. He is so adored in Florida that Miami's American Airlines Arena has been dubbed \"The Love Shaq\" and, motivated by the change of scenery, he has managed to lose nearly three stone from his monster frame. With the slimmed-down giant forging a thrilling new partnership with the up-and-coming superstar Dwyane Wade, the Heat have made their best ever start to a season. They entered Thursday night's clash with the Sacramento Kings looking for a 10th consecutive victory. \"I don't have to make a point,\" said O'Neal of his return to Los Angeles. \"I'm George Bush. I'm the president. I built that arena, so I don't have to make a point. I think it'll take us out of what we're trying to do for me to go in there and try to make points.\" Although Bryant has been individually brilliant in this campaign too, the revamped Lakers are reckoned to be a couple of years away from contending and his personal popularity continues to plummet amid a growing belief that his troublesome personality will continue to dog the franchise. Sales of his jerseys are down nationwide and rumours of on-going problems with team-mates were strengthened by an incident earlier this month in which he accused an injured Laker, Karl Malone, of trying to chat up his wife during a game. As the dust settled from that incident, the beleaguered Bryant embarked on a round of television interviews in which he very obviously attempted corrective surgery on his burgeoning bad reputation. \"I can't sit up here and say I'm not at fault at all for anything that took place,\" said Bryant. \"I mean, if I could go back and do some things differently, I would. I never intended in any way to mix him [O'Neal] into my troubles and difficulties that were going on at the time. I just apologise to him for that. December 25 sounds like a good day to me to kind of talk to him and tell him I never meant in any kind of way to bring any of his personal business out.\" The olive branch was not exactly grabbed out of his hand. O'Neal refused even to comment when reporters put the question to him about whether he would accept an apology, and he maintained his policy of not even referring to Bryant by name. Meanwhile he sat out his team's victory over the Boston Celtics last Tuesday night due to a calf injury that many suspect is merely a ruse to save himself for the Lakers game. \"If you've got a Corvette that runs into a brick wall, you know what's gonna happen,\" said O'Neal when asked about the possibility of a physical confrontation with Bryant. \"He's a Corvette. I'm a brick wall. So you know what's gonna happen.\" As if the prospect of Bryant's irresistible force meeting O'Neal's immovable object were not enough, the curtain-raiser for television audiences involves the Indiana Pacers taking on Detroit, the reigning league champions. The last time these two teams met, the Pacers' Ron Artest had a fight with a Pistons fan, sparking the most disgraceful brawl in recent NBA history. It looks perfect holiday fare."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
