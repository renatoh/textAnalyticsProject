In Sparta, places in the pecking order \u2013 for men, at least \u2013 were determined by success in mortal combat; in Georgian England, ranking was by gentility and learning. Today, the principal badge of status is money, and the things money visibly buys. Britons, like our American cousins, increasingly say we \"make\" a certain amount in salary, as if wages were a physical manifestation of labour. Even though most salaries are now paid electronically, the idea of the \"wage packet\" retains its grip on our imagination. I earn, therefore I am. Since the financial crash of 2008, the issue of pay and the value we assign to it has become particularly divisive. The salaries and bonuses of bankers, predictably, have come in for notable scorn. Giving evidence to a committee of MPs, Stephen Hester, the new boss of RBS \u2013 dubbed \"the best-paid civil servant in the land\", given the nationalisation of the bank \u2013 said: \"If you ask my mother and father about my pay they'd say it was too high\u2026 some people close to me have that view of bankers.\" Hester will earn almost \u00a310m over the next three years if the bank bounces back; his dad is a chemistry professor. The public anger has become so extreme that some executives have even seen the wisdom of refusing big pay rises or bonuses \u2013 or flat-out denying that they are worth the exorbitant fees they receive. Earlier this month Sir Norman Bettison, Chief Constable of West Yorkshire police, described his own \u00a3213k salary and pension package as excessive and blasted the futile efforts of the public sector to compete with private pay levels. As the former Shell boss, Jeroen van der Veer, conceded after stepping down last year with a pension pot of $34.2m: \"You have to realise: if I had been paid 50% more, I would not have done it better. If I had been paid 50% less, then I would not have done it worse.\" For most of us though, these figures are almost impossible to conceive or evaluate. According to the Office for National Statistics, in its 2009 Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, the average UK salary is \u00a325,816 (or \u00a328,270 for men and \u00a322,151 for women). But money is not everything. What really intrigues us is how much our boss is getting paid. Or the guy two desks away who spends all day on Facebook and then leaves on the dot of 5.30pm. Statistics consistently show that we care less about our actual pay level than we do about earning more than our colleagues and neighbours. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics at Warwick University, conducted a major study that revealed we would rather be the second-best-paid person in a firm or department than the second-worst-paid \u2013 even if, in the latter case, the salary is actually higher. Rank is what really matters, not cash. The individuals interviewed for this feature are mostly a little disgruntled with their work and how they are remunerated. Many of their complaints will have a familiar ring to them. The anonymous member of the BA cabin crew bemoans how the job has changed in the 14 years she has worked for the airline. Staff reductions mean she is highly unlikely to be promoted; budget constraints ensure that many of the perks she came to expect have been removed. \"I'm less fulfilled than I used to be, because it's become a different job,\" she concludes. Dave Dowling, a postman for more than half his 45 years, tells a similar story: longer hours, heavier bags of mail and \"a poor reward for the type of responsibility we have\". Both professions have been involved in controversial strikes over the past 12 months. The good and bad guys in these disputes have been far from clear-cut. Royal Mail claimed that the action undermined the postal industry at a time when mail volumes were already plummeting by almost 10% year-on-year. British Airways stood firm, pointing out that the average salary of its cabin crew, with bonuses and allowances, was nearly \u00a330,000, double that of Virgin Atlantic and a third more than easyJet. Members of parliament, meanwhile, have faced a different set of pressures. Lynne Featherstone, the Liberal Democrat MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, was declared by the Telegraph as one of \"the saints\" in the expenses scandal, but has found her profession discredited in many eyes. She describes her salary, a whisper under \u00a365,000, as \"reasonable\". So, how much do we need to earn to make us happy? Work by the Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman suggests that, above a certain point, a higher wage delivers little in terms of personal wellbeing \u2013 although low pay is not good for anyone. \"Money does not buy you experiential happiness, but a lack of money certainly buys you misery,\" he says. These findings are echoed by the burgeoning research literature on happiness, suggesting that once salaries break the \u00a340,000 a year mark, there are diminishing returns in terms of wellbeing. A study by the recruitment company Jobsite.co.uk found the average employee would be more than satisfied with a salary of about \u00a338,000 a year. Of course, this figure is still a third more than the current average, but it suggests there may be a point at which people recognise that \"making\" more money is, in itself, an empty enterprise. Professions that enjoy a high status, or involve plenty of human contact, seem to generate much higher levels of happiness. In the City and Guilds biannual survey of professions, hairdressers are consistently scored as the happiest workers in the UK, despite very modest financial rewards, because of strong social ties at work and good relations with clients. (The profile of the UK's happiest worker was a 60-plus female beauty therapist living in the northeast; the least content was a builder in his mid-forties from Northern Ireland.) Other jobs that involve providing a valued service \u2013 from doctors and childcare workers to accountants \u2013 result in happier workers. John Lewis is owned by its staff and is the only major company in the UK with the happiness of its staff as its founding mission. And job satisfaction rates are indeed high in the partnership, not because of the money, but because staff have a genuine stake in the future of the organisation. Groucho Marx once quipped, \"What makes wage slaves? Wages!\" But when the workers are the paymasters, too, the slaves have taken over the plantation. This is another sign that pay has become political again. In place of the pre-1997 concern with low pay, there is now an argument raging about fair pay. The Tories have pledged to enforce a 20:1 ratio between the best-paid and lowest-paid in any public organisation \u2013 a reaction to the fact that over the past two decades, the earnings ratio between the top and bottom 20% of employees has widened from 15:1 to 75:1. Labour introduced a one-off tax on City bonuses, and a new 50p top rate. With the minimum wage removing the most egregious examples of poverty pay, attention has turned to those at the top of the pile. Some Labour MPs are calling for a maximum wage commission. A fair day's pay for a fair day's work, once a rallying cry to raise salaries at the bottom, is now a mantra for those wanting to lower pay at the top. There is no escaping the status-sensitivity of human nature, or Madison's \"distinctions\" within human societies. Pay matters, in symbol as much as size, and will do so for the foreseeable future. But our attitudes to money are at a potential tipping point. The wage packet will always be weighed, but perhaps other factors \u2013 power, happiness, respect \u2013 will now be added to the balance. Fiona Johnson: Cabin Crew, 45, \u00a325,000 I am on \u00a319,000 basic. The difference comes from flying allowances, which depend on where your trips are to. A four-day Tokyo trip, for instance, might earn you \u00a3700, but you only do that about once a year. Most of what we do is to the United States, and a Stateside night stop earns you \u00a3100. It's a huge concern that I'll never earn any more. I've got a degree, I'm well educated, and when I started I was told categorically that within two years I'd be made a purser \u2013 but BA has taken two pursers off each aircraft, so now they're overcrewed and I'll never be promoted. I absolutely can't survive on any less than I'm on at the moment, which is what's in the offing. It's a monthly juggling act with bills, especially because my income varies so much each month. I'm always on the edge of my massive overdraft and if you're ill or on leave you only have your basic pay \u2013 so no one can afford to be sick, and I didn't go on leave for years. I'm a single mum; my child was five when I started working, and no nanny would fit into my irregular working pattern, so I had to rely on friends and family. You're not at home for the school play, or the Christmas lunch. On the plus side, my child is very well travelled. I'm less fulfilled than I used to be because it's become a different job. You fly with different crew every time, but you used to get a bus to the terminal together, and after the flight you were allowed to buy some drink from the aircraft so the ride to your hotel was very sociable. They've put a stop to everything like that, and there's not that ability to gel any more: everyone's much more isolated. They've also cut down on the length of trips and the number of crew on board, so you're more tired when you get to a destination. You spend most of your days off asleep, or trying to sleep. Dave Dowling: Postman, 45, \u00a318,200 I have always enjoyed meeting people \u2013 on a regular post round you get to know some of them pretty well and make friendships, but there's a lot of pressure now to get the job done as quickly as possible. When I first started you used to have a single bag of mail and your delivery was two and a half hours long. Now you can get six or seven bags, and it takes three and a half hours. By the time you get home you're pretty tired. You start by sorting the mail at 6am and finish around 2pm. The bags are a maximum of 16kg \u2013 most postmen cram it in to try and get it finished \u2013 and the trolleys can have anything up to 80kg of mail in them. It's physically and mentally demanding: you've got to be concentrating all the time. If I'm out on delivery and I've got a special delivery item and I was to lose that item I could lose my job. But we get a poor reward for the type of responsibility we have. If the average pay was just over \u00a320,000, I would think I'm worth at least that. When I started, our pay used to be pegged to that of a police constable. I'm not saying it should be today, but that's the change that's happened. There are very limited opportunities for a delivery worker to earn extra money \u2013 for instance, through overtime. The only thing you can move on to is the management grade. But you have to be a unique person to enjoy being a postman \u2013 to go out in all weathers and do the hours we do \u2013 and most of those like the outdoor lifestyle, and wouldn't want to go into management, even if they could. The vast majority of delivery workers are the main (or only) earners in their family. I've been doing this job 25 years and I'm the sole income for my wife and seven children. We cut our cloth accordingly, and where others might go on long holidays we know we won't be able to. It's increasingly hard as the children are moving up in school, because we don't want them to miss out on anything like music lessons, trips and the other things that will give them a rounded education. But I'm proud of being a postman, because of the culture and the way people view postmen. Laura Aspinall: Social Worker, 24, \u00a328,000 The job wears you down. Sometimes the children are lucky to be alive by the time I'm involved. It's a 37.5-hour week. You have to be realistic and make sure the caseload isn't more than you can manage. They're changing our hours to make us more flexible as there are families we can't see in the daytime and we do work quite a few late nights. That's a good thing, but I worry about the morale of the team when we're spending more time on our own and working from home. I started on \u00a319,000, and in the first week I was doing a child welfare investigation with another worker and looking at placing the child of a drug-addicted mother at birth. As I work frontline with children and in an impoverished part of the countrywhere there's a lot of risk involved, I get a supplement of \u00a3200 a month. But I still think we're underpaid. My great frustration is that I've been told for a long while that I'm good enough to progress to the next level, and I've taken on tasks beyond my job role, but there's no recognition of that. I just have to wait until a post becomes available. I think that happens to quite a few people: from the team I started with, I'm the only social worker left, and a lot of them have left due to issues of career support and progression. We do a tough, responsible job and if that was recognised it might keep us in the job longer. The general perceptions of social work are vague and detrimental. I wish there was a drama series like The Bill or Casualty that showed what we do, the battles we're faced with procedurally, bureaucratically and the rest, and that, actually, we do do our best. Lynne Featherstone: MP, 58, \u00a364,766 I work a seven-day week. There are no boundaries at all between my working and home life. It is an intrusive lifestyle, but you don't know how long you're going to be in it, so you give it everything. I'm a workaholic. An average day might start at 6am when I check my emails, and finish at Westminster at 11.30pm. One of the most draining parts of the job is surgery; most casework can be done on the phone and by the time people get through to see me it's normally something very serious. It can be upsetting: sometimes everyone in the room is in tears. Things like the Baby P case are particularly stressful. When Victoria Climbi\u00e9 died I saw the Labour leadership get away with it. Eight years later, I thought \"I'm damned if I'm going to let them get away with it again.\" I was quick to put head above the parapet, determined to take action and raise the profile of the case, and that was stressful as I hadn't been used to that sort of media storm before. I have a reasonable salary. Compared with lots of people it's a jolly good salary, but compared with others it's not very good. I think it should be pegged to whatever an equivalent is in the private sector. I strongly believe that MPs shouldn't decide their own pay, that it's for others to judge. I live in London although I could have had a second home \u2013 it seemed to me completely ridiculous, and not a good use of public money, so I refused it. Maybe it's because I'm a grass-roots campaigner, I see this job as a mission, not a right. I don't know how people have time to have outside interests \u2013 I certainly don't. \"Bob\" Hoskins: Royal Navy Rating, 28, \u00a330,000 I used to be an operator, sat on the radar. Now I'm the man that fixes it. I've done eight years' service, I've deployed to the Middle East and the Mediterranean, and next week I'm going back to join my ship in the Gulf for anti-piracy operations. When you're on board it's quite cramped and it's deemed as unpleasant living, so you don't pay for accommodation at sea. But when you're based on shore you're charged a nominal fee of \u00a380 a month for a cabin which is in effect a hotel room. As it stands, I rent a flat in Portsmouth, which means I can go on leave at the end of the day to my home comforts. I joined up on \u00a310,000, which isn't a lot. I'd been working for Halfords and I actually took a drop in pay because at basic training you have to pay for food and accommodation: about \u00a3220 a month. It doesn't leave you a lot, with a house and a child to maintain. It was 2002 when we were covering for the firefighters who were on strike, so I was expected to do their job, and then go to sea. Those early days were difficult. I often thought, \"I need to get promoted soon.\" It spurred me on. The pay grades have steadily increased since then. I now earn quite a respectable wage compared with other people. The armed forces' pay review body has rewarded us well, and people are happy with the structure. We have a good pension scheme so I don't have to think about the future, within reason. It's a good lifestyle; the hardest part is leaving my children \u2013 you can be deployed for up to seven and a half months. But what I earn and how successful I am will put them through university. Sarah Aldous: Teacher, 30, \u00a336,000 The money definitely didn't entice me when I decided to train to be a teacher, but it didn't put me off as I knew it was what I wanted to do. The classic line about teachers is that we get a lot of holiday, but keeping up with lesson planning and marking can seem to be a round-the-clock job. Even after six years' teaching I'm unable to get all of my work done within the hours I'm physically in school. I arrive at 7.30am and leave at 5.30pm and I take work home at weekends, so there's a feeling the holidays make up for our less-than-exorbitant salaries. The main way to increase your pay is by gaining seniority and just by keeping teaching. After six years you go \"through the threshold\" from the main pay scale to the upper pay scale. My concern would be to match teachers' pay to that of other graduates, otherwise what incentive is there for a talented graduate to go into teaching? The pay mentioned in advertising campaigns is definitely misleading. Posters do a good job of portraying some of the positive aspects of the job \u2013 seeing the look on a child's face when they understand \u2013 but touting good pay as a reason to go into teaching is a little far-fetched. A couple of years ago I applied for a role at a private school. I didn't take the job partly because the salary was lower and the pension was a lot worse \u2013 the teachers' pension plan is excellent. For me there are three main parts to a satisfying career: the money, the work and the people you work with. I have a great group of colleagues, I earn enough to live comfortably, and I love what I do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
