The future of Ken Moss, a former player and once seen as Wasps' chairman-designate, is unclear after his dream of buying the club its own home was put on hold. Moss saw owning their own stadium as a key part of the rescue plan put in place last spring, but on Saturday, after the club had won their first game under new ownership, the current chairman Mark Rigby said they would remain tenants at High Wycombe for at least two years. \"It will certainly be a minimum of two seasons and probably three,\" said Rigby, further confusing the situation regarding Moss, someone he once played alongside. On Friday, when the consortium announced it had finally taken control, it was said that Moss's future was still being \"finalised\". A day later there were suggestions that Moss's job might be done, although the club is still to reveal the identities of its new backers. According to Rigby that will happen \"within weeks\" although he declined to be more precise. \"We have a small group of people who have a belief in the business and the future of the business, but they are back-seat investors,\" said Rigby. \"It's not unusual in business for people to be private about their investments and for the moment they want to remain private while we sort out board structure.\" However, Rigby was less circumspect about the decision to continue as tenants of Wycombe Wanderers. \"Rather than run off on day one and try and find a stadium deal, it would be a insult to the creditors who have supported us through this trading period when money has been very tough,\" he said, adding: \"They believed we would get across the line and then they would get paid. We have to stabilise the integrity of the company before we think of multi-million pound stadium deals. Frankly if I was a creditor I would be insulted if that was the first pronouncement. I'd say 'sort my bill out first please'.\" According to Rigby, the club is still \"haemorraghing\" money and will announce a further \u00a32m loss in its next trading figures. Season ticket sales are down to around 3,000 and the club still has to tie in a shirt sponsor, but after Saturday's performance that could be a deal waiting to happen. After close defeats against Harlequins and Bath, Wasps finally ran away with the game, scoring four tries while coming from behind after half-time. Unsurprisingly, Stephen Jones was named man of the match on debut after taking the game by the scruff of the neck in the second half while completing a perfect kicking display worth 23 points.
