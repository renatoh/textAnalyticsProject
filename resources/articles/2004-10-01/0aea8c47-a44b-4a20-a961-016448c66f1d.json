Like old-time prizefighters in a bout with 100 rounds, Fallon and Frankie Dettori had been trading winners for months to set up the tightest race for the Flat jockeys' championship in recent years. It was a contest made all the more compelling by the contrasts between the two men. Dettori is the natural, born to the game as the son of a champion jockey. Fallon is the hard man from a tough background, who fought his way up on the northern circuit. Horses seem to run for Dettori because they want to. They seem to run for Fallon because they would rather not find out what will happen if they don't. When they arrived at Leicester yesterday to go head-to-head in six of the eight races on the card, Dettori was 10 winners clear of his great rival. By the time the gloom closed in, the Italian had ridden a treble and Fallon was on his way to Leicester Royal Infirmary. If yesterday's fall in a very ordinary Monday-afternoon card does not eventually prove to have decided the championship, Dettori will be as relieved as his rival. He will be abroad for a week, in the United States for the Breeders' Cup and then Australia for the Melbourne Cup, during the last days of the turf season, and was keen to build up a good lead before he departed. It was never his intention to win this title by default. Yet win it he now surely must, with Fallon needing to overcome medical opinion as well as his rival's 13-win lead. Dettori's re-emergence as a champion has been thoroughly deserved. He is so wholly the public face of racing, from his long spell as a team captain on A Question Of Sport to the flying dismounts captured on the back pages, that many casual sports fans probably think he is the champion jockey, and always has been. But it is not so, and has not been for nine long years. Dettori won his first championship in 1994, and retained the title the following season. Soon afterwards, however, he decided to concentrate on quality rather than the grinding, seven-days-a-week pursuit of winners that our very British way of deciding the title demands. When he almost lost his life in a plane crash in June 2001, and decided on his return to avoid light aircraft, an essential tool for most top-flight jockeys, it seemed impossible that he would ever again amass the sort of figures needed to win the championship. In the US they would laugh and tap their heads at our obsession with numbers. There, prize money is the deciding factor in the jockeys' titles, as it is for the trainers on this side of the water. Where our riders are concerned, though, money is vulgar and quantity is all. The result is that the fourth race at Leicester yesterday - the Stoat Selling Stakes, worth \u00a32,306 to the winner - is worth every bit as much in championship terms as the Derby, first prize \u00a3800,000, which Fallon won on North Light back in June. There is no tangible prize attached to the jockeys' title, not even an official memento to put on the sideboard. But still it matters, and matters very deeply, to the men in the weighing room. The champion jockey is the top dog in a ferociously tough and competitive pack. The swagger that comes with the title is a prize beyond price. And now that spring in the step, that air of first among equals, will belong to Dettori once again. He has talked in recent weeks of the months, even years, after the plane crash when his appetite for riding was intermittent, at best. And of the day when Catherine, his wife, told him to \"start being a jockey again\". The effect has been extraordinary. From the first days of the campaign, Dettori has been riding at even the most humdrum meetings with the flair and polish that had been evident only at the biggest events in recent years. His treble at Leicester yesterday was a perfect example, each ride different in its way but each executed with the assurance of a supreme talent at the height of his game. The Stoat Selling Stakes, as it happens, turned out to be one of them, and a metaphor too for the fortunes of both Dettori and Fallon. Fallon was quickly away on Smart Boy Prince from his outside draw in stall one, and did brilliantly to get his mount across to the lead on the inside rail. All the while, though, Dettori was stalking him on Yashin, and when he swept past two furlongs out he was going so well that you could almost imagine him letting out a snigger. Yashin has a reputation for lacking courage, but he went clear as he pleased by eight lengths. Dettori will now do the same to claim his third title. His thoughts yesterday evening will have been with his fellow jockey, undergoing a series of hospital tests. Over the season as a whole, though, the simple fact is that the most stylish and naturally gifted rider of his generation is back at the top of the pile."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
