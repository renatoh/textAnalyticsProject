For months NBC News has been trying to rebut reports that it suppressed former correspondent Ronan Farrow\u2019s investigation into sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Its parent network, NBC, has also been dealing with the fallout from allegations of sexual abuse and harassment from its once top presenter Matt Lauer. Now NBC \u2013 which presides over America\u2019s top-rated nightly newscast, as well as the longest-running television news series \u2013 faces a new public relations headache. NBC has faced a storm of criticism following reports that it fired the African American presenter Gabrielle Union after she spoke out about racially insensitive behavior and other problems on the set of the hit show America\u2019s Got Talent. The prominent women\u2019s advocacy group Time\u2019s Up has denounced NBC\u2019s handling of Union, telling the Guardian it fits a \u201cpattern of the network protecting the careers of powerful men at the expense of women who speak out\u201d. This week Time\u2019s Up launched a petition encouraging signatories to demand the network \u201caddress its toxic workplace culture, once and for all\u201d. That is a big ask. The Union affair illustrates the media giant\u2019s ongoing struggles with the #MeToo era as one of the most storied names in American broadcasting has lurched from crisis to crisis and endured widespread criticism from across the industry \u2013 and even from some of its own biggest media names. Hollywood has firmly rallied to Union\u2019s side, with pop star Ariana Grande and actor Kerry Washington, among others, expressing support. The petition was tweeted out approvingly by actor and director Elizabeth Banks. The biggest actors\u2019 union in the country \u2013 along with NBC itself \u2013 is now investigating what occurred during Union\u2019s one-season stint on the show. \u201cNot only did Union reportedly endure and witness racist and inappropriate behavior \u2013 including racially insensitive comments and excessive criticism about her physical appearance,\u201d Tina Tchen, the chief executive of Time\u2019s Up, said in a statement to the Guardian, \u201cbut it also appears she was punished for speaking out: The company labeled her as \u2018difficult\u2019 before ousting her from the show altogether.\u201d The story began quietly enough. On 22 November, news broke that Union and fellow judge Julianne Hough were leaving America\u2019s Got Talent \u2013 the talent contest show helmed by Simon Cowell \u2013 after a single season. But Variety, the entertainment industry trade publication, subsequently reported that Union, who is black, had been dismissed following a number of racially charged incidents. They included a time she expressed concern about a joke made by guest Jay Leno that alluded to Koreans eating dog meat (it was removed from the show before it aired), and Union repeatedly being told her hair was \u201ctoo black\u201d for the show. Another report from Vulture flagged Union\u2019s frustrations after producers allegedly discouraged judges from supporting a young black rapper on the grounds that they needed to choose an act \u201cthat America can get behind\u201d. Hough, the other AGT judge leaving this season, said she had a \u201cwonderful time\u201d on the show. NBC and Fremantle, the show\u2019s production company, responded in a statement at the time saying, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent has a long history of inclusivity and diversity in both our talent and the acts championed by the show. The judging and host line-up has been regularly refreshed over the years and that is one of the reasons for AGT\u2019s enduring popularity.\u201d This week NBC and Fremantle met with Union for a five-hour \u201cfact-finding meeting\u201d. Both parties deemed that first conversation \u201cproductive\u201d, and the network has announced its intention to launch a deeper investigation into the reported incidents. NBC said in a statement that the \u201cinitial conversation was candid and productive. While there will be a further investigation to get a deeper understanding of the facts, we are working with Gabrielle to come to a positive resolution.\u201d And Union tweeted approvingly that \u201cI was able to, again, express my unfiltered truth.\u201d That NBC is taking her complaints so seriously is a belated sign that the network has realised the impact of the repeated scandals and a testament, perhaps, to the power of whistleblowers. That\u2019s according to Farrow in an appearance this week on The View, a popular daytime show on rival network ABC. \u201cIt is very clear that source after source is saying there is a systemic cultural problem with this kind of toxicity at NBC,\u201d Farrow said. \u201cI think we\u2019re seeing the consequences of what happens when you sweep these kinds of problems under the rug.\u201d They are consequences Farrow would know something about. In his bestselling Catch and Kill, Farrow alleged that disgraced mogul Weinstein worked every connection he had at the network to achieve his desired effect: NBC ordered a stop to Farrow\u2019s reporting. What\u2019s more, Farrow states specifically that NBC attempted to suppress his reporting after Weinstein threatened to reveal sexual misconduct allegations against the network\u2019s former star host, Lauer. NBC has repeatedly denied attempting to stop Farrow\u2019s reporting, arguing the allegations put forth in his book \u201cpaint a fundamentally untrue picture\u201d. \u201cWe have no secrets and nothing to hide,\u201d the NBC News president, Noah Oppenheim, told staffers in an October memo. \u201cThere is no evidence of any reports of Lauer\u2019s misconduct before his firing, no settlements, no \u2018hush money\u2019.\u201d But Farrow has some very public supporters at the network. Chris Hayes a host on MSNBC, NBC\u2019s cable network, has used his own airtime to support Farrow\u2019s reporting and express his consternation at how his employer had handled Farrow\u2019s early work on Weinstein. Rachel Maddow has also addressed the issue on her own show, calling for an independent investigation of the network\u2019s conduct. But in another memo to staff sent around that time, the NBC News chairman, Andy Lack, sounded notes similar to Oppenheim\u2019s rebuttal. \u201cAfter seven months, without one victim or witness on the record, he simply didn\u2019t have a story that met our standard for broadcast nor that of any major news organization. Not willing to accept that standard and not wanting to get beaten by the New York Times, he asked to take his story to an outlet he claimed was ready to publish right away. Reluctantly, we allowed him to go ahead.\u201d Less than two months later Farrow published a Pulitzer prize-winning story in the New Yorker that Lack in his memo said \u201cbore little resemblance to the reporting he had while at NBC News\u201d. In his book, Farrow had reported former NBC news employee Brooke Nevils\u2019 allegation that Lauer had anally raped her at the Sochi Olympics. And Lack, in his memo, also contested the notion that NBC had ever been aware of complaints about Lauer\u2019s conduct prior to Nevils\u2019 allegation. The NBC legal team\u2019s \u201cexhaustive investigation\u201d of records and interviews of staff had \u201cuncovered no claims or settlements associated with allegations of inappropriate conduct by Lauer before he was fired,\u201dhe wrote Lauer, who would go on to be fired in 2017 following multiple sexual misconduct allegations, confirmed he had a relationship with the woman in question but maintains it was \u201ccompletely consensual\u201d and vehemently denies all allegations of rape and coercive conduct as \u201ccategorically false\u201d. But Farrow asserts that in fact the network paid out multiple settlement agreements to Lauer\u2019s accusers in the years leading up to the complaint. Nor is he alone. In interviews last year, a dozen current and former NBC staffers told the Washington Post they had been sexually harassed while working at NBC but chose not to report it, and three women said they had been harassed by Lauer specifically. Lauer responded: \u201cI fully acknowledge that I acted inappropriately as a husband, father and principal at NBC. However, I want to make it perfectly clear that any allegations or reports of coercive, aggressive or abusive actions on my part, at any time, are absolutely false.\u201d Even before revelations about Lauer and Weinstein became public, NBC was already facing scrutiny for failing to run the Access Hollywood tape in which Donald Trump brags about sexually assaulting women. The tape was later leaked to the Washington Post, whose reporter went on to win a Pulitzer prize. That NBC will have an independent investigator look into the latest dust-up with Union shows they are perhaps taking these issues more seriously. But after the meeting this week with Union, her lawyer Bryan Freedman said he was still \u201cwaiting to see the next steps on whether NBC is going to make sure that there are real changes\u201d afoot. Contacted Friday afternoon by the Guardian, he added his team had \u201cnothing to update at this time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
