Lyndhurst, who played Rodney Trotter in the BBC comedy classic, said Only Fools and Horses would not get made today because TV companies preferred overnight ratings blockbusters such as Simon Cowell's ITV1 show. \"Only Fools would never be made today, nor Dad's Army,\" he told the Radio Times. \"TV companies turn down good scripts because they're not prepared to let them develop. A talent show will pick up 7 million viewers, and they can't afford to nurture something that initially will only have a million.\" Lyndhurst, 52, said that his son Archie, a pupil at the acclaimed Sylvia Young Theatre School, in London, had the \"acting gene\" and wanted to break into showbusiness. \"He's good, even allowing for me being a rose-tinted parent,\" Lyndhurst said. \"I wonder, though, what sort of industry he'll enter. I can hardly say, 'Darling, do all this training and the best thing will be Celebrity Dog Watch.' Take away the talent shows, celebrity cook shows, skating, dog training, dancing, putting people on an island \u2026 and what's left? I've been asked to go on all of them. \"Britain's Got Talent? Hundreds of years ago, we were selling tickets to Bedlam. It's become like that. It's cruel to watch these deluded people \u2013 the judges as well, sometimes. They don't need to be talented, and that's a shame because you don't want to watch people who can't do it.\" Lyndhurst is the latest prominent TV figure to speak out over the state of British programming. The Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry this month condemned most modern TV as \"violent, cruel and noisy\" and ruled herself out of appearing on \"ghastly reality programmes\" such as BBC1's Strictly Come Dancing and ITV's I'm a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here. Ripper Street's Matthew Macfadyen said the programmes were \"crap and worthless\". Lyndhurst, who is famously publicity shy, returns to the small screen this week in New Tricks. The 10th series of the BBC1 police drama has pulled in 9 million viewers. \"You have to worry if it will continue to be successful,\" said Lyndhurst. \"Lots of shows that run a decade-plus have familiarity. It's comforting to see people you think you know in different situations. Our viewers are people who don't want to play catch-up on their phones.\" He replaces Alun Armstrong (Brian Lane) as the former copper Dan Griffin in the Unsolved Crime and Open Case squad, alongside co-stars Dennis Waterman (Gerry), Amanda Redman (Sandra) and Denis Lawson (Steve). Redman will leave later in the current run, to be replaced by the former EastEnders actor Tamzin Outhwaite."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
