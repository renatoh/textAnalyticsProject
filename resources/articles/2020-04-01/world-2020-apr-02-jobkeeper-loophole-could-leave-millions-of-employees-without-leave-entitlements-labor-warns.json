The opposition spokesman on industrial relations said on Thursday that, according to a treasury briefing to Labor, employees could be forced to exhaust their leave entitlements while receiving the new $1,500 fortnightly payment, transforming it from a \u201cwage subsidy\u201d for employees into a \u201cbalance sheet subsidy\u201d that benefits employers. Labor will take up the issue with the government, along with its advocacy for 1.1m temporary visa holders and 1m casuals with less than 12 months\u2019 service with one employer, who stand to miss out on the jobkeeper payment announced on Monday. It comes as the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, unveiled a suite of changes to modern awards to respond to Covid-19 shutdowns and improve flexibility, which he said could save tens of thousands of jobs and help employers through the downturn. The main two changes are to provide two weeks\u2019 unpaid pandemic leave for all employees and an ability to take double leave at half pay. Burke told an Australia@Home lunchtime briefing, hosted by Essential Media director Peter Lewis, there was an \u201cissue for permanent full-time and part-timers\u201d that emerged from a treasury briefing to Labor on Thursday. \u201cIf you\u2019re stood down, it\u2019s already the case that employers can say you\u2019ve got to use up your leave first, and they start running down your leave,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it looks like will be possible is: if the employer gets the wage subsidy, instead of passing it through to you as a wage, they collect it and still have you running down your leave entitlements. \u201cSo effectively, instead of the government subsidising someone\u2019s wage, they\u2019re subsidising the balance sheet for an employer while the employer simply runs down all the leave entitlements of their employees.\u201d Burke said he was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201cstunned\u201d by the revelation \u2013 because Labor thought the jobkeeper payment was \u201cmeant to flow through to the workers to give them an extra payment, not [flow] through as they collect entitlements they had already earned\u201d. \u201cIt might seem technical but there are hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of permanent workers, who at the end of this will either have some of their leave entitlements or won\u2019t, based on whether this loophole survives.\u201d Burke said this was what the government was \u201ccurrently contemplating\u201d, although it \u201cmight not turn out this way in the legislation\u201d. Labor is also concerned that casuals with less than 12 months\u2019 service with their current employer \u2013 including many workers in retail and hospitality, teachers who move between schools, entertainment and arts workers on forward contracts and many construction workers \u2013 are set to miss out. Unveiling the jobkeeper payment on Monday, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said it was one of many measures to help \u201cbuild a bridge to the recovery\u201d by pursuing a \u201chibernation strategy\u201d. \u201cThis payment will give working Australians their best chance of keeping their job and keeping them connected to their employers so that they can bounce back in the recovery phase,\u201d he said. On Thursday Porter summarised a raft of industrial relations reforms achieved \u201cbehind the scenes in a quiet and cooperative way\u201d between employers and unions. Temporary changes to the restaurant, hospitality and clerks award would change work conditions for 2m Australians during the Covid-19 crisis, allowing workers to move to perform another type of duty in another type of classification and facilitate working from home. \u201cRemarkably, some of the awards were so inflexible it was actually unlawful to work from home,\u201d Porter said. Some 103 modern awards would be changed to provide two weeks of unpaid pandemic leave for all employees, including casuals, and to allow employees to take double the duration of leave at half the pay, he said. \u201cNow, you can see how those common-sense changes would allow the flexibility in a number of businesses, which \u2026 could well make the difference between survival of the business and preservation of the jobs or the failure of the business and the loss of the jobs. So these are incredibly important changes.\u201d Porter thanked the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Industry Group, other employer associations and unions and the president of the Fair Work Commission, justice Iain Ross."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
