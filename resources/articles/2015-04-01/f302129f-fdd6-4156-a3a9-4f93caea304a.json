The Holland international striker was on the bench for the Premier League defeat against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday but played 62 minutes for the under-21s. Adnan Januzaj, 20, and Rafael da Silva, 24, sustained injuries in the game. Januzaj pulled up chasing a ball in the 54th minute, while Da Silva was substituted at the end of the first half after a blow to the ribs. The centre-half Jonny Evans played the full 90 minutes after his return from suspension following the spitting incident involving Newcastle\u2019s Papiss Ciss\u00e9, and nearly scored with a header, saved by Leicester\u2019s Adam Smith. Van Persie, 31, set up Sean Goss for United\u2019s 32nd-minute equaliser after Harry Panayiotou had volleyed in Leicester\u2019s opening goal in the 18th minute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
