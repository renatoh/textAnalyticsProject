However, Gatz lasts eight hours in four parts. Quite something for such a slim volume as the 1925 novel, but this is a word-for-word enactment, a big hit in New York where it was described as \"the most remarkable achievement in theatre this decade\" by New York Times critic Ben Brantley. In this production, by the US Elevator Repair Service company, a cast of 13 play the employees in a small, shabby business office who act out the story of the mysterious Gatsby and the failure of the American dream. No\u00ebl Coward Theatre, WC2, Fri to 15 Jul Mark Cook The Norman Conquests, Liverpool Alan Ayckbourn's trilogy of plays \u2013 set over a traumatic family weekend in Sussex and offering events from three different vantage points \u2013 got a major revival and re-evaluation when it was revived by Matthew Warchus at the Old Vic four years ago. Critics remarked on not just how funny the plays were but also how desperate they seemed, often noting their Chekhovian undercurrents. Step forward that most delicate of directors, Philip Wilson, who's taking on these plays \u2013 each is self-contained, and they can be viewed in any order \u2013 and should be very capable of mining the pain as well as the comedy in a scenario where the sexual ambitions of a manic-depressive librarian unleash chaos, and change everyone forever. Liverpool Playhouse, to 23 Jun Lyn Gardner The Witness, London With her first play Mogadishu \u2013 a gritty drama about race in an inner-city school \u2013 Vivienne Frantzmann scored a palpable hit, picking up a host of awards. Now she has the awkward second play hurdle to get over. The Witness is described as \"a piercing and dark thriller of modern morals\" and focuses on a father and the daughter he rescued and adopted when he photographed her in war-torn Rwanda. Years later, when she returns home from university, tensions rise as she delves into her family history and a secret is revealed. David Ajala, Pippa Bennett-Warner and Danny Webb star, and Simon Godwin directs. Jerwood Theatre at Royal Court, SW1, Fri to 30 Jun MC Petit Mal, Oxford Can circus say something about the state we're in? At its very best it can, as here in this show from Finland which zones in on three young men whose personal relationships seem to be symptomatic of a deeper malaise. It may be emotionally downbeat, but the show offers a series of explosive moments and turns. A young man trampolines as if trying to jump out of his life; another takes out his aggression on the Chinese pole. There is horsing around as the piece explores male friendships, but Petit Mal also hints at a generation looking for meaning and a way to float above the debris. Oxford Playhouse, Fri to 9 Jun LG Sabbat, Lancaster In 1612, 10 people living near Pendle Hill in Lancashire were tried and hanged for witchcraft. The story of the Pendle witches, which continues to haunt the popular imagination, is retold in Richard Shannon's play, first seen at this address in 2009 and now revived to mark the anniversary of the trial and executions. This is definitely not The Crucible \u2013 Arthur Miller's famous play about the Salem witch trials of 17th-century America, written against a backdrop of the the 1950s McCarthy witch-hunts against communist sympathisers. But it does delve into the political and religious currents of the time, and particularly mistrust of anyone displaying Papal sympathies, to show how local resentments and national preoccupations can combine with tragic results. The Dukes, Thu to 16 Jun LG The Girl With The Iron Claws, Plymouth One of several eye-catching new companies to come out of the Edinburgh festival fringe last summer, the Wrong Crowd is a collaboration between writer-director Hannah Mulder and designer and puppet director Rachel Canning. They make for a winning combination of straightforward theatre and surreal performance, and come together here to retell a Nordic fairytale. It shares elements with the classic Beauty And The Beast, but with added trolls and a prince who has been transformed into a bear. But this isn't really for kids: it's far too dark for them, and has themes of sexual desire that place it in Angela Carter, magical realism territory. The show's been reworked since I saw it last summer, but should still have claws. Drum, Theatre Royal, Plymouth, Wed to 9 Jun LG The Royal Ballet: Prince Of Pagodas, London Kenneth MacMillan's last full-length ballet was not his strongest work. Set to Benjamin Britten's score, MacMillan's attempt to revivify fairytale ballet didn't engage his choreographic imagination as fully as the darker psychological narratives of Mayerling or Manon. Still, it's an interesting piece, and with 10 minutes edited from the original score, plus some tweaked choreography, it will be fascinating to see its return after 16 years. It'll also be fascinating to see how a new generation of dancers fare with the material. Sharing the part of Princess Rose are Marianela Nu\u00f1ez, Lauren Cuthbertson and Sarah Lamb. Sparks may fly. Royal Opera House, WC2, Sat to 29 Jun Judith Mackrell Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch: World Cities 2012, London It's nearly two years since Pina Bausch died, leaving a seemingly unfillable gap in the contemporary dance scene. So one of the glories of the London 2012 Festival is a month-long season of Bausch's later works. All 10 pieces are variations of the \"travelogue production\", works created in and inspired by locations including Hong Kong and Istanbul. First up is Viktor, Bausch's homage to Rome, in which the stage becomes a giant archeological dig framing the dancers. Tickets are sold out, so beg for any returns. Sadler's Wells, EC1, Wed &amp; Thu; World Cities continues at Sadler's Wells and the Barbican, EC2, to 9 Jul JM"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
