Was there, Barnett was asked, some underlying truth behind these assaults or was the Mail just out to get the BBC? The answer, of course, came back that the Mail was just out to get it. The sigh of relief, though, was probably a small one. The very act of commission pointed up a nervousness within the Corporation, the anxiety that perhaps it was genuinely unloved. And when I started to talk to people about the BBC, I discovered this anxiety was partly justified. No one I knew seemed to love Auntie any more, except me and, perhaps, the people I knew who worked for her. Just about everybody I came across appeared to have some kind of grievance against the BBC. Why? This slightly sulphurous political atmosphere may explain why, just a few months after she told the world that the future of the licence fee and, therefore, of the BBC as it exists, was pretty well guaranteed, the Culture Secretary, Tessa Jowell, seemed to row back. In the run-up to the renewal of the royal charter in 2006, there would be a 'comprehensive review' of the BBC's role and funding. As one of its first tasks, the new broadcast and digital media regulator, Ofcom, would examine the whole business of the way that public-service broadcasting was delivered. The process could, said the Culture Ministry, rival the work done in Mrs Thatcher's time by the infamous Peacock Report. So the past few months have seen the BBC launch a charm counter-offensive. If, as a columnist and media pundit, you turn around in the pub you find yourself facing a free drink wielded with intent by a top executive who will tell you of the wonderful highbrow things being made by his or her department. As Mark Thompson, ex-BBC bigwig and now top man at C4, remarked a few weeks ago: 'Once every 10 years, as it enters the run up to charter renewal, the BBC has a tendency to rediscover old-time religion.' And the seriousness of this process is underlined by one chilling fact: last Christmas, when the BBC beat ITV hands down in the ratings, the Corporation didn't even boast about it. It said nothing. Triumphaliste, nous ? But it will take years for Ofcom to report and, even when it does, much of the report may well be ignored. So I thought I'd examine the issues for you today by putting the BBC on trial. I'll be laying the charges, calling the prosecution and defence witnesses, evaluating the evidence and deciding the verdict. One thing you need to know, though. I quite often work for the BBC, as does my wife, so I am a somewhat corrupted judge, tainted by a clear conflict of interest. Bear this in mind. Clerk of the court: The first indictment is that the BBC is rich, bloated and wasteful. According to a rather disgusting metaphor invented by Mark Thompson, the BBC wallows in a 'Jacuzzi of cash', provided by the long-term licence-fee agreement made back in John Birt's day. This has seen guaranteed funding increases slightly in excess of inflation. Today, the BBC's annual income from all sources stands at \u00a33.1 billion, roughly the GDP of Estonia or Botswana. The political problem for the BBC is partly that the Birt settlement was made when everything in the economy was relatively rosy and its rivals, while not all flush, were doing OK. Just five years ago, Channel 4, for example, was expanding into new services like Film 4. Newspaper groups also diversified hopefully into potentially lucrative satellite and digital TV markets. Then along came an advertising recession, and suddenly the Corporation was the only outfit with any money. Everyone else began to get cross and jealous. As the very public-service (but rival) broadcaster Jon Snow remarked last autumn: 'Everyone I know who's left my arena to go to the BBC simply cannot believe the resources.' Corporate wealth always brings with it certain kinds of stories. One concerns the 'lavish' lifestyle of the bosses. Last year's pay award for top executives caused a predictable fuss, especially since its announcement coincided with a 24-hour strike by local council workers protesting against a 3 per cent increase. John Edmonds, the GMB leader, seized gratefully on the \u00a3450,000 paid to director-general Greg Dyke, and the \u00a3273,000 for the BBC head of sport. 'Yet again, it seems to be a case of the well paid getting better paid while ordinary workers have to struggle on the crumbs discarded from the top table,' he said. An easy hit. But execs tell me that the Dyke dosh is the going rate in the media business and that a top BBC person is responsible for more people and more budget than, say, the editor of a national newspaper. And they should know, since the churn between the Corporation and other broadcasters is constant and takes place in both directions. Verdict: The BBC runs a whole lot of TV channels and national radio stations and a complete network of local radio. It probably needs and deserves as much money as Estonia, but only if everything is necessary and well done. Judgment suspended. Next charge. Clerk of the court: The BBC has 'dumbed-down', choosing to chase ratings rather than quality. Ah yes. The BBC is paid this licence fee money, runs the argument, to provide what the market will not. It covers for market failure. But the Corporation has joined the Gadarene rush for audience - and young audience at that - at the expense of the public service. Plenty of serious TV folk make this accusation. In recent weeks, these have included Sir Jeremy Isaacs and Jonathan Dimbleby. Just last week, a survey was published suggesting that public confidence in TV is at a 30-year low. Forty seven per cent thought standards had fallen in the previous year, compared with 28 per cent in 2000; 61 per cent said there was too much intrusion into people's private lives; 58 per cent complained about violence and 44 per cent about sex. In the same period, BBC1 overtook ITV in the ratings for the first time. A former BBC scheduler, David Bergg, noted a drop in the number of one-off programmes on the BBC, especially in arts and current affairs, and an increase in soaps and long-running series. Bergg thought that this was a product of more aggressive scheduling, ie more ratings-based scheduling, by the Corporation. The criticism has been constant. Fame Academy on BBC1 was 'derivative', arts programmes had all but vanished; political coverage was in danger of being gutted because young people thought it was boring; current affairs had disappeared in the peak schedules. The BBC has begun to deal with these attacks in two ways: counter-propaganda and reassurance and rebalancing. The counter-propaganda has consisted of getting together packs detailing how many highbrow things the BBC still makes, and of pointing out how US imports no longer appear at peak viewing time (this is a red herring, since US imports rarely draw large enough audiences; where an import does perform, as in the case of the Australian Neighbours , it does find a place). The rebalancing is more interesting and has consisted of actually increasing the funding for Panorama , while not reprieving it from its Sunday slot, of putting more money into political programming, and of beginning to talk at the most senior levels of reinventing the expensive, prestigious, low-audience, high-impact live current affairs. Even so, it is evident that there is a problem. Another BBC friend blames it on the decision taken a few years back to make a split between the channel controllers (broadcast) and the programme-makers (production), in which the former commissioned everything and the latter simply did as they were told. The result has been a drive either for ratings or immediate impact, and an impatience with programmes which, while excellent, have provided neither audiences nor headlines. There is no simple solution here because of what we may call the Dykean Paradox. To justify the licence fee, the BBC must do what the market does not. But to maintain support for the fee, the Corporation must also have lots of viewers. Which tends to be what the market does. The result is a perpetual series of adjustments. In the past few years, it has gone too far in the direction of the market; now, it's the turn, as Thompson has it, of old-time religion. Verdict: Not entirely innocent. Not completely guilty. Clerk of the court... Clerk of the court: The third indictment is that the BBC is funded by a tax that is unfair and anachronistic. And so it is. Last month, Barry Cox, deputy chairman of C4, called for the licence fee to be scrapped. Surely, he argued, what the modern broadcasting world should be based on is individual subscribers choosing what channels to pay for and then forking out. The public-service bit could be safeguarded by a government slush-fund which could give grants to any deserving broadcasters that might apply. That way, people could choose what they wanted and not have a 'cultural tyranny', even a benign one, lording it over them. If that was a blast from the centre-Left, there are plenty of explosions to match it on the Right. Stephen Robinson wrote in the Daily Telegraph: 'I don't get angry about an article that I don't like in the Guardian or the Daily Mail - because I don't have to pay for it - but I am forced to pay for the BBC. I am also paying for a raft of digital channels that I cannot receive, plus the burgeoning website that, though apparently popular in China, is of no interest to me.' Over at the New Statesman, my former colleague at LWT, David Cox, slams a system in which, 'since the BBC's output is consumed disproportionately by the middle classes, the system picks the pockets of the poor to fund the pleasures of the better off'. He goes on: 'The licence fee is a totem for the Guardian-reading, public sector and professions-based \"liberal\" establishment which dominates the formulation of polite opinion. For those people, the Corporation enshrines sacred but otherwise endangered values, attitudes and tones of voice, while keeping at bay unsettling demons such as Rupert Murdoch.' That's me to a cultural T. I am precisely worried that, without the BBC, many of the things that I like to watch - and want my kids to see - will disappear, to be replaced by British versions of Fox TV, in which the news is slanted and minority tastes are ignored. I also note that many of the crusaders are unclear about their own destination. Robinson, for instance, admits: 'I find myself confused, because there is so much that is good about the BBC. The trick is for the BBC to come up with a better plan for funding itself.' It is true that the licence fee is anomalous. It has been anomalous since radio licences were abolished. For years, consumers of BBC radio - those who have no televisions - have paid precisely nothing for their pleasures. It is as strange as National Insurance contributions (which are no such thing) and as unprogressive as parking meters. And, at \u00a3116 a year, it is cheap compared with any alternative that anyone has ever come up with. Verdict: Not guilty, as long as the BBC does what it is supposed to do. Clerk of the court! What's next? Clerk of the court: The BBC is imperialistic and expansionist, using licence fee money to engage in commercial areas and its size to shut out competition unfairly. This is a big charge. Let us return for a moment to Jon Snow, no market Murdochian. Talking to the Society of Editors recently, Snow was scathing about the BBC. 'It's as though there's this one great shark and the rest of us are being kicked about by the currents that its tail creates. It's very difficult to match its clout. It has created a completely unfair competitive environment.' Snow was complaining about how the Corporation used its muscle to make its Westminster shots look better than Channel 4's. But he could have been talking about anything. The complaints come in from virtually every direction. Independent producers, for example, are angry that the BBC has now begun to miss the 25 per cent target for independent commissions. This follows a remark by Greg Dyke that the BBC 'wasn't in the business of making money' for independent producers. One of the directors of Ofcom, Dave Edmonds, has warned the BBC about on-air cross-promotion of its digital services and publications, though it has long since stopped advertising its magazines in this way. But much of the bad feeling concerns the BBC and its new digital services. Chris Smith, the former Culture Secretary, raised questions a few weeks ago about the appearance on Freeview of the BBC joint venture service, UK History. This channel, it has been suggested, compromises the position of services like the History Channel (co-owned by BSkyB and the Hearst Corporation), which must be paid for by subscribers. News 24, the BBC digital news network, has been the subject of a government investigation headed by former Financial Times editor Richard Lambert. News 24 cost \u00a3220 million and competes head to head with Sky News and CNN, and the Lambert Report concluded that the BBC had not done enough to create a distinctive remit, 'setting it apart from other 24-hour news services'. The BBC is now supposedly busy making sure it does just that. Then there's BBC3. Its first proposed incarnation as a youth channel was turned down by the Culture Department on the basis that it offered little that was not already available from commercial broadcasters, especially Channel 4's E4. It took several passes before an infuriated Corporation produced a proposal which satisfied Tessa Jowell. The deal is that the \u00a390m channel has to show some news and a significant proportion of its programming must be original. So why, ask those ubiquitous critics, were these features not built into the BBC's original plan? Even more trouble has been caused by the BBC's plans for the Digital Curriculum, approved by the Culture Secretary in January. The DC is a range of educational aids tailored to the demands of the national curriculum, and will cost \u00a3150m to put together. Schools will receive this online service free. Certainly from the Government's point of view, with schools receiving a cost-free boost to their teaching capacity, that sounds wonderful. But there are two huge problems with the BBC's plans, which have, between them, caused resentment and strife. The first is that there is already an industry which exists to sell teaching support materials to schools, and this industry complains that the BBC is muscling it out. Their estimate that they stand to lose \u00a3400m as a consequence of the DC may be an exaggeration, but it must be a large figure. Just as serious, they argue schools will lose any choice, eventually discovering that only the BBC materials are available. In a late attempt to deflect this criticism, the BBC has promised to limit spending on the core subjects of maths, science and English to just a quarter of its \u00a390m budget, and to spend more on minority subjects where its competitors would earn less. Teachers, however, also complain that the DC is going to be far too prescriptive, based on the BBC's notion of how a subject should be delivered, and not on theirs. Some BBC executives privately agree and wonder how they got so caught up in all this in the first place. Why are they spending \u00a360m on setting up a delivery vehicle for their materials, and on administering it, when that money could, if the Government allowed it, be spent on programmes which might then be offered to anyone to use in schools? 'It's the mindset, David,' said one person to me. 'We think we have to do everything. But we don't.' If it is an illusion, part of what the newly enlightened Mark Thompson described as 'BBC mission creep', it is one that is costing the BBC a lot of support. But before we condemn the Corporation too roundly, there are a few things to remember. It wasn't the BBC that created the disaster of ITV Digital, but it was the BBC, through Freeview, that rescued many viewers from the consequences of that service's collapse. And if the Corporation is getting too big for its boots, then that's partly because the Government has wanted it that way. It has not always wanted a thousand tiny media flowers to bloom momentarily and then wither in the harsh glare of the sun. Instead, it has said: 'Let's have at least one great big, fat flower.' And so the BBC has become Britain's national media champion. Verdict: Half guilty. Much of what the BBC has done has been good in practice, but does it know when to stop? Clerk of the court: The fifth indictment is that the BBC is arrogant and unaccountable There is a problem. The BBC is formally run by a board of 12 governors, appointed by the Government. They, in turn, appoint the director-general and the management of the BBC is answerable to them. Very neat, very accountable and just about totally fictional. In reality, though the chairman might like to have the occasional discussion with the DG, the governors exercise no real scrutiny over the management. How could they? They are not even part-time and broadcasting is now an incredibly complex industry. The Lambert Report described the governors' attitude towards News 24, and its \u00a3200m, cost, as 'perfunctory'. It would have been surprising if it were anything else. Nor does the BBC have to open its books up to public audit, as do other government and tax-funded institutions. Ministers have bought the BBC argument that such inspection would compromise 'the independent status of the BBC and its editorial freedom', leaving it open to political pressure. As a result, there is constant pressure to bring the BBC under the new regulator, Ofcom. This would seem, superficially, to offer a neat solution to the perceived problems of the BBC's relationships with the outside world. Greg Dyke, the physical embodiment of the end of the Age of Deference, may be partly to blame here. His predecessor, Lord Birt, was a man who knew how to deal with government and power, but whose staff could not abide him. Dyke is much-loved by many of those who work for him. He has put huge efforts into telling his people that it's all about them and their creativity, but much less time into defining the institutional role of the BBC and its relationship with the public. 'Greg likes to win,' says one of his supporters. So did Birt, but he never made it so obvious. He was far too political for that. All this has increased the sense that, under Dyke, the BBC does whatever it wants to. The Dead Ringers parody of Dyke as a chippy Michael Caine ('My name is Greg Dyke') captures this perfectly. I would be reluctant to go down the Ofcom path. The BBC is extremely sensitive to opinion. Its self-regulation, which I have witnessed at first hand, is more thorough and sensitive than anything Ofcom is likely to devise. The qualified fiction of the governors acts to permit that extraordinary thing, a genuinely independent public institution. Verdict: A bit guilty but with extenuating circumstances. Sentence: The BBC has been found slightly guilty on three charges, totally guilty on none and completely innocent on one. It is fair for it to escape for the next 10 years with a caution. And the moral? Don't piss off the professional middle classes. We're still a powerful lot. \u00b7 Has the BBC become too powerful?
