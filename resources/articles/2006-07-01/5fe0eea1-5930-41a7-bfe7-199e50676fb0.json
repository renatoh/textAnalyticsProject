Jack Straw, the leader of the house, announced yesterday that the Commons would vote on maintaining nuclear missiles, expected to cost between \u00a315bn and \u00a325bn. The prime minister has promised a decision before the end of the year. \"Of course we should involve the House fully in a decision as important as the renewal of our nuclear deterrent. It is inevitable that there will therefore be a chance for the House to express its view on this important matter in a vote,\" Mr Straw told MPs. The debate has become pressing because Britain's four Trident missile submarines are expected to reach the end of their operational life within 20 years. It received fresh impetus last month when Gordon Brown made it clear that he backed replacement, to the anger of leftwingers who bitterly oppose the nuclear deterrent. There is also wider scepticism about whether it retains its value in the wake of the cold war. The outcome of the vote will depend on the government's choice of the many options for retaining a nuclear deterrent, but it should win despite the opposition of Liberal Democrats. The government can almost certainly rely on Conservative backing, but would prefer to win without. Tory MPs relish the prospect of exposing divisions within Labour. Mr Straw told reporters he believed most backbenchers would back the government and added that the vote would be a three-line whip - meaning MPs are expected to vote with the party rather than with their conscience. \"We would anticipate that the majority of [all] members would support this, but were they not to [replacement] would be blocked,\" Mr Straw said. \"There will be a vote and everybody understands the consequences of it.\" \"It's not as simplistic as replacing it or not; it's about the shape that should take. There's some resistance on the cost basis, as well,\" said Kevan Jones, a Labour member of the defence select committee. He added that the government should be given credit for being the first to offer parliament a say over the nuclear deterrent. Two weeks ago Tony Blair hinted to MPs: \"We are not at all averse to votes of this House on extremely sensitive issues.\" The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament welcomed the commitment to a vote, but warned that it should be preceded by a full public and parliamentary debate and a green paper outlining all the options. Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said it would be vital to have a proper public consultation. Last month the Commons defence committee warned that the government had failed to explain the purpose of a British nuclear deterrent. Its report said the government should explain whether Britain faced a current or impending threat from any established nuclear weapons state and whether possessing nuclear weapons affected its international influence. The Ministry of Defence refused to give evidence to the inquiry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
