Only now it would have to include a relaxed attitude to children. Over-optimistic perhaps. But just because we had a baby in tow didn't mean that we wanted to stay in a glorified kids' club where the little darlings run amok, or blow a year's nappy allowance on one of those family-friendly country houses that resembles an upmarket nursery. Neither did we want to be shushed into a darkened corner by the reproachful looks of childless guests whenever our little missy let out a howl. A case of wanting to have our cod and mash and eat it, before retiring to a calmly decorated room for the night with baby. The Cotswolds hadn't been on our radar because I'd always considered it a Disneyfied version of the country for grown-ups - a big antiques and chintz production. But it was an easy drive from London, and the Priory Inn in Tetbury appeared to be offering a modern take on Posh-tershire at reasonable prices. The website promised \"simple but very stylish\" bedrooms, a gastropub producing \"exciting British cuisine\" and, crucially, it had a section on its family-friendly facilities and staff. So I phoned the hotel - just to confirm my prejudice that they meant children of a manageable age and weren't about to expose their cosy Sunday roast trade to a loose cannon like a colicky baby. \"Not at all, babies are more than welcome,\" said a calming voice at the other end of the line. I was speaking to Tanya Kelly, one of the owners and mother of a three-year-old and nine-monther. A couple of days later, an email landed asking for my wife and daughter's names, the little one's age, and the offer of a Moses basket to save on our boot space. When we arrived at the hotel, there was also a playmat, a selection of toys and a basket of baby essentials - nappy sacks, changing mat, Mothercare toiletries and even a bath thermometer - waiting in our room. A nice touch, and all part of the service of laying on age-specific amusements for each of their small guests. Tanya and Dave Kelly took over the Priory Inn a year ago when it was a \"rather tired hotel\" propped up largely by the bar's regular drinkers. As well as giving the place a facelift and recruiting two Gary Rhodes-trained chefs to put on a menu of modern rustic food, they've also added a takeaway pizza business (think Gloucester Old Spot cured ham with chargrilled fresh pineapple rather than Fiorentina) and coffee bar, whose deep leather sofas, newspapers and toybox are popular with local mums and kids. So far, so promising. The family room that we were staying in was blissfully uncluttered and understated with cream walls and American black walnut furniture. The adjoining room had a couple of comfortable sofa beds and a portable TV, which was just as well as it turned out that we would be spending a fair amount of time in here waiting for the baby to settle down for the evening - and ordering up a meal on the second night when she wouldn't. Mercifully, baby monitors work downstairs in the high timber-beamed gastropub -formerly the stable block for the original priory, its exposed brick walls and bare boards made cosy by an enormous walk-around open log fire. So on the first night we greedily fell upon a menu that ranged from hearty classics such as ham hock with piccalilli and toast followed by braised lamb shank, to the more seductive warm buttered salmon with a juniper and black treacle dressing and a big steaming bowl of moules marini\u00e8re. Ordering was an erratic affair as we took it in turns to heed the call of the baby monitor, but the young waiting staff were unfazed and ever cheerful. I felt for the chefs, but the quality of the food showed no sign of being compromised. Breakfast was much simpler because baby came with; and she showed a maturity beyond her months as she waited patiently for us to finish up a mouth-watering full English. Then her mum selflessly abandoned herself to the irresistible offer of an in-room massage, while I took baby for a tour of the town. The easier option would have been the sleep-inducing car journey over to Stroud where I could have stocked up on goodies from the Saturday morning farmers' market. Alternatively, I could have lulled her with a walk through the ancient forest of nearby Westonbirt Arborteum. But I've never before seen such a concentration of antique shops, and feeling suitably restored, went for the buggy in a china shop option, fully expecting to be turned back before the wheels made it over the threshold. Disarmed again, I was welcomed by the owner of Long Street Antiques who even offered to park up the buggy while baby and I took a tour of the shop's seasoned wares. But be warned, Tetbury is the sort of place where you can pop out for a bottle of Infacol and come back an hour later with a tall-boy.
