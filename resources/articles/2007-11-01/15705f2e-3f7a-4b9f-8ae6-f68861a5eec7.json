Fixed rates hit a high of 7.05 per cent in September, as a knock-on effect of the sub-prime lending crisis in the US. 'Things were starting to calm down,' says Susan Hannums, savings manager at AWD Chase de Vere, 'and rates did start to fall slightly. But now they are creeping back up again and we're seeing a bit of a surge for savers now. If you are happy to lock your money away for a year, this is a fantastic time to do so.' Birmingham Midshires (www.askbm.co.uk, 0845 850 0059) offered the highest interest last week, with 6.92 per cent gross (up from 6.86 per cent) on its one-year bond. Derbyshire building society (www.thederbyshire.co.uk, 08456 004005) is paying 6.9 per cent. 'Birmingham Midshires and the Derbyshire are racing against each other,' says Hannums. Saga (www.saga.co.uk, 0800 300555) also recently increased the rate on its one-year fixed rate from 6.6 per cent to 6.78 per cent gross (for over-50s only). Parents on rocky road with lies to cover young drivers A third of parents lie to save money on car insurance for their children, but the practice could cause claims to be rejected, warns specialist young-driver insurer Young Marmalade. Thousands of parents tell insurers that they are the main drivers of cars that are actually only driven by their children, the insurer says, adding: 'In most cases, parents barely even go near the car - but they've managed to get cheaper insurance by telling the insurer they are the main driver.' The fraudulent practice, known as 'fronting', results in a cheaper policy, because it is less expensive to insure an experienced driver as a main driver - especially as a young driver is typically considered a higher risk behind the wheel. But if a claim is made by the younger driver and the insurer believes the policy to be fronted, the claim will be rejected. Young Marmalade calculates that a 20-year-old from west London as lead driver of a Vauxhall Corsa on a Zurich policy would pay \u00a33,257 to insure, but his or her parents would pay just \u00a31,843 to be insured as lead driver. Time to protect your family from a winter fire tragedy Fire Safety Week starts this Wednesday - and Halifax home insurance is urging homeowners to carry out fire checks to reduce the risk of a blaze in their property. According to the Association of British Insurers, there are 200 house fires a day in the UK. Last year, Halifax dealt with nearly 3,000 fire-related house claims, totalling \u00a323m in repairs. Halifax says most house fires start in the kitchen, and is reminding householders not to pour water on oil flames, but to smother them with a damp tea towel instead. Other tips from Halifax include planning a fire escape route in case of an emergency, checking the batteries in smoke alarms (there should be one alarm on each floor of the house), and keeping internal doors closed at night, as this slows down the spread of fires."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
