The 116-year-old hotel will be branded as \"The Savoy, A Fairmont Hotel\" because it will be managed by the Canadian hotel group Fairmont. The deal is the second between Bank of Scotland, part of HBOS, and the Saudi prince under a joint venture launched last year to buy luxury hotels across Europe. In December, they bought the Monte Carlo Grand, in conjunction with Fairmont. The hotel and restaurant were bought from Quinlan Private, a secretive grouping of Irish investors who spent \u00a3750m buying the Savoy group from venture capitalists Blackstone group and Colony Capital last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
