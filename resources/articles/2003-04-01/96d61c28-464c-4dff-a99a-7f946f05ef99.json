Mine is a passion for non-celebrity biographies, preferably historical, full of trivial detail about the day-to-day regime of other people's lives. If only the Pooters of Holloway and their feckless son Lupin had been real, for theirs are the thoroughly uneventful lives I cherish most. My only criticism of Joe Robinson's affectionate memoirs of his grandmother, who sold fish in the back streets of South Shields at the turn of the century, is that her life was so packed with drama you wonder if it wasn't written with one eye on a television series. As a matter of fact it was. When it was published in 1975, the BBC planned to turn it into a sort of Geordie EastEnders but was pipped at the post by ITV's When the Boat Comes in. Never mind, it's a great book, with Francie heroically combining the resourcefulness of Scarlett O'Hara, the tenacity of Ma Joad and the vulgarity of Florrie Capp. This was a world where working-class wives expected to be beaten by their husbands, cheated by their employers and ground down by poverty. Francie gives as good as she gets, and you warm to her because as well as being loyal and loving, she was also a prize bitch. When she ran a lodging house, she saved her mattresses by giving drunks straw-filled sacks to sleep on, and when she ran a corner shop she was prosecuted for giving customers short measures. The best thing about this audio is Elizabeth Henry, who gives less a reading than an all-singing, all-dancing performance. What a star. Lucia Triumphant, by Tom Holt (8hrs, Isis, \u00a316.99) Classics are hard acts to follow, viz the curate's-egg sequels to Rebecca and Pride and Prejudice. Here's another, which takes up where EF Benson left off in the ever-absorbing rivalry between Mapp and Lucia to be Queen of Tilling. Lucia has been elected mayor but, gracious in victory, has appointed Elizabeth Mapp-Flint (remember she married Major Benjy) as her mayoress. Holt has caught the tone of Tilling to perfection, quaint Irene's malicious wit, the Wises' regal condescension. \"A silence generally fell on the company after Mr Wise had finished speaking. His language was so fine, so Augustan but it seemed a pity to defile its memory with effusions in the vulgar tongue.\" This is definitely Holt triumphant too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
