Overcome is a cast-iron edifice of a debut, constructed by a crack team of producers (Red One, Stargate) and supported by US market-friendly guests (Ne-Yo, Flo Rida). Robo-R&amp;B floorfillers like \"All Night Long\" and \"Dumb\" bear comparison with Rihanna, the obligatory ballads are stirringly belted, while a couple of Motowny numbers form pleasant enough anomalies. And if the whole thing expresses as much personality as Dannii Minogue's brow, who would have expected otherwise?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
