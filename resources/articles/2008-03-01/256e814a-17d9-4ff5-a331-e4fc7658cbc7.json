The Nationwide's monthly report on the property market revealed that house prices dropped by 0.6% this month, adding to fears that the end of Britain's property boom would have knock-on effects on consumer spending and growth. The longest run of monthly falls in the Nationwide index since the depths of the property crash in 1992 cut the annual rate of growth in house prices to 1.1% \u2014 its lowest level since 1996. Fionnuala Earley, Nationwide's chief economist, said prices over the past three months \u2014 a better guide to the underlying trend than one month's figures \u2014 had been dropping at an annual rate of 6% and that further falls were in the pipeline. Ms Earley said: \"Once a general trend in expectation has been formed its effect is likely to be highly influential on both transactions and price levels. This happens by removing the urgency to move and by giving buyers a bigger incentive to drive a harder bargain to hedge against any possible falls in prices.\" The Nationwide said it expected a \"modest fall\" in house prices across the whole of 2008, adding that such a fall would ensure greater stability in the market. This week, the Nationwide was one of the lenders that raised the cost of some of its mortgage products, blaming the credit crunch for difficulties in raising funds to finance its home loan business. With today's government figures for economic growth in the final three months of last year showing that growth in consumer spending had almost come to a halt, City analysts said further cuts in interest rates would be needed to boost the economy. Data from the Office for National Statistics revealed that the economy expanded by 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2007 and by 3% in the year as a whole. The impact of the credit crunch was highlighted by a big improvement in Britain's current account deficit in the final months of 2007 as foreign banks nursed losses on their investments in the City. The shortfall decreased from \u00a318bn in the third quarter to \u00a38.5bn in the fourth quarter. Richard McGuire, economist and fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said: \"The odds of a cut from the Bank of England at its April 10 meeting have risen, as has the probability of a more rapid rate cutting pace further into 2008.\" Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: \"There is little reason to believe that underlying problems facing mortgage lenders will ease any time soon.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
