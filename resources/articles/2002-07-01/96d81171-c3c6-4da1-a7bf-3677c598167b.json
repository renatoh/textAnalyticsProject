The Daily Mail, which published the photo of the weeping presenter on page three, claimed he'd been crying because of his wife's friendship with a comedian. In the Daily Express the following day Ross denied that his wife had anything to do with his tears but seemed unembarrassed by the weeping, and perfectly at ease with his public meltdown. And so were the rest of us. His blubbing was simply confirmation that a classic mould has been shattered, and British man is no longer who he once was. That stiff upper lip has gone as lopsided as an unsuccessful collagen implant. Never again will we believe that he is unflinching before his fate, or superhuman in his self control. The dogged, unperturbable Churchill, the expressionless Jeeves, the steely-nerved Bond: the images that have long branded the British man abroad have been washed away with Mr Ross's tears. When a public man weeps publicly and seems totally unfazed by the incident, his tears say more about the state we're in than the one he's in. The stoicism taught in public schools and expected in public service has been replaced by the indulgent self pity that marks every show of Oprah! and Trish. Stoicism, after all, requires invisible heroics: the swallowing of pride, the camouflage of hurt, these are internal struggles that are not obvious to an audience. Tears instead make for fabulous entertainment - especially male tears. In typical masculine fashion, men who cry do so more loudly and at greater length than any woman; not for them the gentle dabbing of the eyes or the discreet blowing of the nose. No, they've got to snort, hiccup, bawl, and sigh; they go for racking sobs, shaking shoulders and tear-stained cheeks - delivering, in the process, what we have to admit is a thoroughly satisfying audio-visual spectacle. Film makers recognise this: David Lean made Lawrence of Arabia weep at the memory of his torture, and turned the hitherto impossibly perfect O'Toole into flesh and blood; Richard Curtis made John Hannah weep in Four Weddings and a Funeral, and lent some dramatic depth to the otherwise foppish tale. TV producers, too, know the value of a man's tears: from Gilbert Harding, whose tearful interview made headlines in 1959, to PJ in Big Brother, male weepers give great TV. The big man shaken, the tough boy wounded: men's tears may no longer be taboo, but they still give the thrill of the unexpected. He shouldn't, should he, and yet there he goes, boo-hoo, boo-hoo. You can't help but shiver with the excitement of watching someone push the boundaries of acceptable behaviour. It's like the first time someone uttered the four-letter word on telly, or the first time a Prime Minister's wife failed to wear a hat on a royal occasion: what have they done? you squeal in ill-concealed delight. Suppress emotion and you may avoid the humiliation of other people's pity, or risk losing their sympathy. A Briton valued dignity above the soggy noises that constitute compassion: to inspire awe, leading men and generating excitement were far greater achievements than arousing soft and gooey sentiments. No longer. We have come to see being liked as preferable to being admired; the tugging of heart strings has become so commonplace that 'compassion fatigue' has entered our lexicon and 'overcome with emotion' is a mediaspeak leitmotif. Politicians and public figures have quickly realised that they can win more votes or improve their image by the timely shedding of a few tears. Peter Mandelson when he remembered his father's death; Prince Charles when he accompanied his granny's coffin; and Earl Spencer when he spoke at his sister's funeral - all variously improved their standing by showing that red-blooded emotions lay trapped beneath a veneer of insouciance. We may not have taken them to our bosom as a result, but their crying did soften our response to the sinister Minister, the prince we thought so cold and confused, and the errant earl. More important still perhaps, were the tears shed by Gordon Brown at the death of his daughter earlier this year. The Chancellor wept in private, but one intrusive photo of him and his wife Sarah in the back of their car, showed the swollen features of recent tears. Those tears, visible traces of his tragic loss, forever changed our relationship with the iron Chancellor: what was once a distant rapport turned overnight into a tender respect. Soon male tears will be run-of-the-mill. Men in the old fashioned mould, like Tim Henman, say, whose successive Wimbledon losses never reduced him to tearful sobs, will soon grow tired of suppressing their emotions and keeping themselves in check for the benefit of an ungrateful nation. They'll take a leaf from the Jonathan Ross book and weep unashamedly, confident that their tears will shock no one any more. \u00b7 Cristina Odone is deputy editor of the New Statesman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
