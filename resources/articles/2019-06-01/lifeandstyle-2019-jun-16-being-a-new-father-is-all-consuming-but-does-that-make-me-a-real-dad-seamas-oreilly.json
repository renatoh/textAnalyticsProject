Already I know my son\u2019s looking forward to it, the way he watches the calendar, or perks up when I say things like, \u2018Wow, Father\u2019s Day is really creeping on us, eh?\u2019 or last night, when I opened my laptop and found a few tabs open for wacky gifts and nerdy books. \u2018Not very discreet of him,\u2019 I remarked to my wife, who stared at me with a puzzled expression when I showed her his searches from the night before. \u2018But then Amazon\u2019s interface makes private browsing quite hard \u2013 and he is only 11 months old\u2019. Looking forward to such chintzy celebrations is, I\u2019m sure, facile and stupid. But I can\u2019t help it, because I am also chintzy and stupid. I\u2019m aware that simply fathering a child is, in and of itself, completely unimpressive, as evidenced by all the terrible men whose Twitter bios say things like: \u2018dad to 2 beautiful angels\u2019 rather than something more accurate like: \u2018I tweet an awful lot at female newsreaders\u2019 or \u2018I am a racist.\u2019 More than that, there\u2019s the sense that, even after 11 months, my dad keys still haven\u2019t arrived. I\u2019m aware of the irony of me saying this here, in the weekly column I write for a national newspaper that is specifically about being a dad. But it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t love being a father, that it doesn\u2019t so often consume me that I can barely think of anything else. I certainly don\u2019t mean that I sometimes get halfway home from the shops and realise I\u2019ve been pushing an empty pram for half an hour. I simply mean I\u2019ve spent so much more of my life putting \u2018dads\u2019 in an altogether more impressive category than that in which I place myself. I still think of myself as \u2018a person who happens to have a son\u2019 while \u2018dads\u2019 are, by contrast, some other race of men, who have conversations about motorway renovations and lend each other drills. I don\u2019t have a shed. I\u2019ve never slapped the top of a friend\u2019s car as they\u2019ve driven away so they know how much I love them. In all these ways, I feel I have seen the true face of dad, and found myself not quite there. I doubt a card and a little present will make any difference, but it will be nice, as maybe I don\u2019t think about being a dad because it\u2019s so much bloody effort actually being a dad, and only when at rest will I take stock. At the risk of breaking through my ego-protecting layer of self-deprecation, I don\u2019t really care as I\u2019m still chuffed to even be thought of as a dad at all, and my son\u2019s dad particularly. If keeping at it means I eventually find some cardigan-clad corner of my own soul, a sacred spot to build model aeroplanes, a nested refuge where I can internalise my dadness, once and for all, then all the better. I just won\u2019t be putting it in my Twitter bio when I do. Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
