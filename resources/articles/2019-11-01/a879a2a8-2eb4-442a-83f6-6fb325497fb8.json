Do not read on unless you have watched season seven, episodes 11 and 12. Network issues If Spiral teaches us nothing else, it is that the ends always justify the means. Whatever Keystone Cop calamity you cause, however many heads you crack or misconduct charges you dodge, it\u2019s all good if you catch the bad guy, and that they do. Naturally, there are some repercussions for all the fast ones pulled \u2013 we\u2019ll get to that. It all begins with Laure and Gilou facing awkward questions from internal affairs about the missing \u20ac500,000. Sterling work from Ali clears the immediate danger and the dogged Tintin leans on the mobile phone shop owner to keep his yap shut. It is masterful witness tampering. It should be \u2013 he learned from the best. It is Roban, however, who is this week\u2019s MVP, pressuring the prefect with his incriminating email. That greenlights the crucial Aubervilliers raids where the money sniffing hounds have a field day, rooting out \u20ac2m of undeclared cash. After that, the whole house of cards starts tumbling and the network is doomed. David Cann\u2019s been pretty smug so far, but that all changes. The DNA on the cigarette linking his driver Vadim Sokolov to the Herville crime scene proves, once again, that smoking is bad for you. It implicates Cann decisively and even Edelman counsels surrender. His plan to ferret his way out of the country on a private plane falls through when the cops tap Nadia\u2019s phone and he is finally apprehended at his club. When Ali kills Vadim, it\u2019s one less guy for David to throw under the bus and, once Oury flips on him, he is left pondering exactly how well-disposed French courts are to money-laundering cop killers. Laure We all know what Laure\u2019s lost this year, but let\u2019s look at what she\u2019s gained. There\u2019s the knowledge that parenting really isn\u2019t her bag. Then there\u2019s the self-respect that chasing and catching bad guys gives her. Most of all, there\u2019s Gilou \u2013 her partner in crime, lover and, ultimately, her saviour. Of course, he takes the fall for her, because Berthaud has got that bit more to lose. We finish on her approaching Br\u00e9mont playing with Romy \u2013 could there be a role for her to play in her daughter\u2019s life after all? Gilou It looked like Gilou was done for last season after the theft of the gold ingots, but \u2013 as so often before \u2013 he Houdinied his way out. Even a cool cat like him runs out of lives eventually and you sense a relief in him when he falls on his sword for Laure. Thuggery redeemed by gallantry was always his thing, and he signs a full confession exonerating her. It was Soizic\u2019s testimony that did for him, and few could blame her after the way she was treated. A good defence brief will argue that Escoffier suffered a rare loss of judgment in desperation to find his boss\u2019s killer. I wonder if Jos\u00e9phine\u2019s free? Jos\u00e9phine She may be free, but available? The jury is out on that one after a traumatic year leaves her exhausted. She honours her promise to keep Lola\u2019s rape out of the trial, only for Lola herself to speak out. When the suspended sentence comes down and Lola can walk due to time served, it is so much more than just another mark in the win column. Much of this season has been dealing with the trauma of the last and with Lola out, they can now walk into the sunset together. Ms Karlsson doesn\u2019t seem like the retiring kind though. One way or another, you have to believe she\u2019ll be back. Roban It was looking a bit hairy for a while there as Fran\u00e7ois faced ending his career in disgrace and, worse, with an unresolved case. A bit of light blackmail on the prefect works wonders, however, ensuring the Aubervilliers raids that ultimately close the case. Like all the Spiral principals, Roban falls very much into the live-to-work camp so retirement will present a unique challenge. If he still has Dr Micaleff\u2019s number, she could have a prescription for that. The first order of business , however, will be that beer with Didier \u2013 he\u2019s earned that at least. Thoughts and observations When Laure insists on being interviewed by someone above her own rank, it feels like a deliberate shout out to Line of Duty. Is there scope for an Anglo-French collaboration like The Tunnel? I know we like to ride CID for their blunders, but how bad a decision was it by internal affairs boss Anfray to include Tintin in the investigation into his old buddies? He\u2019s practically a co-conspirator, and is more devastated than Gilou when they finally get their guy. How interesting that when Edelman refuses to rat out David Cann, it is Jos\u00e9phine who comes to his rescue by trying to make the deal with Roban, then leading the cops to Cann\u2019s club. She respects Edelman sticking to the street code, even if she doesn\u2019t feel bound by it herself. \u201cTry not to worry too much. Guilt is a bastard.\u201d Rayan may have got his brother killed but Gilou, who\u2019s caused a few deaths himself, lets him know that he\u2019s there for him. Thanks once again for your excellent comments this year. Auroreborealis\u2019 posts on translation were particular eye-openers. Filming has just wrapped on Spiral season eight, so with a bit of luck we\u2019ll pick this up again next year. \u00c0 plus!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
