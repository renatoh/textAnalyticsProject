The potential Lions Test No10 has been the subject of a lucrative offer from Racing M\u00e9tro but his Leinster coach, Joe Schmidt, believes the speculation will be put to bed in the coming days. While Sexton was as influential as ever in Leinster's stirring, if ultimately futile, 20-29 win in Devon on a cold Saturday night, Schmidt feels the 27-year-old will be putting himself under extreme pressure if he kicks off the Six Nations Championship with the issue still undecided. \"It would be great for Jonny if it got sorted out in the next week. I just don't think he needs it heading into the Six Nations. I really hope that one way or the other \u2013 one way, to be honest \u2013 it is sorted. Hopefully it'll play out in the next week or so.\" There was cautious optimism at the weekend that Sexton will remain in Ireland; if that proves the case, it will reward the smooth talkers of the Irish Rugby Football Union. \"It's an IRFU issue and I've got to say they're doing their darnedest to wind it up,\" confirmed Schmidt. \"We'd love to hold on to him and Ireland would love him to stay in the country as well but I also know Jonny's in demand. There will always be big offers for quality players like him. He works very hard, he's skilful and he runs a good game\u2026 he's a super player and a super kid.\" Sexton, either way, will now be just a spectator when the knock-out stages of this season's Heineken Cup commence, following Munster's bonus-point victory over Racing M\u00e9tro. Schmidt was already resigned to that scenario but did take a parting swipe at the structure of a tournament that contrived to pair last season's two outstanding sides in the same pool. \"There are regrets and frustrations but there's no point wasting too much time on what I can't affect,\" said Schmidt. \"We've had a fantastic run, winning three out of the last four titles. Now we'll just have to try to win it next year. I do know these guys love playing together and they'll enjoy next year with as many still together as possible. I enjoy their work ethic and the way they try to express themselves on the field. We've been imperfect but we haven't lacked for effort.\" The deposed champions, who must now concentrate on reaching the Amlin Challenge Cup final in Dublin, certainly had to dig deep to beat the courageous Chiefs, who emerged from their first season of European rugby with massive credit. They led both Clermont and Leinster at half-time, defeated the Scarlets home and away and came within an inch or two of a draw in Dublin on the opening pool weekend. Even after Leinster had secured a fourth try the outcome was still not entirely settled and the French referee Romain Poite did the home team few favours. The only negative was a twisted medial ligament suffered by their England squad flanker Tom Johnson, who left on a stretcher. He is unlikely to be available for England's opening two Six Nations fixtures against Scotland and Ireland.
