Albuquerque police said Jones had also been speeding at the time but the fighter said his actions had been misinterpreted and he was merely greeting fans. \u201cI was not drag racing nor was I speeding. I did not get a speeding ticket. I was driving within the speed limit of the 35mph zone,\u201d Jones said in a statement. \u201cI feel that police used a technicality to ticket me for drag racing, for simply revving my engine and acknowledging some of my local fans. I regrettably said words to the police officer out of frustration, for which I apologize for, but I do feel this was excessive.\u201d In an video obtained by TMZ, Jones is captured calling the police officer who pulled him over \u201can absolute fucking liar\u201d. \u201cFor the police to be correct, the judge is going to have to find that Jon revving his engine constitutes drag racing,\u201d Jones\u2019s attorney, Vincent Ward, said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t speeding, he was not driving recklessly. All Jon did was rev his engine to acknowledge a fan.\u201d The incident is not the first driving offence Jones has been involved in. He was given a 90 day suspended sentence earlier this month for driving without a license, registration or proof of insurance. He was also charged with leaving the scene of an accident in April 2015 in which a pregnant woman was left with a broken arm. He was placed on probation and stripped of his UFC title over the incident. Jones is due to fight light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier in Las Vegas on April 23 in Las Vegas. \u201cWe are aware of the situation and are looking into the matter,\u201d the UFC said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve also been in touch with Jon\u2019s team regarding the matter.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
