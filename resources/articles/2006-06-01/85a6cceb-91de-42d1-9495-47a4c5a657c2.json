They're allowing themselves half an hour to travel about two miles. If the Queen has a bike, I imagine that's the kind of pace she likes to keep. Emily Thornberry is the leader of the all-party parliamentary cycling group. Derek Twigg is the minister for rail and cycling. Stephen Jordan is the managing director of London and Continental Stations and Property. If there's any truth at all to this undertaking, Jordan will eject the MPs from St Pancras for inconveniencing his passengers, and politely ask that they come back with their vehicles between the hours of 4.45 and hell am. That won't happen, however. It will be all smiles, and none of them will fall off. This kind of cycling is a novelty turn, like wearing a red nose and having your prostate checked on the local news for Men's Downstairs Health Week. The rest of the year, conversely, cycling is the most intensely political transport system in the world of wheels. There are, in parliament, one or two genuine cyclists. Boris Johnson doesn't do it to teach us a lesson in how to live; he does it because he likes to feel the wind in his posh hair. Generally, though, the principal purpose is peddling a set of ideas rather than pedalling. Of course I don't need to spell this out, but fashion for yourself an image using these key words and phrases: green; sustainable; wholesome; ruddy; cheeky; fun; family man/lady; safety first; our planet is for our children; oops; after you, copper; ah, Bisto; help, I'm having an Englishness overdose, get me some garlic! These David Cameron bikers are very bad ambassadors for the business of cycling, since they're too desperate to fillet out all the aces of the sport, and leave behind the dark side - the kamikaze, eco-warrior maniac with fixed gears who swears at children and has black elbows from dipping them in fumes. Furthermore, these politico-bikers are not actually interested in the business of getting anywhere; they're using the bikes like sandwich boards, rather than vehicles. In other words, you're looking at a motorist in cyclist's clothing. (Though not literally - that really would be a bridge too far. He likes the Smiths, and he wears Lycra shorts!) Such people end up sanctioning measures that are detrimental to cyclists: mandatory use of very badly maintained cycle lanes, for instance; or being followed by a people carrier with your clean clothes in it, which, apart from anything else, must be incredibly confusing for a cyclist behind you, unless of course they've noticed that you're David Cameron. Meanwhile, you have the vast majority of MPs, who don't cycle but have to find a way to love it publicly without actually doing it. This makes them resentful, and you can hardly blame them - it's the great taboo of politics; an old-guard Tory could probably get away with it, but for anyone else, admitting that you hate cyclists is four notches worse than being a heavy smoker/obese, probably only one or two below open racism or sexism. Hating cyclists is the new New Labour equivalent of having a beard. From this unsayable ill will, the hate that dare not speak its name, springs the most noxious policy-making: to choose at random, the London mayor seems to spend half his budget urging people to get on their bikes, and the other half devising new and innovative ways of killing them when they do. How else do you explain the bendy bus? Ultimately, even though cycling is green, and gives you an environmento-thrill, it would be better for cyclists if it were depoliticised, turned into a kooky, special-interest business like micro-scootering or inline skating. Yes, you'd get even more - or at least more open - enmity from motorists, but better a motorist enemy than a politician friend. zoe_williams@ntlworld.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
