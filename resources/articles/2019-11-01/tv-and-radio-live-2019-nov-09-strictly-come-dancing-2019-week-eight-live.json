Next week it\u2019s the BLACKPOOL special \u2013 kick off is at 7.05pm, so don\u2019t be late for the Glitterbus; I\u2019ve thoroughly steam cleaned it after last year, and will bring a selection of finger sandwiches. In the meantime you can find me Twitter @heidistephens \u2013 thanks for coming, and have a good week! Hx Mike has been on a transformative Strictly journey, and his mum has even started Zumba. It\u2019s a heartfelt goodbye from both of them, then they take to the floor to Take That\u2019s \u2018Rule The World\u2019. Mike gets his head jammed in Katya\u2019s crotch, and now they\u2019ve started a Conga. Best farewell dance ever. All the judges vote for Michelle and Giovanni (obviously), which means MIKE AND KATYA are leaving Strictly. He\u2019s had a good run and improved enormously since the beginning, but that\u2019s absolutely the right decision. Michelle and Giovanni\u2019s American Smooth is still fabulous, despite the faffing abaaaht at the beginning and Michelle being dressed as a bottle of toilet duck. Dance off time! Mike is doing the banana dance again. It is much as it ever was. I\u2019ve still never been to Blackpool, Every year I\u2019m tempted to blag Strictly tickets and go, but that would mean missing the liveblog and the opportunity to get annoyed about superfluous backing dancers. Incidentally, I really don\u2019t get the love for Chris \u2013 he must have had a HUGE public vote score to end up ahead of Michelle and Giovanni. He\u2019s not a great dancer, nor is he particularly funny or charming; I am entirely at a loss as to his appeal. Karen, however, is entirely fierce and I love her. So who is joining Michelle and Giovanni in the dance off? I\u2019ve accepted that one of Mike or Chris will be going to Blackpool, but I may tip over the edge if it\u2019s both of them. Kelvin and Oti are safe, along with Emma and Anton and Chris and Karen! Which means MIKE AND KATYA are in the dance-off. I\u2019m not sure if there has ever been a dance off that\u2019s more of a done deal, but it\u2019s reasonable to assume that Michelle and Giovanni are safely off to Blackpool. As is traditional on Remembrance weekend, the Strictly stars are helping to sell poppies in what looks like Waterloo station. My sister is a serving member of the RAF and laid a wreath in Stamford today, whilst my dad and brother-in-law both marched as RAF veterans at the Cenotaph. Am hugely proud of all of them. Up in the Clauditorium, I am entirely in love with Shirley\u2019s dress. It\u2019s DIVINE. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of actor Luke Evans, arguably the most square-jawed human ever to cross the Severn Bridge. He\u2019s singing \u2018Bring Him Home\u2019 from Les Miserables, presumably for lols because I can\u2019t find any evidence that he\u2019s ever played Valjean other than in his own shower. Ooh this song gives me the shivers, AND we get bonus barefoot Johannes and Amy! Is Amy on some kind of retainer with the Blackpool Tourist Board? Well, did NOT see that coming. Michelle and Giovanni scored 36 last night, and were second of the leaderboard \u2013 they should absolutely not have been in the bottom two. So unless viewers decided to punish Michelle for that ghastly dress, I\u2019m guessing people assumed they were safe and voted for those in a slightly more shaky position. VOTE FOR YOUR FAVES, PEOPLE. So who is safely on the way to next week\u2019s Blackpool extravaganza? Karim and Amy are safe, along with Alex and Neil and Saffron and AJ. First couple in the bottom two: MCHELLE AND GIOVANNI! WAIT, WHAAAAT? Last night on Strictly: A bag of (mostly) delights, including a high energy Jive from Alex and Neil, a saucy housewife American Smooth from Michelle and Giovanni, and a hiptastic Salsa from Kelvin and Oti. Saffron and AJ waltzed their way to the top of the leader board, whilst Mike and Katya Paso-ed their way to the bottom. Please for the love of all things Strictly can we let them go \u2013 Mike has run his course and Katya looks like a woman on the edge. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess caught in a fishing net of blue sequins, Claudia in a rather fabulous dinner jacket. Tonight\u2019s pro dance is a Remembrance Sunday special, featuring stories of families sending their loved ones off to battle, to Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \u2018Time After Time\u2019. A hauntingly beautiful and moving tribute, I am quite undone. If you missed Countryfile Casual Weather earlier, it was presented by the delightful Nick Miller, resplendent in jeans, black belt and a burgundy plaid shirt with rolled up sleeves. Could have undone another button there Nick, but a casual effort nonetheless. Evening all, and welcome back for some Sunday night Strictly results! Hopefully you all had a love-filled, reflective and peaceful Remembrance Sunday, and have dried out after the Blackpool Bingo last night. Based on the performances and leaderboard, we should be waving goodbye to either Chris or Mike this evening \u2013 which one won\u2019t be get a seat on the Blackpool funbus? Kick off is at 7.20pm, so I\u2019ll see you then! Thanks all for joining in down below and being amazing as always \u2013 I\u2019m off to read your comments and have a retrospective sip of wine for every one of the mentions of Blackpool \u2013 was anyone keeping count? I\u2019ll be back tomorrow at 7.20pm for the results, so join me then! Enjoy the rest of your Saturday x So that\u2019s it for the dancing, and the voting is open! Saffron and AJ are at the top of the leaderboard, whilst Mike and Katya have sunk to the bottom. Lots of dances I loved this evening \u2013 loved Alex, Michelle, Saffron and Kelvin. Can\u2019t see how Mike and Chris won\u2019t be facing off in the dance off, either one of them could go home tomorrow and if I\u2019m honest I don\u2019t much care which. Scores: 8,9,9,9 \u2013 a total of 35 and a happy finish all round. Motsi loved the speed and body movement, and Shirley was impressed with the lifts, although there were a couple of timing issues. Bruno thought it was a Salsa in top gear, and Kelvin\u2019s hips were turbo charged. Craig couldn\u2019t really enjoy it because Motsi was screeching all the way through, but it was \u2018hiptastic\u2019. This has a motor racing theme, because Kelvin is an actual racing car driver. But never mind that, look at Kelvin\u2019s HIPS. They\u2019re more fluid than my nan\u2019s custard, and quite hypnotic to watch. He also has nice bounce, but between Kelvin\u2019s hip action and Oti\u2019s splits it\u2019s quite hard to take it all in. A bit scrappy in places, but I definitely want an invitation to Kelvin\u2019s lovin\u2019 one man show. And finally tonight it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! This week they\u2019re dancing the Salsa to \u2018Let\u2019s Hear It For the Boy\u2019 by Deniece Williams, one of my absolute favourite songs of the 1980s. However I can strongly recommend not attempting to sing it at karaoke; it\u2019s surprisingly high and just gets higher, until only dogs can hear you. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Saffron and AJ. So much screaming. Craig calls AJ a clever cherub \u2013 that was absolutely gawjus. Motsi thought it was the best dance she\u2019s seen on her first Strictly. Shirley thought they made it look easy, whilst Bruno was swept away \u2013 it was a dance of the highest quality. Four tens, anyone? Saffron appears to have embraced the poppy theme with gusto, although on a flesh-coloured dress it looks a bit like a nasty rash. This is, however, rather a charming Waltz, with nice flow and lovely rise and fall from Saffron. Her frame goes a bit awry towards the end, but generally quite lovely \u2013 easily my favourite dance of theirs. Who\u2019s next? It\u2019s SAFFRON AND AJ! This week they\u2019re dancing the Waltz to another insipid cover \u2013 this time Ellie Goulding\u2019s John Lewis version of Elton John\u2019s \u2018Your Song\u2019. I really want to love this partnership more, but I find myself unmoved. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re both lovely people, but there\u2019s no chemistry for me \u2013 it\u2019s like watching two plastic dolls bumping into one another. I need more of a connection and a bit more fire. Scores: 8,9,8,8 \u2013 a total of 33 for Emma and Anton. Bruno loved all the Fosse references, Emma was in her element although there were a couple of occasions when they weren\u2019t mirrored. Craig thought it was understated and stylised \u2013 very much Emma\u2019s dance. Motsi loved it too, and Shirley loved the use of music and the details \u2013 one of Emma\u2019s better dances. Is there some law that states all Jazz dances have to be done in a bowler hat? A few balance issues at the beginning, but some nice footwork from Emma and some good hat action. I don\u2019t really get this type of dancing, not really my cup of tea - also why does this song sound like the theme to the Flintstones? Next up it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON! It\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice week for them, and they\u2019ve chosen a Theatre/Jazz routine to \u2018Right Now\u2019 by The Pussycat Dolls. Since Faye and Giovanni\u2019s Theatre/Jazz CC was one of the most memorable dances of last year, this is hugely risky. But if we consider the alternative of Anton doing street dance or interpretive contempo-waft, it\u2019s probably for the best. Scores: 9,9,9,9 \u2013 a total of 36 for Michelle and Giovanni. Shirley thought it was sophisticated and sassy \u2013 naughty and nice from Michelle. Bruno loved the flawless storytelling, and the little touches Michelle gave to the character. Craig thought Michelle was the mistress of detail, he loved it. Motsi always buys what Michelle is selling \u2013 they use technique in the right way so she can really feel the dancing. So Michelle is a housewife trying to please her man, but Giovanni is having none of it. Changing that ghastly dress might be a good start. I love the storytelling of this American Smooth, it\u2019s a lovely build of attitude to the finish and Michelle is an absolute queen. LOVED that. It\u2019s time for MICHELLE AND GIOVANNI! This week they\u2019re dancing the American Smooth to \u2018I Just Want To Make Love To You\u2019 by Etta James. Alison Hammond and Aljaz danced the Foxtrot to this back in 2014, but I\u2019m very much hoping that Michelle will turn the sass dial up to 11 and Giovanni will give us full Diet Coke Break realness. Scores: 5,7,7,7 \u2013 a total of 26 for Chris and Karen. Motsi loved serious Chris, but the footwork could have been cleaner. Shirley enjoyed the focus and how he led the dance, and the footwork was fairly decent. Bruno appreciated the purpose, the intent and the content, but he looked like he was walking it in places. Craig thinks Chris seriously needs to up his game to stay in the competition, it was technically lacking. Oooh, flames! Chris has a great Tango face, but from the neck down this lacks drive and precision. Mostly this a lot of wandering about, with pigeon toes in hold. A nice effort, but less of a Tango and more of a grumpy stroll. Next up it\u2019s CHRIS AND KAREN! This week they\u2019re dancing the Tango to \u2018Survivor\u2019 by 2wei, the inspired cover of the Destiny\u2019s Child anthem. Sorry, \u2018inspired\u2019 was a typo, I meant \u2018insipid\u2019. Chris is definitely a survivor, and yet I have no idea why or how. Scores: 6,8,8,8 \u2013 a total of 30 for Karim and Amy. \u2018I don\u2019t know how I got that\u2019, says Karim. Neither do I, Karim, neither do I. Craig points out that there were two large mistakes and too much rise and fall, and Motsi wants Karim to overcome his nerves and gain more focus. Shirley thought it lost some of the quality in hold, but it was disappointing for Karim. Bruno liked the sense of stormy romance, if Karim had managed to get it right it would have been fantastic. Ooh, they\u2019re up a lighthouse! This is a pretty Viennese from Karim , although Amy\u2019s chiffon wings are rather distracting and it all feels a bit tangly. Too much rise and fall and not Karim\u2019s best dance, but charming nonetheless. It\u2019s time for KARIM AND AMY! This week they\u2019re dancing the Viennese Waltz to \u2018Give Me Love\u2019 by Ed Sheeran. Their Quickstep last week earned them three tens, so they\u2019ve got a lot to live up to this week. But Karim is the precision dancer in this year\u2019s competition, I don\u2019t suppose a Viennese is going to give him any trouble. Scores: 5,7,7,6 \u2013 a total of 25 for Mike and Katya. Bruno appreciated the effort, but it needed more power and was too heavy and rigid. Craig thought the shaping at the beginning showed promise but it had no flow. Motsi liked the focus and the characterisation, it was without a doubt a great Paso. Shirley was impressed by Mike\u2019s solo start and he led the dance well \u2013 a good effort despite the lack of flow. Mike opens with a nice bit of stompy flamenco, and if you ignore his free arm this absolutely isn\u2019t the worst Paso we\u2019ve ever seen. However his Spanish line isn\u2019t quite happening, and mostly Katya is using him as a pole to dance around. Also not sure about the weird knee balance finish. Next up tonight (slot of death, Mike\u2019s time is up) it\u2019s MIKE AND KATYA! This week they\u2019re dancing the Paso Doble to \u2018Tamacun\u2019 by Rodrigo y Gabriela. This is a proper Paso tune, for what I\u2019m guessing will be anything but a proper Paso. Reading this week\u2019s Terms &amp; Conditions \u2013 Clara Amfo off of Radio 1. I love her, and that catsuit is incredible. Scores: 7,8,8,8 \u2013 a total of 31 for Alex and Neil. Shirley thought Alex did very well, she was light on her feet and looked like she was having the time of her life. Bruno thought it was bright, lively and sunny \u2013 Alex is growing in confidence and her timing was great, but her leg retractions need to be a bit sharper. Craig thought Alex\u2019s balance was slightly off and needed more attack in the kicks and flicks, but she was working it. Motsi thought they looked like a couple who have got new life in their relationship after one of them had an affair. TOO SOON. Neil appears to be dressed as your grandad, whilst Alex has been line dancing in custard. Loving the energy of this Jive, and great to see Alex in her absolute element \u2013 she\u2019s got the stamina and her personality is shining through. The footwork is a bit soft in places but definitely one of my favourite Jives this year. First up tonight it\u2019s ALEX AND NEIL! This week they\u2019re dancing the Jive to \u2018Let\u2019s Twist Again\u2019 by Chubby Checker. More than happy to hear the original version of this, rather than the Jive Bunny butchered version. Good to see Neil back on the dancefloor this evening, I think it was a bit touch and go whether he\u2019d be dancing this week. Thanks for everything Kevin, but your Grimsby harbour jigsaw isn\u2019t going to finish itself. Meanwhile the stars descend the Strictly stairway \u2013 some absolute frock horrors this week, Michelle looks like a pine fresh magic tree. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in one-shouldered gold foil (including a random tail), and Claudia in a black pearly halterneck. Thanks for the drinking game nod, Clauds. Chin chin to you too. And we\u2019re off! First Blackpool mention! DRINK! Last week on Strictly we waved goodbye to society zookeeper Emma Weymouth and the lovely Aljaz. This week, the pressure is on, because they all want to go to Blackpool. Three or four Blackpool mentions there. Get stuck in, people. This week\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo is a ONE WORD SPECIAL, as is traditional in Week 8 - take a sip of your favourite tipple for any mention of BLACKPOOL. Only very small sips, mind; the NHS is already in crisis and I don\u2019t wish to add to their burden. Evening all, and welcome back for another spin around the Strictly dancefloor! It\u2019s the pre-Blackpool warm-up week, where seats on the Glitterbus are being allocated on a strictly first-come first-served basis. With only eight couples left, things are starting to heat up a bit down in Heidi\u2019s Hunches. Chris and Karen and Mike and Katya are very much the weakest remaining links, and history tells us that they\u2019ll both probably go over the next two weeks now they\u2019re both running out of personality-driven dances and the judges have no choice but to judge their actual technique. I\u2019d put Emma and Anton in the danger zone too, but they\u2019re playing their Couple\u2019s Choice joker this evening, which seems to guarantee you nines even if you just rock up and do the Macarena in your underwear. Group 1: one eye on the final \u2013 Kelvin and Oti, Michelle and Giovanni, Karim and Amy Group 2: hot on their heel leads \u2013 Alex and Neil, Saffron and AJ Group 3: couple\u2019s choice free pass \u2013 Emma B and Anton Group 4: dodging the dance-off \u2013 Mike and Katya, Chris and Karen Kick off is at 6.50pm, so get ready to sprinkle a little joy and sparkle in the comment box below. See you then!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
