The comments were made in reply to deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce\u2019s suggestion that people wanting to buy a home look further afield in response to reports that Sydney is now the second least affordable housing market in the world. Speaking to Radio National on Wednesday, Berejiklian touted her government\u2019s efforts to keep prices under control, emphasising supply as the most important factor in house prices and refusing to be drawn on whether the federal government should restrict negative gearing tax deductions to restrain demand. On Wednesday Joyce said: \u201cI get annoyed when people talk about that the only house apparently that you can buy is in Sydney and it\u2019s too dear.\u201d Joyce rattled off markets where houses were cheaper, including Tamworth, Armidale and Toowoomba. \u201cWe believe that houses will always be incredibly expensive if you can see the Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge, just accept that,\u201d he said. \u201cI did move out west so I can say this, if you\u2019ve got the gumption in you and you decide to move to Charleville, you\u2019re going to have a very affordable house.\u201d Asked about Joyce\u2019s comments, Berejiklian said simply that \u201ca good society gives people choices\u201d, which is why she had nominated housing affordability as one of her top three issues for her government. \u201cThe average person that lives in Sydney, if they want to buy a house in Sydney, that shouldn\u2019t be out of reach for them,\u201d she said. Berejiklian said that housing affordability was \u201ctop of the mind for the prime minister\u201d and the state looked forward to working with the federal government. Asked about whether the federal government should restrict or axe negative gearing tax concessions, Berejiklian said her \u201cinitial focus\u201d would be on what New South Wales could do. \u201cI don\u2019t feel [negative gearing] is something I would necessarily touch in relation to housing affordability.\u201d Berejiklian\u2019s comments contrast with her former leadership rival, the housing minister, Rob Stokes, who strongly criticised negative gearing. In November Stokes argued that it did nothing to improve supply but advantaged investors who reduced their taxable income at the expense of other Australians. Berejiklian said the biggest factor for housing affordability was lack of supply. When questioned about the large increases in housing approvals and developments that had not dented prices, the new premier said prices would have increased even more if not for that extension of supply. Berejiklian said the government was \u201cvery active\u201d in making investments in social and affordable housing. According to reports, the state has developed a policy that will require new housing developments on rezoned land to dedicate 5% to 10% of the extra floor space for low-income homes, which will be managed by community housing providers. She said it would consider options to allow people with \u201cessential jobs\u201d to live near where they work, citing bus drivers in her northern Sydney seat of Willoughby who came from the the central coast to work. On Wednesday the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said Joyce\u2019s comments on housing affordability show how out of touch he and the government are. He said country life \u201csuits many people\u201d but \u201cis not an option for everyone\u201d and the suggestion was unrealistic because of high unemployment in Joyce\u2019s electorate. Bowen said the government should develop a housing affordability policy \u201cinstead of lecturing people, telling people to get a better job or get rich parents or move to Charleville\u201d. \u201cIt should deal with negative gearing. The treasurer is in the UK looking at options for housing affordability. Good on him. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he look at what the Cameron conservative government did, which was to reform the tax concessions for property investment?\u201d The federal treasurer, Scott Morrison, recognised housing affordability as a problem in a major speech in October but has so far only canvassed supply-side policies including encouraging states to release more land. Last week the new assistant minister to the treasurer, Michael Sukkar, whose responsibilities include housing affordability, did not rule out a proposal to make owner-occupiers\u2019 home mortgages tax deductible, which housing economists warned was expensive and ineffective."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
