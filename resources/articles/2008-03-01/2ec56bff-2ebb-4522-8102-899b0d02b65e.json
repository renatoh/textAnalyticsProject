Among the titles the company published were Rachel \"North\"'s misery memoir Out of the Tunnel and Blood, Sweat and Tea by ambulance worker Tom Reynolds. According to my sources, The Friday Project has always operated a fairly predatory approach to the web; offering most of their writers fairly desultory rewards for their work, especially compared to the deals offered some other bloggers). Still, any penny pinching didn't appear to help the bottom line much... the company's accounts look rough, with losses of \u00a3705,713 last year. What next? Well, the Telegraph says Harper Collins - a book publishing arm of Darth Murdoch's NewsCorp Death Star - is buying the company. But what becomes of the bloggers and their books? Not clear - directors Scott Pack and Clare Christian both say they can't comment on the situation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
