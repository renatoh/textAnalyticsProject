There seemed an uncanny symmetry with the spring of 2009 when Alan Shearer appeared on the same touchline and exhibited similarly disbelieving, exasperated and frustrated body language. Just like his former Blackburn Rovers title-winning team-mate before him, Sherwood did not merely look appalled at much of what was unfolding in front of him but treated anyone within earshot to an expletive-laden commentary. Six years ago Shearer took charge of Newcastle United in the hope of averting relegation but failed, with a 1-0 defeat at Villa Park sealing the club\u2019s plunge into the Championship. Now Aston Villa are the team in trouble and Sherwood the man tasked with ensuring Premier League survival. If the experience of managing Tottenham Hotspur makes him infinitely better qualified for the post than Shearer was when he took over at St James\u2019 Park, the sheer scale of the task ahead appears worryingly comparable. If it seemed incredible that a Newcastle side including Michael Owen and Mark Viduka could go down, it is almost equally puzzling to find a Villa first XI featuring Christian Benteke, Gabriel Agbonlahor, Fabian Delph and Ashley Westwood languishing in the bottom three. Sherwood was certainly not fooled by the reality that Villa might easily have drawn with or even beaten a very ordinary Newcastle side badly missing the suspended Jack Colback in central midfield. The knowledge that they did not really deserve to lose will provide little insulation during much tougher afternoons ahead. \u201cIf you look through the whole squad no one is really playing to their maximum,\u201d Villa\u2019s manager said. \u201cWe need to use our brains and our quality. Now\u2019s the time to start showing that quality because there isn\u2019t a problem with heart and character in that dressing room. I see a lot of desire and heart and running around \u2013 but we need more quality.\u201d Much surely depends on Benteke and Westwood, Villa\u2019s two best players here. \u201cAshley\u2019s a very good technician,\u201d said Sherwood. \u201cHe just needs to dictate games from start to finish. Christian needs a goal but I thought he was good.\u201d Paul Lambert\u2019s successor is anxious for his squad to embrace the tension that comes with their position. \u201cI\u2019m putting the pressure on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s reverse psychology but we have to take something from every game. \u201cWe need six wins. We have 11 games left and, as players, they need to start taking responsibility. Now is the time for points. We need a siege mentality.\u201d How Sherwood could do with a Papiss Ciss\u00e9. Despite an ongoing knee problem stemming from screws inserted during surgery 11 months ago, Ciss\u00e9 remains the Premier League\u2019s most clinicial striker, averaging a goal every 84 minutes. Facilitated by Daryl Janmaat\u2019s cross, his 11th goal of the season was a typically ruthless close-range shot. \u201cWe\u2019re having to manage Papiss\u2019s knee, deal with his situation,\u201d said John Carver, Newcastle\u2019s head coach, who had equally impressive performances from Janmaat, Fabricio Coloccini and Tim Krul to thank for victory. \u201cBut if he keeps getting in the right place he might be able to play with just one leg.\u201d Man of the match Daryl Janmaat (Newcastle United)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
