Now I for one am not sure that poor viewing figures for the new ITV Premiership programme are just about scheduling. Is this the first signs of alienation from much of what is represented by the Premiership; exorbitant wages for players, too much corporate influence; and exclusion by high prices? Let's hope so, as the fact is the game is much bigger than the Premiership but it is being undermined and possibly ruined by it. The massive gap between the Premiership and the Nationwide is now spreading to the Premiership itself, effectively those who will prosper, those who will be OK and around 10 clubs for whom survival is the only objective. What faced Wednesday following relegation will face others, but even harder, as they become increasingly reliant on TV income and as the so-called \"new\" fans attracted by the lure of big names drift away when only struggle is in prospect; witness Boro who cannot now sell all their season tickets. Coventry are in even more dire financial trouble than Wednesday. The merger theory is all based on the economic grounds that to survive in the Premiership both Sheffield clubs would need to merge; now I think the concept is a non-starter in the first place because fans don't want it, but where is the evidence that the theory will prove to be successful in practice? What happens if it is just survival and there isn't the fan loyalty to sustain it? Meanwhile, the players union (PFA) is campaigning for a bigger share of the Premiership TV cake, presenting this as re-distribution of wealth. Their argument that not all players are millionaires and that ex-players often need help to pay for operations to deal with injuries etc have some validity. They also argue that they have helped support clubs in financial crisis by paying wage bills until they get on a more even keel, this is true. However, they do not make reference to the fact that players only have to pay \u00a375 per year in PFA membership, even the Premiership millionaires. Now think about your own union subs as a percentage of your wages; I suspect it is greater than \u00a375 is of Beckham's. Secondly they don't tell you that their Chief Executive, Graham Taylor, in his role as President of the international players body (Fifpro) has been negotiating to undermine a recent deal on transfer fees made between Uefa and the EU. This deal would have guaranteed transfer income to clubs who lose young players they have brought through their academy systems, because of freedom of contract. If players really do care about looking after their fellow professionals why not contribute more themselves to collective insurance funds? If players do care about other players why are they doing something to damage small clubs and which will only result in them not investing in youth development? Because they are looking after themselves in a very short-sighted way and forgetting the wider interests of the game, that's why. Now I do recognise that players used to be badly treated by football clubs and that the balance of power needed restoring, but I think it has now gone too far. For example if most people are not able to do their jobs as a result of injury or illness the employer is eventually to do something about it; in football they just continue to get paid despite the effect it has on the business - look at Wednesday! The football authorities have to do something to save the game, if they won't, then Governments should because football is more that just money and it means more than money to fans. I think three things have to be achieved: a) The balance between players and clubs has to be re-stored ; b) The gap between the Premiership and the rest has to bridged ; and c) Fans and communities have to be re-engaged with their clubs, and not just at times of crisis. How could these things be achieved? Well I put forward the following: 1. A wages cap and a transfer Window The wages cap would apply to clubs; it would be a limit on the total players wages bill, not a cap on individuals. Clubs and players would be free to negotiate; however, they would do so within a disciplined climate. It would need to be properly audited to be effective but it could be real deterrent to the wages lunacy we have now and it would help to even up the game. The NFL uses the system in America for exactly these reasons. A transfer window system where transfers could only take place in the close season, and in a mid-season window, would make players and clubs plan for longer periods as well as avoiding the de-stabilising effects that some transfers can have on clubs. 2 A levy of Premiership TV money and tax concessions to support academies at lower league clubs The proceeds of a levy could be managed by the FA and specifically used to help smaller clubs produce quality players they can sell to fund their own finances and help reduce the reliance on foreign players of questionable quality. Concessions on VAT could be used to help smaller clubs who operate Academies of a particular size and standard to be determined by the FA. 3 Tax concessions to encourage supporter trusts, fan directors and investment in academies Why don't the Government offer VAT concession to clubs who support the establishment of Supporter Trusts and who allow the Trust to nominate a fan to sit on the Club Board? It could be possible to allow Trusts to have charitable status and allow individuals/companies to make charitable donations into Trusts for the specific purpose of enabling investment in Academies and Community Partnership activity. Now there will be people who will think it's pie in the sky and it will never happen. Well it won't unless we do something about it. Football clubs are an historic part of local communities and the Premiership gravy train must not be allowed to destroy them. The fans and the communities will still be there when the high paid stars are long gone, we need to do something to ensure the survival of local clubs. We can raise these points and arguments wherever we go, make them on radio programmes, speak/write to MP's and don't watch Premiership football - that's a language they understand! And you never know the PFA might see the sense in it - now that would be players strike really worth supporting!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
