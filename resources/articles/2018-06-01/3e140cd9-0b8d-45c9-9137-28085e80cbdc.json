The \u201cmushroom custard\u201d on top hides the juicy chicken filling beneath. You could serve it hot, but I prefer it at room temperature, and it\u2019s just as good served the next day. Serve with either a green salad or steamed veggies. Creamy chicken, mushroom and parsnip pie serves 6-8 250g short crust pastry (see below) 1 onion, peeled and thinly sliced 4 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced 50g butter (or 2 tbsp olive oil) 2 parsnips, peeled, cores removed if woody, then roughly cut into 1cm dice 500 g chicken mince 200ml water flaky salt and freshly ground black pepper 400g open-capped mushrooms (portobello mushrooms look best) 3 eggs 200ml cream 2 tbsp snipped chives Preheat oven to 180C. Roll pastry out roughly to a 32cm disc, 5mm thick. Line a 24cm diameter tart tin with the pastry and place in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up. Line the pastry with baking paper, three-quarters fill with baking beans or rice and blind bake for 15 minutes. Cool for a few minutes, then remove the paper and beans. Reduce the oven temperature to 170C. While the pastry is cooking, make the filling. Saute the onion and garlic in the butter or oil until the onion begins to caramelise, stirring occasionally. Stir in the parsnip and cook a few minutes more. Stir in the mince, breaking it up as it cooks, until lightly coloured. Add the water, 1 tsp flaky salt and plenty of pepper and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to a rapid simmer and cook until the liquid has almost evaporated, stirring frequently. Slice the mushrooms 5mm thick and reserve the 15 best slices. Once the liquid has evaporated from the chicken, stir in the mushrooms. Beat 2 eggs with the cream and season with \u00bd tsp flaky salt. Mix half of this into the chicken, along with the third egg, and spoon into the pastry case, pressing it flat. Gently pour the remaining creamy mixture on top and scatter with the reserved sliced mushrooms and the chives. Bake until the custard has set, 25\u201330 minutes. Take from the oven and leave to cool in the tin. Quick food-processor short crust pastry makes 300g 180g flour 1 pinch salt 90g chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1cm chunks 1 large egg yolk 3 tsp cold water 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil Place the flour and salt in a food processor and blitz for 5 seconds. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles breadcrumbs. Beat the egg yolk with cold water and add to the processor with the oil. Pulse until it just holds together. Tip on to a bench and gently knead until it forms a dough, being careful not to overwork it as it will toughen. Wrap in plastic wrap and place in the fridge until needed.
