An email statement from the Berlin chancellery, sent out shortly after polls closed in Greece and which mirrored one sent out by the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, said the aim of the meeting, arranged after a telephone call between the two leaders, was to \u201cjointly assess the situation after the Greek referendum and to address the continuation of Franco-German close cooperation in this matter.\u201d A government spokesman in Berlin stressed that both politicians were in agreement that \u201cthe vote of the Greek citizens is to be respected\u201d. As politicians, bankers, business leaders and policymakers across Europe held emergency meetings on Sunday night to help shape their responses to the historic referendum result, and to an impending eurozone crisis amid the growing realisation that a Greek exit from the euro cannot be ruled out, Hollande and Merkel will be expected to show a united front. They are due to speak publicly on the issue on Monday. The European Central Bank\u2019s governing council is also due to meet on Monday, with pressure on them to decide what to do about Greek lenders who depend on its emergency flow of credit. The responses came as Germans reacted with a mix of anger, puzzlement and solidarity to the Greek people\u2019s overwhelming no vote. Sigmar Gabriel, Germany\u2019s deputy chancellor and who is also the country\u2019s economy minister as well as the head of the Social Democrats, was the first member of Merkel\u2019s coalition government to react to the vote. He said the no result meant there was \u201chardly any chance left for a compromise\u201d to be made between Brussels and Athens. The government of Alexis Tsipras had \u201ctorn down the last bridges over which Europe and Greece might have been able to move towards a compromise,\u201d he told the Berlin daily Tagesspiegel. \u201cWith the rejection of the rules of the game of the eurozone, which have been expressed with the majority of nos, it is impossible to imagine negotiations over programmes worth billions,\u201d he said. Gabriel added that the ball was now in Athens\u2019 court, and that \u201cTsipras and his government were leading the Greek people down a path of bitter sacrifice and hopelessness\u201d, accusing the Greek prime minister of having tricked his people into believing that a no would strengthen Greece\u2019s negotiating position. His fellow social democrat, Ingrid Arndt-Brauer, the chairwoman of the Bundestag\u2019s finance committee, said she had been expecting her committee to be called upon on Tuesday to begin the process of negotiating a fresh bailout package. The no vote, she said, had meant that could not happen. \u201cNobody had a wish to torture the Greeks \u2013 we are not terrorists \u2013 but to help them,\u201d Arndt-Brauer said. \u201cA yes vote would have signalled a preparedness to cooperate \u2013 at least on some reforms \u2013 for fresh help. But, right now, I see no credible basis to help Greece, none at all.\u201d Members of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), who form the more rightwing element of Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc, delivered a sharp rebuke to Tsipras\u2019s government. Its general secretary, Andreas Scheuer, dismissed its members as \u201cleftwing blackmailers and deceivers of the people, who will not manage to get anywhere with their dirty tactics\u201d. He added: \u201cKali nichta, Hellas \u2013 Good Night, Greece!\u201d. The radical far-left party, Die Linke, was the only party in the Bundestag to firmly welcome the Greek vote result, calling it a victory for democracy. \u201cThe Greeks have, for the second time, defended themselves against economic destitution,\u201d the party leader, Bernd Riexinger, said. \u201cThey have said no to further austerity, to a false medication that is only ever making them sicker.\u201d The vote, he said, had legitimised the negotiating leadership of Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party, with which Die Linke is connected. \u201cThe negotiators must now get back to the table immediately and respect the democratic will of the Greek people,\u201d he added. The head of Germany\u2019s savings bank association led the response from German businesses, telling German media that the Greek people had spoken out against the rules of a single-currency union, and should now be preparing to leave the eurozone. \u201cAs a consequence, Greece should now be exiting the euro community,\u201d Georg Fahrenschon, also a member of the CSU, said. Other German business leaders, including the head of the German exporters association, Anton B\u00f6rner, also expressed their doubts that a so-called Grexit could be prevented. \u201cIt is now unavoidable,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, initial soundings from governments across Europe indicated a mixed response to the result. While the government of Poland said it was now awaiting a Grexit, Italy said it was keen to continue negotiating. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, responded to the first exit polls by calling for an emergency meeting of his government\u2019s commission for economic matters, which is due to meet on Monday to thoroughly analyse the results of the plebiscite, he announced in Madrid on Sunday evening. Responding to the no vote, Sarah-Jayne Clifton, director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign, said: \u201cThis is a historic defeat for austerity in Europe. Despite all the scaremongering, bullying and intimidation, the people of Greece have chosen hope over fear. Now, it is time for Europe\u2019s leaders to respect democracy and take responsibility for a crisis that their banks and financial institutions helped create. \u201cGreece needs substantial debt cancellation, as even the IMF has finally acknowledged. This will require honesty from European leaders that the real purpose of the bailouts was to save European banks. And it will require the type of leadership we saw from their counterparts in 1953 when they cancelled half of Germany\u2019s debt. Justice, and democracy, demand nothing less.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
