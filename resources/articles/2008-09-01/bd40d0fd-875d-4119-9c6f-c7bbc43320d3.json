For 12 180g ground almonds 300g caster sugar pinch salt 6 eggs 300g unsalted butter, softened 100g plain flour 80g cornstarch 1 heaped tsp baking powder For batter 1: a punnet of blackberries 100g ground almonds For batter 2: 150g whole shelled pistachios, roasted, unsalted and whizzed until ground for the top: three big handfuls of cherries cr\u00e8me de cassis/mure/kirsch icing sugar some rose petals if you fancy it First tear the cherries away from the stones and soak for a few hours in your chosen fruity booze. Pre-heat the oven to 160\u00baC/320\u00baF. Mix the ground almonds with the salt and sugar. Cream the butter until soft and light, beat in the eggs separately, then stir the nutty mix into it. Sift the flour, cornstarch and baking powder and very gently barely fold this into the rest of the mix. Now split the mix in two: into one stir in the squished blackberries (I did this by hand, but a fork will do) and the rest of the almonds. Into the other turn the pistachios (which must be ground but not overly so or else all their oils will come out). Have a 30cm springform cake tin buttered and lightly floured and this is the slightly tricky bit: if you imagine your round cake tin is actually square, then you want the two batters to be in opposite quadrants to each other, like looking at a slice of Battenburg cake. Then, using a spatula, make a couple of circular drags so that the batters are slightly marbled. In theory they should hold like this as they cook, but the worst that can go wrong is you get a slightly unruly split level effect, which is also pretty pleasing. Bake for about 40-45 mins, or until a skewer comes out clean, then leave to cool on a rack. Sprinkle on the cherries (and mix any left-over liquid with iced fizzy water for your cook's tipple), scatter rose petals if you fancy it and go nuts with some sifted icing sugar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
