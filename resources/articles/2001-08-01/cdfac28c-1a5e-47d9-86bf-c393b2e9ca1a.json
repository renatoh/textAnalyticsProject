The study, by Mintel, forecasts a 21% expenditure increase on gambling between 1999 and 2004. This is set to be driven by the abolition of betting tax in 2002, which will stop the 9% payment to the exchequer and horse racing industry. Instead, a 15% government levy on profits will replace betting tax. Researchers who questioned 1,901 adults as they compiled the report, entitled Betting Shops, found that nearly three quarters of those surveyed would place a bet at least once a year, with one in five betting at least once a week. The report said the betting industry had recovered from the foot-and-mouth crisis, which saw the cancellation of more than 125 meetings and a sharp drop in revenue earlier this year. Horse racing was hit by a fall of levies, but the betting industry overcame the crisis by offering punters a wider variety of wagers, Mintel said. One in four British adults has placed a bet at either a bookmaker's or a racing track in the last six months, with men twice as likely as women to frequent a bookie. The report also found that 68% of adults had bought a lottery ticket in the past six months, with the National Lottery being the most successful state-run lottery in Europe. Bingo has also enjoyed a resurgence since 1999, with admissions at clubs now exceeding the 100m mark of 1995. But only 8% of adults said they played the football pools in the last six months, with total stakes placed on the pools falling by 60% between 1993 and 1999. The study also found that betting shop punters were more likely to be in the north of England and Scotland than in the south, with 10% of Scots being frequent visitors, compared to only 4% of people in London. About half of adults placed bets of less than \u00a35, with only 5% betting more than \u00a330. Although internet betting was becoming more popular, it posed no threat to betting shops, with only about 2.5% of bets being placed online, Mintel said. One in three punters still distrusted betting over the internet, whereas one in 10 bet over the phone. But a massive 27% of adults questioned did not realise they could place bets over the internet. Spokesman Mark Brechin added: \"The recent rise in betting on football, following the temporary drop in racing coverage in spring 2001 and the prospect of the next World Cup in 2002 are both likely to reinforce the trend to visit the betting shop to bet on football.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
