Chief Jon Belmar of the St Louis County Police department said at a press conference that he \u201chonestly couldn\u2019t tell you for sure\u201d whether the person who shot one officer in the face and another in the shoulder on Wednesday night was linked to demonstrators at Ferguson\u2019s police station. Belmar told reporters that investigators had no suspects in custody for the shootings of the still-unnamed officers, who he said were \u201cremarkably well\u201d. However he said detectives were pursuing \u201cscores of tips\u201d passed on by cooperative people in the city. But the police chief appeared to concede that investigators were now less certain of the shooter\u2019s motives \u2013 and connections with protesters \u2013 than had previously been suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of really hard to speculate what kind of nexus may or may not have existed between the shooters and any individual who would have been out there,\u201d said Belmar, who had prompted strenuous denials from protesters by saying in the hours after the shootings that the gunman had somehow been \u201cembedded\u201d in a demonstration. \u201cI would have to imagine that these protesters were among the shooters that shot at the police officers,\u201d Belmar repeated at a press conference later on Thursday morning. Dozens of people had gathered at the police headquarters on Wednesday evening to celebrate the resignation of Thomas Jackson, the city\u2019s police chief, and to demand further reforms. Belmar is leading the investigation into the shooting of the police officers after his force led the local inquiry into the fatal shooting by a white police officer of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, which led to protests and unrest that spread around other US cities. In the immediate aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s shootings Belmar also appeared adamant that the officers \u2013 a 32-year-old from Webster Groves and a 41-year-old from St Louis County \u2013 were targeted because of their positions in law enforcement, which has come under sharp criticism in the region since Brown\u2019s death on 9 August. \u201cThese police officers were standing there and they were shot, just because they were police officers,\u201d Belmar said at his first press briefing. He went on to explain that the shots appeared to be aimed at the police as they were fired \u201cparallel with the ground\u201d and did not ricochet. \u201cI would have to make an assumption that these shots were directed exactly at my police officers,\u201d he said. At Friday\u2019s press conference Belmar appeared to concede that investigators did not know this for sure, and that the crowd of protesters may even have been the target. While it was \u201cnot beyond the realm of possibility\u201d that the officers were directly targeted, he said, they may in fact have been \u201cjust kind of in the way\u201d. Belmar said detectives were following leads suggested by residents. He added that a $10,000 reward fund put up by Crimestoppers had been bolstered by donations from people in the region. But he confirmed that three Ferguson residents interviewed by the Guardian on Thursday had been released without charge after they were handcuffed and taken in for questioning following a raid on their home close to the police department. However he was unapologetic for the dawn swoop, which left their home damaged, saying that such fruitless inquiries following from tip-offs were a typical part of policing. The police chief declined to be drawn on speculation over the calibre of ammunition that was used by the shooter. Detectives recovered shell casings from the area but it remained unclear whether these were relevant to the inquiry or remnants of past shootings. Jeff Roorda, a former state legislator and spokesman for the St Louis Police Officers\u2019 Association, told MSNBC on Friday morning that \u201ca 40-calibre, it appears, is what they were shot with\u201d. Such rounds can be fired by some rifles in addition to pistols. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Belmar said when asked about the equipment used. \u201cI can\u2019t say with any sort of conviction whether I have a 9mm or 22 or a 40-calibre or 45 at this point.\u201d Deflecting suggestions that the shots bore the signs of a sophisticated shooter, Belmar said the suspect was probably not a \u201cmarksman somewhere out there with a scope.\u201d However, he added, it \u201cmay turn out to be\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
