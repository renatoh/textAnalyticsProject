Four days after he was named as a potential England manager by Fabio Capello, Allardyce (with his assistant, Neil McDonald) was sacked by the Venky's Group. The manager had objected to plans to impose players on him in the January transfer window. The Indian poultry conglomerate acquired the club, for \u00a343m, from The Walker Trust 25 days ago. Its chairperson, Anuradha Desai, told a local newspaper last week that Allardyce \"deserved a chance\" and that \"the group have promised manager Allardyce funds to spend in the January transfer window\". Those funds amounted to \u00a35m, a sum Allardyce accepted, having worked without a budget surplus since he replaced Paul Ince two years ago. However, he had misgivings over the sports agency Kentaro's influence on transfer policy. The diluting of his input on transfers is believed to be behind today's events. Kentaro, which advised Venky's in the takeover process, last year agreed a corporate partnership deal with Sport Entertainment and Media Group, headed by the agent Jerome Anderson. Kentaro discussed transfer strategy with Blackburn's new owners before Allardyce did and is reported to have provided a list of potential signings that may have included the Scottish international Kris Boyd and Brazilian Geovanni. Allardyce wanted to retain complete control of transfer policy. With the owners and manager at an impasse, the club's chairman, John Williams, was instructed to dismiss the 56-year-old. A Venky's statement said: \"We have taken this decision as part of our wider plans and ambitions for the club.\" The first\u2011team coach, Steve Kean, has been placed in charge. Blackburn's next opponents, West Ham United, may move for Allardyce should they choose to replace Avram Grant. The League Managers Association condemned Rovers' decision to sack Allardyce, who was also sacked shortly after Mike Ashley's takeover of Newcastle United, in January 2008. He had enjoyed a more productive spell at Ewood Park than at St James'. Allardyce had been due at Old Trafford for last night's Manchester United game before being hit with the news. \"He phoned me at 3.10pm today saying 'can I have a cup of tea tonight?' because he was coming to the game,\" revealed Alex Ferguson. \"Then he phones me at half past four and says 'I've been sacked'. I've never heard of such a stupid decision in all my life, it's absolutely ridiculous. I don't know what they're doing up there, but deary me. \" Richard Bevan, the chief executive of the LMA, said: \"When new owners take over a club, sadly the manager's position often hangs by a thread. To Sam's great misfortune this has happened twice and on both occasions it has been extremely difficult to understand. It is ironic that one minute Sam can be proposed as the next England manager and the next he finds himself out of work.\" Allardyce, who led Blackburn to 15thin his first season and a Carling Cup semi-final and 10th\u2011placed finish in his second, said: \"I am very shocked and disappointed to be leaving Blackburn Rovers. I am extremely proud to have managed this club and I enjoyed a fantastic relationship with the players, my staff and the supporters.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
