Well, perhaps that\u2019s true \u2013 but not in the way that he thinks. The history of Malaspina\u2019s beloved Pellegrini\u2019s illustrates the obvious similarities between the prejudices of the past and those that lurk at the edges of Walker\u2019s piece. In his book Italians in Australia, Francesco Ricatti explains the prism through which southern European immigrants were once viewed: In the late 19th century, and indeed well into the 20th century, the \u2018scientific\u2019 theories of Italian anthropologists such as Lombroso and Niceforo \u2013 who argued for the racial inferiority of southern Italians and their racial proximity to Africans \u2013 were very popular not just in Italy but also in the Americas. In countries of Italian migration like the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and Australia, these theories fostered the idea that southern Italian migrants were not really white, that they were racially ambiguous, that they had a drop of black blood in their veins, and that they were the \u2018Chinese of Europe\u2019. The use of southern Italians as replacement for the indentured labour of Pacific Islanders reinforced this identification of Italian immigrants as non-white. In 1907, the Bulletin solemnly explained that, while northern Italians should be classified as degenerated Germans, southerners possessed distinctly African blood. \u201cBy the 1920s,\u201d says Ricatti, \u201cItalians were often described as \u2018black Mediterranean\u2019, and there is some anecdotal evidence that a variation of this expression, namely \u2018black Italians\u2019, was still used in north Queensland in the 1960s.\u201d Furthermore, like many immigrants today, Italians were victims of religious bigotry. They might not have been Muslim but they were Catholic, which, at the time, was far, far worse. The respectable Protestant ruling class associated the Church of Rome with disloyalty (until 2013, a Catholic was automatically disqualified from succession in the royal family), a prejudice reinforced by the involvement of Catholics in the Easter Uprising of 1916. Thus, in 1920, Smith\u2019s Weekly, a publication oriented to returned soldiers, labelled the Italian migrant as a \u201cdirty dago pest\u201d and campaigned against \u201ca greasy flood of Mediterranean scum that seeks to defile and debase Australia\u201d. That long history of anti-Italian racism makes the public embrace of Pellegrini\u2019s both remarkable and relevant. In 1954, the year that the brothers Leo and Vildo Pellegrini established their restaurant, a mass meeting brought some 2,000 people to the Sydney Town Hall. They were there to protest, in very Walker-like terms, at \u201cthe irreparable harm being done to our social structure and national culture by the immigration policy of the federal government\u201d. But they weren\u2019t upset about Muslims or Sudanese. Instead, they railed against \u201cfurther migration from southern Europe\u201d, with the main speaker, a Mr Aubrey Downer, denouncing \u201ca constant shuffle of Italian liners back and forth bringing some of the most undesirable residents\u201d. Today, Walker blames the political class for failing to address honestly and overtly concerns about immigration, except by surreptitiously imposing a ceiling on net overseas migration. In 1954, Downer made a very similar claim. \u201cThe number of Italians and other southern Europeans flooding this country,\u201d he said, \u201care of vital statistical import if the object of the census is to collate fundamental facts. Is it that the Migration Department is desperately anxious that the number of foreign communities in this country be concealed?\u201d Walker tells us that in Melbourne, \u201cpolice are being run ragged in their efforts to combat ethnic crime\u201d, and singles out Sudanese youths for special mention. That Town Hall meeting heard the same arguments about Italians. \u201c[I]t is impossible,\u201d said Downer, \u201cto pick up a daily newspaper without some fresh crime by a new settler being reported, mostly of a serious nature.\u201d It was, in fact, an ubiquitous argument during that decade. A year earlier, Truth had denounced a \u201cterrorist racket on migration\u201d, in which the dreaded \u201cBlack Hand\u201d society was said to be smuggling Italians into Australia. \u201cNew Australians should be photographed and fingerprinted,\u201d it concluded, \u201cand rigorously checked to exclude undesirables.\u201d Along similar lines, the Sydney event passed a resolution linking immigration with criminality, in which the protesters demanded the deportation of \u201call migrants convicted of serious offences in Australia\u201d. By 1958, Pellegrini\u2019s had grown large enough to extend from its original, tiny premises into a bigger space. That was the year that, during a parliamentary debate, an MP casually explained that southern Italians \u201chad no law but that of the tooth and the knife\u201d. It\u2019s a passage the current rhetoric about Sudanese people grotesquely echoes. Today, Australian expats claim the flat white coffee as almost a signature drink, a caffeinated emblem of antipodean culture. But in the 50s the espresso machine deployed for the first time at Pellegrini\u2019s represented the heights of exoticism. When contemporary conservatives sneer at \u201clatte drinking\u201d intellectuals, they\u2019re inadvertently channelling the prejudices of a half century ago, back when only the effete intelligentsia would join Italians in enjoying a decent brew. The centrality of Italians (and other southern Europeans) in industries like construction and manufacturing meant that they played a crucial role in the political and industrial struggles out of which contemporary multiculturalism emerged. But that\u2019s another story. Suffice to say that the enormous affection for Pellegrini\u2019s exemplifies a tremendous social reform, with an identity once mocked and feared by respectable Australia moving to the very centre of the culture. We might, if we so chose, see Malaspina\u2019s murder as the occasion for a renewed nativism, in which all the old fears about immigrants would be voiced. Alternatively, we could understand the grief over his death as illustrating the potential to overcome prejudice, even in the most difficult of circumstances. \u2022 Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
