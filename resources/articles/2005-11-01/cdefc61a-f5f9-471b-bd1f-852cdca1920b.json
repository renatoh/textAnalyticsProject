Where is the cheapest place you can try heli-skiing? Jeremy Wilson, Bracknell A. Heli-skiing burns aviation fuel, contributing to global warming. It would be better for the future of snowsports if you went ski-touring, and hiked for your fresh powder. If you must try it, the most affordable option is a day with a resort-based operation. The cheapest involve a mix of lifts and one helicopter flight. Ski 2 (www.ski-2.com) can arrange a day out of Champoluc for \u00a3160. This includes a run from the 4,000m Col di Lys to Zermatt via the Monte Rosa Glacier, then a second off-piste run (via lift) from the Breithorn back to Champoluc. Zermatt Mountain Guides (www.zermatt-mountainguide.ch) offers a tour 'around the Matterhorn' via an on-piste run to Cervinia, then heli to the Stockji Glacier for \u00a3172. A full day of heli-rides is pricier. In Panorama, a day (five runs) with RK Heliski (www.rkheliski.com) is \u00a3370. It's a similar price for a day with Whistler Heli-skiing (www.whistlerheliskiing.com). Perhaps the cheapest is New Zealand; Harris Mountains Heli-Ski (www.heliski.co.nz) offers a seven-run day for \u00a3381. \u00b7 Send your ski questions on resorts, technique and equipment to Martin at travel.tips@observer.co.uk. \u00b7 For details of Martin Bell 's coaching see www.skimartinbell.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
