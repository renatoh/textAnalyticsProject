The eldest son of a farmer, born near Seta, Albinas grew up in the new, independent Lithuania, born out of the treaty of Versailles. Enrolled at the agriculture school in Vepriai, he had hopes of becoming an agronomist, but war intervened. His family narrowly avoided being arrested and sent to Siberia when the Russians invaded in 1940, and in June 1941 Albinas learned of how Jewish friends and neighbours were murdered by German Einsatz squadrons (paramilitary killing squads) and their Lithuanian collaborators. During the war years, Albinas's family eked out a living on their smallholding in the forest, each night putting food outside on the porch for the desperate and sometimes dangerous people hiding amongst the trees. On 16 February \u2013 Lithuanian Independence day \u2013 in 1944, Albinas stood with other students on his college balcony to hear General Povilas Plechavi\u010dius's radio appeal for volunteers to join an independent Lithuanian unit. He later recalled how they all sang the national anthem and headed for the recruitment office. It was a short, ill-fated adventure. Plechavi\u010dius's dream of an independent unit was impossible. The Nazis eventually forced them to don German uniforms and shipped them out at gunpoint in cattle wagons to the western front. In 1945 Albinas found himself near the Dutch border unable to return home. After time in German displaced persons camps, like many young Balts he was granted refugee status by the British government, working firstly as a miner in the Midlands, before finally settling in London and working as a bookkeeper. In the capital he met Titia, a Dutch nurse, bought a house and went on to have a family \u2013 me and my sister, Diana. At a time when few had even heard of Lithuania, Albinas continued to work tirelessly to promote the plight of the Baltic states and their emigre communities. One of his proudest moments came in January 1991 when the BBC asked him to translate radio reports of the Soviet repression of the independence movement. The news bulletin that night, describing Soviet tanks entering Vilnius, was based on my dad's transcriptions. Happily he lived to see a free Lithuania. He is survived by Titia, Diana and me, and his five grandchildren."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
