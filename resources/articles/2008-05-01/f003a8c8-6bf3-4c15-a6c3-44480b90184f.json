What is your vision for learning? How will ICT influence and support it? And will your new school environment, physical and virtual, meet the aspirations of your pupils? Across England, school leaders, staff, students, local authorities (LAs) and their communities have been asking these questions to develop their Strategy for Change plans, writes Hannah Jones. These will be submitted to the government next month to release their share of Primary Capital Programme (PCP) investment. This strategy will shape learning to come, possibly for the next 25 years. Scary, isn't it? The aim of this ambitious 14-year scheme, worth \u00a31.9bn in the first three years, is to rebuild and remodel at least half of England's 18,000 primary schools. It's about creating schools equipped for 21st-century learning, at the heart of their communities, in reach of every family. So where do we start? With talking about learning. Experience from the PCP pathfinder programmes and PCP's \"big brother\" project, Building Schools for the Future, have taught us that we have to start with wide-ranging discussions on learning. Those involved tell us these discussions can't start too early - they can start too late - and that ICT must be central. What are the trends in technology? How is the workplace changing and what are the implications for today's learners? How are our children learning inside and outside the classroom? Are they powering down to come to school, leaving ICT and the associated skills at the door? What curriculum will we be delivering? These are some of the big questions to consider as local authorities enter the programme. Expectations of these large-scale investment programmes are high, with the first evaluation of BSF revealing that more than 90% of school leaders are convinced that BSF will improve the quality of teaching and learning. Large-scale programmes like this have many levels of complexity and place heavy demands on school leaders and LAs. They are challenging projects with demanding timelines that can be at times energising and, at times, frustrating. Where authorities are successful at leading this, there is a strong, shared vision for 21st-century learning. Investment of this scale won't come again for a very long time. Now is the time to have your say. Influence the outcome of this investment; contribute to your local discussion on learning. There is so much at stake... \u00b7 Primary Capital Programme, a national conference being run be NCSL and the DCSF, will be held in London tomorrow.
