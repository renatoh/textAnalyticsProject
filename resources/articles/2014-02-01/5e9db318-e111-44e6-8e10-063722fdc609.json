Nowadays the room in question swaps between the original St James's Church, on the Dingle peninsula, Wilton's music hall, London, or, over the weekend just gone, the Glassworks in Derry; but that slogan still sums up the basic idea behind Other Voices \u2013 at the same time the smallest and the most revered of festivals in music. Although enjoyed round the world, including on the Guardian site, the event itself is all about intimacy, the antithesis of commercial stadium rock. The handful of tickets are dished out for free by lottery, and the biggest names (Snow Patrol, Elbow) mingle with the new Irish talent that the event does so much to expose. Founder Philip King and band-booker Aoife Woodlock don't have money for fees, but they don't need to. Their passion for the arts of melody and verse creates such magic that the very best in the business are happy to play for a song."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
