The ruins provide compelling evidence that the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, is not only pursuing a war against suicide bombers - as he claims - but wants to erase history: the eight-year interlude when Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority had some control over the West Bank and Gaza. In tandem with the physical destruction of Mr Arafat's diminished realm - which included the ransacking of the Palestinian statistics bureau, the education ministry, and the ministry of local government in Ramallah as well as hospitals and office buildings - Israeli soldiers last night stormed the house of one of his most eloquent defenders, the Palestinian information minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo. Israel has also launched a determined propaganda campaign against Mr Arafat, producing documents and cheque stubs which puport to show his direct links to suicide bombers. There is some understanding in Washington for the campaign against Mr Arafat. In his speech on Thursday, President Bush said of the Palestinian leader: \"The situation in which he finds himself today is largely of his own making. He's missed his opportunities and thereby betrayed the hopes of the people he's supposed to lead.\" However, Mr Sharon's offensive this week has far greater ambitions - a long-term project which will complete the destruction of a Palestinian administration, paralysed for 18 months by Israeli bombardments and blockades. It is unclear what Mr Sharon envisages next - a return to complete Israeli occupation of the West Bank, or the emergence of a pliant Palestinian leadership that will be willing to make peace on his terms - but he evidently believes it is worth the international isolation the Jewish state suffered this week. If the real focus of Israel's war in the West Bank is suicide bombers, Mr Sharon yesterday had two stunning successes. In Nablus last night, Palestinian sources reported the death of Nasser Awais, one of the seven founders of the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, which has taken the lead in attacks on Israel during the last three months. Nearby, in the town of Tubas, Israel killed a leading bombmaker from the military wing of Hamas, Qais Adwan. Israeli television said Adwan was responsible for the bombing of a Passover feast in the coastal city of Netanya which killed 26 Israelis in the deadliest such attack since the uprising began. The Israeli army's planning chief, Major General Giora Eiland, said yesterday that 1,200 Palestinian civilians have been rounded up in the raids on office buildings and private homes. He said 200 of these were wanted men, but Palestinians said many of those arrested were activists in the intifada in the late 1980s. The Israeli round-ups have also resulted in the widespread capture and humiliation of policemen who were stripped to their underwear and forced to hand over weapons. These are the very men tasked with stopping the suicide bombers. The war on the Palestinian police forces reached its apex when the Israeli army pounded the headquarters of the Preventative Security services for eight hours with helicopter gunships and tanks. Until this week, the preventative security force and its commander, Jibril Rajoub, were seen as untouchable. Mr Rajoub has close ties with the Israeli security apparatus and is viewed with suspicion by many Palestinians. He is also a protege of the CIA, and his headquarters were built with generous American assistance. \"Jibril Rajoub's force was the only Palestinian security service with the potential to enforce a ceasefire,\" said Khalil Shikaki, a Palestinian analyst in Ramallah. \"I believe the attack on his headquarters was a very serious one. Whoever made that decision is not thinking about co-operation in the very near future.\" Although the Israeli army has regularly bombed and shelled Palestinian police buildings during the 18-month uprising, and assassinated Palestinian militants, it stopped short of striking at the circle immediately around Mr Arafat. Such reservations have vanished, however, and the Israeli army is now actively hunting down Mr Arafat's senior political lieutenant in the West Bank, Marwan Barghouti, who is often mentioned as a possible successor to the Palestinian leader. Mr Sharon is also believed to be studying the possibility of arresting senior Palestinian security officials, most of whom have had years of contact with the CIA and their Israeli counterparts. Mr Shikaki believes the combined assaults on Palestinian institutions and the Palestinian leadership - encapsulated by the siege on Mr Arafat - are intended to encourage the rise of a new political generation, one that may be more amenable to making peace with Israel on Mr Sharon's terms. However, he believes that logic is fatally flawed. \"If Mr Arafat is exiled, he will continue to rule from outside, and his role will not be that different in the short term, but he will gradually be weakened,\" he said. \"But the Palestinian Authority institutions are becoming more fragmented than ever before. Eventually, if Mr Arafat remains in captivity, I believe his leadership will become nominal and the nationalist and Islamist groups will work together, and not necessarily with Mr Arafat.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
