Liverpool, who are at Bournemouth on Wednesday for a Capital One Cup quarter-final, are currently in talks with the player\u2019s representatives over a contract extension for Sterling. The 20-year-old\u2019s existing deal does not expire until 2017 but the club want to reward the forward\u2019s development into a key figure in Rodgers\u2019 squad, with improved terms. Real Madrid and Bayern Munich have been linked with the England international but despite Liverpool\u2019s regression this season and Su\u00e1rez\u2019s departure for Barcelona in the summer, Rodgers is confident Sterling\u2019s next contract will be signed at Anfield. Asked if the forward might consider leaving given Liverpool\u2019s current problems, the manager said: \u201cHopefully that won\u2019t be the case. We are a club that are trying to build something. We were on a path for a couple of years and of course we\u2019ve had to come off that path since the summer. We\u2019ve lost some players and are having to regroup again. \u201cRaheem is a real catalyst and talisman for this team. He\u2019s been a great example of the progress that a lot of the players have made here, going from a youth team player into one of the top young players in European football. The club will work very hard [on the new contract]. Raheem\u2019s happy here and loves being a Liverpool player. I\u2019m sure between them and his representatives we can get a deal done that sees him continue to develop what is an exciting career.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s Champions League defeat by Basel in October and elimination from the competition against the Swiss club last week were both followed by reports of problems in the contract negotiations with Sterling. Rodgers insists the claims did not originate from Sterling, who has shown no sign of being distracted by the talks. \u201cI think Raheem has been brilliant,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything affecting him in any way. He\u2019s the type of boy who leaves his representatives to work with the club in order to hopefully organise the deal. He has no real influence on that. \u201cAll I\u2019ve ever asked him to do is concentrate on his football, on preparing himself well, and the performances will come. And I think he\u2019s shown that consistently over this last period. I\u2019ll never be surprised that teams are linked with Raheem because he\u2019s such a big talent. He\u2019s just turned 20 years of age. He\u2019s a wonderful young player and a very mature young man. I\u2019m quite relaxed about the situation.\u201d Rodgers also claimed to be relaxed about his own position as manager, which is under fierce scrutiny ahead of the testing visit to the Championship leaders, which comes five years and a day after he was sacked by Reading. \u201cThe situation is totally different but that was probably the making of me as a manager,\u201d he said. Mario Balotelli, whose misconduct charge over an reportedly antisemitic post on social media will be heard by the FA on Thursday, is a doubt for the quarter-final with the groin problem that forced him to miss six matches before his return against Manchester United on Sunday while Glen Johnson will be sidelined for several weeks with the groin strain suffered at Old Trafford. That 3-0 defeat prompted Rodgers to concede that Liverpool must \u201crecapture the team ethos\u201d of last season but he denies there is unrest inside the dressing room. \u201cOur dressing room is very strong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very fortunate to have a captain who is a strong leader in the dressing room and that has been very important during my time here. Unrest is totally untrue. Of course we are unhappy at not winning games, these are competitive players who almost won the league last year and they won\u2019t be happy at losing because they are competitive people. Our spirit is very strong and once we get that break, we will show that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
