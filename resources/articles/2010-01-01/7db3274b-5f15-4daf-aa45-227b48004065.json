In essence a chamber oratorio \u2013 though occasionally staged, especially in Germany \u2013 Le Vin Herb\u00e9 inhabits a different world from Wagner's incomparably influential opera. Morally, it's more Brief Encounter than the Liebestod, and aesthetically the influence of Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande is palpable. The fact that Martin should write a medievalist Tristan for an orchestra of just eight players and a chorus of 12, plus tenor and soprano principals, is a powerfully defiant statement of his individuality. In operatic historical terms, it's a bit like standing in front of a tank in Tiananmen Square. Semi-professional performances of neglected repertoire like this one, by Ardente Opera, tend to fall into one of two categories. Either they are well-intentioned attempts, for which one has to make an awful lot of allowances, or one is so unexpectedly absorbed in the boldness of the evening that one simply overlooks any limitations. Le Vin Herb\u00e9, semi-staged in Hawksmoor's church, was of the latter sort. It made a compelling case for Martin's work. Under Julian Black's clear and sensitive direction, this strings and piano score was beautifully played (special mention for the first violin in part one, and the viola in part three), while the choral singing, the rock on which the work is built, was exquisitely balanced and dramatically projected. Angela Henckel sang with sustained warmth and beauty as Isolde, though without a focused impact; but Greg Tassell, whose tenor was sometimes overtaxed in Tristan's most agonised passages, articulated the text with gripping conviction. Soprano Raphaela Papadakis, mezzo Lila Palmer and the dramatic presence of the baritone Ashley Riches emphasised the depth of a notable collective achievement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
