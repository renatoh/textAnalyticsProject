The company said in a statement: \u201cThe board of Cambridge Analytica has announced today that it has suspended CEO Alexander Nix with immediate effect pending a full, independent investigation. \u201cIn the view of the board, Mr Nix\u2019s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.\u201d Cambridge Analytica said its chief data officer, Alexander Tayler, had been appointed acting chief executive while an investigation was carried out by Julian Malins QC, whose findings they would \u201cshare publicly in due course\u201d. \u201cThe board will be monitoring the situation closely, working closely with Dr Tayler, to ensure that Cambridge Analytica, in all of its operations, represents the firm\u2019s values and delivers the highest-quality service to its clients.\u201d Arriving at Cambridge Analytica\u2019s offices in New Oxford Street, London, on Tuesday, Nix told reporters \u201cappearances can be deceptive\u201d when asked about the Channel 4 News filming. Asked if the company would abandon its political work Nix gave no reply but firmly denied he had misled parliament when he gave evidence over its use of data, saying: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d He was seen leaving the office at 6.30pm through a fire exit door and did not answer questions as he got into a waiting black Mercedes. In a series of secret recordings broadcast on Channel 4 News Nix claimed credit for the election of Donald Trump. He told an undercover reporter: \u201cWe did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy.\u201d Revealing the firm\u2019s system of erasing any digital footprint, he said they used a self-destruct email server. He added: \u201cNo one knows we have it, and secondly we set our \u2026 emails with a self-destruct timer \u2026 So you send them and after they\u2019ve been read, two hours later, they disappear. There\u2019s no evidence, there\u2019s no paper trail, there\u2019s nothing.\u201d He was also recorded explaining how Cambridge Analytica set up proxy organisations to feed untraceable messages on to social media. And he mocked an investigation by the US House intelligence committee, to which he gave evidence in 2017. In the footage, he claimed Republican members asked just three questions. \u201cAfter five minutes \u2013 done.\u201d He added: \u201cThey\u2019re politicians, they\u2019re not technical. They don\u2019t understand how it works.\u201d He claimed that Democrats on the committee were motivated by \u201csour grapes\u201d. He further boasted that the firm could avoid any US investigation into its foreign clients, saying: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced that they have no jurisdiction \u2026 We\u2019ll say none of your business.\u201d Nix added that the election candidates were never told what was going on, agreeing that they were \u201cpuppets\u201d in the hands of their campaign teams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
