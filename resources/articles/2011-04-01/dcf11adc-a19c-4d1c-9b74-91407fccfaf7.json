The teenager had been found strangled, with his hands and throat bound with rope and his eyes and mouth taped shut. His body had been abandoned in a vacant lot in the poor town of Lowell, setting for the recent hit film The Fighter. It was a gruesome crime and one that remained unsolved for more than four decades. Until late last week, when police made three arrests. What they revealed has caught the imagination of America. Instead of being a random crime, police now believe McCabe was murdered by three of his fellow teenagers, who kept their grim secret between themselves for 42 years. The brutal murder was allegedly an unpleasant childish prank and an act of jealousy that went dreadfully wrong. McCabe's only mistake \u2013 the one that got him killed \u2013 was simply to talk to the wrong girl at a youth dance. Court papers filed by police after the arrests of local men Walter Shelley, 60, Edward Brown, 59, and Michael Ferreira, 57, detail what authorities now believe happened on that night. It is a portrait of a tragedy, for which all three men face charges of murder or manslaughter. The papers reveal that the three men were driving around in Shelley's Chevy Impala when they saw McCabe walking home from the dance where he had apparently been spotted chatting to Shelley's girlfriend. The three stopped and decided to teach McCabe a lesson, police say. They beat McCabe and dragged him into the car. Eventually they drove to the lot where his body would later be found. They tied him up and bound him with a rope wrapped around his neck and tied to his ankles, even though the tearful McCabe begged to be let go. \"They continued to taunt him, telling him this is what he got for messing with [Shelley's girlfriend],\" the court documents stated. The three then left McCabe where he lay. When they returned a few hours later McCabe, who had apparently tried to stand up, had died after being strangled by the rope around his neck. The three panicked and fled. The astonishing story has stunned residents of the close-knit towns of Lowell and nearby Tewksbury, where McCabe was from. The victim's family, including his elderly parents, Evelyn and William McCabe, were in court in Lowell when two of the alleged killers appeared. When surrounded by TV crews and reporters asking for their response to the stunning developments, William McCabe said: \"We are still a little shell-shocked.\" Evelyn McCabe said: \"He was a good kid. I couldn't punish him for nothing. So I let him go to the dance. Do you know how many times I've regretted that? I regret that right now.\" Police say they never gave up on the case after their initial investigation faded. McCabe's parents and relatives always kept up some sort of pressure over the years and police paid tribute to their efforts at a news conference. \"Their determination to see this matter resolved motivated all of us in law enforcement to keep this matter on the front burner,\" Lowell police superintendent Ken Lavallee told a news conference. Another source of pressure was Carol Coffey, a woman who was meant to be McCabe's date to the fateful dance but whose mother made her stay at home. Then, several years ago, Lowell police set up a \"cold case\" project. Initial suspects and witnesses were spoken to again in 2008, including Ferreira. Local news reports have named Brown as the person who finally talked. The Lowell Sun said Brown told police of a vow of silence the three young friends took in the aftermath of finding McCabe dead. \"Brown allegedly told police they were fearful they would be caught, so they took a vow of silence. Ferreira allegedly threatened to kill anyone who broke that vow,\" the paper said, citing court documents."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
