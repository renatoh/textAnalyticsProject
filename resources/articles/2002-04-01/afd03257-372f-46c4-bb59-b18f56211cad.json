Now he will have to find an alternative date before his wedding in July, and he has also played himself into contention for Wales's summer tour of South Africa. After being knocked back in one tackle by Bryant, Irish's player-coach Brendan Venter wagged his finger at his opposite number. \"He told me that there was a long way to go and that they were going to win,\" said Bryant, whose performance brought to mind Scott Gibbs on the 1997 Lions tour to South Africa with his totemic tackling. \"I replied that he was the one on the floor. I do not think Irish showed us enough respect. They expected to do to us what they had done to Northampton the previous week and they paid the price.\" Pontypridd are the Welsh equivalent of London Irish, a team of few current internationals whose whole is considerably greater than the sum of its parts. Six months ago their goal was to avoid relegation from the Welsh-Scottish League, but the return of Lynn Howells as coach helped galvanise them from whipping boys to winners and they have two cup finals to look forward to next month. Irish expected Pontypridd to tire, but not only did the Welsh finish the stronger, they earned the distinction of scoring more points against the Exiles than any other side had managed this season, passing the 30 run up by Leicester at the Madejski Stadium last December. Irish, last week's Powergen Cup winners, had only lost one match this year, at Gloucester back in February, but they never held the lead on Saturday. They trailed 14-0 after 20 minutes and 21-7 in the third quarter before rallying to 21-21. Their three tries resulted from Pontypridd mistakes but when the Welshmen tightened up in the second half, as they had in the Principality Cup semi-final against Cardiff earlier this month, they stopped the key Exiles runners, Chris Sheasby and Venter, from crossing the gainline and the favourites became shapeless. Irish were six points down with 12 minutes to go and pounded the Pontypridd line. A number of last-ditch tackles kept them out before the flanker Declan Danaher lost patience and kneed an opponent in front of the touch judge. The attacking momentum was lost and with it the match. The game in Wales has been shrouded in gloom this season but the Welsh Rugby Union reacted indignantly last week to the demand from the Wales First Minister Rhodri Morgan that it reform itself. It will cite Pontypridd's victory as evidence that Morgan was wrong - though it should be noted that the governing body had such faith in Ponty beating Irish that it called a special general meeting of its clubs on the date of the Shield final to debate the way ahead.
