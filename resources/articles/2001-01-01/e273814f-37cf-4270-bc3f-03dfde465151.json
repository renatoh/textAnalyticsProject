At the time, Cantona told a Croydon Court press conference: 'When the seagulls follow the trawler it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea.' He was hailed by the Independent as utilising 'Derrida's decontextualisation of discourse', but has now admitted he was actually talking 'bollocks'. 'My lawyer and the officials wanted me to speak, but there was nothing to say' he told French TV. 'So, I said nothing, it did not mean anything. I could have said, \"The curtains are pink but I love them.\" I just spoke because I had to.' Asprilla: big gun lashes out Former Newcastle Faustino Asprilla - 'shocked and upset' after Bobby Robson rejected a chance to re-sign him last week - has knocked out an opponent after being punched during a friendly. The Colombian, who was playing for Fluminense against Friburguense, said there was only so much provocation he could take. 'Why should I be a saint when people thump me?' said Asprilla. 'It made my blood boil. I played two years in England, where the football was really war-like, and I was never sent off. I played six years in Italy and I only got a couple of red cards.' He has, though, been involved in a string of arms offences, most recently when a woman refused his advances. He's passed Kieron Dyer's video audition in advance, but the gaffer won't relent. 'I'm not sure he's the one for us,' says Robson. 'Would he bring his gun?' Morton crisis: online revival Another supporters trust has launched an online presence in a bid to stave off disaster. Greenock Morton, run into the ground under the ownership of Hugh Scott ('this club is going the same way as the shipyards'), are still in serious trouble: visit www.paulfarren.mortonfans.co.uk for news and ways to help. Letter of the week Dear Sir, With reference to Said &amp; Done on Sunday 21st January, I write to congratulate you on your item 'Mellor: may he rest in silence'. As a regular recipient of Mr Mellor's abuse, spite and inaccuracies your piece certainly brightened up my Sunday. Perhaps the most fitting 'epitaph' would be the George Carman quote, 'like an ostrich he is prone to burying his head in the sand and thus revealing his thinking parts'. To paraphrase Mellor, fortunately we will no longer be 'as sick as a parrot' at the thought of him coming on 606 but instead 'over the moon' at his absence form the airwaves. If Greg Dyke, Director General of the BBC, is behind this then he should be congratulated on such a good move for football and all its fans. Gordon Taylor Chief Executive, Professional Footballers' Association Spot the agent David Pleat, denying a transfer rumour linking Tim Sherwood with a move back to Blackburn: 'We have had no contact at all from Blackburn Rovers. This looks like a case of a monster, monster agent trying to make monster, monster mischief.'
