During that time, thousands more people have been killed by weapons around the country, including another 12 exactly one week ago in the most recent mass shooting in Virginia Beach. It\u2019s what Swalwell, a Democratic congressman from California, considers a carousel of misery, a seemingly endless cycle of killing, mourning, outrage and demands for change, always followed by sympathy and platitude, but never any action, from lawmakers in Washington DC. Yet he sees hope despite the ever-rising death toll. And he challenges the suggestion that one of the biggest problems preventing action on gun legislation is people either not caring or not believing that anything will ever change. \u201cI know why people may believe that, because we\u2019re on this carousel where loss, grief, anger and then thoughts and prayers from Washington is an alibi for doing nothing,\u201d he said in an interview with the Guardian ahead of national gun violence awareness day. Swalwell pointed at the success of groups like Moms Demand Action, a grassroots movement fighting for public safety measures to protect people from gun violence, in challenging the influence of the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the 2016 midterm elections. \u201cSo there\u2019s hope where hope had died before. That\u2019s what motivates me,\u201d Swalwell said. Swalwell has aligned himself with the families and student survivors from Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Florida, where 17 students and teachers were murdered in February 2018, and their March for Our Lives movement that captured the world\u2019s attention afterwards. He has several proposals to tackle the guns crisis and remove military-style assault weapons from the streets of the US, including a controversial buy-back program that goes further than any of his rivals vying for the Democratic presidential nomination for 2020. \u201cAssault rifles may account for a small number of gun violence deaths but they account for 100% of the fear that kids have. That\u2019s the weapon they saw used in Parkland, they\u2019ve seen used in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and Las Vegas. They\u2019re afraid of this particular weapon. So it\u2019s not just the lives you save, it\u2019s the peace of mind you bring.\u201d In America\u2019s schools, he believes, the threat of gun violence has wreaked an incalculable toll, from the regular lockdown drills that students must endure to passing armed law enforcement officers every day at the campus gates. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it has to be the new normal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the lives lost but the trauma and anxiety that every kid in America is going through right now, that you can\u2019t quantify so easily, but will have lasting effects on their lives because of gun violence in our schools. \u201cIn Virginia Beach, one of the witnesses saw the shooter going through the building and thought it was a drill,\u201d he said, referring to last week\u2019s shooting at a municipal building in the city. \u201cThink about that. We\u2019ve had so many mass shooting drills that when a shooting happens it\u2019s just like a burglar alarm or fire alarm going off, and we\u2019re not reacting the way that we should.\u201d Swalwell believes a majority of Americans supports stricter gun restrictions. \u201c[Most people] believe you can keep your pistols, keep your shotguns, keep your rifles, but get dangerous weapons out of the hands of dangerous people,\u201d he said. If the public has grown immune to the lengthening list of tragedy \u2013 from Columbine and Sandy Hook to Orlando, Las Vegas, Parkland and now Virginia Beach \u2013 Swalwell says he has seen no evidence of it. He recounted an exchange at a recent gun violence town hall in Fairfield, in a rural part of south-eastern Iowa. More than a hundred people showed up, Swalwell said, despite it being a single-issue town hall. \ufeff\u201cI asked if this community seems fairly safe, why would you show up to talk about gun violence? This woman said, \u2018because I don\u2019t want it coming to my church\u2019,\u201d he recounted. \u201cSo there is a recognition that when you look at the victims \u2026 they\u2019re black, they\u2019re white, they\u2019re young, they\u2019re old. The victims are starting to look and come from all parts of America, and my hope is that more and more people believe we don\u2019t have to live this way,\u201d he said. One marked change, Swalwell believes, is that the midterm election results have shown the influence of the NRA has diminished. \u201cWe figured out in this last election that it\u2019s just noise, that their tactic is to bully and to be vocal, but that they\u2019re a vocal minority,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want us to believe it\u2019s a divisive issue. As a tactic it\u2019s been effective for a while. We would always say we\u2019re only allowed to grieve these shootings, we\u2019re not allowed to act, and any time we would try to act we were told, well, you know, you\u2019re touching a very hot issue, it\u2019ll lead to a cultural war in America. \u201cBut for the NRA, the gig is up,\u201d he added. If anybody still doubts the strength of public opinion on gun issues in the US, Swalwell says, they need look no further than Parkland. \u201cI saw Parkland as a place where hope died. But in a uniquely American way, owing to the strength and courage of children, it\u2019s a place where hope was reborn, where I believe we have an opportunity to seize momentum to make sure that kids are safe in their classrooms,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
