I\u2019ve just told them I know next to nothing about Sibblies Drury\u2019s Pulitzer prizewinner, and their smiles mirror each other. Latif nods and says one word: \u201cGreat!\u201d I think I know three things about Fairview: it revolves around a black American family, there\u2019s some exploration of class, or specifically, the black middle class, and there\u2019s something to do with surveillance. Is that correct? What else can I know about the play? Sibblies Drury smiles. \u201cIt takes place in a theatre. And there\u2019s going to be an audience.\u201d Latif interjects: \u201cHopefully! And there\u2019s a set.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s totally a set.\u201d The two laugh again. The media around a play typically tells a possible audience what it will be \u201cabout\u201d. This makes sense: people want to know if a play will appeal to them, and information about characters, themes and plot can convince them to buy tickets. But Fairview bucks this trend. From the reviews of its original run in the US to the Young Vic\u2019s website and social media channels, information about what actually happens in the play is scant. This is what Sibblies Drury wanted, and Latif (as well as most journalists) has been more than happy to get on board. \u201cNo great thing is about any one thing,\u201d Latif says. Sibblies Drury agrees. \u201cIf you can sum it up in one sentence, it would be a lot easier to just read that one sentence.\u201d But the silence, says Sibblies Drury, is \u201cnot for plot reasons. It\u2019s not like you find out that someone was dead the whole time. I think that it\u2019s more allowing oneself the ability to have your own experience watching something. The way that people process things is a really individual thing, and experience is individual in terms of your upbringing, in terms of your class, in terms of your race, in terms of the people that you\u2019ve been friends with, the books that you\u2019ve read, your references.\u201d Latif agrees. \u201cTheatre is not film, or TV, or Netflix. It\u2019s a live art form. If you come to this show, knowing too much about it, you\u2019re not having a live experience. You\u2019ve in some way already processed what it\u2019s about. So I think there\u2019s something about encouraging you to have a live experience from minute zero to minute 100. Just come and have a collective, communal life experience, and then at the end, you can process it.\u201d Latif herself did not watch Fairvew before agreeing to direct it. She and Kwame Kwei-Armah, artistic director of the Young Vic, were looking for plays. \u201cHe went to New York and called me on his way back, \u2018I\u2019ve just seen this play, and you need to have read it by the time I land.\u2019 I really strongly didn\u2019t want to do an African American play, because I was conscious I\u2019d done quite a number of them. I wanted to find something that felt close to me. But then I read it and was like, \u2018Oh, but it is!\u2019 I think it reaches beyond an African American experience towards a black experience, or an \u2018othered\u2019 experience.\u201d She continues: \u201cI thought [Kwame] was asking if we should programme it. I was like, \u2018Obviously\u2019, and he goes, \u2018Well, do you want to direct it?\u2019 I was like\u2026 yes, trick question. Then I just had to do the small job of persuading this woman.\u201d She wrote a letter explaining her reasons for wanting to direct Fairview. \u201cWhen I was first told of your interest, I was a little bit afraid that it was like \u2026\u201d Sibblies Drury trails off. \u201cThe only two black kids in the class, so they have to date each other. You know what I mean? \u2026 But you were like, \u2018I\u2019m black, you\u2019re black. But that\u2019s not the only reason that I should direct this play.\u2019 And I was like, ah, I am refreshed.\u201d At the time, the off-Broadway production of Fairview gained a lot of buzz. But since then Fairview has shifted from \u201cwell-received\u201d to \u201cmost recent winner of the Pulitzer prize for drama\u201d. \u201cEvery play that I\u2019ve ever done has sort of been about managing people\u2019s disappointments in a way where they don\u2019t feel disappointed at the end,\u201d Sibblies Drury says. \u201cThat feels particularly true of this. Because I feel some people are going to come in and be like, \u2018Oh, this has won a fancy award. This must be a fancy experience.\u2019 And they\u2019re going to come and be like, \u2018What?\u2019\u201d Latif says that the play\u2019s ideas are so complex that \u201cin a way, the fourth act is what happens to you afterwards. How you process it. And I\u2019m totally happy for there to be intellectual backlash. That\u2019s cool, because that\u2019s a conversation. I\u2019m terrified of things that are universally lauded, I feel like that\u2019s a full stop.\u201d For now, keeping information about Fairview to a minimum is possible. But at some point, just like Death of a Salesman or Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, the Pulitzer-winning title will mean more, and more people will find out about the play\u2019s plot. Can Sibblies Drury imagine Fairview being produced regularly, for decades to come? She pauses. \u201cNo. I hope not. I think it\u2019s a hard play to do well. Also to me, it feels like its shelf life isn\u2019t going to be very long. Hopefully, because of society. I do hope that part of the charm of the show is that it sort of puts together all of these stereotypes that are so ingrained into our consciousness that we like barely register them as that any more. And so hopefully pointing out those stereotypes won\u2019t feel fresh or interesting or new relatively soon. But maybe that\u2019s optimistic.\u201d Fairview is at the Young Vic theatre, London, until 18 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
