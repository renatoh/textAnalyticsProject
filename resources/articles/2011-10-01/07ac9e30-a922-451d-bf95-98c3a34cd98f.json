The 31-year-old fan was arrested after the incident, which took place on the 7th green as Woods prepared to take a birdie putt. The hot dog bun barely reached the green, though the hot dog itself landed on the putting surface. \"Some guy just came running on the green and he had a hot dog, and evidently \u2026 I don't know how he tried to throw it, but I was kind of focusing on my putt when he started yelling,\" Woods said afterwards \"Next thing I know, he laid on the ground, and looked like he wanted to be arrested because he \u2026 put his hands behind his back and turned his head.\" The man was immediately restrained by police officers and removed from the course. Arjun Atwal, a good friend of Woods and his playing partner for the day, said he was concerned for a moment at the sight of a fan yelling out Woods's name and approaching the green. \"They could have shot him,\" Atwal said. \"The cops could have thought it was something else.\" Woods appeared unfazed, although he did note his failure to hole the birdie putt after the incident. Still there was some cause for optimism in the Woods camp, not least his three-under round of 68 \u2013 his third successive 68. That was good enough for a 72-hole total of 277, seven under par and a tie for 30th place. \"I got better every day and unfortunately, a couple times I didn't get the momentum going when I had a couple of chances to make putts. I could have just really got it rolling,\" he said. \"I haven't played much.\" \"That comes with competitive flow, understanding the situations and feels, and game time is a little bit different.\" The tournament went to a play-off between Briny Baird and Bryce Molder, each seeking his first PGA tournament win, though Baird has had four runners-up finishes. Paul Casey finished in a tie for seventh after a final round of 71, six behind the leaders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
