Everton have not beaten Liverpool since October 2010 and a winless sequence of 16 league derbies is the longest barren spell in the club\u2019s history. The manner of Liverpool\u2019s victory in the 96th minute of December\u2019s derby also smarts for Marco Silva\u2019s side, whose form plummeted afterwards. However, none of those factors compare with the prize of landing Liverpool\u2019s first league championship since 1990, according to Van Dijk, who insists the greater motivation at Goodison Park on Sunday will be among the players in red. The Liverpool defender said: \u201cI\u2019ve played in the Old Firm derby, which is really intense. When I played Rangers were lower level-wise than they are now, so it was pretty easy back then. But this is the Premier League and it\u2019s totally different. It will be a game that can go either way and sometimes in these type of games it is who wants it the most. We are in a position where we definitely want it the most and hopefully we can show it on the pitch.\u201d Van Dijk expects \u201ca game full of passion\u201d and says he will thrive on the knowledge that Everton, like Manchester United last weekend, are desperate to damage their rivals\u2019 title challenge. \u201cI like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is always something which motivates you even more and it is a great game to play in. It\u2019s the derby and it\u2019s special but we want to show our quality, win the game \u2013 hopefully with good football but if not we are going to fight for it.\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp is friends with a few Evertonians who, as a result, want Liverpool to win the Premier League rather than Manchester City. He refused to divulge names for safety reasons. \u201cI am not allowed to speak about it,\u201d the Liverpool manager, who has won five and drawn two of his seven Merseyside derbies, said, jokingly. \u201cIn my normal life I meet quite a lot of Evertonians. They are all nice. I am not sure I am allowed to say that. I promised I would not say their names because that could cause them problems and I don\u2019t want that. \u201cBecause they know me they think it is better for us [to win the league] than somebody else they don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s not OK to talk about that, because it could cause them real problems. I don\u2019t want that.\u201d Klopp believes Liverpool\u2019s dominance of the derby in recent years should inspire rather than intimidate Everton\u2019s players on Sunday, when Goodison will host its 100th league meeting between the clubs. He said: \u201cThat [nine years unbeaten] is much easier to work on for the other side. It is much easier to motivate them and say: \u2018Come on boys, it\u2019s time. It\u2019s our moment.\u2019 It\u2019s much easier for them. We don\u2019t think about that actually. We are on the other side. \u201cWe respect them a lot as a team. That is how we have to see it. That is how we have to deal with it, not thinking we have had a couple of good results. \u201cWe were lucky in the last game, scored in the last second, and lucky when Sadio Man\u00e9 scored the late winner at Goodison [in 2016]. It is never a normal game. It\u2019s always really special. \u201cWe have had difficult games against Everton but really good results and that is the only thing we have to think about. We have to think about what we did attitude-wise in these games so we were always ready. We have to be that again. \u201cIt is really important we don\u2019t take anything \u2013 not just in this game but in all games \u2013 for granted. Just work for it and the world is open.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
