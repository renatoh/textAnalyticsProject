It concerns the nature of its contents. Whatever the cocktail of liquid hallucinogens that allowed the ICC chief executive to \"concentrate on the positives rather than the negatives\" when assessing the tournament last weekend, with crowds occasionally nudging triple figures and an international coach dead, presumed murdered, it must be a fairly lively brew. Last week, Malcolm was finally moved to address the sepulchral atmosphere in some of the grounds, when he revealed that spectators wishing to take in musical instruments had been required to write to local organising committees for formal permission. \"We want the Caribbean atmosphere to be here,\" he explained to bemused local reporters in Guyana. \"But there is a protocol. You would find similar requirements at other tournaments, such as the upcoming Masters golf championship.\" Ah yes, the Masters . . . As anyone who has ever attended a cricket match in the West Indies will attest, there is no more analogous event in terms of ideal atmosphere than the Masters, played out on the reggae-pulsing greens of Augusta, where everyone's your friend and your hosts are comfortably the least repressed people on the entire planet. Malcolm was evidently attempting to make some kind of satirical point about the fiascoid spectacle in the Caribbean. Indeed, by describing the tournament as \"a huge legacy product\", he reminds us that sporting events are increasingly just plot devices in the far more exciting narrative of amenity regeneration - something we shall no doubt feel even more keenly as the 2012 Olympics approaches. As for contriving to blame the prohibitively high ticket prices on the local organising committees - well, he does much to dispel the image of his organisation as a bunch of blazer-clad chisellers who would no more cough to a gross error of judgment than they would admit to having once had slightly confusing feelings about a boy in the year below them at school. And yet, even by the apparently minimal performance standards required, can Malcolm truly be said to be delivering in his sinecure? Having staged World Cup matches in Zimbabwe last time around, the bar was not desperately high. On that occasion, Malcolm refused to state whether or not he'd have staged matches in Nazi Germany. Not the most finely balanced question, you might think, but it's a tribute to his judgment that he dismissed it out of hand. \"We simply don't make political judgments,\" he ruled. \"They're for politicians.\" On the issue of the use of performance-enhancing drugs in cricket, though, he has been less circumspect. Less than two years ago, when the players' federation warned that the expanding fixture calendar might tempt cricketers to use drugs to assist in recovery, as has occurred in other sports, Malcolm was having absolutely none of it. \"Remarks like that,\" he exploded, \"serve no purpose in a reasoned debate.\" At least on the vaguely topical issue of spot-fixing, the best that may be said is that the hopelessness of others has flattered the ICC chairman's stance into appearing adequate. After all, who wouldn't benefit from comparison with the England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, David Morgan, who stated prior to the World Cup: \"I sit at the ICC and hear annual reports from Lord Condon . . . and at no stage has spot-fixing been talked about as something that is prevalent in the game.\" (We shall draw a veil over the Condon Report's express finding that match-fixing breeds in the uncompetitive matches for which the ICC, under Malcolm's stewardship, has exhibited such an apparent mania.) Does all this add up to a good innings? It was our hero who memorably summarised the Oval ball-tampering row last summer as \"a series of unfortunate and entirely avoidable over-reactions\" and, taken in isolation, many of his ICC career lows might be regarded as unfortunate. Taken together, however, they make one wonder how long Speed can continue stretching the phrase \"taking responsibility\" to limits of meaninglessness disdained even by Tony Blair. The esteemed chief executive's motto seems to be \"Nothing to see here\" - a point the empty seats in the Caribbean are making most eloquently for him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
