With Eugenie Le Sommer\u2019s side-footed opener - her 11th goal in 11 internationals - followed by a Wendie Renard double header giving France a 3-0 first-half lead, then added to by captain Amandine Henry for a 4-0 win, the vital Lyon spine of Les Bleues was evident. Renard was delighted with her contribution. \u201cI\u2019d never scored in a World Cup and it really feels good, on a personal level, but above all as a team, she said. \u201cThese were very important goals just before half-time, for our confidence.\u201d Moments before kick off the rain that had rendered the sprinklers superfluous lifted, the sun came out and the floodlights beamed, just as the teams emerged from the tunnel and everything suddenly felt brighter. The grey of the weather and the ticketing and organisational chaos outside suddenly felt a lot less important to a heaving Parc des Princes bowl. With La Marseillaise echoing round the stadium with gusto, tears in the eyes of many a French player evident, finally the football was starting. \u201cWe knew that it was going to be a very emotional evening, but we managed it well,\u201d said Renard. \u201cWhen you have 45,000 people singing the French national anthem, obviously it drives you forward, but we really made the most of the crowd\u2019s support.\u201d Diacre blocked out any feelings on the atmosphere though: \u201cI refused all emotion tonight. I will let emotion affect me later on in the competition. I have prepared as if I were a player. There\u2019s no room for emotion tonight,\u201d she said. In the second minute France made their first chance. Griedge Mbock Bathy\u2019s crossfield pass found Eugenie Le Sommer on the touchline, she slipped a square pass to an onrushing Henry who laid off to Kadidiatou Diani but her shot was blocked, it fell to Henry though who whipped a shot across goal just wide of the far post. Soon France\u2019s hard work paid dividends, centre-back Kim Do-yeon, filling a gap left by Jang Sel-gi was robbed by Henry on the right and she raced clear finding Le Sommer with a perfectly weighted cut back to side foot in to send the excitable crowd wild. With a goal relieving the nerves the crowd seemed calmer. But the home side continued to push a jittery South Korean defence. On 29 minutes Les Bleues looked to have doubled their lead, but the first ever VAR referral of a Women\u2019s World Cup intervened. A short corner from Gaetane Thiney was pinged into the box by Henry, flicked across goal it fell behind Bathy but she hooked her leg back and volleyed in. The delighted French celebrations at the lovely finish were shortlived as Bathy was ruled offside. Less than 10 minutes later, though, and Bathy\u2019s defensive partner, domestically and internationally, Renard secured the second. Another Thiney corner from the right was lofted into space by the far post and an incoming 6ft 1in Renard headed powerfully past Kim. On the stroke of half time Renard scored another, this time a corner from the left was almost placed onto her head near the penalty spot and, with Hwang Bo-ram attempting to mark her, she powered the ball over the head of the defender and to the right of a stationary Kim. With the bookies\u2019 inclusion of Renard in their top-scorer odds looking decidedly less unlikely, the second half got under way. With complacency starting to drift into France\u2019s dominant performance the South Koreans carved out their best chance of the game. Another substitute Lee Min-a, almost looked confused at being played clean through between Renard and Bathy but she could only put her shot disappointingly wide of Sarah Bouhaddi\u2019s right-hand post. South Korea manager Yoon Deok-yeo apologised to their fans for the disappointing performance. \u201cIn Korea there are people that watched the match at a late hour so I would like to say sorry to the football fans in Korea,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s match showed how strong France is, I cannot pinpoint one player, many of the French players showed very aggressive performances in a good way. Especially on both wings, Cascarino and Diani, those player have great technique and they are very fast so it was very hard for my players to mark those players.\u201d The French were still in control, and Henry capped an commanding performance with a stunning effort. Picking up a pass from Le Sommer she pushed forward before slamming a swerving right-footed shot from 20 yards into the corner. France have underachieved at major competitions in the past decade, given the quality of their squad. But now, on home soil, there is a feeling that finally everything is clicking. And, with the chance to be the first country to hold both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cup\u2019s at the same time on the cards, this performance showed they are not letting the pressure get to them. \u201cWe\u2019ve won tonight\u2019s match but this is just one step on the road,\u201d tempered Diacre. \u201cWe have six more steps to take if we are to go all the way. We need to keep our feet on the ground and continue working.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
