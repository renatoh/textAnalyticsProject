Wrapped variously in the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes, they were determined to welcome the American president and confront anti-Bush protesters with their own inconsistencies. \"This is a head of state visit not a head of government visit\", observed one, a student from the London School of Economics. \"By protesting against the visit you're protesting against America not Bush himself and this protest is all about anti-Americanism. There was one protester with 666 on his forehead. \"It's important we register our approval and celebrate the visit. After all, everybody who's against Bush is out today, but everyone who agrees is just happily going about their lives.\" Talk to the (far more numerous) anti-Bush protesters and you'll hear the opposite, of course. The reason people stay at home is apathy, cultivated by a belief they won't be listened to by the powers that be. \"I'd rather be out here than sitting on my arse at home feeling nobody will listen\", says comedian Mark Thomas, a fervent critic of the Bush administration. \"The message won't get through if you don't come out and what 10 years of protest have taught us is that the things that unite us are far greater than those that divide us.\" What those things are exactly can sometimes not be immediately obvious. Standing on the corner of the Strand with a dinky video camera and a shiny mountain bike, Thomas is surrounded by placards calling for a free Palestine, those calling for Blair out, those announcing \"fuck Bush, fuck the causes of Bush\" and those calling for troops out of Iraq, and says \"I agree with them all.\" Others, like Ros Sweetman, see the plethora of causes joined in the one parade and disagree with many, but choose still to march. \"I find it a struggle to decide to march\", she says. \"Partly because I am a Quaker and I worry about the feeling of incipient violence at marches sometimes, but also because I don't agree with those who feel America is 'bad bad bad'. \"Really I am here to say that we across the world do not want to be dominated by one single power, and it's more important to be here with those aspects I don't agree with and make that point. It's about finding a common ground, and not worrying about how we might be seen by the media or the government. It's about caring enough to want to be seen.\" In holding that opinion alone, Ms Sweetman held common ground with the rock star Damon Albarn. Like Thomas he's an outspoken critic of President Bush and the war on Iraq, and he admits to doubts about the protest movement. \"On February 15 my biggest fear was that there was a tremendous turnout, but that it wasn't focused. I feel it's important that we find one coherent message, but that we'll only do that by reiterating our right to march. \"We need to work on our similarities instead of concentrating on our differences, and perhaps that's the message for our governments too. We're working on the similarities and they're working on the differences. With the reasons they gave for their actions in Iraq, no wonder.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
