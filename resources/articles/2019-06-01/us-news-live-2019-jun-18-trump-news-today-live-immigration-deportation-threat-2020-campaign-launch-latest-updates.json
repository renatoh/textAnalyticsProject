But my Guardian colleague Adam Gabbatt is about to fire up a special politics live blog from Orlando, Florida. He recently alighted there from the Guardian US base in New York to cover, with the help of a very focused team, Donald Trump\u2019s official 2020 reelection campaign launch. It\u2019s going to be a huge night. If you\u2019re a Trump fan, it\u2019s like Christmas in June. If you\u2019re not, well, don\u2019t look away from the difficult things....we\u2019ll have the right tone and sharp analysis, so stick around, we\u2019ll be right back. Early evening summary. It\u2019s already been a busy day in national politics, in particular. Former government ethics chief Walter Shaub has backed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s view that detaining undocumented migrants en masse at the border essentially creates \u201cconcentration camps\u201d. AOC has been in a row with conservatives, specifically Liz Cheney, since Donald Trump last night promised a new rash of mass deportations. The US Senate is one step closer to confirming ultra-conservative, anti-LGBT, anti-women\u2019s rights, religious zealot Matthew Kacsmaryk to a federal judgeship - a job for life. Acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan\u2019s departure is just the latest in the Trump administration to find the door hitting him on the way out. Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot blasts Trump while in NYC Chicago\u2019s new mayor, Lori Lightfoot, is visiting New York this week and is meeting today with city mayor Bill de Blasio and first lady Chirlane McCray. Their meeting has, in rather curmudgeonly fashion, this reporter thinks, been tersely described on official notices as \u201cclosed press\u201d, so we\u2019ll see if anything emerges. But Lightfoot wasn\u2019t pussy-footing around last night at the DNC LGBTQ gala in the Big Apple, blasting the Trump administration for its biased policies. \u201cTrump \u2014 behind his smoke screen of lies, insults and angry tweets \u2014 has pursued a dangerous agenda rolling back basic rights for LGBTQ+ families, troops and employees,\u201d she said in her speech. \u201cThey aim to reverse civil rights which you may have assumed were a matter of settled law.\u201d Personally, and the White House aside, Lightfoot was celebratory, remarking: \u201cOne month ago, I was inaugurated as Chicago\u2019s first openly gay mayor and our first black woman mayor. \u201cI was elected by a huge majority \u2014 74% \u2014 and I have to feel that the vote revealed a genuine sea change in public attitudes. None of this would have been possible a generation ago. It\u2019s still a bit stunning, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Walter Shaub, AOC, concentration camps In the ongoing row about migrant detention camps, former head of the independent Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, who quit the Trump administration in disgust, has weighed in behind Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez this afternoon. AOC last night and earlier today spoke of her outrage that the Trump administration is \u201ccreating concentration camps\u201d on the US-Mexico border to detain undocumented migrants, including children. Shaub just tweeted, and AOC retweeted. He mentions that he saw AOC among protesters at the since-closed Tornillo federal detention facility for migrant youth, which was an appalling bunch of tents in the desert near El Paso, Texas, that mushroomed in size over a matter of months last summer, as the Guardian revealed at the time. Shaub just termed it a \u201cchild concentration camp.\u201d The administration has opened more camps nearby since then, such as this one which was being readied just as the president was calling conditions for migrants crossing the border as \u201cDisneyland\u201d, despite much evidence otherwise. Acting... It looks dramatic when it\u2019s put in a list. MSNBC tots up the senior Trump administration posts currently being operated by an \u201cacting\u201d incumbent. In a sieve we\u2019ll go to sea! Patrick Shanahan\u2019s ousting is just the latest of dozens of senior figures to depart the high-turnover Trump administration. Trump\u2019s White House has had the highest senior-level staff churn rate of the past five presidents, according to figures compiled by the Brookings Institution, a think tank, Reuters reports this afternoon. Here are the most prominent - check out the Guardian\u2019s interactive, directly below. Other less famous names include: Kevin Hassett: Trump said on June 3 that the White House council of economic advisers chairman would leave his post. Randolph \u201cTex\u201d Alles, head of the US Secret Service, left in May as part of a broader shake-up of the Department of Homeland Security, shortly after Kirtsjen Nielsen\u2019s departure. Clete Willems: A key figure in trade talks with China and a deputy to Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow. Heather Wilson: The US Air Force secretary, once considered a top candidate to become defense secretary, returned to academia. Right-winger moves closer to federal judgeship Fiercely anti-LGBTQ, anti-marriage equality, anti-women\u2019s reproductive rights lawyer Matthew Kacsmaryk is one step closer to being handed a life-time appointment as a federal judge, after a vote in the US Senate. His final confirmation vote will be held tomorrow. Kacsmaryk 42, has ripped Roe v Wade, said abortion rights backers are \u201csexual revolutionaries\u201d + fought against LGBTQ protections in employment, housing + health care, HuffPost\u2019s Jennifer Bendery tweeted earlier today, describing the conservative religious zealot as \u201cone of Trump\u2019s most anti-LGBTQ, anti-abortion picks yet\u201d. Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin spoke out on Capitol Hill earlier, on the floor of the Senate, saying: \u201cIt strikes me as unusual, more than coincidental, that in June \u2013 the LGBTQ Pride Month \u2013 our Republican colleagues would decide to bring to the floor the nomination of a Texas district court nominee, Matthew J. Kacsmaryk\u2026 Mr. Kacsmaryk has not been shy about his hostility to marriage equality and transgender Americans,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cI oppose the Kacsmaryk nomination. This is yet another extreme nominee outside the mainstream of American thinking who does not deserve to be rubber-stamped for a lifetime appointment by the United States Senate.\u201d According to Durbin\u2019s Office, Kacsmaryk has \u201crepeatedly written in his personal capacity about his opposition to LGBTQ rights and the Obergefell case.\u201d In 2015 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled same-sex couples have the right to marry in the Obergefell case, Illinois local station KFVS reported. Kacsmaryk claims being transgender is a \u201cdelusion\u201d. Human Rights Campaign legal director Sarah Warbelow said Kacsmaryk \u201cfails a basic expectation of impartiality..HRC will continue to raise the alarm about Kacsmaryk and other nominees who refuse to protect the rights of all Americans.\u201d Chaos at the Pentagon - even McConnell is speaking out Now US Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who appears to pride himself on doing big things \u201clast minute\u201d (in the row over funding for those sickened by Ground Zero), has just said it \u201cwould be better to have a confirmed secretary of defense\u201d as the US confronts Iran, Reuters reports. Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said: \u201cThis is a very difficult time..to have no secretary of defense is appalling..every American should worry.\u201d The new acting defense secretary, as of about two and a half hours ago, is Mark Esper, currently secretary of the Army. He succeeds Patrick Shanahan who quit this morning. Shanahan was in the acting defense secretary role after defense secretary Jim Mattis resigned last December following acute and prolonged disagreements over policy with Donald Trump. When he hired Mattis, Trump was impressed by the marine veteran\u2019s bearing and his nickname \u201cMad Dog\u201d, but the relationship cooled as Mattis resisted Trump\u2019s inclination to distance the US from its Nato allies and blocked bellicose gestures aimed at North Korea in 2017. \u201cI think he\u2019s sort of a Democrat, if you want to know the truth,\u201d Trump told a TV interviewer in October. Former defence officials had said that Mattis saw his primary loyalty to the US constitution, and that had guided his relations with an erratic and acerbic president, our Julian Borger wrote at the time of Mattis\u2019s announced retirement. Early afternoon summary Orlando, Florida, Trump\u2019s base, the rest of us, rest of world, etc, braced for Donald Trump\u2019s official 2020 reelection campaign launch tonight. Reminder, Guardian US will be running a special live blog on this, from Orlando, from 5PM ET, with a live feed of Trump\u2019s speech at 8PM. Trump has promised mass deportations of \u201cmillions\u201d of undocumented immigrants from the US, beginning next week, a policy that has sown confusion and drawn skepticism as well as opprobrium from opponents. Acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan has withdrawn from the process to confirm a permanent defense secretary, amid doubts over background checks, turbulent personal life and reports of tricky relationship with Potus. Joe Biden held a successful fundraiser in New York City yesterday, at a financier\u2019s house, attended by a handful of Republicans. He announced his campaign for 2020 has already raised close to $20 million. Elizabeth Warren soon catapulted a proverbial donkey dropping into his eye in scorn. US markets rising on news that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping plan an \u201cextended meeting\u201d while at the G20 in Japan next week, amid the US-China trade war. Shanahan to resign Pentagon post WaPo\u2019s Josh Rogin tweets: US immigration fresh crackdown - not immediate CNN ace reporter Shimon Prokupecz has tweeted an update on the latest immigration threats/row/confusion. I\u2019ll let it speak for itself. This hours after Donald Trump whipped everyone up into a foam and sent a fresh tremor of fear through any undocumented person in the US by announcing an implausible new \u201cpolicy\u201d via Twitter: \u201cNext week ICE [immigration and customs enforcement] will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in.\u201d Shanahan: turbulent personal life Patrick Shanahan sat down with the Washington Post last night to talk about tricky things that he obviously knew would come out after he had to withdraw from consideration for defense sec. He explains that he now regrets defending actions by his son William after, as a 17-year-old, William beat his mother unconscious with a baseball bat, breaking her skull. Shanahan at the time wrote a memo to a relative where he described the actions as self defense by his son which, even though they would \u201clikely be viewed as an imbalance of force...Will\u2019s mother harassed him for nearly three hours before the incident\u201d. He told the Post on Monday night that he now regrets making that argument, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t believe violence is appropriate ever.\u201d The article goes on to detail extreme turbulence in his marriage to his ex-wife, and their family life. Joni Ernst: Shanahan\u2019s \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst, who has been stoically outspoken as a military veteran, a sexual assault survivor and an ambitious politician who nevertheless turned down an offer to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president has said Shanahan just did the right thing by withdrawing from the process to confirm a new US defense secretary. Fox\u2019s Chad Pergram notes that Ernst reacted to the Shanahan news by saying: \u201cHe\u2019s doing the right thing he needs to do and I support him\u201d. That sounds a tiny bit like a Nancy Pelosi clap.... Back story: Patrick Shanahan tells all to WashPo The Washington Post pressed the button to launch this story at 12.58PM ET today, one minute ahead of the time logged when Donald Trump announced Shanahan\u2019s withdrawal from the process to find his forever home at the Pentagon. It\u2019s pretty raw, beginning: In the months that he has served as President Trump\u2019s acting secretary of defense, Patrick Shanahan has worked to keep domestic violence incidents within his family private. His wife was arrested after punching him in the face, and his son was arrested after a separate incident in which he hit his mother with a baseball bat. Public disclosure of the nearly decade-old episodes would re-traumatize his young adult children, Shanahan said. On Tuesday, Trump announced in a tweet that Shanahan would not be going through with the nomination process, which had been delayed by an unusually lengthy FBI background check, \u201cso that he can devote more time to his family.\u201d Shanahan spoke publicly about the incidents in interviews with The Washington Post on Monday and Tuesday. \u201cBad things can happen to good families . . . and this is a tragedy, really,\u201d Shanahan said. Dredging up the episode publicly, he said, \u201cwill ruin my son\u2019s life.\u201d Shanahan out amid questions over his relationship with Trump, personal life, FBI background check Patrick Shanahan\u2019s elevation to the permanent post of defense secretary, from acting, had been the subject of a baffling delay. Just yesterday it was reported that various outlets had questioned his relationship with the president, and the Pentagon has been fielding press queries about his personal life, including a messy divorce that involved an accusation of domestic violence from his ex-wife, who was arrested as part of the dispute, Yahoo news wrote. As late as that report yesterday, Shanahan did not respond to requests for comment on this story. The Pentagon referred questions from Yahoo to a spokesperson for Shanahan, who emphasized the personal nature of the allegations. Despite announcing more than a month ago that Shanahan was his pick to get the job, Trump had yet to nominate him formally, forcing the Senate Armed Services committee to postpone a confirmation hearing it had tentatively scheduled for today. Donald Trump just announced that Patrick Shanahan will not be confirmed as secretary of defense, names secretary of the Army, Mark Esper, as new acting defense sec. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo address tensions with Iran during remarks at Centcom (United States Central Command, part of the Pentagon) reiterating last night\u2019s announcement that the US is sending 1,000 additional troops to the Middle East \u201cto deter [Iran] from further aggression in the region\u201d. Here\u2019s a clip via ABC TV on Twitter. California Democratic Rep Barbara Lee notes \u201conce more for people in the back\u201d that Trump and Pompeo can\u2019t go to war \u201cwithout congressional approval. The administration is looking to pressure the clerical regime, not fight it, but the groundwork is being laid for a \u201cpossible confrontation\u201d with Iran, Politico writes. In international trade news, stock prices are sharply higher on Wall Street this lunchtime following news that the leaders of the US and China will meet face-to-face next week at the G20 summit to discuss their long-running trade dispute. Technology and industrial companies, which would benefit the most from easing trade tensions, rose more than the rest of the market, the AP reports. Apple climbed 2.4% and heavy-duty equipment maker Caterpillar added 2.5%. European markets jumped after the head of the European Central Bank said it was ready to cut interest rates if necessary. The S&amp;P 500 index rose 30 points, or 1%, to 2,919. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 327 points, or 1.2%, to 26,437. The Nasdaq rose 120 points, or 1.5%, to 7,965. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.05%. For a summary of previous business news from across the globe, take a glance at our business live blog \u201cas it happened\u201d recap out of the Guardian\u2019s London HQ, also coverage of Donald Trump accusing the European Central Bank of unfairly manipulating the euro. It\u2019s Fox on Joe Biden so it must be true Typo notwithstanding: Joe Biden draws Republicans to fundraiser Democratic 2020 front-runner Joe Biden held a fundraiser in New York City last night. He\u2019s doing three more today in the Big App today. Biden suggested that his presidential campaign has taken in close to $20 million already, the Washington Post writes this morning, offering a glimpse of his fundraising prowess in the early stages of the crowded Democratic primary. Biden says he\u2019s raised money from 360,000 donors, with an average contribution of $55. Last night\u2019s event was at the Upper East Side home of Jim Chanos, president and founder of Kynikos Associates, a prominent short-selling investment firm, Politico mentioned in its morning newsletter, going off of a reporting pool dispatch from the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Ken Thomas. He writes that: \u201cPrior to Mr Biden\u2019s arrival, around 6 p.m., about two dozen climate change demonstrators gathered outside.\u201d Reporters (but not protesters) were ushered into the penthouse apartment, where \u2018guests mingled, sipped wine and chatted at an adjoining outdoor terrace. Artwork lined the walls of the apartment. Biden said he appreciated the donors for \u201cwriting a check to allow me to compete...nationally\u201d. \u2018Guests spotted by the pool included: Former Senator Al D\u2019Amato, Republican of New York, Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney, former Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, who served as a VA undersecretary for health during the Obama administration and says he was fired as VA secretary by Trump in 2018; [grocery store billionaire and former Republican candidate for city mayor] John Catsimatidis, and other prominent Democratic fundraisers. Half an hour later, 2020 rival and the leading woman in the race, Elizabeth Warren, zinged out an email to observers and supporters saying: \u201cI don\u2019t spend time at fancy fundraisers. Instead, I spend my time meeting voters and thanking grassroots donors who chip in what they can. Donate $3 to my campaign, and you might just get a call from me to thank you!\u201d AOC accuses Trump of operating \u201cconcentration camps\u201d at the border Look, I know, Google Calendar is down. You don\u2019t know where you\u2019re supposed to be, doing what. Nothing for it but to dive into the social media storm that\u2019s blown up in a Bermuda Triangle of recrimination and confusion involving New York Democratic Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Wyoming Republican Rep Liz Cheney and....her Dad, Dick...no, wait, I mean her president, Donald. It\u2019s awful. Here goes. We\u2019ll kick off with AOC\u2019s latest riposte to Liz and work backwards. Ocasio-Cortez posted a video to Instagram last night, also accessible here via Twitter, in which she accused the Trump administration of creating concentration camps in which to detain migrants who have crossed the border unlawfully, while they are processed and, increasingly, swiftly dispatched back across to Mexico even if they are claiming asylum from suffering in their home countries, especially Central America. \u201cThe US is running concentration camps on our southern border, that\u2019s exactly what they are,\u201d she says. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t bother you...I do not, I like, okay, whatever,\u201d she says, shrugging in exasperation. \u201cNever again means something,\u201d she says, and points out that such rounding-up and detention \u201cin the land of the free\u201d is extraordinarily disturbing. Cue Twitter tempest over the echoes of the Holocaust, implied parallel between Trump and Hitler, anti-semitism, even mentions of Abu Ghraib...it\u2019s vicious and unfiltered from both sides of the argument. Liz Cheney Trump and Xi meeting \u201chadn\u2019t been officially scheduled\u201d More on that report, after Trump said he had a \u201cvery good\u201d telephone conversation with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping and said the two leaders would have an \u201cextended meeting\u201d later this month in Japan. The meeting, which hadn\u2019t officially been scheduled, is aimed at repairing relations between the two countries and easing tensions over trade, the Wall Street Journal writes, adding that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up more than 300 points in recent trading. The two countries have been embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade dispute since last year and had hoped to reach a deal, but talks faltered in May, with the US blaming China for reneging on its promises in the eleventh hour of discussions. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is scheduled to testify on the president\u2019s trade policy in a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee Tuesday morning.\u2019 Germany\u2019s Merkel listening to US on Iran - at least with one ear German Chancellor Angela Merkel says her country is taking \u201cvery seriously\u201d the new US information about Iran\u2019s alleged responsibility for attacks last week on two oil tankers near the Persian Gulf. Merkel says \u201cthere\u2019s a high-level of evidence. But that won\u2019t stop me from saying we have to do everything to solve the conflict situation with Iran in a peaceful manner.\u201d Iran denies the US accusation, the AP writes. She says Germany \u201cwill do everything to impress on all sides, but especially to make clear to Iran, that this serious situation mustn\u2019t be aggravated.\u201d Merkel also says Germany wants Iran to abide by the 2015 nuclear accord, [agreed by Barack Obama and abandoned by Donald Trump], adding that \u201cif that isn\u2019t the case that will of course have consequences.\u201d Meanwhile, China\u2019s top diplomat has warned the United States against opening a \u201cPandora\u2019s box\u201d in the Middle East after the recent flare-up in tension between Washington and Tehran. Foreign Minister Wang Yi is calling on both countries to avoid escalating the situation. In a further US foreign policy development, the Guardian\u2019s David Smith and Julian Borger report today that Iran has declared it \u201cwill not wage war against any nation\u201d after the US announced that a further 1,000 troops are to be sent to the Middle East amid rising tensions. That full report here. They socked it to him. Before Air Force One touches down in their backyard later today, with Potus, Flotus and Veep preparing to launch his reelection campaign, the big Orlando local daily paper isn\u2019t mincing its words. \u2018Donald Trump is in Orlando to announce the kickoff of his re-election campaign. We\u2019re here to announce our endorsement for president in 2020, or, at least, who we\u2019re not endorsing: Donald Trump,\u2019 the Orlando Sentinel writes today. The editorial continues: \u2018Some readers will wonder how we could possibly eliminate a candidate so far before an election, and before knowing the identity of his opponent. Because there\u2019s no point pretending we would ever recommend that readers vote for Trump. After 2\u00bd years we\u2019ve seen enough. Enough of the chaos, the division, the schoolyard insults, the self-aggrandizement, the corruption, and especially the lies. So many lies \u2014 from white lies to whoppers \u2014 told out of ignorance, laziness, recklessness, expediency or opportunity. Trump\u2019s capacity for lying isn\u2019t the surprise here, though the frequency is. It\u2019s the tolerance so many Americans have for it. There was a time when even a single lie \u2014 a phony college degree, a bogus work history \u2014 would doom a politician\u2019s career.\u2019 There\u2019s a LOT more to digest. 2020 Democrats respond to Trump threat Following the president\u2019s loud-hailer announcement last night about mass deportations of those in the US unlawfully, candidates for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination for president have begun to weight in. Texas\u2019s Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s succinct take on Twitter was: \u201cMilitarizing and raiding our communities makes us less, nor more, safe\u201d, prompting a reply from one person out there describing himself as a \u201cstaunch conservative\u201d, who said: \u201cMr O\u2019Rourke...I must say I agree with you on this.\u201d New York mayor and 2020 wannabe (despite lack of support for the idea in the Big Apple itself) Bill de Blasio tweeted his response this morning, with a link to an article about undocumented people working for Trump. Washington State governor and climate action champion Jay Inslee tweeted: \u201cDonald Trump kicks off his re-election campaign just like he launched his first run - with a racist attack on immigrants meant to divide us.\u201d And Steve Bullock, the Democratic governor of Montana, tweeted: \u201cWe will not let him use cruel threats to divide us.\u201d That sounds great when you first hear it but, when I think about it for two seconds, brings to mind flinging drawing pins at the backside of a bull elephant. Potus has tweeted that he and China\u2019s president Xi Jinping just got off the phone. Trump and Stephen Miller wave \u201crocket docket\u201d If you\u2019re a true believer, giving a hardline policy an offensive moniker is, obviously, hilarious. So, apparently, this new twist on US immigration policy that even lapdogs Kirstjen Nielsen and Ron Vitiello couldn\u2019t stomach is called the \u201crocket docket\u201d, the Washington Post reports today, conjuring images of speed, power and scorched earth in the president\u2019s haste to get on with raids that break up families and will damage the US economy. \u2018Trump and his senior immigration adviser, Stephen Miller (architect of the original Trump travel ban), have been prodding Homeland Security officials to arrest and remove thousands of family members whose deportation orders were expedited by the Justice Department this year as part of a plan known as the \u201crocket docket.\u201d In April, acting ICE director Ronald Vitiello and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen were ousted after they hesitated to go forward with the plan, expressing concerns about its preparation, effectiveness and the risk of public outrage from images of migrant children being taken into custody or separated from their families,\u2019 the Post writes. \u2018US officials with knowledge of the preparations have said in recent days that the operation was not imminent, and ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] officials said late Monday night that they were not aware that the president planned to divulge their enforcement plans on Twitter. Executing a large-scale operation of the type under discussion requires hundreds \u2014 and perhaps thousands \u2014 of US agents and supporting law enforcement personnel, as well as weeks of intelligence gathering and planning to verify addresses and locations of individuals targeted for arrest. The president\u2019s claim that ICE would be deporting \u201cmillions\u201d also was at odds with the reality of the agency\u2019s staffing and budgetary challenges. ICE arrests in the US interior have been declining in recent months because so many agents are busy managing the record surge of migrant families across the southern border with Mexico.\u2019 Trump\u2019s fresh threat of mass deportations sows confusion And, in opposition quarters, scorn and revulsion. The prospect of him really going off on another prejudiced mega-rant tonight is making me queasy. After tweeting last night that \u201cThey will be removed as fast as they come in,\u201d he gave no further details. That would appear to indicate migrants who have recently crossed the US-Mexico border. But an administration official told the Associated Press that the effort would focus on the more than a million people who have been issued final deportation orders by federal judges but remain at large in the country. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to explain the president\u2019s tweets. It is unusual for law enforcement agencies to announce raids before they take place. Some in the Trump administration believe that decisive shows of force \u2014 like mass arrests \u2014 can serve as effective deterrents, sending a message to those considering making the journey to the US, from Central America and beyond, that it\u2019s not worth coming. Trump threatens swift mass deportations of undocumented immigrants; policy document known as \u201cthe rocket docket\u201d Let\u2019s begin with Trump\u2019s tweets from last night. And he adds: Camping out - the base \u2018With tents, sleeping bags and coolers of water in tow, Donald Trump supporters began lining up early Monday for today\u2019s campaign rally in Orlando, nearly two full days before the event, the Orlando Sentinel daily newspaper reports this morning. Outside the Amway Center, where President Trump will officially kick off his 2020 re-election bid at 8 p.m., about two dozen people and counting had staked out a spot along Division Street as of Monday morning. The line had grown to about 50 as of 3 p.m. By 9:30 p.m., the line ballooned to about 250, with people snaked around to Central Boulevard. Around the same time, Trump tweeted there were \u201cthousands of people already lined up.\u201d \u201cThis is the big one,\u201d said Jennifer Petito, 54, of Melbourne, [Florida]. \u201cThis is the mother of all rallies.\u201d Petitio, who was wearing a pink \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d hat and a red-and-white striped fanny pack [your Guardian reporter\u2019s note for our UK readers: translation of this abominable and abominably-titled item = bumbag], was second in line. She said she got there around 2 a.m. \u2014 42 hours before the rally\u2019s start. The Amway has capacity for about 20,000 people. Trump tweeted Monday that there had been more than 100,000 requests for tickets, and that large screens and food trucks would be on hand for those who can\u2019t get inside.\u2019 The Guardian can\u2019t help noticing the discrepancy in the statistics. Remember, Trump said thousands of members of the public came out to cheer him in London earlier this month. The biggest crowds were actually thousands of demonstrators, jeering. Good Tuesday morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s American politics live blog. It\u2019s going to be a lively day and I\u2019ll be taking you up to 5pm east coast time with all the events and analysis. Then Guardian US is kicking off a special live blog from Orlando with my colleague Adam Gabbatt as the team prepares to cover the president\u2019s official 2020 campaign launch, with live stream. Donald Trump launches his 2020 re-election campaign tonight and has performed his own curtain-raiser by threatening via Twitter last night to begin deporting \u201cmillions of illegal aliens\u201d from the US. The pledge has caused nothing but confusion, however, as the logistics of this are virtually impossible, and such policies are usually kept secret anyway. Our politics chief David Smith previews tonight\u2019s event and its significance in this piece today on \u201cvulnerable Trump\u201d. Trump\u2019s base has been flocking from far and wide to the campaign event in Orlando, where Trump\u2019s speech begins at 8pm EDT. We\u2019ll be live streaming it as well as live blogging the event and reporting from in and around the arena in this swing area of a swing state. More decisions are awaited from the US Supreme Court in its traditional June outpouring of decisions. Most breathlessly: the issue of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census and a battle over gerrymandering. And \u2026 what happened at that Joe Biden fundraiser last night?
