They like chopping it, stacking it, making a fire with it, and tending the fire. They discuss axes. They argue about whether wood should be stored with the bark underneath or uppermost \u2013 a question not yet settled (questions take a long time to get settled in Norway). So what could be more natural than a 12-hour television programme about firewood, of which eight hours featured just a log fire quietly burning away, with the occasional sputter as new fuel was added or a discreet toasting fork with a marshmallow on it appeared on the screen? A fifth of the population tuned in last week when Norwegian state television broadcast the programme. Some described it as exciting. Others thought it provocative, because of stacking mistakes. Britain has been traumatised by The Killing and gripped by Borgen. Are we ready for a different Scandinavian experience, reintroducing us to the pleasure of simple things ?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
