The rally in London, organised by probation and family court staff union Napo, was called to protest the formation of a new National Offenders Management Service (NOMS). The government says NOMS will provide a single system to punish offenders and reduce re-offending, but Medway Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews told the rally that NOMS rejected the idea that the best way to deal with offenders was through rehabilitation rather than punishment and imprisonment. He said he was bitterly opposed to the new plans. He said: \"Not primarily because it will create a bureaucratic nightmare, not even primarily because of any gross aversions to privatisation, which I have, but because it portrays a grave and single departure from principle. \"The retreat from that principle to an offenders management service is a ghastly Orwellian idea.\" Support for the campaign against NOMS also came at the rally from Conservative shadow Home Office minister Cheryl Gillan and Liberal Democrat shadow home secretary Mark Oaten. The Napo general secretary, Judy McKnight, told the rally: \"Today our fight is not just about wanting to preserve our standards, ethos and values. It is also about opposing the destruction of the service in its entirety by splitting it up and spitting it out.\" Ms McKnight said that under the new plans deep divisions would be created between those dealing with offenders and those concentrating on rehabilitation. Probation officers are not only worried about the changes leading to more bureaucracy and confusion, but about the partial privatisation of the service. Speakers at the rally pointed out the probation service was only reorganised three years ago and the changes implemented had not had a chance to \"bed down\". Harry Fletcher, Napo assistant general secretary, said he was delighted by the protest. He said: \"It is an excellent turnout with well over 1,000 staff from all parts of England and Wales pledging their support for the parliamentary criticisms of NOMS \"The details about NOMS remain as vague as ever. There is still no news on employer status, terms and conditions, training, professional development or any other matter of vital importance. \"Both the probation and prison service budgets remain in crisis, workloads are excessive and morale low.\" However, NOMS chief executive Martin Narey, said a radical overhaul of services was needed to reduce the rate of re-offending, and that the new service had the support of most staff. He said: \"Often offenders fall through the gap between the two services. Probation officers and prison officers see this practically every day. \"I understand concerns about change but the creation of NOMS is a huge opportunity to change radically for the better how we work with offenders and break the cycle of re-offending. \"I am absolutely certain that the vast majority of probation and prison officers want to grasp this opportunity with both hands.\" Prisons and probation minister Paul Goggins said: \"We are determined to work closely with staff and the trade unions at every stage of the creation of NOMS to ensure that we build the best possible organisation.\" A lobby of parliament following the rally urged MPs to sign an early day motion opposing NOMS."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
