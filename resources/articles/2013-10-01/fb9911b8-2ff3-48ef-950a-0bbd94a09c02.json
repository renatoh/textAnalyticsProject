In a survey of its members, manufacturers' group the EEF found that 85% who expressed a preference said they would vote to remain within the EU. Its chief executive, Terry Scuoler, has written to David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, calling on them to focus on making the European single market work better, rather than flirting with EU exit. Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should continue to be an EU member by the end of 2017, and Labour is considering whether to include a similar pledge in its general election manifesto. But Scuoler said: \"Britain must not gamble on its future in Europe. The stakes are enormous. It is naive to think we can simply pull up the drawbridge and carry on as normal. The debate must move on to how we can make Europe work to support jobs, growth and higher living standards.\" EEF members said there was a significant chance that they would shift investment and employment plans in the event that Britain left the EU, while 60% said the government should focus on enhancing competitiveness across the single market, rather than negotiating opt-outs from specific Brussels regulations. Coalition ministers are encouraging Britain's businesses to look to fast-growing emerging markets as part of a drive to double exports to \u00a31tn a year by 2020; but the EU still buys around half of UK exports. \"The clear message from manufacturers, who employ millions in the UK, is that we must lead on this and play an active part in shaping the EU from within.\" George Osborne sees an industrial revival as central to generating a sustainable recovery, and the EEF's intervention took place as forecasting group the EY Item Club issued an optimistic prognosis for the economy over the next two years. In its quarterly forecast, published on Monday, EY predicted GDP growth of 1.4% in 2013 and 2.4% next year, as businesses respond to improved consumer confidence and the uptick in the housing market by bringing forward investment plans. Item's Peter Spencer, the report's author, said: \"The boost from the consumer has pushed the UK economy into a progressively higher orbit, but this now needs to be supplemented by a thrust from the engines of export and investment.\" EY said there was little risk of a new housing market bubble and described the government's controversial Help to Buy scheme as \"well timed and targeted\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
