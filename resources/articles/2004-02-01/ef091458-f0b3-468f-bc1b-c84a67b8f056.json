Not, fortunately, that it ever came to that for me, as I was able to hurl abuse at the palmOne Zire 21 in the comfort of my office rather than attracting attention on a dark, foreign street while struggling with my luggage. Within a couple of hours, though, I'd calmed down enough to vaguely enjoy using it, which suggests this might be a feasible buy if you try it at the beginning of your flight rather than when you get off at the other end. In fact, it's sensible enough to instantly bung some airport info on your screen as soon as your city guide is loaded. For London, it all seemed accurate enough, if perhaps sacrificing the odd essential tip for brevity, such as buying a ticket before you get on the Heathrow Express, that might have saved the user a couple of quid. Still, if you've shelled out for one of these rather than a guidebook, perhaps you don't need it. On the up side, the Zire is a lot cheaper than handhelds used to be. It's extremely light, and for the frequent city traveller, bulk buying the downloads (at $49.99 for 20 rather than $19.99 each) might make sense. I liked the maps, and most sections seemed to give a good overview even if others were bewildering: one of the 10 headline choices, Play, led straight into tennis and horseriding, hardly the first priority of most travellers, I'd suspect. Occasionally the navigation was downright infuriating; possibly it has a logic regular Palm users understand. You don't have to be a technophobe to long for a trusty old book, though it helps. There's undoubtedly some useful information here, but if you're not already in the handheld club, this probably isn't reason enough to start. Lonely Planet CitySync guides can be downloaded from Handango.com for $19.99 each. The palmOne Zire 21 costs \u00a379 (RRP)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
