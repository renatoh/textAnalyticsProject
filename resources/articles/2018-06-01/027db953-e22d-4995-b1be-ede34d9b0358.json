The manager was encouraged to hear Dele Alli and others publicly state their belief that England are capable of reaching the final in Moscow against the odds \u2013 and even winning it. \u201cWhy would I limit what they feel is possible?\u201d Southgate said. \u201cMy job is to allow people to dream. Make the impossible seem possible. None of us are going to get excited or get out of bed just for getting out of the group. They are at an age and have hunger, enthusiasm and no little quality so they can certainly keep improving. \u201cWe have got to improve to reach the latter stages of a tournament and that is going to take a lot of work over the next few weeks and a huge commitment. But I am seeing evidence that they\u2019re embracing that challenge.\u201d England are not only one of the youngest in the tournament \u2013 only France and Nigeria have younger squads \u2013 they have the fewest caps of any squad. The average number of England appearances is 20 compared with 34 per player across all the squads. Southgate acknowledged concerns about a lack of experience but claimed it was outweighed by the benefits. \u201cThat\u2019s allowing us to create an environment where they\u2019re actually having a go at things we\u2019re asking them to do,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I think: \u2018They\u2019re never going to go for this.\u2019 They\u2019re at times painstakingly putting up with some of the things I throw their way so, that I think, would be more difficult with older players. \u201cThey\u2019d possibly be a little less malleable and a little less open to new suggestions, but they really are having a go at everything and they are keen to show people how much it means to them to play for England.\u201d If optimism and openness alone could win games, England would breeze through the group stage on the basis of their performances in front of the media in the past week. The manager praised Danny Rose for speaking publicly about his battle with depression. He has encouraged the squad to tell their backstories to each other to improve cohesion on the pitch but also to improve the public image of the team. \u201cWe\u2019re asking them to open up quite a bit on their own feelings about things,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed the possible situation over racism, which was certainly an important connection between the team. It\u2019s not a comfortable space for us to be at times but it helps to build a togetherness. You get a closer connection. \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken at length this week about how we\u2019re really proud to represent everybody but really the guy next to you is the most important one going into this tournament. You\u2019ve got to be there for him, you\u2019ve got to support him, you\u2019ve got to be available when he needs to pass the ball to you and you\u2019ve got to be covering his back if he slips or makes a mistake and that\u2019s what we want to engender.\u201d The 47-year-old urged his side to forget about the past and make history in Russia. He has discussed with his players comments made by Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard about bitter inter\u2011club rivalries destroying the spirit within England camps at previous tournaments. \u201cWe have listened to compelling interviews from Rio and Frank and Steven and we\u2019ve used those to say we\u2019ve got to make sure we put those club situations to one side but I don\u2019t think there is that intense rivalry at the moment between our top clubs that there was then,\u201d he said. \u201cThe past can help us and inform us but it shouldn\u2019t shape us and we\u2019ve got to be our own team. \u201cThis is a diverse team with different sets of skills and they\u2019ve got a chance to make their own history. Whenever you\u2019re in an England shirt you have an opportunity to make history.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
