And now sources connected with the programme admit it may be too controversial to be broadcast at all. \"It is causing huge ructions within the BBC. There is no rush to get it out,\" said a source. The animated sitcom, in which a manic Pope voiced by Ruby Wax bounces around the Vatican on a pogo stick, has had hordes of complaints ever since it was unveiled as a proposed programme 15 months ago. The row over the series - estimated to be costing \u00a32.5 million - was reignited today after human rights campaigner James Mawdsley vowed to boycott the licence fee and risk going to jail over the show. His case was highlighted on the Today programme this morning after Catholic commentator Clifford Longley accused the BBC of trying to incite ill-feeling towards the 6 million Catholics in the country. A spokeswoman said the Popetown name may now be dropped as a result of the criticism - another title being mooted is \"Holy Smoke\" - but some insiders suggested the series was so controversial it may never be broadcast. \"There is never going to be a good time to put this out,\" said a source close to the programme. \"The whole point about these complaints is that none of the people making them have seen the scripts, but if they did they would be hugely upset.\" Popetown was originally due to be broadcast on BBC3 last autumn. The BBC now says it will go out later this year - although this is not guaranteed - and will then transfer to BBC2. The 10-part sitcom is set in an office and focuses on its politics and the infantile boss, the Pope. It also features Jerry Hall as Sister Penelope, the \"Popetown TV reporter\" and Brass Eye's Kevin Eldon, who plays a cleric trying to make Popetown successful despite the sinister cardinals and Vatican bureaucracy. Also in the series are the voices of Bob Mortimer, The Office star MacKenzie Crook and the Little Britain and Shooting Stars comedian Matt Lucas. The controversy comes at a time when the BBC is extraordinarily sensitive to accusations of impartiality in the wake of the Hutton report, and days after a section of Radio 4 sitcom Absolute Power was cut after it implied Tony Blair was a liar. Mr Mawdsley, who spent 14 months of a life sentence in solitary confinement in Burman to highlight rights abuses, told the Catholic Herald: \"I wrote to the BBC to say I will not pay the licence fee so long as they threaten to mock my religion. \"They politely replied that I risk prosecution. I will not pay the \u00a31,000 fine,so that means prison. Never mind.\" The BBC has already come under fire for its \"rudeness and prejudice\" in its coverage of the Roman Catholic church. The Archbishop of Glasgow, speaking in the wake of the Hutton report, said the corporation was guilty of encouraging a \"tabloid culture\" - and expressed particular concern about Popetown. Last October the Archbishop of Birmingham attacked a string of BBC programmes including a Kenyon Confronts investigation into clerical child abuse as \"biased and hostile\". His case was also highlighted today by Longley in the Thought for the Day slot on Radio 4. \"The cartoon characterises the cardinals in the Vatican as sinister and corrupt, and the pope as revoltingly childish and silly, \" said Longley. \"The BBC cannot have grasped the full implications of this. Very simply, if you insult the leadership of the Catholic church like this, you insult all Catholics - including the 6 million who live in the UK, and you hold them up for public hatred, ridicule and contempt,\" he added. Speaking on the Today programme, Longley called on different religions to unite in opposition to the show. \"It would be good for Jewish and Muslim leaders to stand up for Catholics for one and speak out against this... to warn the BBC to permit the broadcast of an inflammatory and defamatory series ridiculing the Pope would be a mistake.\" A BBC spokeswoman said the programme, which is being made by independent production company Channel X, was still in production and \"nowhere near a transmission date yet\". She said \"several thousand\" complaints had been received so far, while more than 6,000 Roman Catholics signed a petition against the show last year. \"We are constantly talking to various people, including the Catholic church, on this programme - as we do about all our programmes. It was commissioned an awfully long time ago and is still in the pipeline. Popetown is only a working title. We will take on board what people say.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
