Very well, thanks, Small Talk, and you? Could be worse. We hear you're on your way to South Africa with the Bobby Moore Fund. Why? It's something they've been doing for years. Ordinary people can sign up to raise about three or four thousand pounds and you go out there and try to improvise the lives of some unfortunate people. I'm going out to help refurbish a school and build an additional classroom for kids that have it tough. Other people will be doing other things. It's all positive stuff and hopefully lots of people doing little things will add up to a big help. Good, good. On an entirely different subject, Small Talk heard something a while back about you putting a team together to take part in the Le Mans rally, is that still on the agenda? It certainly is. As usual with these things it's about raising the finance. It's not an easy one but it's something worthwhile, if you look at it from an ethnic and sporting point of view, there aren't many people like me who've raced at Le Mans. Indeed. Have you always been interested in motor racing? Yes, since I was young, when I used to help my father do repairs and that sort of thing. Later I got an opportunity to take it further and actually race cars. I've been a big follower of Formula One, the Touring Car Championship and GT racing for a long time. Why a Le Mans team as opposed to, say, an F1 team? There's no way at my age that I could compete at F1 with the fitness and everything involved. F1 drivers are a very small and unique club. The next best thing would be Touring Cars but again those guys are elite professional drivers. So the next best thing after that is endurance racing \u2013 that gives us lesser mortals half a chance of competing. At the Le Mans series the average race time is about six hours and you go around at about 80-85% of your capacity as opposed to doing 100% every lap. Are you still involved in football? Yes. I've done my coaching qualifications and at the moment I'm with Stevenage Borough, coaching eight to 18 year-olds as the head of the centre of excellence. There are one or two other options with Kick it Out!, who do coaching in schools and I'm looking to get involved in that and maybe try to get into coaching back in the professional game. I've already had one or two conversations. Do the youngsters you coach know about your glorious playing days? No. Sometimes their parents will say 'this guy did this and that' and with the internet now they can research all that stuff, so they then come to me and ask questions about it. We'll chat about it sometimes because I'm there to try to give them the benefit of my experience. What tends to be their first question? What was it like playing for England and Milan? The next one, unfortunately, is always 'how much money did you make?' How do you answer? I tell them the money is secondary to actually playing and doing a good job. As long as you enjoy it and work hard the rewards will come later. You try to get them off this idea that they'll get a pot of gold as soon as they start playing football. But that's society at the moment: money, money, money. We all need it, but it's not the be-all and end-all. Graham Taylor comes across as a nice guy these days, but apparently back in his Watford days, he could unleash brutal bollockings \u2026 Oh yes, absolutely. You talk about Sir Alex Ferguson's hairdryer but the fact is that most managers who've achieved things have got their own way of delivering those bollickings and making sure you know when you haven't performed. Graham could do that in no uncertain times, sometimes in a very nice way, sometimes in a more ferocious way. Was he the best manager you worked under? I'd have to say yes. His attention to details \u2013 the thing most people would overlook - was fantastic and his knowledge of the game and the things he demanded from you were brilliant. He never asked people to do things they weren't capable of but he would coax whatever was in you out so that you could be as good as possible. Why didn't things work out for you at Milan? I look back at it as a great learning thing for me. I went from a club [Watford] that had finished second to Liverpool, where we won most of the games we played so to go to Milan was difficult: they were a big club with a big name, great stadium and great support, but we didn't have the players to back it up. [Franco] Baresi was the only world-class player we had, everyone else was just making up the numbers. If you don't have the players, it doesn't matter what the club is called, you won't achieve much. So you were happy to leave after just one season? Yes and no. In the end I wanted to get back to playing football that I could enjoy. For me being positive is about going out and attacking the opposition. The style of football in Italy was very defensive \u2013 it's hard to score goals if the ball is always in your own half. On the other hand, I would have liked to settle more into the Italian way of life, because the training and the preparation were fantastic. I still live by a lot of the things I learned there. But at the end of the day it's all about what happens on the pitch, so I came back. It seems you haven't been forgotten there, however. What did you make of the anarchic cult that sprung up around you? My attitude was 'I'm there to play football and what other people do is quite irrelevant to me'. It's something that was outside my control so unless it was causing me a problem in my day-to-day life, then I can just just ignore it. It never really impacted on me in any way. It certainly didn't bother me. Tell us this, Luther, what is your earliest memory? I was born in Jamaica and came to England when I was five. I remember being with my brothers, sisters and other family members where we lived near Montego Bay. Beautiful nature, warm weather, water to drink, fruit growing on trees, always outdoors. I remember the freedom. Happy days, eh. Now then, if you had your own chat show, who would you invite to be your first guest? Easy \u2013 Halle Berry. And I'd be quite happy to just sit there and look at her! And if you could be a superhero, which one would you be? Somebody like Superman, because there would be so much good you could do with your powers, such as preventing disasters and that type of thing. Not to mention thwarting a villain named Luther \u2026 Ha! Good point. Finally, what's your favourite TV show? I love science fiction, always been a big fan of Star Trek and that sort of thing. I know they're not real but I deal with real life every day so why would I want to come home and watch it on TV? I watch TV for entertainment. But also I want things that trigger my imagination and get me thinking about things in different ways. Out of people's incredible imaginations have come lots of very good things for our world. Actually, that wasn't the last question. This one is: can you tell us a joke? No, I'm rubbish at jokes. You tell me the best joke in the world and I'll ruin it! Not to worry, Luther, it's been a pleasure. Thanks for your time. Bye! Bye Small Talk. There are still spaces available to join Project South Africawith the Bobby Moore Fund.
