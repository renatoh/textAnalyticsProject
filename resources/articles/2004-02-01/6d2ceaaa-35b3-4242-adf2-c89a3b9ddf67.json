Norma Chatt, whose 81-year-old mother spent more than a year on Rowan ward at Withington hospital in Greater Manchester, said today:\"I want the people responsible brought to justice, that is what all the relatives want. What use is an apology nearly two years later?\" She claimed her mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, suffered six black eyes while on the ward. She said: \"When all the relatives got together and compared what had been going on it was awful. There were reports of patients being scalded, not being fed and having soap put in their mouths.\" The call for prosecutions comes a day after a report into the inquiry by the mental health trust, which was responding to a damning inspection last year of care standards on the ward by the Commission for Health Improvement (Chi). Chi inspectors found poor management and supervision and low staffing levels. The inquiry report revealed patients with dementia, schizophrenia and depression on Rowan ward were kicked, slapped and beaten by staff. It concluded standards of nursing care were outdated, doctors failed to report patients injuries, systems to detect abuse were poor and there was a culture of \"intimidation and even fear\" among staff on the ward. However the report failed to single out who was to blame for the injuries and concluded they were \"unattributable\". Greater Manchester police said today that it had conducted an investigation but that its file was closed last September. A spokeswoman said: \"Following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service no charges were brought against staff members.\" In a joint statement the care trust's acting chief executive, Laura Roberts, and its chairwoman, Marilyn Taylor, said they were \"truly sorry\" for what took place and the way the trust managed the concerns of relatives. They admitted that the trust had a lot to learn from the events and promised that the findings from the internal inquiry would be \"integrated into our services for the benefit of current and future patients and relatives.\" Rowan ward, which Chi said had become isolated from other psychiatric services in the trust after reorganisation, was closed in December 2002."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
