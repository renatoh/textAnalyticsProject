It could be the year when everything changes: Scotland could vote to leave the UK, ending a union that has lasted three centuries; and Nigel Farage expects Ukip to win the European elections in May, hoping to set the general election agenda and propel Britain towards an exit from Europe. Could Roy Hodgson's England team bring back the World Cup? Probably not \u2013 many people are hopeful for 2014, but not that hopeful. Most of us are optimistic about 2014 for our families and the places we live, though more anxious about Britain as a whole. Economic optimism remains tentative, but it is triple the level it was at two years ago, albeit stronger in the south than the north. The biggest event for national identity will take place in Scotland. Just one in five Scots believes that Alex Salmond will win in September's independence referendum. There is little evidence of an English appetite for a split either. In May, Farage ought to be able to outpoll the bigger parties, not least as European elections usually see a narrower, older, more Eurosceptic electorate turnout. But most who plan to vote for Ukip say they intend it to be more a protest vote than a positive endorsement. That is reflected in a majority preference to mend rather than end Britain's EU membership: voters across the spectrum are sceptical, but would prefer the prime minister to renegotiate the deal than march for the exit. Even on immigration, public attitudes are less polarised than our public debates suggest. Most welcome those from Romania and Bulgaria who have come to work and contribute positively, even as they worry about whether the government has got a grip. Nor do people have time for playing political football with the first world war centenary, preferring a solemn commemoration to a public row about whether we were right to fight it. That event seems set to bring people together, and may surprise many in capturing how far back the shared history of a diverse Britain stretches. But it will often be more a year of multiple identities than \"one nation\". Even the sporting calendar looks different, with the Commonwealth Games most important in Scotland, the rugby Six Nations in Wales and the World Cup for the English. The year of identity seems unlikely to mark Britain's \"end of days\", but it will show both that national identity matters and how many competing visions of it are on offer. Even without a \"yes\" vote, Scotland looks likely to emerge from 2014 with a more confident identity. Wales, favourites to win the Six Nations, will want to influence the future of the UK too. Will it also be a year for Englishness? Events in Scotland may force the question. Yet with Uruguay and Italy providing formidable World Cup opponents, we can't rely on football to do the job for us. England finding a voice beyond sport is overdue. David Cameron and Ed Miliband should not put that conversation on hold until after Scotland has voted. Twenty-fourteen is a year which challenges us to decide who we are. These are our choices to make: if we want it to, identity can unite rather than divide us. Perhaps that's why the state of the nation seems less about revolutionary upheaval \u2013 perhaps more a British resolve to \"keep calm and carry on\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
