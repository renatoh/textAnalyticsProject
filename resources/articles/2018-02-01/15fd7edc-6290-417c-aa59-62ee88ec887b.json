Chelsea join Leicester in the quarter-finals after an easy victory over Hull. All four goals came in the first half, with the superb Willian scoring two beauties from outside the box. Thanks for your company. Do join us tomorrow for more warm FA Cup action. Goodnight! Chelsea 4-0 Hull City Willian, on a hat-trick, hits the outside of the post with a cracking curler from 25 yards. He has played beautifully. \u201cWilson was running at pace when Fabregas tripped him and knocked him off balance, he was carried entirely by momentum,\u201d says Phil Podolsky. \u201cBoom, case closed. *Adjusts monocle* even in the age of Trump, some of us still use science, reason and logick to argue online.\u201d I don\u2019t know what to believe any more. The only thing I trust is nihilism. Chelsea 4-0 Hull City Hull have had a lot of the ball in the second half. Chelsea declared at half-time, but it\u2019s still been a worthy effort from Hull. There are four minutes remaining. \u201cRegardless of factors like \u2018ability\u2019 and \u2018technique\u2019, Ethan Ampadu has the best hair on the pitch, and he plays for Wales,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI love him.\u201d Love is a many splendoured thing. Peep peep! Leicester are into the FA Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 2012. Jamie Vardy got the only goal with a smart header from the impressive Riyad Mahrez\u2019s cross. Chelsea 4-0 Hull City Drinkwater\u2019s deflected shot is superbly saved by Marshall, who was going one way and had to change direction at the last minute. Chelsea 4-0 Hull City Gary Cahill, who is usually an excellent finisher, misses an excellent volleyed chance from Willian\u2019s corner. Hull have played well in the second half. They could easily have thrown it in and lost 8-0. Chelsea 4-0 Hull City Caballero springs off his line to make an excellent save from Dicko, who skipped confidently past the last man Ampadu. At the other end, Willian delays too long when given a chance for his hat-trick, and then Zappacosta\u2019s fierce low shot is beautifully tipped round by Marshall. Chelsea 4-0 Hull City Scott gives the ball way to Irvine, whose shot is deflected onto the roof of the net by Ampadu. \u201cAt St James Park, we were very excited by Ethan Ampadu, a once in a generation talent who has an astonishing intuitive feel for what happens on a football pitch - that serenity you talk about stems from his uncanny ability to read the game,\u201d says Robin Durie. \u201cAll the more shame on Chelsea, therefore, who are lowballing Exeter City in their attempts to massage his value down for the transfer tribunal. This, from a club the routinely throws absurd amounts of money at overseas \u2018stars\u2019 who are frequently lucky if they make more than a handful of appearances. It\u2019s a pernicious aspect of the game in this country that teams like Exeter who develop talents like Ampadu can be, in effect, fleeced by the conglomerates of the Prem.\u201d Is that true? If so it\u2019s miserable, deplorable and just pathetic. Chelsea 4-0 Hull The second half has been more like a friendly than a competitive match. Chelsea are going to introduce another of their kids, with the debutant Kyle Scott replacing Cesc Fabregas. Leicester 1-0 Sheffield United Jamie Vardy has a goal disallowed for offside. It was given against Mahrez, whose lobbed header across goal was tapped in by Vardy. I think it was just the right decision, though it looked extremely tight. Leicester 1-0 Sheffield United Kasper Schmeichel keeps Leicester in front with an outstanding save low to his left from George Baldock\u2019s shot. Baldock should have scored but Schmeichel did so well to get enough on the ball that it dribbled wide of the post rather than into the net. Harry Wilson is leaving the field with a shoulder injury, sustained when he was fouled for the penalty. \u201cClear penalty, yes\u201d, says Nate Elliott. \u201cBut to make sure the referee whistled, he\u2019s thrown himself to the ground with such force that he\u2019s injured his shoulder. That\u2019s entirely his own doing. Impressive.\u201d That\u2019s exceptionally harsh. Leicester lead through a super goal from Jamie Vardy. It was a clever, lobbed header from a narrow angle after Riyad Mahrez picked him out with a booming deep cross. Meyler looked really nervous before taking the penalty. And though he struck it well, it was at saveable height and the penalty expert Caballero dived to his right to beat it away. That was a clear foul by Fabregas on Harry Wilson. No need for VAR there. The second half is under way at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea lead 4-0. The 17-year-old Callum Hudson-Odoi has come on for Pedro. Leicester City 0-0 Sheffield United So far this has been a fine defensive performance from United, who have restricted Leicester to only two or three good chances. The second half is a few minutes old at the King Power Stadium, where it\u2019s still Leicester City 0-0 Sheffield United. That was a swaggering, stylish performance from Chelsea, who have a great chance of reaching the FA Cup quarter-finals. Olivier Giroud gets his first Chelsea goal! It was a sharp near-post finish from the debutant Emerson\u2019s cross. He\u2019s looked good all night, Giroud, and has been involved in all four goals in one way or another. With Chelsea 3-0 ahead, the match at Stamford Bridge is petering out. There are six minutes remaining in the first half. If you\u2019re feeling generous, why not donate to this extremely worthy cause? (It\u2019s not a link to my bank details.) A quiet half at the King Power Stadium comes to an end. This could get embarrassing. Willian gets his second with a precise low shot from 25 yards that beats Marshall and sneaks in off the post. That\u2019s another nice goal. If you\u2019re not excited about Ethan Ampadu, you should be. For a 17-year-old centre-back he has an almost eerie serenity. Chelsea\u2019s attacking players look like they are having heaps of fun, and they are playing some lovely football. There\u2019s a moral in there somewhere. This is another fine goal. Fabregas clips an excellent first-time pass over the defence to Pedro, who controls it neatly in mid-air and then sidefoots it past Marshall. Chelsea sweep upfield on the counter-attack after a lovely ball out of defence by Ampadu to Willian. He eventually finds Pedro, whose low shot is well saved. \u201cSince the MBM seems to have fallen to musings, can I observe that the photo at the head of the column shows a very attractive Sheffield United kit?\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cThe clincher is the thin black border to the traditional red stripe. Very pleasing. Also the young man wearing it has a passing resemblance to Jonathan Woodgate. Anything happening on the pitch?\u201d No. Big bucks please! It\u2019s still 0-0 at the King Power Stadium, with nine minutes to go until half-time. Blackman has just made a fine save from Vardy, who was put through one on one by Mahrez. At the other end, Harry Maguire probably saved a goal with a brilliant last-ditch block. \u201cWell, now that the game at Chelsea is over what should we talk about?\u201d asks JR. \u201cHow about we talk about the West Brom players allegedly ganking that taxi in Barcelona? Gareth Barry would have been the last player I would have guessed to be involved in that stupidity. So he\u2019s the all-time Premier League leader in yellow cards and stealing taxis then.\u201d I do hope they will turn this story into a funny celebration if they score another goal this season. Drinkwater\u2019s cross skims across the face of goal and just wide. Chelsea could easily be 4-0 up and we\u2019ve only had 19 minutes. Chelsea look like scoring every time they attack. Fabregas\u2019s teasing through pass is diverted just wide of his own goal by Dawson, who had to do something or Pedro would have scored. Another chance for Chelsea. Pedro\u2019s lovely flipped pass over the defence is volleyed over the top by Giroud. That was a good chance for his first Chelsea goal. \u201cRob,\u201d says Alex Brown. \u201cI think you\u2019re worth big bucks!! Send me your bank sort code and account number and I will immediately transfer vast funds over. Oh; and let me have your date of birth; just as a reference.\u201d In case of use, my first pet was called Doone. \u201cEvening, Bob,\u201d writes Mac Millings. \u201cNostalgia was better in the early 80s, and so was Watford Football Club. The rise of Graham Taylor\u2019s underappreciated Hornets are the subject of this week\u2019s episode of the magnificent Nessun Dorma podcast, in which World\u2019s Leading Watford Expert, Lionel Birnie, tells a good story about a greyhound, and I reveal my disturbing obsession with John Barnes.\u201d I never thought you\u2019d succumb to the trappings of fame, Millings. A half chance for Hull, with Irvine heading over from Stewart\u2019s flat cross. An outrageous elastico pass from Willian finds Fabregas, whose low shot is pushed round by Marshall. It\u2019s all Chelsea. That early goal should make this a comfortable night for Chelsea. And that kind of insight is why they pay me the small bucks. Claude Puel picked a strong Leicester side and they are starting to dominate at the King Power Stadium. Jamie Vardy has just shot fractionally wide. Chelsea take the lead after 106 seconds. It was a fine goal from Willian, who nutmegged Stewart on the edge of the box and curled the ball into the far corner with his left foot. That\u2019s a peach. Peep peep! Chelsea kick off at Stamford Bridge. We\u2019ll be concentrating mainly on the Chelsea game, as that\u2019s on TV, but if there\u2019s a goal at Leicester you\u2019ll hear about it fourth. Not much has happened in the first 10 minutes. Peep peep! The Leicester/Sheffield United match is under way. Let\u2019s have some! Chelsea (3-4-3) Caballero; Rudiger, Cahill, Ampadu; Zappacosta, Drinkwater, Fabregas, Emerson; Willian, Giroud, Pedro. Substitutes: Eduardo, Chalobah, Sterling, Scott, Moses, Hudson-Odoi, Morata. Hull City (4-3-3) Marshall; Meyler, MacDonald, Dawson, Clark; Evandro, Stewart, Irvine; Wilson, Dicko, Diomande. Substitutes: McGregor, Grosicki, Toral, Batty, Keane, Campbell, Clackstone. Leicester (4-2-2-2) Schmeichel; Simpson, Morgan, Maguire, Chilwell; Ndidi, Iborra; Mahrez, Gray; Iheanacho, Vardy. Substitutes: Hamer, Dragovic, Fuchs, James, Silva, Albrighton, Diabate. Sheffield United (3-5-2) Blackman; Wright, Basham, O\u2019Connell; Baldock, Stevens, Lafferty, Lundstram, Carruthers; Wilson, Donaldson. Substitutes: Eastwood, Sharp, Stearman, Duffy, Heneghan, Evans, Brooks. Let us speak frankly: this is not the most inspiring fifth round draw in the history of the FA Cup*. The weekend starts with two fixtures that should be comfortable home wins, but have just enough potential for a shock to assuage my frustration at missing the Judge Judy marathon on Lifetime. Crisis-club Chelsea, three points off second place in the Premier League and still in the two biggest cup competitions, host Hull City. And Leicester, who aren\u2019t a bad outside bet to reach their first FA Cup final since 1969, are at home to Sheffield United. The matches would look a lot closer if they were being played on David\u2019s patch rather than Goliath\u2019s. Since you asked, Leicester\u2019s game is being played tonight to avoid a clash with the Leicester Tigers rugby match tomorrow. Chelsea\u2019s game has been moved for the purposes of 4K HD first-screen televisual entertainment. We\u2019ll have team news shortly. Leicester v Sheffield United begins at 7.45pm. Chelsea v Hull kicks off15 minutes thereafter. * Since you asked, 1990-91 looked pretty good before the event, and even better after it. The 1987-88 fifth round draw had a sniff about it, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
