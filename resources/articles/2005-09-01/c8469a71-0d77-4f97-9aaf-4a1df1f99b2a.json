After days of misty weather, the autumn song comes whistling down the years of memory into a warm, bright day. The remembered tune plays across the soft golding of great beech trees and dappled shade in woods. Its words are written in the litter of fallen leaves, crab apple windfalls and fungal fists. A scent which, like memory, reaches into the past from damp earth, stirs a kind of mythology and becomes a creative way of seeing the world through an emotion reserved for autumn. Looking up into a green stained-glass of hazel leaves, they are patterned with small dark shapes. These are hawthorn leaves fallen from the canopy; their arrangement written like a score through the wood and sung by robins as their own autumn song. It's a human impulse to create meaning out of random patterns and I felt this acutely as I flew into Stansted a few days ago. Spread across southern England was a vast patchwork of ochre and brown as harvested fields were being ploughed. The hedgerows and woods stitch these fields together into what appears to be a warm, familiar countryside. But this patterning belies the reality - a desertification of the countryside, where cultivation is destroying the delicate webs of soil organisms and wildlife habitats, particularly for birds which require stubble fields as autumn feeding grounds. Autumn is for gathering and decay; perhaps it's only in the forgotten or protected places now where we can still hear its song."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
