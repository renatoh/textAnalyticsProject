Thanks all for following and I will be back tomorrow for an exciting women\u2019s final between Iga Swiatek and Sofia Kenin. Here is Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report as Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic prepare to battle for a 56th(!) time. Q. You are a very passionate player. Everyone saw that out on the court today. Why does winning or losing mean so much to you? STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: It\u2019s a very good question actually. I was thinking about it the other day. Well, let\u2019s take it this way. If I wouldn\u2019t win, if I wouldn\u2019t be winning, I wouldn\u2019t be part of what I am now. I wouldn\u2019t be part of the Mouratoglou Tennis Academy. I wouldn\u2019t be, let\u2019s call it, a celebrity in my country. No one would knew me. It\u2019s all because of winning, of succeeding, managing to find ways to win matches. I wouldn\u2019t make money from tennis. I don\u2019t know what I would be doing, but tennis wouldn\u2019t be part of my life. Winning has provided a lot. Of course, good ways and bad ways. There are some deficits. Yeah, without winning I wouldn\u2019t have my sponsors. Without winning I wouldn\u2019t be traveling all around the world. Losing kind of keeps you in the same place, in the same spot, which is why I hate losing. Of course, I think everyone hates losing. It\u2019s weird if you don\u2019t hate losing. But I guess a loss is a very good lesson where life puts a stop at what you\u2019re doing. You can reflect on that. You can grow. You can get better. You can take that loss and turn it around, use it as a life lesson to move forward, to become a stronger person. The stories in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Roland Garros finals could not be any different: 19 year-old Iga Swiatek vs 21 year-old Sofia Kenin 33 year-old Novak Djokovic vs 34 year-old Rafael Nddal This final is quite important. This should be a significant moment in Tsitsipas\u2019s career. Once he was a little tired and less inhibited, he played exactly as he needs to against Djokovic, attacking off both wings, moving into the net and being so couragrous in the big moments. As the match wore on, he eventually learnt that his low slice was very effective against Djokovic, a shot that he needs to improve and incorporate into his game more naturally. More importantly, after recovering from two sets down in the first round and then pushing Djokovic today, this should affirm that he is on the right path mentally. What a strange, fascinating match. It is hard to think of a big match with such a big momentum swing in the big points. Until his match point at 6-3 6-2 *5-4 AD-40, Djokovic saved 10/10 break points and won 4/5 break points. After the match point until the beginning of set 5, he won 1/10 break points and saved 1/5. Almost 100 minutes after holding his first match point, Novak Djokovic finally sees off a courageous performance from Stefanos Tsitsipas to reach the French Open final against Rafael Nadal. After failing to close out the third set, he responded like a champion to see it out in five sets. Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-7 4-6 5-1* Stefanos Tsitsipas Djokovic flits through another hold, this time to 15. He closed it off with an enormous crosscourt forehand winner before nailing an unreturned serve at 40-15. He is once again one game away from rafael Nadal. Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-7 4-6 *4-1 Stefanos Tsitsipas It is difficult to see a way back here for Tsitsipas. Djokovic continues to return at a stratospheric level and it finally appears that Tsitsipas does not have much left resistance to give. After a sweeping point-ending forehand return from Djokovic at 15-30, Tsitsipas double faulted on break point to give Djokovic a double break. Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-7 4-6 3-1* Stefanos Tsitsipas Djokovic calmly consolidates his break to 30. Kudos to Tsitsipas, who immediately put pressure on Djokovic\u2019s serve after the break with a great forehand down the line at 30-15. At 30-30, Tsitsipas\u2019s dropshot attempt struck the tape and rolled back on his side. Djokovic closed off the game with a series of aggressive forehands. Tsitsipas\u2019s leg may still be hurting, but his attitude has been wonderful since the third set and he is still fighting even though Djokovic has taken control of this fifth set. Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-7 4-6 *2-1 Stefanos Tsitsipas Finally, Djokovic brings his best form on a break point to move up a break in the fifth set. Under pressure on his serve, Tsitsipas shanked a backhand long to bring up two more break points at 15-40. Despite his backhand error on the previous point, he boldly saved the first break point by crushing a pair of backhand down-the-line drives before sneaking into the net and finishing with a lovely volley. On the second break point, Djokovic took things into his own hands by delicately placing another drop shot winner. Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-7 4-6 1-1* Stefanos Tsitsipas Djokovic also opens the fifth set as he spent much of the fourth set, easing through a quick hold to 15 with ample big serves. Fifth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 4-6 5-7 *0-1 Stefanos Tsitispas Tsitsipas opens the final set precisely how he ended the fourth set, saving another break point before holding serve. Once again, Tsitsipas was rewarded for his courage on break point with an enormous point-ending inside out forehand. Tsitsipas moved to game point, where he was second best in a crazy point that included a dropshot from both players. However, the Greek kept on attacking and he has opened the set with a hold. Novak Djokovic is 215-1 after winning the first two sets of any best of 5 match and he has never lost a slam match from match point up. Stefanos Tsitsipas recovered from two sets down for the first time in his career in the first round. And yet we are off to a 5th set. Astonishing scenes on Court Philippe Chatrier as Djokovic crumbles in his service game from 40-15 to drop his serve and the set, closing off the run of four points with a drop shot into the net. Incredibly, they completely changed roles in this set. Djokovic was 1/11 on break points in set 4. Tsitsipas finished 2/2. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-7 *4-5 Stefanos Tsitsipas Tense, tense moments on Tsitsipas\u2019s serve, but once again he survives break point to keep himself ahead. Tsitsipas had reached 40-30, but Djokovic scuppered the game point with a bruising forehand down-the-line. At deuce, Djokovic surprised Tsitsipas with a drop shot, which he reached but then he could not control the following volley. Tsitsipas calmly slammed an ace down the T to save the break point and reached game point. Djokovic saved the game point with some astounding defence, eventually sweeping forward and playing a drop shot. Tsitsipas responded with a huge forehand crosscourt before connecting with an unreturned serve to hold. Djokovic will serve to stay in the fourth set. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-7 4-4* Stefanos Tsitsipas The clear issue for Tsitsipas right now is how easily Djokovic is breezing through his own service games. He coolly navigates a hold to 15, finding another big serve-forehand 1-2 punch on game point. The pressure returns to Tsitsipas. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-7 *3-4 Stefanos Tsitsipas A special hold from Tsitsipas, who saves four more break points to keep himself on serve. Once again, there was some incredible returning from Djokovic to bring up double break point at 15-40, but Tsitsipas found two serve-forehand 1-2 punch combos to save both break points. At deuce, Djokovic produced an incredible angled backhand passing shot at full stretch to produce a third break point. No matter, Tsitsipas once again moved forward, eventually dispatching an overhead. A fourth break point arrived, which Tsitsipas scuppered by landing a big serve and then crushing a point-ending forehand down the middle. From deuce, Tsitsipas nailed a backhand down the line winner to bring up game point. Djokovic finally missed a backhand on game point to relinquish the game. The quality is sky high right now from both and so far Tsitsipas is keeping up. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-7 3-3* Stefanos Tsitsipas Novak Djokovic breezes through a quick hold to 15, sealed with a drop shot and then a big serve down the T. That looked a lot more like his earlier simple holds and he seems calm again after seething over his missed opportunities early in the set. Stefanos Tsitsipas now has the trainer on, who is checking his foot. Tsitsipas was wincing throughout the previous game. No timeout, but it seems that he has taken some painkillers. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-7 *2-3 Stefanos Tsitsipas Tsitsipas\u2019s momentum may be well and truly gone, but he just saved three break points to keep himself on serve in the fourth set. He saved the first break point with a series of astounding forehands as Djokovic threw himself around the court. Immediately faced with a second break point, Tsitsipas drilled a backhand down-the-line winner. At deuce, Djokovic pulled off a brilliant drop shot to generate a third break point, which Tsitsipas saved with a hefty point-ending crosscourt forehand. With some excellent first serves, Tsitsipas finally pulled off a top class hold. Djokovic mostly served incredibly well in that set and one suspects that Tsitsipas is going to have to deal with more high class returning as the set foes on. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-7 2-2* Stefanos Tsitsipas Tsitsipas\u2019s momentum has truly been arrested now. Djokovic breezes through four points in a row from 0-15 down to hold. He finished with two unreturned serves, giving Tsitsipas plenty to think about. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-7 *1-2 Stefanos Tsitsipas Djokovic immediately breaks back after a very wasteful service game from Stefanos Tsitsipas. The number one initially upped his intensity, but then Tsitsipas bailed out of a long point with a poor attempt at a forehand drop shot at 0-30. On Djokovic\u2019s second break point at 15-40, Tsitsipas sent a routine forehand long. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-7 0-2* Stefanos Tsitsipas Tsitsipas opens the set with a love break. Oh how the momentum has turned. Suddenly, it is Djokovic who is missing break chances and the crumbling on his own serve. From 0-15, Djokovic threw in a rare double fault. At 0-30, Tsitsipas tracked down a Djokovic dropshot, slipping an angled forehand past him at the net. Djokovic closed off the game by badly mistiming a backhand down-the-line to hand over the break. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-7 *0-1 Stefanos Tsitsipas Tsitsipas saves break point to open the fourth set with an essential hold. After failing to convert two game points, Tsitsipas dropped a well intentioned drop shot into the net at deuce. He saved the break point with an excellent defensive forehand, which forced an error from Djokovic through its sheer depth. Tsitsipas then moved back onto the front foot, crushing a crosscourt forehand at deuce before holding with an unreturned serve. He has now won four games in a row. This is a different match for now. What an effort from Stefanos Tsitsipas, who recovers from match point down to force a fourth set. He finished the set crushing the ball now and finally starting to open his shoulders on his backhand. From 30-0 down, he drilled a backhand down the line winner and then a winning forehand down-the line on consecutive points to move to within two points of the set. At 30-30, Djokovic stumbled while moving to Tsitsipas\u2019s low slice, dumping a forehand into the net. Down set point, Djokovic found a first serve and demolished a series of forehands behind it, finishing with a forehand down-the-line winner. But Tsitsipas quickly generated a second set point, and this time he took his destiny into his own hands, crushing a forehand down-the-line winner to take the set. Djokovic leads 6-3 6-2 5-7. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 *5-6 Stefanos Tsitsipas After Schwartzman\u2019s second wind against Nadal, Tsitsipas has also shown plenty of courage towards the end of the third set. He recovered from 0-30 down to hold serve and guarantee a tiebreak at the worst. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 5-5* Stefanos Tsitsipas Tsitsipas saves match point to secure his first break of the match! Djokovic saved the first break point at 30-40 with a big first serve before moving to match point. But Tsitsipas was bold on the match point, eventually dragging Djokovic off the court with a great crosscourt backhand. Djokovic attempted to fire a backhand down-the-line from the tramlines and it flew wide. At deuce, Tsitsipas swept to the net and played a great first volley before putting away his overhead. Djokovic saved the second break point with an unreturned 190kmh second serve. But Tsitsipas continued to apply pressure and Djokovic finally overhit a forehand on the third break point. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 *5-4 Stefanos Tsitsipas Novak Djokovic breaks and will serve for the match after an incredible game of the highest quality from both players. They went back and forth with brilliant winning points, shot by shot, until Tsitsipas finally netted a forehand at deuce. On break point, Djokovic came up with an incredible return then a perfect drop shot to finally break. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 4-4* Stefanos Tsitsipas Djokovic has now won 12 points in a row on his serve as he breezes through another love service game with more excellent serving. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 *3-4 Stefanos Tsitsipas Tsitsipas recovers from 15-30 down to keep himself ahead. He is starting to come to the net more and it came good when he needed it. At 30-30, he swept forward behind a big forehand down-the-line and challenged Djokovic to make a good backhand passing shot. He couldn\u2019t and so Tsitsipas picked off an easy volley winner. At 40-30, Tsitsipas defended a couple of big blows from Djokovic before Djokovic finally sent a forehand into the net. A good hold. This set ha smoved very quickly. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 3-3* Stefanos Tsitsipas Novak Djokovic matches Tsitsipas with a quick, uneventful love hold of his own. Amidst some great serving throughout, Djokovic produced an incredible point at 15-0, nailing a backhand down-the-line before sweeping to finish with a forehand. An easy hold. Q. What do you think was the biggest difference between the match against Diego in Rome and the match today? RAFAEL NADAL: Well, I don\u2019t know. Well, yes, I know. Sorry (laughter). I think different scenario, first of all. Second thing, I think I am little bit more prepared here, no? Rome have been my first event after six months, and was the first challenge against Diego. Today I think the experience of Rome help me in some way because I was able to take a look on the match, to analyze the things that worked well and things that, of course, didn\u2019t work. Have been most of them, no? We tried to go on court with a plan, with the right determination. In some way I think I played tactically the right match. I think at the half of the first set I make a couple mistakes tactically and of course technically. But in general terms, I am super happy about the match. Have been an important victory for me against a very tough player. To win against Diego, you have to work a lot and you have to play well for such a long time. That\u2019s what I did today, no? I think I played solid. I played with the right determination in most of the moments of the match. Especially in the tiebreak I finished the match playing well. I needed to be a little bit more aggressive - a little bit - at the half of the third set when I had the score in my favor. I lost couple of opportunities there to close the match before and to not suffer like I suffered at the end. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 *2-3 Stefanos Tsitsipas Tsitsipas breezes his second love hold of the set, closed off with a big unreturned serve out wide. He is serving well, but can he take a break point? Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 2-2* Stefanos Tsitsipas A bit of a cheap return game from Tsitsipas there. From 30-15 to Djokovic, the Greek shanked a backhand and forehand in quick succession. An easy hold for Djokovic. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 *1-2 Stefanos Tsitsipas Tsitsipas moves through a good hold to 30, sealed with a huge wrong-footing forehand down the line winner. It should be noted that Djokovic has now saved break points on each of the opening game of the three sets today. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 1-1* Stefanos Tsitsipas Djokovic saves his 8th(!) break point to open the third set. There was some great work by Tsitsipas, who defended extremely well from 40-30, eventually annoying Djokovic until he dropped a drive volley into the net. At deuce, he once again soaked up some big blows from Djokovic, eventually crushing a crosscourt forehand on the run and forcing an error from the number one seed. But Djokovic\u2019s level has just been incredible on break points. This time he took control in a long point, saving the break point with a searing forehand crosscourt. He then connected with a quick serve and forehand one two punch at deuce. On AD-40, Tsitsipas missed a backhand second serve return. Another chance gone. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 6-2 *0-1 Stefanos Tsitsipas Stefanos moves to 40-0 in his third consecutive service game. Unlike the previous two that ended in two breaks, this time he immediately gets it done. It is a start. Second set stats: Novak Djokovic - 79% first serves in, 73% first serve points won, 50% second serve points won, 46% return points won, 8 winners, 7 unforced errors Stefanos Tsitsipas - 68% first serves in, 58% first serve points won, 48% second serve points won, 32% return points won, 9 winners, 12 unforced errors A few moments ago, this was a tight, tense match. Now it looks easy. Djokovic held to love with three aces in the game. He stands one set away from Nadal. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 *5-2 Stefanos Tsitsipas This is moving very quickly now. Tsitsipas was leading 40-0 and once again looked well on his way to a hold, only to lose his game points and eventually his serve. Djokovic erased one game point with an excellent backhand return and the second with a great drop shot, but then Tsitsipas threw in a poor backhand error followed by a double fault. Tsitsipas saved the first break point well, but then he made two more errors to meekly hand over the double break. Break points won: Novak Djokovic - 2/2 Stefanos Tsitsipas - 0/7 Sometimes tennis is as simple as this. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 4-2* Stefanos Tsitsipas Djokovic breezes through a quick hold to consolidate the break, sealed with a big service winner down the T. Djokovic has now won 9 of the last 11 points since. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 *3-2 Stefanos Tsitsipas Tsitsipas seemed to be cruising up 40-0, then after a loose error on the first point, Djokovic\u2019s unrivalled defence burst into life. First he nailed an incredible crosscourt backhand passing shot, then on consecutive points he threw up two excellent defensive lobs. Tsitsipas let the first overhead bounce, his effort flying just wide. He took the second in the air, which dropped into the net. From 40-0 to 40-AD, Tsitsipas completed the miserable game by shanking a forehand off a shot that struck the net cord. This is becoming an uphill battle now. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 2-2* Stefanos Tsitsipas This time, Djokovic recovers from 15-30 down to secure a far easier hold of serve. Djokovic found an excellent running angled forehand when he needed it at 15-30, but Tsitsipas ended the game with a missed backhand second serve return and then a netted forehand. Not quite good enough there. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 *1-2 Stefanos Tsitsipas In the first set, Tsitsipas immediately dropped his serve after failing to take early break points. Much better work from the Greek this time. He rallied from 15-30 down with a nice sequence: serve-forehand 1-2 punch, an excellent crosscourt forehand winner after a medium length point and then an unreturned serve. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 1-1* Stefanos Tsitsipas After establishing a 15-30 lead, Tsitsipas chased down a big Djokovic forehand and his defensive forehand landed shot, bringing Djokovic into the net. There was a massive gap for a crosscourt passing shot, but Tsitsipas chose wrong and screamed to the skies after Djokovic finished off the point with an easy volley. Djokovic has started the second set just a couple more errors and he handed over two break points at 30-40 and 40-AD. Both times, Djokovic found a big first serve, sweeping up the forehand that followed. Despite plenty of friction from Tsitsipas, Djokovic held on. Incredibly, Djokovic is now 7/7 on break points today. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-3 *0-1 Stefanos Tsitsipas Great serving from Tsitsipas to open the second set with a love hold. Aside from one poor service game in the opening set, he is playing well himself. First set stats: Djokovic - 75% first serve points won, 53% second serve points won, 12 winners, 13 unforced errors Tsitsipas - 70% first serve points won, 50% second serve points won, 33% return points won, 7 winners 9 unforced errors A top class set of tennis from Novak Djokovic, who handled the tense moment on his serve incredibly well. Djokovic looked to be strolling to a hold with two lovely drop shots behind his serve, then he quickly moved to 40-0 behind a serve-forehand down the line 1-2 punch. Then, confusingly, he lost focus and hit three unforced errors in a row. A tense point followed at deuce, with Djokovic\u2019s forehand clipping the tape then landing very close to the line. After eventually making a backhand error, Tstsipas returned to the mark and complained to the umpire, claiming it was out. Too late. Djokovic found a big serve on his fourth set point to close it out. First set: Novak Djokovic *5-3 Stefanos Tsitsipas After Djokovic opened the game with a lovely drop shot winner, Tsitsipas rolled through another hold to 15. Djokovic will serve for the first set. Q. Fans always love to compare the big three. As someone who has faced all three of them, talk about briefly what the challenges of the three of them are, and really who do you think is the best tennis player out there? DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: I\u2019m not going to say who is the better. But I can say the most beautiful thing about these three guys is how different are these guys on court and outside the court. They are really different. If you see, I don\u2019t know, the food from Nole, the food from Rafa or Roger, then how they play on court. One like play on clay, the other one on grass... You know, they are different. Also one lefty, the other one aggressive, the other one is sliding like nobody. I think the most beautiful thing it\u2019s for sure how different these guys are. So that\u2019s amazing. From me, is the best part to play with these guys. I\u2019m enjoying a lot because at this time I can play against these three guys in different tournaments, so I\u2019m enjoying a lot to see these guys on tour and playing against them. First set: Novak Djokovic 5-2* Stefanos Tsitsipas Djokovic holds to move to within a game of the first set, but what started as a sloppy game ended as one of the best. Both players opened the game trading poor errors as they progressed from 15-30 to 40-30 and then to deuce. But at deuce, Tsitsipas showed everything that he is capable of. First he soaked up some big blows from Djokovic, recovering with an excellent defensive forehand down-the-line, then moving into the net and killing the ball with a beautiful drop volley. Djokovic responded in kind, handling so much offensive pressure from the Greek, then chasing down a really well executed drop shot before playing a perfect forehand stop volley of his own ion the 23rd stroke. But Tsitsipas blinked at deuce, sending a forehand long, and Djokovic closed off the game with a quick serve-forehand 1-2 punch. First set: Novak Djokovic *4-2 Stefanos Tsitsipas Tsitsipas makes it through another quick, tidy hold to 15, sealed with some great serving and then a serve-forehand 1-2 punch on game point. Novak Djokovic is already winning 10/11 points behind his first serve. First set: Novak Djokovic 4-1* Stefanos Tsitsipas This is so good from Djokovic, who has started at such a high intensity and he also is serving really well. At 30-15, he mixed things up on serve with a kicker to Tsitsipas\u2019s backhand before crunching a forehand winner behind it. Then he closed off the hold to 15 with an unreturned 109mph second serve. First set: Novak Djokovic *3-1 Stefanos Tsitsipas Much better work from Tsitsipas, who pieces together a decisive hold to 15 to put himself on the board. Great serving and he finished with a searing crosscourt forehand. First set: Novak Djokovic 3-0* Stefanos Tsitsipas Djokovic flits through a love service game with some great serving to consolidate his break. Tsitsipas is trying to take the first strike, but he is making too many errors now. That escalated very quickly. First set: Novak Djokovic *2-0 Stefanos Tsitsipas After being unable to take his chances in the opening game, Tsitsipas opened with a poor service game and numerous double faults to find himself down 15-40. Unlike Tsitsipas, Djokovic only needed one. On the first break point, he came up with a magical shot, chasing down an excellent Tsitsipas crosscourt forehand and redirecting it for a running forehand winner. First set: Novak Djokovic 1-0* Stefanos Tsitsipas Well, that was some opening game. Djokovic saved four break points to open with a hold. Even more importantly, the level is already so high and both players are sharp and aggressive. From 0-40 down, Djokovic saved the break points well. He found two big serves from the left side and he slotted a backhand down-the-line winner after an intense point. Tsitsipas maintained pressure, drilling a crosscourt forehand to generate a fourth break point. From the fourth break point, Djokovic fired two forehand winners in a row to bring himself to advantage. He eventually took the game with a lovely bit of skill, curling a backhand passing shot around Tsitsipas after bringing him forward with a drop shot. Novak Djokovic will serve first. Stefanos Tsitsipas was so impressive in his quarter-final against Andrey Rublev and he clearly has everything he needs to cause Djokovic many problems today. He is serving extremely well, his movement has been incredible and he continues to be so committed to moving forward to the net behind his aggression. Tsitsipas hasn\u2019t dropped a set since losing the first two sets of his tournament. He is easily in some of the best form of his career. Stefanos Tsitsipas and Novak Djokovic have finally arrived on-court. Rafael Nadal on how the match changed in the third set: A couple of points. I had a couple of mistakes, yeah he played some good points and then I had one volley here... I know with Diego it\u2019s very difficult until the end. He\u2019s one of the players who makes more breaks on the tour without a doubt. But I know how the match is. A few weeks ago, I lost in Rome so I expected a very tough match. Happy the way that I played. I think I have been improving and today has been a very positive match for me. That is a 98.4126984% record in best of 5 matches on clay, if anyone is counting. Rafael Nadal is now 99-2 at Roland Garros. Please let that sink in. That was some detour from Nadal in the third set after an otherwise solid performance, but he got it done in the tiebreak. He is into a record-extending 13th final and he is still yet to drop a set. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-3 6-6 Diego Schwartzman To his credit, after all the struggles in this set, Nadal opened the tiebreak by stealing two points with a couple of touches of brilliance. On the first, Schwartzman flitted into the net behind a couple of huge forehands, only for Nadsl to slip a backhand passing shot behind him. Then Nadal was stranded at the net and demonstrated his great hands by reacting to a ball flying straight at him before putting away the second volley for 2-0. That was enough to wrestle away the momentum and now he stands at 6-0. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-3 6-6 Diego Schwartzman An incredible hold from Diego Schwartzman, who is suddenly on fire. From 15-15, he produced three top class points in a row: a screaming forehand down-the-line winner, an outrageous angled backhand winner after a long point and then a point-ending inside out forehand. A tiebreak will decide this interesting and confusing third set. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-3 6-5* Diego Schwartzman Nadal holds, but this has become so much more complicated than expected. He opened the game with a couple more inexplicable errors to find himself down double break point. From 15-40 down and a possible fourth set looming, Nadal came alive again. He saved the first break point with a searing forehand down-the-line, then he connected with a quick serve-forehand 1-2. At deuce he produced a third consecutive forehand winner. On advantage Nadal, it was Schwartzman\u2019s time to step up with his forehand, burying two consecutive huge point-ending forehands to create a third break point. On the third break point, Nadal changed things up completely, scuppering it with a brave serve and volley. After a couple more deuces, Nadal finally found a good unreturned swerving wide serve on game point to seal the hold. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-3 *5-5 Diego Schwartzman From 15-30 down and two points from defeat, Schwartzman pieced together an enormous hold to keep the pressure on Nadal. After a good unreturned serve from the Argentine at 15-30, Nadal had his chances. At 30-30, he perfectly opened up the court and set up a backhand down the line, only to stumble into the backhand and hit the net. At game point, Schwartzman controlled the point and threw everything at Nadal, who tracked everything down before responding with really good dropshot. Under immense pressure, Schwartzman chased it down and produced a lovely counter drop shot that was just good enough to elicit a Nadal error. Great fight from the Argentine to somehow keep this alive. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-3 5-4* Diego Schwartzman Much better from Nadal, who holds serve to love after losing his serve twice in a row. Much better serving from Nadal, who held with a big serve and down-the-line forehand 1-2 punch, punctuated with a loud \u201cvamos\u201d. Back to basics. One game away. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-3 *4-4 Diego Schwartzman Schwartzman rolls through a quick hold to 15 to put some pressure on Nadal\u2019s shoulders. Once again some sloppy unforced errors from Nadal, who ended with a poor return. He has plenty to think about here. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-3 4-3* Diego Schwartzman Another scrappy service game for Nadal, who drops serve once again from game point. Nadal saved the break point at 30-40 with an unreturned body serve, but then he fired a backhand well long. On the second break point, he stepped into the court and nervelessly demolished a forehand down-the-line winner. It seemed that the game would swing Nadal\u2019s way as he reached game point, but Schwartzman saved it by absolutely drilling the ball down the centre of the court off both wings until he elicited a backhand error. Nadal then threw in two errors, including a routine forehand error. A good effort from Schwartzman but this has been a very strange period since Nadal seemed to have taken control of the match at *3-1. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-3 *4-2 Diego Schwartzman That comeback did not last very long. Nadal breaks to love after a series of elementary errors from Schwartzman. On break point, Schwartzman netted his second routine backhand of the game to meekly hand it back. Nadal ended his previous service game so badly, but as always he refused to allow it to linger. You can only respect his mentality. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-3 3-2* Diego Schwartzman Admirably, Schwartzman is still fighting hard and he has forced himself back into the third set. He burst into this return game with blazing aggression and eventually it paid off as he drilled a backhand down-the-line to reach 30-30. Then Nadal missed an easy forehand to give him break point. Nadal ramped up his intensity to save the break point, ending a long point with a huge inside-in forehand. However, he couldn\u2019t repeat that form. From deuce, Nadal sent two consecutive forehands wide. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-3 *3-1 Diego Schwartzman Schwartzman drops his serve to love as Nadal continues to roll with his momentum. In truth, he offered more resistance to the umpire Aurelie Tourte he argued with her about a mark at 0-30 than to Nadal. Here is my piece looking ahead to the women\u2019s final tomorrow between Iga Swiatek and Sofia Kenin. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-3 2-1* Diego Schwartzman Nadal rolls through another easy hold, this time to love. Nadal continues to serve extremely well and he is also opening up his shoulders off the ground, particularly crunching a big crosscourt forehand winner at 30-0. The pressure is building on Schwartzman\u2019s serve. Schwartzman\u2019s return games won: Previous rounds: 55% Today: 10% Brutal. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-3 *1-1 Diego Schwartzman Schwartzman opens his account in set three with a quick hold to 15, sealed with an ace down the T. There was an incredible point at 30-15, in which Nadal defended two huge blows from Schwartzman, produced a backhand lob over Schwartzman\u2019s head. After all of that work, Nadal shanked his forehand well out off Schwartman\u2019s limp response. Otherwise, a routine hold for the Argentine. Third set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-3 1-0* Diego Schwartzman Nadal rolls through a quick hold to 15 to open the third set. Some great serving from Nadal, including his third ace. Second set stats: Rafael Nadal - 80% first serves in, 81% first serve points won, 75% second serve points won, 8 winners 7 unforced errors, 41% return points won Diego Schwartzman - 66% first serves in, 58% first serve points won, 60% second serve points won, 20% return points won 9 winners 12 unforced errors A much better serving performance in set two from Nadal, who only lost 4 points on his serve in the entire set against one of the top three returners in the world. Schwartzman needs a miracle and it is difficult to believe that he will get one. Sadly for Schwartzman, the errors piled up in the final game. He double faulted at 30-15 and then sent a forehand wide at 30-30. Sensing blood, Nadal buried a forehand down-the-line and happily watched the Argentine\u2019s forehand response fly well long. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 5-3* Diego Schwartzman Nadal waltzes through a quick love hold to move to within a game of a two-set lead. Great serving from him, dismounting with his second ace of the day. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 *4-3 Diego Schwartzman Somehow, Schwartzman recovers from 0-40 down to hold serve. There was a very clear hangover from Nadal\u2019s escape in the previous game, with a couple of errors from Schwartzman immediately pushing him close to being a double break down. From triple break point, it was Nadal\u2019s turn to produce some underwhelming tennis. He will be particularly unhappy about missing a routine return at 30-40. At deuce, Schwartzman just did enough with a forehand down the line to elicit a forehand forced error from Nadal. Nadal then missed another simple return. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 4-2* Diego Schwartzman This seemed like a big chance for Schwartzman, who opened the game by slamming a backhand down-the-line winner, then at 0-15 he picked off Nadal at the net with a forehand passing shot at full stretch which elicited the loudest cheer of the day. At 0-30, Schwartzman just missed a backhand down-the-line wide. From that point, Nadal sensed the danger and response was incredible. At 15-30, he slipped into the net behind a great forehand down-the-line and finished off the point with a pair of very good overheads. At 30-30, Nadal unleashed on a huge inside out forehand winner. He finished the game at 40-30 with a drop shot winner of a sliding serve out wide. That was a very ominous game for Schwartzman and the others in the draw, a great indication of his confidence. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 *3-2 Diego Schwartzman Good work from Schwartzman to keep the gap to only one break, laying down a big crosscourt forehand on game point to hold for 15. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-1* Diego Schwartzman Nadal quickly consolidates the break. Things could have become more complicated at 30-30, but Schwartzman sent a quite routine forehand wide as he tried to take control of the point. On the first game point, Nadal took Schwartzman by surprise in another long exchange by injecting huge pace into a forehand down-the-line. This is a tough score to come back from. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 *2-1 Diego Schwartzman Nadal is looking very good now as he breaks early in set two. After some enormous hitting to open the return game, he sealed the break by grinding out a backhand error from Schwartzman, maintaining his depth all the way. Needless to say, this is a completely different Rafael Nadal to the player in Rome a few weeks ago. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 1-1* Diego Schwartzman Nadal follows Schwartzman\u2019s love hold with a love hold of his own. Great serving from Nadal, who closed it off with a service winner down the T. Both players have started this set trying to be more aggressive earlier in the point. Winners - Unforced errors: Diego Schwartzman - 6 winners 15 unforced errors Rafael Nadal - 16 winners 11 unforced errors Quite the difference, but it just goes to show how difficult to hit the ball past Nadal on this surface. Schwartzman was aggressive in that set and controlled many of the points, yet Nadal was usually there even if he didn\u2019t win the point. Second set: Rafael Nadal 6-3 *0-1 Diego Schwartzman Schwartzman opens the second set with a quick hold. After some huge hitting, he sealed off the love service game with a backhand crosscourt winner. Nadal holds to take the first set, but it sure wasn\u2019t easy. It seemed like he was en route to a simple hold at 40-30, but on his first set point Nadal netted a routine forehand. At deuce, Nadal produced one of his most impressive points of the day to produce a second set point. Schwartzman was dictating the rally, moving Nadal from side to side and then he cracked open the court with a really nice forehand angle. Nadal cut off the angle and then crushed a whistling backhand crosscourt winner straight off it, roaring in glee. On Nadal\u2019s second set point, it was Schwartzman\u2019s turn to counterpunch expertly, soaking up numerous Nadal forehand down-the-line drives before he forced a Nadal backhand error with a deep forehand. Nadal brilliantly responded at deuce with a surprise drop shot early in the point that Schwartzman simply could not react to. Finally, on the third break point, Schwartzman dumped a backhand into the net. First set: Rafael Nadal *5-3 Diego Schwartzman After a period of tough, long holds and multiple break points faced, suddenly we have three quick holds in a row. With an excellent forehand cross-court winner, Schwartzman closes out his service game to 15 for 3-5. He is still there, still putting pressure on Nadal to keep his level up. That is all you can do. First set: Rafael Nadal 5-2* Diego Schwartzman Half an hour later, Rafael Nadal finally produces his first hold without having to save a break point. Some great serving from Nadal, who swept to the net behind a serve volley at 30-15 and then he dismounted to 15 with a service winner. Quality hold. Meanwhile, Swiatek and partner Melichar just lost a first set tiebreak to Guarachi/Krawczyk. First set: Rafael Nadal *4-2 Diego Schwartzman Schwartzman gets his first hold of the match and he did very well. After losing so many big points on his serve so far, this time Schwartzman rose to the occasion at 30-30, breaking Nadal\u2019s backhand down with a vicious combination of crosscourt forehands. He then produced an excellent, surprising slice second serve down the T that produced a rare free point on an important point. Good work. First set: Rafael Nadal 4-1* Diego Schwartzman Nadal saves a break point to secure an essential hold, consolidating his break. Nadal led 40-15, only for Schwartzman to drag Nadal back to deuce by taking control of two long rallies and finishing down the line. As the deuces piled up, Nadal produced a big ace down the T to save Schwartzman\u2019s one break point. Eventually, Nadal found a serve and forehand combo on game point ot holf. Nadal has faced break point in each service game so far, but unlike Schwartzman he has survived two of them. First set: Rafael Nadal *3-1 Diego Schwartzman Nadal certainly had no problems hitting through the court to break for a second straight time. At 15-15, Nadal crushed point-ending crosscourt backhand winner. Then he unloaded on a forehand down-the-line after a long ad court rally. Finally, Nadal chased down a Schwartzman drop shot and was more than equal to the lob that was followed, finally finishing the point on an overhead. That was Nadal\u2019s best game of the match so far. First set: Rafael Nadal 2-1* Diego Schwartzman Schwartzman breaks back. This was turning into a poor start for Schwartzman as he hit his 8th unforced error to fall down 30-15 on Nadal\u2019s serve. But he recovered so well. He found a gorgeous angled backhand at 30-15 after a 25 stroke rally. Then after an intense exchange from the deuce side at 30-30, Schwartzman unloaded on a crosscourt forehand. He then soaked up a couple of big backhands from Nadal, before the Spaniard dumped a backhand into the net. At the moment, the Argentine is finding it much easier to hit through these slower conditions than Nadal. First set: Rafael Nadal *2-0 Diego Schwartzman Nadal immediately breaks serve after a messy opening service game from Schwartzman. The Argentine led 30-0, then lost four points in a row. At 30-30, he double faulted and then he dumped a routine backhand into the net on the first break point. First set: Rafael Nadal 1-0* Diego Schwartzman Just a relaxed 14 minute opening game filled with long, intense rallies to get the blood flowing. A great effort from Nadal, who saved two break points to hold serve. After recovering from 40-15 to deuce, Schwartzman chased down a couple of big forehands before seamlessly flipping from defence to offence, finishing with a great crosscourt backhand. On break point, Schwartzman missed a second serve return. Schwartzman later created a second break point to which Nadal responded with an excellent drop shot, eventually finishing the point with a nice volley. Nadal finally closed it off with a big crosscourt backhand. We may be here for a long time. Time spent on court: Diego Schwartzman - 13h34m Rafael Nadal - 10h04m Both players are just finishing their warm-up. Nadal will serve first. Rafael Nadal leads the head-to-head against Diego Schwartzman 9-1 and 4-1 on clay, but even before Schwartzman got his first win over Nadal last month, he has always been an irritant for Nadal. He tends to play well at least for a few sets, as was the case when he took a set off Nadal in their only match at Roland Garros in the 2018 quarter-final. There are many long rallies to come and Schwartzman will once again be looking to move forward to the baseline when he can, take the ball early off both wings and control the points. The quality backhand cross-court into Nadal\u2019s forehand from the ad court will determine a lot. Let\u2019s see. A succinct demonstration of Diego Schwartzman\u2019s incredible level against Nadal in Rome two weeks ago. This is the most recent update on Novak Djokovic\u2019s neck issues. Hello! Welcome to day 13 of our Roland Garros coverage as men\u2019s semi-final day is finally upon us and we have two very exciting matches on slate. First up, 12 time Roland Garros champion and 2nd seed Rafael Nadal will face 12th seed Diego Schwartzman. Top seed Novak Djokovic will follow with a very interesting match-up with 5th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas. For all the quality tennis being played by others, the main topic in the men\u2019s tournament has been about Nadal and Djokovic and whether a meeting in the final is inevitable. Both players reached the quarter-finals without dropping a set but quarter-finals finally produced some friction as 19 year-old Jannik Sinner served for the first set against Nadal before Djokovic entered his quarter-final against the formidable Pablo Carreno Busta with some discomfort in his neck and shoulder. For a set and a bit, he was on the ropes until he elevated his level and recovered to win in four sets. What is clear is that both semi-final opponents are capable of beating them. After constantly making life difficult for Nadal across their 9 previous meetings, Schwartzman finally achieved his first win against Nadal three weeks ago in Rome with the best performance of his career. He broke Nadal\u2019s serve 5 times in total and was a constant pest from the baseline, taking the ball so early and lasering winners off both sides to win 6-2 7-5. However, Rome was Nadal\u2019s first tournament back after lockdown and although the conditions in Paris are not ideal for him, he now has more matches under his belt, best of 5 sets and the comfort of playing at a tournament where he boasts a 98-2 record. This is all extremely difficult. Is Stefanos Tsitsipas ready to step up to Novak Djokovic\u2019s level? Although he already reached a slam semi-final at the 2019 Australian Open, this is Tsitsipas\u2019s most impressive two weeks of his career so far. After the horror of failing to convert 6 match points in his US Open fourth round against Borna Coric and arriving late in Paris after competing in the Hamburg final against Andrey Rublev, he lost the first two sets of the tournament against Jaume Munar. Since his first career recovery from two sets down, he has not lost a set and shocked a lot of people by dismantling Rublev in three sets on Wednesday. The resistance he produces against Djokovic today will reveal a lot about him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
