Poised and confident, she is one of 11 young women trained to run the Malgudi coffee shop at the Green Hotel, Mysore. The Hotel is the brainchild of Dame Hilary Blume, founder of the Charities Advisory Trust in London. But Gouri's mother could hardly have dreamed that her daughter would enter such a place. Waitressing is not in the realm of possibilities for India's dalits, politically incorrectly dubbed untouchables. Her parents might even have cursed the birth of a girl. For them, life is a daily struggle. Gouri scrubbed floors and bathrooms from a young age. Dalits are not allowed to aspire to anything higher than the most menial tasks. And the bottom of the caste ladder is the Balmiki community into which Gouri was born. For over a hundred years, Gouri's ancestors have cleaned filthy cess pools, the kind shown in Slumdog Millionaire. They muck out human excreta from private and public latrines. They think this is their destiny, their karma, because of the sins of a previous birth. What's more, everyone else thinks so too. So if Gouri's grandmother dared to aspire to any other profession, fifty years ago, she would have been beaten up, possibly stripped and paraded naked, or even killed, for daring to be too big for her boots. At the 2001 Durban World Conference against Racism, posters proclaimed to the world that in India, every day three Dalit women are raped, two Dalits are murdered and two Dalit houses are burned. Every hour two Dalits are assaulted. For 12 years now I've followed India's toilet cleaners in different parts of the country ranging from Bangalore in the south to Punjab in the north. Everywhere, there is fatalism. \"There's no option. No one will give us another job. There's very little else we can do.\" They are condemned to clean toilets, remove dead animals and at best become sweepers. Although the Indian constitution banned untouchability sixty years ago, even today dalits are forbidden, in interior villages and small towns, from doing anything other than low menial jobs. The breakthroughs are few and far between. Though some people have been educated and managed to slip out of the system, by and large, few dalits dare to dream of other vocations. Some women have thrown down their brooms, in a gesture of defiance, persuaded by a campaign launched by the cleaning workers movement the Safai Karmachari Andolan (SKA) to eradicate the illegal system of shovelling shit manually. They aimed to bring dignity and self esteem back to a battered community. \"I decided to throw down my broom and never to clean shit again,\" said Shanthi from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. \"The upper caste people complained to my family. My husband beat me up.\" \"So you think you are born in a palace?\" He screamed. \"Go and do your work you bitch, it's what you were born for.\" \"I took the verbal abuse and the beatings but I refused to go back. I found a factory job. They followed me to my factory, complained I'd become too big for my boots. I lost that job. They hounded me, but whenever I lost a job, I moved on and found another. For one year now I have changed six jobs. They finally gave up harassing me. I will work till I drop, but I will never clean shit again.\" Dalits from Gouri's community are prohibited from touching food meant for dominant castes. If a dalit touches the plate of an orthodox, upper caste person they might throw away the food and even the plate. The food or the touch of a balmiki like Gouri would be considered polluting. In some places, the offender might even be killed for polluting her superiors. To break this centuries old taboo, we decided to start a coffee shop run by Gouri and ten other young women from her community, living in the slums of Mysore. So in February 2009, we opened The Malgudi. It was a huge political statement. Major newspapers and local TV channels covered it. This was the first all women's caf\u00e9 in the city and probably the first dalit caf\u00e9 in India. The Malgudi shop has the best cakes, croissants, breads and quiche in Mysore. From bathrooms to French baking is a quite a career change. The girls are delighted. \"We never dreamed we could ever work in such a grand hotel\" one girl, Lakshmi told a journalist. The new fad in Indian coffee shops is staff dressed in the worst of the west, badly made uniforms with baseball caps! Our waitresses, dressed traditionally are making a deliberate statement. \"They are charming. They glide around so gracefully, like princesses, they light up the room in their yellow and burgundy costumes,\" a British guest enthused. We chose beautiful tiles from the Chettinadu district in Tamil Nadu. It's helped revive a tradition and requests and enquiries about the tiles have been pouring in, providing employment to an almost redundant craftspeople. Employing eleven girls is not a huge project. But for the balmiki community it's historic. It gives hope, encourages people to venture beyond a world of toilets and brooms and provides role models to the younger generation. It shows them that nothing is impossible. If the wealthiest, the smart set of Mysore can eat food served by dalit girls, that's a giant step for the community. It's a sign of hope. Change is definitely in the air."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
