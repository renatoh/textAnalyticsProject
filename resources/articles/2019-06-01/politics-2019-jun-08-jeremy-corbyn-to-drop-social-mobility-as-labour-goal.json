In a shift being billed by Labour strategists as the rejection of 40 years of political consensus, Corbyn said on Saturday that pursuing social mobility \u201chas failed, even on its own terms\u201d. Speaking at a Labour education event in Birmingham, the party leader vowed to replace the idea that the brightest, most talented young people must have the opportunity to succeed, with a demand that all children be allowed to flourish. \u201cFor decades we\u2019ve been told that inequality doesn\u2019t matter because the education system will allow talented and hard-working people to succeed whatever their background. But the greater inequality has become, the more entrenched it has become,\u201d he is expected to say. \u201cThe idea that only a few talented or lucky people deserve to escape the disadvantage they were born into, leaving in place a social hierarchy in which millions are consigned to the scrap heap, results in the talents of millions of children being squandered.\u201d Labour would replace the social mobility commission, which is chaired by Dame Martina Milburn, with a social justice commission, the party said. The watchdog would publish \u201csocial justice impact assessments\u201d of government policies \u2013 including green papers, white papers and legislation. It would also publish advice to ministers about how best to pursue social justice. Responding to questions about what a social justice commission would do that a social mobility commission has not, Corbyn said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to make sure that we get an education system that makes sure all of our children achieve their best in school. \u201cThe idea of social mobility where you pluck somebody out of poverty and promote them into a private school education or promote them somewhere else doesn\u2019t actually help the majority. What we have is a lot of under-used talent in society. \u201cA social justice commission will be there to make proposals, ask very tough questions of government and will measure our government against the improvements in social mobility for the entire population, not just the few.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s move is the latest evidence of his team\u2019s determination to reshape Labour \u2013 and underlines his belief that the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments did not do enough to shake up the economic system. Enhancing social mobility has been the aim of governments on both sides of the political divide. Blair\u2019s close ally Peter Mandelson memorably said he was \u201cintensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes\u201d \u2013 though he has since admitted he has become more concerned about inequality. Labour is keen to show that its thinking has developed since Corbyn and his advisers drew up the 2017 general election manifesto. Theresa May made it her goal shortly after becoming prime minister to create a \u201cgreat meritocracy\u201d in Britain, not least by expanding grammar schools \u2013 a policy that was quietly dropped after the Tories lost their majority in 2017. At the Birmingham event the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \u201cFocusing only on a lucky few leaves inequality entrenched and those from disadvantaged backgrounds with few opportunities to get on. That was the damning verdict of the government\u2019s own social mobility commission, which Tory ministers have shamefully ignored.\u201d She embraced the legacy of past Labour governments, saying: \u201cThe Tories like to talk about people like me who had a difficult start but got on in life as evidence that anyone can succeed on their own. But actually my life shows the exact opposite. Any success I have had is thanks to Labour governments that provided the council house, minimum wage, tax credits and Sure Start children\u2019s centre that enabled me to achieve it. That is social justice.\u201d The social mobility commission was set up by David Cameron\u2019s coalition government. Its most recent report found that inequality is \u201cnow entrenched from birth to work\u201d, with social mobility stagnating \u201cat virtually all life stages\u201d over the past five years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
