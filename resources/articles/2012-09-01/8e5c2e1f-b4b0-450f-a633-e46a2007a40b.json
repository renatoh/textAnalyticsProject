But if courtesy means picking up a call from someone who needs to talk, then it is something which the Department for Work and Pensions has decided it cannot afford. As it prods benefit claimants to make applications on the net, the DWP has decided to subject them to a prerecorded diatribe about the \"advantages of using the online service\". The schmaltzy voice and grating musical score are all too easy to imagine. It's always frustrating to be on hold while your ears are washed out with the lie that \"your call is important to us\", but it must feel like a real kick in the shins after losing your job. And, unlike with the run-of-the-mill understaffed corporate, even available operatives are to be barred from answering. Not picking up when you easily could is the modern-day means of passing by on the other side of the road. The devout Iain Duncan Smith ought to rethink."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
