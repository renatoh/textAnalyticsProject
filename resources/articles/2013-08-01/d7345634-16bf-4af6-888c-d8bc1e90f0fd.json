Scotland's deputy first minister, who runs the Scottish government's independence strategy, said a new analysis by her officials had established that women and mothers would lose out far more heavily than men from the UK government's tax, benefits and child support reforms. While women and lone mothers in particular suffered more than men across the UK, Scotland also had a larger population share amongst the key benefits affected, amplifying the damaging impact of the reforms within Scotland, the report said. After a UK cabinet minister accused her government of embarking on a full-scale retreat from independence, Sturgeon said that only a break from Westminster would allow the Scottish parliament to protect women and other vulnerable claimants. While her government had set up and funded a \u00a333m welfare fund to cover some of those cuts, helping 20,000 people so far, the current devolution settlement severely limited its scope for more radical action. \"However, mitigating the whole range of these cuts will simply not be possible. The only solution is for this parliament to have full powers of independence so that we can devise policies to benefit the Scottish people and ensure fair and decent support for all,\" Sturgeon said. Sturgeon and policymakers in the Yes Scotland pro-independence campaign believe attacking the UK government's welfare cuts offer them the best chance of increasing flatlining support for independence, particularly among the urban, centre-left and lower income voters most likely to vote yes next year. In a renewed pitch to the same centre-left voter, Alex Salmond fleshed out his proposals for Scotland to have its first written constitution post-independence, as a legal guarantee of people's rights and a guarantee of popular sovereignty. In a speech in Campbeltown on the Mull of Kintyre, the first minister said the UK was alone within the EU and the Commonwealth as the only state without a written constitution. Confirming that work on a constitution would only start after the 2016 Scottish elections, using \"citizens' conventions\", Salmond said: \"Modern countries use their constitutions to articulate their values, to define who they are. They don't only protect human rights; they enhance liberties and define responsibilities. Scotland's constitution will do the same.\" He added: \"Independence offers the opportunity for Scotland to move away from that outdated and profoundly undemocratic Westminster system \u2013 one which, for two thirds of my life, has delivered governments with no popular mandate in Scotland. \"We will move instead to a more transparent, democratic and effective system of government \u2013 a government of the people, by the people and for the people of Scotland.\" The new welfare report, the latest in a series of analyses prepared by Scottish government civil servants, said the new universal credit system, which gives priority to the primary earner in any household and makes a single payment to that household, would worsen the already greater impact on female claimants of Westminster's first swath of welfare reforms identified by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in 2011. Her critics insist that Sturgeon's arguments that a future Scottish government would produce fairer and more compassionate strategy has been weakened by her failure to publish any details on the shape and structure of a new Scottish welfare system post-independence. Sturgeon's own panel of welfare experts said earlier this year that the UK's welfare system was so heavily integrated, an independent Scotland would need to keep the UK system intact for the rest of the decade. Sturgeon also acknowledges her government's crucial white paper on independence due to be published within weeks would not give any details of a new welfare system. Voters would need to wait for the 2016 Holyrood elections to see such proposals, she said. Michael Moore, the Scottish secretary, said these disclosures significantly weakened Sturgeon's attacks given how central they were becoming to her referendum strategy. Voters, he said, needed to see clear and specific details of what an independent Scotland would look like in the white paper. Following a speech claiming the Scottish government would \"say and do anything\" to win next year's referendum, Moore said: \"Details of the welfare system out to be a sign of the credibility of what's coming.\" The same counted for Scotland's membership of the EU, its proposed currency union with the UK and on defence. \"The white paper has got to be straight with the people of Scotland, about the risks and the uncertainties and what remains to be negotiated,\" he said. \"The white paper has to be substantive but it also has to be realistic.\" Anti-independence campaigners also seized on a heavily critical analysis of Alex Salmond's plans for a sterling currency union with the rest of the UK from Brian Quinn, who served as deputy governor of the Bank of England in 1996. In a paper for the Edinburgh-based David Hume Institute thinktank, Quinn said that while sharing sterling and financial regulation with the UK was the best option for Scotland, it was a solution riddled with significant difficulties. Scottish banks would pay a far heavier price for using the Bank of England as lender of last resort, particularly the costs of guaranteeing deposits, and that could force them to relocate their headquarters to London. And sharing financial regulators and institutions between two rival countries meant there was an \"in-built\" risk of repeated disputes. Quinn also disputed Salmond's claims that the UK would again help bail out Scottish banks in a future financial crisis. The \"assumption that other UK taxpayers should share the costs of the collapse of Scottish banks does not appear to have a legitimate basis:\", Quinn said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
