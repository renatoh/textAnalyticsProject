Taoiseach Leo Varadkar sent a handwritten message saying he was a \u201chuge fan\u201d of the Australian pop star, offering to meet her in person ahead of her Dublin concert in October last year. \u201cDear Kylie,\u201d he wrote. \u201cJust wanted to drop you a short note in advance of the concert in Dublin. I am really looking forward to it. Am a huge fan! \u201cI understand you are staying in the Merrion hotel which is just across the street from my office in Government Buildings. If you like, I\u2019d love to welcome you to Ireland personally.\u201d The department of the Taoiseach twice blocked the freedom of information request from The Irish Mail on Sunday, before Varadkar consented to the information being made public. The department initially blocked the request because the letter was written \u201cin a personal capacity\u201d and did not \u201crelate to matters arising in the course of the purpose of the Taoiseach\u2019s functions as the head of government\u201d. Sadly, the Australian pop star had to cancel the October concert mentioned in Varadkar\u2019s letter, due to a throat infection. But Minogue personally called him to apologise, and finally met with the leader at a rescheduled concert in December. Varadkar then had to deny accusations he had received a free meal at the concert. Varadkar also made international headlines last month when he brought his partner to meet with US vice president Mike Pence, and spoke against homophobia and LGBT discrimination."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
