Furnished with an eclectic mix of antiques, salvaged furniture from architectural sites and modern classics, the hostel boasts a restaurant in the scullery and a bar (serving cocktails) in the chapel. There are single sex and mixed dorms along with some private rooms for couples. Best of all, if two of you book one of the bespoke Jacobean double beds in a mixed dorm, one of you stays for free. And the beds have curtains around them. too. \u2022 40 College Crescent NW3, +44 (0)20-7483 8470, palmerslodge.co.uk, from \u00a316pp Clink78 If ever a hostel had too much history, it's Clink 78. Not content with being a 200-year-old former courthouse, it just happens to be the place where The Clash stood trial (that particular courtroom is now a TV lounge). In another courtroom (now given over to internet access), Charles Dickens had the idea for Oliver Twist. You can stay in a dorm fitted out with hi-tech pod beds, in a private room or, for the full effect, in one of the seven police cells. With a brand new kitchen, bar, travelshop and a free daily London walking tour, it's a guilty pleasure all right. \u2022 78 King's Cross Road WC1, +44 (0)20-7183 9400, clinkhostels.com, from \u00a316pp YHA Oxford Street After years of trying, the YHA has finally shrugged off its image of huge dorms populated by earnest young people drying out their anoraks over a lukewarm radiator. Indeed, their flash inner-city hostels are pretty much budget hotels nowadays. This Oxford Street number (actually just around the corner on Noel Street) is fresh from a \u00a31.5m refit giving it a sleek contemporary look. For a hostel in the heart of the capital boasting all mod cons (including a caf\u00e9/bar and laundrette), it's fantastically good value. Guests can choose one of the two-, three- or four-bed rooms or, if they feeling a little nostalgic, a small dorm. \u2022 14 Noel Street W1, 0845 371 9133, yha.org.uk, under-18s \u00a312.50 (\u00a33 extra for non-members), adults \u00a316.65 YHA Holland Park Offering a completely different vibe to the YHA's brash modern Oxford Street affair (see above), a wing of the building was built in 1607 as a Jacobean mansion. Overlooking Holland Park itself and a within easy walking distance of Kensington's clutch of museums, the 200-bed hostel comprises large comfy dorms with a smattering of smaller rooms. The restaurant (nothing so plebeian as a caf\u00e9!) opens on to a private garden with its own ornamental pond. Sir Walter Scott, Byron, Wordsworth, Sheridan and Charles Dickens all visited the house in their time and would no doubt be thrilled to find that guests can still use a library here. \u2022 Holland House, Holland Walk W8, 0845 371 9133, yha.org.uk, under-18s \u00a312.50 (\u00a33 extra for non-members), adults \u00a316.65 Blue Skies Hostel Just outside Tulse Hill station, The Railway Tavern claims to possess the largest pub garden in London. With the opening of its swish new Blue Skies Hostel upstairs, it's also one of the capital's few pubs to offer dorm accommodation (mixed dorms, a female only dorm and double rooms). It's close to Brockwell Park's caf\u00e9s and lido and, while Tulse Hill isn't brimming over with attractions, the pub does hold frequent live music nights. For those on a budget, on Mondays and Tuesdays the pizzas are half price and breakfast is thrown in free every morning. Guests may choose if it's accompanied by a hangover. \u2022 7 Station Rise SE27, +44 (0)20-8674 4101, therailwaytulsehill.co.uk (but book through hostelworld.com), from \u00a313pp (longterm rates available) St Christopher's Inn Warning: this is not a place for shy retiring types who fancy a quiet night in with a cocoa and a crossword. The hostel makes the proud claim that, with its Belushi's Bar, it's \"the international party house\". Ozzie beer, homemade burgers, televised sports and retro rock 'n' roll sounds provide the buzz, and even the hostel's chill-out room has a 24-hour bar. Close to the Central Line and Shepherd's Bush Empire, the hostel is also a good jumping off point for Notting Hill. Creatures of the night will enjoy the fact that the 24-hour reception means there's no curfew. Let the games begin. \u2022 15 Shepherd's Bush Green W12, +44 (0)20-8600 7500, st-christophers.co.uk, from \u00a319pp (three-, four- and seven-night deals available) Generator Russell Square Another locale appealing to those on a mission to suck the very last scrap of marrow out of life, the Generator declares itself \"London's largest, liveliest and funkiest hostel\". With more than 800 beds in mixed/female dorms and private rooms, the first of those claims is certainly true. Within easy reach of Leicester Square (and, for the more literary minded, the British Library), the hostel has a bar (to 2am), an internet caf\u00e9, chill-out room, games room and laundry facilities. London walking tours are free (as are the continental breakfasts), though the 18-35 crowd the hostel attracts are more likely to be found inside partying. \u2022 37 Tavistock Place WC1, +44 (0)20-7388 7666, generatorhostels.com, from \u00a323pp Meininger Hyde Park A self-styled \"hotel and hostel\", this German chain's first venture into Britain is a quiet riot of crisp minimalism, clean lines \u2013 and a whole lot of red. It's a surprise then to discover that it's in the historic Baden Powell House (there's a 15% discount for scouts). Actually a little way south of Hyde Park but bang opposite the Natural History Museum, Meininger has the usual single, double, shared or dormitory accommodation but with the twist that all rooms have their own private shower and toilet. Equipped with its own bar serving \"cider and sandwiches, muffins and cookies\", this is hostelling for guests who like everything just so. And why not? \u2022 65-67 Queen's Gate SW7, +44 (0)20-3318 1407, meininger-hotels.com, from \u00a322.50pp Astor Museum Inn So close to the British Museum guests can almost reach out and touch the Elgin Marbles, the Astor Museum Inn is based in one of those lovely old city mansions so undisturbed by the passing years one almost expects Beau Brummell to emerge at any moment. Rooms range from two to 12 beds and there's internet access, cooking facilities, no curfew and, for those who enjoyed the last century, a fax service. The only bad news is that this is a strictly 18s to 35s joint (and they will check your ID), so children and old timers will have to get their stolen Greek artefact kicks elsewhere. \u2022 27 Montague Street WC1, +44 (0)20-7580 5360, astorhostels.co.uk, from \u00a315pp (groups from \u00a312pp) The Lodge at Crystal Palace Set in 200 acres of parkland, the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre has been with us since 1964. The Lodge, a lone 10-storey tower in grounds, is not only the only way of staying in the park but is remarkably cheap for a hostel whose largest room sleeps just three. Plus, of course, there's the chance to run on the very same track that Usain Bolt has motored down or swim in the pool where Tom Daley dives (be sure to look up). To get in shape first, there's a state of the art gym (payasugym.com). Or you can just enjoy the park's famous dinosaur trail and maze. \u2022 Ledrington Road SE19, hostelworld.com, from \u00a320.90pp (including breakfast) \u2022 Dixe Wills is a travel writer for the Guardian, specialising in green and budget travel.
