Under the headline 'The Birth of Blameron', I declared that a politician who shamelessly stole Tony Blair's mannerisms and soundbites was doomed because the public had had it with the New Labour style. I dug out a splendid quote from a journalist from the Thirties who confronted a plausible but slippery politician with the bellow: 'You're phoney! Everything about you is phoney! Even your hair, which looks like a wig, isn't!' The voters would say the same about Cameron, I concluded. He was toast. Within days, he had taken the Conservative leadership by a landslide. He then stormed on to win a clear victory in the local elections. Never put money on my horses. My doubts about Cameron out-Blairing Blair nag on, however. For instance, his 'A-list' of candidates for safe seats seems like a ruthless imitation of control-freakery. He excluded experienced Tories in favour of a chick-lit novelist and a hunk from Coronation Street, presumably because they were loyalists who would look good on television. Yet Conservatives tell me that the interviews were a shambles. The interviewers didn't know what questions to ask and their choices made no sense. If this was a cold-blooded attempt to promote Cameron's people, they say, why didn't they select George Bridges in that case? He had all the qualifications of a loyalist, the fact that he worked for Cameron's private office being high among them. What looks like a pitiless exercise of power from a distance turns out to be a mess when you get closer. All very New Labour, now I come to think about it. www.nickcohen.net"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
