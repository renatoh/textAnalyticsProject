Modric\u2019s 25-yard volley secured victory in their opening Group D match in Paris on Sunday. Before the kick-off, he told Vedran Corluka the expectation to perform meant he was more relaxed in last month\u2019s triumphant European Cup final against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, as well as in the 2014 final, when Real also defeated their city rivals. The atmosphere at Parc des Princes was feverish throughout and Corluka said: \u201cIt means a lot to him [Modric]. We were just talking before the game when we saw our fans. It\u2019s such a big pressure to play for your country, it\u2019s ridiculous. He said: \u2018I played the final of the Champions League and I feel it\u2019s an easy game \u2013 when you play for your country people are unrealistic.\u2019 \u201cThey expect from him miracles. Of course he wants to do even better than for Real Madrid. He\u2019s playing in Real Madrid \u2013 second player or third player with [Gareth] Bale and [Cristiano] Ronaldo so you expect that [volley] from him. When you play with him, he\u2019s just ridiculous. Even against Turkey he\u2019s working so much for the team \u2013 in attack and defensively. He plays for Real Madrid, he\u2019s one of the best midfielders in Europe.\u201d Croatia are being inspired by the vaunted 1998 vintage of Davor Suker, Slaven Bilic and Zvonimir Boban, who met Ante Cacic\u2019s players before the tournament to offer encouragement. Eighteen years ago, Suker and co reached the semi-finals of a World Cup also staged in France and Corluka, who completed the game against Turkey despite a head injury, stated that side continue to be the benchmark. \u201cThey are the inspiration,\u201d the defender said. \u201cIf you read Croatian newspapers they always say we need to do something so we can forget about them but that team was so good. We were talking with them before the tournament. They said nice words, they encouraged us to do big things. It was nice to see them and to speak with them and to know they have our back. \u201cIt was Slaven, Suker, who is of course our president, Boban, every big star was there for our trip to France and said nice words so it was very encouraging for that.\u201d As well as Modric, the Croatia team also contain shining lights in Barcelona\u2019s Ivan Rakitic and Juventus\u2019s Mario Manduzkic, but Corluka is reluctant to bill Cacic\u2019s side as better than Miroslav Blazevic\u2019s 1998 vintage: \u201cI [can] say it\u2019s the best team because the players play in big clubs but compared to 1998 \u2013 some players there \u2013 Boban, [Robert] Prosinecki, Suker, [Aljosa] Asanovic, I think we need to eat a little bit more to come to that stage.\u201d Recollecting the 1998 semi-final in Paris, when Croatia lost 2-1 to France, Corluka, who is 30, said: \u201cI was on the grass somewhere when Suker scored in the semi-final and then I turned my head around and I saw it\u2019s 1-1 because [Lilian] Thuram equalised after 20 seconds. I remember when Prosinecki passed to Suker and he scored against Holland and we won third place and it is amazing to remember. \u201cI was in school, of course, but you know how is Croatia \u2013 even little kids and old people: everyone lives for football so you can imagine how it is now these days there. It is crazy and I hope everyone will get a little bit calmed down and don\u2019t expect straightaway big things from us. \u201cThe next game [on Friday] will be tough like this one. Czech Republic, they had a couple of great games in the qualifying group. They qualified I think they were second behind Iceland so we know they are a disciplined team but we will watch them [on Monday against Spain] and analyse them a little bit after.\u201d Corluka wants supporters to be soberer regarding expectations. \u201cWe are \u2013 a little bit \u2013 a nation who is unrealistic,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we need to calm down a little bit and go step by step because we have a good team, good players but the other teams have as well so let\u2019s calm down. It\u2019s just one win and nothing special.\u201d The defender is also confident his head wound will not rule him out of Friday\u2019s match. \u201cIt\u2019s good. I got a couple of stitches but now it\u2019s fine,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe had problem in the second half because every time I hit the ball with the head the blood started going again but now it\u2019s OK. I think it will not be an issue.\u201d This article was amended on 14 June. An earlier version stated that the Croatia coach is Victor Petkovic. It is Ante Cacic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
