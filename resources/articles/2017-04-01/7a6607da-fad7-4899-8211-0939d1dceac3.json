Chris Richardson, from Deloitte Access Economics, says compared with Australia\u2019s economic position heading into the global financial crisis, the official interest rate is already at a record low (1.5%), the dollar is already near its long-term average, the commonwealth budget is already billions of dollars in deficit, and household debt is already the second-highest in the world relative to incomes thanks to house prices hitting \u201cdangerously dumb\u201d levels. It means future stimulus spending would be far costlier for Australia\u2019s governments, and much harder to pursue, he says. Richardson will use a speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday to caution that Australia\u2019s leaders ought to be aware of such a scenario because it is one of a number of potential scenarios looming large. But he will also warn that governments and businesses have become so uncertain and fearful of the future their conservatism is risking making future generations less well off. He will say Deloitte\u2019s surveys of business leaders have found four out of five believe uncertainty is getting worse, and this needs to change. He has modelled a number of scenarios for Australia\u2019s economic future to make it easier for Australia\u2019s leaders to understand what may happen to the economy under certain conditions. This should help them become less fearful of the future, he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be as scared of the future, we just need to be better prepared for it,\u201d he says in notes seen by Guardian Australia. \u201cYou can fight uncertainty with better information, and once you look closely at a different future, it rapidly become less scary.\u201d Richardson has modelled three scenarios that he believes are plausible: a downturn in China\u2019s economy which sends Australia into recession; Asian economies perform better than expected while Australia\u2019s government has the courage to reform; and Australia gets better at being \u201ccyber smart\u201d. He says these scenarios are not the same as Deloitte\u2019s formal \u201cmost likely\u201d forecasts, which are produced quarterly. But the \u201cmost likely\u201d view of the future is far from a done deal, he says, which is why we also need to think about plausible outcomes. In the scenario where Asian economies perform better than expected, Richardson says more than $800bn could be added to Australia\u2019s national income over the next two decades, with wages lifting almost 2% more than prices, and employment rising by 1.5 percentage points. He predicts the boost in profits, and economic prospects, would encourage business to invest more, lifting business investment by 6 percentage points. \u201cBut that success would come with some costs attached, including a stronger Australia dollar and slightly higher interest rates,\u201d he says. \u201cThe next two decades won\u2019t simply see China\u2019s middle class get richer and buy more holidays in Australia, and less iron ore. It will also see the third and final wave of growth out of Asia hits its stride, with the rise of India, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines.\u201d Richardson says his \u201ckey message\u201d is that we shouldn\u2019t let ourselves be scared of the future and cling to playing it safe. \u201cI arrived in Canberra in the early 1980s, at exactly the time that some politicians, public servants and journalists realised that Australia could do better than it was doing. Between them, they convinced the electorate of the need for change, that some Plan Bs were much better than the status quo. \u201cThe result is ultimately today\u2019s Australia: much more successful, much better off, and about to pass the Dutch for a world record of growth. \u201cAnd yet we seemingly struggle to do the simple things in this town these days. So again I\u2019d say that thinking about alternative futures \u2026 is a way to help grind down the gridlock that\u2019s gripped out national political process.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
