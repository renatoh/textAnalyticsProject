The next one won\u2019t, Journal, 4 November), but it seems he has been blindsided too. He says this election will be fought primarily around the issues of Brexit, austerity and Scottish independence, or a combination thereof. Nowhere in the piece is there a single mention of the role of the climate emergency, despite a poll just last week flagging that this was very much in the minds of the British public (Climate crisis: Emergency \u2018to influence how people vote\u2019, 30 October). With more than half of people in the UK saying that the climate crisis will influence how they vote, rising to nearly three-quarters in the under-25s, it seems to me that this great issue of our time may, in fact, play a key role in deciding who next gets to sit in No 10 \u2013 and so it should. Bill McGuire Professor emeritus of geophysical and climate hazards, University College London \u2022 Marina Hyde derides the \u201cdangerous simplification\u201d of others (Three leaders for \u2018the people\u2019 and against \u2018the elite\u2019. Oh dear, Journal, 2 November) but indulges in an equally dangerous simplification of her own, suggesting Labour\u2019s \u201cpopulism\u201d is a mirror image of Tory and Brexit rhetoric. This kind of equivalence-mongering doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny. Most of the millions who vote Labour on 12 December will not be party members, supporters of Momentum, or Corbynistas; they will not have attended any rallies or meetings, or even watched the TV debates. They will be voting Labour because its policies \u2013 unsurprisingly for a democratic country\u2019s main left-of-centre party \u2013 promise greater economic and social benefits to more people (and especially to the less wealthy) than those of its opponents. To call this \u201cpopulism\u201d, in the sense that Johnson and Farage are populist, is playing games with language. Jon Griffith Hastings, East Sussex \u2022 Marina Hyde fails to separate the two \u201celites\u201d: (1) The financial elite (the people who are perceived to have the major influence over the country\u2019s capital) \u2013 these are the target for the left; (2) The intellectual elite (the people who are perceived to have the major influence over the country\u2019s thought) \u2013 these are the target for the right. A separation of these two \u201celites\u201d in political discourse is long overdue. Tony Hinkins Frodsham, Cheshire \u2022 There can be no fair democratic society without women\u2019s equality central to it. The one factor that should make a difference to the vote is where each party stands on policies for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, but your article omits this as a factor in predicting the election result (Confusing factors: An unpredictable race for No 10 has crucial hurdles for the whole field, 31 October). In 2010 the Conservatives abolished the Women\u2019s National Commission (WNC), in breach of the UK\u2019s international obligations under the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA), leaving UK women with no institutional mechanism to represent us. We women and girls have suffered most from the Tory austerity cuts, and female MPs face brutal abuse. We are more than 50% of the population, and we will vote for the party that most supports women\u2019s human rights and will restore the WNC, or its substitute, as required by international laws. We are ashamed, as we embark on the review of implementation of the BPfA 25 years after its adoption, that the UK is showing such indifference to this groundbreaking UN document to give women their human rights. The party that will support us women will have my vote. Margaret Owen Director, Widows for Peace through Democracy \u2022 When it comes to voting intentions, forget about Workington Man who threatens to forgo the Labour party and vote for a rightwing Tory who will destroy the remains of his life. Since the last election there have been three and half years of young people entering the voting register. They will be the deciding factor in this election. They are more aware of the environment and the effect on their future. Look out for a lot of surprises.
