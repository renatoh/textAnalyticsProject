Then, they went door to door with machetes, hunting down those seen as the wealthiest \u2013 the most educated first. When the house next door was burned down with his neighbours still inside, Timoth\u00e9e fled. Without a chance to grab his passport or phone, Timoth\u00e9e ran through the darkness of the bush of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, knowing he might never see his family or his fiancee again. When he reached a refugee settlement in Meheba, Zambia, in September, Timoth\u00e9e had no proof of his previous life. But now he has a little more hope about the future. In Zambia, a pilot qualifications passport scheme is being run by the government and the UN agency Unesco to help refugees access jobs or further education in the country by informally verifying their qualifications when they do not have crucial paperwork. A joint Unesco/UNHCR report found that fewer than 15% of migrants in developed countries say their level of education matches their jobs. In developing countries one in eight immigrants say that having their qualifications recognised is their greatest challenge in settling into new lives, more so than language, discrimination or even visa restrictions. Of the 60 who applied from his camp, Timoth\u00e9e was among 11 who reached the required standard. Summarising the holder\u2019s qualifications, experience and language skills, as well as any paperwork available, the qualifications passport is designed to help translate a refugee\u2019s qualifications to those in the host country. The scheme is due to be extended to Iraq and Colombia next year. Timoth\u00e9e feels his years of study and medical practice have at last been recognised. \u201cThe day I heard my qualifications had been accepted, I was so happy. I thanked God. It\u2019s a way for me to get my identity back,\u201d he says. Last week, Unesco member states adopted a new convention for \u201cfair, transparent and non-discriminatory recognition\u201d of higher education qualifications. Audrey Azoulay, Unesco\u2019s director general, says it is in everyone\u2019s interests to create a \u201csimple mechanism\u201d. \u201cFor governments, there is a clear fiscal argument against the squandering of human capital.\u201d Timoth\u00e9e has managed to let his family know where he is via Facebook on a borrowed phone. He has not yet been able to speak to his fiancee but has established through a friend that she is safe. He hopes he might move to a French-speaking country as it would be easier for him to practise medicine there. France would be nice, but he needs travel documents. He knows there are no guarantees yet, but is hopeful. \u201cDoors are opening for me again\u201d, he says. * Surname withheld on request."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
