The coach has also had a sly dig at the composition of the visiting team, saying he enjoyed hearing them described as the \u201cUnited Nations\u201d on the basis of the number of southern hemisphere-reared players involved. Jones, as ever keen to give the Irish stew a vigorous pre-match stir, is well aware the scrum will be a key area for the French referee Pascal Ga\u00fcz\u00e8re and does not want the Ireland tighthead Andrew Porter to win as many penalties as he did against Wales in Dublin last week. \u201cHe scrums in a fairly unusual way which may need some referee intervention, so we\u2019ll wait and see,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a referee who generally doesn\u2019t reward dominant scrums, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how he looks at that area. We\u2019ll need to be adaptable to his calls; it\u2019s no use scrummaging if you can\u2019t get a result out of it.\u201d While Jones is canny enough not to make direct accusations of cheating \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll leave that up to the referee\u201d \u2013 he clearly feels it is worth planting a seed of doubt in Ga\u00fcz\u00e8re\u2019s mind, no matter that such scrummaging mind games have traditionally been reserved for contests with Australia, nor that England have experienced relatively few recent problems in the fixture with three convincing wins in a row. Pausing only to pretend to forget the name of Ireland\u2019s home stadium \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s like when we go to Lansdowne Road, or whatever the commercial name is now \u2026\u201d \u2013 Jones also needed no second invitation to offer some thoughts on the fact a third of the visiting team \u2013 Bundee Aki, James Lowe and Jamison Gibson-Park from New Zealand and CJ Stander and Quinn Roux from South Africa \u2013 are qualified for Ireland via residency. England have captured more than a few players themselves over the years under the identical three-year regulation but anything that may make Ireland wince slightly en route to London seems to be fair game this week. \u201cI heard someone calling them the United Nations so I had a little chuckle,\u201d said Jones, with a wolfish grin. \u201cI can understand how Irish people would be upset about Irish-born players missing out. But they are the laws and regulations of international rugby; they are just sticking by the regulations.\u201d The biggest irony is that England are coached by an Australian and Ireland by one of England\u2019s all-time great rugby league players, Andy Farrell. Jones, though, fully expects the men in green to be fired up regardless of their places of birth, not least around the tackle area where he rates them as \u201cthe best poaching team in Europe\u201d. It explains a heavy-duty England starting pack, with only one change from the forwards who beat New Zealand in Japan last year. Joe Launchbury has earned the nod in the second row on this occasion, with the management belatedly revealing that Jonny Hill suffered a blow to the head in a training session before last week\u2019s Georgia game. The Exeter lock, consequently, must be content with a place on the bench where George Ford, Ben Earl and Max Malins are among a potentially exciting bunch of so-called \u201cfinishers\u201d. Jonathan Joseph also retains his place on the wing with young Ollie Lawrence at centre but, otherwise, England have plenty of experience in almost every position and are eager to crank things up following largely one-sided wins against Italy and Georgia. \u201cUnfortunately in rugby, you never get a head start from the previous game,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt would be nice if you got five minutes to play without any opposition but you don\u2019t, so it\u2019s always back to square one. \u201cYour diligence in looking at your team and making sure you\u2019ve got things right never stops. We got a lesson in the World Cup final about that. Every battle is a tough one. In 2017 we were going well and Ireland beat us for a grand slam. We\u2019ll never forget that. \u201cThese are different sized countries with different histories but the traditional rivalry is enormous and it needs to be respected. They\u2019ll be well prepared and come to Twickenham with a point to prove, which always makes them dangerous. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge step up from what we\u2019ve encountered in the last couple of games. Any England-Ireland game I\u2019ve been associated with has always been a contest up front. I can\u2019t see this being any different.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
