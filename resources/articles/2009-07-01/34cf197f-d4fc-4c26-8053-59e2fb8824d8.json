Peach, a 33-year-old teacher from New Zealand, died after a blow to the head at a demonstration against the National Front in Southall, west London, in 1979. No officers were charged although six members of the Metropolitan police's riot squad, the Special Patrol Group, were suspected. The unit was led by Alan Murray, a 29-year-old inspector who resigned shortly afterwards and is now a lecturer in corporate responsibility at Sheffield University. He denied killing Peach, and said that he did not believe anyone in his unit was responsible. Now 59, Murray claimed the Met's investigation \u2013 which focused on those SPG officers near Peach when he collapsed \u2013 was flawed. \"I resigned because of the way the investigation was conducted,\" he said. \"It is a matter of abiding regret that Blair Peach was killed that day.\" Asked what caused Peach's death, he said: \"Blair Peach was either murdered or unlawfully killed \u2013 there is no doubt in my mind.\" The verdict of death by misadventure at Peach's inquest, he said, was \"inappropriate\". The notorious death has come under renewed scrutiny since the death in April at the G20 protests of Ian Tomlinson, a newspaper vendor who collapsed after being attacked by the Met's riot squad \u2013 now the Territorial Support Group. Peach's partner of 10 years, Celia Stubbs, called for the release of a secret Met report into the death written by John Cass, the commander who ran the complaints bureau. Cass, 84 and living in Wales, said he was not opposed to disclosure of the document, which would reveal the names of the officers he considered suspects. Two weeks later Sir Paul Stephenson, the Met commissioner, told a meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority, which called for the release of the report, that he would seek to make it public. The report could prove highly embarrassing for the Met. Eleven witnesses said they saw its officers attack Peach on a suburban street in Southall, west London, on 23 April 1979. A pathologist report said the injury to his skull was likely to have been caused by a lead weighted rubber cosh or hosepipe filled with lead shot. When Cass raided lockers at the SPG headquarters, he uncovered a stash of unauthorised weapons, including a metal cosh, but it was not the weapon that killed Peach. Cass compiled a report for prosecutors, who decided against charging any officer over the death. Cass was reported to have believed certain officers should be prosecuted for causing affray and others charged for obstruction of justice. Murray resigned complaining that Cass did not follow investigative procedures. After some years working in his brother's jewellery business, he trained as an accountant. He returned to university in his 40s and is now an expert in corporate responsibility. In an interview, he said Peach's death had affected his life, and it was \"no coincidence\" that his academic focus became ethics. \"There has hardly been a day gone by since when it hasn't crossed my mind.\" The death of Tomlinson \"did bring everything back\", he said. \"The actions of police at the G20 appalled me.\" Murray refused to give a detailed account of his actions on the night Peach died until the Met releases the Cass report, which he believes may have significant redactions. He stressed that he was never arrested, suspended from duty or interviewed under caution by Cass."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
