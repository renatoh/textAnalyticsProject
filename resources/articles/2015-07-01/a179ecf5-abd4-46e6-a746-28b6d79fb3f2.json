The England international has been below his best this year in a largely inconsistent season for Wigan, but two try assists and a perfect record from the kicking tee \u2013 including that dramatic late penalty with just 45 seconds remaining \u2013 underlined his importance to the club on a night where they needed just about everything they had to put Leeds to bed and move within two points of the league leaders. The fact that all three outcomes were still possible with less than a minute left emphasised what a superb advert for Super League this was; the destination of the two points ebbed and flowed throughout the 80 minutes, but ultimately it was Smith that secured what was a deserved win for Wigan, who remain unbeaten at home in the league this season. The Wigan coach Shaun Wane said: \u201cI thought we deserved to win \u2013 the best team won. Credit to Leeds; they\u2019re a fantastic team and they\u2019re quite rightly sitting at the top of Super League. But I genuinely thought the better team won \u2013 we bombed some chances but I\u2019m very happy to get the win.\u201d As for Leeds, they will sit back and reflect on this defeat and wonder what might have been. That late penalty and a controversial disallowed try in the first half proved the difference on a night where they just weren\u2019t quite at their best. The Leeds coach Brian McDermott said: \u201cI\u2019ve no complaints with the loss. We were flat in the first half; there were some tremendous periods but defensively we didn\u2019t have enough bite about us \u2013 that\u2019s where the game was won and lost really.\u201d The hooker Paul Aiton put Leeds into an early lead after 10 minutes when he dived over from dummy-half courtesy of some uncharacteristically slack Wigan defending, but two tries in three minutes from Liam Farrell and the captain Sean O\u2019Loughlin turned the game. Yet the impressive Adam Cuthbertson then fired a superb pass for prop Brad Singleton to barge over for Leeds, with Kevin Sinfield\u2019s second conversion levelling it up at 12-12. Leeds then felt they should have gone back in front when Danny McGuire crossed after more sensational play from Cuthbertson, only for the video referee to chalk the try off due to obstruction. Wigan took advantage, and subsequently the half-time lead courtesy of a try from Matty Bowen. A pinpoint kick from Smith 10 minutes after the restart allowed Josh Charnley to touch down and extend Wigan\u2019s lead, but Leeds showed spirit and guile to fight their way back into the contest. However, they could only produce a solitary try from Ash Handley in a dominant 20-minute spell. They kept pressing late on, and after plenty of pressure on the Wigan line, it finally told when Rob Burrow exploited some tired defending. Sinfield\u2019s conversion then made it 24-24 with just three minutes left. Leeds looked the more likely to claim the win, but when Aiton was adjudged to have obstructed a Wigan defender to enable Carl Ablett to break, the referee Richard Silverwood pulled the play back and gave Smith the simplest of opportunities to win it for Wigan. He did not miss, and there was barely enough time for Leeds to kick off before the hooter sounded to hand Wigan a potentially huge victory come the season\u2019s end.
