Edward Timpson spoke out after a serious case review into the starvation of Hamzah Khan concluded that while his death was \"not predictable\", Bradford social services missed some signs which could have warned that Hamzah and his seven siblings were at risk. The report does not blame any one agency for failing Hamzah, with the authors making 50 recommendations for \"learning\" which have been accepted by the Bradford Safeguarding Children Board. Timpson said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the report, which he says blamed no one and contained \"glaring absences\". In a letter to Nick Frost, an independent academic from Leeds Metropolitan university who chaired the review, the minister asked questions about 10 instances when Bradford children's social care may have missed opportunities to help Hamzah and his seven siblings. \"In particular, I am concerned that it fails to explain sufficiently clearly the actions taken, or not taken by children's social care when problems in the Khan family were brought to their attention on a number of occasions,\" Timpson said. A source from the Department for Education used even stronger language, describing the review as \"risible\". Publicly, the DfE's criticism was welcomed by Bradford council, with Kath Tunstall, director of children's services saying \"stringent questions\" would help in the process of learning lessons for the future. But privately the council is believed to be fuming, with a source there accusing the government of \"social worker bashing\". It is understood that DfE officials had accepted the report two days ago and had asked most of Timpson's questions a few days ago \u2013 and had received answers. Hamzah's mother, Amanda Hutton, 44, was found guilty last month of his manslaughter and of neglecting five of her seven surviving children. When Hamzah's partially mummified body was found in September 2011, almost two years after his death in December 2009, aged four, he was wearing a babygro meant for a child aged six to nine months. The house was in such a squalid state that the children, some badly malnourished and with head lice and fungal infections, had to wade through rubbish to reach their urine-sodden beds. Neither Hamzah nor any of his siblings were on social services' \"at risk\" register, though the authorities were aware of the existence of all eight children. Two months before his death he and his family had been struck off their GP's list for persistent non-attendance. Like Victoria Climbi\u00e9, the eight-year-old girl tortured and murdered by her great-aunt in London in 2000, Hamzah had never visited a GP. As in the Climbi\u00e9 case, and that of Baby P, who died in 2007 after being abused by his mother and her partner, there were insufficient challenges to Hamzah's mother when she refused help. Hutton's deliberate decision to withdraw him from all of the usual and universal services was a significant factor in his death and why she was able to hide it for so long, the report says. The experts examining Hamzah's case found that in late 2006, when he was one-and-a-half, one of his older siblings went to the police complaining that Hutton and her partner, Aftab Khan \u2013 father to all eight children \u2013 had assaulted him. Police used their powers of protection to try to arrange safe accommodation with Bradford children's social care. But they were unable to find a placement and the boy returned home. In March 2007 the same child appeared at the magistrates court on charges of theft and deception and was remanded \"as directed\" and placed with specialist foster carers for two nights before being returned home. Timpson asked in each case: \"Was the child assessed by children's social care? If not, why not?\" He repeated the question in relation to the handling of another complaint of physical and emotional abuse made by the same older boy in May 2007 which was interpreted by social workers as being \"teenage angst\" rather than something more serious. He spent two nights in emergency accommodation before being returned back to the family home by the end of the month. Two years later Hamzah was dead, left to rot in his cot, his siblings told to lie to everyone and say he had moved to Portsmouth, or Peterborough or Southampton. Social workers had been told Hamzah and two of Hutton's other young children were staying with relatives but no checks were made with any relevant agencies in these three locations, the SCR found. When an anonymous referral was made to the police in March 2011 of someone shouting and swearing at the children, social workers did not investigate, wrongly claiming that the youngest children \"had been placed in Portsmouth\". The family had received help from a host of agencies, including the police, probation service, a domestic violence charity called Staying Put, the Yorkshire ambulance service, Bradford Children and Young People's services and Bradford Early Years Children's Services as well as various health services. They were also the subject of a so-called Marac, a multi agency risk assessment conference. Many referrals were made to CSC from a number of these agencies, but the children were never assessed as being of significant risk of harm.. All of the agencies focused their efforts on Hutton as a victim of domestic violence, rather than her children, the SCR panel found. The experts report that while much help was offered to Hamzah's mother, who was beaten up by her partner for much of their 22-year relationship, not enough focus was put on whether her children were safe and well. The SCR authors found that Hutton's reluctance to accept help was poorly understood and that \"insufficient attention\" was given to the implications of factors such as domestic violence and substance misuse on the children and their emotional as well as physical care and well being. A police officer who did gain access to Hutton's house in the March before Hamzah died reported that her children seemed \"safe and well\", despite at least one child not having a bed to sleep in. The SCR also found that social workers were too ready to accept Hutton's word when she refused intervention or support, missing appointments and refusing access to the family home. A \"more assertive\" approach, the authors write, would have given more explicit consideration to the needs of the children and probably sought to override parental objections, perhaps even going to court for an appropriate order. The SCR said the various agencies did not share information readily enough. \"The lack of joined up assessment, information sharing and thinking, meant there were missed opportunities for multi-agency action to help this family and protect the children,\" the authors write. Responding to the review on Wednesday, Dame Clare Tickell, chief executive at Action for Children, said it was vital experts listen to children rather than just adults: \"Children at risk of dying at the hands of their parents are crying out for help but they aren't being heard.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
