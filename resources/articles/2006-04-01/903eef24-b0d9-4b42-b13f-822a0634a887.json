Racy coverlines - \"I blew crippled hubby's fortune on fake boobs\"; \"I beat breast cancer blues by pole dancing\"; \"Dead because mum didn't eat a choccy biscuit\" - plus puzzles, recipes and prize giveaways. There's a touch more muscle and glamour and the cover paper doesn't feel as thin as usual. But what really stands out is the ads for the News of the World in every issue - \"If You Love It, You'll Love News of the World!\" \"Don't Miss This Sunday's Free DVD!\" The reason they are so prominent is simple - Love It! is owned by News Magazines, which is owned by News International. Suddenly, having a newsstand magazine business is the newspaper equivalent of owning a fluffy lapdog in Hollywood. Three weeks ago Associated Newspapers started selling a lightly reversioned You magazine in London and the south-east, while Trinity Mirror is rumoured to have a real life magazine, called Reality, in an advanced stage of development. Of course, the newspaper industry has a slightly sticky track record in this area. Almost every group has owned or launched stand-alone mags over the past 10 years and very few of them survive. In 2000 Associated newspapers set up an ill-fated contract publishing division, while News International has made two previous attempts to launch into the world of the glossy. All failed miserably. Powerful figures at paper groups have decided to give it a go, however. Industry rumour has it that You's launch is largely down to Lord Rothermere's personal interest in the idea; at News International, the News Magazines subsidiary is very much the personal dream of Camilla Rhodes, a former managing director of the Sun and the News of the World and now CEO at News Mags. To the chagrin of some magazine giants such as Emap, the launched titles seem to have begun life relatively successfully - or at least, more successfully than their predecessors - mainly because management recruited magazine journalists to staff them rather than moving newspaper hacks into the role. \"It does make me smile that Rupert Murdoch should decree the future is not in newspapers and suddenly realise the attraction of the bond between magazines and their readers,\" says Jackie Newcombe, managing director of IPC's South Bank Group. \"Nonetheless, they are spending significant sums - something like \u00a36m to launch Inside Out, with a target circulation of 70-100,000. That's a massive investment. Obviously the company is having to learn some new skills pretty quickly. Putting coverlines on a newspaper supplement is a completely different skill from selling your mag via the coverlines on a cluttered newsstand.\" As far as the city is concerned, there seem to be two main reasons for this sudden burst of activity - cross-promotion and a means of exploiting existing editorial/paper buying expertise to produce cheaper versions than competitors could afford. \"Launching News Magazines was a natural move for NI,\" according to Les Hinton, executive chairman of News International. \"We are always looking at new platforms for the content we can create and the magazine market presents lots of opportunities to reach new readers. Our brands provide opportunities for different platforms to complement each other, as well as cross-promote, but we also have strong foundations on which to innovate and efficiently bring new products to market. We're looking at a wide spectrum of areas for future launches.\" Love It! was launched at the start of February this year and its upmarket relative, Sunday Times Inside Out, followed at the end of the month. Inside Out is a glossy homes and interiors monthly launched after reader research found a demand for such editorial but little that satisfied. Heavily cross-promoted by a taster issue distributed free with the paper, the mag is priced at a respectable \u00a33.20 and boasts an editorial team drawn from Hachette and Cond\u00e9 Nast. Both aim to target readers who think the current offering is too downmarket. \"Our ideal reader is a young woman, 25 plus, who hasn't been reading real-life magazines as they seem too old and trashy for her,\" says Augusta Barnes, Love It!'s publisher. \"We've increased the quality of the cover, added features on plastic surgery, men and sex and upped the quality of the fashion to allow them into a market they felt was too fusty for them.\" Adland has responded cautiously, noting that Love It! began life refusing to take downmarket direct response advertising but recently caved in and grabbed the extra cash. \"I wonder if they would have done that if revenue was hitting target,\" speculated one media buyer. Even so, the idea of a Sunday Times-brand interiors magazine has been broadly welcomed. Over at Associated Newspapers, the newsstand launch of the Mail on Sunday's You magazine is a slightly confusing business. Telly ads for the mag suggest it is a stand-alone launch, while the editor's letter constantly reminds readers that they could have got their mag for free had they bought the previous weekend's Mail on Sunday. \"There are plenty of women who don't buy newspapers and they're pretty much in our target audience,\" explains You editor Sue Peart. \"They'll be weekly magazine consumers, however, and will probably buy more than one. We think You will be an attractive entrant - there are a huge number of noisy, celebtastic magazines out there, while You is more thoughtful. We've got longer lead times, we're more glamorous and glossy. Grazia is a harder, newsier mag, so we think people can buy both.\" For You's launch, 100,000 copies were available in London and the south-east and, in four weeks, circulation has risen to 30,000 with a slight boost in Mail on Sunday circulation. \"If they don't hit 40-50,000 I'd say they've failed,\" says Dominic Williams, press director at Carat. \"Although certainly our fashion clients, Debenhams and Arcadia group, are excited by it. It's good when media owners take risks and it might make Emap squeal - they've owned that market for years - but a bit of competition in that sector is a good thing as far as we're concerned.\" While agencies report concern at Emap, IPC's Newcombe is relatively sanguine about these newcomers. She doesn't expect lobbying from magazine publishers akin to commercial radio's 90s fury at the BBC's cross-promotion of local radio stations after its national news. \"Of course, they've got advantages, but they're hindered by newspaper thinking,\" she says. \"I don't mind if there's fresh competition bringing new readers to a sector. For us, who have far more experience of publishing magazines, that represents an opportunity.\" Even so, it seems a little curious, and somehow heart-warming, in an era when newspapers are supposed to be moving everything online to find that Murdoch at least considers glossy glamour mags to be as much a part of his strategic vision as a multimillion-dollar purchase of the peer-to-peer site myspace. The only question is - what will other newspaper publishers do? Will the Daily Express launch a Diana Conspiracy Monthly? Breast and Breastmen from the Sport?
