Her new chamber group, formed in 2000, is different from previous companies, and her latest work seems influenced by her successful Broadway show Movin' Out. No, she's not selling out but she is selling her dancers short on content, if not on aerobic workouts. They include Matthew Dibble, who left the Royal Ballet four years ago to join Tetsuya Kumakawa's K Ballet in Japan. He's become Tharp's bravura ballet boy, competing in the virtuoso stakes with Charlie Neshyba-Hodges, too compact (and bald) to be a danseur noble, though he can do all the steps and more. Knowing that Dibble is English compounds my problem with this talented group. Why do they need to sell Tharp's work so hard, grinning and mouthing like all-American hoofers? Dibble partners Lynda Sing in a pas de deux from Known By Heart, which Tharp created for American Ballet Theatre. It's one of those duets in which ballet dancers let you know they're regular folks having a spat while executing tricky technical feats. Already too cute by half, the jokes don't need to be signalled: leave the wit to the choreography. Similar mugging mars Westerly Round, a mini-Oklahoma number for a tomboy heroine and three corn-fed suitors, with Hodges as the put-upon junior. Emily Coates is delectable as the impish girl bubbling along on a torrent of steps to Mark O'Connor's fiddle music. She creates a genuine character, albeit one belonging in a playground rather than a grown-up square dance party. This is Tharp-lite for family matin\u00e9es. Even The Fugue (1970), most cerebral of the pieces in the first half of the programme, is gussied up as fun. In its original incarnation, it was an austere exercise driven by sound, with no accompaniment, other than the three performers' foot slaps and handclaps as they worked their way through variations on a 20-count theme. It has now become a dance show, in which two men and a woman vie to perform the sequences as airily as possible. When their footfalls coincide at the end of a phrase, there's an air of drama instead of mathematical inevitability. The first half turns out to be Tharp as entertainer, warming us up for Surfer at the River Styx (2000) after the interval. Maybe this is how she chooses to present her work around the States, persuading audiences that dancers are vaudevillians at heart. Look how they try to please! But Londoners, who love American energy, don't need to have it socked to them so vehemently. Surfer at the River Styx is her dark, apocalyptic piece. The commissioned score is by Donald Knaack, whose Junk Music was used for the Known by Heart duet. He creates percussive music from found objects, just as Tharp's choreography yokes disparate elements together. The surfer of the title is Hodges in baggy shorts, flinging himself into the air as though catapulted from his board. He's a demented creature, persecuted by a black-clad chorus of four: they could represent the underworld river of Greek mythology or the Bacchae. Here's where the allegory becomes impenetrable, for a second figure, Dibble, is also involved in crossing to the afterlife. Protagonist and antagonist battle as dance rivals, spinning spectacularly in balletic tours \u00e0 la seconde. Yet, with Knaack's disco beat, they could be out of their minds in a club in hell. Demons bear them away, only to return as blessed spirits for an apotheosis. Tharp loves a redemptive ending. Knaack is junked in favour of saintly music by David Kahme; hubristic men are replaced by a woman in white, raised aloft to catch a beam of light. If there's a Dionysian moral about healing in the new millennium, it's an obscure one. \u00b7 Three to see English National Ballet, Sadler's Wells, London EC1 (Tue-Sat) World premiere of Michael Corder's Melody on the Move, followed by Ronald Hynd's sunny Coppelia.
