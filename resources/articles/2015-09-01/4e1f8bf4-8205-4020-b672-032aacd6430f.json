Often, that demand is a gut-level response to a complex problem and, as the shock of the image subsides, nothing is done. In this instance, the reverberations provoked a belated shift in our government\u2019s response to the migrant crisis. What it, and the accompanying series of images, said, in a way that words had failed to do, was: how could it have come to this? These are, of course, not the first photos of suffering to carry this kind of emotive charge. One thinks of Nick Ut\u2019s image from 1972 of a naked nine-year-old fleeing an American army napalm attack on her village. Or the late Chris Hondros\u2019s visceral shot of a five-year-old Iraqi girl, Samar Hassan, screaming and splattered with blood, just after her parents had been killed when American soldiers opened fire on their car. Or, perhaps most disturbing of all in its intimation of extreme suffering, Kevin Carter\u2019s gut-wrenching photograph of a Sudanese child, emaciated with hunger, her head resting on the earth, as a vulture stands by as if waiting for her to die. (Carter won a Pulitzer prize for the image, but was also criticised for his perceived callousness. \u201cThe man adjusting his lens to take just the right frame of her suffering,\u201d declared the St Petersburg Times in Florida, \u201cmight just as well be a predator, another vulture on the scene.\u201d Two months after receiving the prize, Carter, suffering from depression and haunted by what he had experienced as a photojournalist, took his own life.) \u201cBecause children are vulnerable and blameless \u2013 the purest victims \u2013 depictions of their suffering have an extraordinarily visceral impact,\u201d writes the American academic and essayist Susie Linfield in her thought-provoking book, The Cruel Radiance: Photography and Political Violence. \u201cAnd so they should. It is not naivete or sentimentality to be moved, pierced or outraged by such images.\u201d There are, though, many ways to be outraged by an image as visceral as that of the lifeless body of a three-year-old boy washed up on a beach. One can be moved by the image, while also finding it problematic in its apparent callousness and intrusion. (I had to search hard to find out who took the photograph. It was Nilufer Demir, a photographer with Turkey\u2019s Dogan News Agency, who came upon Aylan\u2019s body while crossing the beach in Bodrum. \u201cThere was nothing left to do for him... nothing but take his photograph,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is the only way I can express the scream of his silent body\u2019.\u201d) Our media outlets reflected the problematic nature of the photograph, weighing up its potential power to offend as well as move hearts. The Guardian and the Independent published the original wide shot of the child\u2019s body on the sand next to a policeman who seems to be texting \u2013 or taking a photograph? \u2013 on his mobile. Other papers chose to pixellate the dead child\u2019s head and face, while some chose not to publish the image at all, instead using what many would consider a more humane shot of a policeman cradling the dead child in his arms. Online, the image was disseminated often in a cropped version that homed in close on the child\u2019s body. In all of this, one could sense an uncertainty about the image that was most apparent in the Independent\u2019s decision to run an accompanying justification for its use. (\u201cThe Independent has taken the decision to publish these images because, among the often glib words about the \u2018ongoing migrant crisis\u2019, it is all too easy to forget the reality of the desperate situation facing many refugees.\u201d) In the accompanying article, though, Aylan Kurdi did not yet have a name, but was referred to as a \u201cchild, thought to be Syrian\u201d and \u201cone of 12 Syrian refugees\u201d. It is not just photographs that can rob people of their dignity and dehumanise. In a wider context, the chief rabbi\u2019s heartfelt contention about the power of the image touches on another issue that has dogged photography almost since its inception and has become even more urgent in today\u2019s endlessly mediated, globally connected world: do extreme and distressing images of human suffering make us more aware of the reality of that suffering or desensitise us to it? When she wrote On Photography, Sontag thought the latter, but when she revisited the topic in a later book, Regarding the Pain of Others, her view had shifted. \u201cAs much as they create sympathy, I wrote, photographs shrivel sympathy,\u201d she mused. \u201cIs this true? I thought it was when I wrote it. I\u2019m not so sure now.\u201d Perhaps it depends on the photograph. And its subject. And on the social context from which it emerges and sometimes helps to clarify through the creation of a single, defining image. We already knew enough about the refugee crisis to know that countless people have perished in their desperate attempts to reach the safe haven that Europe now represents, but this was dreadfully intimate, cruel, incontrovertible evidence. Perhaps it took an image as distressing as this to humanise the many. This, too, is part of the power of a photograph: to force us to look when all our instincts are to look away. \u201cPhotographs of children are no more meaningful \u2013 that is, politically explanatory \u2013 than any others,\u201d writes Linfield, \u201cStill, these images call forth intuitive responses of pity and outrage, though these emotions may not always know where to land.\u201d In this instance, it seemed that, for once, they did.
