At 6ft 2in, and a quickish right-arm with a well controlled outswinger and jagging breakback off the seam, he became, in 1936, the first bowler for 39 years to take 200 wickets in a season. For good measure, he repeated the feat the following summer. In a first-class career of 20 years, interrupted by the second world war, he took 1,555 wickets at an average of 23.63, and played in four Tests for England. Against Worcestershire in 1935, he took four wickets with successive deliveries. His batting was less noteworthy, although he once opened the batting with Jack Hobbs, lasted out the evening, and, with monumental concentration, made it some way into the next morning, before Hobbs, in frustration, told him to get out so that they could all get on with the game. Gover's name, however, became synonymous with coaching, and he attracted many of the world's finest players to his indoor school, set back from a garage on East Hill, in Wandsworth, south London. Viv Richards was a pupil, as were Andy Roberts, Garry Sobers, Frank Tyson, Ian Bishop, Rohan Kanhai, Tom Graveney, Ken Barrington and the teenaged Brian Lara. The school was founded in 1928, the year Gover made his county debut, by Bill Brooke, (his future father-in-law) in partnership with two Surrey and England cricketers, Andy Sandham and Herbert Strudwick. When Strudwick retired in 1938, Gover bought his share; in 1946, he acquired Sandham's as well, purchasing the premises in 1954. The Gover cricket school was to run until September 1989, when, with his son John, who ran a successful cricket retailing side to the business, Alf decided to retire. The school, old-fashioned even in the earlier days, was a world away from the playing environment of those international players who occasionally augmented the regular trade of club players and schoolboys - and, occasionally, girls. The steep, narrow stairs, climbing from an unprepossessing side entrance, led first to a snooker room and small bar, and then to the door of a locker-lined changing room, smelling of leather, linseed and linament, from which could be heard the echoing clunk of bat on ball. There were four nets, low-beamed and, at one time, gas-lit. Gover was a patrician figure - upright, immaculate, with swept-back silver hair, England sweater pulled down long and usually a silk cravat knotted at his throat. His technical expertise was immense, but his bread and butter were the basics. Many who went to his classes as boys will remember his mantra of \"Bat up, one to drive\" and the kindly words of encouragement afterwards, even to the biggest duffers. In 1952, he began a parallel career, writing for Thomson's Weekly, and then the Sunday Mirror, for whom he covered Len Hutton's triumphant Ashes tour of 1954-55, as well as later Australian tours of 1958-59 and 1965-66. Gover claims that it was his suggestion to Hutton that led to Frank Tyson cutting down his run to devastating effect. He also did expert summaries for BBC Radio between 1949-55, was technical adviser during the filming of Terence Rattigan's The Final Test (1953), and, much to his delight, sneaked a role as an extra in an episode of the television series Bergerac. In 1937-38, Gover toured India with Lionel Tennyson's MCC team and delighted in telling the story of how, struggling with dysentery but persuaded to play, he had followed his long run to the crease that began his opening over by bolting past the batsman, and still clutching the new ball, sprinting across the outfield, up the pavilion steps and into the changing rooms. \"All to no avail, old boy,\" he would say, \"I lost by two yards.\" Born at Woodcote, Epsom, on a leap year day, Gover had a season on the Essex staff before moving to the Oval in 1927. He did war service in the Army Physical Training Corps, before transferring to the Pioneer Corps, and attaining the rank of major. In 1932, he married Marjorie Brooke, whose father had given his financial backing to the original East Hill Indoor Cricket School. She predeceased him, and he is survived by two sons and a daughter.
