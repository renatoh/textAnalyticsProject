I was slowly losing the plot\u2019", "bodyText": "Nearly five years ago, I saw One Direction live. Twice, on consecutive nights \u2013 on the first two dates of their On the Road Again world tour. Once was for work, to review the show. The other was for the sheer, heady, sugar-rush pleasure. I was, I\u2019ll admit, a little on the old side for a Directioner, even then. Most of the 45,000-odd crowd was much younger \u2013 not that that you would necessarily be able to tell from the saucy suggestions on their homemade signs. \u201cI don\u2019t want to draw attention to them,\u201d Liam Payne had said fussily on stage. It was an on-brand comment for the then-21-year-old Payne, who, had the harried, slightly anxious energy of a father-of-four at Disneyland. And no wonder: it was clear, even to me, that Zayn Malik had checked out, barely bothering to conceal his rolling eyes. He would be gone within the month, marking the beginning of the end (or \u201cindefinite hiatus\u201d) for the biggest boy band in the world. \u201cIt was a point where every day, you didn\u2019t know whether it was going to be the end,\u201d says Payne, sitting in the offices of his PR company in central London. \u201cIt was so touch and go, at every single show. I was slowly losing the plot.\u201d Now 26 and almost totally tattooed, Payne has a new album on which he raps about getting rowdy on Bacardi and being \u201cfree\u201d from 1D. At the same time his very-nearly-naked form is plastered on buses and train stations in a provocative ad campaign for Hugo Boss. Yet Payne is as polite and agreeable as if he were talking to his best friend\u2019s mother. He is tired he says after an energetic early morning music video shoot. \u201cThere was a trampoline involved,\u201d he says, sucking on his silver Juul. \u201cIt was hell \u2013 but it will look great.\u201d Gym beast and sex symbol are relatively new tags. His role as the diplomat of the group was established from the time they were first assembled from five solo applicants on The X Factor in 2010. Payne auditioned when he was just 14, but was told by Simon Cowell to \u201ccome back in two years\u201d. He did \u2013 and, eyes serious beneath his enormous fringe, blew the judges away with a brassy rendition of Cry Me a River. Growing up in Wolverhampton, he had been a talented cross-country runner. But a fan of Usher, Justin Timberlake and Chris Brown, he was drawn to singing as \u201cthe thing that made my parents proudest\u201d. His backup plan, had he not got through on X Factor, was to follow his father into an aircraft fitting factory. Once grouped in One Direction it took the five boys, then between 16 and 19, to pull together. \u201cAt the start we couldn\u2019t get past our own egos,\u201d says Payne. There would be fights over who got to sing what part, and even personal style. \u201cEverybody had their own little thing \u2013 it was like having four older brothers.\u201d Payne went on to write songs for the group, contributing to two-thirds of their 2014 album Four (arguably their best) and even earning a production credit on 2015\u2019s Made in the AM. But in the early days he would be the one to sing the opening part because, he was told at the time, he \u201cused to settle everybody\u201d. Payne says he was a more experienced performer than the other boys, and a \u201cbit more mature\u201d \u2013 which he puts down to spending more time with his dad than his peers, and being so focused on a career in showbusiness. \u201cI\u2019d lived a different lifestyle from 14 to 16. Most kids try alcohol and experiment \u2013 I never did any of that because I thought there\u2019s a chance that I might make it.\u201d Management took advantage of this, he says, telling him his \u201cvery specific role\u201d in the group was to keep the rest in line. \u201cI was like, that\u2019s great, innit \u2013 because then everyone in the band thinks I\u2019m a dick.\u201d He remembers one of the band\u2019s first hotel stays. \u201cWe\u2019ve got plates being thrown out the window, mattresses being ridden down the stairs, and I\u2019m getting calls from the manager saying: \u2018You need to sort it out\u2019.\u201d It wasn\u2019t lost on the fans. Where Malik and Styles were the heartthrobs, Payne says he was classed as Mr Boring. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at the stadium, and if you get the least screams, it\u2019s like: \u2018For fuck\u2019s sake.\u2019\u201d After a year playing 1D-Dad he gave up and learned to have fun. \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat them, join them\u201d \u2013 at which point, he notes wryly, the band\u2019s public image became more cheeky and carefree. \u201cAnd the more fun we had, the more successful it got.\u201d He recalls performing to sold-out stadiums night after night, seeing \u201chundreds\u201d of iPhones being thrown onstage in the vain hopes of their being returned with a selfie. \u201cIt\u2019s like the kids just lost their minds.\u201d \u201cThere were parts of it that were a bit shit, like there is with anything,\u201d he says, \u201cand there were parts of it that was just euphoria.\u201d He recalls seeing 15,000 fans camped outside his hotel room in Lima, Peru. Security had advised them to stay inside all day, and because \u201cthey were the adults, we thought they were in charge. Then over time we started to figure out that they weren\u2019t, and that\u2019s when we used to run off.\u201d Yet the adrenaline peaks of performing, followed by long troughs of tedium, were akin to a drug addiction, says Payne. He turned to alcohol. \u201cDoing a show to however many thousands of people, then being stuck by yourself in a country where you can\u2019t go out anywhere \u2013 what else are you going to do? The minibar is always there. \u201d For a time, he was also taking an epilepsy drug as a mood stabiliser that he says affected his cognitive functioning under certain lights. Payne says he had been well advised to take it, to counter the \u201cerratic highs and lows\u201d he was experiencing \u2013 \u201cI just needed a little bit of help to keep me stable\u201d \u2013 \u201cbut under certain lights on stage or during interviews, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell them my name\u201d. The day we meet, Payne has made headlines for telling Ant Middleton on the pair\u2019s Sky One show that the loneliness of fame had \u201calmost nearly killed\u201d him. When Middleton asked Payne if he had ever wanted to act on those feelings, Payne said that he had: \u201c100%\u201d. He is not inclined to discuss this today, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a bit dark,\u201d he says, a touch brusquely \u2013 \u201cbut yeah, it was very touch and go at times\u201d. This was both in 1D and afterwards, he clarifies. As One Direction got bigger and bigger, he says, \u201cI was like: \u2018I don\u2019t really know how to deal with this\u2019. Once you start, you can\u2019t really press the stop button.\u201d The \u201cindefinite hiatus\u201d button, though, was easier \u2013 in mid-2015, four months after Malik\u2019s departure, the band made the decision together. \u201cIt was a little bit dark and twisted towards the end of it,\u201d says Payne, \u201cbut the last few shows were really beautiful moments because the pressure cooker had been let off. \u201cIt was almost like counting down to holiday \u2013 we were going to wake up that Monday morning with no schedule.\u201d Afterwards Payne was in therapy for two years, and took six months off. \u201cIt was difficult at the start, because I didn\u2019t really know anything about myself. It was a bit of a numb feeling.\u201d In early 2016, he started dating Cheryl Cole, 10 years his senior, and one of the X Factor judges to be wowed by his audition. He is vague about whether he thought coverage of the age gap in their relationship was sexist (\u201cFor me it\u2019s like, you love who you love\u201d), though he notes that the online rumour mill is now trying to claim his new girlfriend \u2013 19-year-old model Maya Henry, whose face in close-up is his iPhone wallpaper \u2013 is younger than she is. His son with Cole, Bear, will turn three in March. Payne had always wanted to be a young dad, but says he struggled at first. \u201cI built it up so much in my head. Finding your feet in that relationship between child and father \u2013 it\u2019s difficult.\u201d He contributed by cooking. \u201cCheryl was always really glued to Bear, so for me, I was like: \u2018What\u2019s my role in this? If I cook and look after her, then in turn I\u2019m looking after him\u2019 \u2013 that made sense to me.\u201d The couple publicly confirmed their split in July 2018, but continue to co-parent. Lately Payne\u2019s schedule has taken him away for weeks at a time, which is \u201calways difficult\u201d, especially now Bear is old enough to notice. \u201cBut he\u2019s good at using the phone and FaceTime.\u201d That schedule is about to get busier, with Payne\u2019s debut album as a solo artist finally out this Friday. Laden with chart-friendly trop house, trap and Latin pop influences, LP 1 plays like a water cannon aimed at commercial radio \u2013 there is even a Christmas song. It has been a long lead-up: the first single, Strip That Down, was released nearly two years ago and established Payne as the 1D member most influenced by contemporary hip-hop \u2013 perhaps too much so. A picture he posted to Instagram of himself in February 2018 wearing a chain necklace, flipping the bird and bragging about travelling by private jet was quietly deleted following ridicule. Amid the success of Strip That Down, which was streamed over 1bn times, Payne was also still \u201cstruggling\u201d with alcohol: \u201cI just hid it very well.\u201d He went on to spend an entire year sober \u2013 a necessary if boring step. \u201cMy social life completely plummeted. I always feel like you never get past the awkward first 10 minutes at a party, when everyone\u2019s like: \u2018Do we get up and dance, or do we just sit here?\u2019 I don\u2019t know whether it made me happier, but it was definitely needed.\u201d His more recent stint of self-discipline was to prepare for his nude photo shoot with model Stella Maxwell for Hugo Boss. In the lead-up, he was in the gym between \u201cfive and eight times a week, sometimes twice a day\u201d and eating mostly chicken and vegetables \u2013 with no carbohydrates after 2pm and nothing at all after 8pm. For the last \u201cstripping\u201d phase, he ate nothing but porridge and white fish for a month. \u201cIt was horrible \u2013 but it definitely works.\u201d The shoot had been his idea, inspired by campaigns featuring David Beckham and Mark Wahlberg \u2013 Payne\u2019s role models, whose cross-disciplinary celebrity shapes his own career goals. Last year he auditioned in front of Steven Spielberg for a part in next year\u2019s West Side Story remake, and has been submitting audition tapes irregularly since. \u201cIt\u2019s just trying to manage the time in between being a dad, a boyfriend, singer, model and whatever.\u201d Between the trap beats, tighty-whities and tattoos is he attempting to put across a new, more grown-up image? \u201cOh yeah, definitely.\u201d In One Direction, he was \u201cMr Vanilla \u2013 no one wanted to know a thing\u201d. Then, with the \u201cchain and rapper phase \u2026 I didn\u2019t really know what I was aiming for, but it was actually exactly where we are right now. I just needed to find the right keys to make me feel like the man I wanted to be.\u201d Which is, he jokes, is \u201clike a really English Magic Mike\u201d. Do you like being objectified, I ask? \u201cI think it\u2019s quite funny,\u201d says Payne, clearly delighted. The other day, he says, someone sent him a picture of an old lady walking past an enormous blown-up poster of him in his pants. Not bad for Mr Vanilla, I say. \u201cExactly.\u201d Liam Payne\u2019s debut album LP1 is out on Friday 6 December. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 January 2020 to remove a reference to Liam Payne \u201cmaking the reserve list for the British Olympics team\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
