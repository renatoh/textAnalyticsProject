Writer Yashar Ali tweeted: \u201cI see that the unrepentant murderer just joined Twitter\u201d, referring to the one-time football star, who was accused of the 12 June 1994 killing of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. Simpson has always maintained his innocence. While the 71-year-old, who now lives in Las Vegas, was acquitted of the murder charges, Brown and Goldman\u2019s families sued him in civil court for wrongful death, winning a $33.5m judgment. The vast majority of this judgment has not been paid. Ali urged Twitter users to support Goldman\u2019s sister, who hosts a new podcast called \u201cConfronting: OJ Simpson.\u201d \u201cCan everyone do me a big favor? Please follow Ron Goldman\u2019s sister, @KimEGoldman She should have more followers than that monster Please RT,\u201d Ali wrote. Danny Deraney, a top Los Angeles publicist, slammed Simpson\u2019s new followers, who now total about 630,000. \u201cIf you followed OJ Simpson on Twitter, I think you should be obligated to tell Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown\u2019s families and tell them why you did so. In fact do that with all murdered victims families if you choose to follow a murderer on Twitter,\u201d Deraney tweeted. Prominent figures in the entertainment world also criticized Simpson\u2019s Twitter debut, including the Emmy-nominated comedian Billy Eichner. He asked Simpson\u2019s new followers, \u201cSeriously, what the f--k is wrong with you?\u201d Randi Mayem Singer, who wrote the screenplay for Mrs. Doubtfire, also questioned Simpson\u2019s followers, writing on Twitter, \u201cWhy? Why would you do that? Please explain to me.\u201d Comedienne Chelsea Handler\u2019s sardonic response \u2013 \u201cLet\u2019s all take a moment to be happy OJ Simpson joined Twitter and not Trump\u2019s cabinet. It\u2019s the little things these days\u201d \u2013 prompted a reply from Goldman\u2019s sister. \u201cI could think of a hundred million other things to be happy about than a double murderer joining anything \u2026 but I get your point,\u201d Goldman wrote. In a video posted to Simpson\u2019s Twitter page \u2013 which was not verified by the social media company but was reportedly confirmed to be authentic by Simpson himself \u2013 he says he has a \u201clittle gettin\u2019 even to do\u201d. He also claimed that his Twitter account would be used to \u201cset the record straight\u201d. Simpson was released from prison in October 2017 after being arrested in 2007 over a botched Las Vegas robbery. He was found guilty the next year. Another disgraced public figure also prompted outrage on Twitter over the weekend in the shape of Bill Cosby, who is now imprisoned in Pennsylvania for sexual assault. A tweet from his verified account, as well as an Instagram account, referred to Cosby as \u201cAmerica\u2019s dad\u201d. \u201cI know it\u2019s late, but to all of the Dads \u2026 It\u2019s an honor to be called a Father, so let\u2019s make today a renewed oath to fulfilling our purpose \u2013 strengthening our families and communities,\u201d said the much-derided post. Cosby\u2019s spokesman told USA Today that the disgraced star had asked that a Father\u2019s Day message from him be posted and that it was aimed at soon-to-be released prisoners."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
