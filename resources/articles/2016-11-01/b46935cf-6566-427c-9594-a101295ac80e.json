England had won convincingly and, though it may need a few more results of this nature before they are forgiven for the ordeal of Euro 2016, there was at least the sense of a team moving forward, with a little more optimism than before. Wembley, once again, felt like a happy place. To say England had excelled would be an exaggeration but the reality is they did not have to play above themselves when their opponents were guilty of defending this obligingly. England could have passed the ball with more authority at times and Southgate is surely too perceptive to think the team\u2019s shortcomings have been removed on the basis of one evening\u2019s work. Equally it is difficult to be too critical after they have won by this margin and, if nothing else, it was certainly an improvement on the 2-0 home win against Malta and the 0-0 draw in Slovenia. However much Southgate tried to avoid talking about his own position, it is almost inconceivable the FA will look elsewhere to fill the role vacated by Sam Allardyce. The paradox is that it was also a night when Gordon Strachan could reflect that Scotland had maybe deserved more without it sounding like the usual protestations of a manager whose job is in extreme peril. Scotland matched their opponents for long spells and, if this proves to be the final game of Strachan\u2019s tenure, he will always remember the opportunities for James Forrest and Robert Snodgrass at 1-0 to put in the equalising goal that would have provided a test of England\u2019s nerve. Forrest aimed his shot wide before Snodgrass\u2019s effort was blocked by John Stones and, from a Scottish perspective, these were the moments that served as a reminder about how cruel football can sometimes be. It was England\u2019s next attack that culminated in Adam Lallana heading the goal that made it 2-0 and, though Scotland played with tactical discipline, togetherness and old-fashioned grit, they simply did not have the refinement in attack to come back from that position. Strachan\u2019s men were quick to the ball, strong in the tackle and played with a competitive spirit that made them awkward opponents for a team with England\u2019s fragility. Ultimately, though, this was a Scotland team with three-quarters of their defence made up of players from the second tier of English football and Lallana\u2019s goal was not the only time the visitors were vulnerable to crosses. All of the goals came from headers and, as Strachan acknowledged, the first one from Daniel Sturridge highlighted the imbalance of talent between the sides. Kyle Walker\u2019s cross was at an awkward height but Sturridge improvised brilliantly to direct a stooping, instinctive header past Craig Gordon. Gary Cahill\u2019s was a more orthodox header, direct from Wayne Rooney\u2019s corner, but England may have to take better care of the ball if they are to trouble Spain in Tuesday\u2019s friendly. They looked disjointed in the opening stages and it was only the last quarter of an hour, with the game to all intents decided, that they could relax against demoralised opponents. In other parts of the match it was an error-strewn performance. John Stones, in particular, had a difficult first 45 minutes but there were also times when Rooney and Lallana endangered their team with moments of carelessness inside their own half. Scott Brown played as though utterly determined to justify his selection on his one-off night out of international retirement. Darren Fletcher, his partner in central midfield, was just as combative and, to give Strachan his due, Scotland could be forgiven for thinking the general flow of the match was not reflected by the fact England were two goals ahead five minutes into the second half. Scotland\u2019s night became an exercise in damage limitation after Cahill\u2019s goal and an already distressing match for the team in garish pink and black \u2013 an away strip that should be put in a skip and never seen again \u2013 might have become even more of an ordeal had Raheem Sterling not been guilty of an extraordinary open-goal miss. He can otherwise look back on a satisfying night\u2019s work, having been given the licence to interchange positions with Rooney, Lallana and Sturridge. Stones had a better second half and Southgate clearly wants Walker and Danny Rose to operate in a similar way to how Tottenham use them. Rose got away with a scything challenge on Snodgrass that merited, at the very least, a yellow card and it was a pity to see England\u2019s left-back trying, unsuccessfully, to exaggerate a brushed contact from the same player in an attempt to win the flakiest of penalties. On a more positive note, it was Rose\u2019s left-wing cross for Lallana\u2019s goal. Walker had set up Sturridge and the two full-backs were always eager to press forward. Lallana has answered the questions, post Euro 2016, about whether he can add goals to his international portfolio and Sturridge must feel he justified his selection ahead of Harry Kane. Southgate\u2019s jubilation on the touchline demonstrated how much the victory meant to him and he will be inheriting a side who have not lost a qualifying match since 2009, a run stretching back 33 games. That record can feel like a deception sometimes but there was the unmistakable air here of a team showing the first real signs of recovery and it would be a surprise if the FA waits too long before finalising Southgate\u2019s new role."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
