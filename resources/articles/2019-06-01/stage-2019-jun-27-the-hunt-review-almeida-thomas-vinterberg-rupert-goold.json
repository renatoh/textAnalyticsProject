Now the theatre turns to another film from the same Danish director, Thomas Vinterberg, which also deals with sexual abuse. The main difference is that the accusation against Lucas, a teacher at an infant school, is in this case unjust. While David Farr\u2019s adaptation and Rupert Goold\u2019s production make rigorous viewing, I miss the sense of quotidian reality that gave the movie much of its power. In the film we see the vindictive isolation of Lucas after the six-year-old Clara falsely claims that he had exposed himself to her: even the local shopkeeper refuses to serve him food. The stage version feels more like a savage ritual. Great stress is laid on the drunken clannishness of the local men and Es Devlin\u2019s design is dominated by a rotating house through whose transparent walls we frequently glimpse an antlered deer. The point is clear: this is a hunting community and Lucas has become the prey. Farr also spells out more explicitly than in the film the guilt of Clara\u2019s parents, whose abrasive quarrels compel her to seek comfort from her teacher. It is all staged with skilful economy by Goold. At one point the house becomes a church teeming with Christmas worshippers. Tobias Menzies, with his taut features, admirably conveys the element of reserve in Lucas that both attracts the equally withdrawn Clara and makes him a natural target for the town\u2019s bully boys. Justin Salinger and Poppy Miller as the girl\u2019s parents vividly portray a couple torn between their long-term attachment to Lucas and refusal to believe their daughter is lying. Taya Tower \u2013 one of three children alternating as Clara \u2013 has an extraordinary rapt solemnity and Stuart Campbell impresses as Lucas\u2019s loyal son. In its depiction of the way a false accusation can spread like a virus, the play is undeniably chilling. But although Farr\u2019s script is subtly different from the original screenplay by Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm, I still feel this is a piece that works best through the detailed literalness of cinema. The Hunt is at the Almeida theatre, London, until 3 August"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
