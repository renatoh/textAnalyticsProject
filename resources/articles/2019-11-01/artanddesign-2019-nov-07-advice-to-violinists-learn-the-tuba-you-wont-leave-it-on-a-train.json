Luckily we have a whole raft of splendid galleries and museums here already. Fiona Collins Carrog, Denbighshire \u2022 What on earth is the RMT union thinking of by calling a rail strike during a general election (Report, 6 November). Do they want to give a boost to the union-bashing Tories? Roy Appleyard Herne Bay, Kent \u2022 Re Cherry Weston\u2019s letter (7 November), as the constituency of Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney has been a Labour stronghold since 1983, whether the woman in Merthyr casts her vote according to the elemental composition of Boris Johnson\u2019s testicles is highly unlikely to make a vas deferens. Adrian Brodkin London \u2022 At least people recognise violins (Letters, 7 November). When I asked at the lost property office at Lancaster bus station about my instrument they couldn\u2019t find it. Weeks later they got in touch, to say that a snooker cue case they\u2019d found actually had my flute inside. Matthew Newman Leeds \u2022 Just a thought for all those violinists and viola players who are prone to leaving their instruments on trains: learn the tuba instead. You\u2019ll never leave a tuba on a train. From experience I can tell you that it\u2019s difficult to forget, no matter how long a time you\u2019ve spent in the pub.
