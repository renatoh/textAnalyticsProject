Railtrack could only have survived if it had received huge government handouts to which it had no right, Jonathan Sumption QC for the Department for Transport said. \"A company whose financial situation is such that it can only meet its existing obligations if it receives very large sums to which it is not entitled is bust,\" he said. In Britain's biggest class action, shareholders are seeking \u00a3160m in compensation accusing Mr Byers of \"misfeasance in public office\", and breaches of their human rights. The claims are denied by the Department for Transport with Mr Byers arguing that he only decided on administration two days before taking action. Mr Sumption said the case rested on three issues, that Mr Byers: had misused legislation to avoid paying shareholders compensation for what was in effect renationalisation; had made Railtrack insolvent when it would not otherwise have been; and that he did this with the specific objective of harming the shareholders. \"The proposition that the damage done to shareholders by the administration order was seen as an advantage is perfectly absurd.\" The problem for the shareholders was that Railtrack was \"worthless\" but the extent of its problems \"had not yet been appreciated by the market\". The only thing Mr Byers had done that had contributed to Railtrack's going into administration was to refuse the company \"financial assistance to which it had no right\". Mr Sumption said counsel for the claimants Keith Rowley QC had said earlier in the hearing that the sins of Railtrack should not be visited on the shareholders. \"There is every reason the sins of Railtrack should be visited on the claimants. The prime risk any investor takes in buying shares is that the management of the company will mismanage it.\" Former Railtrack chairman John Robinson is to give evidence today. Letters disclosed yesterday show he did not oppose the government's seeking a petition putting the company into administration. His financial director said it was a \"no brainer\" that his company would have to go into administration if the government did not offer extra funds. The disclosures are likely to be used by lawyers seeking to prove Mr Byers had not acted with malice by putting the company into administration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
