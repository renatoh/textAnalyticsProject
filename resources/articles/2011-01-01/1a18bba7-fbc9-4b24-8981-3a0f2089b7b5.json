The actual cricket that will be played will be of little consequence, even though a win for Australia would see them take an unbeatable 4-1 lead in the seven-match series. This will be the day that the game will recognise a greater need and make a dedication to the victims of the recent flood disasters that have devastated Australia and, in particular, swathes of Queensland. This city was badly hit and though it is possible to journey through many areas of it without seeing anything amiss, the swollen and dirt-brown Brisbane river is an ugly reminder of the tragedy. There is still a torpor about the city and the largely deserted bars and restaurants have ached with listlessness in the past fortnight. \"We're a tired town, emotionally drained after all that's gone on,\" a member of the Gabba ground staff said as he prepared for a match that will raise more money for the flood appeal. \"We're a city of two million people and only 200,000 were affected by the floods. But the whole city got involved \u2013 some of them waist-deep in water to help as much as they could.\" Stephen Gray, the media manager at Queensland Cricket, said: \"I'm old enough to remember the Queensland floods of 1974 but this has caused more damage because so much more housing and infrastructure has been built up since then. After cyclone Larry, which hit north Queensland a few years ago, and the bush fires around Melbourne we've had it tough lately . \"I've felt these floods personally because I lived in Rockhampton and still have family in Ipswich. So far, Cricket Australia and all cricket in Australia, has raised about $A3.5m [over \u00a32m] for this appeal. We've had a $A100,000 donated by the Commonwealth Bank while Qantas are making another donation, based on runs scored and wickets taken in the match, which will raise a few hundred thousand more. In addition, every spectator will be paying $5 towards the fund, so if we get a crowd of 35,000 that's $A175,000. And the police and the public transport people have also waived their usual charges to us for this match.\" Yesterday the Australia players visited Goodna, west of Brisbane, and witnessed some of the devastation, though Shane Watson had already returned to his home town of Ipswich. The all-rounder said: \"It's going to be a very emotional day at The Gabba and hopefully that can help pull us over the line and win the series. This is something that took my mind off the cricket. After the disappointment of the Ashes series it put my life into perspective, for sure. It's just great I was able to score runs during that period but life is bigger and greater than cricket, even though I love playing it.\" The England players had already made donations to the appeal and yesterday they gave 30 tickets to the sports minister, Phil Reeves, to pass on to some of those hit by the disaster. Chris Tremlett was among the England players who watched and were appalled by the images of the flood on TV earlier this month. The fast bowler said: \"I imagine it will be quite emotional [on Sunday]. It was pretty shocking what happened here, but it seems quite surreal now because walking around it's almost as if it never happened. The Aussie cricketers seem to have friends and family who have been affected. We have tried to help out and hopefully it will be a great day and people will get a lot out of it. \"Most of the guys watched what happened on the news. I didn't like to watch too much because it gets me a bit emotional and upset watching those things. Things seem to have got back to normality here even though there's still a big clean up job to do and hopefully we can play some sort of part in their recovery.\" The Queensland favourite Martin Love had the first floor of his Fairfield home submerged, while the family home of the young fast bowler Scott Walker, in West End, was destroyed. \"Scotty's home was inundated, completely gone,\" Gray said. \"We were helping out there but it wasn't about cleaning up so much. We were actually gutting the house. \"We had tradies there pulling out walls and taking out the kitchen. They left the place a shell and they'll have to decide now whether to renovate or rebuild.\" There will be some people in England sitting up in bed and scoring the match.. But even they will recognise that this is about something more than a mere game of cricket."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
