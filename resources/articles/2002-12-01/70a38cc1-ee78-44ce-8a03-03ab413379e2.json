The judges said they had chosen Freedland for his \"incisive, original, strong, very outspoken views\". \"He can go from very sophisticated to very straightforward. He takes no one else's line other than his own,\" they added. Freedland has been praised for switching between the different styles of the Daily Mirror and the Guardian with ease and has commented from the pages of both on every major issue of the past 12 months. He is employed by the Guardian but also writes for the Daily Mirror as part of editor Morgan's attempts to follow a more serious news agenda. Recently in the Daily Mirror he compared the performance of Cherie Blair in the wake of the Peter Foster scandal to Hillary Clinton's as Bill Clinton's presidency reached crisis point. \"Both have big dreams. Cherie hopes to become one of Britain's most senior judges. Hillary is a US senator but is hotly tipped to be the Democrat candidate for president in 2008. Like their husbands, these are women who should never be underestimated,\" he wrote. Earlier in the year, writing in the Guardian, Freedland correctly predicted the resignation of Stephen Byers. \"So Stephen Byers will surely not survive for long. And when he goes his passing will mark a milestone in the journey of New Labour. For it will send the message that robotic loyalty and technocratic blandness can only carry you so far,\" he wrote. \"True success in politics requires ideas, passion and the ability to stir the public heart. Stephen Byers has none of those qualities. The tougher question is: does New Labour?\" Freedland, who is policy editor of the Guardian, also made a key contribution to the newspaper's Big Brother series on privacy issues. \"Whichever moment is the stand-out one for you, a common motif emerges: the death of privacy. In 21st century Britain, it seems, privacy is heading the way of chivalry or deference into the dustbin of discarded values. It's under assault from all sides - whether an intrusive press, prying big-business or a nosey government,\" he wrote in September. He also turned his hand to less weighty matters, examining the reasons behind the success of The Office, the big comedy hit of the year. \"The public have always cut Richard Branson more slack than most industry tycoons because of the hippy hair and beard, somehow assuming a kinder, gentler approach to business comes with the haircut. \"Even Tony Blair can still play the man-in-jeans card to seem less like a remote, authority figure. As The Office makes clear, that's all a bit of a con,\" he wrote in the Guardian. Speaking as he received the award, Freedland added that he got much more response from his pieces for the Guardian - but said was probably because his email address was printed at the end of his column."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
