But DNA data is not the only information police hold on people who are not convicted. The police routinely undertake surveillance of the public going about their lawful business and engaged in political activity. Photographs, names and other information - sometimes obtained through subterfuge - are held in police databases. I am awaiting a judicial review of police activity relating to invasive and intrusive surveillance when I and others attended the annual general meeting of Reed Elsevier in spring 2005. The company organises arms fairs, including one held in London last week. My legal action, brought with the assistance of Liberty, alleges that the surveillance I describe contravenes the European convention on human rights. Unfortunately similar legal action to this, in relation the the retention of DNA data, has not been successful. Nevertheless legal aid has been awarded to bring my legal action, now expected in February 2008, two years and four months from the date the action started.
