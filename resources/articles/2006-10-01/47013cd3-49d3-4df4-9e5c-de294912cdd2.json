The GDR's state film company, the Deutsche Film Aktien Gesellschaft (Defa) made films mostly with a heavy political slant, and produced hardly any directors of note. Among the few who did emerge was Frank Beyer, who has died aged 74 and whose career was blighted by censorship. After directing half a dozen well-received films, he made Traces of Stone (Spur der Steine, 1966), which the ruling communists, the Socialist Unity party (SED), promptly banned, labelling it \"hostile to the party and the state\". The decision resulted in Beyer's ousting from the SED, banishment from the studios and his being prevented from working in Berlin and Potsdam. Because Defa was the only organisa- tion in the GDR where one could make films, Beyer was forced to find work in Dresden as a director at the state theatre, and for television. It was nine years before he was able to make another feature, Jacob the Liar (Jakob der L\u00fcgner, 1975), the first and only East German film to be nominated for a foreign film Oscar. Audiences were able to see what the fuss had been about only when Traces of Stone was released in 1989, after the fall of the Berlin wall and the collapse of the GDR. The film tells of a married party secretary who has fallen into disgrace after getting a young women pregnant. At the same time, the cynical foreman of a building crew, who expresses some doubts as to the ruling party's role in the workplace, is in love with the same woman. The film, which offered no more than minor criticism of the Stalinist state, is a well-balanced mixture of comedy, drama and social satire, with an oblique metaphor of the GDR as a chaotic construction site. Beyer, who was born in the central German town of Nobitz, studied theatre sciences and then film direction, from 1952 to 1957, at Famu, the celebrated film school in Prague. His first feature, Two Mothers (1957), dealt with a theme that would reappear throughout his life's work: coming to terms with the Nazi period, a subject that was in tune with the anti-fascism of the majority of films produced by Defa. Five Cartridges (1960) took the Spanish civil war as a background, and the influence of the new Czechoslovak and Polish cinemas was in evidence in the war film K\u00f6nigskinder (1962). Also made during this brief period of relative artistic freedom before the 1965 crackdown was Carbide and Sorrel (Karbid und Sauerampfer, 1963), a light-hearted road movie in which the hero makes his way home across the war-torn countryside where food is scarce and the Red army everywhere. Naked Among Wolves (Nackt unter W\u00f6lfen, 1963), written by former Buchenwald inmate Bruno Apitz, was Beyer's first film to be shown widely abroad - and the first German film to deal with the issue of concentration camps. In restrospect, it is clear that both Steven Spielberg (Schindler's List, 1993) and Roberto Benigni (Life is Beautiful, 1997) had seen Beyer's movie, which, based on a true story, tells of how Polish prisoners at Buchenwald hide a four-year-old Jewish boy who has been born in Auschwitz and smuggled into their camp inside a large suitcase. Beyer had originally planned to start shooting Jacob the Liar in the autumn of 1966, but because of the political chill it was not completed until 1974. It broke the traditions of the anti-fascist genre by treating the story of Jews in a Polish ghetto in 1943 as a fable which questioned the value of truth in hopeless situations. The poignant and comic film involves Jacob Heym, played by the Czech actor Vlastimil Brodsky (who won the best actor Silver Bear award at the 1975 Berlin film festival) as an elderly Jew who raises people's spirits by pretending to have a radio and passing on imaginary reports of good news from the front. The film was remade egregiously by Hollywood in 1999 with Robin Williams. Of Beyer's four other feature films, The Turning Point (Der Aftenthalt, 1983), about a teenage German soldier at the end of the war wrongly accused of shooting a Polish woman, stands out. After the collapse of the Berlin wall, Beyer made Nikolaikirche (1995), a television film about the mass demonstrations in Leipzig that led to the downfall of the communist system in East Germany, in which he captures the dangers and the euphoria of the time with remarkable accuracy. In 1991, praised as a cultural \"bridgebuilder between the federal republic and GDR long before reunification\", Beyer was awarded the German film prize for his life's work. He was divorced from the actor Renate Blum, and is survived by his partner Karin Kiwus. \u00b7 Frank Beyer, film director, born May 26 1932; died October 1 2006."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
