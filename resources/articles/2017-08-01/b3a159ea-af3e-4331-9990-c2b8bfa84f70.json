There are many reasons, not least its excellent showing in a recent student satisfaction survey: 36th out of 129 in the UK. There is the added attraction of Brett Warburton, of bakery and 16th in the North West Rich List fame, as the university\u2019s first pro-chancellor \u2013 a \u201csenior dignitary and ambassador for the university\u201d. Above all, perhaps, the university can boast a truly eyecatching vice-chancellor. Introducing Professor George Holmes, Bentley driver, yacht owner and now leading voice in the battle for fair vice-chancellor remuneration. Holmes finds himself, the Financial Times revealed last week, profoundly narked by renewed suggestions, notably on the part of Lord Adonis and the education secretary, Jo Johnson, that some of the country\u2019s vice-chancellors \u2013 average salary almost \u00a3280,000 \u2013 might not merit pay rises that continue to elude most senior public sector workers, including university colleagues in teaching and research. On the contrary: the vice-chancellors\u2019 high salaries, along with the conspicuous consumption thereby brought within reach, are themselves, argues Holmes, inspirational to Bolton\u2019s prospective students. Although any adequately showy Veblen good \u2013 one whose inflated price only makes it more desirable, named after the Norwegian-American economist \u2013 would presumably do the trick, his own taste is for things that go over, say, high-end jewellery or leather goods. Any applicants discouraged, in Bolton\u2019s case, by its overall league table position (125th out of 129), are advised to set that against the vice-chancellor\u2019s enormous Bentley. \u201cI have had a very successful career,\u201d Holmes told the FT. (He is the former principal of Doncaster College). \u201cI hope students use their education to get a good job and then they can have a Bentley. Do you want to be taught by someone who is successful or a failure?\u201d Although often debated, the case for university education as, primarily, a means to an end \u2013 that of wealth-generation \u2013 can rarely have been so forcefully put. Here, in a nutshell, is the response to, among others, Thorstein Veblen, who, in The Higher Learning in America, published in 1918, attacked what he considered to be the corruption of academe by the values of the market. His original subtitle was A Study in Total Depravity. A century of like-minded protests has, of course, failed to halt the reimagining of universities as competitor businesses in which the discerning consumer might reasonably expect proof, from any vice-chancellor wanting to be taken seriously, of achievements in luxury car/yacht/handbag acquisition that would enable them to pass in How to Spend It circles. If there is any flaw in Holmes\u2019s argument, it is that even the least attentive applicants may notice that he himself is, accessories aside, among the country\u2019s less successful vice-chancellors \u2013 55 of them earn more than \u00a3300,000. Forget other measures; decided purely on the basis of Holmes\u2019s recorded wealth, who, other than Warburton bread lovers, would apply to Bolton? Do you want to be taught, to recall Holmes\u2019s own question, by someone who is, in material terms, successful or a failure? On that basis, our leading university is, unquestionably, Bath, where, as Adonis has been complaining in parliament, Glynis Breakwell earns \u2013 following an 11% rise \u2013 \u00a3451,000 a year. Impressively, she also enjoys use of a Georgian flat and full-time housekeeper. In another stand-out success story \u2013 before his rivals\u2019 first-class air tickets and hotel bills, relocation loans and chauffeured cars are taken into account \u2013 Southampton\u2019s vice-chancellor, Sir Christopher Snowden, earns an annual \u00a3352,000, notwithstanding the university\u2019s bronze (ie, lowest) rating for teaching standards. At the University of East London (bronze) John Joughin\u2019s 13.5% rise presumably reflects a terror on the part of the university\u2019s remuneration committee that irreplaceable talent might be poached by a rival institution. The University of Buckingham\u2019s Len Shackleton, an economics professor, has pointed out in the Times Higher Education that vice-chancellors could earn way more in Australia. Another professorial apercu on their pay: it\u2019s \u201ctiny\u201d compared with Gary Lineker\u2019s. Given his failure to earn more, perhaps Bolton\u2019s vice-chancellor is wise to emphasise, for prospective undergraduates, the further higher education asset of a Bentley, a brand with which Bolton is ever more closely associated. In advertising his vehicle, he immediately signals, to ambitious students, his membership of an elite that includes fellow Bentley owners Kim Kardashian, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Paris Hilton, Philip Green and Jennifer Lopez, not forgetting the late MP and Nazi sympathiser Alan Clark. To return to Back Fire, Clark\u2019s collected car writings, is to realise what an ornament Clark, who also loved to pose with his Bentleys, might have been to a university such as Bolton. \u201cI drive my Continental for therapy,\u201d he writes, \u201cand still have no trouble with salesmen in Vauxhalls on the motorway.\u201d If the attractions of Bentleys are nowadays less compelling to students with any interest in clean air or personal dignity, vice-chancellor Holmes is by no means alone, as the mayor of Dover, Neil Rix, has recently demonstrated, in his conviction, regardless of exhortations to curb car use, that swank cars naturally inspire awe. Rix, not long ago photographed sniffing a powdery substance off a cistern in a lavatory cubicle, complains that his high status in Dover has been inadequately served by a Toyota Prius. Due to various size issues, he and his chauffeur reportedly find it uncomfortable. I would offer the mayor, for a reasonable price, my spacious Citro\u00ebn Berlingo, with full service record and new MOT, had he not been clear that \u201cthe make of vehicle should reflect the prestige and status of the mayoralty\u201d. No Berlingo deserves that. But in what is possibly the most disquieting aspect of this episode, Dover councillors effectively endorsed, by voting Rix a luxury upgrade, as opposed to a comfy van or bus, Gatsbyish delusions that can only contribute to public indifference to warnings about emissions and lung disease. Few drivers, after all, are likely to think themselves less deserving of a prestigious vehicle, widely available thanks to today\u2019s insane leasing arrangements, than is councillor Rix. An infatuation with status symbols may be natural, in the vice-chancellor community, among individuals who have come to believe their own salaries confer reputational advantages. But on local councils public servants have reason and opportunity, as official cars come up for renewal, to establish green vehicles, not motorised bling, as the high-status choice. True, such restraint, if it catches on, has its price. What will motivate our young people, supposing we accept the Holmes analysis, if they do not see how good jobs translate into high-end vehicle choices? How else will leaders like him advertise their very successful careers? There can be only one possible compensation for this loss: more money."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
