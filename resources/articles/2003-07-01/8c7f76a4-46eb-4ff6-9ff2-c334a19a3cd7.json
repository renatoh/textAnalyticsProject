Gardai believe the schools are used to get the women legal permits to study in Ireland but they are then sent to work as lap dancers and prostitutes across the state. A senior officer confirmed this weekend that the three schools came under scrutiny after Operation Quest, which resulted in gardai raids on lap-dancing clubs. More than 100 women from Eastern Europe are being held in custody following the raids. 'We discovered that the directors of some of the clubs we raided happened to also be directors of the three schools. And then we found that some of the girls working at the clubs were registered as students at the language schools,' the garda officer told The Observer. He said the women were trafficked into Ireland by Mafia-type gangs based in Estonia and Latvia. 'It is a very clever ruse involving Irish people and the Eastern European Mafia. The girls come in totally legally as students but learn little English. They spend most of their time working the clubs or the brothels in other parts of Ireland. Once the women get into Ireland on these permits we have found they simply disappear. The girls might be here on legal work permits but they are being exploited.' Ireland has just passed a law making it illegal for employers to hire undocumented foreign workers. The gardai will use the legislation to pursue their first prosecutions after Operation Quest. Ten premises were searched and 101 people, including five men, were arrested. More than \u20ac100,000 as well as small quantities of cocaine and cannabis were seized in the raids involving several units, including the National Immigration Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the fraud and drugs divisions. The CAB has frozen the assets of several lap-dance club directors. Assistant Garda Commissioner Kevin Carty led the operation. The Chinese Triads pioneered the use of language schools to gain access to work permits in Ireland. Last year The Observer revealed that the Triads were using these private schools to smuggle hundreds of Chinese workers into the Republic. Most who gained permits were sent to work in catering and learnt little English in the schools."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
