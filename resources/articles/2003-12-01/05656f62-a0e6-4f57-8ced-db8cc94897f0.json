Most of the remaining computers required software, which was still on its way from London, and I need equipment from Kampala to fix the remainder. Being on a budget, I am reluctant to pay the $130 return airfare from Arua, and so must look for a lift with someone driving down. So I spent a week designing the university a basic website. While it is easy enough to register a web domain in Uganda - even the academic .ac.ug domains seem unrestricted - finding an ISP to host it is another matter. In England there are numerous companies offering joint registration and hosting, but in Uganda? If someone reading this knows of any, please do get in touch. I also spent some more time looking around Ombaci. Unfortunately I went, there on Eid, which is a religious public holiday in Uganda. Of course, it was only declared a public holiday once the moon had been sighted from Mombasa, and I knew nothing of it until I arrived at the campus to find few students, and no lecturers. The individuals I did talk to seemed happy with their progress as pioneers, though there is a shortage of space in the accommodation block. And more worryingly, there is still no power. We walked over to the unused government-owned satellite dishes and transmitter mast that back on to the campus. Beyond it, 60 hectares of spare land stretched down the valley. If there was the political will, and the funding, we could easily build a campus for 2,000 students here, including a farm for the agriculture experts to play on, and forget about the proposed site at Uriama. If there was the will. We went on to Wandi, another new site option 5km further north from Ombaci. The compound there, comprising many buildings and some farmland, is owned by the West Nile Cooperative Tobacco Union. It currently has three tenants, all tobacco companies, but there are at least five unused blocks, which they are willing to give to Nile University. The only catch is we will have to renovate them, which will cost about $10,000. It is easy to see why they want the university there. Decades of growing and curing tobacco have left trees in short supply in the region: The farmers are looking to diversify before the last trunk comes crashing down. Nile University's agriculture professors could provide the expertise necessary to do this, perhaps on a consultancy basis, which would benefit both sides. The farmers could even use our computers and internet connection to check crop recommendations and weather forecasts. Which brings me to Wandi's massive selling point - it has a 65kVA diesel generator, again unused, but ready to roar. That's enough power for 30 computers, a water pump and lighting - and we would still have spare watts to keep a few beers cold. The site is also on the main power line from Arua, so it gets four hours of electricity every other evening. Presumably this will become permanent power when such a thing comes to West Nile, though as I have previously indicated I suspect the second coming will pre-empt it. Responsibility for the region's power has shifted from the state-controlled Ugandan Electricity Board to a private West Nile company - apparently a cowboy shell outfit set up specifically to win the contract, with no experience of running power distribution grids, or much else. On the powered-up evenings the lights dim and flicker every half hour, and frequently give up entirely before the official 11pm cut off. It's hard to be sympathetic with the authorities, knowing Uganda is a net electricity exporter, selling power to Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania. But northern Uganda is a forgotten region, far away from the politicians in Kampala, and easy to sell off in the name of privatisation and progress. Back in town there has been more bad news. Following a series of at times heated discussions it has become obvious that there will be no permanent power until February, and no large generator before I leave for Christmas, which means no IT network - in fact no more than one PC operating at a time. Shortly after resigning myself to this fact I was hit by another bad omen - the internet caf\u00e9 I had been using unexpectedly closed down, as it is running at a consistent loss. But optimism and hope abound in Uganda, probably the only contagious conditions it helps to catch. When power arrives the university may have access to a large room in Arua town, which will probably be much easier and cheaper to connect to the internet than Ombaci or Wandi. I have suggested that half the computers go on a network in Arua, while the rest can be used for teaching IT skills at whichever campus becomes Nile's permanent home. I also discovered that Arua has a second internet caf\u00e9, and at 80 Ugandan shillings a minute this one is 20% cheaper. I asked if there was a third, just in case they pack it in as well, but apparently not - so let's hope my daily usage keeps them in profit. Back in the office I found a dialup service that can be used on the university's Uganda Telecom phone line, so at least the administration can now check its email. A couple of days before returning to Kampala, having reluctantly realised I have no option but to fly, I was visiting some relatives of the family I stay with in Arua. One of the sons had just taken his A-levels, the academic year being somewhat different here, in maths, physics and chemistry. I asked him what he wants to do next year. He didn't hesitate in his reply: \"I want to learn IT. To succeed you must be computer literate, so I want to study IT at Nile University.\" For more information on Nile University, contact Ed Sexton, +256 78 301983, nile@existent.co.uk Father Adiga Nakari, +256 77 850623 (mobile), +256 47 620649 (landline), adiganakari@yahoo.com For more information on the East African Education Foundation (EAEF) and its involvement with the university, contact Stuart Sexton, +44 1883 626844, sexton@warlinghamparkschool.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
