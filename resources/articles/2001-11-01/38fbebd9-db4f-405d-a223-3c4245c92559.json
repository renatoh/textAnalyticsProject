In real life, male models have never caught the public imagination sufficiently to be branded super - would the celluloid version fare any differently? Apparently, yes. Zoolander, which opens here at the end of the month starring Ben Stiller as a male super, has been a surprise hit in America. Hollywood, it seems, has a soft spot for fashion, and the attraction seems to be reciprocated. American Vogue persuaded Stiller to join them in Paris this summer to give his verdict on the haute couture shows and try his hand at modelling for real. Glenda Bailey's new-look Harpers Bazaar, meanwhile, has hired some of Hollywood's most acclaimed directors to give box-office punch to its fashion shoots: Spike Lee takes a break from features to shoot Donna Karan coats and Ralph Lauren cashmere for the November issue, while a David Lynch shoot is also in the pipeline. The only potential hiccup in a marriage made in heaven? Serial cover girl Gwyneth Paltrow claims to have learned the hard way that fashion shoots can be as exploitative as the casting couch. Gwynnie claims to have been as surprised as we were to open the current issue of Bazaar and see her backside in all its glory: she says Patrick Demarchelier assured her the pictures would be more tastefully cropped, although he asked her to take her knickers off to avoid \"indentation\". Demarchelier, however, says Paltrow was quite happy to pose nude. Somebody, it seems, has had a memory lapse. But hey, neither fashion nor Hollywood are exactly slaves to the unvarnished truth. Probably why they get along so well, really."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
