There could be no queasily early Saturday kick-off and we did not even have a lonely Monday night match as the orphan of the fixture list. All 20 top-flight clubs assembled on Boxing Day with each of them reaching the halfway point in the league programme on a single afternoon. The Premiership was presenting itself for inspection. That competition has come in for some beady-eyed scepticism this year, with the gaze homing in on the mismatch between humdrum football and the most exalted ticket prices to be found anywhere in the world. Since the Premiership was the brainchild of free marketeers, the chairmen will suffer no twinge of conscience so long as the demand for seats stays high irrespective of the cost. It is still too early to tell whether the fans are really beginning to withhold their credit cards in protest. There are plenty of moments to make them doubt that they are in the presence of the elite. Even Newcastle United supporters, counting off the days to the transfer window on their secular version of an advent calendar, must have goggled anew at the delinquency of the back four when Paul Dickov scored with mocking ease for Blackburn on Sunday. Nonetheless wobbles of concentration and organisation are inherent to the culture and entertainment of harum-scarum, wholehearted English football. Rigour is barely tolerated, let alone savoured. There were no connoisseurs to befriend Jose Mourinho when he sensibly put the accent on defence while he and Chelsea got used to one another. Only coaching course devotees appreciate seeing back four and midfield interlock like chainmail. Football in this country will continue in its own scatty way and it is not necessarily heading in the wrong direction. Manchester United are the sole English winners of the European Cup since it was restructured as the Champions League but for the first time there are to be four English clubs in the knockout phase of the tournament. Three of them are competing for the Premiership title as well, since Manchester United are not to be discounted yet. Given an influx of cash to the transfer budget, Rafael Ben\u00edtez could well add Liverpool to the list of contenders in the next year or two, but even the current pluralism must be envied in Italy and Spain. This is one of the better periods in the Premiership's history, with stirrings of new life around the table. Everton have chastened people like me who thought them bound for relegation, Spurs are closing in on self-respect and Harry Redknapp developed Portsmouth to such an extent that they can prosper without him. The real boon, though, has been at the top. It took the appointment of Mourinho to make us realise how dependent the Premiership had been on the battle of wits and words between Sir Alex Ferguson and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who have wrangled for eight years. The Portuguese has barged in between them and, for the moment at least, strode past his rivals. Over the years to come it is theoretically possible that Roman Abramovich's wealth will bring Chelsea an unreasonable advantage but Ferguson has spent vast amounts since 1998 and Arsenal have invested well in youth. Mourinho himself is a more important asset than any single footballer that Abramovich has been able to afford. While good order has been maintained in defence, the goals have begun to flow at Stamford Bridge and they come from the sort of system, with one striker supported by deep-lying attackers, that others, such as United, have tried with mixed results. There is plenty of work ahead for Mourinho. He must be thinking of upgrading the squad with another centre-forward for next season and the composition of the midfield could alter. With a team of continental scrupulousness and British vim, though, he has already given the Premiership a fresh force and his rivals a headache."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
