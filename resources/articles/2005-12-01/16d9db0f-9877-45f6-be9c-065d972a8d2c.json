The first entry uses pictures to illustrate the rather unusual manner in which the White House Iraq strategy has evolved. These are, after all, photo opportunities that have included the \"Plan for Victory\" backdrop to yesterday's speech and the \"Mission Accomplished\" of more than two years earlier. The liberal side of the comment spectrum is, as you might have guessed, not so sure of the strategy. Fred Kaplan of Slate applauds the spelling out of specific stages of success where once there were ideals (\"spreading freedom\" is his example) but wonders if it has not all come a bit too late. It is symptomatic of everything that's gone wrong with this war that, after two and a half years of fighting it (and four years after starting to plan it), the White House is just now getting around to articulating a strategy for winning it. To put this in perspective: from December 1941 to August 1945, the US government mobilised an entire nation [...] and emerged from battle poised to shape the destiny of half the globe. By comparison, from September 2001 to December 2005, the US government has advanced to the point of describing a path to victory in a country the size of California. From Britain, the Financial Times reports on changing military tactics in Iraq. The whack-a-mole missions where insurgents are pursued from hotspot to hotspot is being replaced by a hold and build strategy to secure urban centres and gradually expand their influence. Planners call it the \"oil spot\", though this was not a phrase the president used when he gave his speech to naval cadets in Maryland. The New York Times is scathing of the suggestion that Mr Bush's big picture represents anything new. Its editorial, rather dismissively, headlines the plan \"We Win\" and says that what \"Americans wanted to hear was a genuine counterinsurgency plan\". It adds: \"Americans have been clamouring for believable goals in Iraq, but Mr Bush stuck to his notion of staying until total victory.\" In the cruellest dig, eagerly picked up by Daily Kos, it compares Mr Bush's ideas about the Iraqi army to Richard Nixon's Vietnamisation. Substitute the Iraqi constitutional process for the Paris peace talks, and Mr Bush's ideas about the Iraqi army are not much different from Nixon's plans - except Nixon admitted the war was going very badly (which was easier for him to do because he didn't start it), and he was very clear about the risks and huge sacrifices ahead. A president who seems less in touch with reality than Richard Nixon needs to get out more. Luckily for Mr Bush, others are more supportive. The ever dependable PowerLine blog describes the Maryland address as \"thematically similar to a number of other excellent speeches he has given over the past four years\" and argues that Mr Bush has \"articulated his policy vision more consistently and more eloquently than any president since Lincoln\". That is not too far from the New York Times' calling it a \"rehash of the same tired argument that everything's going just fine\", though clearly imbued with different sentiments. If you ever wanted to see how two people could have two completely different takes on the same event, here is your chance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
