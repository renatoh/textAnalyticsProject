But as he prepares to lead Leigh, his eighth club, into Saturday's Northern Ford Premiership grand final against Huddersfield, the 30-year-old father of four is beginning to feel the effects. He has been suffering regular blackouts for the past year. \"I took a serious bang to the head when we played Huddersfield two weeks ago trying to put a big hit into Rob Roberts but getting the timing all wrong,\" he said. \"I was out like a light. You can tell how bad it was, I got knocked out at 3.25pm and woke up at 8.45pm. And when I did, I was calling the doctor Shaun McRae and telling Keiron Cunningham to keep scooting from dummy-half,\" a reference to his St Helens heyday of 1995-96 when he lifted the Challenge Cup and the inaugural Super League title. \"My own doctor is a bit worried because I've been suffering blackouts quite regularly for the past 12 months. I'm going to get it checked out next week.\" But he says there is no question of him missing the final in his home town of Widnes. Whatever his detractors say, there has never been any question regarding toughness. But defeat would leave his career in the balance as the deal he has agreed with Leigh is conditional on them reaching the Super League. Goulding's move to Leigh, shortly after a training-ground clash with a Salford team-mate that earned him a two- week club suspension, has revitalised a season that was in danger of turning into a procession. Huddersfield, who were relegated from the Super League last autumn after finishing bottom for the third year running, had cruised through their fixture list with 26 wins and a draw. Leigh finished second - 10 points behind - and have already been heavily beaten twice by the Giants. \"We're rank outsiders,\" said Goulding. \"Huddersfield haven't lost all year and they are the best team in the competition. But that means there's no pressure on us. For the final we'll have Vila [Matautia] back and that will give us a lift. It's a one-off and anything can happen.\" Leigh share Goulding's unshakeable self-belief, even though at 30 his powers are on the wane - and there are those in the game who believe they have been for some time. His last Great Britain caps came in the home series against an Australia team drawn from the rebel Super League competition in 1997, and since then he has found himself surplus to requirements at St Helens, Huddersfield and Salford. Perhaps his reputation has counted against him on occasions. His tantrums have included being arrested in an Auckland restaurant when he was a teenage Great Britain tourist and an altercation with the Leeds coach Doug Laughton's car at a pre-season train ing camp in Anglesey. \"I should be in the Super League, no doubt about that,\" Goulding says. \"I know that for a fact because there aren't many good scrum-halves around.\" There were flashes of the teenage Goulding, arguably the most exciting British half-back prospect since Andy Gregory, in Sunday's win against Batley. With his sleeves rolled up above his muscular biceps he ran combatively at the defensive line, laid on Leigh's second try with a perfectly timed pass, and celebrated with the supporters as if he was back at Wembley. For the moment, though, he is looking forward, not back, as he contemplates what he hopes will be an Indian summer playing in the Super League. \"How funny it would be if we win on Saturday and I end up playing in the Super League with Leigh next season when Salford, who let me go, are in the NFP,\" he added with a grin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
