Shorten addressed the ACL\u2019s national conference in Canberra on Saturday morning. The assistant immigration minister, Michaelia Cash, was also billed to speak. In the speech, Shorten warned against using religion as an \u201cinstrument for division or exclusion\u201d. In comments apparently directed at the Liberal backbencher Cory Bernardi, Shorten writes, \u201cWhen I see people hiding behind the Bible to insult and demonise people based on their sexuality, I cannot stay silent. I do not agree. When I hear people allege that \u2018God tells them\u2019 that marriage equality is the first step on the road to polygamy and bigamy and bestiality, I cannot stay silent. I do not agree.\u201d Bernardi was forced to resign from the shadow ministry in 2012 after comments linking gay marriage and bestiality. Bernardi told the Senate at the time that allowing same-sex unions would be a slippery slope that could eventually lead to bestiality. \u201cThere are even some creepy people out there \u2026 who say it is OK to have consensual sexual relations between humans and animals,\u201d he said. He resigned amid mounting criticism from fellow Coalition MPs, citing the good of the party as the main reason for vacating the position. Momentum is building in the current parliament for gay marriage. Crossbench senator David Leyonhjelm is among the MPs calling on the prime minister, Tony Abbott, to allow a conscience vote so Coalition MPs can vote freely on same-sex unions. He shelved his plans to introduce a private member\u2019s bill on gay marriage earlier this month, saying the issue would be overshadowed in the current political climate. Leyonhjelm plans to reintroduce the bill at a later stage. The ACL has staunchly railed against gay marriage. It\u2019s deputy chairman, Jim Wallace, has described a \u201chomosexual lifestyle\u201d as being as harmful as smoking. Those comments prompted the then prime minister Julia Gillard to pull out of a scheduled appearance at that year\u2019s ACL national conference. Same-sex marriage advocates have criticised Shorten for attending the conference, saying it gives ACL legitimacy. The conference\u2019s venue, the Hyatt Hotel in Canberra, has similarly drawn fire online and on social media for hosting the gathering. Shorten will also use his address to back \u201cnon-traditional\u201d families. \u201cWhen I hear people invoking the scriptures to attack blended families, I cannot stay silent. I do not agree,\u201d Shorten writes. It\u2019s another barb levelled at Bernardi, who earlier this year released a book, The Conservative Revolution, that says traditional families yield safer and healthier children than non-traditional ones. Shorten is a stepfather and took offence at the sentiments. Bernardi was also heavily criticised from within the Coalition ranks, with fellow Liberals saying the views weren\u2019t reflective of a modern Australia. The Liberal senator Michaelia Cash is the only Coalition MP slated to speak at the ACL conference. She will use her position as the minister assisting the prime minister for women to discuss how to better protect women at risk both domestically and abroad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
