Set in the Middle East, The Rock Pile will tell the story of a Jerusalem correspondent for Time magazine who discovers three boys of different faiths who become friends through their love of football. In a statement, Blair said: \u201cGiven my own foundation\u2019s work in Israel and Palestine, and Tony [Blair]\u2019s work on the Middle East peace process, we are deeply aware of the human cost of the conflict and the benefit of bringing stories about the reality on the ground to a global audience. Stories like The Rock Pile can alter people\u2019s understanding, foster engagement and ultimately trigger action for change.\u201d The Rock Pile will be directed by British film-maker John Deery and star Hugh Bonneville, while Blair joins former Sun editor David Yelland on the list of executive producers. Barack and Michelle Obama signed a deal with Netflix in April to produce film and TV shows about \u201cissues of race and class, democracy and civil rights\u201d, while the Clintons are working on \u201ca pipeline of programmes\u201d of \u201cfemale-centric content\u201d. In 2018 Hillary Clinton joined with Steven Spielberg to executive produce The Women\u2019s Hour, a TV series about the fight to secure female suffrage in the US."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
