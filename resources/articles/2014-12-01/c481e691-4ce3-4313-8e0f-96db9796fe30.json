It was a miracle that he kept them in the Champions League.\u201d Pardew was shocked by those Arsenal fans who booed and heckled Wenger at Stoke station last Saturday, after a 3-2 defeat by Mark Hughes\u2019s side. \u201cThe incident at the train station was totally disrespectful,\u201d he added. \u201cI think 90% of Arsenal fans would have been ashamed of that and we could get the backlash of it. The crowd on Saturday will want to show how much they love him. After Sir Alex Ferguson he\u2019s the best manager in Premier League history. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho hasn\u2019t done enough yet.\u201d Pardew feels the media, both social and traditional, have a lot to answer for. \u201cI think everyone at Arsenal knows Ars\u00e8ne\u2019s done a magnificent job \u2013 but all of us managers are on six- or seven-game trials with the media and social media. We have to accept that. Ars\u00e8ne knows instant results are massive, even for someone who has been in the position as long as he has.\u201d Wenger\u2019s pain at the Stoke defeat may have been slightly assuaged by the news that Newcastle had ended Chelsea\u2019s unbeaten run and, more pertinently, torn up their embryo \u201cInvincibles\u201d tag by beating them 2-1 at St James\u2019 Park last Saturday. \u201cYes, I imagine Ars\u00e8ne might have had a glass of wine after that result,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen that Invincibles tag belongs to you you don\u2019t want to lose it to anyone but we can only worry about us.\u201d The trip to the Emirates, where the novice goalkeeper Jak Alnwick will make only his second appearance for Newcastle, represents a daunting challenge. \u201cArs\u00e8ne\u2019s squad is very strong at the moment and they are playing a slightly more conservative game so I think it will be tight,\u201d said Pardew, who expects to be on cordial terms with the coach in the adjacent dug-out. \u201cI\u2019ve had one run-in with Ars\u00e8ne when I was at West Ham and there was a last-minute goal but otherwise he\u2019s been fantastic with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have nothing but respect for him and I\u2019ve always enjoyed watching his teams.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
