It found that the Asian tsunami and the Make Poverty History campaign has prompted more people into charitable behaviour. But they seem to have affected some more than others. More than a quarter of women, compared with only one in five men, said they were more likely to give this year. Similarly 55% of women compared to 47% of men said they donated to charity on an ad hoc basis. Two fifths of young people said they were more likely to support a charity this year, compared with 24% of UK population as a whole. In Scotland a third of people said they were more likely to give this year. This finding about the Scots is backed by a study last month, which found that Scotland was the most generous nation in the British Isles. Today's survey is conducted to mark the start of Oxfam's I'm in campaign, which is aimed at persuading a million people (whoever you are) to pledge to more to help tackle poverty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
