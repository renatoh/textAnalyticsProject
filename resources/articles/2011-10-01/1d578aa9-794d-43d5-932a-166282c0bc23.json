The numbers on the squares are 59, 60, 61 and 65. If she steps on three of the squares, she'll win \u00a325,000. But if she steps on the fourth \u2013 boom! \u2013 she goes home with nothing. No, sorry, that's wrong; she gets to keep the \u00a32,500 she's already won. But still, this new game show, High Stakes (ITV1) is not unlike an afternoon stroll in Helmand province. So, Jane's got a 75% chance of success, careful now Jane ... Oh, wait, because she can take a clue if she likes, a clue to which square to avoid. She does, sensibly. OK, so the clue to the number on the square to avoid is: the maximum number of points scored from a single throw in World Championship Darts. Yay! That's easy, isn't it? Jane's going to be in the money \u2026 You are kidding, she doesn't flipping know! How can she not know? She's from Wolverhampton, that's all they do there, play darts. Even so though, there's still only a 25% chance of failure. And hold up, here's yet more help, from Jeremy, who does play darts. \"You've got the bull at 50, you've got half the bull at 25,\" he says. \"You've got doubles and you've got trebles, and 20's the highest number, and treble twenty is 60 ...\" Who's Jeremy? Jeremy Kyle, Prince of Schlock, and the host of High Stakes. And he hasn't just given Jane another clue, he's told her the answer, spelt it out practically, s-i-x-t-y. Imagine the other quizmaster Jezza \u2013 Paxman \u2013 doing that on University Challenge. \"Take your time Magdalen, no hurry at all, oh and don't worry if you don't know the answer, in fact I'll tell you, it's Andrea Palladio ...\" You could argue it takes something \u2013 the whole point? \u2013 away from a quiz show. Anyway, back to High Stakes. \"So, what, are we going for, 60?\" Jane asks. \"What did you just say? Are we going for 60?\" says Jeremy, pointing at the big orange \"AVOID\" in the clue. Jeremy's used to idiocy, but even he is beginning to sound a little exasperated. \"Oh, yeah,\" says Jane. \"Are we avoiding 60?\" To be fair to Jane, the rules are quite complicated: squares are to be avoided not chosen, but you can choose to have a clue or not. It's to do with the never-ending struggle to come up with new formats for the television quiz show. But the point is, it doesn't matter, because if he knows it, Jeremy will tell you the answer. If he likes you. I felt a bit sorry for the earlier contestant, James, a DJ with peroxided hair (another rule of High Stakes is that you, and all your entire family, have to be blond). James had to avoid the date, in January, of Burns Night. Jeremy did hint that it might be a month after Christmas, but James wasn't listening, or didn't understand the rules, stood on the wrong square, and went home. Jeremy's not letting that happen to Jane though \u2013 he practically picks her up and puts her on a square that means she'll take \u00a325,000 back to the Black Country. And guess what, she does. To return to my earlier (admittedly rather poor taste) analogy, it might be like going for a stroll in Helmand Province, but the quiz-Taliban have left their wires sticking out of the ground; you have the map of where everything is; and, in Jeremy, you're got the best bomb-disposal sniffer dog in the world. Me, My Sex &amp; I (BBC1) was a fascinating documentary about people who are born neither entirely female nor entirely male, something that's more common than a lot of us knew. This was a model difficult-subject film \u2013 it was neither a freak show, nor did it avoid the difficult issues, about \"down there\" stuff. It was sensible, delicate and sober, but also very touching. And it threw up some big questions about whether there's more to sex and gender than one of two boxes on a form to tick. Possibly not the best one to watch on the way to a 20-week pregnancy scan though. Or on the way to the labour ward if you don't know. \"It's a little \u2026 oh \u2026 hmmm \u2026 not sure.\" And I don't think there are congratulatory greetings cards for an \"intersex\" situation are there? Could be a gap in the market, one for Dragons' Den."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
