Tudor, a replacement for Darren Gough, arrived late yesterday with the rest of the squad after a turbulent landing in keeping with the experience of the past few days. He will play in the three-day match against Australia A starting here on Friday and be joined in the team by Silverwood, who has been called to the colours following the serious knee injury suffered by Simon Jones in the first Test defeat. Along with Steve Harmison the pair are competing for perhaps two places for the Adelaide Test, with Matthew Hoggard also vulnerable after maulings in his last four Tests. Now Gough has gone Tudor is England's most experienced bowler in Australia, with seven wickets from two Tests in 1998, including four on his debut in Perth. Tudor's constitution has been viewed with suspicion ever since and, instead of making the original touring party, he was sent to the Academy for a second successive year. Now Tudor believes he is stronger both mentally and physically and ready to dispel the doubts about his stamina and commitment. \"I've been working on my action a little and the basic fitness work we have done has been good because I feel a lot fitter. \"We had four weights sessions a week and, if you don't improve with that sort of schedule, then you're struggling. I was happy with the way I went about my training. It's a tough regime at the Academy but it's good and makes you a strong person mentally and I think in the last three weeks I've matured as a person by the experience.\" He says that the criticism of his stamina and mental strength is a mystery to him. \"During the season I only missed two weeks, and that because of sore shins,\" he said. \"I bowled my overs for Surrey and for England, so I don't know where this stuff about me not having any stamina came from. Anyone can improve on their fitness, and I'm no differ ent, but at times it's difficult to take criticism like that.\" Silverwood, on the other hand, finds himself in Australia after a spell in the wilderness. \"I'm at the back of the pecking order and it's up to me to work hard now and force my way up the order,\" said the Pontefract man, whose last appearancewas during the infamous final Test victory over South Africa in Centurion three years ago. \"The only real chance I've got is this game on Friday but, if you've got a chance, you've got to take it. It's up to me to force my way in and, if I'm bowling well, then hopefully the chance will come along.\" Silverwood has played in five Tests, his best return being five for 91 in Cape Town. But he lacks the accuracy to put the best players under consistent pressure. As someone once said, he will run through a brick wall for you without necessarily being able to hit it. \u00b7 The former England A seamer Alamgir Sheriyar has signed a two-year deal with Kent after being released from his contract at his own request by Worcestershire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
