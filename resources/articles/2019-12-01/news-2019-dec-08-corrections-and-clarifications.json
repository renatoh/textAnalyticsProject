In fact, it was worth \u00a322.4m, which in turn meant that non-NHS providers had already agreed contracts for \u00a33.1bn of services this year, not \u00a33.3bn. Further, the article said that the awarding of the contracts \u201ccast[s] doubt on \u2026 repeated Conservative denials during the election campaign that the NHS is not for sale\u201d.
