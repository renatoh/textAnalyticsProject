He's arguably the best-known exponent of soukous, the guitar-based style that evolved from Congolese rumba to captivate dancers right across Africa and beyond, and he is famous both for his rousing live shows and for the classic recordings he made after moving to Paris in 1979. Since then, he has relocated once again, this time to Manchester, and has continued to tour and record. This latest set shows that he is still capable of smooth, gently driving vocals, but it never captures the exhilaration of the glory days, when he worked with exceptional guitarists such as Diblo Dibala. Instead, he's backed by a cheerfully heavy-handed band, with a keyboard player trying to sound like a horn section. The soukous dance workouts are mixed with a slushy, half-spoken Afro-pop ballad, My Life, which includes unexpected echoes of township jive and was recorded in Johannesburg. Kanda Bongo Man is a star - but before buying this set, dig out his Very Best Of album of recordings from the 80s and 90s."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
