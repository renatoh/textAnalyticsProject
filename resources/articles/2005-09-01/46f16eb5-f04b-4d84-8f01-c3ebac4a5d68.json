I parked on a yellow line - I thought legally - but still got a \u00a350 ticket. It seems further up the road there was a (barely noticeable) sign about a parking suspension. But my friends say it's just not worth challenging the council, you never win and they'll just double the charge. Is it worth having a go? Follow the Highway Code Look in the Highway Code and you will see you are only allowed to park on a yellow line if there is a sign telling you when parking is allowed. It is your responsibility to look for it. If there is no such sign parking is not allowed. Therefore it would be counterproductive to challenge the council. Frances Wilde, Carmarthen Don't bother How much do you value your time? The minimum wage of \u00a35 an hour or \u00a350 an hour as a professional person? The amount of time you will spend contesting the fine will cost you more than the fine itself. Don't bother. Mark Charlton, Hessle Do it now Get your letter contesting the fine in asap. Once the council receives it they have to put your case on hold while the ticket is investigated. This means the penalty charge value is also put on hold, so even if it takes them eight months to make a decision against you, you only pay the original fine so you can't lose. Who knows, you might win. David Jones, Richmond Pay the fine you selfish oaf Pay up, stop complaining and don't be so selfish in future. Parking suspension or not, double-yellow lines are there for a reason: to give access to emergency vehicles, to give clear sightlines at junctions, or to help bus operators (and hence their passengers). The 30% of households who do not have access to a car manage perfectly well without abusing them, and even those with cars benefit from clearer roads. What made you think you were above the law? Given the millions nuisance parking costs the country in traffic delays every year, I'd say \u00a350 is reasonable. Pay up and in future conduct your business in a more considerate manner, for instance by finding a legal parking space and walking to your destination, or even using sustainable transport. Noam Bleicher, by email It's worth a try Definitely challenge it. I had a similar experience. I went to the town hall, where I was given an appeal form to fill in, on which I explained how I had parked in good faith, used a legal ticket and had not intended to defraud the council. And they withdrew the fine! It was also explained to me that a fine is not doubled if an appeal is made - only if there is a failure to pay within the stipulated time if the appeal is refused. Liz Brynin, Hove Say you're sorry I was so convinced I'd parked legally that I went back to the spot to prove it armed with my digital camera, but I was wrong, I'd misread the notice. So, I decided to creep instead. I wrote to the council and apologised for my mistake - amazingly they replied that this time they would cancel the fine but told me not to do it again. Give it a go - you've nothing to lose by pretending to eat humble pie. Jean Knowles, Manchester Act stupid To avoid further charges, pay the \u00a350, with an accompanying letter explaining why the fine should be refunded. If you do not receive a satisfactory response, telephone and ask to speak to the person in charge (you should at least get a name). Follow this with a letter to him/her, again stating the reasons why you should receive a refund. This worked for me when my pay-and-display ticket blew off my car window - I had no idea until I returned to find a parking ticket. It took three letters and two phone calls but was worth it in the end. Hilary Coulthurst, Doncaster Don't take no for answer If your council rejects your initial objection you will be given the option of going to appeal. As a serial opponent of the type of trigger-happy penalizing, I can vouch for the occasional fairness of the independent adjudicators to whom your case will be referred. Take pictures, argue clearly and above all don't succumb to friends' passivity or your council's intimidation. My win put a smile on my face for days. James Bowe, London Beat the bureaucrats If you think you have a good case, it's well worth taking them on. I appealed to the London parking and traffic appeals service (www.parkingandtrafficappeals.gov.uk) and they upheld my appeal on the grounds that there was insufficient information displayed on the operation of a scheme in Cardiff. I did not have to pay the fine, but there was no compensation for the expense incurred in making the appeal. However, there was much satisfaction at beating the bureaucrats. Peter Lobban, Shrewsbury I was livid but gave up I too was livid. Parking in a strange part of town, I discovered the hard way that roadworks had obliterated the no-parking road markings. I submitted photos proving this but the answer came back that at the time of the offence the road markings were clear. I gave up. Geoff Weston, Leicester My basketcase ticket was suspended Do not worry about the charge doubling to \u00a3100. If you start the appeals process, most councils suspend the deadline pending the outcome. The plate stating the restrictions should be clearly shown. Consider taking a photograph to support your appeal. I successfully appealed a parking ticket in Guildford, because the plate was obstructed by hanging baskets. Your case seems similar. James Lofting, Aldershot They are paid to thwart you Statistically it's worth appealing. An article in August Which? magazine shows that between 56% and 81% of appeals which get as far as national adjudication are successful, and that doesn't include fines cancelled by councils beforehand. But in my experience it takes determination and time, which a successful appeal will not pay for, and this is what dodgy councils are relying on. You undoubtedly have better things to do, whereas the council has a whole department of bureaucrats paid to thwart you. If you do appeal, expect to meet bullying, obstruction and incompetence. Send all letters by recorded delivery and file all replies. If possible, photograph the site, the position of your car and the notice. John Parfitt, Bristol Suck up to them You have committed an offence, but so had I when I placed a ticket upside down on my dashboard and was fined \u00a330 for failing to display it. I wrote a humble letter admitting a technical breach of the law and explaining the mitigating circumstances (I was in a hurry etc). I enclosed a cheque for \u00a330, which was returned to me within a few days. Bill Lythgoe, Wigan Appeal now You should look at www.appealnow.com. It generates your parking ticket appeal at the touch of a button. Peter Salter, London Grovel Protest away. I got a ticket in March while attending a job interview that ran late. I wrote a letter to the council explaining why I was late, apologised and thanked them for improving my knowledge of local parking laws. They withdrew the fine. So do a bit of groveling. N Owen, West Yorkshire Get legal Many tickets are issued incorrectly. First, look at the ticket carefully: are all the details such as your vehicle description exactly correct? If not the ticket may be unenforceable. Secondly, take photos of the scene that demonstrate the lack of adequate signage. Using these as evidence, write to your council explaining the situation. The council is obliged to consider any exceptional reason why it should not pursue a ticket, and most will stop the clock giving a further 14 days to pay at the reduced rate. If this is rejected then you will have the opportunity to make a formal representation to the council after receiving your notice to owner. If still unsatisfied you can appeal to an independent adjudicator. Over 50% of appeals are successful - indeed 30% of the time councils don't even bother to contest them, meaning you win automatically. Winning means your ticket is cancelled. Jonathan Dillon, Manchester Same story I was fined \u00a350 when I bought a ticket to park but (stupidly) put it on the dash upside down. Technically I was eligible to pay the fine. But I sent a photocopy of the ticket along with the fine to my local council and explained the situation. They wrote back to say the fine had been cancelled. You've nothing to lose. Matt Wright, Enfield You may as well There is a parking ticket ombudsman. The websites are www.parkingandtrafficappeals.gov.uk for London, and www.parking-appeals.gov.uk for the rest of the country. If you've got the energy to write to the paper about it, you might as well spare a few minutes to save yourself \u00a350. George Morgan, Glasgow Stuff up the system I have challenged nearly every parking ticket I've received since I moved to London. I have a 50% success rate. My theory is if everyone challenged their parking tickets for a month it would cause so much paperwork that the entire system would break down and the authorities would be forced to rethink their strategy on issuing so many tickets. I think this works for speeding and congestion charge too. Thomas Parrott, London Appeal and waste their (our) money I won an appeal last year. Only 1% of people appeal, yet 59% are successful. The whole process took eight months and you will have the satisfaction of knowing, even if you fail at adjudication, that it cost the council far more the \u00a3100 to administer your appeal. Naomi McGoun, Greenwich You have a case If the sign was not clear and there was a recent change to the parking restrictions, albeit temporarily, then it sounds as though you should have a case. In any case, the council should be notified so that they can correct this. Stef McCarthy, London Bash on and you'll beat them My daughter parked in a council car park. She paid her pay and display, but got a ticket because she'd parked in an area reserved for contract-only clients. The signs were not clear so I made a case on her behalf, complete with photos. Eventually I took the case to the independent parking ombudsman but two weeks before the case was to be heard, the council threw in the towel, largely because the car park signage had been redesigned because it was unclear. The council knew they had a poorly-signed car park, yet bashed on with their action against my daughter. Tim Webster, Diss Yes, yes, yes When the same thing happened to me in Camden my car was towed away. It cost \u00a3175 to release the car. I paid my fine to pick up the car, then fought it and won. They eventually agreed with me and refunded the money. In fact they refunded it twice, so I made a profit. Go for it, and keep going for it.
