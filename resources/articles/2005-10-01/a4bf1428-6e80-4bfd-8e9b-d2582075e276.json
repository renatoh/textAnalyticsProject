I've served in third world countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia and I've asked to extend my stay here. Yet according to a new \"liveability ranking\", it is the worst place in the world. The ranking's criteria - stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education and infrastructure - do raise problems. As PNG suffers from a lack of roads, air transport is the practical means by which to reach other towns, even from the capital. Education is another problem, although quality education is available to those who can afford it. As many as 80% of people in Port Moresby are unemployed and crime is very high. The streets are unpredictable and can be extremely dangerous. Armed carjackings are a fact of life, though the \"raskols\", as they are known, are generally content just to take the vehicle. The game, it seems, particularly in the Australian press, is to run the place down, but it's really not as bad as it is painted. When I told indigenous colleagues about the report (devised by the Economist Intelligence Unit) there was not much of a response. In some hairier neighbourhoods, there are indeed local residents who live in fear. But we have at least 1,000 British passport holders in the country and consular cases are few and far between. The expatriates here are not stupid. They are aware that Port Moresby is a dangerous place. But they behave sensibly, don't give an inviting appearance as victims, and almost all their movements are in vehicles. A lot of people fall in love with the place; they let it get under their skin and they stay here. What makes a place is its people and many here are warm and friendly. As an expat you can and do make friends easily with local people. And they are particularly warm towards the British: they love the Queen (\"Misis Kwin\") and Princess Anne made a very popular visit to Port Moresby last week to help commemorate the 30th anniversary of independence from Australia. Culturally, Papua New Guinea and - by urban-drift extension - Port Moresby are very diverse. There are about 1,000 different clans in the country and perhaps as many as 850 languages. Port Moresby is actually a fairly small town in the populous National Capital District and you're not exactly spoilt for choice. Yet there are several good restaurants. Clubbing is a bit different, but there are certainly clubs to go to. The better places to eat, drink and be merry generally have both perimeter security and guards on gates and doors; the well-stocked supermarkets, too. The climate is special - excellent in winter, with a pleasant, cool temperature in the evening and early morning. And with more than 31 years in the service behind me, I now have the best view I've ever had, anywhere. With my daybreak cuppas, I look over the port and across the inlet to the hills. The scene is as bonny as any loch. And the sunsets are almost always glorious. There may be 126 \"better\" towns to live in, but there are surely thousands worse. \u00b7 Alastair Dent is Britain's deputy high commissioner in Papua New Guinea."}, "isHosted": false}}}
