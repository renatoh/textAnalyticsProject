The report, which rates the world\u2019s 35 biggest insurers on their actions on fossil fuels, declares that coal \u2013 the biggest single contributor to climate change \u2013 \u201cis on the way to becoming uninsurable\u201d as most coal projects cannot be financed, built or operated without insurance. Ten firms moved to restrict the insurance cover they offer to companies that build or operate coal power plants in 2019, taking the global total to 17, said the Unfriend Coal campaign, which includes 13 environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Client Earth and Urgewald, a German NGO. The report will be launched at an insurance and climate risk conference in London on Monday, as the UN climate summit gets under way in Madrid. The first insurers to exit coal policies were all European, but since March, two US insurers \u2013 Chubb and Axis Capital \u2013 and the Australian firms QBE and Suncorp have pledged to stop or restrict insurance for coal projects. At least 35 insurers with combined assets of $8.9tn, equivalent to 37% of the insurance industry\u2019s global assets, have begun pulling out of coal investments. A year ago, 19 insurers holding more than $6tn in assets were divesting from fossil fuels. Peter Bosshard, one of the Unfriend Coal campaign co-ordinators, said: \u201cWe hope within two to three years it will be so difficult to obtain insurance that most coal projects won\u2019t be able to go forward. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the acceleration [in firms pulling out of coal] for a good reason \u2013 people are freaking out.\u201d As global temperatures climb, hurricanes, wildfires and floods have become more frequent and severe, resulting in higher claims bills for insurers. Lloyd\u2019s, the world\u2019s biggest insurance market, is the only major European firm which continues to insure new coal projects. Bosshard said it had a critical role to play: \u201cTogether with Asian insurers, the Lloyd\u2019s market is becoming the \u2018insurer of last resort\u2019 for a dying and destructive industry.\u201d Lloyd\u2019s started excluding coal from its investments in its own \u00a34bn central mutual fund in April 2018. However, its chief executive John Neal last month ruled out issuing guidelines on underwriting coal projects to its member syndicates. Lloyd\u2019s said: \u201cWe take climate change extremely seriously and recognise the important role insurance can play in supporting, accelerating and de-risking the transition to a low carbon economy. \u201cWhilst Lloyd\u2019s Corporation does not set underwriting policy in the market, except if there is a specific legal or regulatory requirement to do so, we are nevertheless committed to building consensus across the 90-plus syndicates that operate at Lloyd\u2019s about how we make this transition.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
