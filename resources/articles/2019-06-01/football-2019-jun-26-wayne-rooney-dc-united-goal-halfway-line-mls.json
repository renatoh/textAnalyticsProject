On Wednesday night he scored for DC United from beyond the halfway line for one of the best goals of his long career. The goal came in the 10th minute of DC\u2019s game against Orlando City. Rooney picked up the ball in his own half and say Orlando goalkeeper Brian Rowe well off his line. He proceeded to drive the ball over Rowe, and was promptly mobbed by his teammates. It proved to be the only goal of the game. Rooney joined DC United last year with the club bottom of the Eastern Conference. He then inspired them to the playoffs. This season they currently sit third in the table. Three former Manchester United players are now in MLS\u2019s top-five scorers this season. As well as Rooney, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Nani are also in the top five."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
