I'm playing the Assembly Rooms in the Ballroom. It's one of the most gorgeous rooms I've ever seen in my life, but it's a bit echoey, and I can't think on my feet when I've got an echo. There's a chance tonight I'm going to go on with earplugs on. Tell us about the new show, Posturing Delivery. It's about male broodiness and why this debate seems to be owned by female voices. The thought recently occurred to me: what if I'm someone who never has kids? And I just started to panic. But when I said that to a friend, they laughed in my face as though it wasn't an appropriately male thought. Why do you think that is? There's the biological reality that women will throw back at you: \"It's different for men, the clock isn't ticking like it is for girls.\" I wanted to explore that. I don't see why my clock isn't ticking. Just because I'm fertile doesn't mean I want to get a girl up the duff when I'm 80. How's life been since Edinburgh 2011? It's like someone's switched the telly switch on: it's brilliant. I've been hanging out with Melvyn Bragg, talking about class \u2013 then bring up a chart of farts on [his BBC3 show] Britain Unzipped. My novel The Humorist has come out and I've just guest-hosted Open Book when Mariella Frostrup was on holiday. Then I've done a show with Greg James on Radio 1. The comedian Chris Ramsey calls me a one-man walking Venn diagram. I fully embrace that. And this year you're playing the book festival as well as the Fringe? It's a lot less stressful doing books than comedy, I'll tell you that. I don't have any \"I hope the chairs are set up right\" or \"Will the sound work properly?\" Favourite Edinburgh watering hole? The truth is, I have to fight the urge to go back home, have a glass of wine and watch a movie on my own. Otherwise, I'd be at the Pleasance Courtyard, just soaking up the atmosphere. Old Town or New Town? If I could get a flat on Cowgate, I'd probably stay in it. You'd feel like a goblin, walking out under those archways. It's cool. Festival diet, in a sentence. I try to keep myself as fit as possible, and for my first meal I cooked a vegetarian chilli haggis with fresh herbs and spices. Any insider tips? I've been banging the drum about Chris Ramsey from day one. But to see what he's gone on to: the strength and confidence of him is unbelievable. And Cardinal Burns's is the only show where I would take a box of tissues and just show myself up, crying with laughter. At 11am, we'd find you \u2026 Killing my technical staff because there's an echo in my venue. And 11pm? Backstage, crying about the echo not being fixed. I wish I was making that up. \u2022 Russell Kane's Posturing Delivery is at the Assembly Rooms until 24 August.
