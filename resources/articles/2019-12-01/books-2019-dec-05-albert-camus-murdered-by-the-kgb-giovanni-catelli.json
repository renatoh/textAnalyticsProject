Italian author Giovanni Catelli first aired his theory in 2011, writing in the newspaper Corriere della Sera that he had discovered remarks in the diary of the celebrated Czech poet and translator Jan Z\u00e1brana that suggested Camus\u2019s death had not been an accident. Now Catelli has expanded on his research in a book titled The Death of Camus. Camus died on 4 January 1960 when his publisher Michel Gallimard lost control of his car and it crashed into a tree. The author was killed instantly, with Gallimard dying a few days later. Three years earlier, the author of L\u2019\u00c9tranger (The Outsider) and La Peste (The Plague) had won the Nobel prize for \u201cilluminat[ing] the problems of the human conscience in our times\u201d. \u201cThe accident seemed to have been caused by a blowout or a broken axle; experts were puzzled by its happening on a long stretch of straight road, a road 30 feet wide, and with little traffic at the time,\u201d Herbert Lottman wrote in his 1978 biography of the author. Catelli believes a passage in Z\u00e1brana\u2019s diaries explains why: the poet wrote in the late summer of 1980 that \u201ca knowledgeable and well-connected man\u201d had told him the KGB was to blame. \u201cThey rigged the tyre with a tool that eventually pierced it when the car was travelling at high speed.\u201d The order, he said, had been issued by Dmitri Shepilov, a senior Soviet politician, in retaliation for an article by Camus in the French newspaper Franc-Tireur published in March 1957. \u201cIt seems it took the intelligence three years to carry out the order,\u201d Z\u00e1brana\u2019s diary reports. \u201cThey managed eventually and in such a way that, until today, everyone thought Camus had died because of an ordinary car crash. The man refused to tell me his source but he claimed it was completely reliable.\u201d Camus had sided publicly with the Hungarian uprising since autumn 1956, and was highly critical of Soviet actions. He also publicly praised and supported the Russian author Boris Pasternak, who was seen as anti-Soviet. Catelli has spent years researching the validity of Z\u00e1brana\u2019s account. In his book, he interviews Z\u00e1brana\u2019s widow Marie, investigates the KGB\u2019s infiltration of France, and includes secondhand testimony from the controversial French lawyer Jacques Verg\u00e8s. Catelli was contacted by Giuliano Spazzali, an Italian barrister, after the book\u2019s publication in Italy. Spazzali recounted a conversation he\u2019d had with the late Verg\u00e8s about Camus\u2019 death. \u201cVerg\u00e8s said the accident had been staged. It is my opinion that Verg\u00e8s had more evidence than he cared to share with me. I refrained from asking,\u201d Spazzali told Catelli. \u201cDiscretion is the best attitude when a hot topic rises unexpectedly. I didn\u2019t investigate any further, and yet I remember how Verg\u00e8s was certain that the staged accident was schemed by a KGB section with the endorsement of the French intelligence.\u201d Catelli argues that Camus\u2019 outspokenness was interfering with French-Soviet relations, and \u201cCamus\u2019 prominent character \u2026 stood out in the eyes of the French people as a reminder of the USSR\u2019s cruel imperialism. Both the French and the Soviet governments would have benefited greatly from silencing this unpleasant reminder \u2026 No proper investigation was carried out.\u201d Catelli\u2019s said his theory had not been endorsed by Camus\u2019 daughter Catherine, who prohibited publisher Gallimard from quoting her father\u2019s work. The book has nonetheless been published in France, Argentina and Italy, and received the backing of Paul Auster, who called Catelli\u2019s argument compelling. \u201cA horrible conclusion, but after digesting the evidence Catelli has given us, it becomes difficult not to agree with him. Thus \u2018car accident\u2019 should now be filed in another drawer as \u2018political assassination\u2019 \u2013 and thus Albert Camus was silenced when he was 46 years old,\u201d writes Auster in a foreword. \u201cI hope that the academics will not follow the old opinion that it was a simple accident,\u201d said Catelli, who is talking to British publishers about an English translation. \u201cI think we owe it to the memory of Albert Camus.\u201d Cambridge French literature professor Alison Finch was not persuaded. \u201cSupporters of the assassination theory include a creative writer and film director (Paul Auster); a Czech writer and translator whose family were persecuted by the communist regime and who had good reason to hate communism (Jan Z\u00e1brana); the highly controversial lawyer Jacques Verg\u00e8s, who, to be sure, defended Algerian independence fighters tortured by the French but who became infamous for defending the indefensible. Of course, this is what the law must do, but in general he\u2019d be regarded as a maverick rather than a reliable commentator.\u201d Finch also questioned suggestions of French connivance. \u201cThis would mean that the assassination was approved at the highest level and presumably by De Gaulle. This, to me, is implausible. De Gaulle, an accomplished writer himself, had great respect for French intellectuals, including those whose views he disagreed with,\u201d she said. The Death of Camus draws to a close with Catelli expressing the hope that it will bring forth more evidence, \u201cbefore the waves of time come to lay waste to the sandy, frail traces of what happened\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 December to remove a reference to Dmitri Shepilov having been the Soviet Union\u2019s \u201cminister of internal affairs\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
