GAFFE OF THE DAY G\u00f3mez's teammate Ali al-Habsi: normally watertight, he showed all the focus of a show-boating eight-year-old in fumbling a catch over his head into his own net. RUNNER-UP Sunderland keeper Simon Mignolet. His ricket was inevitable the moment Martin O'Neill bigged him up pre-match. \"He's really fantastic,\" said O'Neill. \"Any accolades bestowed on him he really deserves.\" STAT OF THE DAY 18: The number of points Manchester United have won from losing positions this season \u2013 more than any other side. SLUR OF THE DAY The vidiprinter: causing a Twitter storm after claiming PFA chairman Clarke Carlisle was sent off for foul and abusive language. The Northampton defender was actually shown two yellows for two bad tackles. Carlisle: \"There were no verbals at all.\" SHOCK OF THE DAY Inverness, a week after being picked apart in a 5-1 home mauling by Motherwell, beating Celtic 1-0 away: their first ever league win at Celtic Park. BUSIEST WEEK Reading's @seanmorrison_91: rounded off a busy few days spent reviewing breakfast cereals on Twitter (Choco porridge was \"too hot in places, stodgy texture and blandish taste\" in a microwave, but \"Hollllyyyyy hell! Perfect consistency\" on the hob) with a thumping goal at Wigan. FOX IN THE BOX Reluctant intervention of the day: an Ebbsfleet steward called on to the pitch after fox excrement was discovered mid-match against Hereford \"in and around\" the penalty area."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
