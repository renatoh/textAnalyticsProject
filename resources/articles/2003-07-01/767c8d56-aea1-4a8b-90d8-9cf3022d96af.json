In David Beckham's case it's tonsorial. For Australian rugby players getting ready for the World Cup there in October image means money, intrigue and bad blood. Tony Dempsey, head of Australia's Rugby Union Players Association, alleged last week that South African players had been bribed by the Australian Rugby Union to sign their World Cup contracts. 'It is my understanding,' Dempsey said, 'that the South African players received financial compensation as a means of inducing them to sign the International Rugby Board participation agreement.' The South Africans were the first to sign, but Dempsey, who is also head of the International Rugby Players Association, claims a lot of other teams have problems with the revised contract, which covers image rights. Meanwhile, the ARU chairman John O'Neill said the new agreement was 'a victory for commonsense'. What it is, though, is another episode in the long-running argument between athletes and their governing bodies over who owns the right to use their image. It will come as no surprise to anyone that Australian officials and players (or, rather, their highly paid lawyers) are due to meet in the NSW Supreme Court tomorrow. There is hardly a corner of sport not attended by lawyers, and image rights is the most profitable field of all. And there are no winners - apart from those same lawyers. Cricket is also embroiled in an image-rights row, fallout over the compromise made with the Indian players before the World Cup in South Africa. As ever, there will be more compromise. The history of image-rights rows is a sorry one. England's cricketers have had theirs in recent years, Beckham and Manchester United could not agree on terms, Ian Botham (below) and Eddie Irvine have had to go to court to protect their rights, Mike Tyson isn't quite sure what happened to his image rights - or his image. The South African rugby machine, meanwhile, is looking a little desperate. A businessman has started a fundraising campaign for $1million to employ the American motivational 'guru' Tony Robbins to transform the team into world-beaters. Mr Robbins has a bit of an image problem himself - a smile so insincere you could drive a rolling maul through it. You've read the piece, now have your say.
