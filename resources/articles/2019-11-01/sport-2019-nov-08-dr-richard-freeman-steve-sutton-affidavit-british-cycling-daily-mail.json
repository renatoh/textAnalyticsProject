Mary O\u2019Rourke, the QC acting for Freeman, said the affidavit was held in the managing editor of the newspaper\u2019s safe as \u201can insurance policy against any potential claims for defamation by Sir Bradley Wiggins, Freeman or Sir Dave Brailsford\u201d and that it contained \u201ca number of lies\u201d. Sutton had also been Wiggins\u2019 personal coach, a key cog in his Tour de France victory in 2012, before the two men fell out. \u201cThe statement came into existence in or around September or October 2016 and it is a statement made by Mr Sutton for the purposes of supporting a story run by the Daily Mail and its then chief sports correspondent Matt Lawton,\u201d O\u2019Rourke added. \u201cIts relation to this proceeding is in fact it contains a number of lies. It is totally inconsistent with evidence Mr Sutton subsequently gave to the DCMS inquiry in parliament where he will have given evidence under the position of being on oath.\u201d The Medical Tribunal Practitioners Service in Manchester then heard Simon Jackson QC outline the General Medical Council\u2019s case against Freeman who, he said, had \u201clied and been evasive\u201d at every stage of an investigation into an order of 30 sachets of the banned drug Testogel. Jackson said Freeman had acquired the Testogel not to treat Sutton\u2019s erectile dysfunction, as he had claimed, but to give microdoses of testosterone to an unnamed cyclist. \u201cTestogel was used not for clinical or therapeutic use but for prohibited use \u2013 namely microdosing as a way of improving an athlete\u2019s performance,\u201d he added. Jackson then explained how Freeman had tried to cover his tracks when the order of Testogel was discovered in a package opened by the British Cycling physiotherapist Phil Burt in 2011. Burt immediately took the package to Dr Steve Peters, the head of medicine at British Cycling, who was in his office with Freeman. Jackson said that when an \u201caghast\u201d Freeman saw the Testogel he exclaimed: \u201cNo, we shouldn\u2019t have this. This is a mistake!\u201d and said it had been sent in error. Jackson claimed that Freeman then applied \u201csoft pressure\u201d to Trish Meats, the office manager at the Oldham-based supplement company Fit4Sport, to get her to write an email saying the Testogel had been ordered in error - even though he knew that was a lie. The tribunal also heard Freeman\u2019s methods could be haphazard and he would leave his office door open \u2013 even though there would be antibiotics and corticosteroids lying on his desk. Jackson said: \u201cAt every stage from 2011 to the present, Dr Freeman has lied, been dishonest and given evasive answers about the Testogel. He has involved others in his scheme of deceit. First he tried to get Fit4Sport to lie for him. Second he asked his distinguished colleague Steve Peters to repeat that lie to the press. Then when he had run out of excuses he then named Shane Sutton as the recipient of the Testogel. \u201cHowever Mr Sutton\u2019s medical records do not support a diagnosis for which testosterone was needed.\u201d The tribunal continues on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
