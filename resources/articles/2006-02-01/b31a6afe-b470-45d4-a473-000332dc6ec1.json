Salaam aleikum.\" Her name is Hamda Fahd Jasem Ali Abd Allah al-Thani, and she has been in prison, and solitary house arrest in Qatar, for three years. Her crime? To marry without her father's permission. Qatar, a tiny state that juts out from Saudi Arabia into the Persian Gulf, has a population of about 863,000, and has been ruled by Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, a racehorse-loving Sandhurst graduate, since 1995, when he ousted his father in a coup; Al-Thanis have run Qatar since the mid-1800s. Hamda was born in 1976, the youngest of six sisters and three brothers. Both her parents are Al-Thani; an uncle on her mother's side was until recently minister of culture; she is thus by birth a sheikha, or princess (of which, it must be said, there are many). As well as being, like most Qataris, conservative Sunni, the Al-Thanis have their own strict sense of family honour. In 2004, the US journal Foreign Affairs noted that in recent years Qatar has made significant strides with regard to women's rights compared to other Gulf states. In 1999, women were allowed to vote. Though in some ways it is simply a measure of the paucity of places to which they can go outside their homes, women now make up 70% of students in higher education: Hamda was in the final year of a degree in business management when her life changed. But Qataris will also be the first to point out that social attitudes alter much more slowly, and it is fair to say that discrimination against women is woven into the fabric of the society. Hamda's particular misfortune, it seems, is that her parents cleave to a more extreme traditionalism than even their own clan. The boys were given their freedom; the girls were hardly ever allowed out. As they became older, their parents took pride in turning suitors away, Hamda's mother apparently boasting about how many men weren't good enough for her daughters. Only one other sister rebelled. She was disowned until she divorced her husband, regardless of the fact that she has children. In 2001 Hamda met Sayed Saley, a 42-year-old Egyptian divorcee, in the Jeddah Sheraton, where for a month she was on holiday with her mother and sisters; he runs a paint company in Saudi Arabia, as well as an import-export office in Cairo. \"She was bubbly and upbeat,\" says Sayed, \"a very nice person, with an excellent character.\" After the Al-Thanis returned to Doha, they spoke frequently on the phone, and emailed, like any other couple; unlike any other couple, they now could not meet. When they decided to marry, Hamda knew what her father's reaction would be, but Sayed insisted that he would ask her father for her hand. But he never got as far as even a meeting: he was simply sent word that the elder Al-Thani had no marriageable daughters. \"She saw that her future was a slow death,\" says Sayed. \"It was her idea to leave the country. She's very brave.\" What she really wanted was to leave that part of the world completely, to come to London, where she believed she would be safe. Sayed counselled against this, believing that the more liberal Cairo, where he had grown up, and where he had work, was perfectly safe enough. \"I am a fool,\" he says now. \"I should have believed her.\" Qatari law forbids any woman under 30 to leave the country without the permission of her father or husband, so she borrowed the passport of a Saudi woman - headscarves make all women from the Gulf look pretty similar, says Sayed, bleakly humorous - and flew secretly to Cairo, leaving her parents a letter informing them of what she had done. Does Sayed think she was using him simply as a means of escape? \"Probably partly, it's quite natural,\" he answers. \"On the other hand, she is refusing to divorce me, she's still asking for her husband - they are offering her anything to tempt her, but she's willing to give up her nationality, her title, her family for me.\" They were married on November 5 2002. None of her family were present, but, \"She was ecstatic,\" Sayed recalls. \"Finally she could have her own home and children. She couldn't believe it.\" Then Hamda received a message from her sisters - who had encouraged her, admiring her for being the one who broke away - her mother was gravely ill with distress. She called home. It was a mercy that probably cost her her freedom. When they found Hamda had disappeared, her parents had reported her to the Qatari authorities as a victim of kidnap, and Sayed maintains that the government offered him $4m to give her up. He says he was not tempted. \"Her littlest fingernail is worth more to me than all the money in the world.\" But the authorities had to be placated. The Egyptians were quickly satisfied: Sayed and Hamda have a legal Egyptian marriage certificate, and Hamda assured them that she had not been abducted. They then went to the Qatari embassy to repeat the process, and to get her a new passport. Again, all seemed to go well, and as they left the building, they had every reason to believe they had a future together. Sayed went to get his car, leaving Hamda on the curb. He returned to see her being bundled into a strange car, screaming for help. They had been married 14 days. \"I went crazy,\" says Sayed. \"I rushed to the embassy. I called her sisters. Four hours later, I discovered that she was back in Doha.\" Soon after she arrived, Hamda managed to get in touch briefly. She said that she had been kidnapped by a member of the Qatari security services, that she had been drugged in the car and had only woken up on the plane. Given the choice of prison or home, she chose prison. She had very few visitors, among them the security service officer and a Yemeni doctor, who gave her injections they said were vitamins. Sayed alleges that Hamda was pregnant and that these injections induced an abortion. She spent six months there, before being moved to another prison for a further six months. After that she was moved home. Hamda has now spent two years locked in an upstairs room in her parents' ageing palace. She is allowed only a Koran and sees other people only when given meals - which do not always appear. Occasionally, they leave her in darkness. She has suffered multiple beatings, often, apparently, from her brother. Amnesty International fears for her safety: if anything more serious should happen to her, who would know? The Arabic press ran stories for a while, then lost interest. Sayed says he appealed to everyone he could think of, and that he has little faith in Arab human rights organisations. He has little faith in the emir either. Pleas to the emir's wife, Sheikha Moza, who heads the Supreme Council for Family Affairs have also elicited no response. The Qatari authorities know about the situation, and profess support for Hamda. They argue, however, that it is difficult for the emir simply to order her release because it would be understood as interference in the authority of not just one father but all Qatari fathers. In other words, while there is no legal support for the father's position, the situation is politically highly sensitive. Apparently, there have been similar cases in the past in which the women involved have been killed. Amnesty, which became involved in 2004, is unable to say exactly how prevalent such treatment of women is, because so often it happens behind closed doors. In September 2004, Amnesty wrote to the Qatari Human Rights Commission about Hamda's case; they did not receive an official reply, only a verbal promise of a \"good outcome\". Last May, Amnesty issued a worldwide appeal, prompting letters to be written directly to the emir. The minister of the interior contacted her family, but without resulting in any change of circumstances. That month, Amnesty received a letter from the emir promising to order an investigation \"as early as possible\". Meanwhile, Sayed says he is putting every spare moment into his attempts to free her. \"I'm pleading for anyone with a grain of sympathy to do something,\" he says. \"I will fight for the rest of my life to free her. I will never give up until one of us dies from the pain\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
