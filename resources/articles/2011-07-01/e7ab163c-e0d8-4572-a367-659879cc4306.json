Pulling out all the stops for its debut on the competitive north-east London party scene, thanks to some nifty programming, local favourite and Hackney's greatest pop diva since Leona Lewis, CocknBullKid, has been placed at the crest of the small but perfectly formed, dancefloor-focused lineup. The ethos behind Lemonade is simple: start the night off with live sets from idiosyncratic electronic artists that'll wow the crowd's minds as well as their dancing feet and then ease into the wee small hours with non-stop party bangers, hectic disco, new wave wonders and techno hits. This week, duo AlunaGeorge, DJ Stopmakingme and Justin Robertson's current project The Deadstock 33s will be rounding out the rowdy raving. The Nest, N16, Sat Leonie Cooper St Pauls Carnival After Party, Bristol The days of partying all night at St Pauls Carnival, one of the UK's longest established Caribbean street parties, are long since gone, and a 9.30pm curfew is strictly enforced. All of which just gives time for a quick scrub-up before heading down to Lakota, which, as well as hosting its own outdoor soundsystem during the day, will be opening its doors for Carnival's official After Party. And this six-room monster is a quite magnificent beast. Drum'n'bass prevails in the main room courtesy of Goldie, Doc Scott, DJ Die and Interface, while Nicky Blackmarket and Serial Killaz are on a ragga tip in room two. There's also spaces for happy hardcore, dubstep and local live bands. Lakota, Upper York St, Sat John Mitchell Big Beat Reunion, Belfast It's funny how the music of the 1990s never managed to become as reviled as that of the 70s or the 80s \u2013 \"Too bland to care about\" is a criticism often levelled at the decade's soundtrack, which nevertheless supplied Britpop, grunge, nu metal and various sub-genres of electronic dance music \u2013 including big beat, currently enjoying a revival of sorts. Despite having less chance of re-entering current popular culture than The Word getting recommissioned, the beats are seemingly as big as ever at clubs across the country as Big Beat Reunion spreads its breakbeats and techno-tinged tentacles far and wide. Following an appearance by Bentley Rhythm Ace several months ago, Skint Records' mixmaster general Cut La Roc shapes samples of classic hip-hop, breaks and funk into a set rich in both nostalgia and future sounds, plus support from Belfast's original big beat pioneer, Ciaran J O'Neill. Love &amp; Death Inc, Ann Street, Fri Patric Baird Peppermint Candy, London With their matching 1920s Lulu bobs, co-ordinating couture and sleek vintage get-ups, you'd be forgiven for thinking that DJ double act the Broken Hearts were a textbook case of style over substance. This chic twosome's impeccable knowledge of all things swing, however, has led them to a fact- and fun-packed radio show on Jazz FM called Peppermint Candy, which tonight comes to life at the Cobden Club. Amber and Nisha are your hostesses, laying on an evening of entertainment featuring a live show from electro-swing pioneers the Correspondents and big band Top Shelf Jazz, as well as Marawa the Amazing's astounding hula-hooping. There'll be complimentary cupcakes from the Hummingbird Bakery too \u2013 just the thing for keeping your energy levels up as you bop to DJ sets from Nick Hollywood, Paul Golledge and Mikyla of the She Set gang. Cobden Club, W10, Wed Leonie Cooper Badman Summer Ball, Manchester Listening back to the UK's dance underground of the early to mid-90s, the sense of fun in the music is startling and refreshing, even if the sounds may not be as refined as their modern-day equivalents. Perhaps it's nostalgia, a remembrance of smiley faces, limited breakbeat samples and piano lines, but even that era's scary hardcore records sound joyous and silly today. The UK's jungle movement of that period is similarly unique, as fresh and adventurous as dubstep was initially, and similarly went on to inform a wide swath of diverse musics, not least drum'n'bass, and its party scene has traded influence with sections of the UK reggae movement ever since. For some, music never got any better, and the chance to revel to the sounds of genuine jungle legends Ray Keith, Randall and Remarc on Friday should entice many to tonight's event.
