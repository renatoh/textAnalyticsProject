Gareth Patterson QC, representing six of the eight victims\u2019 families said it had been a mistake not to take such preventative action to avoid a recurrence of the attack on the Palace of Westminster on 22 March 2017. On 3 June, the same year, three attackers \u2013 Khuram Butt 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22 \u2013 using a similar modus operandi, mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in and around the Borough Market area. The inquest at the Old Bailey in London heard that, exactly a month before the London Bridge attack, Sergeant Matthew Hone, in an email to City of London police colleagues, wrote that the location was probably his \u201cbiggest concern\u201d in terms of an attack of low sophistication. The bridge had already been identified by the force as being in the top five of likely sites for an attack in the City of London. But Jane Gyford, who was the City of London police commander of operations and security at the time, said the location did not meet the criteria for installing barriers, namely a specific threat or large public event. Gyford told the inquest: \u201cThere was no intelligence picture to suggest London Bridge was going to be the site of an attack and therefore we were looking at the picture as a whole and we were taking action.\u201d She was challenged by Patterson, who said barriers would have been a prevention against attack in the way that unpredictable, highly visible deployments and armed vehicle response units, could not be. He said: \u201cThis particular place was crying out for protection was it not? My suggestion is that, whether [the decision-making process] was rigorous or not, the wrong decision was clearly made, and the unreasonable decision was made, not to install barriers.\u201d Gyford replied: \u201cI disagree.\u201d On Wednesday the inquest had heard from Lucy D\u2019Orsi, deputy assistant commissioner specialist operations at the Metropolitan police. She said that the Westminster assault had been considered a strike on parliament rather than a bridge attack. \u201cThe view was that the bridge was a road used by the terrorist [Khalid] Masood to carry out his attack on parliament,\u201d she said. Those killed by the London Bridge attackers were Christine Archibald, 30; S\u00e9bastien B\u00e9langer, 36; Kirsty Boden, 28; Ignacio Echeverr\u00eda Miralles De Imperial, 39; James McMullan, 32; Alexandre Pigeard, 26; Xavier Thomas, 45; and Sara Zelenak, 21. Another 48 people were injured, 19 of them critically. The inquest continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
