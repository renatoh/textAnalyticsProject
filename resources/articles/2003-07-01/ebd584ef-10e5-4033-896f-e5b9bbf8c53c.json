His Test career for Australia is long gone but in county cricket - he has also played for Essex and Leicestershire - he still stands tall. His first-innings five for 48 gave him a championship haul to date of 35 wickets at 26, and a hapless Hampshire followed on before 5pm. Glamorgan's first innings lasted a further seven balls in the morning, but by then they had 437 and are looking like a First Division side in waiting. If cricket had a Conference, however, Hampshire would be heading for it. With Robin Smith nursing an injured hamstring, John Crawley out of form and Simon Katich failing yesterday, their batting looks as brittle as their bowling is mild. Kasprowicz is 31 but shows no intention of slowing down, as the Hampshire opener Jimmy Adams was painfully reminded. He took his eyes off a lifter that broke his helmet grille and left a nasty cut behind his ear. Kasprowicz changed to come around the wicket and Adams was caught behind, waving a tentative bat. Katich soon followed, deflecting to third slip. Kasprowicz also had Nic Pothas lbw, Chris Tremlett fending off a throat ball to fourth slip, and when the tail-ender James Tomlinson showed an understandable reluctance to get behind the line he lost two stumps. Second time around Robert Croft was among the wickets, although Adams had the rare distinction of scoring an all-run five with Croft the toiling fielder trundling down to long-on. Only if the ground disappears under water can Hampshire be saved now, 138 behind and four careless wickets down. Meanwhile meetings are being held over the future of the fast bowler Ed Giddins, signed to Hampshire on a lucrative two-year contract. He has made only three championship appearances, and though he claims to be available, he is totally out of favour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
