And your favourite of all time? A panel of TV types - and one reviewer - were asked these very questions at the Question Time session at this weekend's Doc/Fest in Sheffield. Do you agree with their choices? What's your favourite documentary of the past year? James Walton, Daily Telegraph TV critic: Folk Britannia (BBC4) 'Really well written - authoritative but irreverent.' Peter Salmon, BBC Vision chief creative officer: Stephen Fry - The Secret Life Of The Manic Depressive (BBC2) 'Revealing and entertaining.' Richard Wolfe, Sky One director of programmes: Panorama's football bungs investigation (BBC1) 'Good to see Panorama getting a huge audience and the whole nation talking about it.' Roger Graef, Films of Record chief executive: Send Me Somewhere Special (BBC3) 'A Grierson best newcomer winner. A gem - unusual and fresh.' Angus Macqueen, Channel 4 head of documentaries: Sisters In Law (More4) What's your all time favourite documentary? JW: The World At War (ITV) 'Terrific - I saw it again recently and it still stands up.' PS: Michael Moore's Roger and Me RW: Desmond Wilcox's The Boy David (BBC) RG: Hello Do You Hear Me? (ITV/Channel 4) 'Yuri Podneik's film about glasnost in Latvia - not only brilliant, it will now be available to view on the internet.' AM: Pawel Pawlikowski's From Moscow To Pietushki (BBC) The Panel were also asked for their worst factual programme of the past year - but only James Walton ventured an answer: Channel Five's Alive, where a bunch of minor celebs, including Carole Caplin, were sent to the Andes to 'recreate' the incident where a group of air crash survivors were forced to eat their dead friends to survive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
