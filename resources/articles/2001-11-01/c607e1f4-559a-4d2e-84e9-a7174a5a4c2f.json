Two high court judges have overturned the decision by the inquiry tribunal, headed by Lord Saville, that all witnesses must appear in person. Although the high court decision is subject to appeal, it is thought highly unlikely that the tribunal will push its earlier insistence that the soldiers travel to Ireland. The issue is clouded in legal niceties, but the central issue is clear. The 36 military witnesses who brought the action believe that they could be targeted for reprisals. Unless today's judgment is overturned on appeal, the soldiers - between 200 and 400 of them in total - are likely to give their evidence in London, with a live video link to the Guildhall in Derry. They have already been guaranteed anonymity. Does this matter? It matters very much indeed to the people of Derry, especially those who lost loved ones on January 30, 1972. They want to look into the eyes of the paratroopers who opened fire that day, killing 13 men and boys. It is rather more important, however, that the truth finally be told. Whether it is spoken in the Guildhall, or transmitted via a video link from London, is a secondary issue. Relatives of the dead were scathing about this morning's court decision. They argued, with justice, that the Queen was in Derry only yesterday. If the monarch feels safe in the city, then why should former paratroopers be scared? The plain reason is that these are the most hated men - in nationalist and republican eyes - in Northern Ireland. They have been demonised for nearly 30 years. Their testimony to the Saville inquiry could last six months or more. Hearing the soldiers' version of Bloody Sunday is certain to inflame passions in Derry and encourage public demonstrations - or worse. Certainly, the soldiers would have to be given extraordinary security protection if they are obliged to give their evidence in person. That in turn could be a further brake on the lumbering progress of the inquiry. So far, it has heard around 380 of the 500 potential civilian witnesses. Then it will be the turn of politicians and officials. Only after they have all given evidence will the tribunal hear from military witnesses. The tribunal is expected to report late in 2003 or early 2004. Its final report, arguably the most important document of its kind in the history of the modern Troubles, is not expected to be issued before 2003, at the earliest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
