Until now, security experts have been unable to get blocked files or sites through the firewall. But scientists at Cambridge University's computer laboratories now say it is possible to break through by circumventing some of the system's detection procedures. The Chinese firewall operates by triggering the reset of any data packets that contain the government-listed keywords. By manipulating the procedure, clever users can get information through without much trouble. \"The machines in China allow data packets in and out, but send a burst of resets to shut connections if they spot particular keywords,\" said Richard Clayton, a professor of computing whose work has featured in Technology Guardian. \"If you drop all the reset packets at both ends of the connection - which is relatively trivial to do - the web page is transferred just fine.\" And, according to Professor Clayton, such tactics can also turn the firewall against itself. By inserting fake keyword information into ordinary files, even users with dial-up connections could trigger what amounts to a denial of service attack against the firewall itself. Such an attack would only block data between two points, but if done right could affect the entire network. Despite this breakthrough, however, things could get even tougher for Chinese internet users if recent press reports are true. At a conference in Beijing, Cai Wu, the director of the Information Office of the State Council, said he would look at developing systems that could regulate blogs, search engines and other technologies. The reason? \"Because more and more harmful information is being circulated online,\" he said. Developments under consideration include registration for websites and a database of mobile phone ownership, as officials try to keep track of who might be causing potential unrest. Mobile phones are a particular problem, with people able to buy them anonymously and keep in contact with each other outside the reach of Beijing. But the attack on the net doesn't stop there: Wu's announcement came on top of a fresh crackdown on internet cafes, which are being threatened with closure if they fail to enforce rules governing how much time children can spend online. China's relationship with the internet has been a difficult one. The nation boasts 110 million web users, but they are ruled by a government intent on controlling the flow of information. The struggle between the two is unlikely to be finished for some time. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
