Documents filed in a San Francisco court suggest at least some athletes coached by Korchemny will be called to appear in open court if the case goes to trial, including one unnamed athlete who has already admitted to investigators using anabolic steroids and human growth hormone allegedly supplied by Balco. The Ukrainian-born Korchemny is among four men accused of conspiring to distribute banned performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes. It is not believed that Chambers, who was last month banned for two years after testing positive for the designer steroid THG, is the athlete referred to in the documents. But it is known US investigators are keen to talk to him to discover the extent of his relationship with Korchemny and Victor Conte, the owner of Balco. The athlete in the court document, who will play a key role in the trial, allegedly met with Korchemny and Conte to discuss performance-enhancing drugs. The athlete told investigators about subsequently taking a drug Conte called \"The Clear\", a steroid later identified as THG."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
