Residents of the heritage-listed town, 125km south of Perth, have criticised the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) for failing to warn them that the fire front was coming on Thursday night, with some saying the only warning they received was an automated text about the Waroona fire, then about 20km to the north, on Wednesday. In a statement issued late on Monday, DFES said the first emergency alert explicitly mentioning Yarloop was issued at 7.35pm on Thursday. The fire hit the town at about 8pm. However, DFES said that three earlier alerts, the first issued at 8.25pm on Wednesday, the first day the fire was reported, included parts of the Yarloop townsite in its broader description of the fire area. That description was given by listing roads that served as a boundary to the area considered to be at risk. Maps accompanying DFES\u2019s statement show that by 5.55am on Thursday, most of the Yarloop townsite was included in the alert area \u2013 but that was stated only by listing the boundary roads, not by mentioning Yarloop by name. Emergency alerts are posted on the DFES website and social media channels, read out on ABC local radio, and issued to media outlets. The fire and emergency services commissioner, Wayne Gregson, earlier said he didn\u2019t know when the first warnings mentioning Yarloop were issued, but that would not have prevented residents in the town from knowing about the bushfire. \u201cIt is incomprehensible to me that people would say, well, I didn\u2019t know that there was a fire on my doorstep,\u201d he said. The statement from DFES repeated that theme of personal responsibility, saying: \u201cin the event of a bushfire, DFES advises all members of the community to stay aware of their surroundings and take appropriate and early action for their safety\u201d. \u201cLeading up to and at the time of impact, it can be confirmed that there were numerous fire appliances and earth-moving equipment within and around the townsite of Yarloop,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOver the four-day period [from Thursday to Sunday] the community was advised, every hour, to take action \u2013 either leave the area or be ready to actively defend their homes.\u201d DFES said the majority of the town\u2019s population of 540 decided to leave on Thursday, but about 150 remained behind. Many sheltered on the oval, protected by the fire trucks of local brigades. Firefighters who remained to help have said the fire took just 10 minutes to flatten the town, with 143 buildings, including 128 homes, destroyed. Two elderly male residents, 77-year-old Les Taylor and 73-year-old Malcolm Taylor, not believed to be related, died in the fire. David Phillips, a Yarloop resident who tried to save Les Taylor, has laid part of the blame on the lack of warnings, saying \u201cno one said anything about Yarloop\u201d. DFES said a decision was made not to send in police to door-knock the area, because \u201cit was deemed unsafe to send non-firefighting personnel into the Yarloop area on Thursday evening to individually direct remaining community members to evacuate.\u201d Police did door-knock houses in Harvey, 15km to the south, on Saturday, despite the order to evacuate being given on Friday. Authorities have also been criticised for the lack of water in Yarloop, which firefighters have said left them unable to defend properties. Scott Britza, a volunteer firefighter from Harvey fire and rescue service, told Fairfax Media his crew was left with just 500 litres of water to defend themselves and residents on the oval. Sue Murphy, chief executive of the Water Corporation, has confirmed that the feed-in supply to Yarloop\u2019s water tank was cut off at 7.26am on Thursday when the town lost power. Murphy said the tank was full at that time but couldn\u2019t be replenished. The town\u2019s fire hydrants remained operational. \u201cWater Corporation works closely with DFES in the event of a bushfire so that firefighters have the best access to available water supplies,\u201d she said. \u201cDespite these efforts, there will often be a total loss of water.\u201d The standing advice from DFES and the Water Corporation is that people planning to stay and defend their home in a bushfire should have an independent water supply and a fire pump that doesn\u2019t rely on mains electricity. The fire was stopped just 1km from the Harvey town boundary on Sunday and is currently behind containment lines, although Gregson warned that there were still pockets of fire along the fire\u2019s 232km perimetre which could flare up if weather conditions changed. That could happen as soon as Friday, with temperatures of 37C and dry thunderstorms forecast for the south-west. Murray Cowper, a Liberal MP whose state electorate includes the fire zone, said it could take months until the fire is extinguished and firefighters \u2013 both in managerial positions in DFES and volunteers \u2013 needed ongoing support. \u201cThey have been fighting for days on end. Now is not the time to be pointing fingers and playing the blame game, now is the time to pull together,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
