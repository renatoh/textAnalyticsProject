At 6am with Luna, our golden Labrador, licking my arm to get me moving. I take her out, grab a coffee and check my three daily morning emails: from the police, TFL and City Hall. Our Sunday luxury is getting the papers delivered (I was a paperboy myself), which I read after morning prayers. Sunday lunch? Dal and fresh rotis at Mum\u2019s. There\u2019s more than 30 of us; it\u2019s total chaos, four generations of siblings arguing. There\u2019s a rule in the Khan family: eat fast and speak fast, or you don\u2019t get fed or heard. Exercise? I\u2019ve been playing Sunday morning football in our local park with the same group of lads since 1994, and I try not to miss it. Kick off is 10am and we\u2019re done by midday. Through marriage, kids and a bereavement we\u2019ve kept it going. What\u2019s changed? I\u2019ve got close-protection officers with me at all times. They follow when I\u2019m jogging; sit at the next table if we\u2019re out for a meal. They even stand on the edge of the pitch during football \u2013 and give me feedback after the game. You get used to it, but I won\u2019t pretend it\u2019s normal. Do you work? I check my emails twice daily religiously, but I also bring home a few hours of weekend reading: ideas for speeches, briefings. And there are events: a remembrance service one week; celebrations for Diwali the next. Previous London mayors did three or four days a week. I work seven. Things are different during an election campaign. I\u2019m out and about supporting Labour\u2019s London candidates. How were Sundays as a kid? I don\u2019t mention it much, but Dad was a bus driver. He had a pass for free travel, so he\u2019d take Sundays off and we\u2019d head out across London. Dad\u2019s the reason I know the city so well. He believed in exploring. Worst habit? Letting the football results determine my Monday morning mood.
