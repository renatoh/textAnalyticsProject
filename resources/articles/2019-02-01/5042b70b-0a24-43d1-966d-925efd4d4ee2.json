Governor Gavin Newsom called the move \u201cpolitical retribution\u201d for the state\u2019s lawsuit against Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency, but California and Trump have been at it since before he was even elected president. California, which has styled itself as the Democratic-led \u201cresistance\u201d to the administration, has launched 46 lawsuits against the Trump administration since Trump was sworn in. Trump and his government have taken jabs at the most populous state in the nation whenever they could as well. Immigration has been at the forefront of this back-and-forth. Trump set his sights on California\u2019s stance on the issue while on the campaign trail, attacking the \u201csanctuary city\u201d and \u201csanctuary state\u201d laws that limit local law enforcement cooperation with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). The state has stood behind its policies and went on to challenge Trump\u2019s travel ban on Muslim-majority countries and his decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program. California later joined 17 other states in a lawsuit to force officials to reunite migrant families separated at the border. Agents for immigration and customs enforcement, however, have amped up enforcement, arresting hundreds in targeted raids in sanctuary cities. In March, the justice department sued California, accusing the state of interfering with the enforcement of immigration laws. Environmental standards have been a sore spot between California and the Trump administration as well, with the Environmental Protection Agency announcing in April that it would ease emissions standards for cars and trucks and revoke California\u2019s ability under the Clean Air Act to impose its own greenhouse gas standards. The state filed a lawsuit against the EPA in May. Negotiations between the state and the administration over the emissions standards fell apart on Wednesday, said Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the environment and public works committee. \u201cThis administration\u2019s negotiations with the state of California over fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards have been superficial and scant at best, or duplicitous and designed to fail at worst,\u201d Carper said. \u201cWhile I am deeply disappointed by today\u2019s confirmation by the administration that these negotiations are over, it\u2019s difficult for me to understand how that is the case if discussions never seriously began in the first place.\u201d In August, Trump blamed the state\u2019s \u201cbad environmental laws\u201d for the wildfires that burned up much of the state and killed dozens. His comments did not go over well, even when he visited the hard-hit town of Paradise, which he incorrectly referred to as \u201cPleasure.\u201d In a way, the latest announcement over the federal funding for the high-speed rail project can also be traced back to differing views on the environment. High-speed rail advocates had hoped that the multi-decade, $77bn endeavor connecting eight of the state\u2019s largest cities by the nation\u2019s first bullet train would finally solve the state\u2019s notorious traffic issue and lessen the subsequent air pollution created by stalled vehicles. When Newsom declared in his state of the state address that \u201cthe project, as currently planned, would cost too much and take too long\u201d, Trump took that as an indication that \u201cCalifornia has been forced to cancel the massive bullet train project after having spent and wasted many billions of dollars.\u201d He called it a \u201c\u2018green\u2019 disaster,\u201d to which Newsom responded, \u201cThe train is leaving the station \u2013 better get on board!\u201d His office later clarified that he only meant that \u201cwe have to be realistic about the project\u201d. A week later, the US Department of Transportation announced that it intended to cancel $929m in federal grant funds and \u201cis actively exploring every legal option to seek the return from California of $2.5bn in federal funds FRA (Federal Railroad Administration) previously granted\u201d. The announcement came after California filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the president\u2019s national emergency declaration \u2013 and hours after Trump tweeted, \u201cThe failed Fast Train project in California, where the cost overruns are becoming world record setting, is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed Wall!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that the administration\u2019s threat comes 24 hours after California led 16 states in challenging the president\u2019s farcical \u2018national emergency\u2019,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cThe president even tied the two issues together in a tweet this morning. This is clear political retribution by President Trump, and we won\u2019t sit idly by. This is California\u2019s money, and we are going to fight for it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
