But the News of the World initially spiked its story on Chris Huhne's relationship with his press adviser because he was \"not famous enough\", the former chief reporter has revealed. Neville Thurlbeck, writing on his personal blog, recounted how the NoW sat on the story of Huhne's infidelity for a year. It was only after the Lib Dem MP became energy secretary in the coalition government in May 2010 that the editor, Colin Myler, felt the story was worth running. Thurlbeck told how he hired a private investigator \u2013 Derek Webb (the so-called Silent Shadow) \u2013 to tail Huhne's lover, Carina Trimingham , from the MP's Eastleigh constituency to her London home. He said he was tipped off about the story when he ran into an old contact by chance during a visit to parliament on another kiss-and-tell job. That story, about former Labour MP Nigel Griffiths, originated via a tip-off from a teenager, Thurlbeck revealed. Thurlbeck also paid tribute to Isabel Oakeshott, the Sunday Times political editor who exposed Huhne's points swap. \"I tip my hat to her,\" he said. \"But it's odd to think all this unravelling and domino effect would never have happened if a nosy teenager in 2009 hadn't picked up the phone to me.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
