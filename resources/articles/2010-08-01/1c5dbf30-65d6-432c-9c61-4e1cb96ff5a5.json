Blake is one of Britain's truly great artists and it is inexplicable that, for the last year, Tate Britain has chosen to exhibit just two small paintings. We call for the reinstatement of a William Blake Room, so that a new generation has the chance to discover the glories of our greatest visionary artist. Helen Elwes and Stephen Micalef London \u2022 Jane Graham's survey of underage viewing of X-rated films (From the droogs to David Essex, Film &amp; Music, 13 August) brought back many memories. As a 13-year-old in 1961 I was desperate to see the apocalyptic shocker The Day the Earth Caught Fire. I had to beg my father to take me. He ruined my afternoon by asking for \"One and a half\". I saw the film years later \u2013 but the thrill had gone. Richard Heller London \u2022 When my brother died some years ago, included in his grave goods was a copy of the Guardian, rolled up, as usual, in his jacket pocket (Letters, 12 August). In the tough, Dublin council estate where he lived his copy had to be ordered in especially. The only time his name appeared in his beloved paper was in his death notice. But I'm sure he was still proud. Ter O'Neill, there it is again. Martin M O'Neill Sunderland \u2022 It's more than just a question of clapping (Editorial, 14 Aug). Last week at a Prom, a lady behind me complained at each outburst of applause. Then, when she recognised a theme in the Brahms symphony, she sang along with gusto. Jonathan Rennert London \u2022 With Philip Green looking at government spending (Report, 13 August), at least we know David Cameron was sincere when he said \"Vote Blue, go Green\". Kevin McGrath Harlow, Essex \u2022 I expect that, conscious of health trends in the 80s, Guy Smith's Mayfair bar (Letters, 14 August) also stocked the sugar-free version, Dart Cake.
