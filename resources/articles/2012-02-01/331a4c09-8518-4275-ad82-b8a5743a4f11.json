The Department of Health is deciding whether to cancel contracts paid to at least 25 staff via private firms worth over \u00a34m, or to wait for the outcome of the Treasury review at the end of March. The Guardian on Thursday reported that more than 25 staff employed by the department have salaries paid direct to private companies that they have set up. Many are listed as full-time legal, IT or human resources consultants. The department said many of them had been employed for a long time, and appear on staff directories. It also contended they were contractors, highlighting a disputed area of employment law. The arrangement can be tax-efficient both for the individual and for the Whitehall department, including arm's-length bodies, since the department may not need to pay national insurance in addition to fees. Treasury sources said it was necessary to see whether deals were beneficial to the taxpayer as a whole, taking into account overall lost tax income to government. They added that the review is looking at the wider morality of such public servants being paid in this way. The Guardian has been alerted to similar schemes operating in NHS trusts and primary care trusts. In one recent case, the Milton Keynes Hospital paid its acting chief executive Mark Millar via a partnership called Millar Management Associates. There is nothing illegal in staff being employed as consultants, especially if they are temporary. Jonathan Baume, head of the senior civil servants' union, the FDA, described the methods of payment to senior Whitehall staff as a \"shambles\", and called for an end to deals that were not transparent. He said: \"We need to get to the bottom of how widespread this is across Whitehall departments and in quangos,\" he said. There has also been concern about the scale of bonuses being offered. Baume explained said there had been a big push under the last Labour government to offer these deals in a bid to offer competitive rates in market facing areas. \"Because the market rate was so much greater than the salary that would have been offered in the civil service, various deals were being done, and some of these are now being exposed. \"We need to be very transparent, and very clear that this cannot continue, but at the same time grasp a very difficult political nettle, which is to address the problem of pay at the senior levels of the Civil Service.\" Some of the salaries being paid by the Department of Health would already be regarded as very large, including 19 payments over \u00a3100,000, of which 12 are over \u00a3150,000 and five over \u00a3250,000. The DH said some of these payments cover more than one year. Gareth Thomas, the shadow cabinet office minister, who had been told that no civil servants in the DH had their salaries paid to companies, was seeking clarification across Whitehall. He revealed that he was writing to every government department \"to check the accuracy of the answer to my parliamentary question about whether senior staff on their watch are paid through limited companies. It is a real concern that government departments have not given full and complete answers. Parliament needs ministers to give accurate answers so that MPs can ministers to account for policies.\" Chris Bryce, chief executive of PCG, the biggest organisation representing freelancers in the UK, said: \"The government is right to look closely at how public servants are being remunerated, and where there is disguised employment or tax evasion, it should be stopped and fully investigated by HMRC. However, it is fundamentally inaccurate to brand all one-person limited companies as employees attempting to avoid tax. We must ensure we do not create an orchestrated witch-hunt against the nation's smallest businesses that will damage public and private sector growth in the UK.\" A DH spokesperson said: \"The department is currently gathering data on the contracting arrangements of those working at senior level within the DH and in the NHS. The use of tax avoidance in the public sector is expressly forbidden and if found in our review, it will be dealt with. It is not the department's policy to employ people through companies in order for them to pay less tax, but some skills which the department does not possess or cannot recruit in-house do need to be bought in through contracts.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
