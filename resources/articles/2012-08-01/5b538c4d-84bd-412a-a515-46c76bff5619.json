The boat had been built for war service and played a crucial role in the D-Day landings. In 1980, when Sam was eight and his brother Jake was four, the Coles sold their house in Sussex and moved to the coast, and this \"giant playground\" of a home in Shoreham Harbour's houseboat community. Polly had to learn to cope with looking after two small boys on a draughty old boat, with all the washing and cooking that entailed. Within weeks, Jake had fallen into the water: \"One of those perfect cartoon moments, with two little feet sticking out of the river,\" she says. For Sam, \"It was like living on the set of Star Wars. I'd gone from a normal house to somewhere with doors that opened with submarine handles, and ladders and hatches everywhere. It was very exciting.\" Now 40, Sam has lived on land longer than he has lived on water but he is a frequent visitor to Shoreham-by-Sea, where his parents live on their second boat, Fische \u2013 a 150ft German minesweeper, they bought after Lunasea sank for the last time. Jake, 36, also lives on Fische, in a self-contained flat. Motor torpedo boats such as Lunasea were never intended to last, much less be lived in by a family of five. \"Jake and I used to joke that as teenagers we did more damage to it than the Germans,\" says Sam. Lunasea was blighted by cold and damp. In winter, it was so chilly that Sam used to set his alarm for an hour before he had to get up so he could turn on the gas heater before climbing out of bed. In later years, the Coles struggled to keep the boat afloat and often had to bale out water. Sometimes, there were emergencies. Once, Toby, now 29 and the youngest Cole, narrowly averted a sinking when he was at home by himself: \"It had got to the point where the switch that turned the pumps on and off was under water and had fused \u2026 if the tide had been a few inches higher, it would have come over the floorboards.\" And one Christmas Day ended with a visit from the fire brigade. \"We'd all piled back from the pub for a few more drinks and someone opened the door to leave and all this water rushed in. It was like a scene from Titanic.\" By then, Jake had decamped to a flat at the back of their neighbour's sturdier houseboat and when Lunasea fell into greater disrepair, Toby joined him. Lunasea started to sink on every tide and, after 23 years, Polly and Fred were forced to abandon ship too, moving in with the two boys next door. The family set about breaking up their former home. Toby was a student at Sussex University at the time: \"I'd get up at 7am, go to uni, come back, get my wellies on, saw up the boat for five or six hours and then go back to bed.\" The Coles had never planned to live on a boat permanently. They bought Lunasea as a cheaper alternative to a house. Polly says: \"Fred had started working with a guy who lived on a boat down here and we thought, 'Yeah, this will do for a while.'\" Did she have moments of doubt about what they had done? \"Frequently! I was working full-time when Lunasea was coming to an end and I'd be at work thinking, will this be the day I get the call to say our home's gone under?\" But living on water must be in their blood. Not long after the demise of Lunasea, Fred went to Southampton, telling Polly he was just \"going to have a look at something\". \"The next thing I remember was Mum phoning and saying, 'Your dad's gone mad and bought a minesweeper!'\" says Sam, laughing. The 150ft Fische carried a crew of 39 during the cold war when patrolling the Baltic Sea, so there was no shortage of space. She cost \u00a3800. Fred says he has always had an eye for a bargain, although it cost thousands to bring the boat to Shoreham, make it habitable \u2013 and then fight to keep it there. By no means everyone was as delighted at the warship's arrival as the Coles and there was a lengthy battle for planning permission. But with freehold moorings now going for upwards of \u00a3300,000 (the Coles paid \u00a31,186 in 1986), it is a risk that appears to have paid off. Both Sam and Toby would like to live on a boat again one day. \"There's a sense of community here that you don't tend to get on land,\" says Sam. \"I live on a big road of terraced houses, but there's not much interaction because you can be completely self-reliant. Here, if one of the ropes snapped in the middle of the night, there would be people coming to help immediately because they know they could be in the same situation next week.\" Toby bought his Victorian terraced house in Brighton because it reminded him of the boats he grew up on. \"Everything's wonky \u2013 the stairs aren't straight and the floors are warped. It felt like home immediately.\" They agree that their unusual upbringing has shaped their lives, from the small things \u2013 Toby fronts a \"rum and bass\" outfit called the 55th Flotilla in honour of Lunasea \u2013 to the more fundamental. \"I think it's made us more laidback,\" says Sam. \"At home, my wife will worry about things not matching, or the walls being the wrong colour. I tend to think, 'It's not sinking \u2013 it's fine.'\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
