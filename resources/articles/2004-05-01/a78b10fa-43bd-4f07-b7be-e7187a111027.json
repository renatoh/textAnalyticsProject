And I hate everything about it, from its prolier-than-thou setting (a burger bar in a package-holiday resort), to Skinner's gormless rap-mumbling, to the moronically spritely chorus. I hate it because, despite having \"novelty record\" written all over it - think Splodgenessabounds' Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps with a UK garage flava - it has been greeted as a work of genius. Furthermore, its parent album, A Grand Don't Come for Free, isn't just genius, it's a downright \"masterpiece\" - or, in Q magazine's Pseuds' Cornerish opinion, \"a spoken-word opera... the best album of 2004 so far\". So what makes this bunch of operatic arias so laudable? Well, nothing. It's just that the pop establishment - middle-class guiltniks that we are - automatically grovels at the feet of anything purporting to be the voice of urban, working class yoof. It matters not, apparently, that Skinner comes across as dim and downtrodden as anything dreamt up in an EastEnders scriptwriters' meeting. Why are we meant to celebrate his supposed lifestyle, which, as depicted on his debut album Original Pirate Material, is an aimless round of late-night kebabs, spliffs and untaxed Ford Cortinas? These are exactly the sort of \"life options\" Welsh comedy-rappers Goldie Lookin' Chain make merciless fun of. It transpires, unsurprisingly, that Skinner spent his Birmingham adolescence not in a tower block but in a comfy house - just as that other prime offender Tim Westwood spent his in well-heeled Suffolk. Genuinely working class artists decamp to big piles in the country as soon as they receive their first royalty cheque - not the other way round. Don't believe the Street hype.

As a New York Dolls fan, then, he will be aware of their Spinal Tap-esque propensity for killing off drummers (Billy Murcia died in 1972; his replacement, Jerry Nolan, in 1990). If he doesn't survive the experience, it will be a hell of a way to go.

Because they're saddled with stupid names, obviously.
