Going to the mountains only amplifies that feeling, which is why the mental benefits of skiing, among other mountain activities, are becoming ever more widely appreciated. I\u2019ve been a freelance writer for 10 years, and have been all too aware how important regular ski trips are for my mental wellbeing \u2013 breaking up the monotony of long days working alone from home with just my dog for company. In the mountains, where the air is clear, the scenery mesmerising and the atmosphere jovial, I feel lighter, happier and more able to put my worries in perspective. Research appears to be on my side. A study published in 2019 by the Department of Sport Science at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, showed that skiing and being in the mountains seems to be tremendous for both our physical and mental health. Skiers described how they experienced \u201cpleasure, freedom, nature \u2026 and [the benefit of] social interactions\u201d. Beyond the physical benefits, exposure to the natural surroundings of the mountains during exercise appears to provide an additional boost to our psychological wellbeing and stress recovery. In recent years, as we\u2019ve realised the growing need to nurture our mental wellbeing, many of us have come to recognise that there is more to a skiing holiday than simply rushing down slopes all day and partying hard all night. Nowadays, we\u2019re more likely to stand and stare \u2013 taking time to appreciate the sheer wonder of the wintry mountains and the uplifting effect of such beauty on our mood. When it comes to physical health, there are myriad options to help you stay fit, over and above taking to the piste. Just being at altitude will fast-track your wellbeing and resorts have worked hard on installing such facilities as walking paths as well as offering more rigorous outdoor pursuits, not least ice climbing, ice-skating, ski touring, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, paragliding and fat-biking \u2013 there\u2019s lots on offer in Italy\u2019s Passo Tonale, for example. Louise Johnson, from Hampshire, skis twice a year with her partner, Mark, and various friends and family. She says: \u201cStanding at the top of the mountain, skis on, eyes fixed over a snow-capped range puts the world into perspective and it makes me realise how small humans are. In the mountains, I feel completely free. My mind forgets the daily troubles and focuses on the sound of the skis carving through fresh snow \u2013 one of the best sounds there is.\u201d Business owner Tom Clary, a father of two, escapes to the mountains for a couple of long weekends a year and says it is the \u201cperfect antidote to work\u201d. \u201cIt is like a reset when you get on the slopes on the Saturday morning,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is also a complete freedom from the responsibility of being a father and business owner. I particularly value being able to reconnect with friends, away from the rush and pressures of everyday life.\u201d Then \u2013 as I\u2019ve recently discovered after 30 years of skiing \u2013 there\u2019s the total departure from skiing to simply enjoy the benefits of being in a winter wonderland. We all relish some downtime and a chance to explore our playful side and indulge our inner child (as well as spoiling the family), which is why winter trips to Lapland have become a firm favourite in recent years. You can just soak up the ambience of snowy surrounds, blazing fires, reindeer and husky sled rides and even go ice fishing (as offered by Crystal Ski Holidays). Mother of four Freya Woodhall sees at first-hand the mental benefits of a ski holiday for the family. The outdoor-loving Woodhalls head to the mountains in summer and in winter to walk, mountain bike, ski and spend time together \u2013 away from their smartphones. \u201cThe greatest gift we can give our kids are happy, adventurous memories,\u201d says Freya, who met her husband, Ross, while working in the Alps. \u201cAs a family we find the mountains make us feel alive and inspired, taking in the views and each other\u2019s company while doing a sport we all enjoy. It\u2019s good for the soul. That\u2019s why we keep going back.\u201d Hit the slopes Book your space on the slopes at crystalski.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false}}}
