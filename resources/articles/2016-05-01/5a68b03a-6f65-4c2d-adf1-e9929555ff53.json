The Stadium of Light bursts with relief and celebration! Sunderland are deserved winners tonight, and on the basis of their late-season form, deserved Premier League survivors! They\u2019ve sent Norwich City and, of all teams, Newcastle United down to the Championship with Aston Villa! A big smile plays across Sam Allardyce\u2019s face. One can only wonder why. \u201cThis is really nice, it\u2019s like winning a title,\u201d smiles Jan Kirchhoff. Congratulations to the Black Cats, and commiserations to Newcastle and Norwich, who will be feeling heartbroken tonight. 90 min +5: Mirallas chips over Mannone from the edge of the box, but the ball bounces wide left. Just. Everton have been awful tonight, but they could have had two or three in added time! 90 min +4: Everton\u2019s evening of woe continues. First Mirallas sends a shot towards the top right from the edge of the box. Mannone tips it round for a corner, a wonder save. And from the set piece, the ball falls to the feet of Lukaku, six yards out, but he twangs the crossbar like a bass guitar. E, the lowest, most satisfying note. 90 min +3: ... Osman sends a free close-range header inexplicably wide left. It would have been a consolation Everton\u2019s overall performance doesn\u2019t deserve. 90 min +2: Space for Mirallas down the right. He earns a corner, from which ... 90 min +1: There will be five added minutes as a result of goal celebrations, substitutions, and tanked-up punters roaring around the place with their junk out. The first sees Lukaku have a pop from distance, but no dice. 90 min: Defoe goes skittering after a long hoof down the left. He enters the box, and should probably feed Watmore, free on his left, but drops a shoulder and has a go himself. Defoe tries to nutmeg Robles at his near post, which normally would qualify as beyond-the-pale cheek against a Premier League professional, but, well, y\u2019know. 89 min: \u201cI live over a mile away from the Stadium of Light,\u201d begins David Inglesby\u2019s report. \u201cThe noise in the house from there is deafening!\u201d And no wonder. Their team have been, to a man, brilliant tonight. An exceptional performance. 87 min: Not much going on now. The Sunderland fans entertain themselves by serenading Newcastle United. \u201cI hope the West Ham fans don\u2019t crash the internet with their congratulations to Big Sam,\u201d writes Steve Goldsmith. It\u2019s a love-in, this, all right. 85 min: ... and then Watmore comes on for Khazri. A warm round of applause for Khazri, who has been energetic and entertaining tonight. 84 min: It\u2019s time for a couple of curtain calls. Cleverley is replaced by Osman... 82 min: A lull as some tanked-up punter roars around the field with his junk out. Perhaps. They\u2019re not showing his act on TV, so he could be up to anything. 80 min: Pennington, out on the left, sends a safe cross out of play, miles to the right of the Sunderland goal. No blue shirts nearby, no danger. Sunderland fans will be counting no chickens yet. But having said that, the tension has eased to the point where Everton are cat-called mercilessly for the all-round low quality of that attack. 78 min: Sam Allardyce is taking no chances, despite the 3-0 scoreline and Everton\u2019s flaccid impotence. Cattermole, on a booking, is hooked in favour of John O\u2019Shea. He hands over the captain\u2019s armband as he departs. 77 min: Lennon and Barry combine down the right to release Cleverley into the area. The midfielder should shoot, but dallies, attempts a pointless one-two with Lukaku, and sees his eventual attempt for goal squirt off to the left. A corner, which is wasted. 75 min: Khazri, on the the left-hand corner of the Everton box, loops a gorgeous cross to Van Aanholt, bombing in from the right. The full back shapes to sidefoot back across for Defoe, who would have a close-range tap-in, but takes his eye off the ball and doesn\u2019t connect. Goal kick. That would have been an aesthetic delight. 73 min: And now a revived Lukaku glides in from the right and attempts a curler towards the top left. The ball breaks off Kone\u2019s back and out for a corner. From the set piece, Barry heads goalwards from the left-hand corner of the six-yard box, but it\u2019s straight at Mannone, who handles well. Everton have perked up a bit, which is the very least they could do. For large chunks of this match, they\u2019ve been a limp embarrassment to a famous old club. 71 min: Baines loops a ball down the inside-left channel for Lukaku, who works a little bit of space for a shot by the corner of the D. It\u2019s blocked immediately. 70 min: Kirchhoff is replaced by Sebastian Larsson. The substitution eats up a lot of the clock, a masterclass in professional time management. A dispirited Everton are unlikely to complain too much. They\u2019ll just want this to end too. 68 min: Cattermole is booked for a slide on Lennon, 30 yards out. Mirallas sends a free kick towards Funes Mori, on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. The defender should score, but clanks his header straight at Mannone, who turns the ball round the post for a corner. From the set piece, Baines sends a weak daisycutter straight at Mannone from distance. A little bit of much-missed passion from Everton, though it\u2019s all far too late. 66 min: Van Aanholt charges down the left wing. He slips a pass inside for Defoe, on the edge of the box, to the left of the D. The ball gets caught up between Defoe\u2019s feet, but the striker sorts himself out in double-quick time and fires a no-backlift buzzer towards the top left. Robles for once does the professional thing and parries clear. 64 min: Mind you, that shouldn\u2019t take away from Sunderland\u2019s whirlwind brilliance tonight. They\u2019ve been wonderful in attack, and the defence has come up trumps on the rare occasions they\u2019ve been called into action. Baines swings a free kick into the area from the left, and it\u2019s headed clear with purpose by Kaboul. 62 min: Lennon tries to combine with Lukaku down the right, but the striker\u2019s lazy ball inside to absolutely nobody brings a rare Everton attack to an embarrassing end. Roberto Martinez is on very shaky ground now. It\u2019s one thing losing the head in a Merseyside derby, or being outplayed by the new Premier League champions. But they\u2019re getting bossed, comprehensively, by a team who have only just avoided relegation. 60 min: Defoe breaks into the Everton box down the left, but faffs around and falls over, allowing Funes Mori to wander off with the ball. It\u2019s a party atmosphere in the Stadium of Light, and Everton don\u2019t appear equipped to poop it. 58 min: Everton are in tatters. First Defoe very nearly breaks clear again down the right. He\u2019s denied, but soon enough Khazri is bombing down the left, clear, one on one with the keeper. He unselfishly slides the ball right to Defoe, but plays the ball into the backtracking Funes Mori, who hacks out for a corner that leads to nothing. Meanwhile it\u2019s 4-2 to poor Norwich, who have located the team\u2019s bag of scoring boots far too late. Khazri very nearly sends a curling corner into the top left. Robles punch-flaps the ball off the line, but only into the back of McCarthy, standing just in front of the post. The ball breaks to Kone in the middle, and he batters home from a couple of yards. What a goalkeeping display this is. What a farce Everton\u2019s defence is. But hats off to Sunderland, who are grabbing their chance of Premier League safety with both hands! 54 min: Everton have hit the 70% possession mark again, enjoying the lion\u2019s share at the start of the half. Much good it looks like doing them, as Yedlin springs Defoe clear down the inside-right channel with a simple long ball. Defoe lobs the outrushing Robles, only for Pennington to hook clear off the line. Corner on the left, from which ... 51 min: Stones over-elaborates in the middle of his own half and very nearly allows Defoe to race off with the ball. He\u2019s still got a fair bit to learn, hasn\u2019t he. Meanwhile at the exercise in futility being played out at Carrow Road, Watford have pulled a goal back: it\u2019s now only 3-2 to Norwich, Odion Ighalo with the latest there. 49 min: A Khazri free kick from the right is eyebrowed across the face of goal by Barry and out for a corner on the left. Khazri takes that set piece too, and his corner finds the head of Kirchhoff, six yards out. Kirchhoff should score, but his weak header flashes wide right of goal. There\u2019s no sense that this game will end 2-0. None whatsoever. Sunderland would take it now, of course, with both hands. It\u2019ll still be a long 41 minutes plus stoppages. 47 min: Kaboul is penalised for nipping away at Lukaku\u2019s heels as the pair contest a ball down the Everton inside-right channel. The resulting free kick is hooked towards the left-hand post, where Barry heads back for Pennington, who tries to steer a header into the top left. It\u2019s not a bad effort, the young man battling in the middle of a packed box, but there\u2019s not enough steam behind it, and Mannone plucks it from the sky. To the dispassionate neutral, given the mental fragility of Everton right now, this relegation battle looks all over. But it\u2019s never quite that simple, is it. \u201cYou said Sunderland are 45 competent minutes from survival,\u201d begins Austin Baird, \u201cbut to all Sunderland fans that brings a wry smile to our lips. We all know: if anybody can screw this up it\u2019ll be Sunderland. Been there, done that.\u201d Fair point, well made. It\u2019ll be a long 45 minutes, then, one way or another. Here we go! Sunderland get the ball rolling for the second half; Everton have replaced Barkley with Lennon. Half-time reading: Oh Joel! And that\u2019s that for the first half. Unless something very strange happens to both Sunderland and Everton in the second half, the Black Cats are staying up! It\u2019s the worst possible news for Newcastle United and Norwich City, the latter now 3-1 up at home to Watford. Van Aanholt punches the air as he makes his way to the changing room; you can be sure Sam Allardyce will tell him that the job\u2019s not yet done. But it is half done. Sunderland are 45 competent minutes from survival! 44 min: Passionate brilliance from Sunderland there. \u201cAre you watching, Newcastle?\u201d the crowd ask the supporters of Allardyce\u2019s former club. Meanwhile, even by Everton\u2019s recent standards, this is a lame capitulation. Khazri\u2019s free kick, high from the right, finds the head of Defoe, who flashes a header towards the top right. Robles goes some way to atoning for his horrendous error by fingertipping over the bar. But it\u2019s all in vain. At the corner, there\u2019s some head tennis. Baines looks to have cleared Everton\u2019s lines, but the ball\u2019s returned by M\u2019Vila down the inside-left channel. Stones is deep, playing Kone onside, and the defender roofs a shot into the net from close range. Premier League survival is tangible now! The Stadium of Light is rocking! 40 min: Everton are suddenly rocking. Yedlin and Borini combine down the right, but the latter can\u2019t find Defoe in the box with his low cross. A second phase of attack down the same flank sees Mirallas clatter Borini from behind. Free kick. From which... Cattermole feeds Defoe down the middle. Defoe takes a touch, left to right, and is upended by Funes Mori. A free kick, 25 yards out, level with the right-hand post. Van Aanholt takes, and ... this is absurd! Van Aanholt hits a fairly tame low free kick to the left of the wall. Robles jumps behind the wall, and lets the ball nestle into the left-hand side of the net! Appalling goalkeeping, but Sunderland won\u2019t care! As things stand, they\u2019re staying up, and they\u2019re sending Newcastle United down with Norwich! 36 min: And again! This time it\u2019s McCarthy looping a ball down the inside-right channel. Lukaku looks to have the power to burst past Kaboul, but Mannone comes out of his area again to clear. It\u2019s a risky business, this. 34 min: Lukaku very nearly spins round Van Aanholt as the ball flies down the right wing. Fortunately for Sunderland, the full back sticks to his man like glue. Had he been given the slip, Lukaku would be running clear on goal. The crowd are beginning to get a little anxious, even though this sort of stuff is happening halfway up the pitch. Sunderland are taking risks with this high line. 33 min: Mirallas, having switched wings, embarks on a high-paced solo skitter down the left. He eventually runs out of room, but only after being swarmed by three red-and-white shirts. For a second, he threatened to break clear into a lot of space. Sunderland hearts were in mouths. But then, the nervous tension is such right now that it doesn\u2019t take much. 31 min: Van Aanholt is down getting a little treatment on his knee, having been accidentally clattered in a 50-50 with Pennington. He\u2019s limping a bit when he gets up, but in that manner which suggests everything will be OK. 29 min: Everton, having been quiet for a few minutes, have sprung back into life. Now Barkley makes himself a little time out on the left, cutting inside and curling a dangerous ball towards the far post. He\u2019s expecting Lukaku to be making a powerful run, but the big man isn\u2019t doing that. The ball squeaks out to the right of the goal, Mannone waving his arms in the nonchalant fashion, always in control, honest. 28 min: Cleverley, in the centre circle, scoops a pass down the middle that very nearly releases Mirallas clear on goal. The Everton winger is denied by Mannone, who scampers from his area and lashes the ball clear. A lovely pass, though. 26 min: A lot of aimless hoofing, representing something of a lull. 24 min: Kaboul, of all people, turns into Garrincha. He twists and turns down the left wing, then steps inside the Everton area and, faced with a tight angle, rips a high-paced curler across Robles and towards the top right. It flies inches wide, an excellent effort. The keeper was beaten all ends up. That would have been a beauty. 23 min: Sunderland are beginning to play Everton at their own game: they\u2019ve turned around the possession stats, having enjoyed 60% of the ball in the last five minutes. Everton are beginning to sit very deep. \u201cSunderland may be nervous,\u201d begins Lou Roper, \u201cbut what has Everton\u2019s excuse been? Mr Martinez seems a pleasant and knowledgeable fellow but the performances of his team have been shambolic. With whom to replace him, though? Rafa Benitez: predicting a) Newcastle will go down and b) he won\u2019t be keen on \u2018the Championship\u2019 (TM Lord Mawhinney).\u201d 21 min: Van Aanholt has a bit of space down the left, but decides to blooter the ball into the stand behind the goal. In the dugout, Sam Allardyce slumps back in his seat, pleasure very much an alien concept right now. 20 min: It\u2019s on a rolling boil at Carrow Road, though. Dieumerci Mbokani has made it 2-1 to Norwich! So safety is still a possibility as things stand. A few more twists and turns await us tonight, I\u2019ll be bound. 19 min: Sunderland finally get something going up front. Borini has a snapshot from the edge of the D that\u2019s closed down. Khazri tries to burst into the box down the left, but can\u2019t get an effort away. Yedlin earns a corner on the right, from which Kaboul sends a fairly harmless header straight at Robles. It\u2019s hotting up nicely. 17 min: It\u2019s all happening, Danny Boon style, at Carrow Road, where Nathan Redmond has equalised for Norwich. They\u2019re still going down, as they need a win, but this is where we all area. Meanwhile back on Wearside, Lukaku cuts in from the Everton right but can\u2019t quite work space to shoot as he enters the box. Kaboul and Van Aanholt usher him away. 15 min: A bit of head tennis outside the Everton area. Something for the home fans to get excited about. It all comes to naught, and then Khazri slides in recklessly on Barry. He\u2019s the second Sunderland player fortunate to escape a booking. 13 min: Troy Deeney has scored for Watford at Norwich, who are going down as things stand. Meanwhile at the Stadium of Light, Funes Mori plays a hospital pass back to his keeper. Robles does extremely well to hack clear under extreme pressure from the sliding Defoe. Funes Mori still in Liability Mode after his inexplicable Anfield meltdown, it would seem. 11 min: More Evertonian possession. They\u2019ve had 70% of it so far. A lot of whistling as accompaniment. Sunderland can\u2019t get out of their final third, with Everton stroking it around this way and that. But the home team are holding firm in the middle, and Everton can\u2019t work an opening. 9 min: Barry, deep on the left, swings a diagonal ball into the box. The young defender Pennington, haring down the right wing and making it into the area, rises to guide a header towards the top left from 12 yards. It\u2019s not a bad effort, if a touch high and wide. Not a million miles away, and for a nanosecond it caused Mannone to turn round and check the flight in concern. Had that been on target, it may well have beaten the keeper. It would have been some header, mind. 7 min: Borini, tight on the right, plays a lovely threaded ball inside for Defoe, who in turn attempts to release Van Aanholt down the left with a diagonal chip. Defoe doesn\u2019t quite get his angles correct, and the chance to spring Everton\u2019s back line on the left wing is gone. But that\u2019s the first bit of proper football from Sunderland tonight. 6 min: Everton are enjoying quite a lot of the ball, but doing very little with it. Plus \u00e7a change, some Goodison regulars will sigh. Sunderland meanwhile are looking a little edgy. Early days for everyone. 4 min: Cattermole comes straight through the back of Barkley in the centre circle. He should be booked for that, but the referee is in lenient mood. The notoriously hot-headed Sunderland midfielder will need to simmer down. 3 min: Yedlin and Khazri attempt to combine down the right wing, but the ball\u2019s never in anybody\u2019s total control. Sunderland have yet to settle. They\u2019re looking understandably hectic. Maybe it\u2019s nerves. 2 min: Barkley, in the centre circle, plays a first-time pass down the inside-right channel with a view to releasing Mirallas on goal. The flag goes up for offside. It\u2019s the correct decision, just, though Sunderland were playing a dangerous game with their high line: there really wasn\u2019t much in that. Mirallas would have been clear on goal. To the sound of a tumultuous roar, Everton get the ball rolling. The home fans belt out a cry of \u201cWe are staying up.\u201d The visitors play the ball back towards their own box. Funes Mori attempts to thread a pass up the left wing for Cleverley, but knocks it out of play. Sunderland are pressing hard, in the modern style. The teams are out! Sunderland in their famous red and white stripes, Everton wearing their equally storied blue. It\u2019s a belting atmosphere at the Stadium of Light, as you\u2019d expect for such a big game. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! Sam Allardyce speaks! \u201cWe hope to get it done tonight. It\u2019s a huge game, we\u2019ve put ourselves in a position after our tremendous comeback against Chelsea. But we won\u2019t take anything for granted against anyone. We have a lot of good attacking players, we can attack with flair and cause problems, but our defending will have to be better than it was on Saturday. If we can expose their weaknesses, as we saw Leicester do at the weekend, we\u2019ll get a chance to win. The players must hit their best form, the same level of performance as they did on Saturday. Everton are slightly wounded with the criticism they\u2019ve received, so I think they\u2019ll come out determined to show what they can do. We\u2019ll have to be on top form to beat them tonight. I haven\u2019t started thinking about survival. If I start doing that, you never know what\u2019s going to turn your way. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019ll be a great night. Let\u2019s do all we possibly can.\u201d Roberto Martinez speaks! \u201cWe always react well. We all know what Sunderland are playing for, but every point matters for the final position in the league table, and our approach matters. We have to start really well. The game will be played at a real tempo, with the home crowd playing a large part in their victory against Chelsea. Gareth Barry\u2019s experience and know-how is important. Funes Mori gives us good balance at the back. It\u2019s important to have fresh legs and fresh minds.\u201d He doesn\u2019t look particularly happy, the poor chap. A defeated look in the eyes. Tired. Running on fumes. It could be a big week at Goodison if these final two matches don\u2019t go well. A word on Norwich, who host Watford tonight. They need to beat the Hornets at Carrow Road this evening to have any chance of surviving. Not an impossible task, you\u2019d have thought, seeing their mid-table opponents will already have dug the fluffiest beach towels out of the cupboard in giddy anticipation. However, City have failed to score in their last four games, losing the lot, so good luck with that. \u201cTonight is really important, we want to make sure we take it to the last day,\u201d says Alex Neil. \u201cHopefully Everton can do us a turn, and get us a result as well.\u201d Just to clarify: if Norwich fail to win, they\u2019re down whatever Sunderland do tonight. If they\u2019re to stay up, they\u2019ll need to beat Everton on Sunday as well, while hoping Sunderland only gain a maximum of one point from Everton tonight and Watford on Sunday. (Let\u2019s assume Norwich won\u2019t make up a goal-difference deficit of ten.) A lot of Everton and Watford action in there, making for confusing reading. Thankfully you already know what\u2019s going on, or I\u2019d be in a whole world of trouble. Forget I brought the subject up. Sunderland\u2019s MO, then, well established through the years, is to faff around in the drop zone for the majority of the season before clambering out just before the day of reckoning. This week\u2019s Knowledge reports on the yin to their yang: the clubs who manage to stay out of the relegation places all season, only to haplessly drop into them at the very last minute. Oops! Chelsea might have been something of a shower this season, by their own lofty standards, but whichever way you spin it, they were the defending champions. And at the weekend, Sunderland came from behind, at a point when things began to look very dark indeed, to beat them rather gloriously. No changes to the team, then. Everton definitely have shower-related issues right now, to the point where a fair old chunk of the support wants shot of Roberto Martinez. Two matches to save his job? Possibly. With a desperate battle in mind, the manager recalls Ramiro Funes Mori and Gareth Barry, who are back from suspension and injury respectively. The pair take the places of Bryan Oviedo and Aaron Lennon, who started the dismal defeat at the new champs Leicester City. Kevin Mirallas is also back in the starting XI, at the expense of the currently misfiring \u00a313.5m striker Oumar Niasse. Sunderland: Mannone, Yedlin, Kone, Kaboul, Van Aanholt, Kirchhoff, Borini, Cattermole, M\u2019Vila, Khazri, Defoe. Subs: Jones, Larsson, Rodwell, N\u2019Doye, Pickford, O\u2019Shea, Watmore. Everton: Robles, Stones, Pennington, Funes Mori, Baines, McCarthy, Barry, Mirallas, Barkley, Cleverley, Lukaku. Subs: Gibson, Oviedo, Lennon, Niasse, Besic, Osman, Howard. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). It\u2019s easy to forget just how much bother Sunderland were in. At the end of 2015, having been defeated five times in a row, the Black Cats were in a black funk. They were second from bottom in the Premier League table, just four points ahead of a risible Aston Villa, five shy of neighbours Newcastle United, and seven short of safety. This time, surely, they were for the off. Ah, but give Sam Allardyce time to do his thing. The subsequent turnaround hasn\u2019t been spectacular, but it has been steady. Allardyce has transformed Sunderland from serial losers into a team who are hard to beat. Since the start of February, when they were extremely unfortunate to lose at home to Manchester City, the Mackems have only tasted defeat twice. And one of those matches was against Leicester City, who have been the boss of absolutely everyone. It\u2019s been an admirable sequence. Their results approaching the crunch have been particularly impressive. A 3-0 skelping of relegation rivals Norwich City. A sturdy draw at home against Arsenal. A last-minute equaliser at Stoke to salvage another precious point. And an effervescent comeback victory against the outgoing champions Chelsea. At exactly the right time, they took Premier League destiny into their own hands. A win here tonight against an increasingly abysmal Everton - last November and the Toffees\u2019 6-2 win at Goodison seems an awfully long time ago now - and they\u2019ll be safe. Going down with the Villa: Norwich and - dreamtime on Wearside - Newcastle. Should they fail to get the job done tonight, they\u2019ll get a second chance on Sunday in the final game of the season. That game\u2019s at Watford, who are safe and snug in mid-table, with the metaphorical cigar on, the symbolic feet on the illustrative desk, the allegorical beachtowels spread out on the connotative sun lounger. But tonight\u2019s the night, and Sunderland will be looking to seize the moment against a side who have only won once in their last nine matches, losing five of them, frequently in pitiful circumstances. Yet another successful Sunderland relegation escape is within one final bodyswerve of completion. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 7.45pm BST."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
