He downplays the intellectual and organisational capacity of the elected party activists, trade unionists and affiliates that make up the NPF. This process has developed the previous two manifestos - manifestos that delivered historic victories for Labour. Contrast this with the 1983 manifesto - \"the longest suicide note in history\" - written when Roy was a leading light in the party. The policy forum process has delivered. For example, activists on the NPF have been calling for schools to be open for longer, offering breakfast and after-school childcare, as well as making their facilities open to the wider community. Charles Clarke announced just such a proposal for extended schools in his five-year strategy. The Department of Health's plans focus on tackling health inequalities. Again, this draws directly on work of the party's policy commission. While the NPF may not be perfect, it is light years ahead of policy-making in Roy's time as deputy leader. But I am determined to make it better - which is why I have instigated a review. I look forward to reading Roy's suggestions on improving the NPF. I note also Roy's dismissive comments about choice. My own opinion on this has not changed since I read a compelling piece on the subject back in 1987. That piece made clear that \"socialists attempt to organise society in a way which allows increasing numbers of men and women to make ... choices for them selves\". Its author was Roy Hattersley. I agreed with him then, I still agree with that point and I wonder why Roy has changed his mind. Ian McCartney MP Chair of the Labour party and the national policy forum Roy Hattersley's assessment of the NPF is widely shared by our members. Its standing could be enhanced by a leadership commitment to re-establishing democracy in the party, as in Iraq. As a first step to rebuilding trust between leader and members and the wider community, the party could publish the names and contact details of delegates to the NPF, together with the attendance register at the July meeting, its proceedings and votes.
