Morris\u2019s name was on the warrant, along with reporters Dan Oakes and Sam Clark, and it was a day of high drama, but at least the spotlight had moved off an internal dispute. On Monday Guardian Australia and Media Watch reported that Morris took a phone call from Adani spokeswoman Kate Campbell about a damaging story which was later spiked. On Tuesday ABC journalists condemned the alleged editorial interference by the resources company and called on Morris to explain why the radio story by Isabel Roe was not run on Saturday AM, but Morris was in Canberra on Tuesday and the raids on Wednesday delayed the showdown. Morris finally met staff representatives in person and via a national phone hook-up on Thursday. Sources say he insisted he had nothing to do with pulling the story and that he merely passed on the message from Adani that the company believed it had not been given enough time to respond. The meeting was tense \u2013 one journalist described it as \u201cugly\u201d \u2013 and Morris was challenged on what some reporters see as a cultural problem with the newsroom. Staff feel the normal complaints system is sometimes being circumvented by angry people going straight to the top to complain, which is what happened in the Adani case. This fear of upsetting powerful entities also leads to self-censorship, an issue which was raised by the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance in a submission to the political interference inquiry. Morris told them all they had to do was speak up if they felt their stories were being silenced. An email that went out to all staff after the meeting rubbed salt into the wounds. The ABC\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, said the decision to drop the story was made independently by the program\u2019s executive producer. \u201cGaven gave no instruction or direction to anyone to spike the Adani story,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThe ABC will continue to provide frank and fearless coverage of the Adani story just as it does on other matters of importance to Australians. \u201cI have complete confidence in the editorial integrity and leadership of Gaven Morris.\u201d So why did the producer spike the commissioned story? Anderson said it was \u201cbecause he had too much content for his show and felt the piece, based on a days old article by a Bloomberg journalist days before, didn\u2019t advance the story sufficiently\u201d. In other words, it was the fault of the reporter for not producing a strong enough story with a fresh angle. Nothing to do with a call from a corporate flack. The response has not gone down well. Race to the bottom Tim Blair doesn\u2019t get anywhere near as much attention as the Herald Sun\u2019s Andrew Bolt, but the Daily Telegraph commentator posts some deplorable content on his blog. When he\u2019s not attacking women he\u2019s mocking asylum seekers in Australian detention centres who have self-harmed. In a post this week headlined KEY WORD: \u2018ATTEMPTS\u2019 Blair said the election result had caused asylum seekers, or what he hilariously calls the \u201coff-shore country-shopper community\u201d to make \u201cplainly inept suicide attempts\u201d. He called on readers to make bets on how many would die by their own hand. \u201cCan they crack the half-century? Or even make it all the way to three figures? Go for it, boaties. \u201c(Note: under official Attention-Seeking Refugee rules, multiple attempts by an individual score only a single point.)\u201d The comments were no better. \u201cGag them and bag them and dump them back in their homeland,\u201d one of Blair\u2019s readers wrote. \u201cSo ... what do they actually do in these alleged \u2018attempts\u2019?\u201d asked another. \u201cSlap themselves senseless with seaweed and flaccid lettuce leaves?\u201d Sharp intake of breath When Channel Nine poached the Triple J newsreader Brooke Boney last year for a revamped Today show it was a cause for celebration. The Gamilaroi woman who grew up in the New South Wales Hunter Valley was to be commercial breakfast TV\u2019s first Indigenous star. She replaced veteran showbiz commentator Richard Wilkins, who moved to a later slot on Today Extra. But the Sunday Telegraph\u2019s gossip columnist Annette Sharp is unimpressed with Boney, giving the 31-year old a C-rating on her \u201creport card\u201d, while handing Wilkins an A and calling for his return. Boney lacked personality and experience and should be dressed in \u201cage appropriate clothing\u201d, Sharp wrote. Sharp made similarly superficial judgements about other members of the Today show cast\u2019s appearance, leading to accusations of sexism. Sharp said Georgie Gardner could improve her sex appeal by showing more cleavage, while Deb Knight was often \u201cneglected by Nine\u2019s hair and makeup\u201d team. Tom Steinfort was \u201cgood looking\u201d but a \u201ctoken male newsreader\u201d. News Corp loses big names Several big names have put their hands up to take redundancies from News Corp following the announcement this week that the company was looking to shed 55 journalists and many more in non-editorial departments across the country. Senior writers include Walkley award-winning journalist and author Paul Toohey, the Courier Mail\u2019s political commentator Dennis Atkins and the Australian\u2019s veteran football writer Ray Gatt. More names are expected to emerge in coming days. The Herald and Weekly Times in Melbourne was hit hard, with at least 15 journalists to go and as many as 25 jobs axed overall. In Adelaide many of the 10 targeted jobs were in the sports department and included commentator and former Crows captain Chris McDermott. In a now deleted tweet, Tiser columnist Caleb Bond said \u201cwatching colleagues being retrenched isn\u2019t fun\u201d. There were four positions lost at the Courier Mail, six in Tasmania and an additional five national positions. Another big name to be leaving the Holt St bunker is columnist Miranda Devine. But Devine is not leaving the company, she is going to New York on an 18-month dream assignment to cover the US elections and write for Murdoch\u2019s New York Post. \u201cFrom New York she will share her insights, analysis and perspective on the election for readers of the Daily Telegraph,\u201d editor Ben English told staff. Target audience The Herald Sun appeared to uncover a new threat to public safety this week with a front page splash about attacks on international students near Monash University. Its headline read: \u201cUNIGANG ATTACKS: Police target thugs robbing foreign students\u201d. \u201cInternational students are being robbed and bashed in a brutal wave of street attacks plaguing eastern suburban Melbourne,\u201d the report said. \u201cMonash University students, many of them from China, are among those being terrorised by cowardly groups of thieves who typically zero in on the victims when they are alone. \u201cChinese student Kuan Gao, 19, said he had been robbed of his iPhone and wallet while walking along a lane near Monash University in Clayton on the night of April 18. \u201c\u2018Three black men very silently ran to me and suddenly took away my phone,\u2019 Mr Gao said.\u201d But Victoria police told us they don\u2019t believe there are gangs of thugs hanging around the university waiting to attack foreign students. \u201cPolice do not believe international students are being targeted for these crimes,\u201d they told Weekly Beast. \u201cWe believe the perpetrators of these offences are opportunistic and are seeing victims of various ethnicities and ages, ranging from the early 20s to early 50s.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
