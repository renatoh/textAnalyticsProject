It's as if they were using warm balls or something to pull England, Wales and Northern Ireland out together. But that wouldn't happen. For the completists out there, for the Africa draw click here, and for the Concaf draw, click here. Then, you'd do well to go to the nearest villain's drinker and talk about it all night long. Thank you and good night and etc. 5.35pm: Right, we're off, and there will be seven groups, 1-8. Keep refreshing this page as the balls are drawn. Group Of Death [1] Andorra, Macedonia, Armenia, Finland, Romania, Netherlands, Czech Republic Group 2 Kazakhstan, Albania, Georgia, Ukraine, Greece, Denmark, Turkey Group 3 Luxembourg, Lichtenstein, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, Russia, Portugal Group 4 Faroe Islands, Cyprus, Israel, Switzerland, REP OF IRELAND, France Group 5 Moldova, Belarus, Norway, SCOTLAND, Slovenia, Italy Group 6 Azerbaijan, NORTHERN IRELAND, WALES, Austria, Poland, ENGLAND!!! Group 7 San Marino, Lithuania, Bosni-H, Serbia &amp; Montenegro, Belgium, Spain Group 8 Malta, Hungary, Iceland, Bulgaria, Croatia, Sweden 5.30pm: Pele has arrived on the scene to talk about the South American qualifying group. He sounds like he's had more than enough Schnapps already. Well, it's free. Because I've so far told you nothing about the draw, Matt Cunningham has cut and pasted the Asian zone. Should you really want to read about it, click here. And the Oceana draw is here. See, we care. 5.26pm: Curious, this. Instead of whipping through the next draw, which I'm praying is the European zone we've been waiting for, Fifa has decided to put on another slide show featuring Ronaldo and Chewbacca, the Bayern Munich goalkeeper, blathering on about nothing at all. Surely the sooner they crack on, the sooner the trolley dollies can wheel out more cake and Schnapps. 5.22pm: Believe me, you're missing nothing, except the sight of steam rising spectacularly from Youssou Ndour's shiny pate. Yes, he of Seven Seconds fame. \"I thought that I was so bored that reading the notes of somebody else who's really bored might be less boring,\" writes Mark Mohan. \"How wrong I was. I'd just like to thank you for reminding me that life is far too short to waste time feedings one's despair and self loathing.\" Oh, that's what I'm here for. \"Obviously you didn't have to give me quite such a practical lesson in that, but thanks anyway.\" 5.19pm: Following complaints about the Schumacher picture, there's a new one up there. It represents my chance of sleeping easy tonight after the excitement of this draw. Oh yes. We're onto the Africa Zone, and I'll try for once to mention a few names. 5.12pm: Just when we feared this couldn't get any more exciting, a 17-piece hip-hop collective named Naturally Seven rumble onto the stage and puff hard into a mic. Oh and look at this - Sepp Blatter's body-popping across the stage like an extra from Fame. Albeit a flabby-breasted extra who quickly gets out of breath. Quite spectacular. 5.05pm: \"Come on, a bit more enthusiasm please,\" demands John Barrington. \"I live here in Mexico and am rather excited I have to say about the Concacaf draw.....so make sure when Mexico are drawn, you type it up at once.... Oh they're already out, John, only we couldn't tell you who they're in with and we don't pretend to know what's going on here. It's not hotting up at all, in fact if anything it feels like the meter's run out in here again. Lummee. 4.55pm And here comes Concacaf! It's North and Central America, plus the Carribean zone. 34 teams, six pots, no interest. Sorry, but I didn't sign up for this. 4.52pm \"Admit it, you'll be off to the pub at five, same as everyone else,\" writes David Cousins. \"No one will notice.\" Quite possibly, but if I did that, David, who would cover the Concacaf draw, eh? 4.50pm Get this, reader: Samoa and American Samoa have both been drawn in Group Two. It's a derby! The Oceania draw's over, and apparently things are now starting to \"Hot up\". I'll be the judge of that. 4.45pm \"That Sean Ingle has done you up like a kipper and no mistake,\" snorts Steve McIntosh, making light of my lot. It's purgatory all right, and here comes the Oceanian group, minus Australia and New Zealand. But don't fret, the Cook Islands are in there. 4.40pm Right, the Asia draw is done and dusted, and the only one I managed to note was that Japan have been drawn in Group Three with Oman, India and Singapore. Certainly whets the appetite. Oh. Erm. Yes. 4.35pm Matt Cunningham from just across the desk has just pointed out that Palestine are involved for the first time since the '30s, and adds snottily that Fifa recognises it as a country even if America doesn't. Sweet baby Jesus, why me? 4.30pm \"Speaking of Sting,\" writes Craig Chisholm, as a slide show drags the draw out yet further, \"after all these years you'd reckon he be quite good at Tantric Sex. If that's the case, why does he feel the need to 'practice' it all the time?\" Never mind that, Laos have been drawn first!! Woo-hoo, this is more like it. 4.25pm The good news is that... No, there is no good news. Not for me at least. The European groups will be drawn last, by the look of things. Frankly, if you come back and refresh this page on Monday morning, this dull charade still won't have cut to the chase. \"Tell them to get on with it, would you, I've far better things to do with my time,\" writes Nick Harper. Yes. First up, and don't shoot all your party poppers at once, reader, it's going to be the Asia draw. If I were you, I'd go home. 4.20pm We're currently being treated to a soft focus montage entitled Time To Make Friends, featuring several Ron Jeremy-esque characters chasing a big globe ball about an airport. And yes, it's every bit as tedious as it sounds. \"I think your job right now is even more boring then mine!!\" writes Tom Collins, who doesn't say what he does. Pin sharpener, maybe? Enlighten us, Tom. 4.15pm Contrary to the rumours buzzing about GU HQ, Sepp Blatter is in the house, and currently banging on about how the spiwit, yes spiwit, of friendship is the key to the 2006 World Cup. \"It says a lot about the draw that even Sting thought it would be too tedious for him to grace with his profound presence,\" opines Duncan McDonnell. Sting unexpectedly pulled out, which surely goes against his tantric tendencies. 4.10pm Actually, it's Alan Mullery, Bobby Gould, some football journalist we've never heard of and Ray Houghton. They're attempting to whip us into some kind of frenzy, a full 917 days before the first ball is kicked in the World Cup finals. Sean Ingle is the devil. 4.10pm Ahead of the draw, which Sean Ingle assured me would take place at 4pm but which shows no sign of starting before TOTP, the Sky Sports studio is choc-full of A-list football pundits - there's Pele, Maradona, both Charlton brothers, Georgie Best and Johan Cruyff. The chat is lively and your host is on the very edge of said seat. More pre-amble, because they won't get started until about 9pm: Oh this is a short straw all right. Had I been in Frankfurt for what promises to be a quite exhilarating World Cup draw this December evening, I'd have been able to take advantage of Fifa's spectacular hospitality. Filling my flabby jowls with pork and pickle pie platters and snorting creme brulee through a \u00a320 note, that kind of thing. But I'm not. I'm sat on a thread-bare seat in Farringdon watching a dark room full of faceless suits watch a tedious ball churning session. This, as Scott Murray might say, is jazz. Pre-amble: Welcome to our live, ball-by-slightly-warmer-ball coverage of the (it says here) 2006 Fifa World Cup Germany Preliminary Draw in Frankfurt. Who will stand between the home nations and a pop at the big one? How come South America has been allowed to bypass this needless charade and just have a big league to sort it all out? And how is Kazakhstan in Europe? The answers to some of these questions will be revealed by Fifa's deputy general secretary, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Champagne, and a \"glittering array of celebrities\" - including a picture-justifying Michael Schumacher."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
