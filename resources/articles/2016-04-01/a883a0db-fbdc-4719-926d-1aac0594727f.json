The panel, sponsored by the Russian Federation, began with an international group of scientists and diplomats explaining the importance of evidence-based drug treatment, before a Russian doctor veered into addiction science denialism. \u201cWe prefer to treat people in a drug-free setting,\u201d Dr Oxana Guseva, a medical representative of the Russian Federation, told the Guardian afterward, \u201cbecause methadone is the same narcotic drug as heroin.\u201d In Russia, heroin addicts are given \u201ccold turkey\u201d detoxification treatment using the medication Naloxone, which blocks opioid receptors in the brain. Typically, this medication is used to stop overdoses. Then, Guseva said, Russian addicts are given social therapy and education as a substitute for conventional opioid replacement therapies, such as methadone clinics, which are common in the United States. While part of the doctor\u2019s statement is true \u2013 methadone and heroin are both narcotic pain treatments \u2013 addiction treatment that uses methadone in place of other opioids is delivered to the body in a much different way. First, methadone clinics provide oral doses, meaning that the body processes the drug more slowly than intravenous heroin. That removes one of the most addictive characteristics of heroin \u2013 the rush. Methadone also stays in the body for a longer period of time. Heroin and opioid painkillers such as Oxycontin last hours, but methadone can have effects for days. Treatment that uses drugs such as methadone, called \u201creplacement therapies\u201d, prevent former addicts from going through painful withdrawals. But they also address a disturbing aspect of addiction \u2013 how it changes the brain\u2019s physiology long-term to accommodate neural pathways for craving and compulsive drug-seeking. America\u2019s top addiction expert, Dr Nora Volkow, director of the National Institutes of Health on Drug Abuse, disputed the Russian doctor\u2019s assertions. \u201cThe data is showing after chronic treatment, some of these patients [addicted to opiates] are able to slowly taper off this medication,\u201d Volkow, referring to therapies such as methadone. However, she said, \u201cthe reality is that in some instances we just cannot achieve [full sobriety] \u2013 and it\u2019s not any different than someone who has diabetes. \u201cIs it that we are substituting and making [diabetics] dependent on insulin?\u201d she asked rhetorically. \u201cPerhaps we could say that, but we could also say it\u2019s a way for them to have a perfectly normal life.\u201d The panel was part of the first UN summit on drug law in 18 years, known as Ungass, or the United Nations General Assembly Special Session. The three-day summit was meant to address the \u201cglobal drug problem\u201d and include debate on how international authorities should move treaties forward to address drug abuse as a public health issue. However, most debate on the agreement adopted took place in Vienna in March, without a majority of member states, and the \u201coutcome document\u201d, as the agreement is known, was adopted immediately after the session opened. The document\u2019s immediate adoption laid bare just how divided the international community is on the issue of drug abuse. Indonesia called the death penalty an \u201cimportant component\u201d of the country\u2019s drug control policy, while liberal states such as Uruguay, Colombia and Norway expressed dismay that the UN failed to condemn such executions. \u201cNorway intends to be a clear voice for a more progressive approach,\u201d the nation\u2019s delegate told the General Assembly on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s too ironic for Russia to be the sponsor of the event,\u201d said Daniel Wolfe, director of the International Harm Reduction Program for the Open Society Foundations. \u201cThey\u2019re the world leader in denying the science.\u201d Russian drug treatment methods were recently tested in Crimea, after the country annexed the former Ukrainian region. Around 800 former heroin addicts there were cut off from replacement therapy, roughly 100 of whom have died, according to advocacy groups and the UN\u2019s special envoy Michel Kazatchkine. Many have blamed Russia\u2019s ban on treatment such as methadone and lack of clean syringe programs for an uptick in new HIV infections even as infection rates in other areas of Europe fall. \u201cIt\u2019s really stupid,\u201d said Pavlo Skala, associate director for the Alliance for Public Health, a Kiev-based organization, who attended the event on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not scientific, as [with] everything related to treatment in Russia.\u201d This article was amended on 21 April 2016 to correct the name of the drug Naloxone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
