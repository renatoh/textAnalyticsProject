The former girlfriend of the Soham murderer Ian Huntley was given a new identity and safe house when she left prison because of potential theats to her life from vigilantes, under an order preventing any details of her life being made public. But in an astonishing twist it emerged last night that she may have breached the order herself by speaking to a Mail on Sunday journalist. Newpapers are due to go back to court this week to try to change the stringent injunction. Home Office sources said the Home Secretary had backed the injunction - sought by Carr's lawyers after she was freed this year after serving 21 months for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice - 'because it was in her best interests that the general public should not know where she was living and what she was doing.' The Home Office must now decide whether it can continue to support the order. Despite strenous efforts to allow her to disappear, Carr, 27, admitted members of the public had already recognised her. In the emotional aftermath of the murders of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells, for which Huntley was jailed for life, she was portrayed as the most reviled woman in Britain and compared to the child killer Myra Hindley. An aggressive tabloid campaign has continued since her release, with descriptions of the luxury in which she is supposedly living - in a safe house whose location, like her new identity, cannot be published because of a court injunction protecting her anonymity. Carr, who provided a false alibi for Huntley, has long insisted she did not know that he had killed the two girls, who were both pupils at the school where she worked as a classroom assistant. The injunction covering Carr prohibits the publication of her new name, address or any care or treatment she is receiving, or any premises she visits in her new life. It also prevents journalists soliciting people for such information. The order was tightened earlier this month after newspaper reports about her new life. The Mail on Sunday last night said that neither Carr nor her family had received any payment for the interview."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
