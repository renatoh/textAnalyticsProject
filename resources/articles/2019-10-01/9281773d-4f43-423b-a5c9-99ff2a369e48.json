Bruce hopes his struggling Newcastle side can recover from last Sunday\u2019s 5-0 humiliation at Leicester by beating the club for whom he once shone at centre-half. Sunday\u2019s meeting of the two Uniteds at St James\u2019 Park may well be a pale shadow of the tight match won 1-0 by Ferguson\u2019s team courtesy of an Eric Cantona goal during the 1995-96 title race but the Newcastle manager\u2019s job security could hinge on an improved performance. Bruce, who played in that classic, will revert to Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u2019s counterattacking, possession-light 3-4-3 formation, with his mind possibly made up during conversations with a certain Scot, starting when Manchester United drew 1-1 with Arsenal. \u201cI always ring Sir Alex for a bit of advice now and again and I\u2019ve spoken to him a couple of times,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cHe\u2019s been terrific. If there\u2019s ever a time you need advice, he\u2019s always there to help. I saw him on Monday night at Old Trafford but you don\u2019t want to know what he said to me.\u201d Bruce is thinking about handing Andy Carroll his first start since the striker rejoined the club, and he hopes for an improved display from Sean Longstaff. Although the midfielder, 22 at the end of this month, remains immensely promising, his progress has been impeded by a combination of the serious knee injury he suffered last spring and persistent summer-time rumours linking him with Manchester United. \u201cSean Longstaff needs to concentrate on his performances, rather than worrying about speculation,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cAll Sean can do now is recover from his bad knee and start playing well again. \u201cHe\u2019s a young lad, he was going to be distracted. But he\u2019s got to learn to just get on with the job in hand and to forget contracts, forget his knee injury, forget Manchester United. It\u2019s all about getting back to playing for us at the level we know he\u2019s capable of.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
