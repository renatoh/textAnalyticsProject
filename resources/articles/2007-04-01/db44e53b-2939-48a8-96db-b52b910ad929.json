Read by Juliet Stevenson Macmillan Audio 3hr \u00a313 Isobel is a girl of 14 whose family scratches a living on poor land, 'the white forest' of rattling dry leaves on the edge of a sugar plantation. When drought, war and corrupt officials intensify their fight for survival, Isobel has to leave to join the exodus to the south. Her beloved brother Isaias has already left to seek work and Isobel embarks on a frightening journey to the alien city to find him. It's brave to write a novel about social dislocation and hunger (there are terrible images of starvation and helplessness), but the author combines empathy with subtle polemic, the whole uplifted by Juliet Stevenson's beautiful narration, which endows these desperate human beings with a great dignity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
