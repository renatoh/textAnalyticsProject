Joe Biden overtook Donald Trump in Georgia, historically a Republican stronghold, at around 4.30am ET to secure a lead of 1,579 votes. Trump and Biden were locked in a tight contest on Friday, with the Democrat edging ahead, to get the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. For Trump, Georgia is a state he must win. But with such a razor-thin margin, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, said ballots will undergo a recount. \u201cRight now, Georgia remains too close to call. Of approximately 5m votes cast, we\u2019ll have a margin of a few thousand,\u201d he said in a press conference. He added: \u201cWith a margin that small, there will be a recount in Georgia.\u201d If Biden goes on to win Georgia, it would mark a major victory for the Democrats \u2013 and a huge upset for the Republicans \u2013 in a state that has been reliably Republican for decades. The last time a Democratic presidential nominee won in the state was Bill Clinton in 1992. In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Georgia by five percentage points. Raffensperger acknowledged that Georgia\u2019s result has \u201chuge implications for the entire country\u201d and officials said the unofficial tally could be completed by the end of the weekend. He added: \u201cThe stakes are high and emotions are high on all sides. We will not let those debates distract us from our work. We will get it right, and we will defend the integrity of our elections.\u201d Georgia does not run automatic recounts, but candidates can request them if the margin is within 0.5%. Meanwhile, two closely watched Senate races in the state will head to a runoff, keeping alive Democrats\u2019 hopes of possibly gaining control of the Senate. The incumbent Republican senator David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff will rematch on 5 January, after neither candidate met the 50% threshold for an outright victory. Georgia\u2019s other Senate seat will also be decided in a runoff, between Democrat Raphael Warnock and the Republican senator Kelly Loeffler. Nationally, the Senate stands at 48-48. But Republicans lead uncalled races in Alaska and North Carolina, so the ultimate balance is likely to come down to what happens in the Georgia runoffs. The announcement of a recount came after a judge dismissed a lawsuit from the Trump campaign over the state\u2019s handling of absentee ballots in Chatham county. The Trump campaign has launched a swath of legal cases across the country, which are largely intended as a distraction and are founded on weak legal arguments, experts say. Matt Morgan, the general counsel for the Trump campaign, said on Friday: \u201cGeorgia is headed for a recount, where we are confident we will find ballots improperly harvested, and where President Trump will ultimately prevail.\u201d Gabriel Sterling, Georgia\u2019s voting system implementation manager, dismissed allegations of fraud, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing any widespread irregularities.\u201d Sterling said that 4,169 ballots, most of which were absentee, were left to be counted from four counties, including Gwinnett county, which includes Atlanta suburbs and in recent years has shifted towards Democrats. The state also has an unknown quantity of military and overseas ballots and an unknown number of provisional ballots to be \u201ccured\u201d. Biden\u2019s strength in Georgia is the result of strong turnout among Black voters in the Atlanta suburbs, which have become younger and increasingly diverse. The Black Voters Matter Fund, a non-profit that advocates for increasing voter registration and access, hailed the impact of Black voters in Georgia, who they said \u201csaved the election\u201d. They said more than a million Black voters cast their ballots early in the state \u2013 exceeding 2016 numbers \u2013 and reported a \u201csurge\u201d in registration and turnout among young Black voters. Co-founders LaTosha Brown and Cliff Albright said: \u201cA new south is rising, and Georgia is the beacon \u2026 Georgia is at the epicenter of this country right now and we are claiming victory.\u201d It is also a product of the work of figures such Stacey Abrams, who since losing the state\u2019s 2018 race for governor has thrown her efforts into Fair Fight, an organization she founded that focuses on combating voter suppression. According to electoral research by the Associated Press, there have been at least 31 statewide recounts since 2000, of which three changed the outcome of an election. But in those the initial margins were even slimmer \u2013 in the low hundreds rather than thousands. Many analysts believe Georgia\u2019s shift to becoming a swing state is almost inevitable \u2013 an assessment that is reflected in the energies invested into the state by the Biden campaign. In the final weeks before the election, Biden, his running mate Senator Kamala Harris and former president Barack Obama all paid visits. Trump also rallied there. \u201cCan you believe it? Two days from now, we\u2019re going to win this state again and we\u2019re going to win four more great years in the White House,\u201d Trump told supporters in the Georgia city of Rome on Sunday.
