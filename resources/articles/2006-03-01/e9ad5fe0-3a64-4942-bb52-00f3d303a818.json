With less than 24 hours to go until the Lib Dem result, PoliticalBetting.com is tipping Ming to win. That's very good news for Nick Clegg and Sarah Teather, though they should make sure they change the rules that prevented leadership candidates from writing to members. We'll have full coverage of the result - expected in the early afternoon - on Guardian Unlimited Politics. A LEADING QUESTION Ken was in ebullient mood at last night's people's question time at the Hackney Empire, and not surprisingly - 84% of the audience punched no on their wireless voting pads when he asked them whether he should have been suspended. It was just a little unfortunate that the human or machine who was typing the speakers' words on a screen at the back of the stage couldn't forget about the affair of the pesky Evening Standard reporter and Jewish concentration camp guard. \"Can we have your views on Judy's question?\" the chair, Jennette Arnold, asked Ken at one point. \"Can we have your views on Jew decent question?\" read the screen. Much to the Backbencher's disappointment, Ken earlier confirmed that he had no plans to appeal to the \"workers and peasants of the world\" for a Let Ken Say What the Hell He Likes fighting fund. The awful prospect of re-mortgaging the newt tank looms. GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT \"Watch vile Hamza's rap at www.thesun.co.uk from 10am.\" No, not the cleric recently banged up for preaching hatred, but his son Mohammed Kamel Mostafa, who has left the Islamic rap group Lionz of Da Dezert in order to go solo. The Backbencher is not a fan of Hamza junior's lyrics (\"we're jihad through, defend my religion with the holy sword\") and nor, she imagines, is the Home Office. But that didn't prevent the Sun from making them available on its website. Curiously, too, the Times chose to make Hamza's rantings available on its website, even after he was jailed last month. Times Online is not the only place to hear him fulminate on-demand, of course, but the imprisoned cleric would be pleased to hear that the mainstream media are broadcasting his message. MUG ENOUGH? Roll up, roll up, because it's not too late to obtain a Simon Hughes for Leader campaign mug for the bargain price of GBP13. The Backbencher knew the Lib Dems' spending commitments were a little flaky, but thirteen quid for a mug is testing even his own supporters' generosity. A BURNING PASSION Thankfully, no Backbencher reader has written in to clarify the location of Stephen Pound's tattoo. She can't be too hard on the Ealing MP, as the gum he's been chewing while giving up smoking has pulled out all his filings. Stephen told the BBC today that he used to smoke before, after and even during the act of congress. And she doesn't mean the TUC's annual get-together. WHO AM I? Overheard outside the Lib Dem leadership hustings at the Friends' Meeting House at Euston last Thursday: \"Don't you know who I am? I was one of the Gang of Four!\" JUST LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS Was it just bad luck that the Bow Group sent out the invitation to its annual dinner on the same day as Dynamite Dave's shimmering bash at Vinopolis? Comparisons are invidious, of course, but while the SE1 postcode was right, the Backbencher couldn't help thinking that the promise of \"half a bottle of wine with dinner\" at the Anchor Pub in the company of a dead sheep was less than appealing. The old-style dress code (\"lounge suit\" for the men, whatever that might mean for the ladies) is also regrettable. Get with the Built to Last programme, guys. What on earth are you going to do if Dave turns up without a tie? LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION Congratulations to Vijaya Sankar, who identified James Gurling, Charles Kennedy's brother-in-law, as Simon Hughes' celebrity supporter. THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION This week, the Backbencher has a copy of Fred Anderson and Andrew Cayton's The Dominion of War: Empire and Conflict in America, 1500-2000, courtesy of Atlantic Books. \"They offer striking illustrations of how relations with Native Americans powerfully shaped the origins of the American empire, and how that empire eventually expelled or destroyed the continent's original inhabitants,\" said the LRB. For a chance of winning a copy, just identify the man who told George Bush this week: \"As far as I'm concerned, I can only ask that we brought into politics the values which pertain to the world of work and business, and the world of sport. Because in politics, people changing frequently, their minds and positions are considered to be professional. While on the contrary in the world of business or the world of sports, a person who changes constantly his position and never keeps his promises is cornered, or even set outside.\" (That's the White House's translation, for which the Backbencher apologises.) Terms and conditions are here. FROM MICHAEL WHITE IN WESTMINSTER \"So the press gallery was informed, the Colombian pop sensation Shakira was in the private gallery. And, although she seemed very polite about it and laughed when everyone else did, it must have been absolutely baffling for her as it is for most visitors. What did she understand - if she speaks good enough English to follow the repartee? Well she understood if she were watching David Cameron that he is greatly enjoying trying to embarrass Tony Blair over the education bill. \"Throughout questions Mr Cameron sought to divide Mr Blair from his own side. He said: 'Now let's make it clear: Do these trust schools - you're not calling them trust schools any more, they're foundation schools - have the same powers and legal basis of independence as the trust schools which were in the white paper which has been replaced by the bill this week.' Mr Blair said they did. \"Mr Cameron said - and rather a good joke this I thought: \"We back school freedom, there are 200 of us, if he can just get muster 150 Labour MPs we can get on and, as you say, pass this bill.\" \"Later on Mr Blair made an interesting boast. He said, when taunted by another Labour MP, that there would be more Labour MPs than Tory MPs in the 'yes' lobby. Now that's an interesting boast if you think about it for a second it's a pretty safe bet for the prime minister. There are approximately 350 Labour MPs and just under 200 Tory MPs in the present parliament. It only needs the government payroll vote of 100 plus another 100 loyalists which he'll surely get - probably nearer 200 - and that will easily outvote the Tories. But it is a reminder that Mr Blair has maybe 60-70 hardcore rebels who've not yet been persuaded to support this bill. \"What else happened? Well, Mr Cameron started off with a slightly sly joke. All the party leaders made reference today to two sad events: the death of two more British soldiers in Iraq and the heart surgery which the speaker Michael Martin has undergone. But Mr Cameron coupled it with a more joyous event, namely the birth of his infant son Arthur. He thanked Mr Blair for the flowers for his wife from No 10. He said somewhat mischievously and somewhat naughtily - some of my colleagues thought - that he had also received flowers from No 11 Downing Street. 'I am the first man in history to be 'bunched' by both our prime ministers.' \"What else came up? Well, everybody's intrigued about the fate of the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, and her husband, David Mills. [Today] everybody held their fire - nobody wants to be seen to be unfair and equally nobody wants to interfere with a process which is going on with the cabinet secretary Sir Gus, so all we had today in the half an hour session was one Tory MP Richard Bacon asking Mr Blair if the Home Office had acted in any way improperly regarding attempts by the Italian investigating authorities to extradite Mr Mills in, I think, 2005. Mr Blair said that everything would be looked at in a proper way and that was all we got of the great drama of the moment. \"Menzies Campbell went back to one of his favourite themes: Guantanamo Bay. Mr Blair has famously said it's an anomaly which ought to be ended sooner or later. 'Is that sooner or later,' he asked and Mr Blair said: 'Well, when the judicial process for handling these cases is in place it ought to close. I've said that and I've said it several times. But I ought to qualify it by saying you've got to remember why it was opened.'\" * This is an edited version of Michael White's full audio report, which is available in MP3 format.
