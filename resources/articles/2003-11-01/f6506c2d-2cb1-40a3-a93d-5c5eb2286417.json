Are these an acceptable thing to wear abroad? And as they're not cheap, can I wear them in the UK with my head held high?\" You've got to deal with two issues: one, are you organised enough to guarantee not losing one of the zipped-off bits? Because noone wants a pair of trousers with one leg long and one lopped off. Secondly, are you used to dealing with funny looks because of your clothes, and if you're not, are you ready to get used to it? Rohan don't ever go for crazy colours - these are travel clothes to make you blend in, rather than shout, \"hey, I'm a tourist having wild tie-dye experiences\" - but a zip-down-there is always going to attract attention. Do you want people looking at your calf, be it covered or on free view? If you wore them in the UK, do you want people to think you're a fan of tricksy utilitarian clothing details? Basically Rohan make shamelessly functional clothing, so your reasons for wearing them must be shamelessly functional (ie you're the sort of traveller who packs with minimalist precision rather than taking an extra four outfits just in case). By the tone of your question it sounds like you are worried as much about fashion as you are about function so why not go the whole hog and get the Rohans, but also pack some hot pants, tennis shorts, safari shorts and cropped trousers as well, just to cover all bases, eh? \u00b7 If you have a question you would like to put to our fashion experts, email travel.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
