The retailer said a one-adult-per-household rule was intended to help keep customers and store workers better protected from the highly contagious coronavirus. \u201cFrom today, we are asking everyone to please only send one adult per household to our shops,\u201d said the supermarket\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, in a letter to customers. \u201cThis helps us keep people a safe distance apart and also helps reduce queues to get into stores. Our store teams will be asking groups with more than one adult to choose one adult to shop and will ask other adults to wait. Children of course are welcome if they are not able to stay at home.\u201d The rule is being introduced as Sainsbury\u2019s joined other retailers in loosening purchasing restrictions on most items from Sunday after a wave of panic buying subsided. . Coupe said supermarket shelves were now full throughout the day. \u201cMost people are now just buying what they need for themselves and their families. This means we now often have stock on the shelves all day and at the end of the day.\u201d Coupe said limits on the number of items customers could buy would start to be removed and a three Easter egg limit hadbeen scrapped immediately. Coupe said limits would remain on popular items including UHT milk, pasta and tinned tomatoes.
