The annual report, now in its fifth year, ranks the amount of information companies disclose about social and environmental policies, processes and effects within their operations and supply chains. Puma, Asos, Nike and VF Corporation \u2013 the company behind brands including The North Face, Timberland, Vans and Wrangler \u2013 are also in the top 10. The joint lowest-scoring brands included Bally, Jessica Simpson (the pop star\u2019s label), Max Mara, Mexx, Pepe Jeans and Tom Ford, all of which revealed nothing at all about their practices for 2020. The report investigates brands with a minimum turnover of $400m (\u00a3320m), scoring them based on a detailed analysis of 200 indicators ranging from human rights to the use of plastics. This year\u2019s report investigated more brands than ever \u2013 250, up from 200 last year. On average, brands achieved a score of 23%, up two percentage points from last year. The top-performing company, H&amp;M Group \u2013 which covers brands including &amp; Other Stories, Arket, Monki and Weekday \u2013 scored 73%, having scored 61% last year. The most improved brands included Monsoon, up 23 points this year, the Italian brand Zegna, up 22 points, and Sainsbury\u2019s Tu, up 19 points. More brands than ever disclosed their suppliers, with 40% disclosing their top-tier suppliers, up from 35% last year. According to Sarah Ditty, the policy director at Fashion Revolution and the author of the report, it is not an examination of how ethical or sustainable the brands are, but rather measures their transparency. Although there were obvious \u201celephant in the room issues\u201d about some of the top performers, including \u201cproducing too much\u201d and not doing enough to improve workers\u2019 low wages, Ditty said consumers should take heart from the fact that \u201csome brands really are taking some significant steps\u201d. Transparency is key to the creation of a cleaner, greener fashion industry, given its particular reliance on complex, multinational supply chains. These make it difficult for customers to make ethical choices and for stakeholders to hold brands to account when things go wrong. The index was launched as part of Fashion Revolution week, a series of events that commemorate the 2013 Rana Plaza disaster, when a large textiles factory collapsed in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, killing 1,134 people. The key takeaway for customers, said Ditty, should be to look at the \u201cbig swathe of brands that are not disclosing any information at all\u201d about their operations and supply chains \u2013 \u201cthe people lagging behind, either because they are not prioritising the issues or because they are doing good things behind the scenes but not sharing it\u201d. There is growing evidence, she added, that consumers from all groups \u201care more and more interested in ethical and sustainable issues\u201d. Sharing information \u201cmight give customers a bit more trust in what they are doing\u201d. The research was undertaken before the Covid-19 pandemic. The crisis has made the issues of transparency more pressing than ever, said Carry Somers, the co-founder of Fashion Revolution \u2013 millions of garment workers in Bangladesh face ruin as western brands cancel orders. \u201cThis crisis has started to bring to light some of the systemic problems within the industry and revealed just how fragile the system is,\u201d said Somers. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind,\u201d she said, that companies \u201chave both the resources and the ability \u2013 notwithstanding the moral imperative \u2013 to fulfil their commitments to their suppliers.\u201d Companies\u2019 corporate social responsibility documents, she added, \u201crefer to suppliers as partners, but when it comes down to the wire one of these partners pays the price while the other cuts and runs\u201d. As we come out of the other side of this crisis, Somers said, transparency will be vital \u201cto start to build a more responsible industry\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
