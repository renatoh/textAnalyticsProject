There may still be the occasional pang for the Twin Towers or the hustle and bustle of Wembley Way, but the Reds are invincible in the Welsh capital. The bulging Anfield trophy cabinet, bloated by last year's Worthington and FA Cups, is testament to that. Strange, then, that the man who lifted the second of their trio of trophies last season can barely suppress a shudder as he recalls those ecstatic scenes in May. \"It was a lovely gesture from Robbie Fowler and Sami Hyypia to let me accept the cup, but I couldn't help feeling I didn't deserve it,\" says Jamie Redknapp. \"One day I'll lift a trophy when I'm not wearing a suit.\" The England international's chance may come this season. While common sense suggests that last term's 10-point chasm between Manchester United and second-place Arsenal can hardly have narrowed after the champions' \u00a351.1m spending spree this summer, the country is clamouring for a challenger: after 11 years without a league title, enter Liverpool. Redknapp has more reason than most to relish the year ahead. As the longest-serving player at Anfield, he is a rare link between the post-Kenny Dalglish years of relative underachievement and Gerard Houllier's re-birth of Liverpool. That alone must have made watching from the sidelines all the more agonising. The 28-year-old midfielder assumed the captaincy two years ago, but has made only three first-team starts since November 1999. None of them came last season. \"It was a bad year to miss, admittedly,\" he shrugs, casting an accusing glance at his left knee. Last year was spent shuttling backwards and forwards across the Atlantic to consult Dr Richard Steadman, the man hoping to restore Alan Shearer to full fitness. The knee's cartilage and bone have now been successfully reshaped: \"It's been rebuilt and should be as right as rain\" Houllier has taken similar care in sculpting the Liverpool side in the intervening period. There may have been only one addition to the squad - the versatile Norwegian John Arne Riise - in the summer, but his side smacks of genuine quality: from the experienced know-how of Gary McAllister to the youthful zest of Steven Gerrard; the brute force of Emile Heskey to the sublime Finnish flicks of Jari Litmanen. \"Things have changed since I last played,\" says Redknapp, who won the last of his 17 England caps in the Euro 2000 play-off qualifier against Scotland. \"For a start I'm one of the oldest players here, which is weird. The lads set a standard last season and now everyone wants us to be challenging for the top honours. The team proved to itself and to a lot of other people what it can do last year. \"United are a great side, let's be honest. They've added to their midfield and forward line - both of which were brilliant anyway - and that shows real desire, but we're going to challenge them this season.\" Such optimism will delight the red half of Merseyside and, given Redknapp's experiences since he arrived at Anfield back in 1991, should not ring hollow. As a member of Roy Evans's side that imploded so spectacularly during their run-in four years ago, he has seen success snatched away. \"We made mistakes, stupid mistakes,\" he says. \"In 1997 we were at the top of the league and had reached the semi-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup, but it all went wrong right at the end. We wouldn't make those same mistakes again.\" His manager is all too aware of the expectations, but remains steeped in reality. Not since Manchester United in 1996-97 has a team managed to follow up victory in the Charity Shield with the Premiership crown. \"That may affect my selection,\" Houllier jokes. \"This game will give us an indication of where we stand. Liverpool is all about winning trophies - this is a trophy, so that is our immediate incentive, but our priority is the league. Winning the three cups has just made my players hungrier. \"Personally, I still think Manchester United's team is better than mine, although that doesn't mean we won't improve and reach their level. At the moment they have players who have more experience than ours. We beat them twice last season and they still finished 11 points clear of us, so that's something to think about. We have to catch up. That's what we are doing, but the gap won't be closed overnight. \"But what is important is we have the same level of hunger as them. If you have that inner resolve and desire to win, it shows on the field - how you defend as a team when you don't have the ball, and how you are always eager to win possession back. Both teams have that same winning edge.\" It may be nothing but a season curtain-raiser, a high-profile showcase that both managers might privately admit they could do without, but tomorrow's match should be a typically feisty affair. True to Redknapp's abysmal luck, the captain may have to play another walk-on part. A groin strain sustained in training kept him out of their latest cup victory - the 5-0 Champions League stroll against Haka Valkeakoski in Helsinki on Wednesday - and at best will leave him champing at the bit on the bench. \"You can expect something like this after not playing for 18 months,\" his manager says reassuringly. With a heavy schedule ahead of them, Redknapp may be joined in the dug-out by Gerrard although Sander Westerveld could return in goal. \"Jamie's worked so hard to get his fitness back. He mustn't let this niggle get to him.\" \"At least the knee is fine,\" adds the midfielder. \"I've been so patient for all that time that it would be foolish to mess it all up now. I have to prove myself this year - that makes me nervous, but you've got to be strong. This could be a big year and I want to be part of it, and not just in a collar and tie.\" Kick-off: 2pm TV: Live, Sky Sports 2, 1pm; highlights, BBC1, 6.55pm, 1.05am Referee Andy D'Urso (Billericay) Liverpool Subs from Arphexad, Heggem, Wright, Traor\u00e9, Gerrard, Riise, Biscan, Murphy, Diom\u00e8de, Heskey, Litmanen Doubtful Westerveld (thigh), Redknapp (groin) Injured Smicer (achilles, Aug 18) Manchester United Subs from Carroll, Chadwick, Cole, Irwin, Johnsen, P Neville, Solskjaer, Van der Gouw, Wallwork, Yorke Doubtful None Injured None Unavailable Veron (International duty)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
