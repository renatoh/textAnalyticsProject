Rania Matar's A Girl And Her Room photographic exhibition reveals teen girls in their most treasured spaces; a film series at the Mosaic rooms offers a crash course in the latest in Arabic cinema; winners of the International Prize for Arabic Fiction will read at the Southbank; and the Barbican will transform into Tahrir Square for a \"people power\" concert. Various venues, Mon to 24 Jul, london.gov.uk/shubbak Clare Considine Psychedelia Conference, Cambridge The history and influence of the psychedelic movement is explored in this programme of talks and screenings in the rural surroundings of Wysing's arts venue. Academics Jonathan Harris, William Rowlandson and Roger Buckley hold forth on the art, literature and the psychological impact of the period when seeing bands, paintings and possibly your own face melting was, ostensibly, declared to be a good thing. Artists in residence, including Damien Roach and Kate Owens, will also be on hand to showcase their work \u2013 as will Mark Essen and Hilary Koob-Sassen, whose work engages with popular culture and the politics of social space. Wysing Arts Centre, Sat, wysingartscentre.org Iain Aitch Banbury Hobby Horse Festival, Banbury There'll be prancing in the streets \u2013 and a touch of Wicker Man whimsy \u2013 as Banbury's annual procession sees fine ladies and four-legged brutes resurrecting the famous Ride A Cock-Horse nursery rhyme. The event \u2013 which invites groups from across Britain to design and parade elaborate horse and beast costumes \u2013 began in 2000 to reinstate the town's age-old dancing and dress-up customs, banned by the Puritans 400 years ago. Today's revellers can enjoy live music, morris and maypole dancing, wacky races, tea and (Banbury) cakes before gorging themselves at a \"feast of the beasts\" banquet.
