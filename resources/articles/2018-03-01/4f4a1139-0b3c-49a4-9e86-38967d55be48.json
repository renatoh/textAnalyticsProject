The former Today Tonight journalist Frank Pangallo is, along with Xenophon\u2019s former advisor Connie Bonaros, one of two SA-Best candidates likely to secure a seat in the legislative council out of election which saw the Liberals return to power under Steven Marshall. Pangallo told Guardian Australia attack campaigns from the pokies lobby, unions and the two major parties were a \u201ctsunami of negativity\u201d SA-Best couldn\u2019t overcome in its bid to win lower house seats. \u201cWe knew it was going to be dirty, but not as dirty as it would be,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my 46 years in the media and politics this is the dirtiest campaign I\u2019ve ever seen waged.\u201d He said the South Australian branch of the Australian Hotels Association \u201cbought the election for the Liberal party\u201d by spending millions of dollars on television advertising, campaign donations to both the Liberal and Labor candidates, letterboxing and ground-level campaigning. The campaign was particularly vigorous in Hartley, the seat which Xenophon himself lost to Liberal incumbent Vincent Tarzia. Pangallo also hit out at what he said were false claims made by the unions and Labor about Xenophon\u2019s record of cutting education budgets and pensions. \u201cThey are outrageous lies, I\u2019d like to change the Electoral Act,\u201d he said. \u201cThese claims and advertisements need to be critically analysed, I\u2019m pushing for truth in advertising judged by an independent authority. The South Australian Electoral Commission does not do enough.\u201d When Xenophon appointed Pangallo as his media adviser in July last year, it seemed unlikely that nine months later the party leader would be out of office and the former journalist known for his confrontational style would be in power. Pangallo admitted the party\u2019s probable failure to secure a single seat in the lower house fell short of even his earliest expectations when first enlisting with Xenophon\u2019s startup political movement. Months before Xenophon quit federal politics and polls predicted SA-Best had a legitimate chance at forming government, Pangallo says he was \u201cconfident of at least five or six lower house seats\u201d. \u201cWe went too big, too quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, we shouldn\u2019t have gone with 36 candidates, we didn\u2019t have the resources and should have stayed under 20. The candidates didn\u2019t have enough time to campaign in their electorates.\u201d Observers have noted the campaign also appeared to lack the resources or structure to develop detailed policy positions on a range of platforms. SA-Best\u2019s musical-themed advertising campaign also attracted plenty of scorn. Pangallo said Xenophon was \u201cdisappointed they bit off more than they could chew\u201d but would remain an important part of the party decision-making process. Despite not being elected, Xenophon will serve as a \u201cmentor\u201d to Pangallo and Bonaros as they enter into a situation similar to the Nick Xenophon Team\u2019s position in the federal Senate. Although final numbers are to be determined, the Liberal government elected in South Australia is certain to need support of crossbenchers in the upper house, meaning SA-Best will enjoy significant negotiating power. \u201cNick certainly has a strong role to continue to play in SA-Best and in politics,\u201d Pangallo said. \u201cHe is the leader, but we consult with each other and are all about consensus.\u201d Xenophon himself has ruled out taking the spots of one of SA-Best\u2019s council members in a casual vacancy, and at a press conference on Sunday on the steps of South Australia\u2019s Parliament House, he indicated he wanted to take a step back from politics for a period. Xenophon also brought up a text message he said he received from someone in the gaming lobby threatening to \u201ckill you all off\u201d. Pangallo had his own warning for the pokies industry. \u201cThey wanted to kill us off, but they haven\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may have won battle, but they haven\u2019t won the war. I haven\u2019t gone away, and neither has Nick.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
