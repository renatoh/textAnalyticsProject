And certainly it was unwise to be caught on tape berating England's travelling supporters after the dismal draw with Algeria. But then, this just hasn't been a good time for the pugnacious Wayne Rooney. He will wonder why the dip in form came at just the wrong time. And given the attempt by the footballer's lawyers to restrict the sales of Rooney's Gold, the loathsome book about his life and times written by the equally feisty BBC hack John Sweeney, Wayne might also reasonably ask why, when the frighteners have been put on WHSmith and Waterstone's, his own employers \u2013 Manchester United \u2013 are selling it on the club's official website United Direct: \u00a316.99 for the hardback he detests. It's a snip. \u2022 The issue of gay bishops has them marching as to war within the church and no mistake. How can we have Jeffrey John, an openly gay man, as bishop of Southwark, thundered traditionalist canon Chris Sugden on the Today programme yesterday? Yes, it's muskets at dawn, and when the hostilities begin, look out for the Rev Paul Perkin, a member of the Church of England General Synod and vicar of the deeply evangelical St Mark's in Battersea, part of the Southwark diocese in south London. He strongly opposes the proposed candidature of John, and the cut of his jib is such that his parish website programme page is decorated with cartoon graphics of military tanks. \"Faith Under Fire,\" reads the caption. Those who feel threatened will inevitably fire back. \u2022 What, might we ask, has become of the Ed Balls-inspired refit at the Department for Education? The one eagerly seized upon by the Tories as proof of profligacy and New Labour vanity? Opulent Ed, they called him in the Mail. Well, the answer is that not much has happened because the \"contemplation room\" that generated so much outrage turns out to be what Balls always said it was: a prayer room used by some staff during the day to pray in. The gym, which staff pay for, is cupboard-sized, as is the \"massage\" room. At the moment it's largely being used for storage. Under Labour things were much the same. \u2022 For all that, the cold wind of financial rectitude can be felt at Plymouth University and that is no more than anyone expected. The budgetary tightening can't help but \"impact negatively on the university sector\", vice-chancellor Wendy Purcell said. Indeed, should things get any worse, the university may not have funds enough for the new chauffeur it seeks to ferry Professor Purcell and her senior team around in a BMW. And that's the tragedy of the financial crisis. It blights futures, ruins lives. \u2022 We must protect our key people, particularly in the public sector. So it's great to see Ian Watmore returned to government from the backwater that is the Football Association to serve as permanent secretary in the Con-Dem government's much trumpeted efficiency and reform group. Soon he will update his email out-of-office message, which as things stand, is two years out of date, referring to his previous stint in government. Then the drive toward greater efficiency can begin. \u2022 Finally, one notes that Chris Bryant MP, former deputy leader of the House, former Foreign Office minister, is putting years of experience at the disposal of new MPs as of today by offering them quick tours of the Palace of Westminster. Good for them to get up to speed as quickly as possible. \"MPs may be asked at short notice to give tours of parliament for constituents, often when the official tours are fully booked,\" the email to Labour's new intake says. And definitely this has everything to do with his goodness of heart: nothing to do with the forthcoming shadow cabinet elections. He wants to be helpful. If the newbies choose to reward him, so be it. diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
