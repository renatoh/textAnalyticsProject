Ask just about anyone in the game for a view on the Masters champion and the responses nearly always centre on the young Texan\u2019s air of maturity. Speaking for the majority, the former Ryder Cup captain Paul Azinger summed it up best when he called Spieth \u201ca grown man.\u201d It is not just his golf, impressive though that has been over the last two days at Chambers Bay, where Spieth sits five under par after rounds of 68 and then 67. As many of his fellow competitors have wallowed in pools of self-pity, moaning and groaning about the quality of the greens and the eccentricity of the course, the two-times US junior champion has quietly and efficiently gone about his business. Asked about the obvious variance in speed green-to-green, Spieth, an inveterate and sometimes self-abusive talker on the course, was his usual thoughtful self. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like they are pretty consistent overall. But what is true is that the green speeds on the course are significantly slower than they are on the practice greens. That can be tough to adjust to when you are 40 feet from the cup.\u201d In other words, while others are shaking their heads, Spieth is nodding acceptance of the way things are. As the leading swing coach Peter Kostis points out: \u201cGolf is about awareness and adjustment. If greens are not good, deal with it. Make the adjustment.\u201d No one does that better than the young man who was good enough to finish in a tie for 16th place in a PGA Tour event (the 2010 Byron Nelson Classic in his hometown of Dallas) at the age of 16; who shot what was surely the best round of 2014, a last round 63 in tough conditions to win the Australian Open; and who led the University of Texas to a national championship victory at the end of his only year \u201cin school\u201d. Speaking of which, Spieth\u2019s rapid ascent to almost the very top of the game \u2013 he is currently ranked as the world No2 behind Rory McIlroy \u2013 has been smooth but not uninterrupted. Towards the end of 2012 he failed at the second stage of the PGA Tour\u2019s qualifying school. Not that he slowed up much. In his first Masters, Spieth finished in a tie for second place; in his first Players Championship he was tied for fourth. Clearly, he is a man unafraid of the big occasion. But not, statistically at least, for the big shots. Last year, Spieth ranked 90th in driving distance, 137th in driving accuracy, 150th in total driving and 122nd in greens in regulation. When it comes to clubhead speed, his relatively puny 111.92mph was only the 115th fastest on the PGA Tour. No matter. In the only number that really counts, he was eighth in scoring. To quote the late four-times Open champion Bobby Locke, Spieth plays golf \u201cbadly well\u201d. That was certainly the story of his opening round 68 here. Clearly unhappy with his ball striking, Spieth somehow managed to get round in two under par in what were the toughest conditions of the first day. \u201cI wasn\u2019t pleased with the way I hit the ball,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I putted well. My swing is a little off, though. It\u2019s close. But I need to find the same rhythm I had when I got here.\u201d Mission accomplished. Out in the morning on day two, Spieth was quick to make his move. Birdies at the 10th (his first), 14th, 15th and 17th took him on to the first page of the leaderboard before a double-bogey via sand and rough at the closing hole slowed his progress. A four followed at the par-five 1st \u2013 a \u201cbounce back birdie\u201d in PGA Tour-speak \u2013 further evidence of Spieth\u2019s ability to absorb punishment. \u201cJordan finds a way to make the 10-foot putts for pars that really count,\u201d says Europe\u2019s former Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley, here as a commentator for Sky Sports. \u201cThe ones that keep a score going when you are struggling a little bit. There is no finer putter in the game today.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
