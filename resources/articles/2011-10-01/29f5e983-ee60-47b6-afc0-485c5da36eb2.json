My role is to collect, preserve and make as accessible as possible the government record and legislation, to support and lead the archive sector and to ensure good information management across government. You are the keeper of public records, historic manuscripts commissioner and the government's head of profession in knowledge and information management \u2013 are these aspects of your job natural bedfellows? It's a long title. But we are the ultimate bastion of transparency and these three roles reflect the work of looking after our knowledge now and making it available for the future. It ensures that policymakers and politicians can get the best out of it in the long-term. What qualities do you think you bring to the job? The majority of my career has been with information services. This means that I understand how researchers and the 22 million users of our information can get the maximum potential out of what is available to them. I and the organisation also have a long-term perspective that is rare in the fast-moving world of government and this unique view is very valuable. What are the big challenges facing your organisation? We face three major challenges: first, to continue providing great public service at much lower cost. Second, the move to a 20-year rule [for release of government records], which will effectively double the rate of records coming to us, and third getting digital records to really work for researchers and the public. How big is the role of digital and what do you still need to achieve in this area? Digital records pose a huge challenge but the most important thing is that the way government manages and archives digital records has to become business-as-usual. Previous attempts have often failed to archive them effectively (outside the UK) but we think we have the approach and the technology to get this right and the 1bn hits on our successful web archive show us at least part of the way ahead. What has been your biggest achievement in the National Archives (and elsewhere)? It's not just me, it's the wider team, but in a challenging financial environment we've managed our costs effectively at the same time as delivering improved public services and investment for the future. That's a pretty unique achievement I think. Specifically the launches of the open government Licence and legislation.gov.uk have shown our capacity for innovation. How important is transparency of information in both the private and public sector? It's fundamental. It drives performance, builds a new relationship with the public and cuts costs. There is the chance for the private sector to learn from the public sector in this area. If you want to cut costs in your business, making expenses transparent, even if it's only internally, can make a big difference. You've worked in other fields including shipping \u2013 are you where you want to be in your career? This job couldn't be better \u2013 it combines a fascinating past, with some major challenges right now, and a unique perspective on the future. One of the commonalities is the companies and organisations I have worked for have always looked to the long-term, rather than just the next quarter. What's your leadership style? Maybe you should ask my team. But we have a really important role in government, a five-word vision, transparent and clear objectives, and we want people to be successful and enjoy their work.
