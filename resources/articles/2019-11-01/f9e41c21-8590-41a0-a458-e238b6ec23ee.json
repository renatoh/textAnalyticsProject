When we were in Russia last year it was amazing to see how excited the fans were back home. We know they are going to be right behind us if we are playing good football and winning games, and the chance to do it in our own country gives us all a great buzz. \u201cRealistically, this is as close to a home tournament as most of us are going to get in our playing careers. We could be playing the first three games at Wembley and you can\u2019t ask for much more than that.\u201d Though Pickford believes England have learned a lot from last year\u2019s progress to the World Cup semi-finals in Russia he also recognises the make-up of the squad has changed considerably over the past 18 months. What was already a young group of players has managed to get even younger. \u201cThe squad is always developing, it\u2019s good to see new faces and new competition,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s been a few changes since Russia but we are all hungry, that\u2019s the important thing. Callum, Jadon and Mason [Hudson-Odoi, Sancho and Mount] are the latest lads to make the step up and it\u2019s brilliant. \u201cThe manager keeps saying if you are good enough you are old enough, but he knows there is a system in place at the moment. Everyone comes through the ranks from a young age \u2013 I started with England in the under-16s \u2013 so you get bedded into the set-up from an early age. It\u2019s great that you can see a clear pathway from the U16s right through to the seniors, and I think we are all seeing the results at the moment.\u201d One of the benefits Gareth Southgate is seeing from a group of young and dedicated individuals is the enthusiasm and team spirit that manifests itself in get-togethers. Clearly in the week of the Raheem Sterling-Joe Gomez spat there is no need to pretend England training camps resemble group love-ins \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s all been dealt with, we move on as a group,\u201d Pickford says \u2013 but he insists there is a camaraderie and positivity within the squad that has not always been the case with previous generations. \u201cI can\u2019t say too much about what happened in the past but, speaking for myself, I love coming away with England, I enjoy every minute of these international squad sessions and I think everyone else would say the same thing,\u201d he admits. \u201cEveryone gets on, everyone always has a good laugh. It\u2019s all about having fun, but when we need to be serious, we are serious. When we are on the training pitch we are on our A game; off the pitch it\u2019s about enjoying the privilege of representing England, which everyone should do. I think I can speak for the rest of the lads and say meeting up in the England squad is something we all like doing.\u201d A vocal character on and off the pitch, Pickford is known for his sense of humour, but he also appreciates that football can be a cruel business. He was on the pitch when Andr\u00e9 Gomes suffered his fractured ankle at Goodison Park this month, and though not particularly close to the incident he still had to make sense of a whirlwind of emotions. \u201cI could tell it was something fairly horrendous but it was on the other side of the pitch and I didn\u2019t really want to go over because as soon as loads of people start doing that you get into shock,\u201d he explains. \u201cPlus we still had a game to play and we were losing 1-0. I spent what was left of the match trying to get the lads reset and focused back on the game. \u201cAfterwards I tried to help Sonny [Son Heung-min] for Spurs as well, because I didn\u2019t think he meant to do it. You never want to see that sort of injury in football but you know the game has the potential to be dangerous. James McCarthy\u2019s injury against West Brom was right in front of me and it was horrific, but you have to find a way of dealing with such accidents. \u201cTouch wood I\u2019m injury-free, but with Andr\u00e9, Jamesy and Seamus Coleman we haven\u2019t had the best of luck at Everton. Andr\u00e9 was in all our thoughts after the Spurs game but it was still worth putting an arm round Sonny and asking if he was all right. That\u2019s what football is for, I think. It\u2019s great to have team spirit and enjoy what you do for a living but you also have to be there for people when times are hard.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
