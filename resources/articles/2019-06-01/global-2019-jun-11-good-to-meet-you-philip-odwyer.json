Philip O\u2019Dwyer", "bodyText": "Hello from the majestic hills of Saddleworth, home to me, my wife and a handful of handsome stone villages nestled into the landscape of the valleys. I\u2019m a 66-year-old architect, recently retired from the practice I set up in the early 1990s. I fall into that category of people sometimes referred to as the \u201cyoung old\u201d (not to be confused with the \u201cold old\u201d\u2013 a different matter altogether!). I see this stage of life as a golden period, provided you can keep the list of ailments down to a maximum of three at any one time. I feel lucky to have the chance now to do some of the things that got squeezed out as a result of the crazy work/life balance I experienced previously. Like most people, my awareness of what\u2019s going on in the world comes from a mix of sources \u2013 and more recently this has included The Guardian Weekly. We started to subscribe when it changed to a magazine format last year. I like the mix of brief updates and the more considered pieces that can come in when the focus is not purely on breaking news. I like the graphics as well \u2013 they\u2019re clever, lively, clear and inventive."}, "isHosted": false}}}
