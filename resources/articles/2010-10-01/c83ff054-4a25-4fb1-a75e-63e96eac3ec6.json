He didn't have an easy war, and now he's not having an easy peace. It's 1950, rationing is in force, his relationship with his son is rocky, London is wreathed in smog and he is still devastated by the murder of his pregnant wife, Jenny, five years ago. The last thing he needs is to have to investigate the murder of a young woman and her baby. And it's a strange case from the outset, beginning with a telegram (remember those?) from police in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, to the effect that a John Davies has walked into their station to report the death of his wife in strange circumstances in London. It's not long before Stratton and Sergeant Ballard find the bodies of the woman and her 14-month-old child at a house that is also occupied by a rather unctuous former wartime special constable, Norman Backhouse, and his wife Edna. There are a few puzzling odds and ends, but Davies is returned to London, quickly confesses to both murders, and seems destined for a certain end on the gallows. The book is based on the notorious real-life cases of Timothy John Evans and John Reginald Halliday Christie of 10 Rillington Place, Notting Hill. Evans was hanged in 1950 for the murder of his baby, and Christie \u2013 after the discovery of six bodies at the house \u2013 faced the same fate three years later. Laura Wilson, the Guardian's crime reviewer, has stuck faithfully to the events, but has placed them very much in a novel rather than a work of history. Far more than merely putting flesh on the bones, she has created a cast of characters with sinews and thin skins, loves and dislikes, secrets and lies, who make mistakes and compound their errors; and placed them in a context so accurate that we even find traffic jams caused by lorries bringing building materials to the Festival of Britain site on London's South Bank. Wilson's ability to recreate the wartime and postwar eras is uncanny, and no doubt based on impressive research. But there is nothing dry about this history. We already know Ted Stratton well from her two previous books, Stratton's War and An Empty Death. He is a real man with a needy family in a stressed society, and you cannot help cheering him on. And the narrative is helped enormously by the parallel tale of Diane Calthrop, another veteran of previous books, who had a jolly good war working as an agent for MI5, but who is now having a really rotten peace too. She and Stratton have brushed against each other a number of times, and seem made for each other \u2013 if only the two of them would realise it. The central conundrum of the novel is, of course, as it was in real life \u2013 was the simple-minded Davies wrongly hanged for murder, given what was later found beneath the floorboards? It brings on agonies of guilt for Stratton, of course, but the author steers a careful path through the controversy. It has never been definitively established whether Evans was actually guilty of one or both of the murders \u2013 although he did, after all, confess to the crimes. I loved the way Wilson weaves the lives and dilemmas of both Stratton's daughter, Monica, and Diane Calthrop through the plot until they are both in uncomfortably vulnerable situations \u2013 and just a little too close for comfort to Norman Backhouse. This is historical crime fiction at its best."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
