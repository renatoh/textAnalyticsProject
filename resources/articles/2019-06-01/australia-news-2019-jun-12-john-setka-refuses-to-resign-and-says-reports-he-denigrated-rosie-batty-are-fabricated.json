The controversial union boss has been facing calls to quit amid claims he had criticised anti-domestic violence advocate Rosie Batty. On Wednesday, Setka said suggestions he \u201cdenigrated\u201d Batty were \u201cfabricated\u201d. But he conceded he told a union meeting that \u201claws had changed\u201d following Victoria\u2019s royal commission into family violence. The controversial union figure is also facing court over harassment charges, for which he has said he would plead guilty. Labor and union figures have declined to call for action over the harassment claims, arguing they are still before the courts. Setka declined to address what he would do if he was convicted of harassing a woman using a carriage service, saying he could not comment. He is expected to plead guilty at a hearing next month. \u201cI\u2019m elected by CFMEU construction division members, right, every four years,\u201d Setka said. \u201cThey\u2019re the people that I\u2019m beholden to and they\u2019re the ones that pay my wages and I answer to them. \u201cI don\u2019t answer to anyone else but them. So when an election comes, if they, for whatever reason, see fit to not have me as their secretary, they won\u2019t vote for me.\u201d It\u2019s understood the ACTU will argue that Setka must lose his position if a conviction is recorded. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, has already said that if \u201cany of the allegations are true\u201d, Setka should resign. But the CFMMEU state secretary is an elected position, meaning Setka cannot be removed unless he stands down or is found to have breached union rules in some way. Asked if Setka had a problem with respect for women, Walters said the answer was \u201ccategorically no\u201d. She claimed her husband was the victim of a \u201cget-John Setka campaign\u201d, though she added that \u201cboth of us have said and done things that we deeply regret and we are trying to heal, together, as a family\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m simply asking the people who are using our private lives to wage a political war against my husband, John, to stop,\u201d Walters said. On Tuesday, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said he would move to expel Setka from the party. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, backed the move, and said the government had removed Setka from an advisory board. Setka was nonplussed about his pending expulsion from the party. \u201cIf people want to expel me out of the Labor party over false accusations and over things that I\u2019ve never said, well, then, so be it,\u201d he said. He admitted telling a union meeting that lawyers had told him that laws had changed following Victoria\u2019s royal commission into family violence. The comments were made when he provided an update to the union national executive about his legal situation, Setka said. \u201cSome people told me, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t have even raised it, John. It\u2019s your own personal thing, it\u2019s nothing to do with them.\u2019\u201d Setka said. \u201cBut I wanted people to know this is where it\u2019s at and what had happened and I gave them a brief outline. Don\u2019t I regret that now?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
