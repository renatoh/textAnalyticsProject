The League Two visitors proved a test of Everton\u2019s patience and creativity but Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s side ultimately secured a third-round meeting at Fleetwood Town in comfort. Anthony Gordon, Everton\u2019s 19-year-old talent, was the only one of Ancelotti\u2019s forwards to impress against Graham Alexander\u2019s obstinate team but his performance, allied to the experience of Michael Keane and an encouraging debut from Niels Nkounkou, was sufficient to polish the hosts\u2019 dominance. Gordon created the second goal for Gylfi Sigurdsson, just when Salford were growing in confidence, and won the penalty from which Moise Kean sealed victory late on. Kean was among several Everton fringe players who failed to grasp their opportunity, however, and the watching Joey Barton, the Fleetwood manager, will have found encouragement in their toils. \u201cThe performance was good and the spirit and attitude of all the team was good,\u201d insisted the Everton manager. \u201cAnthony was inspired, in front he was really dangerous.\u201d One setback for Ancelotti was the addition of Jarrad Branthwaite to an injury list that includes fellow central defender Mason Holgate. \u201cIf there is a possibility that we find a centre-back, then we would like to do it,\u201d said the Italian, who refused to be drawn on whether Chelsea\u2019s Fikayo Tomori is the defender he has in mind. Salford\u2019s famous backers will argue otherwise but, according to Alexander, this was a monumental occasion for a League Two club facing top-flight opposition for the first time in their history. It proved a monumental step too as Premier League superiority told early on. Keane was the only survivor from Sunday\u2019s starting line-up at Tottenham as Ancelotti rotated some legs and put others in the shop window. The central defender vindicated his manager\u2019s decision by giving Everton an early lead, losing Jason Lowe and soaring above Jordan Turnbull to head Sigurdsson\u2019s corner past Vaclav Hladky. The corner was the result of an impressive burst down the left by Gordon and should have resulted in Everton doubling their lead even at that stage. Bernard had earlier picked out Theo Walcott\u2019s run into the area with an inch-perfect cross but the winger\u2019s back-header sailed over from close range. Ancelotti\u2019s changes included two full debutants in 20-year-old Portuguese goalkeeper Jo\u00e3o Virg\u00ednia and Nkounkou, the 19-year-old left-back signed from Marseille in the summer. Nkounkou impressed with his sharp passing, power and commitment to attack although, along with the rest of the Everton rearguard, his defensive prowess was rarely tested. Alexander did not come to Goodison with damage limitation in mind as his formation testified, with former Manchester United hopeful James Wilson and Brandon Thomas-Asante charged with supporting veteran marksman Ian Henderson. Everton\u2019s dominance of possession ensured opportunity was severely restricted. Kean, among those desperately needing to impress after scoring twice since arriving for an initial \u00a329m from Juventus last year, wasted a glorious chance to double Everton\u2019s lead moments after the restart. The striker was unmarked when Sigurdsson\u2019s cross sailed over the Salford defence but, with almost the entire goal to aim for, he miscued a header against the bar at close range. Bernard also squandered an excellent opening after good work by Gordon. Salford had to be patient for the chance to punish Everton\u2019s profligacy. It arrived when Ashley Hunter headed Wilson\u2019s cross into the path of Richie Towell inside the area but the midfielder blazed over from 12 yards. His disgust was audible inside the empty stadium, and said it all. Gordon forced Hladky into another good save before finally helping to banish creeping anxiety in the home ranks by creating the second for Sigurdsson. The eye-catching Nkounkou released the teenager down the left and he showed good awareness to pick out the Iceland international\u2019s late run into the area. Sigurdsson made no mistake, nor Kean from the penalty spot after Gordon had been felled by Salford substitute Bruno Andrade."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
