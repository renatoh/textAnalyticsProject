Yet, according to figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the number of UK students gaining first degrees in science, engineering and technology (SET) rose by 43% between 1994 and 2004 compared to 11% in all other subjects during the same period. Britain should be full of potential Susan Greenfields and Stephen Hawkings. But, despite the figures, SET companies in the UK are starting to recruit overseas because the pool of high-calibre science graduates in the UK is too small, says the Confederation of British Industry. That being the case, the question must be asked: where have all these bright-eyed budding scientists gone? For one thing, science graduates are abandoning their educational roots, even well after graduating, and are instead forging careers in other areas. Catherine MacDonald, who now works as a garden designer at Luciano Giubbilei Designs in London, left her research position at Rothamsted Research in Hertfordshire after two and a half years because of funding cuts. \"In 2000, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was reducing funding and the project I was working on, which had been running for 20 years, was cut,\" says the 32-year-old, who did a PhD in population genetics at Nottingham University. \"It is very difficult to get a permanent research position in my area and I realised I would be constantly moving around the country trying to follow where the work was. I just got to a point in my life where I didn't want to do that any more.\" In an attempt to stay within science, MacDonald accepted a position as an appeals secretary for a scientific charity in London. However, after finding it \"not as challenging as research\", she decided to pursue a long-held passion for art and design. \"My A-levels were split between two science and two arts subjects, so I had to make a decision about which path to choose at 18,\" she says. \"Even though I chose a scientific route I always maintained an enthusiasm for art and I missed being creative. \"When I started to question my career choice, garden design seemed like a good option and although it was difficult to give up a full-time job and enrol on a garden design course, it was the best decision I ever made.\" Clearly there are problems with funding in some areas and MacDonald says that if there had been a more secure career pathway she probably would have stayed in research. The economic importance of retaining graduates like her in the sciences is great, says Martin Taylor, vice president of the Royal Society, and more emphasis should be placed on achieving this. \"It is crucial to encourage enough science graduates to stay in science,\" he says. \"These are, after all, the people who will push forward the frontiers of knowledge and be the innovators of the future. \"While there are no simple answers, we clearly need to be addressing issues such as increasing academic salaries and improving career structures for professional scientists and engineers. But we also need to recognise that science degrees are a good preparation for a range of careers and that we benefit from having science graduates throughout our economy.\" Indeed, the transferable skills science graduates are armed with are often useful in other careers. Jenny Jacoby, 29, a human sciences graduate from University College London, works as an editor for HarperCollins Children's Books. She believes the skills taught during her degree have been invaluable to her current job. \"At university I was trained to cut through a lot of hot air and really think about the words I use, which is obviously really important in editing too,\" says Jacoby. \"My degree gave me a discipline and precision that I don't think I would have got on another course.\" Other science graduates are flourishing in publishing, adds Mary Anne Kernan, programme director of the MA in publishing studies at the City University, London. \"Scientists don't think of publishing as an avenue for them but there is work on all kinds of books which require scientific knowledge. What's more, the industry is seeking more diversity with new ideas and open minds; science graduates fit perfectly into that.\" Jenny Ungless, a career coach and director of City Life Coaching, believes science graduates should be confident they have the skills employers are looking for. \"A science degree will probably say to employers that you are quite analytical, have good attention to detail and have a good grasp of complex issues,\" she says. Nevertheless, Ungless warns that a career change can be difficult for people who have invested a lot of time into their particular subject. \"However, whatever you are trained in will help you in your next career so try not to think of that time as a waste.\" While science graduates seem to be looking elsewhere, CBI figures estimate that by 2014 the UK will need to have found 2.4 million new people to meet the demand for chemists, physicists, engineers and lab technicians. \"Industry is trying to up its game where it can, and in the last couple of years figures have shown that science graduate starting salaries have increased quite a lot,\" says Adam Powell, a CBI spokesman. \"The government is also aware of the problem and are trying to address it, but we would say they need to speed up and increase their efforts before the UK gets left behind.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
