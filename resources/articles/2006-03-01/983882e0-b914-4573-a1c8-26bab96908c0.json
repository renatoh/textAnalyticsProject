The 33-year-old man barricaded the pupils, a teacher and two teaching assistants into a classroom at a school in western France where he lost his job two years ago. Reuters said the man, who staff said was depressed when he lost his job, had made demands to talk to the media and former education minister Francois Fillon about his inability to find work. Bernadette Mercier, a receptionist, said he appeared calm and \"looked normal\" as he entered the school in the town of Sable-sur-Sarthe, which is around 27 miles from Le Mans, at about 2:30 pm local time (1330 GMT). He then pulled out a handgun and barricaded the staff and pupils, aged between 16 and 18, into an upper-floor study hall at the Colbert de Torcy High School. Armed police took up positions in the school and nearby buildings and an elite counter-terrorism squad was dispatched to the scene. At around 7.30pm, police said the hostage crisis had ended and the man had surrendered. Ms Mercier said the man had been unemployed since losing his job at the school. Speaking before he gave himself up, she said he had promised not to harm the students and was talking to the teaching staff. She said he had been \"very, very depressed\" two years ago because of personal problems and now was apparently seeking work. \"We knew him, so we simply let him in,\" Ms Mercier said. \"He seemed totally normal.\" A crisis centre for parents was set up on the school grounds. The school has around 1,600 pupils, and about 300 of them boarders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
