Roberto Mancini's team were knocked out of the Europa League by Sporting Lisbon on Thursday evening after drawing their last-16 tie 3-3 on aggregate and being eliminated on away goals. As Manchester United were also knocked out, by Athletic Bilbao, both clubs can focus solely on the league with Sir Alex Ferguson's men leading City by a point. Tevez could well feature for the club in the crucial match with Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday for the first time since late September following a falling out with Mancini for refusing to warm up for a Champions League game at Bayern Munich. But despite Tevez's differences with City Tour\u00e9 said: \"It would be great if he could play against Chelsea because he's got a great record against them. I would love it if he scored the goal to win us the title because for me he's a great player. A problem can happen but his quality is still there. It's great to have him in the squad again. He can score goals and he's a strong player. \"We all know Carlos, he's quality. I think he's going to be a big lift for us to have a player like him. Now he's back and he can play it will be great to have him, especially at this time.\" Tevez and his Argentinian compatriot Sergio Ag\u00fcero could form a formidable partnership, Tour\u00e9 believes: \"For sure. We have great strikers. We just need now to show our commitment and give 100% from the first minute to the last minute,\" he said. \"We didn't give 100% in the first half [against Lisbon]. In the second half the manager told us to show a bit more. We needed to do it because it is the second time now. At Swansea [when losing 1-0 on Sunday] we played the first half not very good and against Lisbon the first half wasn't good. \"I don't know why we are doing that. It must be the mentality. The season is very long, there is a lot of pressure. Maybe it is that. But there is no excuse. We are footballers and we knew this season would be difficult. The most difficult time is now because we are closer to the end of the season and the most important games are now. But tonight we didn't do enough defensively.\" After being 2-0 down at half-time against Lisbon, City staged an impressive comeback to win the leg 3-2 and Tour\u00e9 is clear this can prove the inspiration for their title charge. \"That showed we have some great quality in there. We just need to show that from the first minute because if we play like we did in those last 30 minutes, nobody can stop us,\" he said. \"We need to do that from the first minute. High concentration, that is important. If we play like we did in the first 45 minutes, we won't win the league. But if we play like we did in the last 30, we can,\" he said. Do the players believe they can win the title? \"Yes, of course, because we have been leading this Premier League for six months and we can't give up now. We just need to believe. It's going to be massive for the club. It's going to be a dream come true for City after what everybody put into this club. We just need to give everything we have and show character.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
