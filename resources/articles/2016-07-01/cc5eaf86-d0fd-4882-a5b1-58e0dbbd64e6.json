The Republican presidential nominee responded to a serious accusation of plagiarism in his campaign this week by tweeting that \u201call press is good press\u201d. At an event introducing Indiana governor Mike Pence as his running mate, Trump used the opportunity to talk about himself. And in a brutally awkward 60 Minutes interview, Trump uttered the words: \u201cI\u2019m much more humble than you would understand.\u201d (The most humble man in the world! The universe!) With a worldview in which only you and your desires matter, it\u2019s not just easier to take what you want \u2013 it\u2019s second nature. And so listening to Jill Harth, the woman who brought a lawsuit against Donald Trump almost 20 years ago alleging sexual assault, I wasn\u2019t surprised. Harth\u2019s allegations \u2013 that Trump made repeated unwanted sexual advances, that he groped her and, on one occasion, pulled her into a bedroom, pushed her against a wall and touched her \u201cprivate parts\u201d \u2013 tell a familiar story of a man believing he should have anything he wants. \u201cHe was aggressive,\u201d Harth said. \u201cAnd he has a sense of entitlement and he thinks everybody\u2019s in love with him, every woman.\u201d And that\u2019s the crux of it: Trump\u2019s entitlement problem. He appears to think he\u2019s entitled to women\u2019s bodies: whether to grope them, judge them or legislate them. Hundreds of lawsuits and other filings suggest he thinks he\u2019s entitled to stiff small businesses, apparently paying what and when he wants regardless of promises made. He thinks he\u2019s entitled to take credit for his children\u2019s accomplishments and call himself a good father, even though he scoffs at the idea of parenting. \u201cI won\u2019t do anything to take care of them,\u201d he said in a 2005 radio interview. \u201cI\u2019ll supply funds and she\u2019ll take care of the kids. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to be walking the kids down to Central Park.\u201d Yes, surely we wouldn\u2019t expect that. Trump thinks he\u2019s entitled to unquestioning loyalty, even from Harth \u2013 who didn\u2019t publicly comment on her lawsuit for almost 20 years after withdrawing it. Worst of all, Trump thinks he\u2019s entitled to our votes: ignoring questions he doesn\u2019t like, lying with impunity, and invoking hatred and bigotry at every step of his campaign. This is a man who believes he deserves everything, and that he has to answer for nothing. Harth says she came forward now because of her reputation; that she doesn\u2019t like Trump and his daughter Ivanka suggesting she\u2019s a liar. We know how this story goes. She will be attacked and called names. Trump will meet the accusations with a shrug. Women who make accusations against powerful men are dragged into the muck; powerful men can get $40m safety nets. When someone feels entitled, convincing them that their wants are not paramount is difficult. With Trump I\u2019d guess that it\u2019s near impossible. A man who cannot see past the end of his nose, who thinks the world revolves around him and his needs, cannot be trusted to do what\u2019s best for other people. A man like that cannot be president."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
