Amid a slew of new pledges were proposals ranging from seizing control of credit rating agencies to turn them into not-for-profits, capping credit card and ATM fees, and preventing banks from earning interest on deposits made at the Federal Reserve. Declaring that the \u201cbusiness model of Wall Street is fraud\u201d, the Democratic presidential hopeful also fleshed out longstanding promises to jail bank executives and introduce a sweeping new transaction tax on speculation. \u201cGreed, fraud, dishonesty and arrogance, these are the words that best describe the reality of Wall Street today,\u201d Sanders told supporters in midtown Manhattan. \u201cTo those on Wall Street who may be listening today, let me be very clear. Greed is not good. In fact, the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric of our nation.\u201d The uncompromising language is a familiar feature of the Vermont senator\u2019s fiery stump speech, but Tuesday\u2019s address included detailed policy proposals for the first time, some of which suggest he would use executive actions rather than wait to achieve consensus in Congress before acting if elected to the White House. Within 100 days of taking office, Sanders said he would require the Treasury Department to compile a \u201cToo-Big-to-Fail list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout\u201d. These, he claimed, would then be broken up within a year under existing authority granted to the president under Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Vermont senator also stepped up his previously guarded criticism of frontrunner Hillary Clinton, ridiculing her claims to be tough on Wall Street reform and quoting the former labor secretary Rob Reich blasting the secretary of state for \u201cfinagling\u201d on the subject. \u201cMy opponent says that, as a senator, she told bankers to \u2018cut it out\u2019 and end their destructive behavior,\u201d teased Sanders. \u201cBut, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to \u2018cut it out\u2019.\u201d Earlier in the campaign, Sanders pulled an attack ad accusing Clinton of selling out to Wall Street donors, but his promise to avoid negative campaigning appeared further strained as he reminded the audience of her large speaking fees from bank appearances. \u201cMy opponent, Secretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall [bank reform] would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits. Secretary Clinton is wrong,\u201d he claimed, pointing to the role of traditional banks in financing the riskiest lending. \u201cSecretary Clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry. I disagree,\u201d he added. Though Sanders has long stressed that his version of \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d should not be seen as wanting to nationalise industries, he also pledged to turn multibillion-dollar credit rating agencies such as Moody\u2019s, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s and Fitch into not-for-profit institutions that would have exclusive power to assess the health of corporate debt. \u201cWe cannot have a safe and sound financial system if we cannot trust the credit agencies to accurately rate financial products,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, the only way we can restore that trust is to make sure credit rating agencies cannot make a profit from Wall Street.\u201d And the senator listed half a dozen prominent cases where he says bank executives unfairly escaped prosecution, claiming it was an outrage that banks had been fined $204bn since 2009 but no one had gone to jail. Sanders also called for a national \u201cusury law\u201d to regulate interest rates charges by lenders. \u201cThe Bible has a term for this practice. It\u2019s called usury. And in The Divine Comedy, Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell for those who charged people usurious interest rates,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, we don\u2019t need the hellfire and the pitchforks, we don\u2019t need the rivers of boiling blood, but we do need a national usury law.\u201d Many of these measures would cause palpations in the business community if ever enacted but mirror the demands of campaigners for financial justice who came to prominence after the 2008 banking crash in so-called Occupy protests across the world. Though Sanders continues to trail Clinton by a large margin in national opinion polls, his top advisers insisted they were \u201cwell positioned\u201d in both the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primaries, during a separate briefing call for reporters. \u201cIf elected president, I will rein in Wall Street so they can\u2019t crash our economy again,\u201d concluded Sanders in his speech. \u201cWill they like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I\u2019m president? You better believe it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
