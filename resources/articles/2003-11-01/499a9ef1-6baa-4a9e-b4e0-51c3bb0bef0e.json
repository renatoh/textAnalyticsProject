On this disturbing evidence not even the Bahrain billionaire and long-time Leeds supporter Sheikh Abdul din Mubarak Al-Khalifa, said to be ready to inject \u00a365m, and the insertion of the canniest new manager will guarantee Leeds' safety from the horrors of relegation. Gray, however brief his caretakership, deserves every sympathy and backing for his latest loyal gesture. There was no sympathy from Bolton, pursuing their own anti-relegation agenda, who were happy to shut up shop early on after the gift of two goals in a minute, as Sam Allardyce candidly admitted. It was only his team's third win and they will not have an easier one all season. Jay-Jay Okocha and Ivan Campo looked bored. The Nigerian and Spaniard do not suggest the pedigree for the graft and grit of relegation struggles. Yet they are integral to Allardyce's security planning, from which Leeds can learn a lot. \"I had exactly what Leeds have got now - we were in the bottom three in December last year - because of the influx of seven or eight players,\" said Allardyce. \"It takes time to come together. And only three games ago we had what looked like a desperate situation. \"The turning point last season was getting in three players in January. We had kept only four clean sheets up to then. But we have acquired quality as well. Players like Okocha and Campo will always start attacks.\" Even though Gray selected a more recognisable Leeds team - Mark Viduka, David Batty and Ian Harte were restored - Allardyce was mindful of the need to motivate new and established players. \"Without question man management is 80% of the job and coaching 20%. To get the maximum out of your players every week is hard.\" In a reference to Leeds' own foreign contingent, it was vital \"getting them to understand that it's English football, and not where they came from\". This was Allardyce's 200th game in charge of Bolton. Gray had almost that number during his three-year reign after Leeds' last relegation, in 1982. Of his future he knows \"not a thing, no one's said anything. I just get on with it but I'm enjoying being among it.\" His words sometimes told a different story. \"There's definitely a lack of confidence as a unit. The players were buoyant in training and I expected a better performance. But it never materialised. Whoever comes in here it's going to be a hard task for them. It's an attraction, this club, but it will be hard to get results.\" Leeds lost Alan Smith to suspension and Gary Kelly to injury on Saturday but the problems run much deeper - right to the heart of defence. Here dramatic surgery is needed rapidly. Leeds have conceded 12 goals in the last three games and the latest two were shockers. Michael Duberry was the culprit for the first, heading Ricardo Gardner's cross straight to Kevin Davies, who shot home from 12 yards at leisure. At least four Leeds players shared the blame for the second as they allowed Davies to cross for Stelios Giannakopoulos to stroke in. The returning Viduka, despite suffering flu last week, was in one of his livelier moods and offered the only genuine threat to Bolton, seeing a header from the impressive 17-year-old James Milner and a jabbed shot blocked with difficulty by Jussi Jaaskelainen.
