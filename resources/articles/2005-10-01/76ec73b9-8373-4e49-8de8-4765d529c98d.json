The London firm supplies more than 25m sandwiches a year to coffee bars and has \"significant capacity\" to expand. Greencore also confirmed the sale of its pizza subsidiary, which went to a management firm for a \"nominal consideration\" after failing to deliver the expected results, and its food business Feldhues, which produces deli-style meat products and went to a Dutch private investment group for \u00a36m. The group said the pizza sale would lead to a \u00a324m hit in its results."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
