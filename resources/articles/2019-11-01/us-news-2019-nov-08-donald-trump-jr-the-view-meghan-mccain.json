They also invited Trump Jr\u2019s girlfriend \u2013 because in today\u2019s political landscape, even the most tenuous link to fame or power seems as good a credential as any for being worthy of a platform. It wasn\u2019t long before the chatshow descended into chaos. Soon, McCain and Trump Jr were in a very contentious battle over whose dad was bigger than whose \u2013 McCain pointing out that Trump said mean things about her dad; Trump Jr pointing out that his dad had Made America Great Again. It was low blows from then on, thrown from all sides. A discussion started about how President Trump has stooped to lower levels of moral decency than any other president, for example, by boasting about sexually assaulting women and calling Mexicans rapists. If the title of Trump Jr\u2019s new book is anything to go by (Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us), to start a fight over political correctness was probably his aim. And that is exactly what happened. If we\u2019re going to talk about bringing down the discourse, Trump Jr retorted, perhaps we should talk about the time that Joy Behar \u2013 another host on the show \u2013 wore blackface. (In 2016, Behar joked about her \u201ccostume\u201d on TV, saying she was dressed as a \u201cbeautiful African woman\u201d and admitted to darkening her skin). And what about the time that the co-host Whoopi Goldberg, he continued, invented the term \u201cnot rape-rape\u201d to describe Roman Polanski\u2019s alleged drugging and rape of a 13-year-old child? The ensuing pile-on must have been music to his ears: throughout the show, the hosts talked over him a number of times; at one point Behar chastised the audience for cheering him (\u201cthis isn\u2019t a Maga rally!\u201d she said). This all made for perfectly predictable viral content: people shared videos of Trump Jr calling the two out. \u201cGuess you could say I just #Triggered The View!!\u201d exclaimed Trump Jr online. The irony of a man justifying his father\u2019s alleged sexual assaults by talking about his accomplishments, then criticizing Goldberg for defending Polanski is not lost on me. But if the point of his book is to suggest that cancel culture and no-platforming are examples of the unforgiving, righteous nature of the left, then here it is. The hosts found themselves in a double bind. If Behar and Goldberg were to defend themselves, what could they say? That it was a different time? That they have changed? Trump Jr would just ask for equal forgiveness for his father. If they don\u2019t have an answer to his attacks, the implicit question stands: shouldn\u2019t Behar and Goldberg be cancelled already? Neither Behar nor Goldberg have ever fully apologized, and Goldberg has used her platform to make excuses for her friend Mel Gibson, who was caught on tape spewing racist comments. Clearly, they are flawed. But no one \u2013 not even people on the left \u2013 is born with fully formed progressive views. People make mistakes. That doesn\u2019t mean we should shrug and say we therefore shouldn\u2019t aspire to any moral compass \u2013 which is what it seems Trump Jr is trying to do. Nor does it excuse Behar, Goldberg or Trump Jr \u2013 they clearly each need to reflect on their own positions, perhaps privately \u2013 before subjecting us to this on live TV. But it does mean that progressives are sometimes too eager to call for people\u2019s heads. As for the rest of us? We should be triggered by a president who locks children in cages, and who equates leftwing protest with \u201calt-right\u201d hate crimes. He is the president: we have a right to criticize harmful policy. Plus, we couldn\u2019t cancel him even if we tried. But we need to stop making it so easy for him to get to us. His fans will be brimming with glee at his son\u2019s performance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
