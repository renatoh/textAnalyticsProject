To say Al Dardour single-handedly destroyed Palestine with his four-goal haul wouldn\u2019t quite be true as he couldn\u2019t have done it without the unceasing generosity of the opposing \u201cdefence\u201d (note we\u2019ve used speech marks just to cover ourselves under the trades description act). But woeful marking shouldn\u2019t take the gloss off Al Dardour\u2019s superb one-man show and the first hat-trick of this year\u2019s tournament. It was a pure goal poacher\u2019s performance, with three of the strikes coming from tap-ins after perfectly timed runs into the box. And as Keisuke Honda unfortunately proved for Japan in the night\u2019s other game, there\u2019s no such thing as an easy tap-in. Even E Honda from Streetfighter II could have put that one away. Photo of the day Something to cheer Your team is five goals down with five minutes to go. Asian Cup oblivion isn\u2019t just staring you in the face, it\u2019s put its thumb on its nose and is waggling its fingers. With the game wrapped up in their favour, a bored-looking Jordan defence let a deep free-kick into the box elude them and Palestine\u2019s Jaka Ihbeisheh fires home at the back post. It\u2019s a late consolation on an otherwise humiliating night. Yet instead of a polite round of applause or ironic cheers to greet the players\u2019 muted celebrations, the crowd directly behind the goal erupts into a flag-waving frenzy of joy uncontained. Despite successive hammerings, it\u2019s Palestine\u2019s first ever Asian Cup goal and their fans want to show the tournament\u2019s underdogs just how much it means to them. Even this old cynic cracked a smile. What we learned With so much attention on the Socceroos\u2019 superb start to the tournament, it\u2019s easy to ignore (or just convenient) how the Asian Cup\u2019s \u201cother\u201d favourites are faring. Japan thumped Palestine 4-0 in the opening round, but last night\u2019s confident display against Iraq was a more ominous sign of their credentials. There\u2019s a shark lurking in that sea of deep blue shirts, and last night\u2019s game was the first couple of notes from the Jaws theme. What\u2019s on today It\u2019s the big one: Kuwait v Oman. But few football fans realise there\u2019s another game on tonight, with the all-conquering Socceroos set to face their first serious test of the tournament. South Korea have qualified for the knock-out stages too, but whereas Ange Postecoglou\u2019s players have steamrollered their way there, their opponents\u2019 progress has resembled a second-hand Hyundai with just enough gas in the tank to reach the finish line. Top of the group glory awaits the victor, a probable semi-final against Japan befalls the loser. Video of the day What\u2019s happening in the Socceroos camp? Ange Postecoglou has promised not to ease off on his side\u2019s attack-minded philosophy, despite the step up in class of the opposition and the fact the Socceroos only need a draw to top the group. \u201cEveryone is aware of what our approach has been and what it will continue to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a game of football to be played and every time that happens we want to win it - that won\u2019t change (tonight). We improved from the first game to the second and we want that again in the third game.\u201d Meanwhile, question marks still hover over the fitness of Mile Jedinak due to an ankle injury. Player to watch Nam Tae-Hee. After not even featuring in the opening game against Oman, injuries and illness meant the 23-year-old was given a starting role in the follow-up against Kuwait. He seized his chance in style, hitting the winner to seal South Korea\u2019s place in the next round. Despite being tipped as a potential star in his younger days, Nam has never really lived up to the hype. This tournament was seen as a chance for him to finally make his name. Another good performance against the Socceroos would do just that. Quote of the day I appreciate your concern mate, usually no one cares about how I feel. No we won\u2019t be rotating coaches, I\u2019ll be fit for tomorrow. A surprised Ange Postecoglou after being quizzed about a bug he\u2019s picked up. Must read this Pete Smith\u2019s interview with Socceroos defender Alex Wilkinson about a more physically robust South Korean side, and his fifteen-year relationship with the gaffer Postecoglou.
