Liverpool's players left Stamford Bridge after Wednesday's goalless draw seething at what they considered a theatrical dive by the Iceland international. The Merseysiders' fury was exacerbated by the claim that Gudjohnsen then taunted Alonso over the booking, his response adding to the tension growing before the return leg. Alonso was enraged by the Chelsea forward's reaction to a seemingly innocuous challenge just inside the home half three minutes from time - there appeared to be minimal contact between the pair before Gudjohnsen fell to the turf - and pursued his opponent to remonstrate. His protests were laughed off by the striker, who allegedly retorted that he had been well aware Alonso was on the brink of a suspension. The yellow card shown by the French referee Alain Sars was Alonso's third of the competition, earning him an automatic one-match ban. Gudjohnsen was quick to deny afterwards that he had deliberately sought to have the Liverpool midfielder booked and he then attempted to quell the furore by suggesting the card had been harsh. \"Sure, he [Alonso] is disappointed to have been shown a yellow card, but it was not my decision, it was the referee's decision,\" said the 26-year-old. \"I would never try and get a fellow professional booked. It is not something I would seek to do and, believe me, I can understand his disappointment. It is a shame for him that he has to miss the next game, but Liverpool have to deal with it. It is one of those things. I didn't think Joe Cole's booking was a foul either. \"If they want to appeal, I'm a Chelsea player. What can I do about it?\" Uefa has since confirmed that Liverpool cannot appeal, with Sars unlikely to reverse his decision. \"I went up to the referee at the end and said: 'What about that booking?'\" said the Liverpool manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez. \"He just asked which one and shrugged his shoulders as though he didn't know what I was talking about. \"I asked our club secretary straight away whether there was any way we could appeal but the referee has to change his mind, and he is never going to do that.\" The possibility that Chelsea may have to do without both Damien Duff and Arjen Robben for next week's second leg - the Irishman is still suffering from a tight hamstring and the Dutch international took a knock on his ankle - will be of little consolation to either Ben\u00edtez or Alonso. The Spain international missed almost four months of this season after a challenge by Chelsea's Frank Lampard broke his ankle during the New Year's Day Premiership fixture. He must now sit out again, hoping his team-mates can reach the Champions League final in his absence. \"You can see on the replay that I didn't touch the player,\" said Alonso. \"When I saw the yellow card I couldn't believe it because I knew what it meant. I feel so sad to be missing the second leg because it would be a special night at Anfield. Now I just hope we can get through to the final so I have a chance of playing again. That would mean so much to me.\" The Spaniard was inconsolable in the dressing room at Stamford Bridge, with his team-mates pledging to secure passage to the final in Istanbul next month in his absence. \"He was distraught after the game and I feel for him because I know how much he wanted to play in what will be a massive game at Anfield,\" said Steven Gerrard, who had had an abscess drained at a London hospital before Wednesday's game. \"That is a definitely a motivation for everyone, to get through so that Xabi will be able to play in the final. \"It was a harsh decision and no one can believe he has got a yellow card for it. He is immense for us, but we will try and do it for him. We'll need brave men on Tuesday - 11 gladiators. Everyone will have to be ready.\" \"What happened has made us all the more determined to make sure we finish the job at Anfield for Xabi,\" said the goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. \"He looked distraught and the whole mood went quiet even though we had played so well and come away with a good result. We all really felt for him. He was so down, visibly upset, and those were difficult moments for us all. We will try and do it for him and make sure there is a Champions League final for him to look forward to. That would be the perfect answer.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
