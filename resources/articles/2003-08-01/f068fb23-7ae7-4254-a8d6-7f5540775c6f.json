To get his crown, Bekele had to beat Haile Gebrselassie, the double Olympic and four-time world champion and the mangenerally recognised as the best distance runner in history. Bekele overtook his illustrious team-mate 180 metres out and sped home for victory in 26min 49.57sec, with Gebrselassie taking silver and Sileshi Sihine the bronze medal. The race was almost a celebration of Ethiopian distance running. If the Kenyans thought they could put up some resistance they were rudely disabused of the notion. For most of the last quarter of the race it was Gebrselassie cutting out the pace and it told on Sihine. Bekele, though, was always comfortable. So much so that one wonders if the 21-year-old is about to establish a hegemony of his own: \"I am Haile's successor and it is a wonderful feeling,\" said Bekele. With the Olympic champion Marion Jones absent, and the lack of form shown by the reigning champion, Zhanna Block, the women's 100m was anything but cut and dried. Kelli White, though, has made progress all season and stamped her authority in her semi-final, winning in 10.96. In the final White looked imperious, putting daylight between herself and the rest from halfway. White's time of 10.85 was a personal best and Jones, who was in the crowd, will know she has a job on her hands when she returns. Torri Edwards, also from the US, took the silver medal, and Block, from the Ukraine, the bronze. Kelly Holmes qualified for the final of the 800m, seemingly with a little help from her friend. Racing in the second of the three semi-finals, Holmes surged into the lead 150 metres out with the world and Olympic champion Maria Mutola on her shoulder. For the last 120 metres Mutola, who regularly trains with Holmes, ran alongside urging her mate on. There was no such joy for Daniel Caines, though, who drew the same 400m semi-final as Tyree Washington. Caines finished third but, with only two going through, had to rely on his time of 45.29, and it was nowhere near quick enough. Washington was easily the fastest qualifier and behaved as if the title was already his. It will be come tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
