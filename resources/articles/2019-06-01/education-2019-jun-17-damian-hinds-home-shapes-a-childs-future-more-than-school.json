Damian Hinds described the issue as \u201cthe last taboo in public policy\u201d, and added that \u201cwhat parents do is actually more important than who your parents are\u201d in an unscripted speech addressed to people involved in education on Monday. Speaking before a Tory leadership election and with a cabinet reshuffle looming, Hinds said growing up in households where arguments were frequent and parents were disengaged from their children\u2019s education had the effect of nine grades at GCSE level on a child\u2019s attainment. He used the event to announce a package of measures from the Department for Education, including the launch of a programme in July \u201cwhich isn\u2019t going to be patronising and lecturing\u201d to advise parents on how to create a better learning environment at home. \u201cNobody wants to be the politician that starts talking about \u2018well you should do this and you should do that\u2019 or make it sound like they know better than a family and I don\u2019t want to be that person either,\u201d said Hinds. \u201cBut, if we are serious about social mobility we have to go there, we have to care about the home learning environment because it is going to determine the futures of a lot of those children.\u201d Other measures announced on Monday included a plan to ensure new teachers in England are trained in how to spot early warning signs of mental illness, better sharing of information between councils and schools and tackling absence and exclusions. In light of a government review published on Monday, Hinds also said school admissions codes would be changed to speed up school moves for vulnerable children \u2013 such as domestic abuse victims. Responding to Hinds\u2019 announcement, Anntoinette Bramble, a councillor and chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s children and young people board, said: \u201cSchools and councils are both struggling with insufficient budgets, which makes it increasingly difficult to give children the support they need to thrive. \u201cCouncils face an \u00a38bn funding gap by 2025, while an additional \u00a31.6bn is required in high-needs funding by 2021. It is essential that government uses the forthcoming spending review to address these shortfalls, and to ensure schools are adequately funded to support all children to achieve their ambitions.\u201d In a bid to shore up her \u201clegacy\u201d, it has been reported that the outgoing prime minister, Theresa May, is also attempting to add an extra \u00a327bn to the education budget. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said: \u201cAlthough many of these measures are positive and welcome, sooner or later the government will have to recognise that without decent levels of basic funding for schools and public services, the hard work and positive ideas of so many will simply go to waste. \u201cWe desperately need new money from the Treasury for schools and children\u2019s services, or children will continue to be failed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
