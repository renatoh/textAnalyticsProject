The actor, 84, played schoolmistress Minerva McGonagall in the boy-wizard films and the waspish Violet Crawley in the period drama. Discussing the earlier years of her career, she told ES magazine: \u201cIt seemed to take ages to get away from light comedy.\u201d She added: \u201cI am deeply grateful for the work in Potter and indeed Downton, but it wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call satisfying. I didn\u2019t really feel I was acting in those things.\u201d Smith returned to the stage this year as Joseph Goebbels\u2019 secretary in the Christopher Hampton one-woman play A German Life. She said that as soon as she agreed to do it, she suffered \u201cdoubt, doubt, doubt\u201d. \u201cI suddenly felt twice as old as I actually was,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd also, when you haven\u2019t done a show for a long time, there\u2019s something pretty dumb about doing it totally on your own.\u201d The long-awaited Downton Abbey movie made almost $200m on release earlier this year, with home entertainment numbers expected to be healthy. Smith was reported to be on of the last cast members to agree to the feature film; her involvement would also be key to any sequel. Speaking about the possibility of a followup last week, one of the film\u2019s producers, Graham Neame, confirmed there is a potential film in the works. \u201cWe\u2019re working on what the story is,\u201d he said, \u201cand when we might be able to make it. \u201cBut it\u2019s the same as the first time around: we have to try and get everyone back together again. And that was very challenging.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
