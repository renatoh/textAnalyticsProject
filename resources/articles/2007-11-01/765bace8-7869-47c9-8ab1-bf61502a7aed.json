Sudoku might be a number grid, they soothed, but don't let all those nasty ones, twos and threes frighten you, because you don't need to be any good at maths to do it. It was a message that summed up the national attitude to maths. Numbers are something inherently difficult, to be feared and mistrusted. The subject carries a lasting memory of childhood shame and frustration from which we never recover. Maths is for geeks, nerds and misfits; the rest of us get by on a wing, a prayer and a calculator. Andrew Hodges, maths lecturer at Wadham College, Oxford, takes a different view of the addictive puzzle. \"Sudoku may not require long multiplication or division,\" he says, \"but it is a very good puzzle that replicates the pattern of thinking required to solve quite complex logical problems in maths. But no one dares mention the association, for fear of putting off all those who like doing it.\" Hodges has spent a lot of time thinking about these sorts of contradictions over the past year while writing One to Nine: The Inner Life of Numbers, his contribution to the growing catalogue of books that aim to make high-brow maths user-friendly for middle-brow arty types. It has to be said that, like many other authors before him, Hodges is only partially successful. You can be reading quite happily for several paragraphs, enjoying the feeling of a new world opening up, and then he loses you in a sentence. And no matter how often you re-read that sentence, you're still none the wiser. You have come up against a barrier of understanding that language cannot easily transcend. In chapter nine, for example, Hodges states: \"By about 20 [years old], it is possible to catch up with current knowledge in one small area - for instance, in the heartland of mystery and discovery to which elliptic functions are the doorway.\" Hodges laughs: \"Even when I was writing the book, I knew that it was part folly because, for almost all readers, it was going to be an exercise in alienation just to pick it up.\" Worst subject He explains: \"Most people seem to remember maths as their worst subject and have developed a mental block about it. So there will be a lot of areas about which they know nothing. Everyone who tries to popularise maths understands they are going to come up against this, but most choose to ignore it and carry on regardless. I felt it was important to address this barrier between writer and reader head on.\" Which is easier said than done, when you realise just how limited many people's maths often is. Only last week, Camelot had to withdraw one of its scratchcards when loads of punters complained that they couldn't understand why -9 was a lower number than -8. For Hodges, the real battleground is the syllabus at key stages 3 and 4, where the ante gets upped from relatively straightforward maths to something altogether more complicated: an uneasy hybrid of the Athenian Euclidian abstract logic that was so appealing to the Victorian gentry, and the relentless grind of long calculation that has its roots in the pre-computer era when bosses needed clerks to keep books and ledgers with metronomic accuracy. \"There still needs to be a syllabus that stretches the most able and provides them with a route on to A-level and university,\" he says. \"But I think we should consider abandoning it as a compulsory subject. What's the point in a system that brands all those who don't get a maths GCSE as failures? All it does is reinforce their sense that maths is boring and difficult, which is the last thing we should be doing.\" He would like to see a change of approach. \"We should be trying to find ways of equipping children with the basic maths they will need to function adequately in society. I'm sure there are wonderful examples of good teaching practice to be found in schools, but the curriculum is very prescriptive and most teachers don't have the time to be creative. We should be looking at ways of teaching maths skills through other media, such as electronic music and web design, that are more relevant to most students.\" Hodges is by no means the first person to suggest a radical overhaul of maths at secondary level. At the request of the government for a rethink of post-14 maths, Professor Adrian Smith, principal of Queen Mary, University of London, published Making Mathematics Count in 2004, which branded the GCSE as \"not fit for purpose\" and suggested doing away with the three-tier system of higher, intermediate and foundation GCSEs. \"It is crazy to have a system whereby the highest grade in the foundation paper is a D,\" he said. \"What incentive is there for anyone to try when they are guaranteed to fail?\" Smith also promoted the idea of functional maths for the less able - maths that would equip students with basic numeric skills, such as percentages, measurement and estimation - and called for more teachers and better continuing professional development. Charles Clarke, then education secretary, accepted these proposals wholeheartedly and the maths world sat back and waited for the promised land. Barely a squeak It hasn't really come. There have been a few bright signs - the creation of a National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics, and a scheduled switch to a two-tier GCSE. But there's been barely a squeak from Celia Hoyles, the government's maths tsar, in the past few years and the introduction of functional maths, the key component to the reforms in most people's opinion, has been rather fudged. \"It has all gone a bit quiet,\" says David Benjamin, a maths teacher at Folkestone academy in Kent. \"We've seen a model that incorporates elements of functional maths into the GCSE curriculum, but there's been no sign of a separate qualification.\" Inevitably, this means that some pupils are being forced to study ideas that are beyond them, and teachers cannot do much about it. \"A lot of kids have been getting very negative messages about maths since they were born,\" Benjamin says, \"from their parents who themselves struggled with maths, and from school. Maths can seem quite unforgiving. You can have something explained several times and still not really understand it, and when this happens, it's easy to think you are stupid. So our first aim is to build up the students' confidence.\" But teachers have to get through a packed syllabus at a steady pace; they can't keep going over the material until everyone in the class has grasped it. What's more, some kids are never going to understand all the concepts, particularly in algebra, not because they are stupid, but because they aren't at the necessary level of abstract cognitive development. Yet they have to be taught it regardless. The consequences are all too predictable; failure breeds more failure and disengagement generates greater disengagement. Paul Ernest, a professor at Exeter University's school of education and lifelong learning, argues that traditional teaching methods disadvantage ethnic minority pupils, girls, students with special needs and those from poor backgrounds, and that considerations of social responsibility should be applied to maths teaching. \"I disagree with people who think that mathematics is neutral and value-free,\" he says. \"It is human made, therefore culturally influenced, and this makes social justice central and relevant in mathematics. \"We need to think of different ways of contextualising maths to take multi-culturalism, racism and sexism into account. Students need to see that everyone owns maths, and that many countries have had their roles in the development of the subject downplayed. We need to make maths more democratic and discursive, so they are not afraid to suggest wrong answers.\" As Ernest readily accepts, this last suggestion demands a total rethink of teaching styles, as one of the main problems students come across in maths is precisely that an answer is simply either right or wrong. And it's hard to get round that. Whereas an essay can allow for shades of opinion and degrees of understanding, most school - and even undergraduate - maths doesn't throw the subject open to these nuances. A great deal to learn \"I think mathematicians have a great deal to learn from other disciplines,\" Hodges says, \"and I would like to see more emphasis on making judgmental assessments. This is a key skill, especially when dealing with human problems, but it's not one that mathematicians seem to learn, even at undergraduate level.\" Maths remains a very particular animal, and one that politicians are reluctant to tamper with. There's no denying there have been improvements: the numbers taking GCSE and A-level maths have risen and there are more teachers. But the less able are still struggling, mainly because politicians worry it would be electoral suicide to introduce a separate functional maths GCSE. They can squeeze a bit of functional maths into the existing system and shave off a bit of the more difficult stuff elsewhere, but going the whole hog is somehow just too radical, inviting accusations of dumbing down. So for the time being, instead of learning something functional, the less able will continue to learn next to nothing. \u00b7 Order One To Nine: The Inner Life of Numbers for \u00a311.99 with free UK p&amp;p at theguardian.com/bookshop, or call 0870 836 0875"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
