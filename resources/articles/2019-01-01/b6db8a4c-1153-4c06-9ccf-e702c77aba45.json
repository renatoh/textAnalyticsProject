The Grimsby manager had just seen his defender Andrew Fox dismissed \u2013 with a little help from the video assistant referee \u2013 for a poor tackle on Andros Townsend and faced the prospect of playing almost the entire match against Premier League opposition with 10 men. But having been to the wilderness of the National League and back since they last visited Selhurst Park in 2003, Grimsby are made of stern stuff and it took until the 86th minute for their resolve finally to be broken, by the substitute Jordan Ayew\u2019s header from Jeffrey Schlupp\u2019s free-kick. For Jolley, the former investment banker who began his coaching career at Palace\u2019s academy, it was a cruel way to lose but he will be extremely proud of the way his side stuck to their task after such an early setback, with James McKeown making a string of excellent saves to frustrate the hosts. \u201cThe result is incredibly disappointing but we were applauded off the pitch by the Palace supporters which says everything about our performance,\u201d said Jolley. \u201cIt was a mammoth task with 10 men and we almost got there. The players delivered a performance that Grimsby can be proud of.\u201d This was the first time these sides had met in the FA Cup since Grimsby beat a non-league Palace team 1-0 in 1908 and the presence of almost 6,000 visiting supporters who had made the trip from Lincolnshire certainly gave the tie extra spice. The home manager, Roy Hodgson,, who embraced warmly with his opposite number before kick-off, to his credit, kept his word by naming a strong side \u2013 albeit with nine changes from their win at Wolves on Wednesday \u2013 including Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha in attack. Grimsby, who came into the match having seen their four-match winning streak end at home against Mansfield on New Year\u2019s Day, were looking to reach the fourth round for the first time in 19 years but saw their chances seemingly evaporate inside the opening 100 seconds. Townsend was going nowhere when he received the ball just inside the opposition\u2019s half but an over-exuberant lunge by Fox caught the forward on the shin. At first the referee, Martin Atkinson, allowed play to continue before booking the transgressor when the ball went out of play. It was only then that he received the signal from the VAR and upgraded the punishment to a red card, with one Grimsby fan showing his frustration by throwing something on to the pitch as Fox departed. Suddenly the size of their task had increased exponentially. Yet despite Alexander S\u00f8rloth spurning two golden opportunities as Palace piled on the pressure, Grimsby somehow navigated their way to the half-hour mark and even had a sniff of goal when their top scorer, Wes Thomas, almost found a way through from Elliot Embleton\u2019s pass. They had McKeown to thank, after he reacted brilliantly to tip Martin Kelly\u2019s drive on to the post before Palace\u2019s left-back Pape Souar\u00e9 limped off following a heavy challenge. And, despite Palace mustering 14 shots in total, the visitors made it to the break unscathed, if not at full strength. The theme was no different in the second half as the hosts continued to press forward but their struggles highlighted the recurring issues for Hodgson\u2019s side in front of goal. After Kelly was once again denied by McKeown, and Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 hit the post with a header, the ineffective S\u00f8rloth was replaced by Connor Wickham, while Ayew, who scored his first goal for the club in the victory over Wolves, was introduced soon afterwards. Even then Grimsby could have snatched the win as they took advantage of Palace\u2019s lack of cutting edge to push forward in the last 10 minutes, although Wayne Hennessey was never really seriously tested on his return to the side. But then came the second sucker punch for Jolley and his brave team. \u201cIt was attritional,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cWe\u2019d had a few chances before we finally scored the goal but you have to give a lot of credit to Grimsby, having lost a player so early on.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
