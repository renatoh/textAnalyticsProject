The choices were made by Stig Abell, editor of the Times Literary Supplement, Syima Aslam, founder of the Bradford literature festival, authors Juno Dawson, Kit de Waal and Alexander McCall Smith and journalist Mariella Frostrup. The list is intended to mark the 300th anniversary of Daniel Defoe\u2019s Robinson Crusoe, widely seen as the progenitor of the English-language novel. The books chosen by the panel are those that have made a personal impact on them, and are divided into 10 categories. These include \u201clove, sex and romance\u201d, which features titles ranging from Jilly Cooper\u2019s Rivals to Judy Blume\u2019s Forever; \u201cidentity\u201d, which moves from Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved to Zadie Smith\u2019s White Teeth; and \u201cadventure\u201d, which includes Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials, Walter Scott\u2019s Ivanhoe and Raymond Chandler\u2019s The Big Sleep. \u201cSo many amazing novels are not on the list,\u201d said Dawson. \u201cAs this panel of judges, we\u2019re not qualified to say this is the definitive list, but we are qualified to say these are our favourites. We knew right from the beginning that the role of these lists, almost, is for people to disagree with them \u2026 and we could only pick 100 books.\u201d So while there\u2019s no Wuthering Heights, the Bront\u00eb sisters do feature on the list with Anne Bront\u00eb\u2019s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. And while Moby-Dick doesn\u2019t appear, Herman Melville does \u2013 with Bartleby, the Scrivener. \u201cI hope people look at the list and recognise how we have allowed the emotions behind a novel to factor into our choices, not how many copies it\u2019s sold, or if it\u2019s considered a work of great literature,\u201d said Dawson. \u201cA novel only really matters in its relation to its reader \u2026 I\u2019ll never forget reading [Pullman\u2019s] The Subtle Knife in the Pavilion Garden in Brighton. I was crying, and a woman came over and asked if I was alright \u2013 she\u2019d seen what I was reading and knew where I was up to.\u201d She added that she had pushed for more children\u2019s and young adult titles to be included on the list, \u201cbecause if it weren\u2019t for the books we loved as children, we wouldn\u2019t be readers as adults\u201d. So alongside Orlando, Middlemarch and Our Mutual Friend, the list also features The Witches, The Hunger Games, Noughts and Crosses and The Earthsea trilogy. BBC Arts director Jonty Claypole said the list took \u201cmonths of enthusiastic debate\u201d to put together. \u201cThere are neglected masterpieces, irresistible romps as well as much-loved classics. It is a more diverse list than any I have seen before, recognising the extent to which the English-language novel is an art form embraced way beyond British shores,\u201d he said. The unveiling of the list launches a year-long celebration of literature at the BBC, headed by the new BBC Two series Novels That Shaped Our World. Beginning on 9 November, the series will explore the novel from the perspective of women\u2019s voices, the empire and working-class experience. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2019. An earlier version incorrectly said that the list marked the \u201c200th anniversary\u201d of the publication of Robinson Crusoe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
