The answer, as any young child knows, is the Gruffalo, but not as you have ever seen him before. Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler, the creators of the beloved children\u2019s storybook monster, have reimagined some of their best-known characters in the light of the coronavirus crisis, creating a series of images showing how Zog, Stick Man and others are coping with social distancing, home schooling and isolation. The series of 12 images, published in full exclusively in Saturday\u2019s Guardian, include an updated version of Room on the Broom, one of their most popular books, in which the characters, rather than fighting for space on a broomstick, sit far apart. The dastardly Highway Rat, feared and loathed for stealing travellers\u2019 food in their 2011 story, has turned to taking toilet paper at swordpoint from supermarket shoppers. And in a moving image updating A Squash and a Squeeze, the first book that the pair created together in 1993, the little old lady can\u2019t take her animals into her house, but instead relies on them to buy her groceries while she self-isolates inside. In their almost two-decade partnership, during which they have created more than 20 books together, Donaldson and Scheffler have become some of the bestselling and most beloved authors in Britain, with a vast army of devoted young fans. It was Scheffler, who illustrates the words written by Donaldson, who had the idea to update the characters in the hope of using his characters\u2019 popularity for good, he told the Guardian. \u201cI am not a nurse, I am not a doctor, and the situation is awful. And I thought, what can I do? As an illustrator, this is what I can do.\u201d Donaldson enthusiastically agreed, updating a number of rhymes, and Scheffler set to work at speed last week. \u201cI just thought it would be a nice thing for children to see the characters who they know, relating to this situation that they don\u2019t understand. \u201cIt\u2019s a little \u2018hello\u2019 from Julia and me, [to say] that we are there, and there will be another book, and there will be better times.\u201d Scheffler is also currently working on a non-fiction book about coronavirus for slightly older children, while Donaldson has launched a weekly online broadcast on the websites of her publishers Macmillan and Scholastic to entertain and support fans during the crisis. \u201cTo everyone at home, we send our best wishes, and hope you keep well,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
