James, Bristol Between spud peelings, bread on the turn and last night\u2019s rice congealed into the shape of a brick, we bin \u00a320bn worth of food in the UK annually, according to Wrap, the waste-reduction body. We all need to make changes, James, and this starts with how you\u2019re shopping. Obvious, yes, but taking stock, working out how many mouths need feeding and, as the Guardian\u2019s Tom Hunt puts it, \u201creally eating for pleasure\u201d (by which he means valuing your food) will stand you in good stead. \u201cThe key is changing the way you buy,\u201d says Skye Gyngell, chef and founder of London\u2019s Spring, who runs a \u201cscratch menu\u201d using waste. She shops little and often, supported by a \u201creally strong pantry\u201d of pulses, olive oil, vinegars and mustards. \u201cI make a big soup or slow-cooked dish on Sunday that will see us through a couple of meals,\u201d she says, bolstering it with salad, cheese or good-quality bread picked up on her way home. Our Anna Jones agrees: \u201cDeciding what kind of cook you are is also useful. Some people need to meal plan, do a weekly shop and batch cook \u2013 which obviously depends on where you live geographically \u2013 but I want to cook something I\u2019m craving that night, so it suits me to shop in small increments, and I find I waste less this way, too.\u201d For veg not destined for the compost, Douglas McMaster, the chef behind zero-waste restaurant Silo, formerly of Brighton and now relocated to London\u2019s Hackney Wick, turns them into pickles, ferments and dark treacle syrup, and carrot tops into pesto: \u201cYou can also make an amazing salad with fried potato skins dressed with slow-cooked red onions and mustard, then tumbled through turnip, radish or even beetroot tops,\u201d he says. Complete consumption, AKA root-to-fruit eating, is all well and good, but we shouldn\u2019t forget the basics, Jones says: \u201cMilk, bread and bagged salad leaves are top culprits for food waste, so buy them in small enough quantities that you use them up and, if there are leftovers, you have a couple of recipes up your sleeve.\u201d Stale breadcrumbs are good for adding texture to mac and cheese, take on flavour well (for salads or a croustade), and can be used straight from the freezer. Jones uses salad leaves that have seen better days in soups, stews or pasta dishes; leftover nuts are added to her \u201clittle jar of random nuts\u201d for pesto, frangipane or toasting, chopping and tossing over soups. Essentially, be intuitive: \u201cTrust yourself,\u201d she says, \u201cif you haven\u2019t got self-raising flour, for example, don\u2019t go out and buy some, just use plain flour and baking powder.\u201d We don\u2019t often think of wasted fish, says Hunt, who encourages buying the whole animal: \u201cPeople can be squeamish when it comes to heads, but the cheeks are the best tasting, most succulent piece of meat on the fish.\u201d Chef Josh Niland champions fin-to-gill eating in The Whole Fish Cookbook: \u201cBuying and cooking only fish fillets is not only creatively limiting but also neglects the majority of the fish \u2013 a shame, both from an ethical and sustainable point of view.\u201d (A cod fillet, for example, makes up just half the fish\u2019s weight.) While puffed fish skin and eye chips might not be on the cards for my tea tonight, collars, heads and offal are worth a try. \u201cAttempting fish offal for the first time at home can feel intimidating,\u201d says Niland, who suggests starting with fish liver on toast, for which the best approach is to treat it as you would chicken liver: \u201cPink and warmed through with a tan crust on the outside.\u201d We all know we should be eating less but better-quality meat, and this goes hand-in-hand with zero-waste cooking. Hunt opts for cheaper cuts or parts of the animal that are often wasted (or fed to other animals), such as offal or chicken wings: \u201cSupport a good butcher by bringing value to the cuts of meat they otherwise might have to throw away due to lack of demand.\u201d Chickens are the obvious choice for buying whole, and Hunt picks up two carcasses every Saturday, pop Offal can be a harder sell, but Hunt thinks he can tempt you, James: \u201cI didn\u2019t like kidneys until I tried them devilled. Make sure you remove the core, then fry them quickly in some butter with cayenne pepper, Worcestershire sauce, redcurrant jelly and cream, and they\u2019re delicious.\u201d Just add a bit of parsley at the end to freshen things up. \u2022 Got a culinary dilemma?
