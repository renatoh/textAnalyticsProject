One fifth of those polled said they had been discouraged from taking GCSEs and 34% felt they did not get the help and support they needed from teachers and other staff. More than a third (38%) said they had been bullied because of their disabilities, with one in 20 saying their bullies had been teachers. However, the survey of disabled 16 to 24-year-olds, carried out as part of the DRC's educating for equality campaign, found that the most common feeling was that of being \"left out\". More than 40% reported feeling isolated at school. Half said they missed out on games or PE, and of these nearly 50% said the school could have made better adjustments to cater for their disabilities. Higher and further education fared slightly better in the poll, with 17% of disabled students in colleges and universities saying they felt discriminated against. However, slightly more than a quarter of the people surveyed did not go on to further or higher education. Of these, 30% said they would have liked to, but felt they had been prevented from doing so because of their disability or health problem. Nearly a quarter had been advised not to continue their education by their schools, and six out of 10 said they did not feel sufficient support would have been provided to enable them to complete a course. Neil Crowther, head of education policy at the DRC, which advises the government on policy, said discrimination was persisting. Despite changes in education to make it more inclusive for disabled people, the research showed the changes were not quick enough. Last September the Disability Discrimination Act was widened to specifically include the education sector. The act places responsibility on institutions to stop discrimination and to make \"reasonable adjustments\" to combat such problems, including changing policy and building structures to make the sector more friendly to disabled people. Mr Crowther said the further education sector was leading the way in these changes, but that universities and schools were \"a different kettle of fish\". \"In higher education it's difficult to get a national programme going for autonomous institutions. It's been difficult to reach out to schools, which are very concerned about the burdens of new education. We're hoping to get a bigger programme of staff development around these issues into schools,\" he said. He added that government initiatives such as school league tables worked against inclusive policies by forcing schools to focus more on average results than the individual's attainment. Staff training, he said, was the key to change and trainee teachers should be taught about disability in the classroom during their courses. Bert Massie, chairman of the DRC, said the research showed that there was \"still much to do\" to ensure equality of opportunity for young disabled people, who now have new rights to prevent discrimination in education. Panelists including the education minister Stephen Twigg will debate the research in London this evening. Education minister Catherine Ashton said: \"We are committed to creating an inclusive and high quality education system for all pupils. \"This report highlights the importance of our action. The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act introduced last year strengthened the right of children to a mainstream education and placed new duties on schools and LEAs not to discriminate against children with disabilities, to make reasonable adjustments to allow for their inclusion in schools and to plan to increase schools' accessibility.\" For more information, contact the DRC helpline on 0845 7622633, or email to enquiry@drc-gb.org."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
