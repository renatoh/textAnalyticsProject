More than 100 Republican and Democratic members of Congress signed a letter to the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, calling for a rethink of policy towards Cuba. \"For five decades, US policy has tried economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation to force changes in Cuba's government,\" the letter said. It added that the peaceful transition under way in Havana demonstrated that \"the policy has not worked\". It added: \"A complete review of US policy is clearly in order now.\" John Negroponte, the US deputy secretary of state, said there would be no early end to US economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation of Cuba despite Castro's exit. \"I can't imagine that happening any time soon,\" he said. Although Castro was a towering figure on America's list of enemies long after other icons of the cold war had passed on, there was a concerted effort from the administration today to diminish the importance of his retirement. The state department argued that the transfer of authority from Fidel to his brother, Ra\u00fal, suggests little likelihood of substantial political reform \u2014 and so no reason for a major shift in policy. The US law authorising the embargo on American firms doing business with Cuba specifically prohibits recognition of any government in Havana that includes Ra\u00fal Castro. George Bush, in Rwanda today during a tour of Africa, set the bar for US engagement even higher, calling for free elections in Cuba. \"What does this mean for the people in Cuba?\" he told reporters. \"I view this as a period of transition and it should be the beginning of the democratic transition in Cuba.\" Castro's resignation has revived hopes that Washington could at least recognise the beginnings of symbolic change in Cuba with Fidel Castro's departure from the scene \u2014 if not during the remaining months of Bush's presidency then by the time his successor arrives in the White House in January 2009. Jim McGovern, a Democratic member of Congress who was one of the organisers of the letter to Rice, said Castro's success in managing a peaceful transition \u2014 in the face of nearly 50 years of US opposition \u2014 should at least focus attention on the failure of Washington's hard line to influence events inside Cuba. \"Here is the deal: by any objective measure US policy towards Cuba over the last 50 years has been a failure. \"I am not going to hold my breath that this administration is going to do anything good or positive. But hopefully the next administration and the next Congress will get the backbone to begin to pare down this policy that is a relic of the cold war.\" Others said a gradual handover of power, under way since Castro fell ill in 2006, has produced signs of change, and hoped that Washington would encourage the developments. \"There are things that were set in motion some time ago and could get a new impetus now,\" said Lawrence Wilkerson, a chief of staff to former Bush secretary of state Colin Powell. However, any move towards engagement would run into opposition from the Cuban exile community Miami, which forms a powerful bloc in Congress. Today, Cuban-American leaders resisted any attempts to lift a travel ban or other restrictions. \"It matters nothing at all whether Fidel, Ra\u00fal or any other thug is named head of anything in Cuba,\" Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican member of Congress who was born in Havana, said. That strength of feeling weighed heavily on all presidential candidates, who offered muted reactions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
