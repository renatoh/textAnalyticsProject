Liverpool are back on the map, according to their manager. Virgil van Dijk was in fine form against Bayern. That\u2019s all from me. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye! Jurgen Klopp speaks! \u201cThe second half was very very mature. The first half we should have played more football. You can never rest. The only opportunity you have is to keep the ball. We didn\u2019t do it first half but second half we did it brilliantly. It is so difficult to play here at Bayern. It\u2019s a really big one. I\u2019m so proud of how the boys did it. Hendo early, he twisted his ankle, hopefully not too serious. After that it is just brilliant. The first goal, fantastic. I will have to watch it back 500 times. It is outstanding what he is doing there. It was really difficult for Bayern and we are in the quarter-finals, which is amazing. Virgil at set-pieces, the boy is a massive threat. The size we have, the power we have, we are a massive threat. The game didn\u2019t look like Bayern will outplay us. They struggled with confidence so we scored the other two. Andy Robertson\u2019s booking is not cool, but he is a young boy. I asked the ref after the game. He said it is reckless. It was the last minute...\u201d The only blow for Liverpool is the booking that means Andy Robertson will sit out the first leg of their quarter-final. I wonder if Jurgen Klopp will turn to James Milner instead of asking Alberto Moreno to do his thing at left-back. They could also do with Mo Salah returning to goalscoring form. Salah has gone six games without a goal. That said he did create Sadio Mane\u2019s second goal with a magnificent assist tonight. While it\u2019s the first time since 2009 there have been four English sides in the last eight, it\u2019s the first time since 2006 there haven\u2019t been any German sides in the quarters. That will hurt. This is an average Bayern Munich side, by their high standards, and there isn\u2019t much behind them in the Bundesliga sadly. Here\u2019s Daniel Taylor\u2019s match report from the Allianz Arena. It finished Barcelona 5-1 Lyon at the Nou Camp. Which means the sides in Friday\u2019s quarter-final draw are Ajax, Barcelona, Juventus, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Porto and Tottenham. Barca, Juve and City are the sides to beat, with Liverpool close behind. James Milner is asked about Jordan Henderson\u2019s early injury. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy losing your captain. We dealt with it and Fabinho came on and did very well.\u201d Virgil van Dijk is asked about his goal. \u201cIt feels amazing. Overall to go through is the most important thing. Virgil Van Dijk speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s a great evening. We knew it was going to be tough. They are a great team. We knew we would get chances to score. The equaliser was unlucky but we did the job. On to the last eight.\u201d That was very good from Liverpool. Admittedly this isn\u2019t one of the great Bayern Munich sides, but Liverpool still had to get the job done against a very experienced side. They barely gave Bayern any chances, kept their cool after Joel Matip\u2019s own-goal just before the interval and took their chances with aplomb. That\u2019s your lot. It was easy in the end for Liverpool, who are through to the quarter-finals after a resilient, clinical and professional performance. \u201cNo doubt Gary Neville will claim that Liverpool can\u2019t win the PL now,\u201d Mike MacKenzie says. 90 min+3: Wijnaldum whacks a shot over from 25 yards. Liverpool are almost there. 90 min+2: Andy Robertson\u2019s booked for a foul on Leon Goretzka, which means he\u2019ll miss the first leg of Liverpool\u2019s quarter-final. Activate Alberto Moreno! Robertson looks devastated. 90 min: This is the first time since the 2008-09 season both Bayern and Real Madrid have failed to make the last four. 87 min: Adam Lallana replaces James Milner. 85 min: \u201cMoney-throwing competition, says Klopp?\u201d Peter Oh parps. \u201cSadio is Man\u00e9 in the bank!!!\u201d This has been on the way for the last few minutes. Divock Origi finds Mo Salah on the right and the Egyptian uses the outside of his left foot to send a cracking cross towards the far post, where Mane heads his second of the night past Neuer. That should be that. Liverpool are joining the other three English sides in the quarter-finals. As for Bayern, their fans are heading for the exits. There\u2019s no stopping Sadio Mane at the moment! Or Liverpool, for that matter. They\u2019re heading into the last eight. 83 min: Divock Origi replaces Roberto Firmino. 82 min: Renato Sanches drifts one wide from 25 yards. 81 min: Bayern are heading out, Schalke were destroyed by Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund were well beaten by an injury-hit Tottenham side. Tottenham didn\u2019t even have Harry Kane or Dele Alli in the first leg and still won 3-0 at Wembley. What has happened to German football? 80 min: Firmino rams a shot straight at Neuer from 25 yards. A third Liverpool goal looks likelier than a Bayern second. 79 min: The disappointing James Rodriguez makes way for Swansea legend Renato Sanches. 75 min: Liverpool slice through Bayern again, a slick move sending Salah surging into the middle. The forward ignores Wijnaldum to his lef, dips inside and looks certain to score. Yet Rafinha manages to hold him up and that allows Sule to make a last-ditch challene, whipping the ball off Salah\u2019s feet just in the nick of time! 73 min: Fabinho makes an excellent challenge to deny Coman in the Liverpool area. The winger looked like he had the legs on Fabinho there. Liverpool deal with the resulting corner. They\u2019ve defended very well tonight. I can\u2019t remember Alisson making a save in the second half. 72 min: Bayern make their second change, Leon Goretzka on for Javi Martinez. 71 min: Liverpool have another corner, Fabinho\u2019s shot deflected over. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s deep delivery is headed back towards the left post. Mane tries to make something of it. He settles for another corner, which comes to nothing. Never underestimate this man\u2019s importance to Liverpool. Exemplary at the back, now he\u2019s made the difference in attack! The ball was swung in from the right by James Milner and there was the towering Virgil Van Dijk leaping highest in the Bayern area. He\u2019s too big and powerful for his markers in red and Neuer can\u2019t do anything about a thumping header into the bottom-right corner! Bayern need to score two more goals now. That could be all Liverpool need! 68 min: Milner wins a corner on the left. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s vicious delivery has to be clawed behind by Neuer at the far post, with Matip closing in. Another chance for Liverpool. 65 min: Thiago brings down Wijnaldum with a late slide tackle and earns a yellow card. 64 min: This is such a bitty game. You feel it might be a mistake that makes the difference. 63 min: Matip bumps into the back of Lewandowski on the left. The Liverpool centre-back picks up a cheap booking. The free-kick comes to nothing. 61 min: Bayern make their first change, Kingsley Coman on for Franck Ribery, who didn\u2019t do much. 60 min: Kingsley Coman will be on imminently. While he waits Bayern almost score. Gnabry escapes to the right and flashes a cross into the middle from the byline, but it evades both the sliding Lewandowski in the middle and James at the far post. Luckily for Liverpool the ball trickles to safety. 59 min: The camera picks out Joachim Low and Oliver Bierhoff in the stands. I wonder if they caught up with Mats Hummels, Jerome Boateng and Thomas Muller. 57 min: This is a dominant spell for Liverpool, which is sub-optimal for Bayern. The hosts need to work up a head of steam before it\u2019s too late. Perhaps Niko Kovac will look to get Kingsley Coman on soon. 55 min: Salah\u2019s flick almost runs to Robertson on the edge of the area, but he\u2019s blocked off by Rafinha. Liverpool have spent a few minutes inside Bayern\u2019s half, which will suit them nicely. 53 min: This remains quite a sloppy game. 50 min: Liverpool counter, Mane finding Salah before being chopped down on the halfway line. An advantage is played, allowing Salah to run at the backtracking Bayern defence. He reaches the edge of the area and lashes goalwards with his left foot, but Neuer beats the Egyptian\u2019s shot away. 49 min: Gnabry runs at Robertson and wins a corner. James Rodriguez takes it and Van Dijk heads away. 48 min: A low-key start to the half. Bayern\u2019s fans are making plenty of noise, though. Liverpool are going to have to show a lot of nerve here. 46 min: Bayern get the second half underway. An intriguing half draws to a close. Liverpool have the advantage thanks to some special work from Sadio Mane, but Bayern have hope thanks to Joel Matip\u2019s own-goal. This is tantalisingly poised. Liverpool are going through as it stands, but Bayern only need one goal. 45 min+1: There will be two added minutes. 45 min: Lewandowski charges through and lifts a shot wide. He was offside, though. 44 min: Alaba curls the free-kick straight at Alisson. 43 min: James charges through the middle after an error from Fabinho, who brings down the Colombian in his haste to make amends. Bayern have a free-kick 30 yards from goal. Fabinho has been booked, Just like that, Liverpool\u2019s momentum is wiped out. It all comes from a straightforward ball over the top from deep from the back. Robertson hasn\u2019t tracked Gnabry\u2019s run and that leaves him in trouble. Gnabry speeds into the area from the right and hammers a low cross-shot into the six-yard box. It bounces off Joel Matip\u2019s shins and into the net, leaving Alisson helpless. Liverpool still lead on away goals but they have to be careful now. Bayern are back in it! 37 min: With Van Dijk pulled out wide to confront Gnabry, Robertson does well to cut out the German\u2019s cross in the six-yard box. Lewandowski was lurking. Moments later James sends a useless cross out for a goal-kick. 35 min: One corner leads to another. These are nervy times for Bayern, who really can\u2019t afford to concede again before the break. 34 min: A sweeping Liverpool move begins with Salah and Mane combining beautifully near the halfway line. Bayern are opened up so easily from there. Mane speeds down the left and releases Robertson, who hammers a shot goalwards as he surges into the area. Neuer saves at his near post and concedes a corner. 33 min: There hasn\u2019t been much of a response from Bayern yet. They lack ideas. Lewandowski is very isolated. We\u2019ve barely seen anything from James Rodriguez. 30 min: Lewandowski\u2019s deflected shot goes straight at Alisson from the edge of the area. 28 min: This is the first time Liverpool have scored the opening goal in a European away game since the second leg of last season\u2019s semi-final defeat to Roma. Mane got that one as well. This is wonderful from Sadio Mane! Nothing seems to be on when Liverpool\u2019s in-form man tries to make something of a long ball forward from Van Dijk. But he manages to outmuscle Rafinha and lever himself into position on the left of the Bayern area. All of a sudden there\u2019s trouble for Bayern, who could have done without Neuer racing off his line. Mane controls brilliantly before spinning adroitly to open a yard of space. The question now is whether he can dig out a finish from an awkward angle - and he can, scooping a left-footed shot into the empty net to give Liverpool a precious advantage! That is a superb goal and it leaves Bayern needing to score twice! Liverpool have the away goal! 25 min: Remember, 0-0 is the only result that takes this into extra-time. At the moment it feels like both teams could play until tomorrow without scoring. Hang on a minute, though. Here\u2019s an opening for Firmino, space opening up for him on the edge of the area. He takes a shot early and lashes a fierce effort just wide of Neuer\u2019s left post. 23 min: Mane tries to slip a pass through to Salah. Nothing doing. 20 min: This is pretty stodgy from Liverpool, so much so I\u2019m wondering if Klopp is going to whip away a mask to reveal he\u2019s actually Gerard Houllier in disguise. Then again Bayern don\u2019t look any great shakes. Let\u2019s be generous and call this game tactically absorbing. 17 min: Oh no. 16 min: \u201cI never thought Henderson and Kenny Dalglish had much in common other than captaincy, but just as in 1981 Kenny Dalglish came off against Bayern after two minutes to be replaced by Howard Gayle,\u201d Ian Copestake says. \u201cOmen?\u201d 15 min: I\u2019m not sure if Salah has had a touch yet. 13 min: Fabinho replaces the injured Jordan Henderson, who accepts an arm round the shoulder from Jurgen Klopp. Then Henderson heads down the tunnel to receive more treatment. Play resumes. Before the change Klopp was getting very agitated with his team. He\u2019s right to be concerned by signs of sloppiness in their play. Bayern are edging this. 12 min: Henderson has gone down again. His evening\u2019s over. Fabinho will come on. 11 min: With Liverpool forced back, Bayern are able to set up camp in the away side\u2019s half. Martinez lofts a pass over the top of the Liverpool defence, where they\u2019ve fallen asleep, allowing Lewandowski to bundle through. Luckily for Liverpool, Van Dijk reacts in time and muscles Lewandowski off the ball. The Bayern striker falls and screams for a penalty. The roar from the crowd is deafening, but the Italian referee waves Bayern\u2019s appeals away. We don\u2019t even go to VAR. 10 min: Ribery powers into the Liverpool area from the left, but Henderson, who\u2019s returned to the fray, is there to sweep up. Bayern are pressing here. 9 min: Bayern threaten on the edge of the area, Lewandowski almost sending Gnabry through on goal. Robertson does well to mop up. He scrambles clear, but then Firmino puts his team-mates in trouble with a dreadful square ball which reaches Thiago. Firmino\u2019s relieved to see Thiago clip a rising drive over from 20 yards. 7 min: Liverpool are down to 10 men while Henderson receives treatment on the side of the pitch. It seems he should be able to continue. 6 min: It\u2019s been quite a scrappy start so far, neither side able to muster many passing sequences. The pace is frantic. It\u2019s not settled down yet, but here\u2019s a delay: Jordan Henderson is down with an ankle injury after a collision with renowned hatchet man James Rodriguez. 4 min: Robertson receives the ball in space on the left and tries to surge past Rafinha. Yet the veteran Bayern right-back shows he\u2019s no slouch and makes a fine challenge to stop the Liverpool attack. Who needs Joshua Kimmich? 2 min: Hummels hoofs a decent long ball over the top of the Liverpool defence. Gnabry\u2019s made a dart in from the right flank, but Alisson reads the danger and is quickly off his line to claim the ball. Peep! Liverpool get the ball rolling to loud whistles from the home fans, who are making a right old racket. The visitors are kicking from left to right in the first half. Bayern, all in red, are the last German side left in the competition. Liverpool want to become the fourth English side to reach the last eight. Make your own Brexit gags. The teams walk out at the Allianz Arena. Liverpool are in their grey away kit. I dislike it. The teams are in the tunnel. Jurgen Klopp slaps hands with a small boy, who looks like all his birthdays have arrived at once. Arjen Robben is standing nearby. Was that his son? Robben is wearing a big smile. Jurgen Klopp speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s clear that at Anfield they didn\u2019t think they have to score. Tonight we both have to score. That changes it a little bit. But it\u2019s like the second half of the game. Who wants it more? It\u2019s not about them opening up for us. For both teams it is a mix. We want to score tonight and defend well. But it can change in the game in the moment. We wanted to have as many fresh legs in midfield as we can get. The midfield have played often together and played well. They offer a mix of being solid and being athletes against. Let\u2019s do it now.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not too worried about a slightly stodgy midfield,\u201d Matthew Dony says. \u201cSolidity is more important than creativity, hopefully the front three can bring the fancy stuff to the party. And, if not, then bring on Shaqiri with a point to prove for the last 20. I\u2019m trying to be rational. I\u2019m not as nervous as I have been before some other big games. It should be a good game.\u201d \u201cThat was very polite, nay euphemistic, of you to say this midfield trio are deemed not to work well together in big games,\u201d Ian Copestake says. \u201cIt is Klopp\u2019s favourite threesome, like an unfunny Marx brothers, that he falls back on when ... well, no one knows why he does this. Hendo\u2019s presence actually seems to stop the other two from being the progressive players they can be when the H is not picked. But as long as the full-backs fly up the wing now and again!\u201d Pre-match reading Some of you have pointed out I missed Sadio Mane\u2019s name off Liverpool\u2019s team. They aren\u2019t playing with 10 men. Mane starts. That\u2019s amended. Bayern Munich are without Thomas Muller and Joshua Kimmich because of suspension and Arjen Robben and Corentin Tolisso because of injury, while Kingsley Coman is only fit enough for a spot on the bench. Rafinha starts at right-back, Niklas Sule is preferred to Jerome Boateng at centre-back and Frank Ribery gets the nod over Coman on the left of midfield. Meanwhile Manuel Neueur makes his 100th appearance in the Champions League. The good news for Jurgen Klopp is that Trent Alexander-Arnold is available to start at right-back. Naby Keita is out, however, and Liverpool\u2019s midfield is Jordan Henderson, James Milner and Georginio Wijnaldum, a trio who have come in for criticism this season. Many fans feel they don\u2019t work well together in big games, that they lack the creativity to unpick defences. Time to prove people wrong. Bayern Munich: Neuer; Rafinha, Sule, Hummels, Alaba; Martinez, Thiago; Gnabry, James, Ribery; Lewandowski. Subs: Ulreich, Boateng, Goretzka, Davies, Jeong, Coman, Sanches. Liverpool: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Matip, Robertson; Henderson, Milner, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Mignolet, Fabinho, Lallana, Lovren, Shaqiri, Sturridge, Origi. Referee: Daniele Orsato (Italy). Hello. Should Liverpool lose this game? It\u2019s an interesting thought, sort of, although be careful about putting it to Jurgen Klopp. \u201cI don\u2019t think any other coach has to answer this question,\u201d Klopp said yesterday. \u201cIt only happens if you\u2019re Liverpool manager and the pundits come from Manchester United.\u201d Oof! Someone please check on Gary Neville, the Manchester United pundit in question, as he\u2019s the one who initially floated the idea that Liverpool should blow the Champions League in order to focus on winning their first league title since 1990. Yes, you can see where the former United defender\u2019s coming from. It may well help Liverpool if Manchester City are the ones with the fixture pile-up, leaving Klopp\u2019s side to reserve all their energy on the Premier League. But let\u2019s be honest: Neville, top Red that he is, simply doesn\u2019t want Liverpool to win anything at all. What\u2019s next? Don\u2019t win the Premier League because no one retains the title any more? Don\u2019t listen to him, Jurgen! In any case how does it work? How can you expect Liverpool to travel to Bayern Munich for the second leg of a Champions League last-16 tie, with the tie delicately poised at 0-0 after the first leg, and not give their all in front of supporters who have given up so much time and money to travel to Germany? And why would you want to focus so much on one competition when history shows it actually is possible to win more than one trophy in a single season? Put it this way, how would Neville have reacted in 1999 if Peter Schmeichel had decided there was no point saving Dennis Bergkamp\u2019s penalty in the last minute of the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal at Villa Park? United were down to 10 men for crying out loud! Keeping it out meant they had to go another 30 minutes in extra-time! A week before a European Cup semi-final against the mighty Juventus! Just let him score! No, it doesn\u2019t work that way, so we can probably expect Liverpool to be dialled in at the Allianz Arena this evening. Whether that\u2019s good enough to take them into the last eight remains to be seen, of course, but it surely won\u2019t be down to a lack of desire if they lose to a Bayern side who have regained some of their damaged aura in recent weeks. Bayern were solid at Anfield last month and, after a tricky start to the season, Niko Kovac\u2019s side have climbed above Borussia Dortmund at the top of the Bundesliga. They know what to do at the highest level in Europe, whereas Liverpool are still establishing themselves under Klopp, and have more than enough ways of scoring enough goals to reach another quarter-final - to put it into context, Bayern warmed up for this one with a thumping victories over Wolfsburg and Borussia Monchengladbach. Throw Liverpool\u2019s unconvincing away form into the mix and you\u2019ve got compelling reasons to back Bayern. Liverpool have lost their last five away games in Europe, a run that stretches back to their victory over City in last season\u2019s quarter-final, and haven\u2019t won away from home in the league since beating Brighton 1-0 on 12 January, since when they\u2019ve drawn 1-1 with West Ham and 0-0 with Everton and United. On the other hand they know a score draw here takes them through, just as it did when they faced Bayern in the semi-finals in 1981. They don\u2019t have to go goal crazy. They can rely on their stingy defence, which will be bolstered by Virgil van Dijk\u2019s return from suspension, and trust that they have enough pace in attack to worry Bayern on the break, all of which is a long way of saying that this could go either way. Your guess is as good as mine. It\u2019s too tight to call. All we really know is that it should be a fascinating occasion. Kick-off: 8pm GMT, 9pm in Munich."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
