Many believe it is the off-field partnership Clarke has forged with that man, Darren Lehmann, which has helped him to the verge of an achievement that would mean so much \u2013 becoming an Ashes-winning captain. \"I think he's one of the great beneficiaries of having Darren Lehmann around,\" said Adam Gilchrist, who was also in that team in Bangalore and dominated a sixth-wicket partnership of 167 with the 23-year-old debutant from western Sydney. \"I can't put words in his mouth but I would imagine if you ask him at the end he would speak along similar lines. He just de-stresses situations and players and leaders, so I think Pup has really relished working with him, and that's allowed a lot more of his inner personality to come out. \"He's a fighter,\" Gilchrist added of Clarke. \"He's not a guy that prances around and just has flashy cars or clothes. He likes flashy cars, he likes good clothes, but he's a fighter and he's got some real character in there. And I think not only his team-mates are feeling that now but also the Australian public, and there seems to be a trend change in acceptance of him. No one's ever questioned his batting ability, his runs speak for themselves, but I think they're enjoying seeing his character come through that everyone can engage with and relate to.\" Clarke is mystified by that, but he is not complaining. It is less than three years since he was booed to the crease in Sydney, his home ground, when he led Australia for the first time in Test cricket as they slid to an innings defeat which completed England's 3-1 triumph. Alastair Cook scored 189 in that game, taking his series aggregate to 766 at an average of 127.66, while Clarke ended with a lean 193 at 21. Even earlier this year in England it was Clarke who was still suffering, first with the back condition which has troubled him since the age of 17 \u2013 making the 100th appearance an even more laudable achievement \u2013 and then with the pain of a 3-0 defeat. Now, thanks in whatever measure to that combination with Lehmann, he is Australia's darling. He is no keener on a big fuss to mark this century than Cook. But Cricket Australia was urging supporters to click the \"Congratulations Pup\" button on its Twitter feed on Wednesday. Clarke confirmed that he has read and heard the suggestions that it is only in this series that he has finally won round the Australian public whose unfavourable opinion of him seems to have been shaped largely by a relationship with the \"Where the bloody hell are ya?\" model Lara Bingle and an ill-advised underwear ad. The succession of huge scores he made in 2012, starting with a famous unbeaten 329 against India, helped; but it was warning Jimmy Anderson to \"get ready for a broken fuckin' arm\" in Brisbane that sealed the deal. \"I've heard throughout this series people say that,\" he pointed out in the shade of the Lillee-Marsh stand at a roasting Waca on Wednesday lunchtime. \"I can't really answer it because I don't feel any different. I remember a few years ago walking out to a Test match in Brisbane and being booed by my own crowd. Then I go and make runs against India or South Africa or whoever it is and people seem to like me more. That doesn't mean I have changed as a person, it probably means I have scored a few more runs. \"I am not doing anything different at all, I am trying to be the best player I can be, I'm trying to help this team be as successful as it can be. My value of playing cricket for Australia has not changed one bit, my love of the game of cricket has not changed one bit.\" But he did confirm that he is taking extra satisfaction from this success as a result of the pain and occasional mockery he and his team had to endure in England. \"Why it feels so special is I certainly couldn't fault the work ethic of the players in England. Guys were working so hard but we just couldn't get a result so that was devastating for me as captain. You always want to perform individually but the team winning \u2013 it's really hard to describe that feeling, it's as special as I've ever felt in my career whether I've scored a hundred, a double hundred. Winning the first two Test matches has been more special than my own personal glory, that's for sure.\" Having swapped his helmet for a baggy green that day in Bangalore before completing a debut century to fulfil a promise he had made to his father, Les, when sitting in the back of a car as a boy, Clarke will be moved by the presence of his parents \u2013 Les, a cricket coach, having had two cancer scares in the last few years \u2013 at the Waca this week. \"It's special to have played 99 Tests, especially with the generation I've had [to compete with], and I've got my family coming over which is obviously very special too,\" he added. \"But right now I'm pretty focused on winning this third Test.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
