And bodies have also been piling up at the books festival. First Ian Rankin arrived in murderous mood to reveal that Inspector Rebus was soon for the slab. \"Usually he's in peril in the final 20 pages,\" Rankin said, \"and maybe next time he won't make it. I might bump him off - it depends how I'm feeling the day I write the final pages.\" If that were not menacing enough, P D James slaughtered her own creation, the abstemious Cordelia Gray, right in front of her fans. By turning her into a single mum, those nasty TV people \"destroyed my character\", complained James, a clear believer in fates worse than death. \u0095 One worries what terrible end might await Louis de Berni\u00e8res if he ever turned up in a P D James novel. Having fallen down the stairs of his hotel on the way to his reading, de Berni\u00e8res told the Loafer: \"My hand is buggered too and I can't really write with it. I had an operation to improve my guitar-playing and it went slightly awry.\" This could be a stroke of luck, as it took a badly broken leg to make him write Captain Corelli's Mandolin. \"I had a very early menopause at 35, brought on by my agent telling me I was not very good at character. So I went out and bought a big Russian motorbike. Then one day I hit a pothole that Merton council had carefully placed in my path, and smashed my leg up. My landlady was having a personal crisis and my girlfriend left me because she didn't want to look after me either, so I was stuck. If I was fit and healthy I wouldn't have written Corelli.\" To think the world came that close to being denied a cinematic masterpiece. \"The first person who asks about the film will get a smack in the mouth,\" said de Berni\u00e8res. Two thumbs up then, I take it. \u0095 Doris Lessing may have angered those members of the sisterhood who slave 'neath airbrushed picture bylines for sympathising with downtrodden males, but she still dreams of enslaving men. Bemoaning the inequity of how SF writer and fellow octogenarian Brian Aldiss is free to work when he pleases because his every whim is attended to by a bevy of young, beautiful women, she pondered: \"Why doesn't this ever seem to happen to women writers?\" \u0095 Meanwhile, Aldiss was chattering about how life has got more demanding since Steven Spielberg based his forthcoming film, AI, on one of his short stories. Whether Spielberg would approve of the little drama Aldiss cooked up with comedienne Helen Lederer to kick off the festival is another thing. His entrance, dressed as Hitler, flanked by several strapping stormtroopers, was greeted with a long pause, broken only by the gagging sound of someone swallowing their false teeth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
