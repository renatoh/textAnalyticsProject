The case of Derek Saville's disappearance has been reopened as a murder investigation after a man living in Australia came forward to say he believed he saw his now deceased father and a number of unknown men preparing a makeshift grave at the time the 25-year-old went missing in 1954. Mr Saville left his girlfriend's house to walk home in the village of Canon Pyon, near Hereford, and despite extensive searches was never heard from again. Rachel Williams Bicycle thefts rise to one every five minutes A bicycle is reported stolen every five minutes in England and Wales, according to figures released today by the Liberal Democrats. Before the arrival of the Tour de France in London next week, the statistics show there has been a 10% increase in thefts since 2001. The party's transport spokesman, Alistair Carmichael, who obtained the figures in a written parliamentary answer, called on the government to do more to tackle the crime. He said more money should be spent on extra police officers rather than \"expensive and ineffective\" ID cards. Press Association Stately home's \u00a3500,000 Chippendale table stolen An inlaid Chippendale table valued at up to \u00a3500,000 has been stolen from Newby Hall, the stately home near Ripon, North Yorkshire, for which it was made in 1775. The owner, Richard Compton, believes it was stolen to order, as the thieves smashed through the locked and shuttered window of the room in which it was displayed in the early hours and ignored all other contents. They triggered the house alarm, but had already made off with the table by the time staff arrived on the scene. It is one of a string of thefts of high-value antiques from wealthy homes in the area in the last six months. Maev Kennedy Supermarket launches lower alcohol wines A supermarket is launching a range of lower alcohol wines. Sainsbury's is branding four wines \"Ten%\", saying that standard wines have crept up to between 12% and 14.5% in strength.

With new winemaking techniques, we are now able to produce fantastic wines from several countries with a lower alcohol level.\" The Ten% range includes Australian chardonnay and Sangiovese shiraz ros\u00e9, Italian pinot grigio, and South African chenin blanc. Press Association Cameron gets backing from senior Tories Senior Tories yesterday defended David Cameron's strategy, insisting the party would keep to the centre and playing down Labour's boost from Gordon Brown's arrival at No 10. Two polls have put Labour ahead. Rightwing backbencher Edward Leigh called at the weekend for a focus on \"low taxation ... strong immigration controls, strong defence\". But George Osborne, shadow chancellor, told the BBC's Sunday AM: \"We are not changing our strategy.\" Shadow education secretary, David Willetts, and William Hague, shadow foreign secretary, also used TV appearances to back Mr Cameron.
