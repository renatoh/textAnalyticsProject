No wonder he clasped hands to head in wide-eyed exuberance. But the understated reaction of the winner, Kemar Bailey-Cole, was just as telling. He had expected to win, and win he did. Despite the absence of Usain Bolt and his long-time frenemy Yohan Blake from the Commonwealth Games\u2019 blue riband event, one thing holds true: the production line of Jamaican sprinters keeps rolling. Bailey-Cole had a stumbling start and was a metre or so behind Gemili early on. But he picked up to cruise home in a season\u2019s best 10.00sec, with Gemili second in 10.10 and another Jamaican, Nickel Ashmeade, third in 10.12. \u201cI\u2019m speechless,\u201d admitted Gemili. \u201cThe reception I received was amazing. It gave me goosebumps and the extra energy to hold on despite tired legs.\u201d The 20-year-old\u2019s medal was a minor surprise, given his personal best is 10.04 and there were several men in the competition who had gone under 10 seconds. But it was only a matter of time for the good vibrations, which have been growing ever since Gemili decided to switch from semi-professional football with Dagenham &amp; Redbridge to athletics in 2011, to be realised. Two years ago, as a callow 18-year-old, he just missed out on the 100m final at the London Olympics after running 10.06sec. Last year he became only the second British athlete \u2013 after John Regis \u2013 to crash through the 20-second barrier for 200m, before finishing fifth in the world championship final in Moscow. Now at last he has a medal. And he intends to build quickly on his achievements. \u201cThe times will come,\u201d said Gemili. \u201cBut medals are what counts and this is just a stepping stone for the European Championships in a couple of weeks\u2019 time and then the world championships next year and Rio in 2016.\u201d As Gemili wallowed in his personal triumph, Bailey-Cole was more laconic. \u201cThe start, it wasn\u2019t good,\u201d he sighed. \u201cThe rest was OK.\u201d Bailey-Cole is coached by Glenn Mills, who also trains Bolt at Kingston\u2019s famous Racers Track Club, and the parallels between the two sprinters are obvious. Both are tall \u2013 Bailey Cole is 1.93m, Bolt two centimetres bigger \u2013 and both combine a loping stride that allows them to eat up the track, with a zen-like relaxation which means they do not tighten up while others\u2019 legs go wobbly. Last year Bolt talked up the chances of Bailey-Cole one day eclipsing his feats, and this was a not insignificant marker. But he lacks Bolt\u2019s showmanship and, interestingly, Bailey-Cole admits the pair are not best buddies. \u201cI train with Usain but the friendship is not that close,\u201dhe said. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear from him beforehand.\u201d He was also less than complimentary when asked to compare his Glasgow experience with that of London 2012. \u201cI can\u2019t compare them,\u201d he said. \u201cLondon was really different food. It was way better than this. Scottish food could do with some more seasoning.\u201d Earlier, as the sun set on Glasgow, Blessing Okagbare, the Nigerian who dyed her hair gold for these Commonwealth Games, proved her confidence was not misplaced when she won her first major championship title in the women\u2019s 100m in a Commonwealth Games record. The 25-year-old ran 10.85sec \u2013 the second fastest time in the world this year \u2013 to beat the Jamaicans Veronica Campbell-Brown and Kerron Stewart, who ran 11.03 and 11.07 respectively. Britain\u2019s Asha Philip ran a personal best but agonisingly finished fourth in 11.18, while Bianca Williams was sixth in 11.31. Okagbare began to long jump aged 15 but switched to sprinting at 21 after her coached persuaded her to give it a go when she ran her first 100m in 11.21sec. \u201cI wanted to put on a show,\u201d said Okagbare. \u201cIt was about execution and staying patient \u2013 after 70m it just felt easy.\u201d In the women\u2019s hammer, England\u2019s Sophie Hitchon was only moderately happy to claim bronze with a throw of 68.72m, a distance over four metres below her personal best. Hitchon, a former ballet dancer who has two pet rats named Sid and Roddy, came into the Games believing she was in the form to challenge for gold. But the 23-year-old had to settle for third behind the Canadian Sultana Frizell, who retained her title from Delhi with a Games record throw of 71.97, while New Zealand\u2019s Julia Ratcliffe claimed silver. Hitchon said: \u201cThe first few rounds were a little jerky and I only got it together later on. That is what happens sometimes. I am amazingly pleased with a medal but I just always want the very best as an athlete.\u201d On Tuesday morning the action continues with the Olympic 800m champion and world-record holder, David Rudisha, starting his campaign, while the London 2012 long jump champion, Greg Rutherford, resumes his often testy rivalry with Chris Tomlinson as the pair attempt to qualify for Wednesday\u2019s final. The evening\u2019s action centres on Scotland\u2019s fast-improving Laura Muir taking on England\u2019s Laura Weightman and the Kenyan favourite, Hellen Obiri, in the women\u2019s 1500m. It should be some race. But unless Muir can conjure up a moment of high delirium in front of her home crowd, the atmosphere will struggle to match the sonic boom and fulsome exultations for Gemili on a night when he gave yet another shining display of his potential."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
