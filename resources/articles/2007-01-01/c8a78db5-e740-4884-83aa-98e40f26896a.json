First, animal welfare is an issue that transcends traditional US party lines. Republicans, even those who voted for Mr Bush, have been known to have joined with Democrats to support implementation of animal welfare requirements in agribusiness and animal research. Second, Professor's Singer's assertion that there is no federal legislation on the welfare of farm animals is not true. The 1966 Animal Welfare Act, and its subsequent amendments, provides protection to US livestock. Finally, the majority of money spent to pass the Arizona and Florida initiatives came from the Humane Society of the United States, a powerful animal rights organisation. According to the Wall Street Journal, HSUS spent $3.4m on the 2006 congressional elections and ballot initiatives, more than Exxon. They have contributed $150,000 to candidates for Congress, which is more than Halliburton.
