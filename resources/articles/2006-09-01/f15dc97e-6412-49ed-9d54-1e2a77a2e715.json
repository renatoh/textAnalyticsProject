Pompey's manager Harry Redknapp issued a libel claim against the BBC in the build-up to last Tuesday night's broadcast and his Bolton counterpart, Sam Allardyce, has been deep in dialogue with his lawyers after agents claimed in secret filming that he had received kickbacks to facilitate transfers. Redknapp believes \"there is not a single thing on there [the broadcast]\" to incriminate him. Allardyce has threatened legal action and insisted he has \"done nothing wrong\" but he has clearly been troubled by the agents' claims. \"Only I know what damage it does to me,\" said Allardyce. \"People might see me as a big bloke who can look after himself but everybody needs support at difficult times and none more so than Premiership managers. Everybody thinks we've got skin like rhinos but we're only human beings. It's hurt me, yes. But I've not been tempted to walk away.\" Scrutiny will turn tonight on how deeply the distraction has affected team affairs. Allardyce, who six months ago was on the Football Association's shortlist to become the England manager, is heartened by the support he has received from his club. \"Everyone, including all the players and staff, have been 100% behind me, which is very encouraging,\" he said. The midfielders Gary Speed and Kevin Nolan talked of being \"fully committed\" and of \"pulling together\" and echoed Allardyce's words by saying they were \"behind the manager\". However, the distractions surrounding the 51-year-old are set to persist. BBC executives pledged last week to forward tapes and background material to the FA's compliance unit, but no handover has yet taken place. FA officials will meet the producers of the programme today to ascertain exactly what they will receive. Redknapp, though, is more concerned about the threat posed by complacency. Portsmouth have dropped only two points from 15, inspiring a belief among the players that they can compete for a European position - something the manager tried to play down. \"It has been a surprise that we're doing so well,\" he said. \"I'd be a liar if I said I expected us to be up there at this stage of the season. I don't think anyone expected us to be. But it's too early to talk about Europe. \"It can turn so quickly. One minute you're up in this game and the next it can turn and knock you back down.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
