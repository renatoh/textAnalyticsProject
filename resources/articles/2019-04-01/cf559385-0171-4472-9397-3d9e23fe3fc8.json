Netherlands defender Van Dijk saw off stiff competition from Manchester City\u2019s Sterling to take the award after a brilliant season that has seen J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side concede just 20 goals from their 36 matches so far. Van Dijk, who moved to Anfield in January 2018 from Southampton for \u00a375m, has helped Liverpool record 17 clean sheets this season and becomes only the fifth defender to receive the award after Norman Hunter, Colin Todd, Gary Pallister, Paul McGrath and John Terry. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty difficult to put into words,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the highest honour you can get as a player to get voted player of the year by the players you play against every week. It\u2019s special. I\u2019m very proud and honoured to receive it.\u201d He was presented with the award at the Grosvenor Hotel in London on Sunday evening, with fellow Netherlands international Miedema also honoured for her performances this season that saw Arsenal win the WSL title on Sunday. \u201cI think we\u2019ve had an amazing season as a team and obviously with Joe Montemurro coming in last year, we\u2019ve changed the way we used to play a lot and that has benefited me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve stayed fit this year and I created a lot of chances but got a lot of chances as well. I am a number nine so I do need to score the goals.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
