PLEASE MAKE THIS STORY END! At yesterday's Euro 2004 draw, Sven-Goran Eriksson was once again asked if he's going to do o... sorry, force of habit... asked if he's going to quit his England job in the summer and take over at Chelsea. Wearing his trademark rictus, Sven calmly pointed to the other side of the room. When we turned back, the chair he had been sitting in was spinning round, papers on a nearby desk were wafting in the air, and a pair of doors were flapping back and forth. \"He's given us the bodyswerve again!!!\" grumbled the Fiver, as we peered through the double doors to witness a rope ladder dangling from an open window and a car wheelspinning off. But while Sven has got question avoidance down to an art form, Paul Smith, a Chelsea suit being operated by strings and pulleys from a garden in Cheshire, is more forthcoming. \"There's no interest in Eriksson and we've not even had one conversation about him,\" Smith told an 'ack from Ver Lahndan Eevnin Stanah. \"There's no substance to this story,\" he went on, thereby ensuring its place at the top of today's Fiver. \"How can you criticise Claudio?\" asked Smith, going on to talk about league positions before anyone could say anything about not starting with Damien Duff, buying Juan Sebastian Veron, or talking in a ridiculous oscillating pitch that sounds like someone trying to tune into the World Service on a set of cat's whiskers in a gale. \"Everyone at the club is very happy with the work he's been doing and we want him in charge at the start of next season.\" So that's that, then. We'll hear nothing more about Sven pitching up at Chelsea ever aga... actually, that's probably the least convincing sentence we've ever written, and God knows there's some competition. QUOTE OF THE DAY (now sponsored by Ged Houllier and liverpoolfc.tv) \"What's being said about Florent is very unjustified. I'm absolutely infuriated by the lack of grace. I like Steve Bruce, but on this occasion he should have avoided comment. It was a penalty. The boy is so quick the defenders can't catch him\" - Ged goes off on one yet again, this time defending the penalty-box antics of sprinting legend Flo-Po. CAN YOU STILL BE SHORT-CHANGED IF IT'S FREE? Despite the fact that some readers spend their afternoons surfing for grumble, guessing the identity of fuzzy stick characters, and generally avoiding the work they are paid well to perform, we at Fiver Towers know you - yes, you - are probably a busy person with a hectic life. And yet despite knowing this, and having more than a mild inkling that you only read this for the Rumour Mill and even that's not as good as it once was and maybe it'd be best for all concerned if I just took them up on that unsubscribe offer and signed up for Popbitch instead, we always make sure you have three long and particularly fatty paragraphs to pass over. But not today. Because today, also fully aware that our printer is low on toner, we've decided to cut to the chase by just shoe-horning three long and dull tales about Manchester United into one final paragraph at the end. If you are still reading, thanks, and trust us that it really is for the best. Rio Ferdinand drugs disciplinary hearing, December 18! Fergie \"not far away\" from signing new three-year deal! Yankee tycoon ups stake in club; take-over possibly imminent! Ordinarily, we'd add a few quotes, but (a) they're all so soporifically mundane, and (b) we're out of here before anyone notices. Sorry. THE RUMOUR MILL Apart from talk of Tugay going to Besiktas or Fenerbahce, and Louis Saha leaving Fulham for sunnier climes at Sampdoria, today's rumours are a bag of old chestnuts: Robbie Savage to Everton! Christian Vieri to leave Internazionale for Chelsea! Michael Owen in \u00a320m Barcelona switch sensation! Chelsea and Manchester United are also rubbing their sweaty palms together at the prospect of mopping up more Premiership talent, in the shape of Bolton's Jay-Jay Okocha! NEWS IN BRIEF A bad day for Jubilee Fireworks, who have been revealed as the firm responsible for the pre-match Molineux display against Newcastle in which a fan was hit in the face by a rocket. Not only have Wolves said they will never again hold a firework display before games, but the FA are to hold an inquiry as to the safety of such displays. Meanwhile, the fan, 38-year-old season-ticket holder Denise Butler, was due to be discharged from Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital today after treatment for severe facial lacerations. A good day for Neil Warnock, who celebrated his 55th birthday with champagne courtesy of Nationwide, who handed him the First Division manager of the month for November. He also signed a new contract at Bramall Lane, ensuring he will be the best manager in Sheffield for another two years. A neither-here-nor-there day for Leeds United, who have dismissed talk of a \u00a310m takeover bid from a consortium led by Sheikh Abdul bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa as \"pure speculation\". And Rivaldo has finally parted company with AC Milan after the pair came to a \"mutual agreement\" to officially cancel his leasehold of the San Siro dugout.
