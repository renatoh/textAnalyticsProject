I was really into The Secret History Of Our Streets on BBC2. I'm a real history geek, and finding out the history of London's streets, the characters, the stories, the way that the city existed before we were there, is just amazing. Box set? I'm watching the Danish version of The Killing. It's very underplayed and dark, and I'm enjoying how contained all the fraught emotion is. It's not all out there. It's not bombastic, it's on the downlow. I'm also rewatching Charlie Brooker's Dead Set. It's so horrible, but his misanthropy makes me so happy! I think he's a genius. It's one of my greatest ambitions, to be in a zombie film. I'm enjoying the tension and the horror of the house members getting eaten one by one. TV turn-off? I think a little less reality television, and a little more in the way of drama and stories, would make me happy. Probably any actor that you speak to would tell you that reality TV is the bane of their lives. Bring back? Can I be really geeky and say The X Files? That was my first TV love as a teenager. Oh, and can we have The Twilight Zone back? Come Dine With Me lineup? Wow, that's putting me on the spot! I'd like to meet the late Nora Ephron, who wrote When Harry Met Sally. She was so waspish and warm. A brilliant wit. Emma Thompson \u2013 anything that she brought to the table I'd be delighted with. David Starkey \u2013 I'd be very interested to see how he handles the Come Dine With Me situation. Oh, and someone young and warm and winsome. Let's throw Ben Fogle in the mix. Mastermind subject? Charles Dickens. I'm an enormous fan, and I probably reread him far more often than I should. I'd be massively concerned that they would find me out, but I'm always keen on a challenge. I'd be delighted to pit my tiny brain against such an enormous minefield of a topic. Jeany Spark appears in Wallander, Sunday, 9pm, BBC1"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
