The company has seen average daily share trades fall to 5,000 from 8,000-10,000 a year ago. It has been hit particularly hard by the slump in hi-tech stocks which has scared off many dot.com investors. The announcement yesterday came two weeks after the company's main US operation announced 3,400 job cuts, 11-13% of its staff. Russ Shaw, senior vice-president of Charles Schwab Europe, said it had to respond to market conditions and \"fundamental changes in the trading behaviour of British private investors\". With more than 30 brokers now offering online share dealing in Britain, he anticipated a shake-out in the sector. \"I don't think there is going to be room for everybody, especially during this down period.\" Between 160 and 180 jobs will be lost, spread across the company's headquarters in Birmingham and offices in London and Milton Keynes. It hoped to achieve the reductions through voluntary redundancies. The company said share trades were down 30% on what it hoped they would be. Just over a year ago Charles Schwab expanded rapidly to cope with a surge in share dealing, which at its height saw the number of trades hit 14,000 a day as small investors flocked to buy and sell hi-tech stocks. After criticism that it was struggling to meet demand, it opened the customer service centre in Milton Keynes.
