His girlfriend Maxine Carr, the 25-year-old teaching assistant detained along with Mr Huntley on Saturday, has been charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Mr Huntley, 28, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983 and was taken by police to a secure unit in the early hours of this morning. Rampton high security hospital, in Nottinghamshire, tonight confirmed that a 28-year-old man had been admitted for assessment today regarding concerns over his fitness to be interviewed by Cambridgeshire police. The case is scheduled to be heard tomorrow at Peterborough magistrates court, although police said they did not know if Mr Huntley would be appearing at court. Det Ch Insp Hebb announced today that Mr Huntley had undergone \"a series of medical exams\" since his arrest and that he had been sectioned on the recommendation of a psychiatrist. He added: \"Following lengthy discussions with the crown prosecution service in Cambridgeshire, I can tell you that in the last hour, detectives from the force have driven to the secure unit and have charged Ian Huntley with two counts of murder.\" Police were last night given an extension by magistrates to continue questioning both suspects. A decision on Ms Carr must be taken by around 6am tomorrow. Police have continued to search the woods at Lakenheath - about eight miles from the girls' hometown of Soham in Cambridgeshire - where their bodies were discovered on Sunday by passersby. Police say that due to the condition of the bodies, a postmortem examination could take several weeks. Police have also continued to search the cottage where Mr Huntley and Ms Carr lived, next to Soham Village College. Holly and Jessica's school, St Andrews primary, where Ms Carr was employed as a teaching assistant, has been the subject of a search, as has the home of Mr Huntley's parents, Kevin and Lynda Huntley, in nearby Littleport. The two 10-year-old friends went missing on the evening of Sunday August 4."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
