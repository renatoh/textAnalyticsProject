The Ramblers' Association estimates that on any given winter weekend, more than 400 of its groups strike out on organised walks. 'Walking is particularly popular in winter,' says Nick Temple, editor of the Time Out Book of Country Walks. 'It's a time of year when metropolitan living can feel most oppressive and city dwellers just want to get out of town and breathe fresh air into their lungs.' Whether you are looking to shed Christmas excess by striking out across the fields close to home, experience a winter wonderland in the mountains without having to don a pair of skis, or escape the winter altogether for some sunshine trekking, our guide to winter walking will show you how. How to burn off the Christmas pudding: Guided walks in the UK These sceptred isles are a walker's delight year-round but in the winter months the footpaths become less congested. And in the season of TV specials and Terry's Chocolate Oranges, a bracing walk can stop you feeling, and looking, like a Christmas pudding. Setting off into the wilds is even easier now that implementation of the Countryside &amp; Rights of Way Act 2000 has started opening up previously off-limits parts of England and Wales. Guided walks can bring a whole new dimension to your yomp. Going with an experienced leader removes the 'hit and miss' potential, and often they will share their knowledge of the nature or history of the area. Many walks are free, but those that aren't are often charity-led so you're doing good for something besides your waistline. The Ramblers' Association (020 7339 8500; ramblers.org.uk) Organises lots of group walks around the country ranging from short strolls to hillside treks, with some aimed at twenty and thirtysomethings or families with children. Walks are mostly for members, but some are open to the public, and non-members can join as guests on two or three walks (annual membership is \u00a324). Most walks can be joined without pre-booking but it's a good idea to contact the association in advance to find out any special information (such as whether it is necessary to bring a picnic). The National Trust (0870 458 4000; www.nationaltrust.org.uk) Holds a range of winter walks around the country throughout December and January - try the 10-mile Christmas Pudding Burner over Yorkshire moorland at Marsden on 26 December, or an afternoon walk in the Dedham Vale, Suffolk on 11 December, visiting some of the locations in Constable's paintings. Some walks are free, some make small charges; all need to be booked in advance. The Time Out Saturday Walkers Club (020 7359 8391; walkingclub.org.uk) Organises walks from the Time Out Books of Country Walks around London and the southeast throughout the year. Approximately five groups set out every Saturday. There's no need to book ahead and the walks are free, though participants are expected to have a copy of the relevant book (\u00a310.99; royalties and profits go to the Nicholas Albery Foundation). This is a very informal set-up. Emails are sent out during the week and members aim to set out together. The Cotswold Outdoor Festival of Winter Walks (020 7339 8500; ramblers.org.uk/winterwalks) The Ramblers' annual festival of walks, open to all, runs between 26 December and 3 January. Hundreds of free walks in England, Scotland and Wales are led by experienced leaders. Most are between four and seven miles long; some are for families, some allow dogs. The Herefordshire Winter Walking Festival (01568 797842; www.walkingfestival.com) Takes place between 27 and 31 December. Eleven circular walks of three to six miles show off the county's fine scenery and, in some cases, its local produce. Places must be booked in advance and tickets cost \u00a32-15 for adults; those at the higher end include a hearty farmhouse lunch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
