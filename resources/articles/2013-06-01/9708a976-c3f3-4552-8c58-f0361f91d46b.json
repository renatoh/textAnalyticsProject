The Labour leader will admit the public's faith in the welfare system has been shaken \u2013 and promise to ease the burden on the taxpayer by driving down rents, cracking down on low pay and making people work for longer before getting the higher rate jobseeker's allowance. He will also say unemployed parents will have to do more to prepare for the world of work as soon as their children reach the age of three or four, so long as adequate child care is available. Labour sources confirmed that Miliband was not likely to reverse the abolition of child benefit for higher rate earners as a result of its broader decision to take the coalition government's current spending targets in 2015-16 as its starting point. But Miliband will not abandon the long- standing goal of abolishing child poverty by 2020, even though he will admit it is now more difficult and will require methods other than increasing child tax credits. The Miliband package in Thursday's speech in London is seen as critical to Labour being able to claw back its poll deficit on welfare and show its ability to take tough decisions. Labour will hope the electorate will focus on the party's decision to take a credible and specific stance on the deficit, after three years of low growth, rather than punish Labour for its apparent volte face by ending three years of criticism of welfare cuts. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Liam Byrne, said on Thursday that Labour's plan for a cap over three years on social security spending was a cap, and not simply a target. He said it would force the government to engage in long-term reforms necessary to bring the welfare bill down. But he did not spell out the benefits that would be subject to the cap and those that would be allowed to increase during an economic downturn. He said: \"If you have a cap you do not have latitude. You have to get a very quick handle. A cap is a cap and you set your social security budgets within that cap.\" He also acknowledged that Labour would not reinstate child benefit for higher rate taxpayers, saying: \"If we were in office today that is not a change we would have made, but we are being completely candid that the inheritance in 2015 would be completely bleak. The budget we inherit is our starting point and any changes we make to that budget have to be fully funded. This is a couple of billion quid. That is a large amount of money and there is a big queue of things that we want to get done,\" he said. Byrne said the housing benefit bill was the welfare benefit he was most keen to reduce: \"If councils had more power to regulate and control prices in the private rented sector then you [would be] creating some income [to put] into building more homes.\" He denied Labour would go far as reintroducing rent controls. He added: \"We need to put more of the something for something back into the social security system. A lot of people who have put a lot of money in have not got much back when they need it and that is especially true for working families.\" David Cameron on Wednesday accused Ed Miliband of \"complete weakness\" over welfare after Labour confirmed it would not make reversal of cuts to child benefit a priority. The prime minister said Miliband had condemned the child benefit plans \"in the strongest terms\" when they were first outlined in 2010. He accused Labour of taking \"policy altering substances\" and being gripped by utter confusion . Miliband's speech will promise to \"be laser focused on how we spend every single pound. Social security spending, vital as it is, cannot be exempt from that discipline\". He will say the three-year cap will separate the cyclical costs of social security, which rise with economic downturns, from the long-term drivers of extra spending ranging from higher rents to long-term worklessness. He will propose a switch in spending from subsidising rents mainly in the private sector to extra spending on building homes. He is expecting some of the biggest councils to club together to negotiate lower rents with private sector landlords through measures such as bulk purchasing. He will say: \"We cannot afford to pay billions on ever rising rents when we should be building homes to bring down the bill. Thirty years ago, for every \u00a3100 we spent on housing, \u00a380 was invested in bricks and mortar and \u00a320 was spent on housing benefit. Today, for every \u00a3100 we spend on housing, just \u00a35 is invested in bricks and mortar and \u00a395 goes on housing benefit.\" Miliband wants the contributory element in the welfare system to be strengthened by increasing the level of higher rate jobseeker's allowance for those with long work records. Some Labour MPs are deeply concerned at the apparent sharp shift away from universalism in Labour's announcements, including on child benefit and the winter fuel allowance. But former prime minister Gordon Brown already made this shift by introducing means-tested tax credits. Paul Kenny, the GMB general secretary, a potential critic in the union movement, welcomed the plans: \"Ed Miliband's commitment to tackle the affordable homes crisis will be welcomed and applauded as the first positive step in dealing with the housing benefit scandal. \"Also, his commitment to tackle low pay, so that taxpayers aren't left picking up a growing bill, such as companies paying the living wage, stopping abuse of zero hours contacts, preventing exploitation of temporary workers and outlawing recruitment only from abroad, are exactly the type of policies that will win working people back to Labour.\" Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, said: \"The two Eds only appear to be offering austerity-lite, parroting the Tories' divisive striver-versus-skivers rhetoric, but it is exactly these policies that are failing.\" Grant Shapps, the Tory party chairman, said: \"Ed Miliband's much-trailed welfare speech is completely empty. Labour have opposed every one of our measures to fix the welfare system and have now shown they have no credible alternative.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
