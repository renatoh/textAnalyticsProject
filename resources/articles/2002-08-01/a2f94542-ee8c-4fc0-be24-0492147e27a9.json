After weeks of on-off negotiations, Real finally snared the two-time World Player of the Year after a last-ditch bid was accepted by the Serie A giants. Ronaldo joined Inter five seasons ago from Barcelona for \u00a318million but in recent seasons his time at the San Siro has been plagued by injuries. Talks went on into the night as Real president Florentino Perez and his Inter counterpart Massimo Moratti looked to broker a deal to suit both parties. Ronaldo's stock has hardly been higher after he finished the World Cup as top goalscorer with eight as Brazil carried off the title. Inter are believed to have accepted a cash bid of \u00a322million, plus a player who they can choose when the transfer market opens in January. They will be allowed one of Flavio Conceicao, Pedro Munitis, Oscar Minambres and Raul Bravo. The Italians moved early in the day to sign Hernan Crespo from Lazio as a direct replacement for Ronaldo, acquiring the Argentinian from the cash-strapped Rome club. The deal had appeared to hinge of Real selling Fernando Morientes, but the Spanish international rejected a move to Tottenham Hotspur and then tonight turned down Barcelona after Real and their fierce rivals agreed a fee. Real were thought to need the \u00a315million-plus which that deal would have brought in to finance the Ronaldo deal. But now Real have Raul, Ronaldo and Fernando Morientes on board for their Primera Liga and European challenge. Ronaldo made it clear earlier this month that he was unhappy at Inter and demanded to be sold to Real. The European champions, who have stressed all summer long that they could not finance another world-record deal, baulked at Inter's initial demands for 100 million euros (\u00a363m)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
