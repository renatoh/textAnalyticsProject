When asked whether he knows which Celtic team will turn up for any given fixture, the manager offers an instant \"no\". Lennon adds: \"But that's been our problem. Not lack of commitment, a lack of consistency. And we have to find the nub of that, find the ingredient. I think the talent and ability is there but the consistency isn't.\" Celtic retain a capacity to perform to differing levels even within a single match. During a recent League Cup tie at Hibernian, Lennon's side were a goal behind and clearly toiling at half-time. A blistering second-half display saw them canter to a 4-1 win. On Thursday night, Celtic were outplayed for 20 minutes by Rennes. With an excellent recovery, again from a goal behind, Celtic won the Europa League tie 3-1. \"You can't wait 20 minutes for a game to get going, thinking you're going to find your rhythm, it doesn't happen that way,\" Lennon says. \"There are players on the opposition busting a gut to curtail you and make life difficult for you. You can't just think you've found the holy grail after beating Hibs 4-1. You have to go and do it again.\" Inexperience and a lengthy injury list are the mitigating factors that see Celtic standing third in the Scottish Premier League table. It must be remembered that Celtic pursued Sol Campbell, David James and Craig Bellamy in recent times as the manager looked to supplement his squad with seasoned campaigners. \"We have been looking but it's difficult to bring them in with the wages and demands,\" Lennon admits. Yet there is no batch of excuses to which Lennon is quick to point. That is to his credit, as is a continually relaxed demeanour despite the current, useful advantage Rangers have in the league. Other Celtic managers have failed to deal with pressure in Lennon's assured, calm style. \"It's frustrating that you go into games thinking: 'What am I going to get today?'\" Lennon says. \"You get that with younger players, and the squad is young, but they've had a year's experience where they've been to cup finals and lost the league by a point. So they know what's expected. I look at some of the players who did really well last year but they've been stop-start this year.\" Nobody sums up Celtic's erratic touch better than Georgios Samaras. The Greece international forward was outstanding against Rennes but earlier, poor form rendered him something of a whipping boy for the Celtic support. \"He has shown he can do it,\" explains Lennon. \"He's shown the all-round performance is there. You can't lose that \u2013 what you can do is switch it off. But he's shown to everyone that he can do it over 90 minutes and we have to tap into that. \"Sammy's that type where he's very laid-back, almost horizontal, it's in his nature. We had a chat with him on Wednesday night and said: 'You need to get your season up and going. We value you very highly but we've not seen enough so far.' We got the response we were looking for, though, so maybe he's just one of those players who needs a constant arm around him and encouragement.\" Lennon may need something similar if Celtic's title challenge stutters again at Motherwell. The Irishman was part of a Celtic team that famously missed out on the championship in the final minutes of the 2004-05 season in a game at Fir Park. \"It was the darkest day of my playing time here but bogey grounds are there to be broken,\" Lennon says. \"I want the players to go out positive and get on the front foot straight away. I'm hoping on Sunday it's the team who played so well second half against Hibs and who competed ferociously against Rennes in midweek. We had a great response from them on Thursday and I think there'll be a cracking atmosphere at Fir Park so I hope the players rise to that.\" The manager's vocabulary is smartly chosen. For now, hope is all Lennon has."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
