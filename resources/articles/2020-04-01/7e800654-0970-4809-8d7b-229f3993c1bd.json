The warning from the NSPCC comes after Europol, the law enforcement agency of the European Union, said it had seen \u201cincreased online activity by those seeking child abuse material\u201d. The charity said tech firms had had to scale back on the number of moderators tackling sexual abuse, giving offenders an \u201cunprecedented opportunity\u201d to target children who are spending more time online and are increasingly lonely or anxious because of the lockdown. Last month, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said third-party US content moderators would be working from home and the company would increase its use of artificial intelligence to moderate content during the coronavirus crisis. The NSPCC said it was concerned that such workers would not be able to moderate the most harmful content from home because of data protection, and that there were concerns around the impact on their mental health of working from home. AI is normally used to identify and triage harmful content, grooming and abuse, but there may be fewer human moderators available to ensure swift action is taken when content is identified, the charity said. Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, said: \u201cThe impact of the coronavirus lockdown has increased online risks and brewed a perfect storm for offenders to abuse children. \u201cThe public health emergency is creating major challenges across society, and like all of us, tech firms must adapt. It\u2019s vital they set out how they are prioritising protecting children by identifying and disrupting offenders with fewer moderation resources available. \u201cSocial media and gaming sites are proving to be a lifeline for parents and their children as they adapt to being at home, but we must also recognise there are heightened risks. \u201cIt is more important than ever for parents to have regular conversations with their children about what they\u2019re doing online and to reassure them they can come to you with any worries.\u201d The closure of schools and nurseries has led to children spending much of their day online, including time spent on educational activity, contact with friends and entertainment, but the NSPCC warned that it could increase the risk of sexual abuse. The NSPCC called on tech firms to share with governments the volumes of referrals they make during the crisis to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in order to track and identify child abuse risks. The charity also urged companies to share intelligence with one another about emerging and evolving risks. The Internet Watch Foundation, the UK charity responsible for finding and removing from the internet videos and images of children suffering sexual abuse, said it was braced for a rise in public reports of child sexual abuse on the internet during the pandemic. The IWF assesses footage and images reported to its hotline. The organisation said hotline staff would continue to go into the office and it was functioning as normal. Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of the IWF, said: \u201cMore people alone in their homes and more people spending longer online sadly means we are likely to see more people stumbling across criminal material involving child sexual abuse on the internet. We are also expecting criminals to be more active on the internet during the coming months.\u201d Last week, Europol\u2019s executive director, Catherine de Bolle, told Politico that the agency had detected an increase in paedophile activity. \u201cWe have huge figures of people abusing child material online,\u201d she said. \u201cWe receive different information from the member states that there is an increased online activity by paedophiles seeking exploitation material.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
