This penultimate episode focuses on houses claiming to be \u201cdown to earth\u201d \u2013 a judgment that turns out, predictably, to be relative. Many of these properties are comparatively simple but all are still probably beyond most viewers\u2019 means. All the same, plenty of attractive, distant property dreams to gaze at. Phil Harrison The Apprentice 9pm, BBC One All manner of entertaining mishaps this week, as the teams devise, design and market their own rollercoasters. Given the bungling that ensues, we can only hope that these rides remain forever hypothetical. Cue pitching nightmares as dreams collide with reality and more boardroom carnage. PH Doc Martin 9pm, ITV After a first half that\u2019s sleepy even by Doc Martin standards, this episode ends with two fine comic set pieces: first, a diagnosis battle with a vet (Caroline Quentin, reunited with her Men Behaving Badly co-star Martin Clunes), and then a layered misunderstanding involving a knife wound. Bloody good fun. Jack Seale Britain\u2019s Lost Masterpieces 9pm, BBC Four Dr Bendor Grosvenor and Emma Dabiri visit Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, where they discover undisplayed and under-celebrated landscapes by Thomas Gainsborough and Pieter Bruegel. Both paintings are a little unloved, but our enthusiastic presenters are always up for a challenge. PH Taskmaster 9pm, Dave The ninth season of this daft and yet oddly endearing comedy challenge concludes. Tonight, in order to win the favour of Greg Davies and Alex Horne, David Baddiel, Ed Gamble, Jo Brand, Katy Wix and Rose Matafeo are challenged to \u201cdo the most preposterous thing with this chickpea\u201d. Their creative solutions are suitably ridiculous. PH Robbing Your Relatives: Families at War 10pm, Channel 5 The documentary strand about relations ripping each other off returns for a second series of grim betrayals retold via thrifty reconstructions. In the opening episode, two Welsh sisters deal with a wicked stepmother, and a Scottish pensioner is the tragic victim of embezzlement. Graeme Virtue Film choice Drive, 10.55pm, Sony Movies One of Ryan Gosling\u2019s star-making roles: in Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s cool and highly stylised 2011 thriller he plays a nameless, nerveless getaway driver. He\u2019s motoring along smoothly until his (sweetly platonic) involvement with neighbour Carey Mulligan gets him fatally mixed up with LA mobsters.
