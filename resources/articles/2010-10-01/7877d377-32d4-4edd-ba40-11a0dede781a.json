Declaring war on motorists", "bodyText": "All right, not an actual war. A national newspaper is not calling for bayonets to be taken to tyres, nor for shotgun-toting mercenaries to patrol NCP car parks. But when the transport secretary, Philip Hammond, declared yesterday that \"We will end the war on motorists\", the obvious question was: what war on motorists? Presumably Mr Hammond is not referring to Gordon Brown's decision 10 years ago to freeze the fuel duty escalator. That decision was only reversed after six years \u2013 and the tiny increases in fuel duty since then mean that, after inflation, the tax remains 11% lower than it was in 1999. Nor did the transport secretary quote his own civil servants' figures, which show that the cost of motoring fell 14% between 1997 and 2009 \u2013 even while rail fares went up 13% and bus and coach ticket prices shot up 24%. What those figures suggest is not so much a war on drivers as a battle against users of public transport. And others who go under their own steam: as the Campaign for Better Transport points out, cities like Luton refuse to reshape their inner ring roads, thus making it harder for pedestrians and cyclists to get into the centre. When autophiles complain that rail travel is as much a middle-class pastime as Glyndebourne, they make the right criticism but draw the wrong conclusion: the answer is to make non-car transport cheaper and more readily available than cars. Harder than it sounds? Sure. But a (non-violent) war on motorists, rather than the current system of preference, would be a start."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
