But he went out of his way to assure the leadership under Kim Jong-un that the regime would not be endangered if it dispensed with its growing nuclear arsenal. \u201cWe do not seek a regime change, we do not seek the collapse of the regime, we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cWe do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th parallel.\u201d The conciliatory tone and the emphasis on dialogue represented a pronounced contrast with Donald Trump, who has become significantly more agitated about North Korea as it continues its tests of long range missiles. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham said he had been told by the president that the regime\u2019s continued development of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the US mainland would lead to war between the two countries. \u201cHe has told me that. I believe him,\u201d Graham told NBC\u2019s Today programme. Tillerson\u2019s tone was also markedly different to Trump\u2019s on China\u2019s role with regard to North Korea, and its failure to pressure North Korea into curbing its weapons programme. \u201cI am very disappointed in China,\u201d Trump tweeted on Sunday. \u201cThey do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!\u201d Speaking at a rare appearance before the press at the state department, Tillerson stressed that while China did have a great deal of potential leverage on Pyongyang, \u201cwe certainly don\u2019t blame China for the situation in North Korea. Only the North Koreans are to blame for this situation.\u201d Such open dissonance between the president and members of his cabinet have become commonplace in the Trump administration. Tillerson conceded he had differences with the president \u2013 citing the example of the nuclear agreement with Iran, which Trump adamantly opposes \u2013 but he presented the divergent views as a plus, and a motivation in his job. \u201cIf we did not have those differences, I would not be serving him,\u201d Tillerson said, giving an insight into the working relationship between the two men. \u201cWe have a good relationship ... He calls me late at night on the weekends,\u201d the secretary of state said. \u201cIt is a very open relationship and it\u2019s one in which I feel quite comfortable telling him my views.\u201d While Trump has delivered ultimatums to North Korea, insisting that it would not develop ICBMs on his watch, Tillerson conceded that the lack of feasible military options gave Washington little choice but to seek a diplomatic solution. \u201cWe initiated a sustained, continued and intensified campaign of what I like to call peaceful pressure because the options available to us ... are limited, particularly if we think we are operating under a short period of time,\u201d said the secretary of state, who will embark on a trip to east Asia later this week. \u201cWe felt the appropriate thing to do first was to seek peaceful pressure on the North Korean regime to have them develop a willingness to sit and talk with us and others, but with the understanding that a condition of those talks is that there is no future in which North Korea holds nuclear weapons or the ability to deliver nuclear weapons to anyone in the region, much less to the homeland.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
