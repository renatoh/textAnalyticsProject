Rooney may not like the idea of taking all his clothes off and submerging himself in water but the Roman baths in this Black Forest town are famed for their healing powers and the Manchester United striker has been instructed to use them to help him back to full fitness. \"The water will be good for Wayne Rooney's injury,\" promised Gassan Schmidt, who runs the 3,000-square metres Caracalla spa. \"We would like him to try our waters for their healing powers. Water is a cure-all with regard to health and many footballers travel long distances to come here when they are injured. It helps all type of sickness and injury and it could be the same for Wayne.\" An old-school manager such as Sir Alex Ferguson may scoff at the idea but England's fitness coach Ivan Carminarti is understood to be taken by the idea and the history books will tell Sven-Goran Eriksson it is worth trying. Caracalla, a Roman emperor, credited Baden-Baden's springs for curing his arthritis while Mark Twain once wrote of the town's 1870s Friedrichsbad spa: \"I firmly believe I left my rheumatism in Baden-Baden. The town is welcome to it.\" Paparazzi shots of Rooney volleying a ball were being touted round Fleet Street for \u00a315,000 yesterday and his integration into training is an encouraging sign before he returns to Manchester tomorrow for another X-ray and the medical bulletin that will determine whether he can play any part in the World Cup. Rooney will be accompanied by the England team doctor Leif Sward while United will be represented by their doctor Tony Gill and the physiotherapist Rob Swire. Sir Alex Ferguson is on holiday but has instructed his medical staff to give him a running commentary. Gary Neville joined Rooney on the sidelines yesterday, still suffering the effects of a tight hamstring, though Eriksson said he expected the defender to take part in their first practice session at SV Buhlertal's Mittelberg Stadium today. David Beckham, John Terry and Ashley Cole were all excused training after suffering minor problems following the match against Jamaica last Saturday but Eriksson emphasised that it was purely a precautionary measure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
