Lots of people are talking about George Clooney\u2019s new television series of the book, but I also recommend to the many people who fear they are being driven crazy by this Brexit nonsense that, at least to my mind, there is no substitute for a return to the original novel. I am reminded of the time when John Major became chancellor of the exchequer after Nigel Lawson\u2019s resignation in October 1989 and I wrote a column based on the character Major Major in Catch-22. Heller was the writer in residence at St Catherine\u2019s College, Oxford, and I sent him a copy out of courtesy. What I did not expect was the sequel. When the New York Times asked Heller to write a satirical piece about the first Gulf war (August 1990 to February 1991) he rather flatteringly delegated the task to me. However nemesis struck when they turned down my effort. I apologised to the great man for letting him down, but he was most generous and we agreed that \u201cwar is not funny at the time\u201d. After all, Catch-22 was published 16 years after the end of the second world war. Nor is this Brexit nonsense funny. Let\u2019s face it: it is crazy. I am reminded of another passage in Catch-22 where Colonel Cargill says: \u201cMen. You\u2019re American officers. The officers of no other army in the world can make that statement. Think about it.\u201d Well, Alexander \u201cBoris\u201d Johnson and Jeremy Hunt: you are the only candidates left to run for the premiership of the United Kingdom. No other politicians can make that statement. What is more, you are competing to take over the reins of government of a once great country on the votes of a mere 160,000 Conservative party members \u2013 in a process neatly described by the aforementioned New York Times as \u201cunrepresentative democracy\u201d. You are vying with each other in an absurd battle of increasingly unrealistic and unrealisable promises. You are evidently prepared \u2013 one of you more than the other \u2013 to take this country out of the European Union on 31 October without even achieving any kind of deal about future arrangements. It is worth repeating the results of a recent YouGov poll which found that the majority of those Conservative party members eligible to vote are so hell-bent on the pursuit of Brexit that they are prepared to contemplate the break-up of the United Kingdom, \u201csignificant damage to the UK economy\u201d and even the collapse of their own party. It is of course worth asking whether some of the puppet-masters of the no-deal brigade are really indulging in self-harm by willing \u201csignificant economic damage\u201d. There could well be economic damage for the many, but there could also be significant offshore tax advantages for rich Brexiters escaping from EU regulatory constraints, as the New European newspaper pointed out just under a year ago. Despite the fact that parliament has voted against no deal, the terrible prospect of overriding the majority of MPs via the device of prorogation has reared its ugly head, and has not been ruled out by Johnson at the time of writing. It is therefore reassuring that Lord Pannick QC \u2013 who was counsel to the campaigner Gina Miller when they successfully challenged Theresa May\u2019s attempt to override parliament in January 2017 \u2013 is firmly of the view that Johnson (for it would probably be he) would be acting unlawfully in urging prorogation upon the Queen. To go back to the wonders of Catch-22: it is my firm belief \u2013 and, I think, that of a growing majority of the electorate if the YouGov research is to be believed \u2013 that we are being rational in regarding Brexit as \u201ca real and immediate\u201d danger to this country. Oh, and by the way: Heller was once asked by a disrespectful interviewer why he had not subsequently written anything as good as Catch-22. To which he replied: \u201cWho has?\u201d Let me finish by quoting a politician who is not to be underrated \u2013 John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor of the exchequer, on the possibility of there being another referendum. \u201cI\u2019d vote for Remain,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t see anything better than what we\u2019ve got at the moment.\u201d I agree."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
