The News Media Association, the trade body for the UK newspaper industry, \u201cfundamentally disagrees\u201d with the corporation\u2019s ambition to grow its online news services, according to its submission to the government green paper on the BBC charter review. The NMA, which represents all the major newspaper publishers except Richard Desmond\u2019s Express group and the Financial Times, is calling on the government to implement 10 changes to the BBC\u2019s objectives and governance. The 10 recommendations include \u201cspecific controls\u201d around the scope of BBC news online, partnerships with news brands instead of replicating content or launching competing services, and more transparency around how licence fee funded overseas journalists are used in the BBC\u2019s commercial international services. \u201cNews brands are successfully making the transition to a sustainable digital world, despite undoubted challenges and risks along the way,\u201d said current NMA chairman Mike Darcey, who is also chief executive of the Sun and Times publisher News UK. \u201cThe BBC must not be given free rein to jeopardise that transition by expanding its local or international news services under the guise of providing a universal solution for a market failure which doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Darcey\u2019s market failure comment refers to the BBC\u2019s claim in a report in January that its expansion is necessary as parts of the UK market, particularly local press, face a bleak future. The NMA says this report \u201cmisreads and overplays the imminent demise of other news media\u201d. \u201cThe BBC\u2019s stated ambition to expand BBC online news provision threatens to crowd out commercial news providers at local, national and international levels,\u201d says the report by Oliver &amp; Ohlbaum. Separately, Darcey, whose role at News Uk has been subject to continued speculation, is due to address the industry at the end of September on the issue of the post-election media landscape. The 69-page NMA report argues that at a local level, the BBC\u2019s drive to create its own suite of local news services across the UK is \u201cunnecessary and risks damaging the local press sector\u201d. At a national level, the report claims that the editorial scope of the BBC\u2019s services are rapidly expanding beyond its core news remit into traditionally commercial editorial areas such as \u2018soft\u2019 news articles, magazine \u2018lifestyle\u2019 content, and celebrity columnists. Internationally, the pressure the BBC is under to commercialise its news service, after being given full funding responsibility for the BBC World Service and extra obligations such as funding licence fees for over-75s, will \u201cexacerbate pressure\u201d for the corporation to compete for advertising and sponsorship outside the UK. \u201cThe BBC\u2019s drive to grow its commercial revenues through its international commercial news operations is likely to impact on other UK news providers who are looking to international markets to sustain and grow their core UK businesses, [such as] the Guardian and the Daily Mail,\u201d the report said. The report says the overall remit creep of the BBC is exacerbated by the huge rise of factual entertainment TV shows, for example the cookery genre like BBC1\u2019s Great British Bake Off, which has led to much more non-news content available for free on the BBC website. \u201cThis is a key issue related to the broadening of the BBC\u2019s online editorial scope in that it blurs the distinction between public service and commercial content,\u201d the report says. \u201cToday, it can be argued that the growth of BBC Online is pushing the BBC into more competition with the commercially funded news sector, both with traditional print businesses going online and with new online start-ups who find the BBC increasingly colonising areas of opportunity such as short- form \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 news via its apps and platform partnerships (e.g. Facebook Instant Articles).\u201d The report proposes that the corporation should be more transparent in how it operates and work on a partnership basis with other news organisations. Methods outlined include the creation of joint ventures or by \u201cmore open trading\u201d of news assets between the BBC and the commercial news sector. The NMA says the BBC should always be under a \u201cspecific obligation\u201d to review its options for partnerships in \u201cexplicit preference\u201d to any expansion of its own online news services. \u201cThe BBC repeatedly seeks to portray itself as a willing partner but all too often fails to deliver,\u201d said NMA vice-chairman Ashley Highfield, the chief executive of regional newspaper publisher Johnston Press. \u201cThe UK\u2019s news media landscape will be best served by a BBC which genuinely collaborates with news media publishers rather than competing with them. This would make better use of the BBC\u2019s stretched resources while allowing space for commercial news media to innovate and thrive.\u201d The report is sceptical of the BBC\u2019s commitment to a co-operative model arguing that there would need to be a new \u201cpublic service oversight body\u201d, or media regulator Ofcom, as a backstop watchdog. For example, the report cites the mediocre success of a BBC pilot programme to improve relations with local newspapers by crediting their stories online when they are lifted by the corporation\u2019s reporters. Regional newspaper groups involved in the initiative have commented that \u201conly a very low volume\u201d of content referrals have resulted from having readers link through from BBC Online. \u201cWithout a clear, externally-regulated co-operation framework for the expansion of its news services, the BBC\u2019s drive to \u2018do more\u2019 risks becoming a contributory factor in the erosion of the wider UK news provision market,\u201d said Mark Oliver, chief executive of O&amp;O. The report estimates that newspaper publishers, in print and online, invest about \u00a31.2bn a year in original journalism and editorial. The BBC is estimated to invest about \u00a3460m in journalism and editorial across TV, radio and online a year. About \u00a3195m of investment comes from commercial TV and radio news providers, most notably ITN and Sky News in TV and IRN in radio. The report estimates that about \u00a365m of content investment comes through a combination of stand-alone online providers in the UK, such as BuzzFeed and Vice Media, and the UK-arms of international news providers such as CNN, al-Jazeera and the New York Times International. A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cThe public think news is the most important service the BBC provides \u2013 we are more trusted and cover stories in the ways others would not. The suggestion that we are overreaching or expanding is misleading \u2013 our share of online news is falling. \u201cA report just last week by Enders Analysis found that the BBC plays no role in exacerbating the challenges newspapers around the world are facing. It concluded scaling back BBC News will irreparably damage a leading UK source of impartial, quality and trusted news, whose independence is valued by users in the UK and around the world. \u201cWe\u2019re doing more than ever to work with local and regional news and will set out our plans to strengthen this new partnership shortly.
