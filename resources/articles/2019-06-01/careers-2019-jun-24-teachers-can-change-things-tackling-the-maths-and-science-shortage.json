Worried about a lack of maths and physics teachers, the government is focusing on finding more and hanging on to them, with a new recruitment and retention strategy launched this year. This supports teachers and offers flexible working. With phased bonuses of up to \u00a310,000, the government hopes to encourage maths teachers to stay on after training \u2013 in total, \u00a3406m is being invested specifically on maths, digital and technical education. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t leave now if you paid me,\u201d says science teacher, Helen Staton, who teaches biology and science in Southampton, Hampshire. She joined via Teach First, a charity that focuses on recruiting for shortage subjects, in 2016. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s about teaching what science actually is,\u201d says Staton. \u201cKids don\u2019t understand the amazing careers available.\u201d But there aren\u2019t enough teachers like Staton. Just half of maths and physics teachers stay on in state schools beyond five years \u2013 that\u2019s worse than the overall retention rate of 60%, a 2018 report from the Education Policy Institute shows. Today, there are more pupils \u2013 now nearly 17 per teacher, up from 15.5 in 2010. By 2025, a population bulge means there\u2019ll be 15% more pupils in secondary schools than in 2018. Not even half of maths and physics teachers hold a relevant degree. \u201cIf it\u2019s not your specialist subject, you\u2019re less able to inspire pupils,\u201d says Dr Rhys Morgan, director of engineering and education at the Royal Academy of Engineering. And this is bad news for engineering. \u201cHalf of all A-level physics students go on to study engineering,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cBut only 20% of A-level physics students are girls. We need to address this early on in schools.\u201d Some universities have dropped the physics requirement for their engineering degrees in order to widen entry to more women, but this risks marginalising physics as a subject in schools, says Morgan. Since 2010, the number of girls taking Stem A-levels has risen 26%, and in the latest intake the government recruited 5,900 science and maths trainees \u2013 up 500 from the previous year. Entries to GCSE computer science are rising faster than for any other subject. But the salaries science and maths teachers earn fall below those of the private sector \u2013 maths teachers in their late 20s earn about \u00a34,000 less than their graduate peers. Engineering companies have a role to play, too, says Baker. And a scheme to bring in teachers to summer work placements has been successful. \u201cIt helps when you can say: \u2018I met a person who did this,\u2019\u201d says Morgan. Teachers are also more likely to stay if their skills are boosted by training \u2013 and Stem Learning\u2019s subject-specific development makes it 160% more likely that science teachers will remain in their profession. \u201cIndustry says we need more engineers,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cBut I believe we need to divert some of them into teaching.\u201d Download our women in engineering supplement (pdf)"}, "isHosted": false}}}
