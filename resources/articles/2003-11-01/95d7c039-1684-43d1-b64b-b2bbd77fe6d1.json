A row broke out when it emerged that pupils from St David's Roman Catholic high school and the non-denominational Dalkeith high were being kept apart at the new Dalkeith schools campus in Midlothian, near Edinburgh. Council bosses insisted the move was necessary to ensure the transition to the new set-up went as smoothly as possible. Donald MacKay, Midlothian council's education director, said pupils would be able to mix freely within the next few weeks. But today, Michael McGrath, director of the Scottish Catholic education service, said: \"The church cannot accept 'integrated' teaching or 'merged' services. 'Integrated' arrangements which diluted the Christian message would be totally unacceptable to the Catholic church. Shared campus arrangements should lead to improved provision of Catholic education not precipitate its demise.\" Mr McGrath was addressing a meeting of the Catholic Primary and Secondary Head Teachers of the Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh in the capital. Speaking in front of the recently appointed Cardinal Keith O'Brien he said he was clarifying the Catholic church's attitude to shared campus arrangements. \"The Catholic philosophy of education can only be fully delivered by teachers who are adequately trained and supported and are themselves committed to it,\" he said. \"Teachers do not impart Gospel values only in programmes of religious education, but throughout the curriculum and across the whole life of the school. Catholic schooling involves developing Catholic values, religious education, spiritual and moral formation and a commitment to serve the common good, all within a supportive climate which affirms the life and dignity of each person,\" he said. Mr McGrath added: \"In an 'integrated' school community, where efforts would be required to be made to suit the wide range of views held by all members, the Christian message would be diluted. For some people, this might be a desirable outcome; for the Catholic community it is totally unacceptable.\" Mr McGrath concluded: \"In all cases where we have agreed to the provision of a Catholic school on a shared campus facility, there has been no acceptance of 'integrated' teaching or 'merged' services which are not under the direction of the Catholic headteacher. Every shared campus Catholic school is expected to have its own staff, its own curriculum and its own ethos and identity.\" The public private partnership funded Dalkeith campus, which opened at the end of last month, caters for around 2,200 pupils. The dining area was divided to keep children from each school in their own specific areas. Pupils have also been kept apart in the playground."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
