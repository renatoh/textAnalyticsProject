It's so irresponsible,\" she told Allure magazine. She could be talking about dropping litter. From her casual tone, you'd think everybody who is polite enough to wash their hands before they cook is popping in for a test every six months. Johansson - voted \"sexiest woman alive\" by Esquire and recipient of Woody Allen's more dubious plaudit that she is \"sexually overwhelming\" - received hallelujahs from the sexual-health world for bringing tests into nice society. The Family Planning Association said she was admirable. The Terrence Higgins Trust praised her as a role model. \"Sexual health is still one of those taboo subjects, but with infections on the rise, it's time we started talking about it,\" said a spokeswoman. \"Prevention is better than cure, especially as some sexually transmitted infections - like HIV - can't be cured.\" But there's the rub. It's one thing to have a regular test for chlamydia, which antibiotics will put right. A positive HIV test, though, is a life sentence. It condemns people, at best, to a lifetime of drug treatment and uncertainty. The people who should have regular tests are those who are putting themselves at risk: those who share needles, those who have had unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex with somebody whose history they are not certain about, and those who have exchanged sex for drugs or money. It would be a smart idea for both partners in any new relationship who decide to have unprotected sex to go for a test first. But if we all start having six-monthly sexual health tests, the clinics are going to collapse. Last year, a study found that up to a quarter of those who fear they could have a highly infectious antisocial disease have to wait two weeks to be seen. So, good for Johansson for tackling the testing taboo. But maybe we should also be talking about the best way for the sexually active to avoid getting infected: use a condom."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
