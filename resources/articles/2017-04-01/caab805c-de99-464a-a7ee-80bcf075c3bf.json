Hopes of reviving the Republicans\u2019 failed healthcare plan surged briefly on Tuesday when the vice-president, Mike Pence, came to Capitol Hill in an attempt to forge a new compromise that could somehow pass the House of Representatives. But the late night talks between Pence and members of competing factions of the House Republican caucus stalled and no deal was reached. A hoped-for repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, returned to the grave and recriminations began anew on Capitol Hill. Chris Collins, a moderate Trump ally from New York, said resignedly that the ball was in the court of the Freedom Caucus, a coalition of arch-conservative legislators who didn\u2019t support the initial Republican healthcare proposal. \u201cWe built them a bridge,\u201d said Collins. \u201cAll they have to do is walk across.\u201d He added, simply: \u201cThe problem is with the Freedom Caucus.\u201d To Collins, this faction within the House GOP had been not been straightforward in negotiating over healthcare in recent days. \u201cIndications \u2026 were on Monday that they wanted to get to yes,\u201d said Collins. \u201cActions speak louder than words and over the past few days, actions would indicate that those words would not have been sincere.\u201d In his opinion, the Freedom Caucus kept on \u201cmoving the goal posts\u201d. Conservatives returned fire. Mo Brooks of Alabama, a member of the Freedom Caucus, noted that House Republicans had voted to totally replace the ACA in 2015 and reluctance to do anything less than that represented a flip-flop. In Brooks\u2019s opinion, those who wanted to preserve parts of the ACA had \u201cnot only moved the goalposts, they\u2019ve taken out the stadium, chopped \u2019em up and burned them\u201d. On Wednesday, conservative groups lashed out at moderate Republicans, blaming them for derailing the latest attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Dan Holler, the vice-president of Heritage Action, said conservatives had already \u201cceded a lot of ground\u201d on fully repealing the healthcare law. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at ways to get our message out,\u201d Holler said in an interview Wednesday, hinting at the possibility of running advertisements in the districts of some moderates. \u201cThe obvious hurdle in the negotiations to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2013 primarily, that is becoming the more moderate wing of the Republican party in the House.\u201d This was echoed by David McIntosh, president of Club for Growth, who said in a statement: \u201cThe leftwing among House Republicans doesn\u2019t want to compromise or keep their pledge to voters to repeal Obamacare.\u201d On Capitol Hill, moderates derided these statements as fundraising ploys. Collins told the Guardian: \u201cThe idea that Club for Growth and Heritage Action is blaming the Tuesday Group and moderates is nothing but a fundraising ploy.\u201d Conservatives remain focused on repealing the regulatory architecture of Obamacare, absent which they argue the fundamentals of the law will stay intact. An agreement, Holler said, was contingent upon \u201cmoderate members doing the things they\u2019ve promised their constituents they would do\u201d. Moderate Republicans have meanwhile balked at the prospect of weakening protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions and enabling insurers to opt out of \u201cessential health benefits\u201d such as maternity care, mental health and substance abuse treatment and emergency services. During a briefing with reporters on Wednesday, the White House legislative affairs director, Marc Short, said there was no set timetable for a new replacement bill but said he was optimistic that Republicans from different wings of the party were finally speaking to each other. \u201cLast night, when we had members of the Freedom Caucus and the Tuesday Group and the RSC in the same room talking through the same issues,\u201d said Short, who is close to Pence and once led Freedom Partners, a key cog in the billionaire Koch brothers\u2019 network, \u201cwe feel like that is progress.\u201d Mark Meadows, the chair of the Freedom Caucus, still claimed there was a path to a bill passing this week, before Congress goes on its Easter recess, telling reporters: \u201cI am still optimistic that everybody is working in good faith and hopefully it will happen this week.\u201d However, he noted: \u201cIt\u2019s important to set realistic expectations that passing a bill between now and Friday is still a Herculean task.\u201d Most other members wrote off the chances of any progress on healthcare reform in the near future. Chris Collins said healthcare was \u201cin trouble\u201d and added: \u201cI don\u2019t really think two weeks at home is going to change anything.\u201d And even the ever-sunny Meadows was willing to concede that things were not looking ideal. \u201cWhenever you get close to a deal, negotiations have [three] phases: it\u2019s called fatal, near-fatal, and definitely fatal,\u201d Meadows said with a smile. \u201cWe\u2019re in the fatal to near-fatal mode. It\u2019s not definitely fatal for at least another 48 hours.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
