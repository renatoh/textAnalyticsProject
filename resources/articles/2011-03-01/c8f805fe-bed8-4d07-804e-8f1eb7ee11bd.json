The two African nations, which are ranked second and fourth respectively in a World Bank list of the world's poorest states, are among 16 countries that will no longer receive bilateral aid from Britain by 2016. Direct aid will also be halted to Lesotho which is ranked 28th on the World Bank list. Burundi, a landlocked country in the unstable Great Lakes region of Africa, is still suffering from the consequences of the Hutu-Tutsi massacres in the 1990s when 200,000 of its citizens died. Niger, a landlocked country in west Africa, depends on foreign aid for half of the government's budget. The cuts were outlined to MPs by Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary, as he unveiled the conclusions of two reviews into Britain's bilateral and multilateral aid programmes. Cutting aid to the 16 countries would allow Britain to concentrate its resources on 27 countries which include Afghanistan, Pakistan and South Africa. Harriet Harman, the shadow international development, challenged Mitchell to explain the cuts to such poor countries. Harman asked: \"Can he confirm that decisions to cut aid to very poor countries like Niger and Lesotho involved co-ordination with other donor countries to make sure that our decisions don't leave them literally high and dry? Can I also ask him to explain his decision to end aid to Burundi where there is deep poverty and which is in the Great Lakes region where there is still instability?\" Mitchell admitted that tough decisions had been made. \"I will confirm that other donors were involved in the decision [about Niger]. We decided that it was not appropriate to keep a bilateral programme in Niger. Much of the work that is being done in Niger, which is in an enormously food insecure part of the world, is done on a multilateral basis. Last year I agreed specific support on a humanitarian basis to feed 810,000 people. \"We are very much engaged in Niger on a humanitarian basis but we look to other countries to share the burden. We strongly support the multilateral architecture in addressing the position in Niger.\"Mitchell admitted that the decision on Burundi was tough: \"We had a very small programme there. We judged that it was right to close it. These are tough and difficult decisions. We thought we could spend the money better elsewhere. But TradeMark East Africa, which we very strongly support, will be based there as well and wiring them into the regional infrastructure is extremely important.\" Mitchell said the reviews were designed to ensure better value for money and to target resources at achieving key goals over the next four years. These include: \u2022 Securing schooling for 11 million children \u2013 far higher than the number of children educated in the UK but at 2.5% of the cost. \u2022 Vaccinating more children against preventable diseases than the number of children in England. \u2022 Saving the lives of 50,000 women in pregnancy and childbirth. Mitchell said: \"Aid can perform miracles but it must be well spent and properly targeted. The UK's development programme has now been reshaped and refocused so that it can meet that challenge.\" As part of the review Britain is to save \u00a350m by cutting discretionary payments to four multilateral organisations. Britain will withdraw from the UN Industrial Development Organisation and will stop voluntary core funding to UN Habitat, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. Labour MPs reacted angrily to the decision to withdraw discretionary funding to the ILO. Denis MacShane, the former Europe minister, was highly critical of Mitchell who used to work for Lazard bank. \"This attack on the ILO will horrify every trade union worker around the world. Britain founded the ILO, in the 1980s it was central to getting rid of Soviet communism and apartheid South Africa,\" said MacShane. \"I know the secretary of state has to represent Lazard and the bankers' community - but this attack on working people around the world is shameful.\"Mitchell said: \"The decision on the ILO was a recommendation from the multilateral aid review. It says in the professional analysis that the ILO has a wide range of organisational weaknesses, including weak cost control and results reporting and limited transparency.\" Ethiopia will become the biggest recipient of bilateral aid over the next two years. Pakistan could become the biggest recipient of British aid within three years, with a major focus on education, British officials in Islamabad said, but only if the government reduces chronic corruption. Just 56% of Pakistani children between five and nine years' old attend primary school, a rate that British officials want to boost to the world average of 87%. But the school system is chronically dysfunctional due to political interference, \"ghost schools\" and unqualified teachers. \"It's an education emergency,\" said one official. As well as reducing graft, British officials want to see Pakistan increase its tax collection, currrently at a disastrously low rate of nine per cent of GDP with many parliamentarians paying little tax. The Pakistani government has vowed to improve education spending from two per cent GDP to seven per cent. British officials said they recognised that British aid was a \"drop in the bucket\" in a country of 180 million people, but hoped that a targeted aid programme could \"catalyse change\" in critical areas like education. Direct financial transfers to the Pakistani exchequer, which amounted to \u00a3120 million over four years under the last aid programme, are likely to be scrapped, officials said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
