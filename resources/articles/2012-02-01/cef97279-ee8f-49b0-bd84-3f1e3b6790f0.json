For Keane, it actually made them less worthy of respect, his reasoning being that if they could lift their game against United, not doing so week in week out against lesser clubs meant that in his words, they were basically cheating their manager. It was tempting to wonder if similar thoughts crossed the mind of any of the Leicester City players as they celebrated in front of their supporters at Carrow Road on Saturday. Position for position, most cost Leicester more to buy than their opposite number cost Norwich City \u2014 in some cases, a lot more. In many respects it is not the fact that Leicester, lying 13th in the Championship, beat Norwich, lying eighth in the Premier League, which is remarkable: it is that they are in those positions in the first place. In the circumstances it would be churlish to criticise the Norwich manager, Paul Lambert, for resting four top performers in Grant Holt, John Ruddy, Andrew Surman and Kyle Naughton, though with 13 league games remaining to secure the three or four points that should end any threat of relegation, such caution seemed excessive. So much so that just perhaps the Europa League is in the back of his mind, though you would have to put the Scot on the rack before he would admit to entertaining such a prospect. \"I picked a team I thought would win, so we're disappointed, but the main thing is the Premier League,\" he said. \"I'm pretty sure people wouldn't thank me if we got to the semi-finals, got knocked out, and got relegated \u2014 I don't think they would be patting me on the back.\" Whether Leicester City's big-spending Thai owners will pat Nigel Pearson on the back if he guides the Foxes to an FA Cup final but not into the promotion play-offs is an interesting question. The manager's pleasure in a performance which combined effort and quality in equal measure was tempered by frustration that his team does not consistently attain a similar level in the Championship. \"I'm very pleased for the players and for the fans, and I hope it can be a springboard for us to get into the play-offs but it's been said a few times this season and there's been a few false dawns in that regard,\" said Pearson, dryly. It may not have been a complete coincidence that Leicester's two best players on Saturday, Lloyd Dyer and Neil Danns, arrived at the club on free transfers, but the whole team applied themselves. They had to, because while Norwich had been deprived of some of their usual quality, they worked hard and had most of the luck that was going. In fact when Leicester's goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel was adjudged to have fouled Elliott Bennett in the box, a harsh decision in itself, and then brilliantly saved Wes Hoolahan's spot-kick only for the same player to turn in the rebound, it did not look as though it was going to be Leicester's day. The more so when Wes Morgan's attempt was kept out by Elliott Ward's chest when the defender clearly had both feet a long way behind the goalline. But having taken the lead through Sean St Ledger's early header, the visitors kept believing, and thoroughly deserved David Nugent's well taken second-half winner. When it was pointed out to Pearson that Leicester won at Norwich on their way to the 1963 Cup Final, he smiled. \"The year I was born. When you get to the quarter-finals people start dreaming and there are some big teams no longer in the competition, but we have an awful lot of hard work to do in the league to try and rectify the position we find ourselves in first,\" he said.
