Her venues have \u201cbeen given their mojo back\u201d, she said, despite a lockdown that will keep them dark until at least the first week of December. Burns welcomed audiences back to the Apollo in London last month with a short run for Adam Kay\u2019s hit show about the NHS, This Is Going to Hurt. That production closed early due to the new lockdown restrictions, which have led to the postponed reopening of other shows at her company Nimax\u2019s six West End venues, including The Play That Goes Wrong and the musicals Six and Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie. Extending furlough would be \u201cincredibly helpful for business planning and for people\u2019s mental health\u201d, said Burns. But she appealed for the government to give theatres as much advance notice as possible in the coming weeks about when they can reopen. Boris Johnson\u2019s last-minute announcement, on Saturday, of a one-month extension to the furlough scheme, was followed by Sunak\u2019s further extension on Thursday. Uncertainty had left theatres frustrated and unable to make long-term plans, said Burns. \u201cIt would have been a great deal better had the extension to furlough been announced sooner because so many companies were already in the redundancy process.\u201d Within 48 hours of Johnson\u2019s announcement, Burns\u2019s theatres had rescheduled all their shows. \u201cWe are looking forward and trying to stay positive,\u201d she said, emphasising that they had seen no dip in audience confidence despite the start of another lockdown. The vast majority of customers had exchanged their tickets for a later date rather than asked for a refund. \u201cIf I could have a dream scenario now, we would be able to reopen in December and they\u2019d let us know in two weeks\u2019 time,\u201d said Burns. \u201cAnd also we\u2019d get a not-earlier-than date to reopen without social distancing before the end of the year.\u201d Burns was referring to the long-awaited date for stage five of culture secretary Oliver Dowden\u2019s theatre roadmap. Also vital for reopening major West End ensemble shows, she said, is the introduction of a government-backed insurance scheme. A significant number of winter theatre productions around England are poised to open, said the producer, but they would need to decide this month about going into rehearsals and have sufficient time to prepare. Burns stressed the importance of pantos being staged \u201cin the regions in particular [where it is] a large part of the community\u201d. Local theatres are at the heart of towns and cities, she added, and getting people back into them was vital, not just for those venues\u2019 coffers. Although many of England\u2019s beleaguered theatres have received emergency funding from the government, the second lockdown has brought severe challenges. Several theatres that had planned to welcome reduced capacity audiences, such as Home in Manchester and Southwark Playhouse in London, will now stream their shows online instead. On Wednesday, Oldham Coliseum announced that it will remain closed until 2021. The venue had planned a season of Covid-secure, socially distanced events for November but said: \u201cWe do not know for certain whether theatres will be permitted to reopen on 2 December, what the tier system will mean for the Coliseum, or if \u2013 as reported \u2013 the national lockdown is extended beyond that date.\u201d Jon Morgan, the director of the Theatres Trust, welcomed the extension of the furlough scheme but stressed that even once lockdown has been lifted many venues will not be able to viably open with socially distanced audiences. \u201cFor those theatres in areas returning to tiers 2 and 3 after lockdown, where other night-time businesses will be closed and travel severely restricted,\u201d he added, \u201creopening will be doubly challenging. Extending the job retention scheme is a lifeline for theatres and we would like to see it remain in place until stage five when theatres can welcome fuller audiences and reopen viably.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
