Few albums have fulfilled their intended purpose faster. Future Nostalgia was meant to arrive today, until an online leak brought it forward to the first Friday of Britain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown. Lipa wasn\u2019t sure it felt right to release it during the pandemic, but accurately concluded that her brilliant disco-wreathed anthems-in-waiting \u2013 the kind that transform kitchen tiles into a makeshift Studio 54 \u2013 might distract fans from the news. At the very least, a day of radio interviews and unceasing congrats stopped the 24-year-old from stressing about when to take her government-sanctioned daily walk. We FaceTime in the early evening of Future Nostalgia\u2019s premature birthday, Lipa at ease in a Christopher Kane \u201cTechno Sexual\u201d jumper, modish straw-on-tarmac hair tied up, saucer eyes unadorned. Like everyone, she has been self-isolating, eating chips and watching Tiger King. Unlike everyone, she is doing it in a plush Airbnb (her London flat flooded) with her model boyfriend Anwar Hadid (brother of models Gigi and Bella). Later, she will be conference-calling friends and family to \u201cdrink and dance through the phone\u201d. Although Lipa says today has felt like Christmas, it is still an anticlimactic arrival for an album that the British music industry has been banking on. Hers is the rare homegrown success not belonging to anyone named Sheeran or Adele, born from no-nonsense mega-pop in the vein of Britney and her idol Pink. In 2017, Lipa was the most-streamed female musician in the world. A year later, she became the first female solo artist to get five Brits nominations (she won two), and the youngest woman to break 1bn YouTube views with her video for New Rules, the single that transformed her from pop journeywoman to superstar. This January, it hit 2bn. Success creates freedom and pressure, says Lipa. At 11 tracks, the focused Future Nostalgia bucks pop\u2019s trend for bloated, spread-betting albums that try to please all-comers. But her initial intention for the record \u2013 to have fun and ignore the world \u2013 came after online criticism threatened to dent her self-worth. \u201cPeople almost made me feel bad about my achievements, or didn\u2019t allow me to feel proud of the things that I\u2019ve done because they made me feel like I was almost unworthy of them,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though I know I\u2019ve worked really hard and I did so much of the work, the performances and behind the scenes.\u201d There are two key words here, the first being \u201calmost\u201d: Lipa is indomitable, not given to vulnerability, or at least not to showing it. The second is \u201cwork\u201d: Lipa\u2019s parents are Kosovar-Albanian Muslim immigrants who fled war-torn Kosovo for the UK in 1992. She was born in 1995, and lived in London until the family returned to Pristina when she was 10. At 15, she came back to pursue pop stardom, persuading her parents she would have a better chance of getting into a British university if she finished school here. Where most kids would go wild, Lipa grafted, pestered people with her demos and became an assiduous networker (the Instagram page for Girls Collective, a DIY talent agency she started with five friends, is still live). One connection led to another and she signed first with Lana Del Rey\u2019s management team, then to Warner Music. It took two years from releasing her debut single, New Love \u2013 showing off her trademark bungee-jump vocals and ex-vanquishing MO \u2013 to her first album. The latter was repeatedly delayed, Lipa a prime study of how pop careers build slowly and evolve publicly in the streaming era \u2013 and living proof of the \u201cadaptability\u201d she admired in her parents. \u201cWith every song, the momentum was building, but only tiny little bits,\u201d she says. \u201cI was doing new things, I was learning what was expected of me, how to be in front of a camera, how to better the last performance.\u201d But her singles were not charting well. By the time she released two successive collaborations \u2013 modern pop\u2019s stabilisers \u2013 fans worried she was destined for pop\u2019s dumper. Then she unleashed the video to New Rules, \u201cand it was like rocket fuel\u201d, she says, a feminist sleepover fever dream and instant classic. It takes place in a luxury Miami Beach hotel, which she approached to fund the video, not because her label had shut its wallet, but in a savvy cash grab that let her \u201cpush it to another level\u201d. She never doubted her career prospects. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think it was gonna happen like this.\u201d Reflecting pop\u2019s long game, Lipa won the Grammy for best new artist in 2019. The backlash took flight. \u201cPeople being like: \u2018She\u2019s been fucking best new artist for so long and she doesn\u2019t deserve that, blah blah blah,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThere were times that I felt people were being so mean that when someone recognised me and said: \u2018I really like your music,\u2019 I\u2019d be like: \u2018Oh my God, not everyone hates me!\u2019\u201d She says this with self-aware melodrama, though it echoes recent sentiments from Billie Eilish and Britney Spears: how dismal it must feel to see your hard work burned up by hatred. Lipa hopes the #BeKind movement sparked by Caroline Flack\u2019s death might improve online discourse. \u201cThe scrutiny not just on social media but in the media, especially towards women, is so intense and unkind and really trying to get a rise out of people,\u201d she says. \u201cThe tabloids know very well what they\u2019re doing, and it really affects everyone. You have to be made out of steel to not let words get to you. It\u2019s so sad that we have to learn lessons from somebody\u2019s death.\u201d But then, maybe we are a long way off when, as Lipa says, \u201ccertain leaders are inciting racism and almost making it acceptable for people to be racist and treating people in very vile and disgusting ways\u201d. British political parties are \u201cabsolutely\u201d sowing such division, she says. \u201cYou have people like Nigel Farage, who is very openly racist and that is just shocking, and there are people who beat around the bush. They\u2019re racist but \u2013 it\u2019s such a mindfuck \u2013 they have a lot of people fooled.\u201d Lipa is unusually specific about politics for a pop star of her stature. It\u2019s not just \u201cvote\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cvote Labour\u201d, or \u201cvote Bernie\u201d, or \u201cFUCK THE PATRIARCHY I AM DONE WITH THIS BULLSHIT HANDMAIDS TALE SHIT WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK\u201d after Alabama banned abortion. She credits her parents for her voice, saying she was raised \u201creally liberal\u201d. She is most concerned about UK immigration policy post-Brexit. Had it existed in the 90s, she thinks it would have stopped the Lipas fleeing Kosovo (where her mum was a lawyer, her dad a dentist-in-training) for the UK, where they worked as waiters and studied for new careers. \u201cIt upsets me that probably some of the younger generations of refugees don\u2019t really have the same opportunities that I was given because of the fortunate \u2013 or unfortunate \u2013 fact that my parents moved to London and I was born here and able to live my dream and do something on a global scale,\u201d she says. Whether post-Brexit Britain still offers those opportunities, \u201cwe\u2019re gonna have to see how everything works out\u201d, she says cautiously. Brexit has been upsetting: \u201cBeing from Kosovo, I know what it would mean for them to be a part of the EU and be accepted.\u201d It is an obvious thing to say about someone who frequently entertains packed arenas, but Lipa evidently wants to be heard. Although she occasionally jumps into the conversational deep end but grips the safety rail (a devout Labour supporter, she indicates that she is no Corbyn fan, but won\u2019t say so outright), she sticks to her chosen guns. She kept Future Nostalgia relatively short to hold listeners\u2019 attention spans. \u201cI really wanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t any tracks you could skip,\u201d she grins. Pop\u2019s detractors like to point out that it is an industry where artists conform to conventions. In the immortal words of Eilish: duh. Lipa is a canny operator who understood that she had to play a certain game to reach the point where she could be herself. (Her ambition/achievement conversion rate is a big part of her aspirational appeal.) Lipa was surprised by the under-recognition of female talent at this year\u2019s Brits \u2013 evidence, critics said, of the British industry\u2019s inability to develop female talent \u2013 but she is pragmatic about what might seem like a conservative feeder system where new acts spew out singles and accept every possible collaboration. \u201cArtists that are already well known get the upper hand, so you do have to get on those playlists as much as possible to be heard,\u201d she says. Following Lipa\u2019s success, one such feeder system seemed to be getting young female acts to make their version of New Rules: Mabel\u2019s Don\u2019t Call Me Up, Ella Eyre\u2019s New Me and Anne-Marie\u2019s Friends to name just three. (Incidentally, New Rules is the only one of Lipa\u2019s songs that she hasn\u2019t had a hand in writing.) She must have noticed. \u201cEr, have I noticed \u2026? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve noticed \u2026\u201d she says, her game face dropping to reveal that she has absolutely noticed. \u201cBut that\u2019s OK, though!\u201d she says when called on it. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of different ways to say the same thing, make it honest and unique to you.\u201d She resists the idea that anyone is being told to recreate someone else\u2019s success. \u201cArtists do have a lot of control.\u201d Had Lipa tried to recreate New Rules for album two, \u201cI\u2019d just be in a vicious cycle\u201d, she says. She says she struggled to find her \u201clyrical language\u201d on her debut, feeling more at ease writing sad songs. \u201cI learned that I could write happy songs that are still really authentic and have the possibility of being cool and not seen as bubblegum.\u201d Most striking is how she sings about sex: mutually pleasurable, orgasmic transcendence mirrored in dazzling disco reveries. On Good in Bed, she nonchalantly celebrates \u201call that good pipe in the moonlight\u201d from a toxic ex-with-benefits. \u201cEverybody thinks that as a woman, you have to be so careful about how you portray yourself or how you talk about sex, and everything has to be really sweet,\u201d she says mockingly. \u201cIt\u2019s just very colloquial and how I chat with my mates.\u201d Future Nostalgia ends with its lone ballad, the weighty Boys Will Be Boys, where a children\u2019s choir backs Lipa singing about how girls grow up faster in a world of male violence. She wanted to make something that felt like the moment the lights go on at the end of a party, \u201cso it would almost end a bit abruptly and maybe make you feel uncomfortable\u201d. She has grown less accommodating, a dynamic she dealt with in real life in January, when she attended Lizzo\u2019s Grammys afterparty at an LA strip club. After they were filmed throwing money at dancers with Rosal\u00eda, Lipa was accused of exploiting women, sparking the hashtag #dualipaisoverparty where users revelled in her \u201ccancellation\u201d. Lipa \u2013 who no longer goes on Twitter \u2013 did not respond. \u201cI don\u2019t like to apologise if I don\u2019t believe I should be apologising for something,\u201d she says now. \u201cI believe in supporting women in all fields of work. Nothing at that party was derogatory; everyone was just dancing and having fun.\u201d In our supposedly enlightened culture about sex work, she was surprised by the prudish response. \u201cThat\u2019s something we all have to work on,\u201d she says. \u201cNot every sex worker is being forced to do something they don\u2019t wanna do. I think a lot of the women found it really empowering and really like to dance.\u201d Women\u2019s work is always undermined, says Lipa. \u201cWe all have to work a little bit harder to be taken seriously, but it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re not used to doing,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes and grinning. She has pointedly described Future Nostalgia as \u201cfun\u201d even though she knows that is exactly the stick critics use to beat it with; that women in pop are only judged as \u201cauthentic\u201d when they are weeping by the piano. \u201cTime always tells,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cAnd in the meantime, I\u2019ll just work for people to take me seriously.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 3 and 7 April 2020. Dua Lipa\u2019s debut single was New Love, not Hotter Than Hell as an earlier version said. This article was further amended because Lipa\u2019s parents are both Kosovar-Albanian, not Kosovan and Bosnian as previously stated. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
