They also asked Newsom to tour San Quentin, the historic state prison that has seen the most positive cases. Almost 1,500 people at San Quentin tested positive for the virus, and seven people have succumbed to complications from Covid-19. The facility has seen an exponential rise in coronavirus cases \u2013 up until the end of May it had not recorded a single confirmed case. In a sign of an escalating crisis, officials reported in the past week that five people on the prison\u2019s death row had died from complications related to Covid-19 . One of the men died in his cell, the other four in nearby hospitals. The most recent losses of life bring the total number of Covid-19-related deaths in California state prisons to 31. Advocates, attorneys and public health experts say that these deaths were preventable, and that the state\u2019s administration could prevent further deaths by releasing thousands of prisoners. \u201cI heard Governor Newsom say this is his top priority, but does he care?\u201d said James King, an activist with the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights who was formerly incarcerated. \u201cPeople in there feel abandoned, as if no one cares that they\u2019re left do die.\u201d The Newsom administration and California\u2019s prison system (CDCR) have come under intense pressure over the spread of the coronavirus among prisoners, with lawmakers lambasting the official response. In May, prison authorities transferred 187 people at high risk of contracting Covid-19 from the California Institution for Men (CIM) in Chino to San Quentin and Corcoran state prisons. Before the transfer, San Quentin had zero positive cases and Corcoran had one. Within three weeks of the transfer, the prisons had nearly 500 and 150 cases respectively. Then in mid-June prison authorities transferred more people from San Quentin to the California correctional center in Lassen county, where positive Covid-19 cases leapt from zero to 211 within a week. \u201cThis is nothing short of the worst health screw-up in state history,\u201d said the California assemblyman Marc Levine at Thursday\u2019s press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable to treat the people in our care and custody so carelessly, with such destruction to their health. \u201cThere must be accountability,\u201d he added. The corrections system\u2019s top medical official was removed on 6 July to \u201cmeet current response needs while also working toward further delegation of medical care back to state control\u201d, the former federal receiver J Clark Kelso said in a statement. Federal judges, including Judge Jon S Tigar, who is one of three judges overseeing a years-long lawsuit to reduce the California prison population, have argued that the prison outbreaks can spell disaster in and outside of correctional facilities. \u201cThe failure to act will cause an inevitable and unnecessary loss of life \u2013 not just in California\u2019s incarcerated population, but also among CDCR staff and those beyond institutional walls who interact with staff or their households on a daily basis,\u201d Tigar wrote in a 5 July order. Newsom has said that he will be reviewing new cases and has a plan to bring the population in San Quentin down to 3,076 people. As of 10 June, San Quentin had 3,551 people and was at 115% capacity. \u201cThe US is addicted to mass incarceration,\u201d said Boudin, the San Francisco DA. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take Covid to teach us that this is not safe. We\u2019ve known for years that locking people up steals resources from our schools and hospitals. It forces kids to grow up without families. \u201cWe have the tools, the data, the leadership and community support, but do we have the commitment and compassion to save lives?\u201d he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
