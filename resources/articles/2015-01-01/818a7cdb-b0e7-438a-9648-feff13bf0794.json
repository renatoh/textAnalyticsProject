Jones, 33, who made 95 appearances for Wales, winning three Grand Slams, said that he made up his mind before Christmas that if he was not chosen for the Six Nations he would retire. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously not the way I would want to finish, it\u2019s not how I planned it, and I hope no one thinks I am simply quitting,\u201d he told The Sunday Times. Jones acknowledged his Test career had been far from plain sailing of late, having missed out on the autumn international series and not playing for his country since June 2014. \u201cIt started when I got dropped for the last game of the 2014 Six Nations [against Scotland],\u201d he said. \u201cI was still pretty happy with the way everything was going, and I was thinking that I\u2019d get back in. Then there was the \u201830-minute match\u2019 in South Africa [when he was replaced by Samson Lee after half an hour].\u201d Jones had been put on standby for the Six Nations and told by the coach Warren Gatland that the door remained open for a comeback, but the player said he had decided late last year that he would hang up his Test boots if overlooked. \u201cI was gutted to miss out on the autumn,\u201d the 2009 and 2013 British and Irish Lion added. \u201cI told myself then that I would train as hard as I can and get as fit as I can. If it didn\u2019t happen, then I\u2019ll call it a day.\u201d Jones does not agree with Gatland\u2019s decision to overlook him, but thanked the Wales coach for being a \u201cmassive influence\u201d on his career. \u201cWarren is the man who came in and saved me,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe gave me a kick up the [backside] so he\u2019s been a massive influence on me, and I\u2019m very grateful. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with what he\u2019s done now, I don\u2019t agree with him not picking me. But he\u2019s got to pick who he thinks is best.\u201d Jones will continue playing for Cardiff Blues, who he joined on a one-year deal in August 2014."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
