Swansea\u2019s manager is aware that his team could be five points adrift by the time they kick-off at home against Everton on Saturday night, with Marco Silva\u2019s side hosting Sunderland earlier in the day, yet he is convinced that his players have \u201cturned a corner\u201d in recent weeks and is confident they can escape the threat of relegation if they win successive home games for the first time in 12 months. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do the business [against Everton],\u201d Clement said. \u201cGot to get a good result. Got to keep that pressure on. The fact that they\u2019ve then got Crystal Palace and then Tottenham; we\u2019ve got Sunderland and then West Brom \u2026 but we\u2019ve got to do the job against Everton, we\u2019ve got to focus on that.\u201d With Premier League safety Hull\u2019s to lose, Clement talked about the need for Swansea \u201cto use that [situation] to our advantage\u201d. Clement\u2019s main concern, though, is that his players maintain the standards set in the last two fixtures. \u201cWe haven\u2019t spoken about chasing; we\u2019ve just spoken about the need to start performing better, because after the way we played against West Ham and Watford, if we continued playing like that, there was only going to be one outcome. \u201cThankfully we have turned that corner and performed well, four points out of Stoke at home and Manchester United away is a good return. And it could have been six points, so now why can\u2019t we go into Everton and take all three points?\u201d Hull\u2019s match against Sunderland will finish roughly 40 minutes before Swansea kick-off and Clement is realistic enough to know that \u201ceveryone is going to know\u201d the result in his dressing room. \u201cWhether Hull win, lose or draw, we\u2019ve still got to win. If they win, we\u2019ve got to keep the gap the same. If they draw or lose, we\u2019ve got to take advantage, so it stays the same for us,\u201d he said. Clement is expected to retain the midfield diamond that has served Swansea well, which means Jordan Ayew will once again partner Fernando Llorente up front. Ayew is still looking for his first goal since arriving from Aston Villa in January, yet the Ghanaian has impressed alongside Llorente, with Clement reporting that the striker\u2019s \u201cphysical statistics were almost off the chart\u201d against Stoke and saying they were \u201cthe same again against Man United\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s come close [to a goal],\u201d Clement added. \u201cHe had two good opportunities against Stoke. There was one where it hit the inside of [Jack] Butland\u2019s heel and on any other day that would have gone in. At Man United he had a couple of good chances. I\u2019m sure that will come and it will be the icing on the cake because he\u2019s doing a lot of things right.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
