Or at least not in the format it chose to use yesterday. On a circuit which measures just under 1.2 miles, necessitating a race distance of 165 laps, the powers that be decided that each driver would make only two mandatory pit stops. The problem was that the limited capacity of the cars left the drivers having to conserve fuel to ensure they made it to the next stop, and an extra stop would cost too much time on such a short circuit. They could not drive flat out because to do so would use too much fuel, and the result was a procession as boring as anything produced by formula one. Ever. It was hardly the way to help spread the gospel of Cart - Championship Auto Racing Teams - around the globe, which was the reason they were here - and at Rockingham in the past two years. \"The race was about who saved more fuel, not who went faster,\" shrugged the Brazilian Bruno Junqueira, who finished second to his Newman-Haas team-mate S\u00e9bastien Bourdais. \"It's a good track for the drivers but we need to change the rules.\" Like Bourdais he calculated he had made only four overtaking moves throughout the race, all when lapping back markers. Mario Dominguez, who finished third for Herdez Racing, reckoned he had passed only two cars, and described the experience as like racing 800hp cars on a kart track. Darren Manning, the sole Briton on the grid, finished 10th after providing one of the day's more interesting moments when he slid off attempting to overtake. He was able to attempt it only because he had had to make an unexpected third pit stop and so had enough fuel to put his foot down. \"The cars just didn't get a chance to stretch their legs out there,\" said the Yorkshireman. \"That's a big shame because, believe me, they're great at slip-streaming. We had to come here to show what we could do, show the quality of the drivers and teams, but maybe it would have been better to use the grand prix circuit.\" Clearly it would, but Cart was promoting this race itself and the money was not there to prepare Brands Hatch's longer track. \"Did we miss the mark today? In some ways, yes,\" admitted Adam Saal, Cart's communications chief. Given that the two-stop rule was decided upon by Cart's board of directors, which includes representatives from all the teams, no individual is likely to carry the can for what can only be described as a shambles. It would have been interesting to talk to the Cart president Chris Pook, but he left shortly after the race. In fact it is far from certain the financially troubled series has a future at all. Falling television ratings, ferocious competition from numerous other formulas and the straitened US economy means Cart is losing money hand over fist. If Pook is hoping that the formula one supremo Bernie Ecclestone may yet come riding to the rescue, yesterday's British leg of the series did him no favours. Ecclestone is not known for spending the smallest part of his fortune without the prospect of a serious return. The half an hour before the start of the race was far more interesting than the half an hour after it. A fan was picked from the crowd to put a question to Manning as he stood by his car in the moments before the start. An unfortunate choice, as it turned out; \"When are you going to get into formula one?\" asked Stuart from Eltham. Required to think fast, Manning made the best of it. \"I like this better. They're too hard-nosed in F1; they never come and say hello to you guys,\" he replied. There was nothing wrong with the razzmatazz, the \"Americana\" as Pook called it. The honorary grand marshals Damon Hill, Mario Andretti and Emerson Fittipaldi chorused the customary \"Gentlemen, start your engines\", the race began and, for almost 50 laps, 18 cars lapped in perfect formation. Only after the pit stops began was the field mixed enough to provide some occasional excitement. Alex Yoong, as formula one fans will recall, can usually be relied on to mess things up at some point, and duly crashed out. It looked as though the Canadian Paul Tracy would win his fourth race of the season for Players Forsythe Racing until his Cosworth engine blew up, leaving Bourdais and Junqueira to lead the field home. The crowd, estimated perhaps a fraction optimistically at just under 40,000, watched in some bemusement. Having been promised wheel-to-wheel racing and constant overtaking, they were entitled to feel let down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
