Local star Meron Getnet, who\u2019s terrific, co-stars as Hirut\u2019s pro-bono lawyer Meaza Ashenafi, a feisty modern woman who won\u2019t give up the fight against patriarchal tradition. It\u2019s tempting to give this more of a pass because the subject is so noble and so few African-made films make it over here, but it has to be admitted that the some of the acting is a bit ropey and the script is a little too on-the-nose at times. There really is a scene where our heroine Meaza goes to a bar to get drunk at her darkest hour just before good news comes through. On the other hand, it\u2019s hard not to stifle a tear at the emotional climax, and cinematographer Monika Lenczewska does a particularly handsome job evoking the milieu."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
