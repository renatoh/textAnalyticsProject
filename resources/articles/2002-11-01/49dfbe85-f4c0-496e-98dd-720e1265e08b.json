That, however, will not only require a Newcastle victory here - something neither Juventus nor Dynamo Kiev could manage - but also a Juventus win or draw far and away in Ukraine. Given that the Italian champions have progress ensured and have an away record in Europe reminiscent of West Ham's at Upton Park this season, not many are expecting Juve to over-extend themselves. Bert van Marwijk, the Feyenoord coach, said that Marcello Lippi would take a second-string squad to Kiev because of the group's circumstances, something Marwijk said he would do if in the same position. Sure enough, Alessandro Del Piero, Pavel Nedved and Lilian Thuram among others have been left in Turin. No wonder \"No, not really\" was Alan Shearer's response when asked if he thought Juve would do Newcastle a favour. Unless what is widely expected does not occur, Feyenoord and Newcastle are playing for third place in the group and a consolation spot in the Uefa Cup. But Feyenoord offer a vivid example to Sir Bobby Robson's players of just how significant a consolation that can be. At this point last year Feyenoord needed to beat Spartak Moscow here to go into the Uefa Cup. They did, and went on to win the final in May, played in the same De Kuip Stadium against Borussia Dortmund. Not only was this a triumph in itself - Feyenoord's first European trophy since 1974 - but it brought with it a financial bonus: Van Marwijk did not have to sell any players last summer. Jon Dahl Tomasson did leave for Milan, but that was on a Bosman free. For Newcastle, whose only European triumph was in the old Fair's Cup in 1969, the stimulus of silverware is something the club needs badly. For Robson, a man well versed in the prestige of Europe, the thought of finishing third in the group would only be a relative failure. \"The Uefa Cup would be a terrific crumb of comfort for us,\" Robson said. \"It would be a saviour for us, marvellous, and something we have to play for. Feyenoord, having won the competition last year, will know the importance of it - perhaps more than us. It's a huge, huge game. The prize is quite enormous, and we can't worry what's going to happen in Kiev.\" Robson said that he wants Newcastle to set the pace tonight. That may well mean Craig Bellamy beginning the game rather than sitting on the bench. \"He's trained for eight or nine days in a row,\" the Newcastle manager said of the Wales striker, who has been out for three weeks after sustaining a knee injury. \"He trained again today with no discomfort and we haven't brought him here not to play some part.\" There were moments in training last night, though, when Bellamy looked somewhat tentative But Bellamy alongside Shearer again would certainly boost the Geordies and worry the Dutch in the stadium where Robson won the Cup-Winners' Cup with Barcelona in 1997.
