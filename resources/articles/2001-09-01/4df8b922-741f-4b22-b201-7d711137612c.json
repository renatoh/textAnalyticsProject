After all, if you never run up debts on which you'll incur interest, your quest for a good deal should focus on cards that combine a long interest-free period - 46 to 59 days is common - with an attractive loyalty scheme. Some 29 credit cards now offer loyalty schemes, which reward you each time you use them with incentives such as cash bonuses, air miles or discount points which can be realised against various goods from supermarket shopping to holidays and cars. Liz Chettleburgh, credit card editor at best buy table provider Moneyfacts, selects six cards as being good examples of various types of loyalty schemes. Each of them offers a reasonable interest-free period and none charge an annual fee. The Boots Advantage card (APR 14.9%) earns you up to five Advantage points per \u00a31 spent on purchases in Boots stores and one point per \u00a31 spent on purchases elsewhere, plus a bonus of 1,000 points when you open an account. Points are redeemable against products in Boots stores at a rate of \u00a31 per \u00a3100 spent on the card. The Egg card (standard APR 12.9% with 0% introductory offer for first six months) offers a 2% cashback on purchases from more than 250 retailers in the \"Egg shopping zone\" and 1% on goods bought anywhere else. From October 11 the cashback will be reduced to 0.5% on all purchases. The Goldfish card (APR 18.9%) gives one loyalty point per \u00a31 spent. The value of these points varies from 80p to \u00a31 per \u00a3100 spent, depending on how you redeem them. The choice includes discounts on British Gas bills and services, TV licences, wine, travel and goods at a range of high street retailers. The NatWest credit card (APR 18.9%) gives one air mile for every \u00a320 spent. Air miles are no longer re deemable on the basis of one air mile per mile flown. Their value varies depending on the flights you choose. The Tesco card (APR 15.9% with introductory offer of 1.5% until July 2002) gives one Clubcard point for every \u00a32 spent on purchases anywhere and three points per \u00a32 spent on goods in Tesco stores. Points are redeemable against products in Tesco stores and filling stations or can be used to get discounts of up to 75% on travel and entertainment offers. The GM card (APR 19.9%) gives 3% of all purchases as Rebate points or 6% if the card is used to buy from a range of E-Partners plus 200 Rebate points on opening the account. These can be used to obtain up to \u00a32,500 off the price of a new Vauxhall car. Your choice of loyalty scheme will be partially dictated by personal preferences. But when it comes to choosing between cards offering similar schemes, the real value of the points on offer is what matters. A spokesperson for GM Card, which regularly publishes comparisons of the value of loyalty schemes, says: \"There are two main factors to consider - the actual monetary value of the points, so you know how much your loyalty scheme is actually giving you back, and the maximum you are likely to get out of it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
