These are just some of the insights gleaned from the Australian Common Reader, a publicly accessible database of historical library borrowing data launched this week by the Australian National University. The database tracks the borrowing habits of mostly working-class Australians between 1861 and 1928, and contains circulation records from six mechanics institute libraries, pre-dating most Australian public libraries. The project was first established by Curtin University professor Tim Dolin in 2008 before being acquired by ANU in 2013. Julieanne Lamond from ANU, who manages the project, told Guardian Australia that it was her goal to make the \u201crevolutionary\u201d database easily searchable and publicly accessible. \u201cThere\u2019s been a real difficulty getting this kind of data anywhere in the world,\u201d Lamond said. \u201cI think we\u2019re very lucky in Australia that we have so much of it and that someone had the foresight to digitise it.\u201d The libraries were based in regional areas with an intensive industry presence \u2013 coalmining, logging, wheat farming and exporting. Most of the records come from South Australia but there is also data from institutes in New South Wales, Western Australia and Victoria. Members of the public could join the libraries, despite them often being set up by companies to placate their workers. While male borrowers far outweigh women, Lamond she does not believe this is a reflection of literacy but rather the origins of the institutes themselves. \u201cThe ostensible aim for these libraries really was workers\u2019 education,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were often set up by the big employers in these towns, often mining companies, to give the workers something to do, to try and educate them and edify them. And of course the workers used them for their own purposes, and the women in the communities used them too.\u201d Miners are the most abundant profession represented in the data, making up 12.95% of borrowers, followed closely by those whose occupation was home duties \u2013 both men and women \u2013 at 10.79%. The data shows that our modern assumptions about men and women\u2019s different reading habits can\u2019t be readily applied to the past, Lamond said. \u201cThe data that we have shows that men and women read very widely across all these kinds of genres that now we think of as being quite gendered.\u201d Fiction was vastly preferred to nonfiction by all. The most voracious reader was a South Australian miner named John Pellew, who borrowed 877 books during his time with the Port Germein Institute. \u201cPeople\u2019s reading was very diverse, much more diverse than I think most of our reading is now,\u201d Lamond said. \u201cThese people just read incredibly widely. They were reading sporting novels and political thrillers, they were reading George Eliot and Jane Austen at the same time.\u201d Many of these communities had migrants from mining communities in Cornwall and Wales, places with a very strong culture around reading and self-education, Lamond said. That may explain why Cornish Christian novelist Joseph Hocking was the most popularly borrowed author, followed closely by prolific genre novelist Edward Phillips Oppenheim, and Henry Rider Haggard, who wrote adventure stories, with Charles Dickens coming in fourth. Periodicals and magazines were also circulated widely. Mrs Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch by Alice Hegan Rice was the most borrowed book by those whose occupation was listed as home duties \u2013 possibly due to the clear preference shown for it by borrower Alice Maud King, who loaned it out 20 times in 1906. The novel is a comic depiction of a family struggling with poverty. \u201cThis was a period before there were widespread public libraries in Australia,\u201d Lamond said. \u201cSo all libraries around this period were subscription libraries, and most of them were fairly expensive.\u201d Lamond hopes to acquire funding to digitise more records to give a broader insight into the reading habits of the past. \u201cWe don\u2019t have good data about metropolitan reading at the moment,\u201d Lamond said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really in existence. The stars have to align for these kinds of records to survive because often they were run by volunteer management committees, and they sat in boxes in people\u2019s attics; they threw them out; they burnt down \u2013 a lot of historical library records have gone up in smoke, literally.\u201d Most popular titles Household Words (magazine) New Monthly Magazine What Will He Do with It? by Bulwer Lytton Bentley\u2019s Miscellany (literary magazine) Tales from \u201cBlackwood\u201d (short stories) Waverley by Walter Scott Fraser\u2019s Magazine The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins Adam Bede by George Eliot Most popular authors Joseph Hocking Edward Phillips Oppenheim Henry Rider Haggard Charles Dickens Silas Kitto Hocking Ellen Wood Marie Corelli Frederick Marryat Thomas Mayne Reid Guy Newell Boothby"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
