Villa offered \u00a35m for Baros last week. That was quickly knocked back, however, with Liverpool aiming to recoup nearer twice the \u00a33.6m they paid to Banik Ostrava to sign the forward four years ago. A renewed offer is expected this week, with Baros - Liverpool's joint leading goalscorer last season with 14 - unlikely to be involved in tomorrow's Champions League game against FBK Kaunas. Liverpool, who beat Olympiakos 4-3 in Liechtenstein on Saturday, would use any money generated by Baros's sale - or that of the goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek - to add to their defensive ranks, with interest retained in Gabriel Milito and Jorge Andrade at Real Zaragoza and Deportivo La Coruna. Robbie Keane scored twice to help Tottenham Hotspur clinch the Peace Cup in Seoul with a 3-1 victory over the French champions Lyon. They took the lead in the seventh minute when Jeremy Berthod deflected a cross from Stephen Kelly into his own net. Keane added two more first-half goals, both set up by Mido. Azar Karadas scored in the 12th minute of his debut for Portsmouth as they ended their tour of France with a 2-2 draw with Monaco in Bayonne. Lomana LuaLua scored the other Pompey goal with a second-half free-kick. Joey Barton, the Manchester City midfielder sent home in disgrace from a tournament in Bangkok, has denied he punched a fan or fought his team-mate Richard Dunne. \"I was struck by a supporter, which I reacted badly to, but I stress that I didn't throw a punch,\" he told the Manchester Evening News. \"I regret the incident, but it was not the mass brawl that some people have made it out to be.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
