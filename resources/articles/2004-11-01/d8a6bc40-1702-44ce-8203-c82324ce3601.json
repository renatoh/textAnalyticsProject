The judges decided that the election of Ukip candidate John Cornforth was invalid because an unknown number of voters in Derringham ward, West Hull, received the wrong ballot paper because of an error at the printers. The ruling follows a legal challenge by former independent councillor John Considine who lost the June 10 election in Derringham by seven votes after six recounts. Mr Considine, a member of Hull council for 21 years, had argued that problems with implementing the all-postal ballot system led to some homes failing to receive voting papers while others were sent ballot papers for the Marfleet ward instead. Today, a Hull council spokeswoman said: \"In the election, an unknown number of voters in Derringham ward received the wrong ballot paper due to an error at the printers. Consequently the court has found that the election of John Cornforth is invalid as the error may have affected the result of the election and therefore a new election must be held.\" The council was pleased that the court accepted that the town hall returning officer and other council staff were not to blame for the mistake, she said. The spokeswoman added: \"The court stated: 'We should make it clear that no question of fault in fact arises. Given the tight timetable set by the legislation it may be that the returning officer and his staff did well to achieve through the printers what they did.'\" The byelection must be held within 35 working days, and could be held early in January next year. The proposed date of the election and the date for receipt of nominations for those wishing to stand for election will be announced shortly, the spokeswoman said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
