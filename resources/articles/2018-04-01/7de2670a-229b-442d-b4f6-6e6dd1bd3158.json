No one would have rolled her eyes harder than me at last night\u2019s Hellfire Farm, the opening episode in Channel 4\u2019s new docudrama series True Horror. This was the reconstructed-with-actors tale of the Sanders family, who moved to a farmhouse in the Brecon Beacons to allow Bill, artist husband of Liz, to turn an outbuilding into a studio and paint in the soft Cambrian light while children and lambs gambolled outside. Unfortunately, they found things going a bit more druidic than Sunday supplement. Blue streaks of electricity crackled round the house. Goats looked first bemused, then pained, then dead. The children didn\u2019t notice anything amiss. They thought everyone could see the silent old woman who stood motionless in the corner of the playroom all the time. Kids are so stupid. The drama is interspersed with docu from some of the people who were there. Liz herself, Becca (one of her children), journalist Mark Chadbourn and pastor Matt Tricker, who is quite as disturbing a presence as any of the spooks and spectres on offer. \u201cWales is a very mystical place,\u201d he says. \u201cWitchcraft is on the rise \u2026 people trying to contact spirits. And that\u2019s when they get into trouble, because they open doorways and spirits come through.\u201d No, I thought, they don\u2019t. And I kept thinking that as another minister reckoned that Bill\u2019s books on the occult and his increasingly tortured and frenetically created paintings were also portals to the underworld, and as their pig\u2019s madness was blamed on the spiritual infestation and the increased electricity bill was thought to be a sign of more of the same. Of course, I am not denying that electricity companies are a malign force; just that they are not anything other than a profoundly earthbound one. And that is the problem. You either believe in this sort of guff \u2013 in which case, the following hour should have had you gibbering with fear and clawing behind you for the holy water you surely keep to hand at all times \u2013 or you don\u2019t. In which case you might start gibbering with rage instead, at the waste of time and resources devoted to shoring up the credulity and preying on the gullibility of others at a time when, frankly, we have got more than enough purveyors of idiocy in the world. I suspect that even for those who do like this sort of thing, it will have fallen short. The drama, chopped into messes as it was by the interviews, couldn\u2019t build any real tension even if it had had more in its armoury than the very tamest of directorial and narrative weapons; one mildly gory scene and a few heavily telegraphed Big Boos! and that was yer basic horror-flicky lot. Any psychological terror was automatically dissipated by the fact that it depends on the protagonists\u2019 subjective experience and interpretation of events. The minute you show that secret, black and midnight hag, she ceases to be a haunting suggestion of infinite depravity and evil and becomes an extra in a wig, about whom the most frightening thing is the suggestion that she is a Lamda graduate who once dreamed of giving her Hedda Gabler at the Royal Court. There is no doubt that the Sanders family were terrified by what they truly believe to be supernatural forces, and that it was a terrible experience that eventually drove them to leave their home and to divorce. But the question that most suggested itself to a non-supernaturalist was whether any of their experience might be put down to the possible effects of mental illness on a family. Bill\u2019s \u201cpersonality change\u201d, obsessional painting and visions of bloodied bodies were blamed on malevolent spirits, but what if they were a manifestation of a disequilibrium within rather than an imbalance without? Was it possible to envisage a version of events in which his frustration at having to take on commissions rather than pursue \u201cpure\u201d art to help the family finances in the wake of those electricity bills \u2013 which, let us imagine for now, were the result of corporate incompetence rather than Cthulhu \u2013 deepened into something more serious? It wasn\u2019t a programme that asked any questions or probed to any depth, which \u2013 particularly when added to the shambolic rendering of the Sanders\u2019 genuine fear \u2013 did both the family and the viewer a great disservice. May a better spirit move through the rest of the series. Otherwise the whole thing will indeed be a true horror."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
