Lee Westwood was there, Martin Kaymer and Graeme McDowell, too, but inevitably the eyes were drawn to Phil Mickelson. In years past, the American left-hander played golf outside the United States about as often as he had candlelit dinners with Tiger Woods. He was a home bird, a stalwart of the PGA Tour. Now he is anything but; perhaps not a \"world player\" in the manner of Gary Player or Ernie Els but he is getting there. In the past three months he has teed it up in China, Singapore and, this week, in the Middle East \u2013 half a world away from his home in southern California and, perhaps more significantly, the site of this week's Bob Hope Classic on the PGA Tour. \"I want to play a lot more internationally. It has been great for me and my family to experience a lot of different cultures and learn from them,'' he said of his decision to play this week. There is also, he neglected to mention, the small matter of the appearance fee he is being paid by the tournament organisers here, rumoured to be more than $1 million. That in itself tells a story. The PGA Tour does not allow appearance fees but in golf's new frontiers, around Asia and the Middle East, such lucrative stipends have become part of the landscape. Tiger Woods, for instance, is scheduled to play in next month's Dubai Desert Classic for a reported $3 million. In two weeks' time, the Wisconsin-based US Ryder Cup player Steve Stricker will receive the first appearance fee of his career when he plays in the Qatar Masters. This is good news for Stricker's accountant and Qatari autograph hunters \u2013 the American is one of the most approachable figures in the sport \u2013 but it cannot be viewed as good news in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, home of the PGA Tour. The US Tour remains the world's richest tour and over the course of a long season it can be said to attract the best players. But for how much longer? And for how much longer can it bear to watch events like this week's Bob Hope Classic, once a premier tournament on the other side of the Atlantic, reduced to a sideshow. The field at the Hope, which is taking place in Palm Springs, has only two players from the top 40 of the world rankings. The Abu Dhabi event, meanwhile, boasts all four of last season's major championship winners, Mickelson included, along with the world No1, Westwood. From a purely golfing perspective, the next four days might offer one of the best quality tournaments of the year outside the major championships. The Englishman is trying to maintain his place at the top of the world rankings and Mickelson is out to prove he is fit again after a 2010 which began brilliantly with victory at the Masters but faded as he battled the effects of arthritis. \"We know we are not going to be as sharp as we are on day one at Augusta but we have to have our game ready this week. The only way to know where you stand is to play against the best,'' the American said. Mickelson will certainly get his wish, and on a difficult golf course made very difficult by some thick rough. It should be quite a spectacle. The rise of the Abu Dhabi event should also be recorded as a bellwether in golfing politics. In the mid-90s Greg Norman floated the idea of a world tour featuring the top 40 players in the world playing in select events but he ran into opposition from the then hugely powerful PGA Tour. The proposal, which was to be financed by the late Australian tycoon Kerry Packer, never got off the ground. Fifteen years later, Norman's vision has been partly realised, albeit without his involvement. The Australian is not in the field this week, but he will be here in spirit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
