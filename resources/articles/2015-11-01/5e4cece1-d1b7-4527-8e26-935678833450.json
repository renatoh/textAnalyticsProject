These days \u2013 on the band\u2019s first album since 1999\u2019s Loverama \u2013 David McCormack laments: \u201cWe are the parents our parents warned us about.\u201d Talk about truth in advertising. Once, Custard played dag rock; now they play dad rock. And why shouldn\u2019t they? They are dads, after all. A comeback record was always going to be a more difficult proposition for Custard than most. That\u2019s because a key part of the band\u2019s appeal was an innocence that often tripped over into a playful sense of anarchy. Their early recordings, especially, are full of the exuberance and abandon that marks one\u2019s late teens and early 20s. And anyone who\u2019s ever grown up knows how difficult that feeling is to recapture. So, yes: Come Back, All Is Forgiven is the sound of a band that\u2019s matured, at least a bit. Trying to reclaim that innocence wouldn\u2019t have been very, well, sensible. Indeed, it would have made Custard sound silly. From a fan\u2019s point of view, though, enjoying this record might depend on how much they\u2019ve grown up, too \u2013 and whether or not they still want Custard to sound silly on their behalf. To be fair, it\u2019s not as if the band achieved said maturity during their long layoff. Their drummer, Glenn Thompson, reckons this is the album they might have made had they still been together in 2001. That\u2019s probably right, but Custard were already a very different group by 2001 than they were in 1991; some of the joie de vivre essential to their DNA had already been lost. They didn\u2019t break up for nothing. Thankfully, Custard haven\u2019t lost their sense of humour or irony. On the album\u2019s key track, 1990\u2019s (the source of Come Back, All Is Forgiven\u2019s title), McCormack wallows in nostalgia for an ex-girlfriend called Catherine as a metaphor for his band\u2019s return: \u201cOK, OK, I think it\u2019s over.\u201d As pre-emptive strikes go, this is up there with Regurgitator\u2019s I Like Your Old Stuff Better Than Your New Stuff. More importantly, it\u2019s a great tune, with a lilting melody, mid-paced tempo and a lovely, hazy outro that increases the listener\u2019s sense of longing for something you can\u2019t get back. The album\u2019s opener, Orchids In Water, similarly features a lazy groove and an easy country-rock feel that recalls one of McCormack and Thompson\u2019s little-known earlier bands, COW (an acronym for Country or Western). On We Are The Parents (Our Parents Warned Us About), McCormack throws out this classic Custard line: \u201cWe can spell scientist correctly/and know all your local codes, exactly.\u201d This acknowledgment is followed by rueful acceptance: \u201cWe must have made a deal with someone up above, or down.\u201d All it needs is a reference to Enrique Iglesias for the circle back to Girls Like That to be complete. Thompson gets two songwriting credits, for Warren Rd and the much spikier (and more arresting) Contemporary Art, a kind of sequel to Music Is Crap, from the band\u2019s 1997 album We Have The Technology \u2013 one of several novelty songs that, for many fans, helped define what Custard was all about. It\u2019s also the most rock\u2019n\u2019roll song on the album, along with the hilarious 65-second thrash of If You Would Like To. It would have been funnier if Thompson had called it Contemporary Art Is Crap. But that would have sounded desperate \u2013 and Custard are not desperate to be anything other than who they are now. Come Back, All Is Forgiven sounds exactly like what it is: four guys in their mid-40s, casually knocking out a bunch of songs most bands half their age would kill for. Just don\u2019t expect to do the Wahooti Fandango to it. Come Back, All Is Forgiven is out through ABC Music"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
