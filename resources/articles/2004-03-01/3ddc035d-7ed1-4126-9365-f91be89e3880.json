What shall I wear to the wedding - 5pm on a Friday night and then to the party at the couple's home the following day. Also, what should we take for the remainder of the trip? Bonnie Dear Bonnie You lucky thing, Italian weddings are the best - best food, best clothes. As with all weddings, if you're unsure what to wear I'd think it wise to ask the rsvp contact on your invitation for general guidelines as to how formal the event will be. I would be inclined to treat a 5pm wedding as a black tie affair, whatever the country, but it's always better to check with the hosts. Don't be shy, they will be pleased that you're trying to get it right. (Obviously, make your enquiries earlier rather than later, as a phone call two nights before the wedding, when they are run off their feet, will not be welcome.) For women, the main difference with a black tie, evening wedding is that, unlike at daytime weddings, it is perfectly usual to wear a black dress. Don't wear a hat, or you'll stick out as a goofy English girl - instead, the best of both worlds is a \"fascinator\" - wonderful name - a few feathers on a hairclip, that gives the presence of a hat but looks much more evening-ish and glamorous. For the daytime party to follow, think along the lines you would do for an English daytime wedding - just lose the hat and the pashmina. As for the rest of the trip, a good sightseeing outfit is a little strappy jersey dress and a cotton cardigan. The dress is comfortable for travelling and smart enough for restaurants; with the cardigan, you are appropriately dressed for visiting churches. Have a wonderful time, Jess. \u00b7 If you have a question you would like to put to our fashion experts, email travel.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
