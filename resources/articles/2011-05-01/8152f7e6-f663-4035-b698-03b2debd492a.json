Deep-tinted violets abound but their down-turned heads blend modestly into the shade. The pink-veined petals of wood sorrel tremble in the breeze as they hang above the stream. The bright green leaves of bilberry hide their earliest, small, reddish globular floral-bells that will become a harvest of deep blue berries. Yellow celandine, tormentil, and cinquefoil gleam as the sun rests on them. The white petals of wild strawberry blooms stand out from the lovat-green mosses that thrive along the water's edge. There is regeneration in this woodland. Young rowans are springing up everywhere. Beeches too are proliferating. The first delicate pastel-green leaves on the seedlings of these mighty trees are borne on shoots that spring up through the centre of broad, dark green, disc-like cotyledons. All this is happening naturally alongside the restoration of Highland Water, one of the main streams through the forest. For many years the imperative was to get water away from the forest. Streams were straightened and anything that might impede their flow was removed. Inevitably, this made them unsuitable for creatures that had dwelt in them for millennia. Recreating the ancient, twisting flows and forming debris dams are major features of this work. So it was good to see a shoal of minnow fry taking tiny flies that settled on the pollen-rich scum of a small pool, while a pin-like black water measurer hunted along the water's edge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
