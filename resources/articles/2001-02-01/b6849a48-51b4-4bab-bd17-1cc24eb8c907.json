I am currently in Sydney with a flight on hold and having problems with my visa... That is all boring though. The reason I am writing to you is because after NZ myself and my friend are traveling to Perth to catch a flight to Johannesburg. This is all a bit nerve-racking as everyone we speak to talks of how dangerous it is in Africa and that we are mad to go there. We have had some hair raising experiences en route so far....so are not particuarly worried. I was intrigued when I read your comments to people who had recommended safaris to you. You know where this is going.. I would be hugely grateful if you could pass on any travelling tips that you receive or find out for yourself regarding Africa - places/accomodation/safaris/etc. The only contact I have there is a friend of a friend who does jungle treks in Zimbabwe. I don't know where you are now but I hope you are enjoying Oz. I am sick of it now but had some fun times although most of my time here has been a drunken blur. Need any tips for Sydney? Just ask me - I've been here eight months... Hope to hear from you soon anyway. Alison."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
