Ferguson broke off from his preparations for tonight's Champions League qualifier against Zalaegerszegi to offer Keane his total support, and refused to condemn the 31-year-old for stating he had deliberately set out to injure Alfie Haaland in a now-infamous Premiership match against Manchester City 16 months ago. A knee injury has meant Haaland has not completed a game since Keane's career-threatening lunge and he is taking professional advice about whether to sue. Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, said Keane had \"left himself open to legal action\" and \"football is not an oasis from the law of the land\". Keane's admission that his foul, which incurred a red card and was described by Haaland as \"the worst tackle I have ever received\", was a premeditated act of violence may also result in an FA charge of bringing the game into disrepute. But Ferguson responded by claiming Keane had \"told it like it was\" and should be praised for his honesty. \"I don't think there's anything wrong with it whatsoever,\" he added. \"It's something the FA will look at, I'm sure of that. But as far as I'm concerned there's nothing to worry about. I don't think there's a case to answer.\" Instead the United manager turned his anger on Haaland, accusing him of inflaming his feud with Keane by attacking him in the press. \"There has been a bit of to-ing and fro-ing between the two players for the last three of four years, particularly from Haaland's side. He has had plenty to say. But we've never complained [to the FA] when Haaland has been making comments about Roy. Every week, it seemed, or at least every time we played City there was some comment or other.\" Ferguson refused to elaborate but was referring to Haaland's sniping before the Maine Road derby in 2000, when the Norwegian midfielder accused Keane of hypocrisy, as United's highest earner, for criticising corporate fans for being \"more interested in prawn sandwiches\". The ill feeling goes back to a league match in September 1997 when Keane fouled Haaland, then of Leeds, but ruptured his own cruciate knee ligaments in the process. Over the past year, however, Haaland has tried on several occasions to defuse the situation. \"I've had a lot of calls on this,\" he said yesterday. \"But all that matters to me is getting fit.\" Ferguson said that Keane's book had been given United's full authorisation, something the manager insisted upon after Jaap Stam's autobiography was released last autumn without the club's knowledge. \"We went through everything thoroughly before it went back to the publishers. If there was a problem our lawyers would have brought it up.\" Asked about Keane's criticism of his team-mates, Ferguson added: \"He's having a go at everything, including himself. He's more open about himself than anyone; that's the great thing about him. It's a fantastic read, in terms of a man who can open himself up like that. Not many players can do that. They would prefer to fudge a lot of things, be nice for the sake of it. This is the truth; it's the way Roy sees it.\" Haaland's injured knee is not the one with which Keane connected, but the Norwegian believes the collision and fall aggravated the injury. He flew to Norway yesterday for a consultation with one of the national team's former doctors and may need further surgery. \"We will discuss the implications with Alfie, the various football authorities and our advisers before deciding on an appropriate response,\" said City's spokesman Chris Bird. Taylor revealed that the PFA had offered to broker peace talks but the invitation had been declined. \"It's left Roy in an extremely vulnerable position in terms of possible legal action,\" said Taylor. \"The last thing we need are players ending up in witness boxes but football is not above the law. \"Football should ultimately be about respect but we now have a situation where both Manchester clubs are in the Premiership and there are player vendettas going on that could and incite trouble.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
