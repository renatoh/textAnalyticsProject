To the Prof falls the thorny task of choosing a precise date to put on the death certificate for the coroner, but if he needs new evidence he could show the second leg of the Barcelona v Internazionale Champions League semi-final. Watch this 90-minute attack of overheated Jos\u00e9 Mourinho-inspired vaudeville a second time and you will see not the \"festival of football\" predicted by Bar\u00e7a's Pep Guardiola but an exercise in gamesmanship: a drip-drip of institutionalised deceit that confirmed the impotence of even the most senior Uefa match officials to extinguish diving, grappling in the penalty area and injury simulation. Beyond the brilliant one\u2011man show of Mourinho and his agitprop, Inter's aggregate victory in Catalonia on Wednesday night belonged in history's bin. To head off the predictable charge of Little Englander-ism, let it be said that our Premier League is infected with all the tricks and stunts we saw so frequently in a match that was played out 24 hours before a ball was kicked, when Mourinho set off his detonations across the city and drew Joan Laporta, the Barcelona president, into dismissing him as a \"second-rate psychologist\". First-rate, surely, with dishonours. Why the queasiness with remote control in hand? You might start with Lionel Messi (Bar\u00e7a) throwing Maicon (Inter) into an advertising hoarding at the risk of breaking his opponent's shoulder; but better to go straight to Sergio Busquets's peek-a-boo routine as he rolled around on the floor and tried to see through hands clasped to face whether Thiago Motta would be sent off for extending a hand to the poor love's jaw: an offence that would have necessitated Motta's dismissal for a second yellow card on the night, even before the Belgian referee reached for his red. Mourinho, as we all know, clapped the Busquets audition for a part in the next war film to be set on Iwo Jima, but there was no applause from him when Diego Milito and Samuel Eto'o invited the merest contact as an excuse to go to ground, when Maicon, with his wild gesticulations, pressured a linesman into giving Inter two consecutive decisions that ought to have gone Bar\u00e7a's way, or when the same full-back took a sniper's bullet when brushed by Busquets. Over on the Blaugrana side, there were Oscars for Messi after an hour when L\u00facio withdrew his leg in the penalty area but the world's best player crumpled anyway, and when Dani Alves (bottom left) , the home side's best player on the night, threw himself down in the penalty area two minutes from the end in response to Sulley Muntari's sweet attempt to hold his hand. When, for the umpteenth time, we saw one professional trying to get another booked, ITV's Jim Beglin recalled an age when players would urge referees not to caution opponents, and lamented: \"It's a very cynical profession now.\" One reading of this riotous drama was that Mourinho's provocations and Barcelona's desperation to hoist the Catalan flag over Madrid's Santiago Bernab\u00e9u stadium in three weeks' time destroyed all hope that the game would be a demonstration of the finer arts. Which is just what Mourinho intended. Led by the impervious Walter Samuel, and with 10 men for more than an hour, Inter laid on one of the great defensive masterclasses and reduced the world, European and Spanish club champions to long-range pot shots and blunt meanderings across the pitch. Thus the lights went out on the claim that Barcelona will always pass a team to death. Fifteen shots to one, 11 v 10 and 78% possession are the flowers on the grave of their wish to lord it in Madrid and prove that last year's triumph over Manchester United was the start of a gilded age. \"A team of blood, not skill,\" is how Mourinho described his Inter, who, under the Milanese Machiavelli, would never get sloshed on their own publicity, as Barcelona perhaps have. Smothering Messi in both games and then spooking Bar\u00e7a in their own cauldron entitles Mourinho to the pick of the big jobs when they come up. Assuming Inter beat Bayern Munich in the final, that is, because to lose to the underdogs in Madrid after victories over Chelsea and Barcelona would leave a stain on his work, which is distinguished so far by organisational mastery and the development of a ferocious team ethic. Professor Loland, in Fair Play in Sport \u2013 Fact or Fantasy (the conference title), should take a long look at this dude Mourinho, in this season of the Thierry Henry double-handball and countless other con-jobs, because there he will see a man planting a flag in the mountain top over the Motta sending-off while simultaneously occupying the ditch in his cultivation of the dark arts at Chelsea and now Inter. Mourinho, of course, is like the wartime monocled mutineer. He is whoever he wants to be. On Wednesday night they all joined him at his special, only\u2011to-be-used-in-an-emergency, level: low, and dirty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
