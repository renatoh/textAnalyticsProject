Which? University found several institutions have persisted in making potentially misleading statements about their positions in global league tables, in one case building a claim into Google search results. The continued use of assertions about high international status is evidence of the strain universities are under to increase their domestic and international student recruitment, as well as the effects of global rankings. Alex Hayman, the managing director of Which? University, said: \u201cIt is critical that prospective students can trust the facts that higher education institutions are putting forward. However, we\u2019ve found numerous examples of universities falling short.\u201d Which? found Newcastle University produced a \u201ckey facts\u201d document that claimed it was in the top 1% of the QS world university rankings, when it was actually 141st out of 1,000 institutions. Newcastle removed the claim after being approached by Which? \u201cDespite being informed by QS that our position puts us in the top 1% of world universities, it is not a particularly meaningful statistic and that\u2019s why we now use \u2018ranked in the top 150 by QS 2019\u2019,\u201d a spokesperson said. Aberdeen University claimed to be ranked consistently among the world\u2019s leading universities, but Which? said it did not verify this. Phil Hannaford, Aberdeen\u2019s interim senior vice-principal, said: \u201cAberdeen is highly ranked in the world, and we do not believe that the description of being a top university is misleading. \u201cThis said, we would never want anyone to believe we have misrepresented our position, so we will enhance our website, marketing and other relevant material to provide clearer qualification regards supporting information.\u201d In several cases Which? highlighted, universities exaggerated their global status by using statistical sleight of hand. Global league tables typically rank about 1,000 institutions, leaving an estimated 25,000 higher education institutions unranked. Several British universities use their league table ranking to extrapolate their position from the larger number of universities not included in the table. Among the latest examples, Ulster University claimed to be \u201cin the top 3% of universities in the world\u201d, when it was ranked as low as 600th on one league table, while the University of the West of Scotland included a claim that it \u201cranked in the top 3% of universities worldwide\u201d in its Google search descriptor. Last year, the Advertising Standards Authority issued a ruling that criticised Reading University for a misleading claim that it was in the \u201ctop 1%\u201d of worldwide universities, despite only being ranked 188th by QS. The ASA later issued a string of similar rulings on a claim by the University of West London that it was \u201cnamed as London\u2019s top modern university\u201d, and Falmouth University for an ad saying it was \u201cthe UK\u2019s No 1 arts university\u201d without sufficient evidence. The ASA\u2019s committee of advertising practice said last year: \u201cChoosing a university can be a difficult decision and a big commitment, and it is important that advertisers do not make claims which could mislead would-be students into making the wrong decision.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
