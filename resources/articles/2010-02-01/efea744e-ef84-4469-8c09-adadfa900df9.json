One was A Wizard, a True Star, his 1973 cult masterpiece made up of a side-long sequence of mostly one-minute song fragments, a soul medley, a world anthem to rival Give Peace a Chance, and a riot of prog, metal, glam and proto-punk, plus all manner of synthesizer tics, whooshes and boings. But could it be reproduced live? The 61-year-old came to London to answer that question. But first, he added humorist to his credentials by providing his own support act: Todd Rundgren's Johnson, a four-piece playing covers by bluesman Robert Johnson. It was hilariously typical of him, just as he's being hailed as a technopop pioneer by Hot Chip and Daft Punk, to ally himself to raw, ragged blues. And then the main event: A Wizard, a True Star, the apotheosis of 70s studio adventurism, made all the more exhilarating by Rundgren's eccentric costume changes. While the backing musicians, who handled the shifts of tempo magnificently, remained dressed in white suits, Rundgren switched from an astronaut outfit for International Feel, to a jumpsuit for You Need Your Head, and to a fat suit for the surreal Just Another Onionhead/Dada Dali. Dogfight Giggle was accompanied by sped-up US news footage that reminded you of the album's political subtext. It was emotional, too. The 60s R&amp;B medley had Rundgren in fabulous voice, and it was as riveting as the rest of the show was absurd, profound and moving."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
