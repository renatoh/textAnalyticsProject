Flintoff flew home from England's tour of Australia last Friday after failing to make a full recovery from a double hernia operation carried out at the end of August. The International Cricket Council said this week that although 15-man squads for the World Cup should be named by the end of the month, teams could be changed up until February 8, when the tournament starts, to take injuries into account. The 25-year-old Lancashire all-rounder was criticised by the outgoing England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Lord MacLaurin over his allegedly inappropriate approach to rehabilitation before coming home from the Ashes tour last week, leaving him with less than a month until the deadline for World Cup squad selection. MacLaurin said that Flintoff had been \"doing things in his recuperation that he probably shouldn't have\", but the ECB's new medical officer Peter Gregory, who met Flintoff and his surgeon in Manchester on Tuesday night, suggests that the problem lies elsewhere. \"Andrew has made an unexpectedly slow recovery but he has done all that has been asked in terms of rehabilitation,\" Gregory said. \"We have found no specific reason for the slowness of the recovery. Failure of repair, infection, muscle or tendon tears and joint problems have all been excluded as the cause of injury. At this stage he remains weak in important muscles and is continuing to experience pain after short spells of fast bowling. \"He will require more intensive one-to-one rehabilitation to begin immediately under the day-to-day supervision of the Lancashire medical team, geared to Freddie being able to prove himself properly match fit by mid-January.\" That would leave Flintoff a further three or four weeks before England's first game, against Zimbabwe in Harare on February 13. Neil Fairbrother, Flintoff's former Lancashire team-mate who is now working with his agent Andrew Chandler, said: \"The extension of the deadline has perhaps given Fred a bit more time, and hopefully by mid-January he'll be ready to go. Peter Gregory was happy with the amount of work that he's done and they've come up with a plan of action for the next two or three weeks. As he says, unfortunately it's not an exact science, but they have identified a weakness in certain areas and they are looking to rectify that.\" Flintoff's all-round ability had established him as a regular member of England's one-day team well before he graduated to the Test side last winter, and despite the frustrations of Duncan Fletcher and Nasser Hussain during his slow recovery he seems likely to be included in the World Cup squad. \u00b7 Australia have delayed announcing their side for the fourth Test at the MCG beginning on Boxing Day. Because of Shane Warne's damaged shoulder, selection has been put back to Sunday. Western Australia's left-arm wrist spinner Brad Hogg will deputise for Warne against Sri Lanka this weekend, but he faces competition from the leg-spinner Stuart MacGill for a place in the Test side. \u00b7 Bangladesh's search for a Test win continues after they slipped to a seven-wicket defeat in the second Test against West Indies in Chittagong. The victory completed a 2-0 series whitewash and means Bangladesh have lost 16 of 17 matches since their introduction to the Test arena, the other match finishing in a draw. West Indies, chasing 111 for victory, won with two days to spare after Chris Gayle contributed a quick-fire 37."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
