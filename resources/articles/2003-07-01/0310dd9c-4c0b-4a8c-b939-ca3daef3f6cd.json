Everyone wore suits, all the men wore ties and a number of the women movie critics (who were in the majority then because Fleet Street editors didn't consider overnight drama criticism a fitting job for a lady) wore hats. When Alex died last week, he was the oldest practising movie critic and the only one left who wore a suit and tie. He never carried a shoulder bag or briefcase, though he'd occasionally sport a carrier from Fortnum's or Hatchards. I first met him nearly 40 years ago when I reviewed his book, The Celluloid Sacrifice, subtitled 'Aspects of Sex in the Movies'. It was the first of 20 books, some scholarly, all well researched, none of them pot-boiling ephemera, and showed his insight into the nature of stardom, his grasp of movies as a business and his ability to see the cinema in a larger cultural context. He called me after the review, inviting me to lunch. I made a faulty diary entry and didn't turn up. We arranged a second lunch and I went to the wrong Italian restaurant. Patiently, he wrote suggesting another date, adding that our meeting had 'now become more of a challenge than a pleasure'. Such was the rocky beginning of a relationship as friends and colleagues that lasted four decades. For 25 of those years I was a producer for BBC radio and he worked for me as a fluent, highly professional broadcaster. I recall his confident first appearance on the old Home Service programme, The Critics, in 1967 when, during a discussion of a young sculptor's work, he described a piece as 'pristine' and was immediately challenged by George Melly to explain the term. 'Pure, untarnished by experience,' Alex replied without pause. As friends, we were opposites - me the woolly, diffident liberal, he an Ulster Unionist of firm right-wing views and absolute conviction, some of his opinions verging on the Larkinesque. Yet he was also deeply divided. I've always thought of him as a curious cross between those Irish ex-friends, Oscar Wilde and Sir Edward Carson. Like Wilde, he was something of a dandy, a performer (he'd been a child actor on BBC radio), a lover of the high life, of dining out, a skilled raconteur, a strainer after epigrams. Like Carson, he was a relentless interrogator with formidable forensic skills, pinning his opponents down, arguing for victory. Seeing him jump up at Cannes press conferences, usually such anodyne occasions, to put questions to a hapless filmmaker who had made a naive picture on the Troubles was like watching a gifted advocate engage in cross-examination. Alex was a man of fantastic energy, whether accumulating an impressive art collection (based entirely on his own taste and knowledge) or indulging in controversy. He enlivened and often inflamed the film committees on which he sat (he was elected a member governor of the British Film Institute) and was involved in a whole raft of causes. He went to law over copyright infringements of his books, made a number of Atlantic crossings to challenge a Toronto journalist before the Canadian Press Council, and wrote several letters a day to the press or the heads of institutions. His lifelong anti-smoking campaign once resulted in a fight with a smoker in the foyer of the Curzon, Mayfair. Every week he'd gleefully bring me up to date on his litigation and his battles. For Alex, there was no gap between indignation and action. He was probably the only person who, after a matin\u00e9e of Hair, went backstage to complain to the management that the cast had not, as promised, divested themselves of their clothes. When my wife was edged into a pothole and broke her wrist while cycling in Sweden, his immediate reaction, after expressing his sympathy, was to say: 'You realise that you've got to sue the local authority?' Only a few weeks ago, he compelled the BBC into paying him and me a sum of money over which they'd been prevaricating. Last month, a security man at the 20th Century-Fox offices interrupted us as we talked on the staircase to tell us that critics had no right to use the upstairs lavatory. I'd forgotten the incident within an hour, but Alex took to his typewriter and an exchange of letters ensued with the head of Fox. Though Alex had many friends, there seemed to be no one close enough to restrain him from folly. But his wildness was part of his character, the mixture of generosity and vindictiveness, of dogma and rebellious freethinking was what made him unpredictable. One minute, he'd be railing against censorship, the next demanding that David Cronenberg's Crash be banned. 'What does Alex want?' James Ferman, then secretary of the BBFC, once asked me plaintively. Very crudely put, he wanted to stir things up and he managed it on a weekly basis. Of David Fincher's Fight Club (1999) he said: 'It is an inadmissible assault on personal decency... this film is anti-capitalist, anti-society, and indeed, anti-God.' Fincher cherished the review and discussed it on the DVD. The weekly press screenings won't be the same without his dapper presence, and he'll be missed by members of the Critics' Circle, an association from which, incidentally, he resigned more than 30 years ago for reasons lost in antiquity. Plaudits and putdowns: Walker's words on... Dirty Pretty Things 'To its credit and our film industry's shame, [it] is almost the only British-made movie this year that tells us how our nation is changing.' AI 'It's not only the most richly allusive film this year so far it's also the summation of one great director's genius by means of the proxy skills of another great filmmaker's imagination.' Pandaemonium 'I don't know why the new Film Council wants to stick its name on the screen and claim any part in Julien Temple's Pandaemonium. The council wasn't even in existence in 1999 when the Arts Council handed out \u00a3656,094 of public money from the National Lottery to help Temple make a film that's among the most vulgar travesties of English literature I've seen in years - certainly since Ken Russell gave up the ghost.' Shakespeare in Love 'It is such a clever film: literate, sensual, accessible, light-hearted, even giddy-headed. I may have gone in as a sceptic; I don't mind confessing I came out a sycophant.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
