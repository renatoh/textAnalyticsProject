A rejigged lineup and White Stripes producer Joe Chiccarelli have made for a far more robust sound, which channels old school DIY post-punk (Kleenex, the Slits), and vintage riot grrrl via Pixies-style bittersweetness and big angular riffs. The tunes provide vehicles for Creevy to have her say on subjects from empowerment to tweet shaming. Told You I\u2019d Be With the Guys is a cry for female solidarity packed into an aural fizz bomb. Early adulthood seems to fire the more brooding Nuclear Bomb. Not all the songs fire quite as convincingly, but the band sound as if they\u2019re coming of age and still having fun growing up disgracefully. In Trash People, Creevy confesses: \u201cI wear my underpants three days in a row, my room smells like an ashtray.\u201d Ugh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
