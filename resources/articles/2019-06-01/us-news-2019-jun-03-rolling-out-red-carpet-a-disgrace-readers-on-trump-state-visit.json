Surely an unprecedented and boorish move in the history of diplomacy? Jeremy Hunt\u2019s spineless deflection of this insult reveals how far the UK has fallen \u2013 how far, indeed, the Tories are willing to go on putting up with this humiliating farce. That the US is demanding the NHS be on the table in a post-Brexit trade deal is the most damning verdict yet on this decade of Tory misrule. The fact Trump has brought along his family, who, by all accounts, seem to consider meeting the inordinately dull Windsors to be the highlight of this visit, tells us everything about the tackiness of his brood. Not least, their shameless fantasy of becoming the reigning dynasty of an American monarchy. Macademiac \u2018That the British state has rolled out the red carpet for Trump in this way is a total disgrace\u2019 That the British state has rolled out the red carpet for Trump in this way is a total disgrace. Worse, it is politically and strategically inept. If the UK were a party, people would be tearing up their membership cards in disgust and dismay at how it has lost its way. Thank goodness it isn\u2019t, and the people of Britain have a reason to stay and turn back the tide. DavidLoveday \u2018By what possible measure is Trump \u201cthe leader of the free world\u201d\u2019?\u2019 By what possible measure is Trump \u201cthe leader of the free world\u201d as described by Hunt? That\u2019s a description that should not be automatically applied, when the facts don\u2019t warrant it. Trump is not leading the free world, the free world is ignoring him on so many levels, from global warming, to trade, to diplomatic policy. Bart1785 \u2018It is outrageous that so many public figures in Britain are allowing this vile creep into England\u2019 To expand on what another person has said here, thank you Mayor Sadiq Khan for saying publicly what most private citizens think about the dreadful and repulsive Trump. It is outrageous that so many public figures in Britain are allowing this vile creep into England to insult all and sundry. More strength to your arm and your speech, Mr Kahn. Kohanga16 \u2018Trump being invited to attend D-day commemorations is an insult to all who fought\u2019 I\u2019ve never been so ashamed to be British. That we are rolling out the red carpet for this vile individual makes me want to vomit. That a draft dodger who thinks Neo Nazis are \u201cvery fine people\u201d is invited to attend D-day commemorations is an insult to all who fought. The fact that he is president does not entitle him to a state visit. Watching the Tories kowtowing and licking their lips that they\u2019ll now be able to sell off the NHS to him is the lowest that party has ever fallen \u2013 and that\u2019s saying something. dizzyweg \u2018It\u2019s totally appropriate for Labour to boycott\u2019 Hunt also said, \u201cI agree with him that it is totally inappropriate for the Labour party to be boycotting this incredibly important visit. This is the president of the United States.\u201d Personally, I think it\u2019s totally appropriate. Being president doesn\u2019t entitle him to a state visit, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be able to count the number of them who\u2019ve had one on one hand. The invitation was ludicrous in the first place and Trump\u2019s shown himself to be undeserving of any respect regardless of the title he has. If anything, he\u2019s devalued the presidency to the point where it\u2019ll be hard to take the next office holder seriously. UniversallyCynic \u2018This man is an anomaly, he is not the America I know\u2019 Remember previous visits, some state occasions, some business, by US presidents? All, at the time, probably the most powerful men in the world. All courteous, wearing that strength and power with dignity, respect and a sense of responsibility. Over the years I have agreed with some, such as Obama, and disagreed with some, such as GW Bush. But I have never been contemptuous of an American president until Donald Trump. He lands slinging insults and taking partisan positions in local affairs, he doesn\u2019t give a damn about anything. He brings his whole family for an electioneering photoshoot. I love America, I have worked there and I have travelled widely on both coasts and in the middle. This man is an anomaly, he is not the America I know. He is a disgrace and he must soon be over with. AlanP10 \u2018We need to keep him onside, even if his policies are often wrong, or awful\u2019 While Trump remains a \u2018divisive\u2019 (ahem...) figure, he does represent NATO, which is our most important military alliance. An alliance in which the democracies, particularly Western democracies, rely upon to defend ourselves from those who oppose democracy. It is vital particularly at the time of the D-day commemorations to remind Trump that the cost of undermining NATO could rebound on the US as well as Europe. The death of so many shows that we must not risk our hard won peace by alienating Trump who in turn could undermine NATO. We may have to hold our noses when Trump visits, but he does represent the most powerful and important defensive alliance in the world. We need to keep him onside; even if his policies are often myopically short-sighted, blinkered, wrong, or awful. RPDolan"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
