By mid-afternoon on Sunday, when morale is low, songs you know as intimately as your parents\u2019 phone number, played by icons who are very often older than your parents, offer a particularly welcome kind of comfort. But with Kylie, it\u2019s different. She was supposed to play Glastonbury in 2005, she reminds us, back when she was a regular icon, perhaps not yet a living legend. But then, she says, \u201ccircumstances\u201d struck: she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to watch from her bed in Australia, moved by the sight of some bands covering her songs in tribute. She cries as she tells this story, but doesn\u2019t mention cancer explicitly \u2013 an omission that reflects how incongruous this dark moment was in her world. Kylie was about lightness, about transcending time\u2019s limitations. Stock Aitken Waterman pop stars weren\u2019t built to last, let alone evolve beautifully through decades\u2019 worth of shifts in the fabric of pop and experience second, third, fourth heydays. That this was under threat in 2005 didn\u2019t compute, to the degree that it felt like a national crisis in her adoptive home land. Thank god, she survived, and made it to Glastonbury 14 years after her initial appointment and to a hero\u2019s welcome. One of the artists who covered her at the festival in 2005 was Coldplay, and she brings Chris Martin on to perform with her. Worryingly, he\u2019s carrying an acoustic guitar, another thing that frankly has no place in Kylie\u2019s gloriously ritzy world. They proceed to perform Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head \u2013 one of the 21st century\u2019s most futuristic pop songs \u2013 in a stripped-back style. While tantamount to forsaking her official gay icon status, the goodwill and charm of the moment carries them through. Fortunately, the rest of the set is solid gold unadulterated Kylie: that peerless mix of total sincerity and fierce camp that she\u2019s been serving up for more than 30 years. Dancers in pastel trousers waggle 7ft-tall letters spelling out her name during I Should Be So Lucky, then she brings out a man dressed as Klaus Nomi, the German-via-New York performance artist who died of aids in 1983, and they dance tenderly on Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi and Hand on Your Heart. It\u2019s all as silly \u2013 she adds a Chic-style \u201cChoo-choo, beep beep\u201d breakdown to The Locomotion \u2013 as it is sexy. During Slow, revamped as a bassy, throbbing club track fit for the festival\u2019s queer haven NYC Downlow, she interpolates the lascivious riff from Bowie\u2019s Fashion and grinds against the microphone in a manner that raises the already significant temperature. Nick Cave comes on for Where the Wild Roses Grow, and they share a similarly potent, intimate embrace. The showmanship, the incredible run of hits \u2013 it is absolutely phenomenal. So much so that the crowd keep bursting into chants of \u201cKylie! Kylie!\u201d and bringing her to tears. Never mind the legends slot; next stop, headliner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
