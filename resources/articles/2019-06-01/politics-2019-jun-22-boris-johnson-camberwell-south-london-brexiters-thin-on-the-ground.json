They\u2019re too busy dealing with drugs and knife crimes.\u201d Johnson moved into Symonds\u2019s flat in a converted Georgian house in Brunswick Park, after separating from his wife Marina Wheeler last autumn. Neighbours say he was once seen buying wine in a local shop, but otherwise keeps a low profile \u2013 emerging from the flat only to duck into a car parked outside. He is wise to do so. Camberwell, with its arts college and large ethnic community, is overwhelmingly opposed to Brexit. Posters on the railings of a small park opposite Symonds\u2019s flat yesterday showed Johnson\u2019s face beneath the words: \u201cWe\u2019d rather endure him as our neighbour than our prime minister.\u201d Homes on nearby Camberwell New Road \u2013 the A202, which connects London to Dover \u2013 are festooned with EU flags. \u201cI hate Johnson,\u201d Miriam Rogers, 28, a city planner and local resident, said on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019ve just come back from two weeks\u2019 holiday and can\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to be our prime minister.\u201d Another neighbour, who declined to be named, said: \u201cHe\u2019s in enemy territory here and needs to move.\u201d A third declared: \u201cEveryone here thinks he\u2019s a total wanker.\u201d But his presence could have one upside. Save for three months that Johnson spent as a trainee reporter in Wolverhampton, it may be the only time in his gilded life that he has lived as the people he aspires to govern do. Brunswick Park has been gentrified over the past decade, but it is ringed by postwar housing estates that are home to feuding gangs. In 2000, 10-year-old Damilola Taylor was stabbed to death half a mile away, and the violence has scarcely let up. \u201cKnifings and shootings are more than commonplace,\u201d said Webb. Despite that the local police station, which had a dozen officers 10 years ago, closed in March. \u201cAt least Johnson may glimpse the real world before he disappears into Downing Street,\u201d Webb added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
