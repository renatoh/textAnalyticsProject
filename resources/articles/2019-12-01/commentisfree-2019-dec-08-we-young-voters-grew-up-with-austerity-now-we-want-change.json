At least Labour offers change", "bodyText": "My generation\u2019s coming of age has coincided with coalition and Conservative governments. Austerity, which has shaped our formative years (I\u2019m now 22), was framed as a fiscal necessity. But the severe cuts to government spending made an impact on healthcare, youth services, education and many other public services. These aren\u2019t just abstract spending cuts \u2013 they are viscerally felt on the ground. In Camden, the London borough where I attended school, the council\u2019s budget has been reduced by \u00a3169m since 2010. It was highly noticeable while growing up. But austerity wasn\u2019t a blanket policy that affected everyone equally. Research has shown that the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, more a notion than a set of policies, has been severely undermined by austerity. Also, low-income women from black and Asian backgrounds are disproportionately bearing the brunt of austerity. The recent frenzy among friends my age to open help-to-buy ISAs before the deadline does not eliminate the barriers we face to home ownership; 70% of young people believe owning a home is near impossible. This election comes at a pivotal time and offers a chance to alter this trajectory. With engagement among young people increasing, a politics that addresses our material circumstances couldn\u2019t be more pressing. The sense of dissonance between the priorities of the Conservative leadership and younger generations is glaring, both in terms of policy positions and values. The Tory manifesto mentions the climate crisis only 10 times, compared with 60 times for Brexit. The Windrush scandal, and the continuing fight for justice, serves as a reminder of how Conservative immigration policies have cultivated an atmosphere of fear among immigrant communities. The hardline immigration policies of the home secretary, Priti Patel, coupled with Boris Johnson\u2019s assertion that he is in favour of having \u201cpeople of talent\u201d come into this country as long as it is \u201cdemocratically controlled\u201d reinforces the dichotomy of the \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d immigrant. The material effects of coalition policies, combined with a worldview that doesn\u2019t fit with ideas of tolerance and inclusivity, have resulted in an urgency for change. The idea of a cult of personality surrounding Corbyn may have made sense during the 2017 election coverage, but there now appears to be a shift among young people. Labour\u2019s inability to comprehensively address its problems with structural racism, especially antisemitism, is damning. And this has not been ignored by young Labour campaigners. Among young party volunteers campaigning in Putney, south-west London, one, despite being a member of Momentum, mentioned that there was a \u201ctacit agreement not to mention Corbyn on the doorstep\u201d. If we\u2019re still on board with Labour, it\u2019s because of innovative and transformative ideas that have brought vibrancy and intellectual curiosity to a young electorate. Labour\u2019s commitment to a green industrial revolution makes concrete steps to address the climate crisis. Labour\u2019s current position on immigration reflects the values that many young people like me share \u2013 that freedom of movement isn\u2019t a necessary evil, as it was portrayed during the Brexit referendum, but, rather, a part of a tolerant and inclusive society. Although the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that the Labour manifesto is failing to offer a \u201cproperly credible prospectus\u201d, what is deemed properly credible doesn\u2019t convince when we are faced with the continuation of the status quo. Young people are driven by a need to change the policies and values espoused by the government, a tangible change that will address the material inequalities between generations, as well as a moral shift. Pledges such as free hospital parking for a select few workers and in-patients won\u2019t begin to shift the deep-rooted inequities. Johnson\u2019s use of vulgar andoffensive language, including referring to Muslim women as \u201cletterboxes\u201d and the children of working mothers as \u201cunloved and undisciplined\u201d, fails to represent the moral values we want our society to embody. But longing for a deep political change should not be equated with an unequivocal and blind endorsement of Corbyn. Instead, it\u2019s about the ideas behind a compelling alternative we\u2019ve been offered, in contrast to a society we feel we haven\u2019t always had a stake in.
