The five supreme court judges based their unanimous and historic judgment on Hindus\u2019 claim that the site is the birthplace of the god Ram. They ruled that a mosque that had stood on the site since the 16th century, and was the basis of the Muslim claim to Ayodhya, was \u201cnot built on vacant land\u201d and that the Hindu belief could not be disputed. The judges declared that a separate \u201cprominent\u201d five-acre piece of land would be allocated to the Muslim community to build a mosque near the contested site. The ruling, just six months after his landslide election win, is another huge victory for India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government, which have made the restoration of the Ram temple at Ayodhya a focal point of their Hindu nationalist agenda. The supreme court judges said plans for the temple would be drawn up within the next three months. \u201cIt is a historic judgment,\u201d said Varun Kumar Sinha, a lawyer for Hindu Mahasabha, a rightwing party that advocated for the rebuilding of the Ram temple at Ayodhya. \u201cWith this judgment, the supreme court has given the message of unity in diversity.\u201d The head of the Hindu nationalist RSS organisation, Mohan Bhagwat, echoed Sinha\u2019s comments and said his group welcomed the decision. \u201cThis case was going on for decades and it reached the right conclusion,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should not be seen as a win or a loss.\u201d Zafaryab Jilani, the lawyer for the Muslim claimants, the Sunni Waqf Board, challenged the decision and said the board would meet later to decide whether to file an appeal. \u201cWe respect the supreme court, we respect the judgment, but we are not satisfied with this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of contradictions within the judgment. Five acres has no value.\u201d Conflict over Ayodhya has been raging between India\u2019s Muslims and Hindus for more than 150 years. Muslims say it is a historical place of worship, but Hindus say the mosque, built by the Mughal emperor Babur, was on the site of an older temple honouring Ram\u2019s birthplace. The country was put on high security alert following the verdict for fear of religious violence and rioting. Thousands of police and paramilitary troops were dispatched to the state of Uttar Pradesh and around 500 people arrested in the days before. Protests and parties were also banned in Ayodhya. The supreme court judges said their ruling was conditional on the \u201cmaintenance of peace and order and tranquility\u201d. The city was quiet in the immediate aftermath of the verdict. All non-residents were obliged to leave the city on Friday night and no one was allowed to leave their house without their identity card. A few firecrackers were set off, but the heavy police presence kept celebrations and protests muted. Rajatram Maurya, a tailor in the city who used to grow flowers on the temple land before it was claimed by the government, had mixed feelings to the ruling. \u201cThe verdict is good for all, but I lost my land in this and the compensation I got from the government was barely anything \u2026 But I am glad there is peace in Ayodhya.\u201d Modi said on Twitter that the judgement \u201chighlights that any dispute can be amicably solved in the spirit of due process of law. It reaffirms the independence, transparency and farsightedness of our judiciary. It clearly illustrates everybody is equal before the law.\u201d BJP members led a march to Ayodhya in December 1992, during which hundreds of thousands of people descended onto the Babri mosque and reduced it to rubble with hammers and axes. More than 2,000 people were killed in the rioting and violence that ensued, and some BJP members are still facing trial for their role in the violence. This destruction of the mosque has been cited as a pivotal moment in the failure of secularism and religious inclusivity in India, fracturing the country down religious lines that have been politically exploited ever since. The sensitive decision over whether to rebuild a place of Muslim or Hindu worship on the site was dragged out over 27 years. A 2010 court ruling divided the land between Muslims and Hindus, but was rejected by both sides. The case was taken to the supreme court in August. Since Modi and the BJP took power in 2014, the rebuilding of a Ram temple at Ayodhya has been at the forefront of their Hindutva agenda, which has pushed India away from its secular roots and toward a strongly Hindu identity. This has led to growing hostility and violence toward the country\u2019s Muslims, who number 200 million. Muslim history has been removed from school textbooks and there has been an increase in reports of vigilante Hindu mobs murdering Muslims suspected of killing cows, which are sacred in Hinduism. In June, a Hindu mob tied a Muslim man to a lamp and lynched him to cries of \u201chail Lord Ram\u201d. The Modi government\u2019s actions in Kashmir in August, stripping the state of its long-held semi-autonomy, was also seen as directly targeting its majority-Muslim community."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
