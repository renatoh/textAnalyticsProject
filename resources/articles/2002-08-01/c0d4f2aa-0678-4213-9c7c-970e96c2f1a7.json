Rarely does patience earn more than a minor mention. But last night this emerging Newcastle United side displayed patience in an even greater amount than passion and, if they can reproduce it, it will be this quality that could see them emulate or surpass last season's achievement of finishing fourth. Many more sides will come to St James' Park and defend in the same numbers West Ham did, but now Newcastle have shown they have the intelligence to wait and push and then wait some more. This makes Sir Bobby Robson's team a much more serious prospect than in either of his previous two seasons. It is too early to be considering title challengers of course, though Robson revealed the true nature of Newcastle's attitude when he said afterwards: \"We knew the others in the top six from last season had won and so we knew that if we lost we'd be three points behind already. We've kept in touch. \"We didn't panic at half-time. I just said: 'We'll win it.' There wasn't anything to worry about. It was just a question of using the 90 minutes to win the match.\" Robson's half-time assessment was correct. It took more than an hour of diligent Newcastle probing before West Ham finally succumbed and it was far from inevitable as the twin banks of the Londoners' midfield and defence stood resolute. But rather than lose their way and concentration in the face of such frustration, Newcastle, continually urged on by the central partnership of Jermaine Jenas and Kieron Dyer, continued to play thoughtful football. It is not what they have come to expect at St James' Park and at times the home crowd, so vociferous at kick-off, fell silent. Yet, with Nolberto Solano on the right and the new \u00a38.5m teenager Hugo Viana on the left, the Newcastle midfield consistently sought to work the ball, not simply resort to hitting it long to Alan Shearer. How Glenn Roeder would have liked to have had Shearer on his team. Shearer's physical presence and ability to retain possession under pressure were what West ham lacked. Already without Paolo Di Canio, the Hammers lost Freddie Kanout\u00e9 yesterday morning with a stiff neck. Consequently their forward line was a diminutive one. It consisted of Jermaine Defoe and Joe Cole and for the first half they were a creative force as West Ham looked to attack on the break. This was quite often and Cole produced the most dangerous moment of the first half, a spin past Nikos Dabizas and Olivier Bernard and then a diagonal drive that had Shay Given scurrying across his goal-line. Given had earlier made a sharp stop from Trevor Sinclair whereas Newcastle, for all their possession, had not forced David James into anything of comparative significance. That changed after the interval. Continuing to play deliberately, willing to go backwards if it meant then coming forwards soon after, the home side began to fashion chances. Titus Bramble rose to meet a Viana corner, James tipping the ball over; Jenas then had a shot and in the 63rd minute Lomano Lua Lua scored the goal that all too quickly curtailed West Ham's resistance. Solano floated in another corner, Jenas flicked it on and Lua Lua, not known locally for his composure in front of goal, steered the ball low through the legs of James. Ten minutes later it was two and in a further 13 minutes it was four. \"The wheels came off,\" said a dejected Roeder, who also saw S\u00e9bastien Schemmel storm down the tunnel gesturing angrily after being substituted. Viana has had a continent's worth of praise for his gifted left foot and he showed why when delivering the perfect cross for Newcastle and Lua Lua's second. Lua Lua, who grew up in Leyton a Hammers fan, powered a header toward James. The new West Ham captain parried the ball on to the crossbar but it then bounced down and in. The Londoners steadily lost their earlier discipline and Solano provided the next goal, slipping to the byline and supplying the perfect cutback for Shearer. He doesn't miss from there. Four minutes from time Shearer repaid the Peruvian, crossing low from the opposite flank to the far post, where Solano nipped in to slide the ball home. \"We are top of the league,\" St James' Park chanted on the whistle. And statistically they were right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
