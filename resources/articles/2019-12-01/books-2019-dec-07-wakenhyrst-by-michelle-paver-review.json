Wakenhyrst fits into her oeuvre perfectly, with its atmospheric tale of Maud Stearne, the reclusive occupant of Wake\u2019s End, a dilapidated house in the Fens. Going back to Maud\u2019s childhood at the turn of the last century, Paver weaves an enjoyably creepy plot concerning dark goings-on in the marshes. What\u2019s particularly engaging is the way she shows us, from a child\u2019s point of view, how the adults use both religion and superstition as a means to control others and to limit knowledge that might empower those they hold down. Yet it is Maud\u2019s father\u2019s disdain for women that causes him to dangerously underestimate his beleaguered daughter\u2019s agency. He is gradually, and very satisfyingly, shown to be his own worst enemy. Deceptively breezy storytelling combines with increasingly dark themes to great effect. \u2022 Wakenhyrst is published by Head of Zeus (RRP \u00a38.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.
