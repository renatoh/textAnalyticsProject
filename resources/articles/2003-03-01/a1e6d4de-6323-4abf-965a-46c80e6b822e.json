Bolton were rewarded for their greater attacking enterprise and better chances when Spurs defender Gary Docherty brought down French midfielder Youri Djorkaeff and the Nigerian steered the ball past Kasey Keller from the spot. Bolton climbed two points above West Ham United, who now occupy the third relegation spot with seven games to pay.
