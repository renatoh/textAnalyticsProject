The 1974 film, made for just $140,000, beat films such as The Shining, Dawn of the Dead and Hitchcock's Psycho in a poll by Total Film magazine. Halloween came second, Suspiria third. The magazine said: \"The only thing more terrifying than the opening 50 minutes of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the last 30.\" Six of the top 10 were made in the 1970s. Films such as The Exorcist and The Blair Witch Project failed to make the top 10."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
