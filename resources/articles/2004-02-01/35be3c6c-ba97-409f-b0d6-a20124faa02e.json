The prime minister hinted at other radical proposals which could feature in plans to target the country's most serious criminals. The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) is expected to have more than 5,000 investigators concentrating on crimes such as drug trafficking, people smuggling and fraud. During a visit to the national hi-tech crime unit in London's Docklands, Mr Blair said the new agency must be prepared to be \"ruthless\" to break down the complex networks established by international criminals, and he hinted that the burden of proof in organised crime cases may need to be lowered so that it is easier for police to secure convictions. \"My impression sometimes is that the system is struggling against a presumption that you treat these crimes like every other type of crime and that you build up cases beyond reasonable doubt. I think we have got to look at this,\" he said. \"To require everything beyond reasonable doubt in these cases is very difficult. I think people would accept that within certain categories of case, provided it's big enough, you don't take the normal burden.\" Mr Blair also expressed openness towards the use of evidence gained by telephone intercepts. After speaking with police officer Helene Gould, who described how she had won permission from a court to use telephone intercept, he said: \"Surely we should be able to use this stuff if we want to.\" The creation of the SOCA will be the biggest shake-up of the way British policing is organised since the current boundaries of the 43 forces in England and Wales were set out 40 years ago. Dubbed the British FBI, it brings together staff at four existing agencies - the National Crime Squad (NCS), the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) and the investigative arms of Customs and Excise and the immigration service. \"Crime organisations work as one cohesive unit and we have got to do the same,\" said Mr Blair. \"We can't treat this like other categories of crime. We need to have one focal point instead of different agencies that will come together for certain operations but aren't working in the co-ordinated way that we want.\" The home secretary, David Blunkett, gave his own rationale for the creation of the SOCA at a launch earlier today. \"Organised criminals make their millions from human misery - trafficking in drugs and people, engaging in fraud and extortion. They control criminal empires that reach from the other side of the world to the dealer on the street corner,\" he said. \"They believe they are beyond the reach of justice and out of our sights. That is not the case. No one should be untraceable and no one should be untouchable. This new agency will focus on tracking them down.\" Mr Blunkett said a panel will now be set up to appoint a chairman and director-general for the agency. A comprehensive new strategy with tough new laws to target organised crime will also be announced in the near future. Roy Ramm, former head of the Organised Crime Unit, welcomed the move. \"There are issues of overlap and sometimes turf wars. Bringing these agencies together will make an enormous difference and is long overdue,\" he told BBC breakfast television. Chris Fox, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers echoed Mr Ramm's opinion. \"Combining the expertise, resources and experience of all those working in the crime-fighting agencies will help us build on the work currently under way to deal with very significant crimes often involving hardcore drugs, illegal immigration and gun crime,\" he said. \"We note the opportunity to enhance border security and welcome any changes in protocol that will make this more of a reality.\" The new force is expected to feature not just police officers but a range of specialist civilian investigators such as accountants, financial analysts and computer experts. It was unclear how much involvement the spy agencies MI5 and GCHQ would have in the new agency. The establishment of a national force is seen in part as a response to criticism of Customs and Excise over a number of botched trials involving drug traffickers and fraudsters. Customs and Excise boasts a \u00a31bn annual budget and has 1,850 officers in several different arms addressing fraud, drug trafficking and other cross-border crime. NCIS, which prepares intelligence on organised crime and shares its findings with the 43 regional forces of England and Wales, currently has 1,200 staff and an annual budget of \u00a393m NCS has 1,330 detectives, 420 support staff and an annual budget of \u00a3130m. It carries out its own investigations on serious organised crime, spending three quarters of its resources targeting drug traffickers. There were unconfirmed reports at the weekend that former New York police chief Bill Bratton could be named as head of the new organisation. Mr Blunkett is an admirer of Mr Bratton's zero tolerance tactics that saw crime in New York City fall by more than a third during his tenure. Last year the home secretary announced plans that would allow foreigners to become chief constables for the first time. He has already put ex-Boston police chief Paul Evans at the helm of the Home Office's Police Standards Unit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
