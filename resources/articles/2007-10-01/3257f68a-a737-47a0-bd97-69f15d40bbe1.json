And it proved a tough encounter for the home side at the Halliwell Jones Stadium. The tourists led 15-5 after a first half in which they capitalised on the errors of the home side. But Smith's half-time talk seemed to have galvanised the Northern Union who within 12 minutes of the re-start had drawn level. They took the lead soon after with a try, worth three points last night with the match being played under the original scoring rules, from Hull centre Kirk Yeaman, but the All Golds replied with a touchdown from Louis Anderson and Clinton Toopi sealed a 25-18 victory with a late score with scrum-half Stacey Jones, in his last ever game of rugby league, rounding things off with two conversions. The match gave Smith a perfect opportunity to have a look at some of the players who will be pushing for inclusion in the first Test at Huddersfield on Saturday. The former Leeds coach also took the opportunity to run an eye over some of the Kiwis his side will be facing, given that half the All Golds team will be staying on for the Test series. This is very much a new era for Great Britain, with Smith having taken over from Brian Noble. Noble was coach for four years, albeit on a part-time basis. The Australian Smith, however, is a full-time appointment and his remit extends beyond merely looking after the national team. He is charged with putting in place a structure to facilitate the development of young players who capable of playing at the highest level. Smith showed his credentials at Leeds, signing off by winning last week's Grand Final with a team that included a healthy sprinkling of locally produced youngsters. The Rhinos have shown flair in attack, but were capable of steely defence and if Smith can replicate that with Britain then they will be able to challenge the southern hemisphere domination of the sport. New Zealand suffered a 58-0 thrashing at the hands of Australia last week, although they had to play most of the game with 12 men. They will be without NRL stars Sonny Bill Williams and Benji Marshall plus Leeds full-back Brent Webb, who are all suffering the affects of tough domestic seasons. They have also lost second-row David Kidwell who will be flying back because of a family illness. However, such is the quality of New Zealand rugby league these days that they are sure to be tough and very physical opponents. In last night's match at Warrington, celebrating 100 years of international rugby league, the All Golds showed a willingness to offload and keep the ball alive that troubled the Northern Union and it is something that Great Britain can expect from the full New Zealand side. Of the All Golds who will be joining the Kiwi Test squad, David Faiumu proved to be a real handful at hooker while 19-year-old Sydney Roosters wing Shaun Kenny-Dowell showed some neat touches. With a number of places up for grabs in the Great Britain starting line-up, the Northern Union players certainly didn't lack motivation. Bradford's teenage prop sensation Sam Burgess started at loose forward and showed his power and -handling skills in setting up their first try for Danny McGuire. The 18-year-old, despite having a spell on the bench, won the man of the match award for a typical uncompromising performance that may well earn him a Britain debut in the coming weeks. McGuire was the only player from last week's Grand Final teams on show and the Leeds stand-off, who showed his finishing ability with two well taken tries, will be pushing Leon Pryce of St Helens for the Great Britain No 6 jersey. One concern for Tony Smith from the match was Adrian Morley and Danny Tickle being put on being put on report for high tackles that could jeopardise their participation in the Test series.Yeaman hobbled off midway through the second half after scoring the try that gave the home side the lead and his availability must be in doubt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
