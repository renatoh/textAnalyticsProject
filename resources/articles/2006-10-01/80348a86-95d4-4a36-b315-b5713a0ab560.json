With planning on the stadium entering a crucial stage, Olympic officials want to force a decision on its post-Games use early in the new year, a deadline that may be beyond the Hammers if Kia Joorabchian's bid falls through. According to an Olympic source \"the window of opportunity is closing\" for prospective tenants of the Stratford site, placing further pressure on the West Ham board to reach a quick decision. The Olympic Delivery Authority chief executive, David Higgins, told MPs yesterday that a football club willing to countenance an athletics track and contribute to the costs - \u00a3100m is the figure doing the rounds - would be welcome, but the ODA's timetable looks tight. The architects HOK are working towards an 80,000-seat stadium reducing to 25,000 after the games rather than a 60,000-capacity arena with retractable seats covering the track that football would favour. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport remains wedded to the stadium having a football club as an anchor tenant, so there is potential for a messy conclusion. Burns rejection may force grassroots funding cut As Football Association councillors ponder whether to oppose the Burns report at Friday's decisive vote the price of rejecting the reforms is becoming clear. Ditching Burns will effectively leave the FA \"unfit for purpose\" in the eyes of government, a position that could prompt a review of funding to Soho Square. Among the strands that will be considered is the \u00a33m from the National Sports Foundation - money that will be spent on improving facilities at the amateur clubs whose members the council are elected to represent. Ascot risks goodwill over meeting clash Ascot's inaugural National Hunt meeting this weekend is causing dismay at Wetherby, where there are concerns the Charlie Hall Chase, a traditional debut for leading chasers, could be overshadowed. Several trainers have entered contenders for both the Charlie Hall and Ascot's \u00a3100,000 United House Gold Cup. With the chief executive, Douglas Erskine Crum, leaving after overseeing the construction of a \u00a3120m grandstand with limited views of the track, Ascot can ill afford to sacrifice goodwill. To make matters worse the MP Philip Davies yesterday used the grandstand fiasco as a warning to London Olympic chiefs. \"We don't want another Wembley, and we don't want another Ascot,\" he said. Queen on Emirates duty The Queen's lack of enthusiasm for football is well known - her last FA Cup final was in 1976 - but she will doubtless hide her distaste tomorrow when she officially opens Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. An invitation to do likewise with Wembley cannot be ruled out, but a smarter bet might be for her grandson Prince William, the FA president, to hand over the first Cup back in the ground next year. Mitre's consolation prize Mitre suffered a significant blow earlier this year with the loss of the contract to produce balls for the England side, a contract it had held for decades. Some consolation comes in a renewed deal with the Football League that will see the 72 clubs punting Mitres hopefully upfield until 2011, by which time the association will have lasted 25 years. Friends in high places Shane Warne has revealed a friendship with Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay. According to Warne, the twirler and the troubadour met in a lift in 2001, and the cricketer has since been to dinner with Martin and his film actor wife, Gwyneth Paltrow. paul.kelso@ theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
