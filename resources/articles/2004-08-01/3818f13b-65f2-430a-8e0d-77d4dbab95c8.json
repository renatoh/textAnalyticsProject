But with pictures? It'll never catch on ... In a brave - perhaps even foolhardy - move, Radio 4 devotes its Book of the Week (9.45am) to the memoirs of John Logie Baird, inventor of the \"Mechanical Television System\", once widely touted as radio's nemesis. Born in Scotland in 1888, Baird first demonstrated a system that could transmit moving images as early as 1924. It was, for broadcast engineers, the holy grail, and the first primitive TV sets were on sale by 1928. Ironically, however, it was his arch-competitor Marconi who, in the 1930s, developed the system that became the industry standard. Baird foresaw how popular televised sport would become - he even masterminded the first live \"outside broadcast\", of the Epsom Derby in 1931. Sadly, though, Big Brother arrived on our screens about 50 years too late for us to canvas his opinion. Jazz may have predated television, but not by much, having emerged from New Orleans just before the turn of the 20th century. Radio 2 airs highlights from this year's BBC Jazz Awards (7pm), in London. Among those taking part are Wynton Marsalis, Amy Winehouse and Katie Melua. Piece of Cake (3.45pm, Radio 4), meanwhile, does exactly what it says on the tin. Each day this week, Sheila McClennon goes in search of the story behind a different confection from one of Britain's regions. Today it's Goosnargh (whatever that is). Tomorrow, Pontefract, then Chorley, Kendal mint cake and Eccles. Next week: indigestion remedies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
