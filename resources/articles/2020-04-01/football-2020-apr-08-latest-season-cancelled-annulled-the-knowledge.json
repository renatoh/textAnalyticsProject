Has there ever been a season that was completed and *then* annulled?\u201d Alex von Fintel supplies a highly comprehensive and very possibly unbeatable answer. \u201cThe 1922 German football championship, the 15th edition of the competition, saw no champion determined after the first final ended in a 2-2 draw and the replay in a 1-1 draw,\u201d he writes. \u201cHamburg were initially awarded the title because the other finalist, Nuremberg, had been down to seven players through injuries. In the break of the extra time of the replay one Nuremberg player decided he couldn\u2019t carry on, bringing his team below the required number of eight players on the field. \u201cHamburg was awarded the title but Nuremberg successfully protested \u2013 the referee should have blown to start the second half of extra time and then immediately blown his whistle to abandon. Hamburg understandably launched a counter-protest and were awarded the title \u2013 but then declined the championship, probably under pressure from the football authorities. So the 1921\u201322 season was effectively abandoned 0.1 seconds before it would have finished \u2013 and it really was the ref\u2019s fault.\u201d There have been famous cases of league titles being stripped from clubs for reasons of corruption after a season has been played. Marseille in 1992-93 and Juventus in 2005-06 were both denied the title with differing decisions taken on what happened to the trophy. PSG, despite finishing second, did not accept the French title while Internazionale did in Italy. But Alex\u2019s suggestion may take some beating. Maxwell house \u201cWhich player has won the most competitions?\u201d asks Glenn Coburn. \u201cSurely James Rodr\u00edguez must be up there; he has won 23 trophies in 14 different competitions.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is the definitive answer, but I once read the former Porto goalkeeper V\u00edtor Ba\u00eda had won 40 major competitions in his career,\u201d says Alan Gomes. \u201cThis link lists a mere 34 major trophies in 11 competitions.\u201d A couple of suggestions: Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s haul of the League Cup and Europa League with Manchester United took him to 16 different competitions if you include the Johan Cruyff Cup in the Netherlands, the Troph\u00e9e des Champions in France and the Community Shield, as his old friend Pep Guardiola would. Big Zlat\u2019s teammate at both Ajax and PSG, Maxwell, has won 16 too, having collected medals in Brazil, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and France. Striking goal droughts (2) Fergal Harrington has a suggestion to add to the previous Knowledge\u2019s lead-off item of famous strikers on goal droughts. \u201cJust one to add to the list is none other than Ireland and Liverpool legend John Aldridge who took 20 games to score his debut goal for Ireland,\u201d he says. That came against Tunisia in a 4-0 win in October 1988 at Lansdowne Road. Fergal offers mitigation for Aldo, who ended up scoring 19 goals in 69 matches, a much lower rate of scoring than his league record of 330 goals in 610 matches. \u201cThe tactics used by Big Jack Charlton probably were different to the way Liverpool were playing.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cWho were the first football club to have an official website?\u201d wondered Chris White back in 2016. \u201cI can help,\u201d yells Martyn Amos, thrusting his arm in the air. \u201cIpswich Town were the first club to have a website (unofficial or otherwise). In fact, I used to help maintain it. It was set up in 1990 by Phil Clarke, who worked at BT in Martlesham (near Ipswich) when the web was still very much experimental. He then passed it on (1993-1995) to Paul Felton, who was a student at UEA in Norwich (boo, hiss). \u201cAfter Paul graduated, he passed it on to me, as I was, at the time, a PhD student at Warwick (1995-1996). Paul then took it back in 1996, and ran it until 2001, when the club finally woke up to the potential of the web, and got a local company called AWS to run it \u2026 There used to be some discussion with Sheffield United fans about our claim to primacy, but I believe that it was decided in our favour.\u201d Can you help? \u201cWhile researching a quiz I\u2019ve compiled about Grimsby Town (if you\u2019ll allow the plug), I noticed that all eight of the fifth-round ties in the 1993 FA Cup were won by the home team,\u201d writes Tom Johnson. \u201cHas there ever been a last-32 in a cup competition with all 16 ties being won by the home team? Or any earlier round?\u201d \u201cHas a player ever celebrated a goal by kissing the badge of a club he was on loan to at the time?\u201d asks Tom, also. \u201cI was wondering if a player has ever scored 100 goals for three different clubs?\u201d wonders Dom Douglas. \u201cI can think of a few who have done it for two (Ronaldo, Cavani and Shearer spring to mind) but three would be a truly awesome feat.\u201d \u2022 Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
