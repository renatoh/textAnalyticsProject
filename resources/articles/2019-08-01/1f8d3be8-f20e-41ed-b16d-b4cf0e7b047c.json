Stocks plunged on Wall Street as the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank by more than 766 points (2.9%) \u2013 its worst trading day of the year \u2013 and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both fell 3% and 3.4% respectively amid fears that the trade war is intensifying. London-listed shares on the FTSE 100 fell by about 180 points, almost 2.5%, following steep losses on Asian markets. Asian markets were also weaker on Tuesday, with Australia\u2019s ASX200 down 2%, the Hang Seng off 0.7%, and the Nikkei down 0.7% by the middle of the day. Donald Trump renewed his attack on China, arguing in a flurry of tweets that Beijing was using currency manipulation and unfair trading practices to undermine jobs and company profits in America. \u201cChina is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of billions of dollars they have been taking from the US with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation. So one-sided it should have been stopped many years ago!\u201d he said. The latest Twitter tirade from the White House came after China allowed its currency, the yuan, to devalue against the dollar on Monday against a background of increasing tension in the long-running trade dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The International Monetary Fund has warned that global economic growth is slowing as Washington and Beijing raise the stakes in the standoff. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week to bolster US economic growth as concern rises over the health of the global economy. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) let the yuan weaken below the sensitive seven-to-one dollar level for the first time since 2008, in a step that some experts said could be used to \u201cweaponise\u201d the Chinese currency in the trade dispute. A weaker yuan could help Beijing offset the impact of the US tariffs, as Chinese goods would become more competitive for overseas buyers. Trump threatened last week to impose punitive import tariffs on $300bn (\u00a3246.9bn) of Chinese imports, in a move that would effectively slap tariffs on all exports to the US from China. Beijing on Friday threatened to retaliate without saying exactly how it would respond. Economists said China allowing the yuan to devalue was a clear result of the threat made by Trump, although it also comes as Beijing increasingly allows the currency to move in line with market pressures. Julian Evans-Pritchard of the consultancy Capital Economics said: \u201cThe fact that they have now stopped defending 7.00 against the dollar suggests that they have all but abandoned hopes for a trade deal with the US.\u201d By linking the devaluation with Trump\u2019s renewed tariff threat, \u201cthe PBOC has effectively weaponised the exchange rate,\u201d he added. The FTSE 100 closed down 2.5% at 7,223 points on Monday, as Germany\u2019s Dax index fell by about 1.8% and France\u2019s Cac40 fell by about 2.2%. The losses extended a sell-off begun last week after Trump shocked investors with the threat of higher tariffs on $300bn of Chinese imports to the US. While the taxes are paid by US importers of Chinese goods to US customs, Trump argued on Twitter that China was paying for them. Economists warn that US consumers are hit by rising prices of imported goods. Still, the president tweeted: \u201cIt is now even more obvious to everyone that Americans are not paying for the Tariffs \u2013 they are being paid for compliments of China, and the U.S. is taking in tens of Billions of Dollars!\u201d According to Reuters China\u2019s central bank linked the yuan\u2019s weakness to the fallout from the country\u2019s trade war with the US. The PBOC said: \u201cUnder the influence of factors including unilateralism, protectionist trade measures, and expectations of tariffs against China, the yuan has depreciated against the dollar today, breaking through 7 yuan per dollar.\u201d China had previously refrained from devaluing the currency as talks with the US appeared to be progressing. However, analysts warned that the trade dispute was gradually spinning out of control. Keith Wade and Craig Botham of the City investment firm Schroders, said: \u201cChina had wanted tariffs to be removed as part of any deal, so by doing the opposite Trump was effectively delivering a rebuke. \u201cThe problem now is that both sides could get into a position where they cannot back down without losing face. Consequently, the prospect of a deal has diminished and the risks of escalation have risen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
