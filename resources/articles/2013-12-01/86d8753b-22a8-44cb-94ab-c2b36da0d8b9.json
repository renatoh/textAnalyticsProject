There have been recent signs, however, that the Wanderers are discovering the chord sequences and swagger that had fans and critics throwing their knickers last season, and Monday night\u2019s slick win over the Central Coast Mariners \u2013 one that demonstrated an attacking hunger relatively lacking in previous matches \u2013 was arguably their best performance of the campaign. It was surely no coincidence that Youssouf Hersi, Shinji Ono, Tomi Juric and Jerome Polenz were all on the park. The Wanderers opponents on Saturday night, the Melbourne Victory, are themselves enjoying a nice run, and they\u2019ll be heading into this clear match-of-the-round having won back-to-back games for the first time under Kevin Muscat. The Melbourne Heart\u2019s propensity for firing rounds into their own feet aided Victory in Saturday\u2019s derby but with the excellent Mitch Nichols engineering openings in the Heart defence, and with James Troisi and Kosta Barbarouses exploiting his work, Muscat\u2019s men finished the game strongly. Shutting down Nichols will be high on the Wanderers\u2019 list of priorities on Saturday night, as will tracking the runs of the dangerous Adama Traore. If the Wanderers let Hersi off the leash and bring the same desire for goals they showed on Monday (though playing away, they mightn\u2019t actually feel obliged to do that) we could be in for a treat. A Christmas miracle After Wellington\u2019s win over Sydney FC last round the Melbourne Heart remain the only winless side in the competition. Considering that you\u2019d think it fair enough that John Aloisi\u2019s position has been questioned by Mark Bosnich and many, many others, but you can understand Aloisi bristling all the same. He\u2019s found himself painted into a corner and he\u2019s aggrieved. And so he should be. The brush is in his hand. What will be interesting to see, however, is how he reacts should the Heart beat the Phoenix at AAMI Park on Friday night (hey, it\u2019s not that unrealistic, and it is Christmas, a time of miracles \u2013 the main one being that we don\u2019t all kill each other in the lead up). So many coaches (and players) in similar situations act as if that drought-breaking win (or century, or goal, or try, or whatever) has put paid to any criticism. But it\u2019ll take more than one swallow for Aloisi\u2019s summer to be proof of anything, so perhaps he\u2019ll avoid this well-trodden path and recognize that there will be a lot to do yet. But of course I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. The Heart have to win yet. The thing is, I\u2019ve a feeling in my waters that this week is the week (and if I continue to say this every week then eventually I\u2019ll actually be right). The Heart were much better last week than the 0-3 scoreline suggested, and Kewell will benefit from the hit out, while the Heart will further benefit on Friday night from Patrick Kisnorbo not being around to get himself sent off. The Phoenix, meantime, facing the Heart for the first time this season (Adelaide and Perth have already played each other three times!) will miss the unlucky Paul Ifill, and their recent busy schedule might well catch up with them. Shooting stars We\u2019ve seen some cracking goals this season \u2013 just like Juric\u2019s bicycle kick on Monday \u2013 but it\u2019s the bread and butter openings the league\u2019s strikers are finding harder to convert this season. So many chances, good chances, have been shanked, sliced, scuffed, miscued, tamely poked or errantly smashed, thus proving to be more of a risk to the portly gentleman with the tray of beers shuffling along row Z than the opposition goal. It seems every team, barring Brisbane Roar, have publically lamented their inability to convert chances and possession into goals. For some teams, like Heart, Victory, Phoenix and Adelaide especially, it\u2019s become an all too familiar refrain. Is more shooting practice needed, perhaps? While some strikers are struggling to repeat their deeds of last season (were Daniel McBreen and Jeremy Brockie\u2019s 17 and 16 goals respectively an aberration, meaning now they\u2019re returning to type?), others, like Juric, Troisi, Adam Taggart and Mitchell Duke are striving to fulfill their promise. At this stage, however, it\u2019s still just that: promise. Troisi (more an attacking mid than an out-and-out striker) leads the race for the golden boot with seven goals in 11 games, but with the chances he fails to convert you wouldn\u2019t call him lethal. So 11 rounds in and no one, apart from Brisbane\u2019s Besart Berisha (five goals in seven starts), has yet struck fear into the heart of the opposition. Let\u2019s hope this changes. The legacy of Taylor Swift As if Taylor Swift doesn\u2019t have enough to answer for, she almost certainly played a role in Brisbane\u2019s surprise loss to Newcastle last week, what with her concert ruining the playing surface at Suncorp Stadium, something which stymied Brisbane\u2019s inclination to play a fast game on the deck. After enduring that defeat Mike Mulvey will not only be pulling down any Swift posters he\u2019s Blu-Tacked to his bedroom wall but he\u2019ll have his players primed to take out their frustrations on a Sydney team who, for the ninth time in 11 visits, came away from Wellington without a win, thus continuing their up-and-down season. But that\u2019s Sydney; beautiful one day, perfectly ordinary the next. The last time these two teams met Brisbane, despite the early loss of Berisha to injury, won 4-0. Sydney, without Alessandro del Piero, were unable to stem Roar\u2019s onrushing midfield and it was three goals in seven minutes that killed them. This time around, Sydney will be delighted that Berisha, a regular thorn in their side, is out with a hip injury (Henrique is set to replace him, and Kwame Yeboah should feature in what will be his last match before departing for Borussia Monchengladbach). At the same time, Del Piero is expected to return, so that\u2019s a double bonus for the home side. Even so, you\u2019d expect the Roar to have too much creativity in midfield. Unless of course Swift comes back to haunt the Roar. She played at Allianz on 4 December and left the away end in a mess. Mulvey will be hoping all signs that she was there have long gone. Adelaide\u2019s worm can continue to turn After all their well-publicised frustrations this year Adelaide could see out 2013 in a manner that has them feeling optimistic for 2014, which is more than most of us can hope for. Two weeks ago they had a much-needed second win of the season, and last week in Perth they kept a second-straight clean sheet in drawing with the Glory. A win over Newcastle on Sunday could see Josep Gombau\u2019s side draw within three points of the top six should other results go their way. Considering Adelaide\u2019s slow start and the fact there will still be 15 matches of the regular season remaining it would reinforce Gombau\u2019s insistence that building a winning team takes time and that in a long A-League season where, most generously, six out of 10 teams make the finals, it\u2019s time you actually have. Newcastle have shown they\u2019re no pushover and they\u2019ll be relying on employing a compact defence and getting men behind the ball in order to frustrate Adelaide, just as it frustrated Brisbane last week. Adelaide, however, could benefit from the return of Sergio Cirio, Fabio Ferreira, and Daniel Bowles, and with Marcelo Carrusca in a rich vein of form, don\u2019t bet against the worm continuing to turn for the Reds.
