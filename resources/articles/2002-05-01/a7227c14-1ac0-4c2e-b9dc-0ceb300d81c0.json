Reviewing The Majestic puts me in an awkward position because the truth is, this excruciatingly sentimental film made me gag early and often. Phony as a three-dollar bill, this fusion of Meet John Doe, The Return of Martin Guerre, Les Miserables and several other films too ghastly to mention is one of those fiercely manipulative movies that simultaneously tugs on your heartstrings while jamming your head into a cement mixer. In the process it permanently puts to rest any notion that Jim Carrey can \"act\". As Frank Darabont's characteristically insipid movie opens (he last directed The Green Mile), Peter Appleton (Carrey), a shallow, starry-eyed young screenwriter, is taking his girlfriend to see his first film, a piece of fluff called Sand Pirates Of The Sahara. It is 1954 in the City of the Angels, and Appleton is on his way straight to the top. But then disaster strikes. The dreaded House Un-American Activities Committee is hunting down Hollywood commies. Though a war veteran himself, the guileless Appleton attended a couple of seemingly harmless \"meetings\" while in college, never suspecting that the people sponsoring these confabs were malignant reds. (Apparently, Los Angeles newspapers didn't report much on Stalin back in those days.) Now the innocent mistakes of youth have come back to haunt him. He is fired from his job. His girlfriend dumps him. He gets drunk and ends up driving his car off a bridge somewhere in Northern California. When he re-awakens, he has lost his memory. A kindly stranger happens upon the poor kid and takes him to a nearby, picture-postcard town. Jeepers, Peter is the spitting image of Luke Trimble, a beloved local hero who died 10 years ago in the war. Naturally, Luke was a football hero engaged to the prettiest girl in town. Landsakes, how folks have missed him! No one more than his dad, a spry old coot played by the venerable ham Martin Landau, who was forced to close his movie theatre (The Majestic) after Luke disappeared. But now that Luke has resurfaced, he can fix up the old dump and let the town kick up its heels. Appleton, whose amnesia has not yet turned him into a complete idiot, is not so sure about any of this. He certainly does not remember the town, his girlfriend, his father or anybody named Luke. (It never seems to occur to anyone in the film to check fingerprints or dental records or compare birthmarks.) But he knows enough to realise that the days of the good old movie houses are over, that TV is taking over the world. Dad persuades him otherwise. Inside the old theatre, there was magic, \"if you could only look around and see it.\" Once you stepped through those doors you left your worries behind. There was Chaplin. And Keaton. And Garbo. And Cagney. Mercifully, the pre-war line-up did not include Martin Landau. Like most celluloid amnesiacs, Peter has a highly selective memory. He cannot remember who he is or where he came from but he can remember the dialogue from the closing scene of Dreyfus, in which Paul Muni played the crusading Emile Zola. Needless to say, it was Dreyfus that inspired Peter's girlfriend Adele to become a lawyer, because everything in this film is inspired by movies. Unfortunately, Appleton cannot recall whom Adele is or what his relationship with her was before he went off to war. But as he replies when she asks if he remembers her: \"No. But I'm sure willing to try.\" Meanwhile, back in Washington, the feds are convinced that Peter's disappearance is proof that he is a dangerous Soviet spy. In one scene, an FBI agent - an implacable, puny dork - tracks an insect around his office and kills it with a fly swatter. This is the director's byzantinely subtle way of hinting tothe audience that the government is going after a flea with an elephant gun. I know this sort of thing, because I have watched many famous films and studied symbolism in high school. Like director Frank Darabont's previous hits The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption, The Majestic is a turgid, contrived mess. It is one of those infuriatingly cloying films filled with feisty octogenarians, wise old Negroes, evil bureaucrats and perky waitresses named - what else? - Mabel. It is the kind of movie where the leading lady gets the hiccups before she kisses her beau, where the entire town gathers in a diner to get the latest scuttlebutt, where lovers literally gambol through the fields, legs and arms akimbo. And, in the case of the Gumby-like Carrey, mega-akimbo. If it weren't so smugly self-righteous, you would swear this film was a parody. For Carrey the film is a disaster. Though many find him an acquired taste to begin with, I personally found him hilarious in The Mask, Dumb And Dumber, the first Ace Ventura film and The Grinch, and also admired his work as a deranged prole in the underrated Cable Guy. But he was less convincing once he shed the comic mask in The Truman Show, and here, having shelved his manic personality entirely, he resembles a juggler trying to perform his tricks with both hands tied behind his back. Or Woody Allen trying to imitate Ingmar Bergman. Or John Cleese in his \"serious\" roles. He thus finds himself in the weird position of trying to escape from the straitjacket of moronic slapstick by making a serious film that in its own way is infinitely more moronic than Dumb And Dumber. Or, put it this way: Carrey's comic films may be dumb, but at least they're not stupid. In The Majestic, the Man of a Thousand Faces limits himself to about three facial expressions: eye-rolling confusion, a goofy blank stare, sheepish infatuation. He is the only person in the film who is actually more annoying than Martin Landau. I can think of no more damning indictment.
