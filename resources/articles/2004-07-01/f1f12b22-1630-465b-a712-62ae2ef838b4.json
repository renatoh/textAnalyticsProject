Kizzi (17), Tenza (19) and Emma (17) deliver just that on their debut album, a fine mix of dancehall reggae and hip hop-informed soul. The single 'Too Hot' is classic feelgood stuff and proves how refreshing it can be to have toasting rather than crass rap or crummy US vocal noodling as filler between the choruses; 'Bring it On' echoes Beyonc\u00e9's 'Crazy in Love' and 'Lift up Yuh Hand' could go a round with 'Bootylicious'. True, lyrically much of the album is about complete trivia but then the girls surprise with the insightful 'Miss Smith', about a girl falling prey to a greedy drug dealer. Home-grown talent to brighten up a dull summer. Mike Ladd Nostalgialator (!K7) New York underground hip hop luminary Mike Ladd appears to have two concept album trilogies on the go at the same time. Best known is his critique of the state of hip hop, laid out in the fables of The Infesticons (2000) and The Majesticons (2003). The other strand is longer in the gestation, beginning with Easy Listening for Armageddon (1997) followed by Welcome to the Afterfuture (2003), and now this. Apparently The End has happened, the future is now irrelevant and we need machines to help us cope - hence the Nostalgialator, a device to transport you away from the horrid reality of now to the bliss of the past. What ensues is a strange, enchanting blend of scattershot vocal deliveries over hard, punky hip hop beats, jazzy Beat poetry (the lovely 'How Electricity Really Works'), echoes of Var\u00e8se's ionisations on the title track and a slew of nauseating synthesisers ('shitty keys', as Ladd puts it in the sleeve notes) that would have made Zappa proud. Strange, intriguing, best in small doses. The Honeymoon Dialogue (RCA/BMG) Don't let the style mags fool you. Iceland's Thorunn Magnusdottir and Hackney's Wayne Murray may be very pretty and have wastrel/ waif chic, and the former may have a voice like a more syrupy (is it possible?) Edie Brickell or Harriet Wheeler (the Sundays); the musical stylings may tick all the chilled, post-dance, Zero 7 boxes, and the songs take the form of the dialogue of the title (the pair were originally called the Lovers, even though they're not, apparently); but the material just isn't up to it. True, there are some nice string arrangements and the odd bit of quirky programming, but on the whole the duo sound like nothing so much as Dido aspiring to be early Doves. And how dare she namecheck Bowie? Totally bogus. BJ Cole Trouble in Paradise (Cooking Vinyl) Cole, the undisputed king of steel guitar in the UK, won high praise for his collaboration with admired beat doctor Luke Vibert (alias Wagon Christ) for 2000's Stop the Panic . Here he works with various programmers and other musicians (Vibert among them) to create what amounts to an uneasy trip around the United States. There's a hard edge to his guitar on the title track and a real sense of paranoia in the ticking hats discord of 'The Interloper'. Larry Love provides gutsy, dirty vocals on the Alabama 3 collaboration 'Are You Ready for Some Country?'; elsewhere, Geoff McIntire growls about leopardskin, lipstick and Vegas on 'Casino Tan'. Sometimes the music is hard going ('Milkshake Roadmap' has a truly evil Nord Lead line, and it's a relief when the animal techno of Luke Vibert's 'Surf Acid Hoedown' breaks down to half-time for the middle), but these difficult moments are balanced with lush interludes ('Keep Your Head', 'Downtown Motel Blues'). The closing track, 'Elle sait o\u00f9 elle va', showcases Cole's lush mastery under Laura B's multilayered vocals. Tanya Donelly Whiskey Tango Ghosts (4AD) The first thing you think on hearing the former Throwing Muse's solo effort is that she's done a Norah Jones. That same sweet, lush quality to her voice; the same sparse, simple backings. But that's not entirely fair. Not everything here slips down so peanut butter-smooth. For every wash of pedal steel there's a quirk: the sustained, tumbling piano lines which round off the opening track, 'Divine Sweet Divide'; the nicely wrong-headed chord structure in the melting plucked electric guitar of 'Butterfly Thing'; the weird high harmonies which break into 'My Life as a Ghost'. Plus, Donelly has a mature songwriting flair and knows how to play for effect - the near-spoken starts to the verses of 'Just in Case You Quit Me' only add charm to the lyrics of this end-of-the- line lament, and throughout you know she is telling it from the heart. A solid, if understated, piece of work. The Memory Band The Memory Band (Hungry Hill) Stephen Cracknell, whose career to date has included a stint playing bass for Badly Drawn Boy and obscure EPs of electronica as Gorodisch, co-founded Trunk Records, the label which reissued the soundtrack to The Wicker Man . Here he mines the same bizarre English pastoral vein, at times sounding like an updated Penguin Caf\u00e9 Orchestra and pulling in everything from a brass section ('Theme for the Memory Band') to autoharp ('Once Bittern') to augment a tapestry of beats, guitar and (found) harmonium. This is ideal music to fall asleep to. I mean that in a good way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
