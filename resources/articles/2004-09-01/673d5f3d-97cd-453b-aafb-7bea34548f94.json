What time do you normally get into school? About 8? And what time do you normally leave? About 6? So you can begin to see where the education secretary's coming from. If you're spending 10 hours a day at the school, it seems a waste of resources not to get the kids to put in the same sort of effort. OK, I know the reason you put in the overtime is to keep up with your lesson preparation and the stack of paperwork, not to mention getting a few hours blessed relief from your own kids back home, and you're going to struggle to fit all that in if you've got 300 schoolchildren to police, but you've got to remember that the bottom line is you're a public servant. So be prepared to get serving. The country has problems. Tax revenues are down, public spending is up and a general election is on the horizon. Something's got to give, and that something is you. What's the main gripe of working parents? The cost of after-school childcare. Turning schools into an extended cr\u00e8che facility is an idea of pure genius. It kills three birds with one stone. It means no more tax breaks for childcare; it addresses concerns of falling educational standards by providing the illusion kids will be up to their necks in trigonometry for an extra three hours a day; and it will have the middle classes deserting the independent sector in hordes at the prospect of not having to shell out for an east European au pair. The only downside is that the people carriers will clog the roads in rush hour, rather than at 3.30, but that's probably a price worth paying. No one's trying to pretend this is going to be easy for you. Your lunchtimes have already been KO-ed to do random security checks on the kiddies' crisps and colas to make sure they don't turn out as chubby as the education secretary. Now you're going to lose the rest of your free time. Trying to get the kids to do anything meaningful after lunch has always been an uphill struggle, so you're basically facing a five-hour white knuckle ride in crowd control until the parental straitjackets turn up at 6pm. You will obviously be rewarded for your extra input. Though not necessarily that generously. You may be offered an extra \u00a32,000 and you may also get a little help at the tail end of the day from Securicor, but the government will reckon it's got a good deal. And there's not much you can do about it because this is an initiative that is bound to play well with the punters. And be warned. This is only the start. It won't be long before the school terms are extended. After all, there's no point in getting rid of the need for a nanny in term-time if people still have to fork out for childcare in the holidays. So the logical step is to make the school year resemble the working year, with five or six weeks' holiday. Just be thankful no one's talking about you working nights.
