The club acted after the 21-year-old Benfica midfielder was offered to them by Jorge Mendes, the agent who has historical links to their manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Mendes recently started to work with Fernandes. West Ham had shown an interest in Fernandes but they came to fear on Friday that Spurs were set to move ahead of them and take the player, who has two caps for Portugal and is rated as a prospect for the future. He can play in central midfield or on the right. Whether he is able to have an immediate impact in the Premier League remains to be seen. Mourinho, who is a man down in midfield after losing Moussa Sissoko to a knee ligament injury until mid-April, has made it clear he wants to bolster a squad that has imbalances, although he has stopped short of demanding the chairman, Daniel Levy, makes moves this month. Mourinho knows funds at the club are tight. \u201cIf the boss arrives with a solution that can help us to face these difficult months that we are going to have ahead of us then [it is] welcome,\u201d Mourinho said on Friday. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t find the right solution then we are going to wait for the summer.\u201d Spurs\u2019 line has been that if the right player was to be available this month and he represented a sound investment for the longer-term rather than a quick fix, they would consider it. In what is a market for opportunists, they have come to see Fernandes, who has also been linked with Everton, Lyon and Manchester United, as ticking the boxes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
