Although there were no penalties for a positive test in 2003, confidential testing was conducted by Major League Baseball in agreement with the players' union to determine if random testing should be introduced in the following year. \"I did take a banned substance. For that I'm very sorry and deeply regretful,\" Rodriguez said in response to a report in Sports Illustrated that he had been one of 104 players who had tested positive that year. The magazine claimed the Yankees' third baseman had tested positive for a steroid and the male hormone testosterone. Rodriguez, 33, baseball's highest paid player and one year into a 10-year $275m contract with the Yankees, said he had cheated during his three seasons with the Texas Rangers starting in 2001 but not since. \"When I arrived in Texas in 2001 I felt an enormous amount of pressure. I felt like I had all the weight of the world on top of me to perform and perform at a high level every day,\" he said. \"Back then it was a different culture. It was very loose. I was young, I was stupid, I was naive. And I wanted to prove to everyone that I was worth being one of the greatest players of all time. \"Although it was part of the culture back then, I'm sorry for that time. I'm sorry for my fans. I'm sorry for my fans in Texas. \"It wasn't until then that I ever thought about a substance of any kind and since then I've proven to myself and to everyone that I don't need any of that.\" Results of the confidential testing were obtained by the government in conjunction with the investigation into the San Francisco laboratory BALCO and its alleged link with Barry Bonds, baseball's home-run record holder. Rodriguez, the youngest player to hit 500 home runs and, now on 553, on course to overtake Bonds' record of 762, said he did not even know the name of the drugs he was taking. \"It was such a loosey-goosey era that I'm guilty for a lot of things. I'm guilty for being negligent, naive, not asking all the right questions,\" he said. \"To be quite honest, I don't know exactly what substance I was guilty of using.\" However, despite his apology, the head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, is far from impressed. \"He claims to be sorry that he used hardcore steroids but it is obvious he is only sorry that he got caught,\" said Tygart. \"If he was sorry, he would have admitted it in advance and would not have provided a stone-faced denial to the American public in 2007 when he claimed he had never used or considered using performance-enhancing drugs. There are obviously many more questions that must be answered.\" After the release of MLB's Mitchell Report in 2007, which found there had been widespread doping abuse in baseball but left Rodriguez unnamed, the Yankee slugger denied any involvement. Since the introduction of random testing in 2004 MLB has instituted tough penalties for doping offenders \u2013 a 50-game suspension for a first offence, 100 games for a second and a lifetime ban for a third positive test. Rodriguez, thrice the American League Most Valuable Player, does not appear likely to face punishment but his status as one of the game's greatest players has been cast into doubt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
