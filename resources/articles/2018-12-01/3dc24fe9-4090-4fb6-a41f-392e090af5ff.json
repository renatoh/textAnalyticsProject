Thomas still looks totally stunned on stage, as other winners engage in small talk around him. Thomas doesn\u2019t seem a big Ezra fan on the face of it. Some words from Thomas: \u201cAs a bike rider, I was always focused on myself, but hearing stories like Tyson [Fury] and Billy [Jean King], then seeing kids on their bikes back home, you take great pride in winning this. It\u2019s been an amazing year for British sport and long may it continue.\u201d A big puff of the cheeks by the Welshman, as he runs up to collect the award. \u201cI really should have thought about what I was going to say,\u201d Thomas says, totally lost for words, before thanking his family. \u201cI was going down the local leisure centre to ride my bike and now I\u2019m stood here. To see so many kids, and not just kids, out riding a bike and enjoying a healthy lifestyle, that brings so much pride.\u201d The runner-up was Lewis Hamilton. In third place was Harry Kane, much to the amazement of Dina Asher-Smith down in the front row. Thomas goes on to thank \u201cDave B\u201d. He\u2019s the first Welshman to win since Ryan Giggs in 2009. Billy Monger is back \u2013 after his speech was cut off abruptly earlier on! He has a quick, big thank you for his mother and father. Monger was presented with the Helen Rollason award, after making an extraordinary comeback to motor racing, less than 12 months after having both legs amputated. Even Lineker is tearing-up. Their last-gasp win Down Under clinches it. Tracey Neville, the coach, says: \u201cWe\u2019re just so happy, thank you so much everyone.\u201d Gold medal winners at the Commonwealth Games, Tracey Neville\u2019s side did remarkably, ousting tournament favourites Australia in their own back yard to record victory in their first ever major final. It was a mightily tight affair, with England eventually prospering 52-51 in the dying seconds. There is an argument Neville, sister of the footballers Gary and Phil Neville, could have taken home the coach of the year too. Victory on the Gold Coast was a catalyst for the whole sport, with 130,000 women and counting taking up netball following their big win. And now they have another. Team of the Year time, and here come \u2013 hang on a minute \u2013 Marc Albrighton and Wes Morgan, part of the title-winning Leicester team, to present the award. The contenders? England football, Ireland rugby union, Celtic, England netball, European Ryder Cup, Manchester City, Mercedes F1, Team Sky. Tyson Fury is next up on stage, though he is not among those shortlisted for the main award. Re-living that moment when it looked as though he was finished against Deontay Wilder, and bounced back. \u201cMany men would have stayed down after getting knocked down by Deontay Wilder but I wanted to show that you always must continue to keep getting up, fight back, no matter what you are going through, because we need to spread the word on mental health,\u201d Fury says. \u201cIf I can do it, a 6ft9in, 18st man, you know, I\u2019m supposed to be a big tough guy. Anyone can do it.\u201d A montage of those we have lost in 2018 is played out on the big screen. Among them, Sir Roger Bannister, Maria Bueno, Enzo Calzaghe, Brendan Ingle, Roy Bentley, Carol Mann, Ray Wilson, Eric Bristow, Ray Wilkins, Jimmy Armfield, Cyrille Regis. The Italian had a 2018 to remember; it was a year that surpassed his wildest dreams as he won his first major and was instrumental in Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup victory, leading the charge as they thrashed the USA, winning all five of his matches. After soaring up the world rankings thanks to winning the PGA Championship at Wentworth \u2013 the European Tour\u2019s flagship event \u2013 and his maiden PGA Tour victory, he went on to win the Open at Carnoustie. A rather humbled Molinari beats off competition from Ester Ledecka, Oleksandr Usyk and Simone Biles to win the World Sports Star of the Year award; it has been some 12 months for Mr Molinari. Now we have David Ginola, stood in front of a green screen of the Eiffel Tower, bigging up the Ryder Cup in France, while Bruce Springsteen classic Born in the USA belts out behind him. \u201cMerci,\u201d says Lineker, as Molinari, Harrington, Fleetwood and co rock up on stage. \u00c7a plane pour moi time now too. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible season,\u201d Molinari says. \u201cWhen you share it with your friends, it makes it extra special.\u201d The Unsung Hero of the year goes to ... Kirsty Ewen! A swimming volunteer, Ewen overcame mental health issues to inspire others to do the same and get active. \u201cA teenage me didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it past my 18th birthday,\u201d she says. \u201cI just want to make it known that there is always hope to hold on to. I just want to thank everybody who has supported and inspired me. I hope I can inspire others.\u201d The voting is open, but you already know that. A gentle reminder that the Big Six, as such, for the main award this evening are: \u2022 Harry Kane \u2022 Dina Asher-Smith \u2022 Lewis Hamilton \u2022 James Anderson \u2022 Lizzy Yarnold \u2022 Geraint Thomas Dina Asher-Smith, another nominee for the big one, is on stage. The 22-year-old is the fastest British woman in the country and enjoyed a sublime year. She became the first British women to win three golds at the same European Championships, winning the 100m, 200m and 4x100m events. \u201cI quite like the world rankings the way they are now,\u201d she says. \u201cThe reception when I got home from Berlin was what really resonated with me. Go for your dreams, work hard and go for it. Not everything comes at once.\u201d Frank Skinner has a quick thank you for Gareth Southgate, who is wearing what looks like an Aston Villa tie. \u201cThank you so much for the royalties,\u201d he says, earning a big cheesy laugh from the crowd. Southgate is busy giving his acceptance speech but, right on cue, a few Birmingham lads in the crowd are belting out a rendition of \u201cSouthgate, you\u2019re the one!\u201d to the tune of that almighty Atomic Kitten number. Southgate, once the lads quieten down, says England won\u2019t rest on their laurels until they\u2019ve gone all the way. Who else, really? The M&amp;S waistcoat was a winner from the off and, even though his team did not crusade to victory in Russia, they won the hearts of millions of once apathetic supporters. A soar in the demand of his services as an after-dinner speaker, a tube stationed was named after him post-World Cup and now the reports of an OBE winging its way to him tell you all you need to know about how Southgate successfully restored the bond between staff, players and fans. And, rather excitingly, he says this is only just the start. \u201cIf it ever does come home, Lord knows what it will be like,\u201d Lineker admits on stage, introducing the guv\u2019nor, the gaffer Gareth Southgate and the England skipper, Harry Kane. \u201cIt was such a whirlwind,\u201d the captain says. \u201cWe wanted to do the nation proud, we had that reconnection with the fans and I\u2019m not sure we truly appreciate how mad it was going back here. We heard it was a bit mental.\u201d Southgate adds: \u201cThere was a disconnection with the fans for a long period and that was understandable, but great credit to the players. I think people are proud of the way the players represented their country.\u201d Asked if it\u2019s ever going to come home, Kane, naturally says: \u201cHopefully, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to.\u201d It\u2019s coming home! Time for a good-ol-fashioned Fifa World Cup montage. And a rather unique rendition of the Lightning Seeds at the NEC. We have steel drums, a band of dancers, a flurry of trumpets, choirs and oh so much more. And now we have Baddiel and Skinner up on stage. Lovely stuff. \u201cThree Lions on the shirt!\u201d Baddiel is crooning, Birmingham bouncing. No expense spared. For anyone dazed, or puzzled, England didn\u2019t actually win the thing. On her fight for equality, Billie Jean King adds: \u201cEveryone who played [tennis] was white. And I asked myself, where is everybody else? At 12, I commited myself to fight for equality and inclusion for all, for the rest of my life. Each of us is an influencer, every single one of us. If you can see it, you can be it.\u201d Ain\u2019t No Mountain High Enough belts out of the speakers, as Billie Jean King steps up on stage to collect her Lifetime Achievement award. King says: \u201cIt means so much to have Sue [Barker] present this to me, a friend, fellow player and a broadcasting legend. Thank you for including me in this historic, historic evening. This part of the world has played a major role in my life and my career. I won my first national championship at the Irish Open in 1963, and I won my final WTA tour title right here in Birmingham in 1983. Next year, I\u2019ll be going to Wimbledon again. It will be my 59th year going; it\u2019s like a second home to me.\u201d The 75-year-old former world No 1 wins the lifetime award, celebrating a career packed with Grand Slam titles, no fewer than 39 of them. King, undoubtedly one of the greatest tennis players of all time, won the inaugural singles title of the Open era 50 years ago and jetted into London on Friday. One of her most famous contributions was the \u201cbattle of the sexes\u201d match, a game televised in 1973 against Bobby Riggs, which King won in three sets. The match attracted massive attention and was viewed by an estimated 90 million people. Away from the court, she has valiantly fought for equality while, earlier this year, King and her partner Ilana Kloss became minority owners of the LA Dodgers. It\u2019s time for the Lifetime Achievement award. Sue Barker will do the honours. \u201cAs a youngster, I dreamt of playing professional tennis but that at the time didn\u2019t look possible,\u201d she says. \u201cThen, all of sudden, it changed. And it changed because of one person.\u201d The focus turns to Geraint Thomas, the winner of this year\u2019s Tour de France. The Welshman trudges on to the stage \u2013 not wearing the yellow jersey, sadly. \u201cI knew you were going to play me crying [in the montage],\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like at my wedding, without trying to sound all macho I didn\u2019t really think about it then I got to the church and was like, ooh, \u2018It\u2019s quite a big deal, this\u2019. Suddenly all of that emotion hit me. It had been my dream since the age of about 10.\u201d What does it mean to be a contender for the big one? \u201cIt\u2019s something I have always watched as a kid. It\u2019s like the start of Christmas, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s an honour.\u201d Ooooooh Jimmy, Jimmy! Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy Anderson! The England bowler, up for the top award, is up on stage having a chinwag with Gary Lineker. A few of his team-mates are there too; Alastair Cook, Joe Root and co. \u201cWhen you get to 30 people say you need to start thinking about retiring, but I just want to keep going as long as I can,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cI loved playing sport as a kid, and I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to play it for 15-20 years, and am grateful I\u2019m still playing it.\u201d Asked how many balls he\u2019s bowled in test-match cricket, he estimates over 10,000. The answer? 31,746. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot,\u201d says Lineker. \u201cWe want to get the Ashes back,\u201d Anderson adds. \u201cHopefully we can do it next summer. It\u2019s dusty in here, isn\u2019t it? Sigur R\u00f3s rings round the NEC as the extraordinary Billy Monger is up on stage, collecting the Helen Rollason award. The 19-year-old had both legs amputated following a crash during a Formula 4 race at Donington Park and returned to racing less than a year, in Formula 3, after the accident. Lewis Hamilton presents Monger with the award. Doctors and nurses who helped Monger are also on stage. In his acceptance speech, he pays to tribute to the late Bradley Lowery, whose parents took the award last year. \u201cQuite simply, without these guys I might not be here today,\u201d he says of those on stage. \u201cIt\u2019s a real honour to be able to share the stage with them. They saved my life, it\u2019s really quite as simple as that.\u201d Harry Kane is the bookies\u2019 favourite to win the top award. Read into that what you will. Geraint Thomas and Lewis Hamilton are next on the list. Kane took home the Golden Boot from the World Cup last summer, though as much as he was captain there is argument to be made that the likes of Jordan Pickford and Harry Maguire exuded more personality, a little more je ne sais quoi. Anyway, Hamilton\u2019s up on stage. The five-time champion says: \u201cThe eight-year-old me today would be telling me, hopefully, that he\u2019s proud. As for equalling Michael Schumacher\u2019s record of seven world titles, he says: \u201cIt is honestly not my target. My target is just to grow as a man, and as a competitor.\u201d \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Jonathan Rea on the Spoty shortlist?\u201d muses Stephen Manlow on email. \u201cHe\u2019s won World Superbikes for four years running!\u201d Indeed, Rea came a surprise second to Farah last year. Is there a dash of because he was in the mix last year he cannot be this time? Who knows. There are bound to be an army of Tyson Fury fans who feel he should have been among the six names too. Time for Lizzy Yarnold, in her own words. \u201cI had intense dizziness, I felt drunk, like I was about to black out,\u201d she says of that run at the Winter Olympics. \u201cMy team pushed me to go again. We all dared to dream it was possible. It was the perfect way to say goodbye.\u201d On the stage this evening, she adds: \u201cEven though it looks like a physical game, it\u2019s in many ways a mental game. Luckily, I had people who believed in me even when I didn\u2019t.\u201d We have a football montage, ladies and gentleman, glimpses of Manchester City and Liverpool, Pep Guardiola\u2019s mammoth Stone Island coat and clips of Sadio Man\u00e9 finding the net (sound familiar?), Loris Karius\u2019s error against Real Madrid and Gabriel Jesus dinking home to take City to the 100-point mark last season. But why the montage? Lineker explains how the Wild Boars, the Thai youth team that were trapped in a cave in the Chiang Rai province last summer. A few of them are in the building, and the NEC rises to its feet to applaud their bravery. Mo Farah, last year\u2019s winner, trudges out on to the stage with the trophy. How was it being Sports Personality of the Year, he\u2019s asked. \u201cAs an athlete you train your hardest, do what you can and it\u2019s nice to have that big bit of history,\u201d Farah says. He says it\u2019s great to be stood alongside other athletes, peering round at Harry Kane and co, adding: \u201cI\u2019ll be getting a selfie later\u201d. Ah, lovely stuff. Gary Lineker introduces himself, Clare Balding tells us \u201csport has that special power to bring us those euphoric highs and lows\u201d and Gabby Logan informs us there will be \u201claughter and tears\u201d. Are we ready for that? Anyway, here come the six official contenders for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award: \u2022 Harry Kane \u2022 Dina Asher-Smith \u2022 Lewis Hamilton \u2022 James Anderson \u2022 Lizzy Yarnold \u2022 Geraint Thomas So, how else to kick-off a memorable 12 months of sporting action than Paloma Faith doing a rendition of Aretha Franklin\u2019s R-E-S-P-E-C-T? Birmingham is, er, rocking. Just a little bit, just a little bit ... It is five minutes until the off in Birmingham, with Clare Balding, Gabby Logan and Gary Lineker, of course, helming the BBC\u2019s coverage. We\u2019re expecting plenty of love for England\u2019s road to the World Cup \u2013 and a memorable few weeks in Russia. Remember leafy Repino, and Harry Maguire on the unicorn? With Lizzy Yarnold in the mix for the top award, how about a trip down memory lane? For our very own Barry Glendenning, that is: Last year\u2019s winner, Mo Farah, is among those on the red carpet, posing for photos and stopping for a chat. But while we wait for the nominees for the big one, we already have a shortlist for the World Sport Star of the Year award: Ester Ledecka, Francesco Molinari, Oleksandr Usyk and Simone Biles. Tony Bellew described Usyk, the 31-year-old Ukrainian, as \u201cthe greatest fighter I have ever shared a ring with, you are a great champion, you beat me fair and square\u201d after a bout, in which the boxer retained his belts and reaffirmed his status as one of the best on the planet. The runners and riders for the main award have not been formally announced, but the bookies\u2019 favourites for the top gong are: \u2022 Harry Kane \u2022 Geraint Thomas \u2022 Lewis Hamilton \u2022 Tyson Fury \u2022 Dina Asher-Smith \u2022 Lizzy Yarnold \u2022 Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan \u2022 Alastair Cook Some essential, and fun, pre-awards reading: As the year draws to a close, the red carpet is out as we get ready to indulge in a brilliant 12 months of sport. England made great strides at the World Cup in Russia last summer, while there were British triumphs at the Tour de France and F1, courtesy of Geraint Thomas and Lewis Hamilton respectively. On top of that, there was the return of Tyson Fury and Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan doesn\u2019t need a major comeback, he just keeps on winning things. Unlike other years, the BBC have kept us all on tenterhooks for this 65th sports review, not revealing the nominations until this evening at the NEC, so there could be a few left-field contenders. Jimmy Anderson, Dina Asher-Smith and Lizzy Yarnold could also be in with a shout. Best of all, we\u2019re in for a real treat: The Lightning Seeds are doing a rendition of Three Lions, a nod to a special summer for England\u2019s football team. Meanwhile, one award we do already know the British racing driver Billy Monger has in the bag is the Helen Rollason award. The 19-year-old had both legs amputated following a crash during a Formula 4 race at Donington Park and returned to racing less than a year after the accident. The top five gongs at the up for grabs are: \u2022 Sports Personality of the Year \u2022 Greatest Sporting Moment \u2022 World Sports Star \u2022 Team of the Year \u2022 Coach of the Year"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
