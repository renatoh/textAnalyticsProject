Where once there had been quiet confidence, a private conviction that his side's drive and resilience would see them through, this morning there is only devastation. And a Uefa Cup place will be scant consolation. The Frenchman counts that competition, won in such scintillating fashion in Dortmund two years ago, as his greatest achievement since arriving on Merseyside. But slipping apologetically back into what has now become an also-ran trophy, four years to the day since he assumed sole charge, will leave him numb. \"In France maybe Europe means more than the domestic league,\" he had said after a spanking 3-1 win in Moscow last month appeared to have hoisted his side to within touching distance of the second phase. \"Most managers there would agree with that - in England most would say the Premiership is the priority and I think my players would share that opinion - but for me to win the Champions League is the ultimate goal. It's an ambition, it's a target. One day I think we will win it.\" This morning those lofty ambitions appear ridiculous. Economically Liverpool can write off \u00a310m with their failure to qualify, which means any potential spending spree in January may well have gone. That may, of course, have implications on their Premiership challenge though, more significantly as far as Houllier is concerned, his young side have been robbed of another opportunity to develop among the cream of the continent. Houllier, collar upturned and red scarf flapping, cut a forlorn figure as Basle ran riot in the first half. Christian Gimenez's second goal hardly registered, sheer shock etched across his face as he stared into the middle distance. The incredulous laughter among the home support, pinching themselves at the three-goal advantage as he trudged from the field at half-time, did nothing for his dismal mood. The spirited second-half revival merely papered over a few cracks. Quite how his Premiership leaders had been so systematically dismantled by the Swiss champions still seems inexplicable. After all, Liverpool had peppered Pascal Zuberb\u00fchler's goal with 28 attempts at Anfield last month, even if Basle had escaped with an unlikely point. For an hour of last night this was role reversal to an embarrassing extent and, though Liverpool's fightback was worthy in the extreme, they simply had too much to do. Houllier's dream, however unrealistic, lies in tatters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
