No sooner is he back than the shadow chancellor is under pressure for attending a party on a yacht that Mandelson also enjoyed. While everyone agrees Osborne did nothing wrong, it has been his judgment rather than Mandelson's that has been unflatteringly highlighted by the BBC and other parts of the media. My advice to Conservatives is to defend their man against this attack. They should say that if anyone should be moved for the visit to the yacht it should be Mandelson, as he was the one who held important office. Personally I don't think it was a resigning matter for either. The lack of balance in appraising the roles of each is something Conservatives should complain about. Others I read criticise Osborne for not attacking the government enough on their economic policy. I find this curious. If he were that easy an opponent to handle, Labour would not be so keen to get rid of him. He has made two important statements recently. His \"cupboard is bare\" speech highlighted the dangers of Labour's wasteful spending, entering recession with borrowing too high. His article on the levels of borrowing has sent a crucial warning to the government that there are limits to how much a state can borrow at sensible rates. This warning was echoed by the governor of the Bank of England yesterday. His record has included the very popular inheritance tax policy announced at party conference in 2007, his invention of the apt phrase \"tax con, not tax cut\" to describe the income tax changes that went wrong this summer, and his charge that the government did not mend the roof when the sun was shining. I look forward to him getting to grips with the profligacy shown towards the banks, as Labour seems keen to maximise the cost to the taxpayer of rescuing them. We all share the wish to help stabilise these large institutions, but some of us are very critical of the means. Labour's way means taxpayer money supporting armies of very highly paid people in receipt of big bonuses, and too little pressure on the capital-seeking banks to curb their costs. Lastly, George was right to oppose the nationalisation of Northern Rock, which is now in expensive run-off, shedding jobs and unable to offer new mortgages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
