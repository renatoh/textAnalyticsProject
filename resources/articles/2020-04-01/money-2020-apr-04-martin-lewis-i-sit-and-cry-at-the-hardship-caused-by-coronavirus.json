It is five years since he was given the label \u201cthe most trusted man in Britain\u201d after a pre-EU referendum poll found that 71% of people trusted him when he talked about Europe, putting him ahead of any other public figure. Now, alongside medical and scientific experts, he has again become the man many are turning to for reassurance in a time of crisis. A \u201cphenomenal\u201d number of people have sought his financial expertise through social media or his website, moneysavingexpert.com, over the past two weeks, he says. But being the man people look to for help is not always easy. \u201cWhen you watch the news, they\u2019re interested in telling you what\u2019s happening,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m interested in telling you what you should do. So when someone\u2019s desperate, and it\u2019s someone for whom I don\u2019t have an answer, that\u2019s when I get really upset. That\u2019s when I sit at my desk and I have a little cry. I find it really frustrating. I know I\u2019m meant to be the person who can answer questions \u2013 but sometimes there isn\u2019t an answer. And someone\u2019s pleading with me to help them.\u201d Isolated with his young family at his home in London, he has been clocking up 14-hour days to help workers who face poverty if they follow government advice and stay home. One heartbreaking plea came from a single mother whose employer insisted she continued with her non-essential job. She was caught between the impossible decision of not being able to afford to feed her children and taking them to work with her. \u201cThere are devastating holes in this system,\u201d says Lewis. He has been battling to convince ministers and civil servants to fill these holes by amending \u201comissions which are not deliberate\u201d, revising measures which have \u201cunintended consequences\u201d and making important \u201cclarifications\u201d about financial support packages on offer. Last week, for example, the government agreed to change its coronavirus job retention scheme guidance after campaigning by Lewis: firms can now rehire and furlough employees who left their job for a new job, which then fell through due to Covid-19. Lewis explains: \u201cI talk to the powers-that-be, in confidence, [and] I spoke to somebody significant, who I didn\u2019t really have a relationship with before this. I\u2019m trying to find answers. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m prioritising the bigger and more desperate needs in terms of getting information to try to help people. Many people are facing a destruction of income that is catastrophic for their financial and mental health.\u201d Despite spending his life fighting for consumers, often speaking in deliberately combative terms about \u201crip-off\u201d companies, he feels sympathetic to the plight of businesses hit hard by the lockdown. He is urging those who can afford it to accept vouchers instead of refunds for unusable tickets from airlines, theatres and festivals. \u201cWe want as few victims of coronavirus as possible, and that means, where we can, we need to show compassion and consideration \u2013 even to companies.\u201d Over the past fortnight, Lewis \u2013 who sold his website for more than \u00a380m in 2012 but remains editor-in-chief \u2013 has also set up his own fund for charities providing poverty relief during the outbreak. He has pledged \u00a31.9m of his estimated \u00a3128m fortune to the fund, and is calling for more rich donors to join him. \u201cI\u2019m talking to people in charities who are just desperate, saying we want to help people but all our fundraising streams have dried up.\u201d He hopes to keep workers in at least 400 charities in their jobs, as well as providing emergency funding to those most in need. But on a more emotional level, his donation \u201cwas partly to make myself feel better, if I\u2019m honest. Because I thought: I can\u2019t just sit here. I\u2019ve got to do something. I\u2019ve got to make sure, as best I can, that someone\u2019s going to give these people food.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
