Kean\u2019s intervention piles pressure on Scott Morrison to do more on emissions reduction and disaster management after his predecessor Malcolm Turnbull urged him to step up his government\u2019s response to the \u201cnational security issue\u201d and former emergency services chiefs pushed for a national summit. As Sydney suffered through air quality 11 times worse than hazardous levels on Tuesday, Kean told the Smart Energy Summit that weather conditions were \u201cexactly what the scientists have warned us would happen\u201d. \u201cLonger drier periods, resulting in more drought and bushfire,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this is not a catalyst for change, then I don\u2019t know what is. \u201cThis is not normal and doing nothing is not a solution. \u201cWe need to reduce our carbon emissions immediately, and we need to adapt our practices to deal with this kind of weather becoming the new normal.\u201d On Wednesday Kean told Radio National he would not \u201cwait till the end of summer to have a meaningful conversation\u201d about how to address the issue of climate change, which he said must be dealt with \u201cas a matter of science \u2026 not religion\u201d. Kean said he would announce a plan to increase the NSW government\u2019s emissions reduction targets, explaining it must \u201clisten to the scientists and the experts, coming up with a plan to make sure that NSW does its bit to reduce the impacts of climate change\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem. [The emergency] is not changing my view \u2013 before the bushfires my view was a very strong one and that is that we need to be doing our bit to protect our environment.\u201d Kean said addressing climate change was also \u201cabout growing our economy\u201d, citing the fact Australia\u2019s major export partners are moving to net zero emissions and exports of solar and wind power would \u201cunderwrite the prosperity of future generations\u201d. \u201cIt would be negligent to miss the opportunity to address climate change.\u201d On Tuesday Morrison rejected calls for more help for firefighters, including paying volunteers, telling reporters in Sydney that volunteers \u201cwant to be there\u201d. Morrison has accepted that climate change is making a \u201ccontribution \u2026 among many other issues\u201d to the severity and frequency of bushfires but played down the link by arguing Australia is powerless to \u201c[impact] directly on specific fire events\u201d because it causes 1.3% of global emissions. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, has said that only \u201cpure, enlightened and woke capital-city greenies\u201d link climate change with the current fire season. On Wednesday the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, told ABC News Breakfast that \u201cnobody is disputing the existence of climate change\u201d and the federal government accepted that \u201ctemperatures, dryness and all of these are clearly relevant factors\u201d to the bushfires. He said the federal government was \u201ccommitted to meeting global emissions reductions targets\u201d and contributed $15m a year to support aerial firefighting. In Madrid, Taylor has committed to the Paris agreement and flagged that the federal government will release a long-term strategy to reduce emissions next year, focusing on the deployment of \u201ccost-effective technologies\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
