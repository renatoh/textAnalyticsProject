Sir Patrick Gillam, chairman of the London-based emerging markets bank, insisted: \"We are independent and we intend to stay so.\" After the competition commission effectively blocked further big mergers of retail banks, Standard Chartered had been tipped as a target for one of the big players - particularly Barclays - looking for other ways to expand. Standard Chartered does not have a presence on the high street but its green and blue logo is a familiar sight across Asia. It is a leading mortgage lender in Hong Kong, where profit margins are depressed, and a large issuer of credit cards. The decision to list its shares in Hong Kong, the subject of persistent speculation, is not so much aimed at raising funds but more about widening its shareholder base beyond the City of London. Rana Talwar, the chief executive, said: \"This is not about raising new money because we need it. It's to demonstrate and reflect our role in Asia.\" American investors, the bank said, were interested in holding Hong Kong-listed companies. On the London market, Standard Chartered shares rose 26p to 836p after interim results soothed concerns about business. In the first six months of the year, Standard Chartered made $651m (\u00a3450m) after completing the two largest acquisitions in its history: of Grindlays, predominantly in India, and Chase's card business in Hong Kong. The bank is part way through cutting 6,200 jobs in an effort to reduce costs. Some 2,800 have already gone. Yesterday the bank tried to played down concerns about the impact of a continuing slowdown in the US economy on markets in Asia. There was some evidence of this in the interims as provisions made against bad debt rose 5% to $269m. Sir Patrick even hinted at a possible economic upturn by the end of the year. \"You shouldn't draw the conclusion that it's all doom and gloom,\" he said. \"We are not looking at a repetition of the 1997 Asian recession. \"We are cautiously optimistic about the second half. We don't see the world going into recession.\" Profits fell in Singapore and Malaysia, and the bank admitted that its recently acquired Thai business, Nakornthon, would not achieve breakeven as soon as hoped. Standard Chartered remains on the acquisition trail, particularly in Egypt where it admitted interest in bidding for Egyptian American Bank but failed to agreed on a price. Richard Coleman, banking analyst at ABN Amro, said that at present the bank had no need for extra capital but would in the future to fund acquisitions. Standard Chartered will pay a dividend of 12.82 cents, up 10%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
