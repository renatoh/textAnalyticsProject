Birx gave the warning in a written memo delivered to top administration officials Monday. It is a direct contradiction of one of Donald Trump\u2019s central, and false, closing campaign messages \u2013 that the US is \u201crounding the corner\u201d on the pandemic. \u201cWe are entering the most concerning and most deadly phase of this pandemic,\u201d Birx wrote in the memo, first reported by the Washington Post. She continued: \u201cCases are rapidly rising in nearly 30% of all USA counties, the highest number of county hotspots we have seen with this pandemic. Half of the United States is in the red or orange zone for cases despite flat or declining testing.\u201d The memo came as Trump gathered hundreds at in-person rallies in key swing states, and warned that his political rival Joe Biden would lock down the country again. \u201cThis is not about lockdowns \u2013 it hasn\u2019t been about lockdowns since March or April,\u201d Birx said. \u201cIt\u2019s about an aggressive, balanced approach that is not being implemented.\u201d Americans need \u201cconsistent messaging about uniform use of masks, physical distancing and hand washing, with profound limitation on indoor gatherings especially with family and friends,\u201d she wrote. News of the memo comes after Dr Anthony Fauci, considered the top infectious disease expert in the US, who is the leading public health official on the White House coronavirus taskforce, while Birx is the team\u2019s co-ordinator, warned the winter will bring \u201ca whole lot of hurt\u201d, if the US does not immediately change the pandemic\u2019s trajectory. The US set a world record for new cases over the weekend, with more than 100,000 new diagnoses in one day. Hospitalizations have increased alongside new infections. Deaths, considered a lagging indicator, also rose slightly. Deaths have not reached the heights seen last spring, when the virus overwhelmed hospital systems in the north-east and New York City in particular. But experts warned they could rise to those levels again, if hospital systems become overwhelmed and are unable to find the nursing staff needed to treat patients. Already, hospital systems are struggling to find nurses, training those with limited experience in working in field hospitals, and relying on traveling nurses to provide care. Experienced nurses are \u201cburned out with this whole (pandemic)\u201d and some are quitting, said Kevin Fitzpatrick, an emergency room nurse at Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Michigan. \u201cReplacing them is not easy,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, the nursing home industry where America\u2019s most medically vulnerable residents live, has warned cases are growing inside facilities and community spread will inevitably find its way inside facilities. Experts in personal protective equipment are also warning of shortages, including critically of nitrile gloves. Dr Shikha Gupta, executive director of the nonprofit Get Us PPE, warned: \u201cWe are deeply unprepared for what that\u2019s going to bring as hospitals reach capacity across the US with surging caseloads.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
