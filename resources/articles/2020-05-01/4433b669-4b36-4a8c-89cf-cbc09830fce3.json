Do something!': Coronation Street double acts reunited on Royal Mail stamps", "bodyText": "Famous double acts over six decades of ITV\u2019s Coronation Street are being reunited on a special-issue set of Royal Mail stamps to celebrate the programme\u2019s diamond anniversary. Eight stamps highlight the most memorable couples and adversaries to walk Weatherfield\u2019s cobbles since December 1960 on the world\u2019s longest-running soap. Each stamp features a one-line quote summing up the essence of their relationship on the show, which has run to more than 10,000 episodes. They include the judgmental widow and formidable gossip Ena Sharples, in trademark hairnet, pictured in confrontational pose with her nemesis Elsie Tanner, and the caption: \u201cThat woman\u2019s tongue. If it was a bit longer she could shave with it.\u201d On another stamp the hard-working cleaner Hilda Ogden, gazing upward from beneath curlers and headscarf, exclaims \u201cWoman, Stanley, Woman\u201d to her layabout husband Stan. The soap\u2019s equally enduring married couple Jack and Vera Duckworth are remembered with his endearment: \u201cVera, my little swamp duck.\u201d Ken and Deirdre Barlow\u2019s famously up-and-down relationship is summarised with the oft-repeated demand: \u201cKen! Do something!\u201d, while the newsagent Rita Tanner and her sidekick Norris Cole purse lips over a cuppa as they agree: \u201cI can\u2019t abide to see people gossiping.\u201d Hayley and Roy Cropper, Sunita and Dev Alahan, and Tracy and Steve McDonald also feature. Four further stamps, in a miniature sheet, celebrate those behind the pumps at the Rovers Return \u2013 Bet Lynch, Raquel Watts, Liz McDonald and Gemma Winter. The series producer, Iain MacLeod, said: \u201cIn our historic 60th year, it is an honour to have the show immortalised in this fashion.\u201d Royal Mail\u2019s stamp strategy manager, Philip Parker, said: \u201cFor six decades Coronation Street\u2019s fans have witnessed the unfolding lives of its residents, and shared their sorrows and laughter. We celebrate the nation\u2019s best-known street with stamps showing some of its unforgettable characters.\u201d The stamps go on general sale from 28 May."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
