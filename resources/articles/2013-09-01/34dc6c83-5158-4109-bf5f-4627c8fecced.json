On Monday it was revealed that it will be Urinetown that opens in the capital, a show that attracted something of a cult following more than a decade ago. Urinetown the Musical will run at the St James theatre next February telling the story of Caldwell B Cladwell who makes his fortune through bribery and the monopolisation of all public toilets. It is set in the future but it is very much a story for today, said its London director Jamie Lloyd. \"We're seeing around the world people discovering a voice, the voice of the underdog, the voice of people who have been repressed and oppressed shouting louder than ever before and that is exactly what happens in the show.\" It is also \"incredibly funny,\" he said. \"This is a show that I've wanted to do for many, many years. I saw it on Broadway in 2002 and I was struck by its unbelievable wit.\" The musical ran in New York from 2001 until 2004 and was nominated for 10 Tony awards, winning three."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
