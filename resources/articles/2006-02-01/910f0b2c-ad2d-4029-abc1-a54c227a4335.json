The roster of teachers changes regularly, but all are at the top of the profession and, across the year, offer everything from hatha to Scaravelli Yoga. Resorts such as Parrot Cay charge \u00a360 for a breathing class, but at Ulpotha, the price of \u00a3600 a week is all-in, covering teaching and accommodation, as well yogic essentials such as as massages, sarongs and vegan food. \u00b7 (0870 444 2702; www.ulpotha.com)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
