Senior managers at BBC South East, based in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, told the hearing that Mr Mayer, a former national newsreader for the BBC and Sky News, thought he was a \"cut above\" the station and was critical of its lighter news content. Mr Mayer, former spokesman for the Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed, claims he was sacked from his \u00a369,000-a-year post as chief presenter of South East Today because he exposed concerns over bullying of journalists at the studio. Mr Mayer, 57, says he was \"harassed\" out of his job after making several complaints to a senior manager, Laura Ellis, concerning the \"atmosphere of intimidation\" in the newsroom, about which he claims nothing was done. He is claiming that under \"whistle blowing\" legislation he suffered detrimental treatment because he highlighted the problems. But today Ms Ellis, head of regional programmes at BBC South East, told the tribunal in Ashford that a decision was made not to renew Mr Mayer's contract purely because he was not committed enough to regional news. She said: \"I had the impression he thought he was a cut above the programme he was doing. He was dismissive and patronising. He was status conscious.\" Ms Ellis recounted one occasion when Mr Mayer was asked, as part of a programme, to present a soft news item about a railway station cat. She claimed he was critical of the item and rewrote the introduction minutes before going on air. She said: \"He argued about it and then named the wrong railway station.\" Mr Mayer complained to Ms Ellis about another of the programme's managers, Davina Reynolds, who was at the centre of several allegations of bullying made by staff at the station. He also criticised her relationship with another senior manager, to whom she was engaged. Ms Ellis told how he asked her to sort out the problem. \"He was shouting at me, jabbing his finger. He was berating me generally.\" During 2002, Ms Ellis said she became increasingly concerned about Mr Mayer's attitude to regional news, particularly in the light of comments made by the public and senior BBC managers that the show was dull. It was decided, she told the tribunal, that the show would have two presenters, with Mr Mayer being named as the main presenter. Mr Mayer agreed but Ms Ellis continued to be concerned about his commitment to the show, and in mid 2002, he was advised by his agent that his contract would be terminated. Mr Mayer claims he was sacked after storming out of Ms Ellis's office in anger over the suggestion that falling viewing figures were partly his fault. He also claims he was dismissed for speaking out about Ms Reynolds's treatment of staff, which he made the focus of an article published in the Mail on Sunday in June last year about the Tunbridge Wells studios. But Ms Ellis told the hearing: \"I am categorically clear that the decision not to renew his contract was made for proper editorial reasons and was nothing to do with suggestions that he said that staff were being bullied.\" Earlier the hearing heard from other staff members who claimed they were bullied or intimidated by Ms Reynolds. Broadcast journalist Jennie Tait said: \"Laurie was very professional. He was elegant and crisp and I made a point of learning from him.\" Of the atmosphere in the office, Ms Tait said: \"I went home every night and cried to my husband. I went to Laura (Ellis) and begged her to do something about it.\" Robert Sharpe said that he left his post at Tunbridge Wells to work in London when his relationship with Ms Reynolds broke down. Mr Sharpe, now lead director of news in London, said he was shouted at by Ms Reynolds after a successful test of how the station would cope if there was a failure in equipment. He said: \"Everyone was congratulating me because the programme went so well, but Davina's reaction was completely explosive. I was in total shock. She was swearing, using the worst language. Everyone heard.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
