Through one of the 1950s Ellison red-iron turnstiles, it is the nostalgic story of \"over 100 years of dreams - some fulfilled, some not\", from tributes to Harry Goslin and the Wartime Wanderers to the stockings worn by Ted Vizard in a 6-0 trouncing of Blackburn in 1925 and the dinner menu after the 1958 FA Cup final. For the footballing sentimentalist - and there are many in Bolton - it is a misty-eyed trip down memory lane. But for Allardyce the priorities have shifted. Rather than living in the past, the emphasis is on building for the future. Tonight they visit Portsmouth, but many minds will already be turning towards the weekend and beyond. A neighbourly spat at home to Blackburn on Saturday will decide which of them reaches the FA Cup quarter-finals. The same all-Lancashire skirmish the following Friday could conceivably settle which side finishes behind Fulham in the First Division. \"This is what it's all about,\" Allardyce sighed yesterday. The old-timers at Bolton will fondly remember him as the old-fashioned, broken-nose epitome of the 70s centre-half. \"He was what I called a ball-playing defender,\" says Dave Bassett, a long-time friend. \"If he wasn't playing with the ball he was playing with your balls.\" Yet beneath the thick-set, gravel-voiced exterior and the fondness for a pint of Boddingtons, this moustachioed 46-year-old is becoming recognised as one of the most enterprising managers in the game: an alumnus of football's old school in many respects yet also a student of the appliance of science. \"I got into sports science when I was playing for Tampa Bay and I've used it ever since,\" he says. \"In those days people in England used to treat cramp with salt tablets whereas in America they would have laughed at things like that. Over there it was all about potassium, electrolytes and replacement fluids. \"I brought that back with me and now I have a fitness coach who was educated in America and goes back there every year to update himself on the latest scientific techniques.\" The new regime means his players are not allowed even a half-time cup of tea because, according to the boffins, it can reduce fluid levels and increase muscle fatigue. Yet the dietetics would be irrelevant if Allardyce had not assembled a talented and willing squad on a budget not wholly dissimilar to his early days at Limerick when his duties regularly included organising a club collection. Financial restraints have compelled him to grub around at the fag-end of the transfer market but the 34-year-old free transfer Ian Marshall has been a revelation, Colin Hendry has shored up the defence while on loan from Coventry and Nicky Summerbee has swiftly acclimatised since joining from Sunderland. Then there is Michael Ricketts, a 22-year-old Brummie with 17 goals since signing from Walsall for \u00a3250,000. \"He's got all the same qualities as Emile Heskey and he's actually a better natural finisher; \u00a37m would be peanuts for him now,\" eulogises Allardyce. \"If he gives it more time he should be looking to play for England.\" There is a case that Bolton's abysmal semi-final against Aston Villa last season, and specifically the sight of Dean Holdsworth wafting the ball over an open Wembley goal, detracted from the club having reached such a lofty perch. Losing one semi-final is unfortunate; losing three can be construed as careless. Yet Bolton also came off second best to Tranmere in the Wor thington Cup and, most excruciatingly, Ipswich in the play-offs. Allardyce promptly took off on a two-week cruise minus his mobile phone. \"I wanted to get away,\" he says, but now he and Bolton are very much back in the groove. A renaissance is taking shape and the policeman's son from Dudley has a new 10-year contract. \"By signing a long-term deal I've got the right amount of time now to do the job properly. The infrastructure is not totally in place yet but when we do get into the Premiership I want us in a position where we can sustain our position rather than being this yo-yo club of the last 40 years. \"The facilities at this club are second to none and you can't help feel there is a real buzz about the place.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
