In those more innocent days the stocky teenager was simply thrilled to be on his way down to London with the white rose of Yorkshire on his puffed-up chest. \"I remember it clear as a bell,\" says the 36-year-old who, in county cricket's most evocative story of a new season, has returned to Yorkshire as captain and fully fledged dancing celebrity after three years away. \"We took the train to London to play Middlesex with a team of Yorkshiremen - Martyn Moxon, Jim Love, David Bairstow, Phil Carrick, Chris Pickles, Arnie Sidebottom and the rest. I took five wickets at Lord's and even got Gatt [Mike Gatting] out. I bowled 13 overs on the trot and got a stress fracture in my back. It was something new then, a stress fracture, but everyone gets them now. It's the fashion - and maybe another one I started.\" As a big-bottomed tub-thumper and drinking partner to both Ian Botham and Andrew Flintoff, and a man as happy talking Yorkshire cricket with Geoff Boycott as he is leading Kevin Pietersen into a tattoo parlour, Gough is one of the last remaining links between different eras of the game. Next week, while completing the full circle of his journey through English cricket, Gough will travel down to London for his first match as Yorkshire captain - but this time to The Oval, to face Surrey, where he will face Mark Ramprakash, his successor as Strictly Come Dancing champion. Gough might not mind that he is now recognised more often for his tangos and twirls than the 229 wickets he took in 58 Tests, but he makes a telling point about his old-fashioned passion for cricket. \"I've been amazed,\" he says as he taps the flower on his shirt, \"that the young players here know all about my dancing career but they didn't know how many petals there are in the Yorkshire rose. It's the first thing Phil Carrick taught me. There are 11 with a red one in the middle for the captain and I'm chuffed that's me. My team know all about the petals now and it's another big turning point. \"In a weird way it reminds me of when I was 21 and seriously thinking of jacking it all in - until I spent a winter as a labourer on the motorways. The M62, mate, in the freezing cold, from 6.30 every morning. I liked getting fit but it also made me think 'Do I want to do this the rest of my life?' I came back to Yorkshire and Richie Richardson [at Headingley from 1993-94] told me to concentrate on bowling fast. I stepped up a yard and my life changed. I've not felt that same excitement about county cricket until now.\" A few months ago Gough was again on the brink of \"jacking it all in\" - this time for the black hole of celebrity television rather than the black tar of motorway maintenance. \"Essex offered me a two-year deal to stay but I'd not signed it because I had lots of TV and radio opportunities to consider. But when Yorkshire kept pursuing me with the captaincy I finally gave in the third time they asked. I love being back now.\" On a gorgeous spring day at Headingley, Gough's conviction is striking. But some wounds have festered for years. When Gough left Yorkshire in 2004 his marital problems and desire to see more of his two sons in Buckinghamshire obscured his rift with key figures like David Byas, then his captain. In his absence the mood soured still further, with yet more players leaving or threatening legal action to escape their contracts. \"This club, for a long time, was empty of enjoyment but the mood has changed in the last few weeks. I know people will laugh at the idea of me being captain but my way is to bring back some fun and treat each player as an adult. I want my players to enjoy themselves and there are no real rules - even if I can already tell which of 'em will need the occasional bollocking.\" Gough praises Nasser Hussain among his former captains, but stresses that \"Stephen Fleming is the best leader in world cricket. I played at Yorkshire with him and he is an absolute magician. But I've learnt a hell of a lot about the game and I've got massive respect from my team, because they know I'll run through brick walls for Yorkshire\". Fleming would never spout such bluster himself, but Yorkshire is certainly a cheerier place in pre-season. Gough is full of his usual ebullience after a winter in which his international career finally faded away. His anger towards England's selectors soon emerges. \"All I've ever wanted is honesty from them and I'm still waiting. I know the truth but it's been hidden this winter. I'm really disappointed in the way I've been treated by England. They picked me again last summer when I hadn't played for Essex for weeks because of injury. I wasn't fit but they said if I didn't play they couldn't consider me for the ICC Trophy; so I played but no way was I fit and I pulled out after two games. \"But they did so badly in Australia they asked me to go for a medical - which I passed. But for some reason it was said I'd failed. A week later [chairman of selectors] David Graveney apologised and said I didn't fail. I couldn't get my head round it. I was out the party of 30 for World Cup selection and then they tell me they might want to pick me again. But I learnt from the TV that I hadn't been chosen after all. Apart from not telling me, Graveney then denied we'd even had that conversation. After 159 internationals for England I deserved some honest communication.\" That curiously shifty and muddled thinking surrounding an ageing bowler symbolises England's mediocre World Cup campaign. Gough argues with typical defiance that \"I could've done a decent job for England. We might have some terrific young bowlers but I'm not sure they were ready for this tournament\". Yet the familiar lament of failure has less to do with Gough's absence than a glaring lack of clarity and dynamism in both selection and tactical thinking. If Gough supported their choice of Flintoff as captain for a woeful Ashes defence, he castigates the selectors' reaction to his friend's dunk off a pedalo. \"I'm really disappointed they took the vice-captaincy off Freddie. It was for totally the wrong reason and too much. I'm not sure where England are going now.\" Gough laughs at the suggestion that he and Flintoff must have got Freddied together more times than he can remember. \"We've had lots of great nights getting hammered because he's a good man, a quality man. The one that sticks in my head is that Test in South Africa [in January 2000]. The night before the last day everyone was in the bar with Woosie [Ian Woosnam] and Lee Westwood. It had rained for three days solid and we thought there was no chance of play. So we got stuck in with Woosie and drank until half-past-three. \"By the time we got to the ground they were using two bleeding helicopters to dry a sodden outfield. I'd been sick twice but Nasser made me bowl 10 overs on the bounce, just to teach me a lesson. And then we got this message that Hansie Cronje wanted to offer us a run-chase - that was the game they said he fixed. Nasser made me sit in my pads all afternoon but I eventually went in at 10 and hit the winning runs in the last over. We thought it was odd at the time but I was so hungover I didn't know what was going on.\" South Africa were then coached by Bob Woolmer, whose murder last month shook Gough \"to the core. I'm still in shock and if there's match-fixing involved they should get everyone. But it's hard to know what's going on. Vaughany says it's rife but how does he know? I've certainly never been approached and I'm disappointed, in a way. I might've shopped them - but you wouldn't shop them now, would you? You could end up dead\". After murder and match-fixing the tangled battles of Yorkshire cricket seem as innocent as that rickety train journey Gough made for his first-class debut 18 years ago. \"But if I was trying to explain Yorkshire cricket to an alien he would have more chance of understanding it than a normal human being,\" Gough chortles. \"Yorkshire cricket is very passionate and packed full of tradition; we just need to take out the stubbornness. And I'm as Yorkshire-stubborn as they come. My dad's even worse. If it was down to him he would take every single holiday in Yorkshire. He's Yorkshire-mad.\" Gough is \"back happily with my family again\" and will shuttle between Leeds and Milton Keynes, where his sons and former wife, Anna, still live. \"They've got Buckinghamshire accents, my boys,\" he says with wide-eyed incredulity, \"but, like my dad, they're dead chuffed for me. They know I've come home.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
