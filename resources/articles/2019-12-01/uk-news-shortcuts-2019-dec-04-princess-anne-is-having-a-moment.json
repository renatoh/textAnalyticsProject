Age: 69. Appearance: Tireless, stalwart, cross. AKA: Anne, Princess Royal, KG, KT, GCVO, GCStJ, QSO, CD. Is there a cat walking across your keyboard? That is just her full array of orders and decorations, abbreviated. She is the Queen\u2019s second child and the 14th in line to the British throne. But who is she, really? Besides the Queen, she is currently everyone\u2019s favourite royal. More popular than Prince Andrew? By an ever-widening gulf. When did this happen? It is partly to do with actor Erin Doherty\u2019s standout portrayal of the young Anne in series three of The Crown. She comes across well, then? \u201cThe most thrifty, feet-on-the-ground, low-profile, unpretentious royal we\u2019ve got,\u201d says Prince Philip in episode four. That really doesn\u2019t sound like something he would say. Rest assured: he almost certainly never did. Exactly. This is all fiction. But the real Princess Anne has also emerged as an unlikely hero during Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Britain, thanks to a video clip. Video, you say? In it, she is part of a conversation in which several world leaders seem to be sharing a laugh at Trump\u2019s boorish indiscipline. At last, something that can unite a divided world: snobbery. Anne remains the hardest-working, most down-to-earth Windsor. Neither of her husbands accepted peerages and her children do not have titles. She consistently undertakes more royal engagements than the other royals. Including the Queen? Yes. Anne is involved with more than 200 charities and organisations. And she likes horses. She does indeed; to the extent that she made the British Olympic eventing team, competing in the Montreal games in 1976. She was definitely the first royal to win BBC Sports Personality of the Year, a feat repeated by her daughter Zara in 2006. Actually, she does sound rather super. She also survived a harrowing kidnapping attempt in 1974, when an assailant shot four people and ordered her from her limousine. What did she do? She said: \u201cI haven\u2019t got \u00a32m\u201d and got out of the other side. I think I want to hang out with her. She\u2019s so refreshingly blunt! She doesn\u2019t suffer fools gladly, that\u2019s for sure. OK, forget it then. It\u2019s probably for the best. Do say: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t her, Donald! Someone else shouted: \u2018Moron!\u2019\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cCareful, Ma\u2019am: if the wind changes, your expression might stay that way.\u201d This article was amended on 5 December 2019 to take into account Zara Phillips also winning the BBC Sports Personality of the Year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
