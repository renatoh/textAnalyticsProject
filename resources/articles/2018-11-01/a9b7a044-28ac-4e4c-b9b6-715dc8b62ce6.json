It was an imperious performance and another attacking masterclass with Norwich flaunting their firepower by running in four goals for a third consecutive game. Three goals in a 21-minute burst overwhelmed Swansea before Daniel James pulled a goal back but Teemu Pukki scored his 10th of the season after the break to put the gloss on a superb display and curb optimism in south Wales. Farke, the Norwich manager, had warned his players, fresh from a warm-weather training camp in Florida to avoid any complacency. He admitted his team started slowly before striding away. The classy Emil Buend\u00eda rolled home his side\u2019s second after a Mike van der Hoorn own goal. Marco Stiepermann then poked in at the back post after fine work by the 18-year-old Max Aarons. Hull, Rotherham and Bolton, three teams battling relegation, face the unenviable task of shackling Norwich next and the scary thing is the leaders were in second gear for large periods. \u201cWe are enjoying that we are flying at the moment. We want to go further on but there is not so much pressure on us compared with the big-spenders in the league, who perhaps have that pressure of needing to get promoted,\u201d Farke said. \u201a \u201cWe are in good shape but greedy to get more points. To be in this position is outstanding, it\u2019s no coincidence, one third of the season is done and we have won many points but we know each good result is based on hard work. We are pretty focused, disciplined, pretty concentrated and this is key for us on this run.\u201d For a young Swansea side, this proved a jarring reminder they are very much a work in progress. Less than a minute after Bersant Celina wrapped a free-kick round a six-man wall and Leroy Fer drove over the rebound, Norwich had the ball in Erwin Mulder\u2019s net. They flew upfield, Stiepermann nudging the ball into the path of Pukki, who unselfishly decided against taking aim. His pass caused havoc; Van der Hoorn\u2019s desperate attempt to cut the ball out ended up with his studs in Mulder\u2019s midriff and Pukki revelling in his misfortune as he wheeled away in celebration. Things quickly went from bad to worse. Buend\u00eda reacted quickest when Mulder played a poor pass to Celina on the edge of the box. Buend\u00eda, a \u00a31.5m summer signing from Getafe, stole possession and, with Swansea still shuffling into position, the midfielder calmly finished. By the time Stiepermann got in on the act, walking the ball in at the back post, it felt like a damage limitation exercise for the hosts. The game should have been over but an error by Tim Krul gifted Swansea a lifeline before the break, with James tucking home after the Norwich goalkeeper spilled Kyle Naughton\u2019s piledriver. Farke was furious but not for long. Norwich soon found a fourth, when Buend\u00eda sprayed an exquisite ball out wide to Onel Hern\u00e1ndez who wrung Connor Roberts, the Swansea midfielder, inside out before feeding Pukki inside the box. The Finland striker spun away from a touch-tight Joe Rodon, controlling the ball with his left foot before applying a cute finish with his right. \u201cTo improve you have to have a bit of suffering and setback, and it\u2019s about how we respond as a team,\u201d Graham Potter, the Swansea manager, said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
