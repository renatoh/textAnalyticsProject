At the Etihad Campus on Monday Van Dijk was asked whether the fit\u2011again Sergio Ag\u00fcero could cause Liverpool more problems than Gabriel Jesus. \u201cIf we defend the way we did the other night against them, it does not matter who plays as a striker,\u201d came the reply. City require something special to ruffle this Liverpool defence. Liverpool, said Van Dijk, are \u201cthe perfect fit\u201d for the centre-half who ignored interest from their Champions League opponents on Tuesday and Chelsea to move to Anfield for \u00a375m in January. \u201cI love the club already,\u201d the Netherlands international said. In J\u00fcrgen Klopp he has found \u201cthe complete manager\u201d and in his new team\u2011mates the 26-year-old has absolute faith that his pursuit of silverware will be satisfied. That quest continues at the Etihad Stadium, where Klopp\u2019s team take a 3-0 lead into the quarter-final second leg. Any Liverpool fan fretting that this may not be enough against Pep Guardiola\u2019s prolific yet vulnerable team would have nerves soothed, massaged and oiled by a few minutes in Van Dijk\u2019s company. \u201cI\u2019m never nervous,\u201d the Liverpool defender said of the return against City. \u201cI am just excited. I think: \u2018Look where I am, playing for the semi-finals of the Champions League with my team. Just enjoy it and love it,\u2019 We are 3-0 up in a massive game, our fans are going to be ready and it is a great place to play. It is a fantastic opportunity. \u201cI always have been calm, sometimes a little too much. Sometimes that cost me back in the day, to be fair. What we do as players is something you need to enjoy. If everything goes well, I will play until I\u2019m 36 or 37 hopefully and then football is over, so just enjoy it. That is why I started to play football and why I wanted to do it day in, day out. Sometimes you lose but, if you win, the feeling is amazing.\u201d Van Dijk had that winning feeling after only 20 minutes of the first leg at Anfield last week, when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain swept Liverpool\u2019s second goal beyond Ederson and into the Kop net. He admits: \u201cAt 2-0 I had that feeling a bit, with the fans and the way we played. I felt we would keep pushing and pushing and then when you score the third before half-time it is a bit strange sitting in the dressing room 3-0 up against City. \u201cThey have not been 3-0 down at all this season but we still had to get ready for the second half and for the game here. At 2-0 there was a feeling we were doing something special and we need to keep going.\u201dHopefully we will be celebrating again after this game. The Dutch defender\u2019s contentment and confidence in Liverpool is reciprocated. Klopp\u2019s team have kept seven clean sheets in the 13 games that Van Dijk has played for the club \u2013 two in the two Champions League ties he has started so far \u2013 and they denied City, the highest scoring side in the Premier League, a single shot on target at Anfield last week. \u201cI don\u2019t take credit on my own for that,\u201d Van Dijk says of his impact. \u201cIt is the whole way we defend. If you look closely at what the three up front do collectively and then the guys behind, it makes it so much easier for us. Then obviously there is Loris [Karius] as the last line. The guys up front put the work in which is magnificent. \u201cOverall, the left-back, right-back, centre-backs, Loris, midfielders and forwards are putting in the work, and then on the training field with the manager. Everyone around us is fantastic and should be proud of how we defend and how many goals we have scored. Without the help of everyone else Mo [Salah] would not have so many goals. Everyone is doing their bit.\u201d Van Dijk insists on collective credit for Liverpool\u2019s defensive improvement but admits he relishes the responsibility of being the man whom team-mates and fans will turn to should Ag\u00fcero, Jesus or another City player open the scoring at the Etihad Stadium. \u201cI like pressure anyway,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou want the challenge and to have every day that feeling you need to push yourself, otherwise it becomes a little bit boring. I think with Liverpool every day is a challenge in training. You are playing against one of the best strikers in Europe. \u201cI am enjoying every bit of it. It makes me keep going and will make me better every day. I want to sit down when I am retired and think I did everything possible to get the best out of myself, not to be thinking: \u2018I should have done that or worked a little bit harder.\u2019 I think everything is possible.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
