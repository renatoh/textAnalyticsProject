Leading the list of call-offs were the Old Firm with Rangers' romantic game against Berwick Rangers at Shielfield Park a mid-afternoon casualty to leave officials of the local club among the most most miserable men in Scotland. The \"wee Rangers\" had been looking forward to a money-spinning afternoon with the guarantee of a 4,131 full house and the added cash rewards from television who were due to show the match live. Now their secretary Dennis McCleary is hoping Sky fulfil their desire to cover the tie on the rescheduled date of January 15. A morose McCleary, whose club spent several thousand pounds on a hot-air balloon in an atempt to save the day, admitted: \"It would have been a huge day for the club and the town and we are all very disappointed. Now, from a financial point of view, we're hoping the television company stick with it for the next time.\" Meanwhile, Celtic's game against Alloa Athletic at Falkirk's ground has been rescheduled for Tuesday. It was always a forlorn hope that that match would go ahead given the state of the Brockville pitch and despite the best efforts of groundstaff up and down the country the ties between Albion Rovers and Livingston, Clyde and St Mirren, Gala Fairydean and Forfar, Hamilton and Raith Rovers and East Fife and Partick Thistle were postponed and it is hoped they too will be played this midweek. Remarkably, a number of games remained intact and the picks of the day now are the all-Premier League meetings between St Johnstone and Aberdeen and Dunfermline and Motherwell. Elsewhere, there is limited potential for a spot of giant-killing which is never quite as frequent north of the border as it is in the FA Cup. The Second Division's Stranraer is probably not where the new Hibernian manager Franck Sauz\u00e9e, still without a victory since his appointment three weeks ago, would want to be on a cold January afternoon. He and the capital club are undoubtedly potential victims and Kilmarnock, who entertain Airdrie, are under some threat as well. Hearts and Dundee United should be too powerful at home to Ross County and Highland League Forres Mechanics although the latter's northern rivals Deveronvale will be relishing the visit of Ayr United whose inconsistent form has blighted their First Division season to date. Arbroath against Inverness Caley Thistle completes the picture with Dundee entertaining Falkirk tomorrow . \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
