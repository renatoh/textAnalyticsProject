Elsewhere the side is much as expected: David James get the nod over David Seaman in goal, while Sol Campbell and Rio Ferdinand will be the centre-back pairing in defence. In midfield, Nicky Butt, alongside his Manchester United team-mates David Beckham and Paul Scholes, gets his chance to impress in the absence of Steven Gerrard while Nicky Barmby will play on the left. Full team: David James (Aston Villa); Phil Neville (Manchester United), Sol Campbell (Tottenham Hotspur), Rio Ferdinand (Leeds United), Chris Powell (Charlton Athletic); Nicky Barmby (Liverpool), Nicky Butt (Manchester United), Paul Scholes (Manchester United) David Beckham (captain), (Manchester United); Andy Cole (Manchester United), Michael Owen (Liverpool)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
