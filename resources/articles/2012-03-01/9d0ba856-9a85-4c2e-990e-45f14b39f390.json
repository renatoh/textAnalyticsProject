Two years ago she gave a solo show on Ipanema Beach in Rio de Janeiro, and she now follows up with a solo album on which she is accompanied only by her own guitar. It's a varied, intimate set that provides a reminder of both her vocal range and her equally fine instrumental skill; she doesn't need a band to sing samba. She has a distinctive, fresh, no-nonsense style, mixing an easy, almost conversational approach with the ability to ease from complex and rhythmic scat jazz pieces to cool ballads, from vintage samba and classics by Tom Jobim, Caetano Veloso or Carlos Lyra and Vinicius De Moraes to her own songs, which include the charming and thoughtful Puro Ouro and the cheerful, English-language See You in Rio. A gently classic tribute to her home city."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
