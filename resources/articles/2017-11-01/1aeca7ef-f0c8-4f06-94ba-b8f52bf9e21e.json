Sixth form pupils at the Simon Langton grammar school for boys in Canterbury will take part in a forum which is described as \u201can antidote to the poison of political correctness\u201d and examine \u201cthe most beautifully disturbed and disturbing ideas, all of them presented without trigger warnings\u201d. The school\u2019s headteacher, Matthew Baxter, said that the forum would not involve the study of Mein Kampf but simply incorporate it in \u201cwider debate\u201d. But the optional classes for 17- and 18-year-old pupils were criticised by some students, who were told about the plans on Monday. The scheme\u2019s name appears to be a play on the phrase \u201csafe space\u201d \u2013 a zone in which a person or category of people can feel confident that they will not be exposed to discrimination, criticism, harassment, or any other emotional or physical harm. Two pupils said that the teacher in charge, Professor James S, had joked about LGBT groups by presenting the term with a string of random letters and numbers appended to it. The school has also scheduled lectures on the subjects \u201cWomen versus feminism\u201d and \u201cnot all cultures are created equal\u201d. James S, director of humanities at the school \u2013 which is mixed in the sixth form \u2013 told pupils that the first session would be devoted to a controversial memo circulated by the fired Google employee James Damore that claimed that women were innately less capable as engineers. James S defended it as a \u201cmuch-needed forum for debate\u201d. But Sarah Cundy, 18, said: \u201cWhen [James S] was talking about doing this, he said we\u2019ll look at the memo and highlight the pros and cons of his argument. To hear a teacher say there are any pros at all in the argument did make me feel pretty uncomfortable. \u201cI think female and minority students are going to face more issues. I think there will be a rise in sexism, which I would say is already an issue at the school \u2013 especially with it being an all-boys school except sixth form.\u201d Connie Kissock, also 18, agreed, saying: \u201cAs a female student, when I hear male teachers promoting anti-feminist ideas it makes me worry, particularly in an all-male environment. Especially among younger students, it can seem like a joke but end up being taken further.\u201d She explained that while she \u201cdefinitely support[s] discussing a broad range of ideas in academic environments\u201d she believes the speaker events organised by James S have \u201cbecome an attack on what they see as leftist bias. We\u2019ve had a speaker on women\u2019s antifeminism, we\u2019re going to have one on why all cultures aren\u2019t equal, implying that non-Western cultures are inferior\u201d. Students said that a PowerPoint presentation given by James S. on Monday included \u201ca joke at the expense of the LGBT community\u201d. Alice Lefever, 18, explained: \u201cLGBT was mentioned in the PowerPoint, followed by a string of letters and numbers, none of which were intended to give representation, but instead to mock.\u201d Last year, the school was criticised for inviting Yiannopoulos, a former pupil, to speak. The event, which was also organised by James S, was cancelled because of \u201cthe threat of demonstrations at the school by organised groups and members of the public\u201d. James S told the Guardian: \u201cThe Unsafe Space is a much-needed forum for debate about a host of issues seen from both sides of the ideological spectrum. We are not interested in fomenting xenophobia, racism or sexism. We are interested in evaluating arguments, not putting stilts under postures.\u201d The school librarian, Janeen Barker, said she helped him put together the PowerPoint presentation and said the LGBT acronym was a real one and not a joke. She said: \u201cI wanted to be as inclusive as possible by trying to use an LGBT-friendly term. I found the acronym LGBTQQIP2SAA on the following websites, both of which I thought were respectful of the community, as am I.\u201d Headteacher Matthew Baxter said the course was designed to enable pupils preparing for university to discuss ideas outside of the conventional curriculum. He said: \u201cThese are topics which sixth form students routinely discuss in their own time and ones which they should be able to discuss with adults in a school which encourages \u2018free speech\u2019 in all the highest academic traditions of such a phrase. \u201cThis does not mean that inappropriate language is permitted \u2013 as this is checked and modelled when students are much younger.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 February 2019 to remove some personal information."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
