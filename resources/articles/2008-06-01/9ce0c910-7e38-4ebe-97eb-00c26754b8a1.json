It was the first time I'd been to Australia. I was touring a one-man show by Justin Butcher, Scaramouche Jones. On opening night, some guy - a nutter I thought - thrust a script into my hand. It's the last thing you want at a time when you need to focus and concentrate, but I was polite and promised to read it. And then the man said, in a very broad Liverpool accent, \"You might remember me ... Bill Johnson. 1958. Blythe Hall. Ormskirk,\" and he turned and walked away. Seconds later it hit me like a thunderbolt. It was Bill. We'd been seminarians together, training to be Catholic priests at St Gabriel's College, Blythe Hall. I'd left and followed my career on the stage. Bill, too, had left eventually and come to Australia. The next day, I went to meet him and his wife, Pauline. I thought we'd talk about the old days - Blythe Hall, Liverpool Football Club, and so on - but then I was hit by the second thunderbolt. Bill and Pauline had adopted three children. The eldest, Louis St John (named after the Liverpool footballer) was an Aboriginal child, taken from his birth family in Alice Springs by the Australian government as part of what is now called the \"Stolen Generation\" removal programme. On his 19th birthday, in 1992, he was murdered by two white men. When asked by the police why they did it, the guys said: \"Because he was black.\" The two had only recently emigrated from England. They beat him up, and then ran over him. When an ambulance arrived, their assessment was he didn't require hospital treatment. He was taken home and - with a shattered pelvis - made to walk into his house and up the stairs to bed \"to sleep it off\". He also had a perforated bladder, perforated bowel, broken ribs and a punctured lung. The ambulance crew didn't even take his pulse. Two hours later, Louis was dead. Bill and Pauline took Louis's body back to Alice Springs, where he was buried alongside his ancestors, and Bill vowed that his son would not be forgotten. A trust was set up in Louis's name, and they approached Aboriginal singer-songwriter Archie Roach and asked him to write a song for Louis. It was over 10 years later that I entered the story and met Archie at Bill and Pauline's house. Like him, I was deeply shocked by the tragedy that had befallen this family. I didn't understand the situation, politically or spiritually. Bill suggested I make a journey round Australia visiting sites of political and historical interest to the Aboriginal people, to tell Louis's story and film what we found. The trust had a fund which could finance the trip. And if you're going to go round Aboriginal Australia, then who better to travel with than an Aboriginal singer-songwriter? Archie and I hit it off immediately; he was absolutely game to join me. The result was the documentary Liyarn Ngarn. Archie, a \"stolen child\" himself, is one of the finest artists of his generation, and a guiding light for the indigenous struggle for recognition and reconciliation. He's been called the Aboriginal William Blake. Check out his early albums Charcoal Lane and Looking for Butterboy. His new album, Journey, is based on the trip we took together. His music sticks in the soul. It gets deep inside you. These songs are a reaffirmation of identity, country, beliefs and spirit, and as Archie himself says, \"they're about how no one listened to our recommendations on stolen kids or people dying in jails. And so it continues ... but we are still watching and constantly taking note.\" Normally in my working life I deal with unreality, but this struggle is actually happening. We were taken away - just like the \"stolen generation\" - into a landscape that was exotic, alien, startlingly beautiful, sometimes harsh and uncompromising but always challenging, provocative and inspiring. Music was the lifebelt we took with us wherever we travelled. Through Archie I met many other musicians who unconsciously but collectively have become the new musical voice of native Australian culture. The country's former prime minister, John Howard, said infamously that Australians should not be forced to wear the \"black armband of history\" as a mark of their guilt over the treatment of Aborigines. Well, hey, here we are. The Black Arm Band - which features Archie and a variety of other indigenous artists - is coming to the UK as part of the London International Festival of Theatre, and I am thrilled that recognition of great music goes beyond political divisions to reach an audience who may not be as easily hoodwinked as the Stolen Generation. Their music, the sound, the influences and the long history they retell in a special and startling way still leave me reeling. Archie can sing Jambo Dreamin', a song about his grandpa, and you would swear he had a didgeridoo accompaniment - he doesn't. It's in his voice and in his soul, as indeed, his grandpa is. I witnessed the birth of these latest song stories and sometimes the process was harsh and painful. But when Archie hit the musical nail on the head and the song was complete, he would laugh outrageously and contagiously, tears rolling down his beautiful face. He doesn't sing protest songs. He's a wandering troubadour, picking up things as he goes along. Sometimes he sounds like someone from New Orleans, other times he's like an early soul singer, or Bob Dylan. He can sing simple words but gives them incredible meaning. His appeal is across the divide. This is not a white problem, it's not a black problem - it's an Australian problem. Don't come expecting didgeridoos. This is not Rolf Harris. It's modern, available, present music, but its roots and its history are to do with the whole indigenous struggle over the last 200 years. I defy anybody to listen to Archie Roach and not be moved. I'm reminded of what Ken Kesey once said: \"It's only true if it makes you laugh; if it makes you cry, it means you've understood it.\" \u00b7 The Black Arm Band perform at the Royal Festival Hall, London on June 26. Liyarn Ngarn will be screened the same evening. Box office: 0871-663 2500."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
