Playing Norway in a knockout game is special for us and I\u2019m just excited to be going to Lyon now.\u201d \u201cWe expected nothing else, really,\u201d says England\u2019s manager in an interview with the BBC upon being asked for his thoughts on England\u2019s emphatic win. \u201cThat\u2019s not me being arrogant. We\u2019re having the time of our lives \u2013 look at the spirit of the team. I thought it should have been four or five, to be honest, although Steph\u2019s clearance off the line was great.\u201d Asked about the performance of Lucy Bronze, he is full of praise. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen tonight that Lucy Bronze is the best player in the world, without a shadow of a doubt,\u201d he says. \u201cI played full-back, but not to that level. She\u2019s the best player in the world.\u201d Quizzed on who he\u2019d like as England\u2019s semi-final opponents, he says he doesn\u2019t care. \u201cWell, you know what - we want to play them both,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not bothered who we play. We\u2019ll go to Lyon and the atmosphere and the occasion will be great. We\u2019re having fun.\u201d England\u2019s improvement continues: This was an excellent performance from England, if you\u2019re prepared to look past that second-half wobble. They were rampant almost throughout and were well worth their win. Jill Scott, Ellen White and Lucy Bronze got the goals which booked their team\u2019s place in the last four of the tournament. Norway have been outclassed tonight, but will feel they should at least have got on the scoresheet. They were presented with several good chances through the misguided benevolence of England\u2019s defenders. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over and England are through to the Women\u2019s World Cup semi-final. They\u2019ll play the USA or France in Lyon next Tuesday after scoring three without reply against Norway. They\u2019ve been excellent tonight, save for one seven or eight-minute period in which they completely lost focus halfway through the second half. 90+4 min: There\u2019s a break in play as Vilde Risa gets treatment for an injury, possibly cramp. 90+3 min: Thorisdottir is on hand to intercept a Daly cross into the Norway box. 90+2 min: Rachel Daly picks out Beth Mead at the far post with a cross, but she\u2019s unable to convert from a very tight angle. All three England substitutes have looked very lively indeed since coming on, a testament to the squad\u2019s strength in depth. 90 min: England go in search of a fourth, with Georgia Stanway shooting well wide after being put through by Rachel Daly, who did well to draw two defenders and create space for her fellow substitute to unleash a shot. 88 min: Thorisdottir gets the first booking of the night for a rather agricultural challenge on Ellen White. England substitution: Rachel Daly on for Nikita Parris, who has had a good game, her penalty miss aside. 87 min: Norway substitution: Ingrid Moe Wold off, Caroline Graham Hansen on. 85 min: It was poor effort from Parris, who was made to wait a long time to take her penalty. She fired the ball at an easy height for Hjelmseth and placed it nearer the middle than the upright. Saved!!! Nikita Parris misses her second consecutive penalty as she is foiled by Norway goalkeeper Ingrid Hjelmseth, who flings herself to her right and bats the ball away. 82 min: At a set-piece, Steph Houghton gets in front of Thorisdottir as she chases the ball in flight and receives a shove in the back. It\u2019s a spot-kick for England. 80 min: England have now gone sixz hours without conceding a goal, a state of affairs I find surprising considering their habit of completely switching off for 10-minute periods in each game. 80 min: White is OK to continue, which is good news for England. 77 min: Ellen White and the Norway goalkeeper, Hjelmseth, leap for a high ball floated in over the top from Keire Walsh and both go down in a heap after a mid-air collision. White appears to have injured her left elbow on landing and receives treatment. 74 min: England substitution: Georgia Stanway on for Fran Kirby. Norway substitution: Amalie Eikeland on for Gura Reiten. Moments previously the outstanding centre-forward and substitute Utland had gone close for Norway once again, almost diverting a long-range effort from a team-mate into the England net with a deft back-heel that sent the ball mere inches wide of the upright. 71 min: Going back to Utland\u2019s first goalscoring opportunity \u2013 Karen Bardsley saved her effort with her feet and fouled the striker, who didn\u2019t go down. If she had, Norway would almost certainly have had a penalty and Bardsley might have been sent off. England have been absolutely awful in the past five minutes and have gifted Norway three excellent scoring chances. 69 min: Norway go close again, with Bardsley called into action to save the day. She gets strong hand to Caroline Graham Hanson\u2019s shot after the forward had outmuscled Bright to get on the end of a through ball from Ingrid Engen. 68 min: Another error from Bright results in Utland being put through again, this time by a team-mate. She unleashes a low drive that doesn\u2019t trouble Bardsley unduly. 66 min: An atrocious no-look back-pass to Karen Bardsley from Millie Bright finds its way to Utland, the recently introduced substitute, who unleashes a shot under pressure that is blocked on the line by Steph Houghton. 64 min: Norway substitution: Lisa-Marie Karlseng Utland comes on for Karina Saevik. Moments later, England win a corner. The ball\u2019s played short to Stokes, who creates an angle to get a cross in. It\u2019s too close to Hjelmseth, who clutches the ball to her stomach. 63 min: Lucy Bronze arrows a cross into the midfield from the right flank, trying to pick out Beth Mead. Her delivery is too close to the Norwegian keeper, Hjelmseth, who gathers comfortably. She could probably have done a little better for England\u2019s third goal \u2013 Bronze\u2019s howitzer appeared to go through her hands. 62 min: More heroics from Bronze, who is on hand to hack the ball out for a corner after Steph Houghton had misjudged the flight of a cross heading towards Herlovsen. Nothing comes from the set-piece. 59 min: Atrocious defending from Norway, who keep leaving Bronze unmarked at set pieces, despite getting repeated warnings. They\u2019ve paid a heavy price and have a mountain to climb if they\u2019re to get back into this game. I expected a lot more from them in this game, I must say, but they\u2019ve been very disappointing. They look very tired, which is unsurprising considering how reluctant their manager Martin Sjogren\u2019s reluctance to rotate his squad. It\u2019s three! Lucy Bronze rifles a surface-to-air screamer into the roof of the net from about 25 metres out after being left unmarked once again at a set-piece. From the dead ball situation, Beth Mead pulled the ball her way and Bronze unleashed a fantastic shot. 56 min: Lucy Bronze goes down after a tussle with Ingrid Engen, who concedes a free-kick between the right side of the Norway penalty area and the touchline. 55 min: Karen Bardsley comes off her line quickly to dive at the feet of Gura Reiten and prevent the Norway midfielder from clipping a shot home from the right side of the six-yard box. 53 min: Good play from Demi Stokes, who prevents Ingrid Moe Wold from getting a cross in from the right flank. England substitution: Toni Duggan off, Beth Mead on. 51 min: England win a free-kick wide on the right and with Lucy Bronze lurking with intent outside the area, Toni Duggan pulls the ball her way. Referee Lucila Venegas orders a retake and Norway again fail to pick up Bronze. Duggan sends a cross into the box this time, but it\u2019s cleared. 50 min: Ellen White tries to scuttle between two retreating defenders and latch on to a long ball from deep, but isn\u2019t quite quick enough. Moments later, Nikita Parris and Norway central defender Maria Thorisdottir get involved in a minor spat, but it\u2019s something and nothing. 47 min: Norway go perilously close to pulling a goal back after some atrocious defending from England. Steph Houghton is on hand to get back and intervene when Caroline Graham Hansen controlled a pass on the edge of the sixth yard box with her midriff and looked certain to score. 46 min: Norway get the ball rolling for the second half. Phil Neville speaks: \u201cSame again,\u201d he tells the BBC, upon being asked what\u2019s required in the second half. \u201cSame concentration, same speed of movement, same sequences of passes. It\u2019s about concentration now, discipline and we had that in the first half and we need it again.\u201d Both sets of players go in for the break with a two goal lead and are well worth it. JillScott opened the scoring within three minutes and Ellen White doubled their lead with five minutes of the half remaining. They\u2019ve dominated almost throughout, but have been prone to giving the ball away. They are killing Norway down the right flank, where Lucy Bronze and Nikita Parris have been irresistible. 45 min: More pressure from England. Demi Stokes sends a cross to the far post from the left flank. The goalkeeper leaps but can\u2019t get a hand to the ball and Jill Scott tries to hook it home. She can\u2019t quite get her foot around the ball and pokes it narrowly wide at full stretch. 42 min: Fran Kirby is down injured and receiving treatment after doing herself some sort of mischief in the build-up to Ellen White\u2019s fifth goal in this tournament. She\u2019s fit to continue. Play resumes and Demi Stokes is given a talking-to by referee Lucila Venegas, who ticks her off for kicking the ball away after a decision had gone against her. England double their lead courtesy of Ellen White. Down the right flank, Lucy Bronze plays the ball inside to Nikita Parris, who pings it goalwards around a defender and into the path of White. She sweeps the ball home from a couple of yards out. 38 min: Fran Kirby cuts inside from the left and lofts a cross to the far post. Nikita Parris beats her marker, Minde, but her downward header is poor and bounces off the turf and up into the waiting arms of Ingrid Hjelmsseth. 36 min: A poor touch from England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley, who makes a hash of trying to deal with a Steph Houghton back-pass. She gets away with it. Going back to that Ellen White shot that hit the woodwork a few minutes ago - she\u2019ll be gutted not to have scored. I\u2019ve just seen a replay and she really caught a bouncing, dropping ball with the sweet spot and unleashed a smashing right-footed volley which fizzed diagonally across the face of goal and smashed against the post. 33 min: There\u2019s no review, but the ball did hit the arm of Demi Stokes (not Bright, apologies - and it\u2019s not as if they look even remotely alike!), but only after it spun upwards after she\u2019d blocked it with her foot. Is that a handball these days? I honestly don\u2019t know any more. 31 min: Gura Reiten shoots from distance for Norway and her effort is blocked by Bright. The Norwegian appeals for handball and we might have a review once the ball goes out of play. 30 min: England are well worth their lead and could be as many as three goals to the good, but they are also capable of extreme sloppiness when it comes to giving the ball away. 27 min: A Jill Scott delivery from the left is blocked by Kristine Minde and England win a throw-in. It\u2019s taken and within seconds, England have rattled the woodwork, courtesy of an Ellen White strike that hits the upright. 26 min: Norway goalkeeper Ingrid Hjelmseth plucks the ball from the air as a ball from deep is lofted towards her goal with a mite too much welly. 24 min: Jill Scott loses the ball and Norway get forward with a three-on-three on the fringe of the England penalty area. Caroline Graham Hansen tries a shot from distance, but it\u2019s blocked by Bright. 23 min: England attack on the counter with White on the ball, but Norway\u2019s defenders get back to cover and avert the danger. 20 min: Nikita Parris does superbly to cut in from the right and take out a defender. With Ellen White unmarked in the centre, the winger elects to shoot instead of pass and skies a half-decent chance over the bar. England should be two up. 19 min: England continue to dominate possession and midfield and are enjoying particularly notable success down the right flank, with their Bronze-Parris axis. Bronze releases Ellen White down the right flank, but with no options open to her, she pings the ball backwards again. 17 min: Graham Hansen goes running down the inside right flank with the ball at her feet, but has a stop put to her gallop by Bronze, who dispossesses her and clears the danger. 14 min: Norway embark on a sortie into England territory, probing for an opening. The ball\u2019s crossed to Ingrid Moe Wold in the penalty area, who eschews the option to unleash a diagonal volley towards goal and then stymies her chances of fashioning any other kind of chance with a very heavy first touch. 12 min: England win a throw-in down by the managers\u2019 technical area, which Demi Stokes takes. Behind her, Phil Neville is looking very animated indeed. 10 min: Norway striker Isabell Herlovsen gets in behind Steph Houghton to latch on to a long ball down the left. Houghton gets back to get between Herlovsen and the goal and the Norwegian runs the ball out of play for a goal kick. 9 min: Norway win a corner after good work from Caroline Graham Hansen down the inside left. It too comes to nothing and a poor delivery is cleared by Millie Bright at the near post. 7 min: England corner, which comes to naught. They\u2019re completely bossing the early stages of this match, causing Norway all sorts of problems down both flanks. 6 min: From the left touchline, Toni Duggan sends a cross to the far post, where goalscorer Scott has made a run. The delivery is a mite too high for the midfielder. 5 min: A good lawyer could probably argue that Ellen White mis-kick was an intentional and very clever dummy, but I\u2019m not having it. She\u2019s welcome to claim otherwise. 4 min: What a start from England! Lucy Bronze gallops down the right flank and cuts inside before pulling the ball back from the byline. Ellen White swings a leg to convert but hits a fresh-air shot. The ball rolls to Jill Scott, who scuffs it home off the upright. 3 min: England take the lead courtesy of Jill Scott. 1 min: Nikita Parris gets an early cross into the Norway box from the right flank, trying to pick out Fran Kirby but Norway clear. Moments later, Demi Stokes gets the ball in from the left and the ball goes out for a corner off a Norway defender. The match officials award a goal-kick. 1 min: England get the ball rolling courtesy of Ellen White, their players wearing white shirts, white shorts and white socks. Norway\u2019s sport ... em, I\u2019m going to go with burgundy-fading-to-navy shirts, navy shorts and burgundy and navy socks. Not long now: Led by referee Lucia Venegas and her assistants, the Norway and England teams march out of the tunnel and on to the pitch, led by skippers Moren Mjelde and Steph Houghton. There are empty seats visible at the Stade de Oceane, but an estimated crowd of 20,000 is present. It\u2019s time for the national anthems and kick-off is less than five minutes away. David Beckham in the house: The former England international is here with his little girl, Harper, to cheer on England\u2019s Lionesses tonight. Phil Neville speaks: \u201cI\u2019m lucky in that I\u2019ve got two of the best left-backs in the world,\u201d he says to the BBC, upon being asked why Demi Stokes has come in tonight. \u201cWe just thought today with Demi\u2019s freshness and her ability to play tight alongside Millie Bright, that it would work to our advantage.\u201d Obligatory Ada Hegerberg mention: If Norway are to progress tonight, they will have to do so without the best player in the world, Ada Hegerberg. The Ballon D\u2019Or winner has stood herself down from the Norway team since after the 2017 Euros on the back of assorted grievances she has with her country\u2019s Football Association. They\u2019ve coped admirably without her so far. Norway: Hjelmseth, Moe Wold, Thorisdottir, Mjelde, Boe Risa, Herlovsen, Graham-Hansen, Engen, Reiten, Minde, Saevik. England: Bardsley, Bronze, Houghton, Bright, Stokes, Walsh, Parris, Scott, Kirby, Duggan, White. The teams are in and England fans will be pleased to learn that both Steph Houghton and Millie Bright start, despite Phil Neville saying they were both serious doubts ahead of tonight\u2019s game. Neville makes one change from the team that started against Cameroon, with Demi Stokes coming in for Alex Greenwood. Tonight\u2019s ticketing arrangements Travelling fans who bought their tickets for tonight\u2019s match from the FA were instructed to pick them up from a pub, no less. \u201cAll tickets must be collected by the lead booker from Le Trappist bar in Le Havre on matchday between 1pm-7pm,\u201d read an FA statement. Boasting a 4.5 star review on Trip Advisor, Le Trappist appears to bve renowned for its \u201cgreat atmosphere, fantastic beer selection and good prices\u201d. It also boasts a nice seafood menu, even if one French customer, who appears to be very much in the minority, claimed that \u201cmaintenant c\u2019est devenu trop commercial, froid, horrible, serveurs malaimables (now it is too commercial, cold, horrible and has unfriendly waiting staff\u201d. Ouch. Tonight\u2019s match officials Referee: Lucila Venegas (Mexico) Assistant Referee 1: Mayte Chavez (Mexico) Assistant Referee 2: Enedina Caudillo (Mexico) Fourth Official: Katalin Kulcsar (Hungary) VAR: Massimiliano Irrati (Italy) AVAR 1: Paolo Valeri (Italy) AVAR 2: Manuela Nicolosi (France) Lucila Venegas is the best referee in the North America, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF) regions and has won awards confirming as much in the past two years. A 37-year-old with a degree in Physical Culture and Sports from the University of Guadalajara, Ms Venegas obtained her Fifa badge 10 years ago. This is her second Women\u2019s World Cup and she also officiated at the Rio Olympics. Some pre-match listening Max Rushden asked the difficult questions as myself, Chris Paouros and Philippe Auclair previewed this match, talked about the latest crisis at Newcastle and took Derby fans to task over their hypocrisy, among other subjects, on the latest thrilling episode of our Football Weekly podcast.

Tonight\u2019s weather The temperature in Le Havre peaked at 27 degrees celsius today and is expected to be around 25 degrees at kick-off tonight with a cool breeze, dropping to 22 at around 11pm. Phil Neville has said he has no concerns about his players struggling in the heat. \u201cI think it\u2019s an English obsession, the weather,\u201d he said. \u201cWe actually like it being hot. We have provisions in place and we spent virtually two weeks in a sauna without air conditioning in St George\u2019s Park before coming to France. We know it will be hot, but the ball won\u2019t get tired if we pass it well.\u201d Two weeks in a sauna is a very long time. I can barely last 20 minutes. England\u2019s pre-match press conference Phil Neville and goalkeeper Karen Bardsley fronted up to face the press and field their interrogatory projectiles yesterday and you can hear what they had to say by watching the accompanying video. Early team news Despite television footage of her gadding about freely on the beach that suggests otherwise, Phil Neville says central defender Steph Houghton is a major doubt for tonight\u2019s game following the nasty foul on her ankle committed by Cameroon\u2019s Alexandra Takounda towards the end of their last game. Houghton\u2019s fellow centre-back Millie Bright has been laid low by a virus that has affected several members of the England camp to the varying degrees and is also a concern after being confined to barracks all day yesterday. Abbie McManus and Leah Williamson are on standby, but Neville will give both Houghton and Bright every chance of recovering from their respective maladies before making his final decision. Norway manager Martin Sjogren has a fully fit squad to choose from, his players having come through their round of 16 epic against Australia unscathed. Le Havre\u2019s Stade de Oc\u00e9ane ids the venue for the first of the Women\u2019s World Cup quarter-finals, which pits England against Norway. A place in the semi-finals against the USA or hosts France is up for grabs and while England go into the match as favourites, their preparations for this game have not gone entirely swimmingly since their win in a fractious match against Cameroon. Kick-off in Normandy is at 8pm (BST), but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
