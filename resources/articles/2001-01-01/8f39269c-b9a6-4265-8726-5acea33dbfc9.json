The demand was made by Brazilian congressmen yesterday during Ronaldo's appearance at a parliamentary inquiry into the $100m (\u00a367m) contract between Nike and the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), and the circumstances surrounding the 1998 World Cup final. He has 10 days to produce the document, but he flew out of Brasilia to his home in Rio de Janeiro yesterday leaving his lawyers, Nike's legal team and the congress's lawyers to decide how the contract should be handed over. The Internazionale striker is currently recuperating from a serious knee injury. The day's proceedings brought back uncomfortable memories of Brazil's 3-0 defeat by France in Paris. Ronaldo suffered a fit only hours before the final but was deemed to have recovered sufficiently to be inserted in the teamsheet minutes before kick-off. But he was a shadow of himself in the game. The 10-year Nike-CBF contract, the largest sponsorship deal with a national football side, has been controversial since it was signed in 1996. Politicians have been suspicious that psychological pressure from Nike may have brought about Ronaldo's fit, which in turn affected the team's performance. Others suggest he was forced to play by Nike despite medical advice. But Ronaldo told congressmen he played because he felt healthy enough and medical tests after the fit had showed there was nothing wrong. He refused to reveal details of his personal contract with Nike - believed to be worth $1m a year - when asked by congressmen. But the inquiry's lawyers said he was legally obliged to submit the document. Ronaldo said that if his contract was made public there would be no surprises. \"There is no clause saying what I had to do during the World Cup. My relationship with Nike is very good. They never demanded me to do anything. The only thing they wanted was for me to score some goals wearing their boots.\" More than 30 people have been interviewed over issues stemming from the Nike-CBF contract. Edmundo, who was originally given Ronaldo's place in the final only to be demoted to substitute, the then Brazil coach Mario Zagallo and his team doctors in France 98 have all given evidence about events at the squad's hotel on the day of the final. For virtually every other country second place in a World Cup would be a source of pride but in Brazil the result was seen as an embarrassing failure. Since football success is seen as important to Brazil's national identity, politicians launched a congressional inquiry into the causes of the defeat. A second inquiry is focusing on the organisation and alleged corruption of the domestic game. Politicians are trying to open up the workings of the CBF, which is run by Ricardo Teixeira, the former son-in-law of Joao Havelange, who ran football's world governing body Fifa for 24 years. Suspicion of Nike's influence grew when the contract with the CBF was revealed to include a clause committing Brazil to 50 \"Nike friendlies\" in which at least eight first-team regulars had to play. Ronaldo yesterday came to the multinational company's defence, saying it promoted Brazilian football all over the world and invested heavily in the national team. He said Brazilians were ungrateful. \"If I was Nike I'd not think twice about ripping up the contract and leaving Brazil.\" The questioning yesterday centred on Ronaldo's mysterious fit in Paris. Zagallo said that he was asleep in his room during the afternoon of the final. However, Edmundo and the team doctors said the coach visited Ronaldo in his room. Ronaldo also slept that afternoon and, having woken after his fit, he was not told what had happened until another player, Leonardo, asked him if he was feeling well. Then he was taken to a Paris clinic for tests. These showed him to be healthy and he went straight to the Stade de France to play. Ronaldo authorised the records taken at the clinic to be released to the inquiry. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
