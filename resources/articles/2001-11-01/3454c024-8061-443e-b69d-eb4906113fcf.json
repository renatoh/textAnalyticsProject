This painting in wax-based pigments on a limewood panel fixed over the face of a mummy belongs to a genre of realistic portraiture of which examples have been found from the Mediterranean coast as far south as Thebes. The highest concentration is in the Fayum oasis southwest of Cairo. This kind of portraiture - the most convincing to survive anywhere before the Renaissance portraits of van Eyck and Bellini - is a synthesis of Egyptian and Greco-Roman art. Egyptian art may look austere from a distance but up close it is full of quirks. A funerary statue of Seneb, keeper of the king's wardrobe, from about 2400BC, in the Cairo Museum, faithfully records that Seneb was a dwarf. However, the descriptive realism of the Fayum mummy portraits owes its look to Greek and Roman traditions. Mimesis - the imitation of appearances - was valued in classical painting. Pliny the Elder tells of a contest in which the Greek artist Zeuxis painted some grapes so realistically that birds pecked at them. Fayum mummy paintings are startling examples of ancient painters' attempts to reproduce the world of appearances; when we look on these pictures we believe we are seeing the faces of the dead. Subject: The Greek inscription on this young man's painted stucco case says: \"Artemidorus - farewell!\" He was found in 1888 at Hawara in the Fayum by William Matthew Flinders Petrie (1853-1942), one of the greatest excavators of ancient Egypt. Cruder Roman-era mummy portraits had been known since the 17th century, but it was Petrie's dig that turned up masterpieces. Artemidorus was in a group of three mummies that Petrie saw with excitement: \"a procession of three gilt mummies... glittering in the sun\". Cat scans reveal a blow to the back of Artemidorus's head - this could have happened in the mummifying process, or he may have died violently. Distinguishing features: Portraits often have a consciously memorial quality. It is, however, unusual to look at a painted portrait fixed over the body of the person it tries to preserve. Many Fayum portraits have been separated from their mummies. But Artemidorus still lies in his red casing, his portrait over his face. Although made under Roman rule, this mummy is decorated with symbols of Egyptian magic to transport the dead into the afterlife; below the portrait is a gold leaf vignette of the god Anubis attending the mummy; in another Osiris rises from his bier. This portrait is the face Artemidorus took with him into the afterlife. And what a face. He's painted with lifelike subtlety, every hair in his fringe picked out (his hairstyle dates him to Trajan's reign), with a little hair over his upper lip. His features are modelled in three dimensions - Roman painting is notable for its acute use of shading to give objects volume. What Pompeian wall paintings do for fruit, this portrait does for Artemidorus, shading his cheeks and nose. Does this look anything like the real Artemidorus? Petrie believed the Fayum portraits were done during life. Cat scans of mummies that still have portraits attached reveal that while the portraits are idealised, they bear a basic resemblance to the deceased. In this case the young man portrayed is the right age, but the painter has made his face thinner - a touching detail. Now here he is, nearly two millennia after his death, preserved in London, a face from the past that makes you stop and look. Artemidorus - farewell! Inspirations and influences: Fayum mummy portraits became a cult in the late 19th century. The encaustic medium used by mummy painters was revived by Jasper Johns in his deathly depictions of the American flag. Where is it?
