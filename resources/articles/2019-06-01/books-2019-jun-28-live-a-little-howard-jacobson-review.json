Before a reader dwells on the slowly developing relationship between nonagenarian Beryl Dusinbery and the somewhat younger but no spring chicken Shimi Carmelli, they might find their eye drawn elsewhere. To the psychological fate of the young Shimi, for example, caught trying on his mother\u2019s bloomers and thereafter consigned to \u201cboy-hell \u2013 the Cave of All Humiliations where bed-wetters and fledgling masturbators sit with their heads in their hands while grinning devils in caps and bells roar ridicule in their ears\u201d (it\u2019s worth reading that fragment aloud to appreciate its rhythmic implacability). Or, perhaps, to the bloodlust implied by Beryl\u2019s naming of two of her sons, who have grown up to be politicians in opposing camps: one is called Pen, short for Pentheus, torn apart by his mother in Greek myth; and the other Sandy, \u201cas must be no less obvious, being short for Tisander who was murdered by Medea\u201d. She is fond of neither, unsurprisingly. The three novels that precede Live a Little were, in different ways, one-time-only offers. Pussy, Jacobson\u2019s last, is a satire written in furious haste after the election of Donald Trump; Shylock Is My Name is part of a series in which novelists reframe the works of Shakespeare; and J: A Novel was Jacobson\u2019s first foray into dystopia (which is not to say that a dystopic strand doesn\u2019t run through much of his work). This novel would seem to return him to more recognisable waters \u2013 the terror and humiliations of intimacy, the torment both of desire and its absence, the ceaseless reminders of past failure, all of which often find themselves playing out on the streets of north London. In this case, one particular street, Finchley Road, a funny stretch of dusty dual carriageway with posher bits \u2013 St John\u2019s Wood and Hampstead \u2013 at either end, and tree-lined avenues of big houses concealed on both sides. It is socioeconomically broad enough to encompass both Beryl\u2019s grand mansion flat, in which even the ensuites have ensuites, and Shimi\u2019s less salubrious flat above the Fing Ho Chinese Banquet Restaurant, in which establishment he practises the art of cartomancy, or telling fortunes based on a deck of cards. His principal customers are Jewish widows, whose main concerns are that his predictions include the possibility of them charming him \u2013 for, with his steady hands and raffish bow tie, Shimi is one of the area\u2019s most eligible bachelors of a certain age. If only they knew: Shimi\u2019s inner life does not suggest a promising suitor. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a loser in my world,\u201d he thinks gloomily to himself, reflecting on his inability to make women happy. And he doesn\u2019t do much better with his birth family, either; a dead mother who found herself frightened by everything, and the subsequent disappearances of his father and brother add to his suspicion that he is nothing but a great big jinx on happiness. For half the novel, Jacobson keeps the two principals apart, which allows Beryl \u2013 naturally more attention-grabbing \u2013 to dominate. Her reminiscences, written in her diary of conquests or casually dispensed to her two carers, Euphoria and Nastya, are enough to pull the reader into her orbit (\u201cRory the Tory. Lord Piston Pete. Duke of Smegma Magna was my name for him,\u201d she remembers of one of her babyfathers. \u201cDon\u2019t try that piston stuff on me, I\u2019d warned him. I\u2019m not an oilfield\u201d). Her issue is not lack of confidence, but an excess of it; not for nothing does she dub herself the Princess. \u201cIt was said of me,\u201d she tells Euphoria, \u201cthat I beggared belief. It isn\u2019t for me to confirm that or deny it. But I can tell you that the second man to marry me fainted when he saw me coming towards him in my wedding gown and tiara. It took half an hour to bring him round.\u201d As the body and mind begin to fail \u2013 Shimi\u2019s bladder rules his life, and Beryl\u2019s sang-froid is only shaken by her failure to find the right words when she wants them \u2013 is it better to view your history as a catalogue of pain and loss, or as a dizzying and melodramatic opera? Perhaps more to the point, is it a matter of free will or a slow and inevitable working out of personality? Live a Little is a meander of a novel that nonetheless feels urgent \u2013 not least because one fears either of its two central characters might keel over at any point. But for all its moments of bleakness, and the occasional flicker of genuine terror, it\u2019s rarely less than bitterly funny in its determination to face up to the obliteration that awaits us all. \u2022 Live a Little is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a318.99).
