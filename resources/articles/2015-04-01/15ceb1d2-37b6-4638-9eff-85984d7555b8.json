For all that, the astonishing yield of 25% on three-year Greek government debt is sending a clear message. The home straight has arrived and the choice for Athens and the governing Syriza party is becoming simple: capitulate to the rest of the eurozone\u2019s demands for economic reforms, or leave the euro. \u201cNobody expects that there will be a solution,\u201d said Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, on Wednesday, referring to next week\u2019s meetings in Riga, billed as a make-or-break moment for agreement on releasing bailout cash to Athens. Ten days ahead of talks, the remark amounted to yet another reminder from Sch\u00e4uble that Germany thinks the eurozone could cope with the fallout from a Greek exit. As it happens, Berlin\u2019s judgment looks far too breezy. A Greek default can only damage the eurozone. Two bailout agreements and four years of diplomatic shuffling would have failed, with unknown long-term consequences for the survival of the single currency. But Germany seems to have made its choice: it will accept the risks. Over in Washington, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Christine Lagarde avoided downbeat remarks about Riga, but said nothing remotely cheerful for Athens. \u201cWe have never had an advanced economy asking for repayment delay,\u201d she said. In other words, the IMF\u2019s hands are tied, and Athens should not ask for a delay in repayments. One of those payments, totalling \u20ac747m (\u00a3540m), falls next month. Time is running short. Of course, it should not have come to this. Greece\u2019s debt burden is unsustainable, and it was madness for lenders to impose bailout demands that shrank the Greek economy by 20%. But the reality for Syriza is that it faces an \u201cimpossible trinity\u201d, as Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysts call it. How do you stay in the euro, remain in power and undo the bailout programme? It can\u2019t be done. Something has to give. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tspiras, doing his best to offset Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s remarks, said he is \u201cfirmly optimistic\u201d that a deal can be reached in Riga. Good luck to him, but it is now very hard to see how any deal could be remotely consistent with Syriza\u2019s electoral mandate to end austerity. In that case, there would be three possible next chapters. In order of likelihood, they are: capitulation; a Greek referendum on staying in the euro; a rapid exit without a referendum. Silent on Alliance Another day, another voice calling for new directors at Alliance Trust. This time it\u2019s US outfit ISS that says Dundee\u2019s ancient investment house would benefit from some backside-kicking by outsiders, as proposed by 12% shareholder Elliott Advisors, an off-shoot of a US hedge fund. The view here is the same as a fortnight ago. Many of the grumbles about Alliance \u2013 the high pay of the chief executive, Katherine Garrett-Cox, the middling investment performance, the \u201cjam tomorrow\u201d promises about two subsidiaries \u2013 are legitimate, but shareholders need to hear from the three men Elliott wants on the board. Anthony Brooke, Peter Chambers and Rory Macnamara may be fine City chaps, but their silence is inexcusable. Why do they want to join Alliance? What assurances can they offer that they would be properly independent and wouldn\u2019t act as Elliott\u2019s placemen? Do they think Alliance requires a full strategic review? These are not hard questions to answer and this is an election. The candidates should speak. The vote is on 29 April, which leaves little time for the grandees to introduce themselves belatedly. If they won\u2019t, shareholders should hold their noses and back the current board. Whisky sour It\u2019s still tough out there, said Diageo boss Ivan Menezes as the spirits and beer group unveiled a 0.7% fall in organic sales for the quarter. Actually, life\u2019s not so bad, said Unilever. \u201cWe are now starting to see more tailwinds than headwinds in our markets,\u201d said chief executive Paul Polman. Underlying sales were up 2.8%. A boss can only speak about his own company, but the difference in tunes is striking. For Diageo investors, the biggest worry is not emerging markets (always volatile), but the US, where the group still longs for the day consumers recycle their savings on petrol into purchases of whisky, vodka and rum. If the punters are instead preferring more Unilever deodorants and ice cream, something very odd is happening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
