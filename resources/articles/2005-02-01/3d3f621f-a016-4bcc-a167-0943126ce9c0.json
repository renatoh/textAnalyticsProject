The European governing body is to test the idea, which would mean taking retrospective action against offenders whether or not the referee has seen enough of an incident to give a decision at the time, in this season's remaining Champions League and Uefa Cup matches. The FA is awaiting the first test case. \"We can act in incidents where the referee has been cheated,\" said Uefa's disciplinary manager Peter Limacher. \"If the referee has seen the simulation and punishes it with a caution, this can only be deemed as an attempt at simulation. However, if a player succeeded in cheating the referee, then this offence is much larger and more serious than the one covered by the laws.\" The FA is mindful of the hostile reaction to its inability to charge Diouf under current rules, though it has begun to tackle simulation by sanctioning another Bolton player, Tal Ben Haim, who tumbled after being brushed by Wayne Rooney and who received a three-match ban retrospectively. Soho Square is keen to stamp out cheating and one solution is a redefining of what is meant by \"seen by a referee\". \"Uefa can make use of video evidence,\" said Limacher. \"The disciplinary body is ready to instigate proceedings with the possibility of the player being punished.\" Teams who finish third in their qualifying groups for Euro 2008 could still reach the finals if Uefa agrees to a new process tomorrow. The ruling body may opt to have seven groups, with the winners qualifying and the second- and third-placed teams playing off to join them. Everton and Middlesbrough have both requested personal FA hearings after admitting charges of failing to control their players during last month's 1-1 draw at the Riverside where a brawl involving 21 players broke out. Alan Knill has been appointed Rotherham's caretaker manager until the end of the season after Ronnie Moore agreed a severance package with the South Yorkshire club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
