The Harlequins\u2019 director of rugby, Conor O\u2019Shea, has also praised Robshaw for resisting the temptation to fire back at his critics following the host nation\u2019s premature World Cup exit. O\u2019Shea remains upset by some of the flak Robshaw has received and hopes Jones will not be unduly swayed by external pressure to ditch the incumbent captain from his Six Nations lineup. \u201cYou can see I get irritated by it because I\u2019m unbelievably protective of someone I think deserves a heck of a lot more than some of the cheap jibes that have been directed at him. That\u2019s all they are. Very cheap, very populist, very easy. \u201cHe was always going to be on a hiding to nothing in the World Cup. I think as a rugby player, a bloke and a role model we should be very proud we\u2019ve had somebody like Chris. He could easily have reacted, have come out and said some spiteful things back to people. He could have said what he thought. I could have said what I thought about some of the people who were talking about him. But he didn\u2019t. He kept his counsel, he\u2019s done what he\u2019s always done and he\u2019s got on with it. Some people have said they\u2019d like to see him come out and say something but that just creates a headline and ill will.\u201d Jones officially takes over as England coach next Tuesday and one of his first stated intentions is to meet Robshaw for a coffee and a chat. O\u2019Shea accepts the Australian may be looking for a different leader but reckons Robshaw is too valuable to the squad to jettison. \u201cI don\u2019t give a fiddler\u2019s if he\u2019s captain or not any more. He\u2019s England\u2019s second most-capped captain of all time. A lot of new coaches come in and make changes but I\u2019m sure Eddie Jones will come in, have a look, pick his best team and then the best player to captain the side will be picked. If that\u2019s not Chris, that\u2019s not a headline. \u201cWhether he\u2019s captain, whether he\u2019s 6 or 7 I frankly don\u2019t care. What I do know is that he wants it 100%. In a weird way England not succeeding in the World Cup has actually given huge motivation to a lot of players they might not have had if they\u2019d won the World Cup. If they had, who\u2019s to say they would have had an Everest to climb? Now they have got something completely different to prove.\u201d England kick off their Six Nations campaign against Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday 6 February and Jones has a number of back-row candidates to consider. He has already indicated he is aware of \u201cfour or five\u201d potential open-side options but O\u2019Shea argues Robshaw bears comparison with the world\u2019s best. \u201cI think he\u2019s just an outstanding rugby player. He\u2019s proven that. He\u2019s beaten Richie McCaw and the All Blacks \u2026 he\u2019s beaten Sam Warburton in individual battles. I\u2019ll pick the positives, some will pick the negatives. \u201cOpinions are very short term in sport. One day you can be a hero, the next you are zero. As Dick Best [a former Quins and England coach] put it: \u2018From back stabbing to back slapping it\u2019s only a heartbeat.\u2019 By the time the Six Nations comes around everybody will be talking it up, whoever is playing for England. That\u2019s the way it is in sport. You get on with it. \u201cIf we\u2019re achieving and right up the top end [of the table] I\u2019ve no doubt Chris Robshaw will be in the team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
