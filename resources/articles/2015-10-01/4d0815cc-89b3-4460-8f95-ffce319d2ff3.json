Less than a month ago West told Vanity Fair that he was nowhere near to having his forthcoming album Swish, the follow-up to 2013\u2019s Yeezus, ready, but the two tracks emerged on a new Soundcloud account on Monday. Say You Will featuring Caroline Shaw is a new version of the opening track from West\u2019s highly influential album 808s and Heartbreaks, which saw him take on a sombre, introspective approach that has since been riffed on by everyone from the Weeknd to Frank Ocean. In September, West performed the album in its entirety at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles with a string section. Shaw is a Grammy and Pulitzer-winning violinist. The remix sees her stuttering and cut-up vocals layered over the track, which is largely unchanged with the exception of strings, plucked instrumentation and a ghostly looped vocal. When I See It sees West use a track he produced \u2013 the Weeknd\u2019s Tell Your Friends \u2013 which is a downtempo, minimal back-beat accompanied by a sample (Soul Dog\u2019s Can\u2019t Stop Loving You) that recalls his pre-808s output. Whether or not fans will be able to glean anything about a new direction from a remix and a cover, West embracing Soundcloud and launching surprise releases is an exciting prospect from an artist whose focus has been elsewhere recently."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
