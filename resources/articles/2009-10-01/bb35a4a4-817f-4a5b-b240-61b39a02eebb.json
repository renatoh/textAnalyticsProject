But the pop hooks that are the soundtrack to their day jobs are largely absent here, replaced by a downbeat, piano-led sound that is closer to the more pensive strains of late 90s chill-out and trance. Tantalising signs of a suppressed pop mojo, such as the distorted synth line that snakes through the generic soul of \"Black and Blue\", add to the frustration of a pedestrian debut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
