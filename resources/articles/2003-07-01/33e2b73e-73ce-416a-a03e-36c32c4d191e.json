However, the Volcano's performance merited the usual range of adjectives - blockbusting, powerful, even awesome, only with knobs on. Or rather bobbles. Bradford came into this game on the back of three consecutive defeats at Odsal, and for the first half-hour there seemed a real possibility of Widnes taking that total to four. But Vainikolo, who has been so much better in his second season with the Bulls than the hesitant lump who was so often exposed last year, played the key role in overturning a 6-0 deficit to establish a 10-point half-time lead. He scored a second unstoppable try after the break, one of seven which took the Bulls back to within two points of Leeds at the top of the table. They were not wholly convincing, but this was still a useful performance considering the absence of key players such as Stuart Fielden and Robbie Paul. \"That was a super team performance,\" said Bradford's coach Brian Noble, although he agreed that Vainikolo had stood out in more ways than one. \"He's pretty awesome at the moment, isn't he? He had 26 carries from the back field and that's an amazing effort.\" The Widnes coach Neil Kelly agreed, saying: \"All credit to him, he had a great game. But I think too many of our lads have paid too much respect to the opposition instead of getting their shoulders in. We defended well in the first half but in the end we've let some loud music and some zany hairdos put us off.\" An early Widnes try did nothing to ease Bradford's nerves, especially as it came courtesy of a rare error by Tevita Vaikona. He was surprised by a kick from Dean Lawford, allowing it to run between his legs for Adam Hughes to touch down. Hughes rejected an offer from Hull to sign a new two-year contract with Widnes on Saturday, one third of a treble boost for the Cheshire club as the former Bulls full-back Stuart Spruce agreed to defer his retirement by one more season, and the pacy young wing Paul Devlin agreed to a new one-year deal. They did remarkably well to hold out until the 24th minute as Bradford got their act together, going back to basics with strong drives from their huge forwards to put the Vikings on the back foot. The pressure finally told in the 24th minute when Shontayne Hape stretched over on the left, and two more tries in the last 10 minutes of the first half gave Bradford a 16-6 interval lead. First Hape did what any centre should do inside Vainikolo, simply give him the ball quickly, and the Tongan's bulk did the rest. Vainikolo then instigated a brilliant handling move with the first of several unlikely passes which finally led to Vaikona sending in the substitute Lee Radford. Widnes competed strongly again in the early stages of the second half and cut their deficit by two points with a Julian O'Neill penalty. But Vainikolo then battled through no fewer than five attempted tackles to plunge over from close range, helped by a timely push from James Lowes, to remove any doubts about the outcome. Within four minutes Vaikona was powering over on the right flank, and further tries from the impressive young full-back Stuart Reardon and a second from Radford completed a satisfying night for the Bulls.
