Speaking after Villa defeated Crystal Palace on Tuesday to end a winless run in the league that stretched back to early August, Okore refused to accept relegation is a foregone conclusion and said \u201ceverything seems possible\u201d if they beat Leicester and Albion. Although that will be easier said than done for a team who remain anchored to the foot of the table, there was no escaping the change in the mood at Villa Park on the back of the 1-0 victory over Palace. Okore spoke about the way Leicester spectacularly turned around their season last year when they won seven of their last nine league games to climb off the bottom and pull clear, and said Villa\u2019s players needed to take inspiration from that achievement. \u201cThey did really well last year. If they can do it, we need to believe we can do it too,\u201d the Villa defender said. Asked whether he believes Villa can still survive, Okore replied: \u201cWe all believe we can do it. We wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise. Against Palace we showed we can work hard, and we have the belief we can get on a run now with two big games coming up. If we get something against those two teams then everything seems possible.\u201d The poor performance against Wycombe Wanderers in the FA Cup on Saturday proved to be a tipping point for Villa supporters, who were angry with events on as well as off the field. Brad Guzan and Joleon Lescott, who scored the winning goal against Palace, are alleged to have sworn at Villa fans and there was mutiny in the air at the end of that 1-1 draw, with R\u00e9mi Garde also coming under fire. Okore admitted the players\u2019 pride has been hurt during an abysmal run of results and also said it has taken time to adapt to Garde\u2019s methods since he replaced Tim Sherwood as manager in November. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy with the change of manager. It can take a little time for the players to buy into the system and get used to the system and what the manager wants us to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a bit more comfortable in what the manager wants from us and that\u2019s paying off now.\u201d The bottom line, though, is that Villa still need to produce an extraordinary run of results \u2013 bordering on a football miracle in the context of their season so far \u2013 to have a chance of staying up. \u201cI don\u2019t know about miracles but it\u2019d be a really big thing,\u201d Okore said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that won\u2019t be forgotten in a hurry if we stay up. This situation is not easy. I hope we can stay up and people won\u2019t forget how we fought to do it in the last part of the season to show we belong in this league.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
