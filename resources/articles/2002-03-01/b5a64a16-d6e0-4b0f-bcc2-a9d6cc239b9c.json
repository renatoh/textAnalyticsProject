The man from the emergency services laughed down the line when the manager gave his name. Then, in a show of sympathy, his players presented him on arrival with a petrol can - empty, of course. Leicester have been running on the thinnest hope for months, this draw merely another marker along the road to relegation. In another context it may be invaluable. For Bassett and his players, the most meaningful target now is to avoid descending as the lowest of all the Premiership low. That means beating Watford's 24 points in 2000. This, at least, promises to be a close-run thing. The draw with Charlton, one of the Premiership's best away teams, represents an improvement, ending a run of seven defeats. It also contained arguably Leicester's best half-hour in many weeks. This appeared to be overlooked by Tony Cottee and Frank McLintock, of Leicester's recent and distant past, who formed a Sky TV style council in judging their old club's performance. \"Desperate stuff,\" declared Cottee. \"It really was poor,\" moaned McLintock. This was a little cruel and a little unfair, even if they had a point about Leicester playing so much to the head of Brian Deane. It overlooked the quality of Leicester's goal, created by the penetrative run of the inexperienced but impressive Matthew Piper and the clinical finish of James Scowcroft's header, and the goalline clearances that denied Piper and Frank Sinclair. As it was, Charlton were saved by Jason Euell's 12th goal of the season, a simple shot amid Leicester's defensive disarray, and Bassett's team concluded their 13th premiership game without a win. Unlucky? Bassett partly puts his time in charge down to that. \"I'm hard pressed to recall a more bizarre and depressing five-month period where things have gone so consistently and remorselessly wrong,\" he wrote in the match programme. Now Leicester's directors have to confront some increasingly uncomfortable facts. A year ago this weekend, before the Wycombe Cup d\u00e9bcle, the team were fourth in the Premiership. Since then they have been in freefall. This season Bassett's record (13 points from 21 games) is no better than the sacked Peter Taylor's (five from eight). Under each Leicester have gleaned less than one point from every available five. Charlton, for their part, are on course to repeat, if not better, their impressive ninth-place finish last season. Yet they appear more concerned with falling just short of the 40-point safety mark. If this seems excessively cautious, Leicester's startling decline explains it. After all, not so long ago Alan Curbishley held up Leicester as a model of club progress. Nothing can be taken for granted, said Charlton's England left-back Chris Powell. \"It's not unreasonable to say that any team in the bottom half can go down. Even where we are the situation is tight. If we lost two or three games on the trot, we could catapult downwards. There's always one team which drops into it and we don't want to be that one.\" Man of the match: Scott Parker (Charlton Athletic). \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
