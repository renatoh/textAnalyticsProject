He was giving an interview to ITV\u2019s Joe Pike, and Pike tried to get him to comment on a picture of four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr having to sleep on the floor in Leeds general hospital, where he was being treated for suspected pneumonia, because there were no beds available. The picture makes today\u2019s Daily Mirror splash. Johnson repeatedly refused to comment on the picture, which Pike had on his phone, and kept making general points about the NHS. It is not unusual for politicians to avoid difficult topics in interviews, but as he was speaking Johnson took Pike\u2019s phone and placed it in his pocket (apparently to stop Pike asking further questions about it), thinking his ploy would be out of shot. But the cameraman filmed what he was doing, and Pike revealed it to viewers, and so the clip when viewed in its entirety is much more damaging to Johnson than the usual \u201cpolitician dodges tricky question\u201d footage. Labour has been saying it is evidence that Johnson \u201ccould not care less\u201d. Pike\u2019s clip has now attracted 3.7m views. One of the features of this election is broadcast journalists increasingly using short interviews to record combative clips that go viral on social media. Granada\u2019s Hannah Miller achieved the same thing at the weekend, confronting Johnson with challenging questions about cuts to children\u2019s services. Lord Reith would probably not approve, but given that Johnson is avoiding a lot of long-form media scrutiny during this campaign, like the Andrew Neil interview, it is not surprising that some of the reporters who do get the chance to ask him questions are going for him robustly. Viewers probably want to see politicians quizzed like this. This definitely counts as a bad day for Johnson, but in trying to assess how much difference it might make, it is important to keep things in perspective. It is not as bad as when Gordon Brown called a woman a bigot in the 2010 campaign for raising concerns about immigration, and post-election analysis subsequently concluded that bigot-gate had no effect on the result at all. Labour even won the constituency where the voter was insulted. Tories blamed over false assault claim ITV\u2019s Robert Peston has blamed \u201csenior Tories\u201d for telling him and other journalists that a special adviser to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had been assaulted by anti-Tory protesters outside Leeds general hospital. Subsequent video footage shows that the aide, Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, was accidentally hit by an outstreched arm. \u2026 and Mail blamed over false Labour tax claim The Mail on Sunday falsely claimed that Labour was planning to scrap a tax exemption on homeowners, in a prominent story that has since been used by the Conservatives as part of their election campaign. The press regulator Ipso ruled that the newspaper\u2019s reporting was inaccurate and \u201ccould cause significant concern to readers that, under a Labour government, they could be liable to pay a tax they are exempt from under current legislation\u201d. \u2018Dead cat\u2019 flung at BBC Boris Johnson has threatened to take the BBC\u2019s licence fee away. He made the surprise revelation that this policy was under consideration at a Q&amp;A where he was facing hostile questions about his botched TV interview on the Leeds general hospital incident. His comments had all the hallmarks of a famous \u201cdead cat\u201d \u2013 a term Johnson himself first put into the public domain, when he was revealing how the Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby (whose prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Isaac Levido is running the Conservative campaign) uses big media stories to distract attention from events that are getting negative coverage. Meanwhile Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has accused Boris Johnson of breaking his word over the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has revealed some of the contents of the first budget that he says Labour will hold on Wednesday 5 February if it wins the election. A Conservative general election candidate shared messages on social media claiming Muslims play the \u201crace card\u201d and have a \u201cnasty culture\u201d, in the latest escalation of concern over Islamophobia in the party.
