The answer is that this column has always been about politics and economics - 'political economy' - and in recent months, the politics has been far more interesting than the economics. But this does not mean that Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, has succeeded in his aim of making the work of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) so boring that nobody pays any attention to it. Indeed, the governor can hardly open his mouth without being quoted on the front pages and the airwaves. There have been two interesting speeches on the economy in the past fortnight, one by the governor, and one by Sir Alan Budd. There have also been some interesting statistics, surveys and corporate statements suggesting that the pace of growth in the economy is slowing down. First to Budd, who was chief economic adviser to the Treasury during the chancellorships of Norman Lamont and Kenneth Clarke. His period in this role, 1991-97, included the more torrid phase of our membership of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), though when we entered it he was still in the private sector. He argued in the 2004 Wincott Foundation Lecture that the 'final objective' of ERM membership was to control inflation, after all other devices, including the monetarist approach he once advocated, had failed. Or, as he gently put it: 'I hope I can say without offending anyone that the experiment in seeking to control inflation by setting quantitative monetary targets did not match the hopes of its most enthusiastic supporters [among whom I am willing to count myself].' Professor Milton Friedman made a similar confession just over a year ago. Leave aside any thoughts that joining the ERM was about wanting to be more 'European'. For Budd, and many in the Treasury, the ERM was the counter-inflation policy of last resort. In a somewhat revisionist view of history, Budd argues that the ERM episode was, in this respect, a resounding success. 'I believe we joined at the right time and left at the right time, but that was a matter of luck rather than skill.' His thesis is that, having failed to devise a successful monetary policy before, 'somehow, when we left the ERM, we discovered how to do it'. Disarmingly, he recalls a 'particularly painful' City lunch in the (financially) hot summer of 1992 when he remarked that, if Britain were to leave the ERM, 'our credibility would be completely destroyed'. His host replied: 'That depends on what replaces it'. I recall a lunch around that time when I asked a certain Treasury official why they had (at the time) made it a policy of 'double' rather than 'quits' (the quits came on Black Wednesday, 16 September that year). His reply was: 'The Treasury has lost one Chancellor [reference to Nigel Lawson's dramatic resignation in 1989]. We cannot afford to lose another.' Well, as Budd points out, what replaced ERM membership was the system of inflation targets and monthly meetings of the Chancellor and governor (which became known as 'the Ken and Eddie Show'), publication of the Bank of England Inflation Reports and, hey presto, the deus ex machina of Gordon Brown and his granting of operational independence to the Bank of England in 1997. Post hoc, ergo propter hoc? (After this, therefore on account of this?) I wonder. Budd may proclaim 'it is universally acknowledged that the current framework for monetary policy in the UK is as close to perfection as fallible men can hope to achieve', but the fact of the matter is that all this coincided with a remarkably disinflationary climate around the world. And, of course, Brown and Ed Balls would argue that it was only after 1997 that inflationary expectations in the UK were really brought down. Budd's thesis is superficially appealing, but does not seem to this observer to justify the extraordinary pain inflicted on the British economy by the ERM episode - from which many businesses and individuals may never have fully recovered. Which brings us to Mervyn King, and his speech last week at the Eden Project in Cornwall. Is the victory Budd has declared over inflation a permanent one? The governor is not so sure. 'Eden' is the reference point of the month. In his lecture, Budd half-joked that 'My usual preference, when talking about economic issues, is to start with the garden of Eden and work slowly forward, leaving the events in question to be discussed in a great rush in the closing minutes of the lecture.' I know the feeling. King, speaking on the site of the environmental exhibition at the Eden Project where, among other things, there is a tropical area, decided to hot things up. 'After all,' said the governor. 'Starting from the garden of Eden, there can only be a fall from grace.' The Chancellor must occasionally wonder about the day he made the Bank independent, and the second day (not the next day) on which he appointed King as governor. It was King who said on 14 June on the Chancellor's own territory (Scotland): 'It is clear that the chances of falls in house prices are greater than they were.' His remarks, producing headlines such as 'Governor warns of house price crash', had a huge impact. Indeed, some advanced economic historians already date the turn in the housing market to that speech. The Treasury was furious. 'The Bank is so amateurish in these matters', said the spinners. But the Bank was not amateurish at all. Indeed, internal Bank betting was pretty accurate at forecasting the following day's headlines. They wanted to make that kind of impact. So, here we go, onwards to the Eden Project, or backwards to the garden of Eden. King first reminds us that, about a year ago, he had described the period since the 1980s as a Non-inflationary Consistently Expansionary - or 'Nice decade - in which economic growth was above trend, unemployment fell steadily and inflation remained 'low and stable'. But, he asks, will it last? What he did not go on to say is: Do you want political spin, well-timed for the next General Election, or do you want the views of a serious, analytical, and hawkish governor of the Bank of England? 'What is clear,' he then said, 'is that the combination of low and stable inflation and continuously falling unemployment must come to an end at some point.' In case you are not fully awake, the sting in the tail was 'and may already have done so'. Mindful of the lessons of history and the burgeoning crisis caused by a $50-plus price of oil per barrel, King warned about future fluctuations 'in growth and unemployment, as well as inflation'. According to King, the Nice decade will be followed by the Not So Bad Decade. We shall see. This government has succeeded beyond its expectations in avoiding financial crises. It is not in the garden of Eden from the economic point of view, but it has a Prime Minister who has been as rash as Anthony Eden was over Suez. Despite the abysmal condition of the Tory Party and Michael Howard's position over the war, I still believe Britain intends to punish Blair for the biggest foreign policy misjudgment since Suez. Even George W Bush is on record, with regard to the countries that opposed the war, as saying: 'I know how these people think. I meet with them all the time ... They're not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake.' Those who do, economic success or no, must be the Fall guys."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
