To be a part of this is cool.\u201d Last Saturday, a club record 25,218 fans crammed into arguably the most atmospheric venue in the United States to see the Portland Timbers mark the renovation party with a defeat against in-form MLS leaders LAFC. Yet the most telling evidence of Portland\u2019s thriving soccer ecosystem came the next day. Decked out in red, Thorns supporters of all ages and genders flooded the streets before kick-off and made their way into rejuvenated surroundings, which cost around $85m to complete and have added an extra 4,000 seats to the stadium\u2019s east side. The Thorns had been on the road for the first six games of the NWSL season, and had been sorely missed. A record season-opening home attendance of 19,461 spoke of a genuine longing to see Parsons\u2019 team in action. The Rose City Riveters\u2019 fan group banged the drums, shuffled their dancing feet, and belted out songs for 90 minutes. Forward Midge Purce\u2019s cooly taken first-half double sent the crowd suitably wild. Their match with the Chicago Red Stars felt like top-level soccer should \u2013 atmospheric, lively, and exciting. At the end of the 3-0 win, Thorns players mingled with family on the pitch before signing autographs for young fans. The women\u2019s game continues to grow and evolve, but nowhere makes it come alive like Portland. Ever since they attracted 16,479 for their first NWSL match in 2013, interest has soared. League bosses must wish for similar crowds elsewhere \u2013 the Utah Royals are the only other club generating turnouts over 13,000, while other teams are hovering around 5,000 \u2013 but the front office at Providence Park know how fortunate they are. Mass interest in the beautiful game did not happen accidentally. The lack of an NHL, NFL or MLB franchise in the city certainly helps capture eyeballs in one of the country\u2019s less-saturated sporting market \u2013 the Portland Trail Blazers definitely made a mark during their recent run to the NBA Western Conference finals \u2013 while the the prominence of the University of Portland women\u2019s soccer program has also been instrumental. Nine top players were missing last weekend as they gear up for this month\u2019s World Cup (the Thorns have provided more players than any NWSL roster, while Tobin Heath and Alex Morgan started the final in 2015 for the USWNT as Thorns players), though the excitement wasn\u2019t diluted. \u201cA buzzword which gets used a lot is \u2018authenticity,\u2019 but that\u2019s the core of our brand \u2013 both for the Timbers and the Thorns, who have become one of the most successful women\u2019s team in the world,\u201d says the teams\u2019 owner, Merritt Paulson. \u201cIt\u2019s a DIY ethos and we provide the canvas for the fans. We know what makes it unique. But [the Thorns\u2019 popularity] has been a nice surprise. We never envisaged having 14,000 people come to watch the Thorns, we had expectations of maybe 7,000. We don\u2019t market them as a niche product, we are a high-calibre, professional set-up.\u201d The collaboration with their MLS counterparts, which began in 2012 following the creation of the Thorns, is an integral part of Paulson\u2019s push to create a thriving, progressive soccer community. Timbers favourite Diego Valeri\u2019s daughter is Thorns-obsessed, while both sets of coaches have become close, and swap ideas. This rare cross-pollination \u2013 only the Utah Royals, Orlando Pride and Houston Dash have similar setups with MLS franchises \u2013 is bearing fruit: 20% of Timbers season-ticket holders also have Thorns season tickets, while the figure climbs to 30% the other way around. Two teams have become one. \u201cIt 100% helps having the Timbers around to feed off,\u201d says Thorns captain Emily Menges. \u201cThe whole Timbers team were given Thorns shirts earlier this year and they wear them everywhere \u2013 I\u2019ve seen them around town. We kind of mixed together while the stadium was being redone, and it was great. Our togetherness has an organic feel to it.\u201d Timbers coach Gio Savarese agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete unit, which has to support each other to become successful; it\u2019s not just one particular team and that\u2019s it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want the women, the youth teams, and everyone to be a success. We have to work with each other, to become a family. That is what a club should be. Portland has a very clear identity.\u201d For Parsons, whose coaching career started at Chelsea and took him to Washington DC, before taking in the Pacific Northwest, being the envy of his rivals sits perfectly. \u201cI grew up going to Chelsea games and I thought that was the pinnacle,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I came here and sampled the matchday experience. When I returned to Chelsea afterwards, it felt less special. I became a snob. I thought the atmosphere at Stamford Bridge was horrendous in comparison.\u201d Talk to anyone in the city and you get a sense of the esteem the team is held in. \u201cThe fans are really engaged,\u201d adds Parsons. \u201cWe do the \u2018clap around\u2019 after games and there\u2019s people in their 70s, 80s. Boys, girls, middle-aged. \u201cThere\u2019s this culture, and it\u2019s a shame that I am saying they are special because of this, but the people of Portland want to see females succeed. They\u2019re world-class athletes, fans want to put them on a pedestal like they deserve to be, while knowing they get support from the owner in terms of finance and resources. The fans want to see women treated the way they deserve to be in the top fields of sports or business.\u201d The popularity of both teams has made the job less problematic for Mike Golub, the club\u2019s president of business operations. \u201cWe had been trying to crack the code with Ikea for four or five years on the Timbers side,\u201d says Golub, who worked for the NBA during the roll-out of the WNBA in 1997. \u201cBut they came in as a Thorns sponsor because they wanted to reach a more female audience. Mini Cooper, too. Their success here has been wonderful, but we can\u2019t be complacent. Having the initial fan interest is key and we definitely have struck a chord, especially with millennials. But we have to keep pushing forward.\u201d The startling case of Olivia Moultrie, who turned professional at 13, has made the rest of the world, never mind the country, stand up and take serious notice of what is happening in Portland. Moultrie, burdened with the pressure of becoming the next wonderkid off the block, is still at school, but is training with Parsons\u2019 squad and has already has signed a pro-deal with Nike. \u201cIt\u2019s never been done before,\u201d says Parsons. \u201cPeople may be negative about it because it\u2019s so different. But we always are trying to push and make everything as good as it can be. There\u2019s just something a little different in Portland.\u201d Indeed there is, and long may it continue coming up roses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
