That\u2019s it from me. Thanks for following. Bedlam at BMO Field as Toronto FC cap an incredible season, sealing the third trophy of a domestic treble. Redemption for Altidore, Bradley, Giovinco et al. And that\u2019s the icing on the cake for Toronto as the fans go bananas. Victor Vazquez seals the MLS Cup for the Canadians. 90 min (+2): Some substitutions. For Seattle, Nouhou is on for Joevin Jones; for Toronto, Cheyrou is on for Delgado. Two more minutes of added time. 90 min: Giovinco goes through and goes down in the area but the referee waves play on. 86 min: Toronto\u2019s goalscorer Altidore is off and Nick Hagglund is on. 80 min: MLS has the use of VAR technology. So why was it not used on Altidore\u2019s goal? It turns out it was. Thanks to reader Dennis Verweij, watching the Canadian broadcast, for the email. 79 min: The game has died down a little \u2013 Seattle need something and quick. A video of Altidore\u2019s goal. Some suggestions he may have been offside as the ball was played through. 71 min: Seattle make their first change. Jordan Morris, the USA forward, comes on for Victor Rodriguez. And the dam is finally broken. Toronto finally get their breakthrough and it is through Jozy Altidore, who took so much heat after USA\u2019s failure to make the 2018 World Cup, who comes up with the goods. 64 min: Frei yet again comes to Seattle\u2019s rescue with a brilliant diving save to deny Giovinco. How long can Frei keep this up? He is playing out of his skin. 63 min: Toronto win their ninth corner but nothing comes of it. 60 min: Michael Bradley pounces on a loose ball with a long-range volley that Frei keeps out with his body. 57 min: Some controversy as Altidore is held back outside the area before Leerdam slides in on Morrow inside the area. No foul, no penalty. 53min: Seattle have done nothing up front thus far. If they are relying on Frei once again in a penalty shoot-out they really need to make a switch soon. 52min: Giovinco is fouled and he takes the free-kick but it\u2019s way, way over the bar. 48 min: And the second half begins as the first half ends, with Toronto in charge. Steven Beitashour hits a long effort over the bar. \u201cGood day Bob,\u201d writes Travis Giblin. \u201cJust to clarify, the weather doesn\u2019t suck everywhere in North America right now. I\u2019m a Canadian currently in Mexico where it\u2019s 30 Celsius.\u201d Very happy for you Travis. I\u2019m in NYC where it is freezing. 46 min: The second half begins... Here\u2019s a picture of Stefan Frei making one of his many saves in this game. Can he win the MLS Cup MVP trophy again? ESPN\u2019s Taylor Twellman interviewed MLS Commissioner Don Garber earlier this week. Garber says the prospect of the Columbus Crew moving to Austin, Texas, is a \u201cunique situation\u201d, possibly allaying the fears of many MLS fans that their team could move, too. Two words: Stefan Frei. 44 min: Nearly an own-goal for Seattle after Joevin Jones puts a wild boot on Justin Morrrow\u2019s cross from the left. It could have gone anywhere and, fortunately for the Sounders, it flies to safety. 41 min: It\u2019s Groundhog Day and deja vu all over again. Frei with another big save for Seattle, denying Victor Vasquez. Keep your emails coming as this game is not living up to billing thus far... One for our British viewers. \u201cWhat I want to know is whether we\u2019ll see Dempsey Make Peace with Bono,\u201d emails one reader. (There was a British TV crime drama called Dempsey and Makepeace in the Eighties). 35 min: Stefan Frei keeps Seattle in the game again after a fizzing effort from Marco Delgado. 30 min: A shot on target from Seattle in the MLS Cup final, a momentous occasion. Why, you ask. Joevin Jones\u2019s effort was the Sounders\u2019 first in 150 minutes of the last two MLS Cup finals (they did not have any last year in regulation). Daniel Stauss emails again, latching onto the Bono U2 puns. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a Beautiful Day in Seattle if, by the whistle, Bono Still Hasn\u2019t Found What He\u2019s Looking For (an MLS Cup). Of course, keepers are known for their Mysterious Ways...\u201d It goes on but I\u2019ll leave it there. The Toronto keeper is called Alex Bono if you were wondering. 26 min: A nice chip there from Jozy Altidore, just outside the area, but it comes to nothing, the running theme of this game: Toronto dominance but a struggle with the end product. 23 min: Another shot from Giovinco... another save from Frei, who tips the ball over the bar. 20 min: A free-kick for Sebastian Giovinco, his speciality. But it\u2019s too far out and his effort goes straight into the wall. Toronto remain on top though. Another weather email, this time from Mike MacKenzie in London, Canada. \u201cMost Canadians understand both Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures although Celsius has been used in Canada for a few decades. Of course, we get US weather reports with temps in Fahrenheit. \u201cAll Canadians understand the wind chill factor which was invented by a Canadian. Regardless, it is still rather cold to be playing a final in December in Canada (or the northern US for that matter).\u201d Why are talking so much about the weather and not the game? Well it is scoreless... 16 min: Toronto keep pushing and Morrow is given offside when a replay indicates he is not. Frei saves his effort anyway. \u201cWill Bono in goal give Toronto the Edge on the big stage?\u201d asks Justin Kavanagh. \u201cSorry! I\u2019d get my coat but as it\u2019s freezing here in North America, I already have it on. I agree with Rob O: December is not a month for soccer in Canada or the US.\u201d 10 min: Huge save by Seattle keeper Stefan Frei to deny Jonathan Osorio... and then Giovinco hits the ball just wide from right of the area. 8 min: Sebastian Giovinco did not have a shot on target in last year\u2019s MLS Cup final. He\u2019s had his first one here. But it was weak and straight at the keeper. \u201cWhat is this 34F/20F you speak of?\u201d asks Kevin Smith. \u201cThe spacing between games in the play-offs makes as much sense as the Fahrenheit system.\u201d 2 min: Early pressure from Toronto and Drew Moor goes close for the home side with a clear header over the bar following a corner. He was unmarked. Should have done better. The Seattle Sounders get us under way. Will it be revenge (for Toronto) or repeat (for Seattle)? Will VAR come into play? Let\u2019s find out... Two national anthems today: the Star Spangled Banner followed by O Canada. No protests whatsoever here. Another email. \u201cI have always wondered why the MLS drags its play-offs and plays the final in December. It loses all momentum,\u201d writes Rob O. Do you agree? It\u2019s currently 34F at BMO Field but it feels more like 20F due to the wind chill, apparently. Brrr! Bit of a laboured on-field bit there from the usually excellent Taylor Twellman on ESPN. Not sure that really worked. Toronto have switched from a back three, which has proved so successful this season, to a back four. \u201cIt\u2019s a big gamble from Greg Vanney,\u201d says ESPN\u2019s Kasey Keller. Here is the prize that Toronto FC and Seattle Sounders are playing for. An email from one Daniel Stauss: \u201cLoving the Sounders lineup. I\u2019m sad (but not surprised) to see El Corazon out of the central midfield, but in Schmetzer we trust. Bruin was a monster in the series against Houston, and Rodriguez was the best under the radar pickup in the league this year. \u201cMy biggest question going into this match, what will Dempsey, Bradley and Altidore have to say to each other after the epic choke that was the WCQ? Will they just do that shrug-and-avert-your-eyes thing? Will the BMO crowd give Clint a hard time? Prepare the popcorn!\u201d If Harry Shipp scores the winner for Seattle Sounders, it will begin a week of serious festivities for the player. The players are on the field and getting ready for kick-off. Toronto FC Bono; Beitashour, Moor, Mavinga, Morrow; Bradley, Vazquez, Delgado, Osorio; Giovinco, Altidore. Seattle Sounders Frei; Jones, Marshall, Torres, Leerdam; Svensson, Roldan; Rodriguez, Dempsey, Lodeiro; Bruin. On to today\u2019s MLS Cup final (kick-off is scheduled to be 4.30pm ET), victory over Toronto would make Seattle just the fourth team in league history to become back-to-back MLS Cup champions. DC United won the first two titles in league history (1996 and 1997), Houston Dynamo won consecutive titles in 2006-07 and LA Galaxy went back-to-back in 2011-12. Earlier today, meanwhile, incumbent Sunil Gulati \u2013 in Toronto for a 2026 World Cup bid press conference \u2013 said he has officially withdrawn from the US Soccer presidential race, days after announcing he would not seek re-election. \u201cI haven\u2019t endorsed anybody, and I haven\u2019t said I have a preferred candidate,\u201d Gulati told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ll certainly think about [endorsing a candidate], but I haven\u2019t made a decision yet. I don\u2019t think there will be [nine] candidates come February, and I don\u2019t think all the candidates will get the requisite nominations.\u201d There are nine candidates in the race, including controversial former US women\u2019s goalkeeper Hope Solo. In a twist, former USWNT player Julie Foudy tweeted earlier today of Solo: \u201cI am hearing from multiple sources that Hope Solo does not have even one official nomination. She has until Tuesday to secure three.\u201d How about that. MLS Commissioner Don Garber gave his traditional \u201cState of the League\u201d press conference on Friday in Toronto. Most notably, Garber said it was \u201cconceivable\u201d that David Beckham\u2019s beleaguered Miami franchise, which is still to be finalized despite being announced in February 2014, could fall down in the pecking order of expansion teams to be invited into the league. Two new franchises, from finalists Sacramento, Nashville, Cincinnati and Detroit, are due to be announced next week. \u201cIt is the most complicated in any market that we\u2019ve experienced, at least in my 18 years,\u201d Garber said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard on trying to find a local owner for David Beckham. I feel confident that that will come together, so I continue to say that we want Miami in the league. It\u2019s a large market, a gateway city. There are a lot of values to us having a team down there and I\u2019m very confident that we\u2019ll get something done.\u201d Hello and welcome to the 2017 MLS Cup final between heavy favourites Toronto FC and defending champions, the Seattle Sounders. Today\u2019s game in frosty Toronto is a rematch of last year\u2019s final which the Sounders won on penalties after a goalless 120 minutes. Toronto, for their part, are excited to have \u201canother crack\u201d at Seattle, according to midfielder Michael Bradley. \u201cThis was all we wanted,\u201d he added. Toronto foward Jozy Altidore is fit to play despite nursing a hurt right ankle while Jordan Morris is likely to make the Sounders squad after returning from a hamstring injury in the Western Conference final against Houston Dynamo. Seattle midfielder and captain Osvaldo Alonso is out, though. The biggest factor could be the weather: temperatures are expected around the freezing mark around kick-off, with a 40% chance of snow flurries. The orange ball awaits. Bob will be here soon. In the meantime, read why Toronto FC are confident of finally fulfilling their promise after last year\u2019s heartache against today\u2019s opponents, the Seattle Sounders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
