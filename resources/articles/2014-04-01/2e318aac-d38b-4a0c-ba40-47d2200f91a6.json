Albion have three fixtures left to play after Saturday's home game against West Ham, which they head into in 16th place with 33 points. They are three points clear of the relegation zone and have a game in hand over the three sides directly below them. And Mel, who arrived in English football as the club's head coach in January, has been buoyed by two wins and a draw in the past five games and believes that form puts his side in a good position to stay up. \"This was the idea that I had of the Premier League \u2013 that it is the most competitive league in the world. \"Any team is capable of beating any other team \u2013 look at Sunderland, who drew at Manchester City and then won at Chelsea. What we really have clear is that we need four points from the last four games. If we consider that West Ham [who are 12th] are safe with 37 \u2013 that's also what we need. Last year 36 was actually the cut-off point. I think 37 will be enough to keep us up. Saturday is the final.\" Ramires accepts four-game ban Ramires has accepted a four-game ban after being charged with violent conduct by the Football Association following an off-the-ball incident that was not seen by the match officials but caught on video against Sunderland at Stamford Bridge on Saturday 19 April. The ban includes three matches for this offence plus an additional game for his sending off at Villa Park last month. Bolton rename ground Macron Stadium The home of Bolton will be renamed the Macron Stadium in July as part of a new sponsorship deal between the Sky Bet Championship club and the Italian sportswear company. Wanderers announced on Thursday morning that Macron had agreed to become their stadium naming rights partners and kit providers as part of an initial four-year agreement. It means that the club's home ground will change its name for the first time since it opened as the Reebok Stadium in 1997. Rangers legend Jardine dies Sir Alex Ferguson has joined the tributes being made after the death at 65 of the former Rangers defender Sandy Jardine. Jardine, a European Cup Winners' Cup-winning full-back, was among the Ibrox side's most decorated servants and won 38 Scotland caps. He was diagnosed with cancer 18 months ago. Ferguson, a former Ibrox colleague, said: \"Sandy was a noble and courageous man. The respect he is held in at Rangers is immense. He was one of the greatest players ever to wear the jersey. To Shona and family, we express our sympathy and sadness.\" Rangers' manager, Ally McCoist, said: \"There have been many great names associated with Rangers Football Club in our 142-year history and Sandy is a Rangers legend in every sense of the word. We are all devastated with the news he has passed away. We have lost a great man today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
