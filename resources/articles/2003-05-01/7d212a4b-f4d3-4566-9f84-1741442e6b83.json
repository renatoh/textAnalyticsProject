One Christmas Eve, aged 19, he sat watching a BBC classic adaptation with his mother and stepfather (whose name he carries), the only father he had ever known since his own father moved away when he was two. It was the opening episode of Great Expectations, where Pip slips out at night to meet Magwitch the convict in the cemetery: a scary, atmospheric scene, prisoner in chains appearing from behind the gravestone - and Morpurgo's mother clutched his arm and said: \"Oh my God, Michael, that's your father.\" \"It was extraordinary,\" says Morpurgo, a tall man wearing his lucky soft-red shirt. \"I've never forgotten it.\" His father, still alive, is a Canadian actor. \"It was all rather strange - the first time I see him, he's a convict - but then I met him for real, five or six years later.\" His father made the initial contact, thinking the boys, in their 20s, would be ready. \"It was very stiff, drinking cups of tea, short intakes of breath to start with. But he's a very kind man, very amiable. The whole business of moving away, leaving other people to get on with their lives, was, I think, essentially out of kindness,\" says Morpurgo. \"Now, it's rather nice to know a father without there being any baggage: he's your dad, but you haven't had all that bringing-up. It's a clear relationship.\" Relations with his stepfather were more complicated - a man stringent in his judgments, he was disappointed that the children were not academic successes. Morpurgo feels strongly that his natural father's decision to be absent from their lives was made out of respect for his mother's choices. His father only asked that his two sons keep his name, which is Bridge, but the children were brought up as Morpurgo. \"My father was not mentioned. There was this great pretence of us all being one family - my brother, myself and my two half-siblings - which I found very difficult,\" he says. \"I was aware that I had a different father, but I was discouraged from asking questions about it; it was seen as upsetting to my mother, and disloyal to my stepfather.\" His mother and stepfather are both dead now. When I ask whether his father contributed financially, he responds with that instant and typical defence of the parent by children whose grown-ups have split. \"No,\" says this soft-spoken man, now nearing 60 and a grandfather, \"and I don't think anybody expected him to.\" One evening, many years after meeting his father, his own choices made, Morpurgo was walking along the meadows round his Devon farmhouse, when a great, looming shape appeared darkly from the riverbank. \"Hullo,\" said this second, suddenly appearing figure in Morpurgo's life. \"Are you the person who has just started the project for city kids?\" - these were not necessarily the first words you would expect to hear from the country's leading poet (and soon to be laureate). The man, Ted Hughes, was Morpurgo's neighbour, a great angler as well as a poet, and knew (as all the locals did) of the scheme set up by Michael and his wife to bring inner-city children to Devon to experience life on a farm. The two began to meet regularly, for dinner most weeks, and Hughes became a mentor to Morpurgo. \"He read a book of mine when I was struggling to find my voice,\" says Morpurgo, \"and he said a lovely thing to me. He said: 'It's a fine book, Michael, a fine book. But you're going to write an even finer one.' \" At one of their last fireside chats before Hughes's death, Morpurgo broached an idea he wanted Hughes to support: the creation of a children's laureate. Now the story has come full circle, for this month Morpurgo has been made the new laureate. While speculation over the poet laureate's appointment fills gossip columns for months, and then makes front-page news, the announcement of the children's laureate - which carries a \u00a310,000 bursary - appeared on the inside pages of a couple of the broadsheets. I say to Morpurgo that I don't think most children even know they have a laureate. Impeccably polite, he responds by saying how he will tackle the job:\"I feel the thing has come round to me for a purpose.\" He plans to use it to counter the government's literacy strategy, which he sees as terribly reductive. He will be touring teacher-training colleges, schools and libraries, simply telling stories. From his mother's bedtime reading, Morpurgo learned to love poetry. Then, at school, he was taught to hate reading and writing, and he believes the over-testing of children is causing the same damage to a new generation. Having seen Morpurgo speak to an audience of children and keep them gripped for an hour, I for one can vouch that here is a laureate with the imaginative force to wrest children from the numbness of a dreary education. It is Morpurgo's time to loom large in the lives of others. Michael Morpurgo's most recent novel The Sleeping Sword, is published by Egmont Books, at \u00a34.99"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
