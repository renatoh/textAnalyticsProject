Ole! Ole! Fiver scours the morning papers, which he does while munching his breakfast paella and waving a red rag at the family bull, his comical moustache grows in relation to the size of the rumour he reads. Even so, his neighbours were shocked today when Juan Miguel left the house sporting bigger handlebars than a La Vuelta de Espana-winning bike. Why? Because Arsene Wenger was being linked to Real Madrid and David Beckham to Barcelona, that's why. According to Spanish daily ABC, Real have offered a \u00a33m-a-year deal to entice Wenger to the Bernebeu, following their meeting in a private room in a Paris hotel last Friday. (A meeting which, incidentally, Madrid president Florentino I've-not-been-to-Paris-for-a-year-and-a-half Perez denies going to, despite witnesses to the contrary.) But no sooner had ABC gone to press (and Juan Miguel Manuel Ole! Ole! Ole! Fiver's moustache turned all Merv Hughes) than a gruff-voiced Arsenal source let slip to London's London Evening Standard that they were \"not perturbed\" at the shock revelation/tedious silly-season story - because Wenger had informed them of his secret Madrid talks beforehand. Still, there was plenty for JMMOOOF to get his teeth into - especially the news that Arsenal, according to the Standard, \"didn't know the specifics\" of their manager's talks with Madrid. By now, however, our marvellously moustachioed Spanish cousin had been diverted to a second shock revelation/ tedious silly-season story linking David Beckham with Barcelona. Yes, really. According to Spanish daily Marca, Juan Laporte - a leading candidate to be the next Barca president - has struck a deal with Manchester United giving him first option of buying Becks for 36m euros if he wins. And with Becks' current salary - \u00a32.4m after tax - being the same as Michael Reizeger's, Barca would happily offer him a couple of million a year extra to clinch the deal. Whatever, our Spanish cousin surely won't be trimming his whiskers any time soon. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We are not a good enough team to make mistakes and get away with it\" - Scotland international Gary Naysmith needn't have bothered opening his mouth, agreed? THE RUMOUR MILL'S BIG NIGHT OUT An evening out on the tiles with the Fiver's good friend The Rumour Mill has its moments. On the plus side, Rumour Mill is always on the ball when it comes to knowing which hostelry has just started stocking Scrumpy Jack. On the minus side, he's forever speculating about the price of a bitter top and a bag of nuts. Then there are the players. They all know Rumour Mill - and, by God, some of them fear the man - but depending on how much they need the headlines, they either treat him like tomorrow's pay cheque or last week's one-night stand. Take yesterday evening. Rumour Mill's eagle eye had spotted Blackburn starlet Damien Duff hastily leaving Theme Pub O'Fiver's theme pub, and decided to pester him about his move to Liverpool, or possibly Manchester United. But Duff was having none of it. \"Anything I say now there is an angle on it,\" he complained, as Rumour Mill wondered whether this meant he would in fact be leaving Ewood Park. \"I made one small comment and it was twisted out of all proportion, blown all over the papers and television.\" Before Rumour Mill could wish him all the best in Merseyside/Manchester, Duff added: \"I am truly in the dark about what might be happening. I am happy where I am at the minute and that's a Blackburn Rovers player.\" \"He's going,\" insisted Rumour Mill with a needlessly conspiratorial nod and a wink, before grabbing the Fiver by the elbow, and hurrying him down a dark side street. \"Djibril Cisse,\" he explained. \"Won't leave me alone. Obsessed with moving to Liverpool.\" But it takes more than the absence of two renowned journalists to shut Cisse up. \"I would like to go,\" he announced to no one in particular, \"but if [Auxerre] don't want me out, I won't make a fuss about it.\" Grabbing a handy megaphone, Cisse made a fuss. \"It's not a secret that I'd like to go.\" Shinning his way up a lamp-post, he added, \"I'd love to go to Liverpool,\" just in case. \"Staying put,\" declared Rumour Mill, donning a wig and mask and disappearing into the evening gloom. THE RUMOUR MILL Alex Ferguson is prepared to offer his old mucker Steve McClaren \u00a36m for Gareth Southgate. Birmingham want a new goalkeeper, and any one of Nigel Martyn, David Seaman, Roy Carroll or Thomas Sorenson will do. Steve Bruce has denied an interest in either - \"It's a load of nonsense, absolute rubbish\" - but when did you last believe a manager when it comes to transfer rumours? (Or, indeed, us, but that's another matter entirely.) Newcastle are planning a \u00a31.5m bid for Ipswich striker Darren Bent. NEWS IN BRIEF The EC will rule the Premiership's collective television deal uncompetitive unless more of its proceeds go to football's grassroots. The commission is understood to believe that the way TV rights for Premiership football matches are sold as a job-lot benefits only the top clubs. And they're paid how much to come up with conclusions like this? Uefa has warned England fans they will not be afraid to hoof Sven-Goran Eriksson's men out of international competition if the current cycle of violence continues into next summer. \"I really hope we never have to come to the kind of decision we made in 1985 where we banned teams from European competition because it is not the purpose of our work,\" said outgoing Uefa suit Gerhard Aigner, \"but if extreme measures are needed to protect people we are prepared to take the steps required.\" Sunderland have received a \u00a3350,000 windfall from Wolverhampton Wanderers' ascension to the Premiership. Wolves play-off final victory over Sheffield United activated clauses negotiated as part of the deals which took Alex Rae and Paul Butler from the Stadium of Light to Molineux. Charlton have also benefited, with the Addicks set to pocket \u00a3150,000 as part of a clause agreed when Shaun Newton moved to Molineux for \u00a3850,000. Franz Beckenbauer has hinted Bayern Munich deliberately threw a Bundesliga match 36 years ago to ensure rivals TSV 1860 Munich did not win the title. The row revolves around a late-season 5-2 defeat of Bayern by Eintracht Braunschweig in the 1966-67 campaign which eventually handed Braunschweig the title, two points ahead of TSV. \"We lost 5-2 in Braunschweig and that suited us,\" said Beckenbauer. \"I'm not saying that we lost on purpose but our resistance was limited to the minimum.\" Saadi Gadafy, son of Libyan leader Muammar, has been named among 24 players for Libya's two African Nations Cup qualifiers in Botswana and the Democratic Republic of Congo next month. TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV1: Big Cup Final Live (7.30pm) \"I'm about to move back to England from abroad but I don't know where I want to live,\" snivelled John Herman yesterday. \"Or, come to think of it, what sort of job I should get.\" Foolishly, he invited you to decide, with the only proviso being that he wasn't keen on Swindon, Slough or Liverpool. World Football (3.35am) \"I have a solution to John Herman's predicament,\" writes Yaron Winterstein, toying with what looks much like a whip from here. \"I shall employ him and his singular task will be to do my job. In its entirety. Copa Libertadores (4.05am) \"As for accommodation, given the long hours, early starts and the fact that I won't be paying him but one penny, may I suggest a park bench in close proximity to the office. I await his suitable application.\" Five: Dutch Football (1.15am) \"Is John available from mid-August?\" asks David Gallagher, suggesting he could throw a little work his way before weaving seamlessly in an old theme. \"If so, he could always come to Milton Keynes and be Franchise FC's new mascot.\" Argentinian Football (2.45am) Realising no predicament would call for such a desperate measure as that, John Kay suggests an alternative path. \"I'm afraid I can't offer any advice on where to live,\" he admits, \"not that it matters, seeing as all the high streets in the country are utterly identical nowadays. Sky Sports 1: Futbol Mundial (6.30pm &amp; 11.30pm) \"But I can suggest the army, as I hear they're struggling to recruit at the moment.\" And what, readers, could be more appealing than the prospect of a short, shaven-skulled sociopath in big boots barking orders at you all day and every day, eh? Eh? EH? Radio 5 Live: Sport On Five With Ian Payne (7pm) Damn those flashbacks. Anyway, finally today, Paul Owens strikes a cheap blow below the belt. TalkSport: Football First (7pm) \"Can I be the only person to recognise that John's sloth-like attitude to work will get him at least a second interview for a job at the Fiver?\" Newstalk 106 (www.newstalk106.ie): Off the Ball with Ger Gilroy No you're not, Paul, and that's a stab so far wide of the mark, it could have been ghost-written by Mr Em himself.
