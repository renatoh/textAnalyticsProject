The women, both outspoken critics of the Israeli government, have faced charges of antisemitism since arriving in Congress last month. The controversy began with a tweet on Sunday night, when Omar responded to a journalist who accused the Republican minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, of \u201cattacking free speech\u201d by targeting Omar and Tlaib, who is Palestinian American, for expressing a divergent view on Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins, baby,\u201d Omar responded, a reference to Benjamin Franklin, whose face is on the $100 bill. That tweet generated a response from a Jewish journalist who asked Omar who she believed was \u201cpaying American politicians to be pro-Israel\u201d. The congresswoman replied: \u201cAIPAC,\u201d referring to influential pro-Israel lobby group, the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee. Aipac does not contribute to political campaigns though there is a long tradition of lawmakers from both parties attending its annual conference and congressional trips to Israel. In her own statement, Omar said: \u201cWe have to always be willing to step back and think though criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me for my identity. This is why I unequivocally apologize. \u201cAt the same time,\u201d she added, \u201cI reaffirm the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics, whether it be Aipac, the NRA or the fossil fuel industry. It\u2019s gone on too long and we must be willing to address it.\u201d Another senior Democrat, the House judiciary committee chairman, Jerrold Nadler, called the tweets \u201cdeeply disappointing and disturbing\u201d and said Omar had appeared to \u201ctraffic in old antisemitic tropes about Jews and money\u201d. Lawmakers should debate the \u201crelative influence of a particular organization on our country\u2019s policy-making process\u201d, Nadler said, but they must also be \u201cextremely careful not to tread into the waters of antisemitism or any other form of prejudice or hate\u201d. The House foreign affairs chairman, Eliot Engel, like Nadler a Democrat from New York, said it was \u201cshocking\u201d for a member of Congress to make such a comment. Omar serves on Engel\u2019s committee. The House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California said it was \u201cnever acceptable to give voice to, or repeat, antisemitic smears\u201d. \u201cThat goes for Rep Omar, and it also goes for Republicans who have trafficked in antisemitic attacks on George Soros and others,\u201d he said. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) accused Omar of promoting the \u201cugly antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews have an outsized influence over politics\u201d. \u201cThese tweets are part of a disturbing pattern of behavior that must end,\u201d said the ADL chief executive, Jonathan Greenblatt. \u201cThe congresswoman needs to understand that these comments promote dangerous stereotypes and are hurtful to her Jewish constituents and Jewish Americans throughout the country.\u201d Omar recently apologized for comments on Israel including a tweet in which she said it had \u201chypnotized the world\u201d. Regretting her \u201cunfortunate word choice\u201d, she said: \u201cWhat is important to me is that people recognize that there\u2019s a difference between criticizing a military action by a government that has exercised really oppressive policies and being offensive or attack-y to particular people of faith.\u201d Jewish House Democrats are gathering signatures on a letter, first reported by the Washington Post and seen by the Guardian, that calls on Pelosi, Hoyer and other senior figures to \u201creiterate our rejection of antisemitism and our continued support for the state of Israel\u201d. Some progressive activists and writers claim to see a double standard. \u201cWhy is it OK to talk about Saudi lobbies, and Saudis buying Trump, and Saudi-first policies, why is it not Islamophobic to say all of that, but it\u2019s antisemitic when it comes to Israel?\u201d the Intercept columnist Mehdi Hasan wrote in a lengthy Twitter thread. In a piece for The Forward entitled \u201cNo, Ilhan Omar Is Not Anti-Semitic For Calling Out Aipac\u201d, the columnist Peter Feld wrote: \u201cThe problem is, all lobbies, by definition, are designed to exert secret control over policy, using money. That\u2019s what they do.\u201d Omar is part of small but vocal group of lawmakers who are critical of the Israeli government and its policies. Some, including Omar and Tlaib, have endorsed the BDS movement, which stands for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions and seeks to put economic pressure on Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and to ensure \u201cfull equality\u201d for Arab-Palestinian citizens. Republicans have seized on such division within the opposition party. On Monday J Street, a progressive pro-Israel group, said it was \u201cdismayed and frustrated by the ongoing war of words between lawmakers\u201d and said \u201coverheated, ill-considered and reductive attacks, playing out on social media and in the press, [have] failed to address these issues with the nuance, sensitivity and seriousness that they deserve\u201d. Referring to controversial instances in the 2016 Republican primary, it added: \u201cElected officials must be extremely aware that tropes about Jewish money and political influence have been used for centuries to target and stigmatize our community.\u201d Donald Trump, whose campaign came under fire for instances of alleged antisemitism, has received staunch support from Israel for policies including the recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. At home, however, he has faced criticism for refusing to condemn neo-Nazis after a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned deadly. Earlier this month the Republican-controlled Senate passed a bill that would undermine the BDS movement. The measure passed by 77-23. Several Democratic presidential candidates and potential contenders opposed it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
