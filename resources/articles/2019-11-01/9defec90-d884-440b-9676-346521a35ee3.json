Wales mustered three points from their opening three qualifying matches but after victory over Hungary on Tuesday they are unbeaten in six matches and Wales are heading to a third major tournament finals. Many supporters were sceptical about Giggs\u2019s appointment last year, unconvinced the former Manchester United winger was the best candidate to replace Chris Coleman, who led Wales to a Euro 2016 semi-final, but Allen feels the decision has been vindicated. \u201cThe ambition and target was to get to the Euros,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe would have loved to have done it more easily but beggars can\u2019t be choosers. Any way you get there is huge success. A lot of people are going to have to eat their words with some of the criticism which has been thrown at us.\u201d Giggs credited Coleman for \u201cshowing the way\u201d and Allen said qualification should diminish any lingering doubts over the manager. \u201cYes [he has had flak], but he has delivered, simple as that. He came in off the back of a great manager who had huge success. It was always going to be tough but he has got us there. I think questions have been asked of everything really \u2013 selection, tactics \u2013 but nine times out of 10 he has got it right. That is one of the big reasons we have made it.\u201d Aaron Ramsey turned in a near-perfect performance against Hungary, scoring both goals, and it proved an equally special occasion for those who were not part of Euro 2016, such as the Bournemouth pair Harry Wilson, who attended the tournament as a fan, and Chris Mepham, who was then playing for Brentford B. \u201cI was on holiday in Greece,\u201d said Mepham, who made his Wales debut in March last year. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be in a position where I\u2019d be going to a major tournament. Even in the summer with the two games we had it made it very difficult. I think a lot of people lost hope.\u201d Ramsey believes Wales are capable of going deep into the knockout stages next summer. Ramsey missed Wales\u2019s semi-final defeat by Portugal three years ago because of suspension and the Juventus midfielder feels as if he has unfinished business with the competition. \u201cIt was obviously a disappointing ending to the Euros for me by missing out on the semi-final,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I have the opportunity to go out there and express myself again and hopefully we can have another successful run. To do back-to-back Euros is something special. It was very disappointing not to make the [2018] World Cup but we learned from that experience to bring it back here, and to win in the manner that we did was a nice experience.\u201d Wales will discover their group-stage fate when the Euro 2020 draw is made in Bucharest on 30 November. Giggs\u2019s side will be drawn into either Group A, where matches will be played in Rome and Baku, or Group B, where matches will be played in Copenhagen and St Petersburg. Group B will comprise Belgium, Russia, Denmark and either Finland or Wales. Asked about possibly playing for his country in Italy next summer, Ramsey replied: \u201cI\u2019m enjoying my time over there at the moment, so that would be nice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
