Beto O\u2019Rourke, whose campaign ended with a whimper on Friday night, was soon mocked by the US president. \u201cOh no,\u201d Trump wrote, \u201cBeto just dropped out of race for President despite him saying he was \u2018born for this\u2019. I don\u2019t think so!\u201d With his usual blunt branding ability, Trump had zeroed in on a Vanity Fair interview that O\u2019Rourke gave on the eve of entering the race \u2013 and from which he never quite recovered. \u201cI want to be in it,\u201d the former Texas congressman told the magazine in March. \u201cMan, I\u2019m just born to be in it, and want to do everything I humanly can for this country at this moment.\u201d With a shoot by the celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz, the Vanity Fair spread gave many the impression of a white male vanity project. And O\u2019Rourke \u2013 who later described the cover and his choice of words as a mistake \u2013 did little to dispel that during a campaign in which he livestreamed himself having a haircut. At 47 and with a young family, Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke had been billed as a new Robert Kennedy, a fresh and dynamic figure of hope who could work across the aisle. He was urged to run for president by many Democrats, including Barack Obama alumni, inspired by his narrow Senate loss last year in the Republican stronghold of Texas. O\u2019Rourke had visited every county in the state, raised a record $80m from donors across the country and used social media and livestreaming to connect directly with voters. A speech about racial injustice went viral. His defeat by the incumbent Republican Ted Cruz by just three percentage points was seen as a moral victory. In his concession speech, O\u2019Rourke told an adoring crowd: \u201cI\u2019m so fucking proud of you guys.\u201d But the swearing, leaping on tables and social media antics that appeared charming against Cruz, a liberal b\u00eate noire, became grating when O\u2019Rourke was up against fellow Democrats. Even before entering the race, there was a narcissistic blog: \u201cHave been stuck lately. In and out of a funk. Maybe if I get moving, on the road, meet people, learn about what\u2019s going on where they live, have some adventure, go where I don\u2019t know and I\u2019m not known, it\u2019ll clear my head, reset, I\u2019ll think new thoughts, break out of the loops I\u2019ve been stuck in.\u201d O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign launch video in March featured him sitting on a sofa and talking while his wife, Amy, sat mute gazing at him. And as the campaign went on, he failed to articulate a coherent vision, beyond his own celebrity, to stand out from the crowd. A CNN town hall in May attracted an average of just 714,000 viewers. His debate performances appeared unfocused and insubstantial: in June he was bested by his fellow Texan Juli\u00e1n Castro on immigration. The money ebbed away. He had raised $9.4m during his first two weeks of campaigning but, by the end of June, was spending more than he was taking in. Perhaps most importantly and infuriatingly, O\u2019Rourke came up against a younger, smarter version of himself: Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a military veteran who spoke more fluently, offered crisper policy prescriptions and stole O\u2019Rourke\u2019s thunder \u2013 as well as many of his potential voters. The pair clashed in recent weeks, including in a televised debate, with O\u2019Rourke accusing Buttigieg of pandering to focus groups while he concentrated on doing the right thing. But it was the city mayor who surged to the top tier of the polls while the former US congressman fell away. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign flickered back to life late on in tragic circumstances. After a gunman opened fire at a Walmart in his hometown of El Paso, killing 22 people, he seized the issue of gun violence, vowing to take assault weapons away from existing owners. At a debate in September, he said: \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d But it gifted an attack line to Republicans. O\u2019Rourke also began lashing out at fellow Democrats, claiming that the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, had achieved \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d on gun control. He was in danger of becoming a liability to the party rather than an asset. For that reason, Democrats will probably be more relieved than Republicans to see the back of Beto."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
