Surrounded by a ring of mountains, the Remarkables, the scenery is truly stunning. It is also deemed the adventure capital of the world with its bungee jumping, white-water rafting, jet-boating, zorbing (rolling down a hill inside a giant inflatable ball), skydiving, abseiling and hang-gliding. Facing Brett Lee on a greentop without a helmet is kids' stuff by comparison. The England team are probably barred from trying out the more extreme activities but the sheer beauty of the place is a distraction and one that needs to be overcome if the last phase of their tour is not to get off to a similar start to that in Hamilton a few weeks ago. Then, newly arrived in New Zealand after weeks in India, the players were like dogs unleashed in a butcher's shop. They lost to Northern Districts in a warm-up and conceded the first two one-day internationals to New Zealand before they were able to refocus. Tomorrow, with half a dozen newcomers replacing the one-day returnees, they face Otago in the first of two first-class matches - the other is in Christchurch next week - before consecutive Tests in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland. As was the case with the limited-overs games, there is little time to assess form and get things right. They need to come out of the blocks fast. Whether or not Queenstown proves an adequate venue remains to be seen. With this match the town provides New Zealand with its 59th first-class ground. The pitch, therefore, is an unknown quantity at the top level and remained so yesterday as torrential rain fell all morning and for some of the afternoon, giving way to sunshine only later. England would be entitled to believe they have no cause for concern because all the facilities, from practice pitches to the standard of opposition in the one-day warm-ups, has been first-rate. All the recent arrivals - Mark Butcher and Mark Ramprakash, who was pacing the floor yesterday with the arrival of a baby imminent at home, Usman Afzaal, Jimmy Ormond, Richard Dawson and Warren Hegg - will get a game to ensure they get into the swing of things. Several players are unavailable in any case, Nasser Hussain because he has been sent away for a spot of R&amp;R with his wife and nine-month-old son, Michael Vaughan because he is recovering from the partial dislocation of his right shoulder incurred during the one-dayer in Auckland. Marcus Trescothick will lead the side in Hussain's absence but the Somerset opener would almost certainly have played in any case after his indifferent round of one-day internationals. Craig White needs all the cricket he can get, as does Andy Caddick. Graham Thorpe and either Matthew Hoggard or Andy Flintoff will complete the picture. If Hegg's inclusion has much to do with giving the newcomers match practice it is still one in the eye for James Foster, who began the British winter as a young man with a bright future but is ending it as yet another apparently found wanting. If Hussain and the coach Duncan Fletcher were certain that Foster was their man then, as someone who has not kept wicket for more than a fortnight and who remains desperately inexperienced, he would play here. Instead the door is ajar for Hegg. A competent display and he could pencil his name in for the Christchurch Test. \u00b7 Darren Gough is battling to be fit for the new season after picking up a knee injury in England's final one-dayer in Dunedin. \"Hopefully it'll be nothing,\" he said after his 27-hour flight home, \"but it feels a bit worse than a twist.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
