She told a parliamentary inquiry into privacy and media intrusion that she would meet Sir Christopher Meyer, the new chairman of the press complaints commission, next week to discuss his plans for reform. \"There are a number of areas in which I think the PCC could look at strengthening it position,\" Ms Jowell told the culture and media select committee chaired by Gerald Kaufman MP. \"The PCC should look at the case for acting more proactively.\" The culture secretary referred to the recent example of the families of British servicemen and women in Plymouth, who complained they were being doorstepped by national newspaper journalists. In a recent article the PCC code of ethics committee chairman, Les Hinton, said the issue of avoiding intrusion upon the grief-stricken was a daily difficulty for reporters everywhere and this was one area where the press had an excellent record. \"In terms of public confidence then the capacity and willingness to act proactively is something they should look at,\" said Ms Jowell. She also suggested there should be \"some kind of independent scrutiny\" of the PCC's process. However, she emphasised this was \"not a proxy\" for government intervention in the PCC. \"They should look at opening up the way in which they advertise their membership - for the commissioners and appointments at every level in the body,\" Ms Jowell added. She also said the role of lay members within the commission should be examined, as well as \"the whole business of appealing PCC decisions\", something she said \"there would be a genuine welcome for the PCC's openness to look at\". \"Self-regulation has to constantly adapt and change. All these are areas where I think the PCC should take a fresh look under its fresh leadership,\" Ms Jowell said. Sir Christopher took up his role as PCC chairman yesterday. Ms Jowell emphasised the government had no intention of regulating the content of newspapers. \"The government does not have a role in relation to the content of our newspapers. We don't intend to assume such a role,\" she told the committee."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
