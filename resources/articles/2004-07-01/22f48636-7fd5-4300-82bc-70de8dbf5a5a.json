Martin was in second place when he misjudged a narrow, flat-out corner at the end of a half-mile straight, clipped a bank and overturned a number of times. The impact was so severe that it smashed a hole in his crash helmet. He was initially taken to hospital in Cosquin, then transferred to Cordoba for a brain scan. His British co-driver \"Beef\" Park was severely shaken but otherwise unharmed. It remains to be seen if Martin takes part in rallies at Punchestown next week or in a warm-up for the next world championship round, in Finland in a fortnight. The Finnish Peugeot driver Marcus Gronholm held a wafer-thin lead over the Citro\u00ebns of Carlos Sainz and S\u00e9bastien Loeb, the world championship leader, after six of the 26 stages. A loose wire had hampered Loeb in the opening stages. Petter Solberg led until he damaged his Subaru fording a river, which demoted him to fourth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
