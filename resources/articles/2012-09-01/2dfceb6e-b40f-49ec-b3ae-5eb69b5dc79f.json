While the likes of Dusky are doubling up tonight, London-based Detroit whiz-kid Seth Troxler trumps them by appearing at three of the best parties in the north, and he won't be letting up at any of them. He's consistently capable of manipulating main room spaces with ease, and it's a clear acknowledgment of these abilities that have led to him being invited to play at the second night of this season's Warehouse Project events (Manchester), the 10th birthday party of house night Circus (Liverpool) and in one of the six arenas of the debut Mint Festival (Leeds).In Manchester he appears alongside Nicolas Jaar, Maya Jane Coles, Heidi and Four Tet. In Liverpool he joins Sasha and Maceo Plex and the varied Leeds line up includes Jamie Jones, Surgeon, Adam Beyer, Speedy J, Eddie Halliwell and junglists Marky, Hype, Drumsound &amp; Bassline Smith. Various venues, Sat Marc Rowlands In:Motion: Just Jack, Bristol Signalling autumn's arrival as clearly as a conker-dangling child or towers of mince pies in a supermarket, the 2012 In:Motion season is arguably their most stellar yet. 2ManyDJs, Public Enemy, Huey Morgan, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and Fatboy Slim are but a few names pencilled in for a boat-pushing season of multi-roomed clubbing. Tonight it's the turn of Just Jack's mix of classy locals and big-name stars with headline slot going to London-based trippy tech house DJ/producer, Jamie Jones. The massive main room also sees Dan Ghenacia go back-to-back with fellow Circo Loco DJ Dyed Soundorom plus a live set of sunny-flavoured cosmic disco from Parisian producer, Seuil. Garage predominates in the second warehouse with Todd Edwards, Dusky and Midland, while The Tunnel will be hosted by Meadows In The Mountains plus a little help from Death On The Balcony and DeadEcho. Motion, Avon Street, Sat John Mitchell Found: Shoreditch Street Party, London Following Krankbrothers' successful roadblock on Shoreditch's Clifton Street back in June, Found are hoping to repeat the trick just around the corner. The DJ lineup is topped by two giants of the east coast house scene: Todd Edwards is the DJ/producer whose tough, jerky style and use of the now ubiquitous chopped-up vocals proved hugely influential in the development of UK garage. Ask Todd, and he'll say he owes it all to Marc \"MK\" Kinchen, who's recently reconnected with his underground roots after a period working in Hollywood. The UK, meanwhile, is represented here by Paul Woolford and Huxley, who between them are responsible for several of 2012's most kinetic dancefloor moments. The street party closes at 8pm, at which point the action moves indoors to Factory 7, where there's three good reasons to make a night of it: the presence of Boddika, Will Saul and Dusky \u2013 the latter, like Edwards, flitting between London and Bristol tonight. Earl Street/Factory 7, EC2, Sat Sam Richards New Life, Glasgow Two years on from the opening night, with almost 160 guest acts and four different venues behind them, it's safe to say that New Life have more than lived up to their name and tonight's second birthday sees one of the best lineups to date, with one of Scotland's top electro bananas in the driving seat. Chemikal Underground Records' rising star Miaoux Miaoux, aka Julian Corrie, brings his mix of hypercolour indie dance pop to the party with tracks from his recent debut album, Light Of The North, guaranteed an airing. Support comes from local DJ duo Pop Campaign. Bar Bloc, Bath Street, Sat Patric Baird Daphni Album Launch, London Three years ago, Caribou's Dan Snaith had an epiphany during a Theo Parrish DJ set at Plastic People. That epiphany not only inspired the dancier direction of the last Caribou album Swim, it also drove Snaith to create a new club-oriented alias called Daphni. He marks the release of Daphni's debut album Jiaolong with a marathon DJ stint, sure to encompass a whole sweep of genres, from proggy-synth workouts to psychedelic hip-hop and slamming techno. No 3D lightshow, no support act, no frills \u2013 just eight hours of mind-expanding tunes. The Bussey Building, SE15, Fri SR"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
