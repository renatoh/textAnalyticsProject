He still leads the world championship but made an uncharacteristic mistake here in the wet, where Max Verstappen won for Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel, starting from the back of the grid, surged through to take second for Ferrari. Hamilton went off after Mercedes had put him on slick tyres just as the rain returned. He thought the tyre choice had been wrong but held his hands up to the error, although it was then compounded by the team\u2019s strategy. \u201cI am only human, it was a mistake, mistakes happen,\u201d he said. \u201cToday was a combination of things. It is disappointing and upsetting for all of us, to be leading a grand prix and have it under control. Things are going to be thrown at you in conditions like this but it was like one domino after another, like snakes and ladders almost. I kept hitting the snakes. It just shows you how easy it is to get a weekend wrong.\u201d His teammate, Valtteri Bottas, crashed out on lap 58. It is the first time for more than a year, since the Austrian Grand Prix in 2018, that Mercedes have failed to finish with either car inside the top 10 on track. Toto Wolff described the result as \u201can Armageddon weekend for us\u201d. The Mercedes team chief could afford to be stoical given how strong they have proved until now. They have won nine of the 11 races this season. \u201cIt is not embarrassing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is motor racing and sometimes you\u2019ve got to take a slap on the chin and learn. These are the days which make us better.\u201d Wolff also confirmed Hamilton had been suffering from a bug. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t healthy the whole weekend,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he did the most he could to get himself in an OK place for the race. Many of us wouldn\u2019t have considered being in a race car. You can\u2019t be physically in your best game when you\u2019ve been ill for a few days.\u201d Hamilton did not use illness as an excuse, saying the test of racing in the wet had been mental rather than physical and insisting he would bounce back at the next grand prix in Hungary this weekend. \u201cWe pull together and regroup,\u201d the world champion said. \u201cThen we will come back fighting. We are still doing pretty awesome.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
