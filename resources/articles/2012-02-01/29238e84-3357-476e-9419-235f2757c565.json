The Well (which joins new material commissioned for last year's Cheltenham Jazz festival and Oslo's 2011 International Church Music festival) takes that group's development into more structurally intricate territory by Gustavsen's standards, but his signature ingredients of low-key gospel playing, acres of open space, memorable melodies and a glistening delicacy of touch are all present. A more urgent feel is quickly apparent when the opener's church-music solemnity is followed by a snare-drum tattoo and the pianist's rolls and swerves on the sinewy Playing. There are classical-sounding rhapsodies that turn into quiet groovers for Brunborg in his most early-Garbarek mode, the delicious Circling sounds like a slow, gospelly Keith Jarrett, and the shifting harmonies of the title track reflect Gustavsen's investigation of a slightly busier musical world. The evolving story of this group remains pretty irresistable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
