There has been no immediate explanation or claim of responsibility, but suspects seem certain to include a mysterious group called AZF, which has been trying to blackmail France by threatening its railway system. Bomb disposal experts neutralised the device, which was half-buried under a track in the village of Montieramey, on the rail route between Paris and Basel, the ministry said in a statement. There were conflicting reports about whether it resembled a sophisticated explosive device found on a viaduct north of Limoges, central France, on February 21. The earlier device's location was revealed by AZF, then a previously unknown group. The group claimed to have planted nine bombs along France's rail network, threatening to explode them as trains passed unless it was paid millions of euros. AZF is thought to consist of a former soldier and a woman, with no Islamist or political connections. The group's threats were first disclosed in early March. They appeared in at least three letters sent to the offices of the French president, Jacques Chirac, and the interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, on December 10, February 13 and 17. The letters demanded sums varying between \u00a32.1m and \u00a3650,000, and threatened railway targets."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
