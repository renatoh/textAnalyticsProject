Until a delightful curled strike by Yaya Tour\u00e9 in the last minute gave City a two\u2011goal cushion, Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s team had sloppily allowed Kyiv back into the tie during a second half in which they scored and gave City other scares. Chief among these was a Vitaliy Buyalskiy effort that forced Joe Hart into a superb save to his right before Tour\u00e9 struck. The quest to reach the quarter-finals for the first time began with Tour\u00e9 strong-arming Denys Garmash to give away a free-kick. This was floated in by Andriy Yarmalenko and when the No10 followed it into the area the ball came back to him and he forced Hart to tip a cross-shot on to the bar. Pellegrini had Fernandinho and Raheem Sterling flanking Tour\u00e9 and Fernando in midfield and David Silva behind Sergio Ag\u00fcero. Tour\u00e9 pinged a ball into Ag\u00fcero, who returned it for the Ivorian to hit it at Oleksandr Shovkovskiy. Kyiv threatened when Lukasz Teodorczyk, profiting from Fernando\u2019s clumsy play, broke clear but his effort did not trouble Hart. City\u2019s opener derived from fine work along the left from Sterling, who won the visitors\u2019 opening corner. Kyiv had been unable to make the two they had taken count, and Silva was to show them how. He curved the ball on to Tour\u00e9\u2019s head. He headed down and Ag\u00fcero was unmarked and in no mood to miss from close range for a 16th goal from his past 17 starts in the competition. Moments later, the Argentinian should have doubled the lead. Garmash dawdled, Fernando stole the ball, and when it was recycled to Ag\u00fcero the striker\u2019s run was clever as it peeled off to the right but the finish was less so, blazing across Shovkovskiy and wide. A truism of this City side is that they find it hard to shut the back door. Just as Fernando\u2019s earlier error allowed Teodorczyk in so, too, a Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi mistake ceded possession to the danger man Yarmolenko and his clever pass in behind released Teodorczyk, but his effort lacked composure. An open contest was developing in which each time Kyiv or City were on the ball they pushed forward instantly. A fine tackle by Fernando won possession and he sprayed it left to Ag\u00fcero whose run was mirrored by Tour\u00e9. The ball came to the midfielder precisely where he would want and the shot forced Shovkovskiy to turn it away for a corner. The 41-year-old could do nothing to prevent City\u2019s classy second as the break neared. Ag\u00fcero twisted and turned and backheeled to Sterling. The forward ghosted into space and his pass removed the Kyiv rearguard. Silva could not and did not miss. It was Kyiv\u2019s return following the winter break, though Serhiy Rebrov\u2019s team had played 13 friendlies over the past month to mitigate against rustiness. There is no substitute for competitive matches and when the referee, Antonio Mateu Lahoz, blew for half-time Kyiv found themselves up against it. Perhaps referencing the decision to start six teenagers in the 5-1 FA Cup defeat at Chelsea, Pellegrini said before kick-off: \u201cWe have a very good starting 11 and we need a performance against a difficult team. It is always important to score an away goal. Our target is to try to score from the beginning. It is a very important moment.\u201d He would have been pleased with the first half. City were coasting and the manager\u2019s interval chat may have stressed the importance of simply continuing as they had: squeeze Kyiv, take the ball, then move towards goal at pace. Rebrov replaced Teodorczyk with J\u00fanior Moraes for the second half and the hope may have been that the No11 could be as ruthless as City had proved in front of goal. Moraes was handed the ball by a clumsy pass from Ga\u00ebl Clichy and the ensuing Kyiv attack ended with Yarmolenko firing a shot at Hart that was a warning to City to refocus. To quieten the Olimpiyskiy stadium the best ploy was to grab the ball and come at Kyiv. Sterling caught on and might have won a penalty when going down near Aleksandar Dragovic but Mateu Lahoz was unimpressed. A second shout for a spot-kick came a few minutes later when Dragovic came together with Silva and the Spaniard appealed but again the referee said no. In between Kyiv scored and City could curse their luck. Otamendi headed clear only to see Buyalskiy\u2019s effort pinball off him and past Hart for 2-1. This had become uncomfortable for City. Miguel Veloso found Yarmolenko who should have set up Moraes, then Sterling had to make a saving tackle to thwart Veloso. Tour\u00e9\u2019s late goal increased the margin in what ended as a fine victory and City should finish business at the Etihad Stadium on 15 March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
