In Germany, what counted was Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's insistence that none of the three would be able to afford their current social security systems for very much longer without some fairly fundamental changes - the issue that has landed him in such big domestic trouble in recent months. And in France, all that really mattered was that after a great many months of personal lobbying, Mr Chirac had finally managed to persuade Mr Schr\u00f6der to back the French president's fervent desire to slash the VAT on restaurant bills in France from 19.6% to 5.5% from 2006. Mr Chirac knew it sounded strange. \"I know you're smiling, but you shouldn't be,\" he told reporters at the joint post-summit press conference. \"In France, this is something that people have pinned very high hopes on.\" He then thanked the German chancellor \"most warmly\" for having understood what was \"a very specific problem for France\". In fact, of course, the level of VAT levied on restaurant bills was first and foremost a very specific problem for Mr Chirac. True, France's 200,000 restaurateurs have lobbied for years for the reduction, saying it would allow them to improve their lot by cutting their prices to customers, taking on new staff, investing in better equipment and widening their pitifully thin profit margins. It was manifestly unfair, they argued, that takeaway and fast-food joints should benefit from the lower VAT rate - an anomaly that was driving a nation of dedicated foodies out of proper eateries and into burger bars and (yuk) sandwicheries. Up to 3,000 decent restaurateurs a year were going bankrupt, they said, whereas 40,000 new jobs could be created if the VAT bill was cut. True also, Mr Chirac, who not only appreciates a good meal but also understands the value of 200,000 votes, has always been sympathetic to their point of view. So much so that in his 2002 election campaign he promised to make sure France's restaurateurs got what they wanted. But unfortunately for the president, in the European Union, decisions on changes to a member state's VAT rates have to be taken unanimously by the union's finance ministers. And Germany, despite being the other half of the celebrated Franco-German motor, was not playing ball for fear that its restaurateurs (what? there are restaurants in Germany? protest the French) would demand the same. Mr Schr\u00f6der, as recently as a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate meeting between the two heads of state on February 9, was adamant: it was no. France's outraged chefs began cranking up the pressure. Andr\u00e9 Dugoin, their Michelin-starred leader, was quite plain about the consequences of Mr Chirac's miserable failure to keep his word. \"When a promise is made, a promise must be kept,\" he said ominously last week. \"We will not forget this.\" Less than a month before key regional elections in which Mr Chirac's ruling UMP party looks like it's going to need all the votes it can get, Mr Dugoin added: \"Under these circumstances, it's going to be very hard for me to stop some of the boys casting their ballot for the far right.\" Many dozens of distinctly unhappy restaurateurs had already declared themselves candidates for rival parties like the UDF and the traditionalist CNPT, Mr Dugoin noted. More were considering doing so. And just how many millions of their customers might they take with them? That was all Mr Chirac needed to hear. Spurred on by his prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, who was convinced this issue alone would lead directly to the UMP's defeat in at least two of France's regions, Brittany and his own Poitou-Charentes, the president came up with a Plan B: in compensation, the restaurateurs' social and other charges would be slashed by euros1.5bn over 18 months. The finance ministry wasn't too happy (it wasn't even consulted), and nor were several other ministers whose budgets were going to have to be shaved for the greater good of the party (and, eventually, the nation's well-being). The restaurateurs, too, were only half-satisfied. And then, manna from heaven, came Mr Schr\u00f6der's wholly unexpected approval for the VAT cut. With Germany's backing, France is now firmly convinced that by 2006 it can win over the rest of the doubters (notably the Dutch) and secure unanimous agreement for its proposal, pitched very much as a precious means of creating new jobs. In the interim, of course, the government will still have to fork out the euros 1.5bn it has pledged. And no one is even speculating what France offered, or will have to offer, Germany in exchange. But all in all, it'll no doubt be a small price to pay for saving Mr Chirac's electoral bacon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
