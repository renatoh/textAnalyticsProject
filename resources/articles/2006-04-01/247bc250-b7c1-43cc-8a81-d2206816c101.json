This possibility is stated every so often, but I have never seen it mentioned in the context of the debate over pensions, where it is assumed that life expectancy will continue rising.

Ralph Jones Rochester, Kent Your report (Crowds force closure of theme park, April 17) tells us the drop in the new Thorpe Park rollercoaster is (a) vertical and (b) the fourth steepest in the world. Clearly the other three rides must penetrate into the fifth dimension. Dr Fergus Lalor Cork, Ireland \"By 2002,\" writes Eric Schlosser (Stuff the kids, G2, April 24), \"the top five food advertisers in the UK were McDonald's, Coca-Cola, KFC and Pizza Hut.\" Eric's been eating too many burgers.
