It's a challenge to take children away for just a few days, and especially somewhere without a pool, kids' club and other diversions. I also feel under pressure to see all the major sites and culture spots in a very short time - not so easy with three-year-old twins in tow. So it's encouraging to see so many of you go abroad for a weekend. Nearly everyone writing in to the Travelling With Kids Forum recommends staying in apartments - often short on character, but high on convenience - including Citadines (citadines.com) and City Apartments in Rome (cityapartments.it). And you have some ideas about what kit to take. Most advise carrying your own car seat, even if it's only for the taxi from the airport. But ditch the buggy. \"In Rome, use a backpack, as the pavements are narrow and bumpy,\" writes Angela Blair. In Paris, says another reader, use a sling as the metro is ridden with stairs. There are so many ways to transport your child these days. I'm testing some of them on the twins, who are getting used to being guinea pigs. I'll tell you what they said next week. \u00b7 Please share tips on the Travelling with Kids Forum at deabirkett.com."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
