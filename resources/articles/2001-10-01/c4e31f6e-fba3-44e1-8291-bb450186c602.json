With 6m people threatened with starvation and winter no more than six weeks away, aid agencies face a race against time to get sufficient stockpiles of food into the country. It is a race they look almost certain to lose as long as the bombing continues. The World Food Programme (WFP) estimates that 50,000 tonnes of food a month are needed to feed the millions on the brink of starvation, as well as the 1.5m refugees the UN anticipates will emerge as a result of the allied attacks. With the central highlands and much of the north of the country inaccessible for up to five months in winter, stock piles of 250,000 tonnes of food have to be transported in the next four to six weeks. Even before the current cris is reduced the flow of aid to a trickle, the largest amount of food the WFP managed to deliver in a month was 30,000 tonnes. With bombing raids continuing day and night, it is hard to envisage how the targets can be met. Even the WFP's most optimistic forecast, that 1,800 tonnes could be moved every day until winter sets in, will leave millions facing starvation. The WFP is attempting to accelerate its food convoys in response to the crisis. Since Wednesday three convoys loaded with more than 3,000 tonnes of food and wheat flour left Iran, Tajikistan and Pakistan. \"It is one of the most difficult tasks WFP has faced in its history,\" Francesco Luna, a WFP spokesman in Islamabad said last night. \"In some areas Taliban officials have begun to demand new taxes from WFP drivers. Yesterday in Spin Baldak, near the border crossing at Chaman in western Pakistan, Taliban soldiers stopped a convoy of trucks carrying 400 tonnes of food and ordered drivers to pay $32 (\u00a322) in tax per tonne. We refused but we hope to be able to get the convoy through,\" said Mr Luna. Three consecutive years of drought left Afghanistan on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe even before the September 11 attacks on America. Since then most foreign aid workers have left the country and local food distribution networks have been disrupted as people flee the bombing. \"We're extremely worried,\" said David Throp, an emergency adviser for Save the Children. \"We have an extremely limited window to get food in, and every day that passes without food moving is a day lost.\" \"We've got to find trucks and drivers, and we've got to do it before winter,\" said an Oxfam spokesman. \"We have to believe that we can get to as many of these people as we can.\" According to the WFP, the immediate problem is not access to food, but transport. Around 300,000 tonnes of food are awaiting shipment on the Afghan border in Iran and Pakistan, but there are not enough trucks to move it all. \"It's really a question of having enough trucks and having the proper distribution networks,\" said Trevor Rowe, a WFP spokesman in Rome. \"One of the problems is securing enough commercial truck drivers who are willing to go in. The problem is exacerbated in the rural areas. Even before the bombing we had stories of people in the north eating locusts, animal fodder and grass.\" While the WFP welcomes any food aid to Afghanistan, including the US airdrops of daily rations, Oxfam and Christian Aid are opposed to what they consider to be random and inadequate distribution. It is also expensive; to deliver 50,000 tonnes by air requires more than 1,650 Hercules flights. The WFP has said it may have to resort to food drops to the central highlands if the need becomes acute, but they will be very different from the American model, with organisers on the ground in the drop zone preventing food riots and ensuring that food is properly distributed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
