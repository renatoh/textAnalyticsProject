The first picture of consumer behaviour during the entire month of September was revealed in a survey of sales data from 74 American retailers, which showed its smallest rise for the month of September for more than 20 years. Consumer spending - which has buoyed the American economy for the last decade - has been closely watched by economists who fear that the consumers' decision to cut back on non-essential purchases will accelerate the economic slowdown . The 0.8% rise in sales shown by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi survey represents a fall if the increase in sales at discount food retailers such as Wal-Mart are stripped out. \"Wal-Mart benefits because consumers switch there, because its prices are lower,\" said Kevin Mundt, director of Mercer Management consultancy firm. \"Given the economic concerns, people aren't going to spend on luxury items,\" he said. Wal-Mart said sales had risen 6.3% on the same month last year. But Federated Department Stores, which owns Macy's in New York, said sales had fallen 13%, while clothing chain Gap said sales fell 17%. \"About half our total sales shortfall came in week two of the month, following the tragic events of September 11,\" said Heidi Kunz, Gap's chief financial officer. But there were signs that confidence had improved towards the end of the month and might be returning to more normal levels. Mike Niemira, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi economist, said retailers saw sales pick up later in the month and that such a trend was normal. \"Nonetheless, damage was already done,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
