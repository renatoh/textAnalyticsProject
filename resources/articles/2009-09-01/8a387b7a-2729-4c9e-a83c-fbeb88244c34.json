The author of science fiction classics The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds and The Invisible Man, Wells lived in Sandgate, just outside Folkestone, for 13 years. The area was a literary hub at the time, with Joseph Conrad nearby in Postling, Henry James in Rye and The Railway Children author Edith Nesbitt in Dymchurch. Wells left Sandgate for London in 1909 after the publication of his feminist novel Ann Veronica was greeted with scandal, and one hundred years after his departure, local residents have decided to hold a festival \"in honour of his genius\". Visitors at the inaugural HG Wells festival enjoyed talks about the author, an exhibition of pictures and art work inspired by Wells's The Sea Lady and a guided walk around Folkestone in the footsteps of one of his greatest creations, the draper Arthur Kipps. The festival also saw the launch of the first HG Wells literary prize for a short handwritten story in the style of Wells, won by 13-year-old William Jarrett. The prize is the bequest of Sandgate resident Reginald Turnill, the BBC aerospace correspondent who gave an eyewitness broadcast from Nasa of the moon landing. Turnill, author of H G Wells, Love &amp; Literature in Sandgate, 1896-1909, interviewed Wells in the 1930s, and remembers his \"squeaky voice\". According to Simon J James, editor of The Wellsian and senior lecturer in Victorian literature at Durham university, Wells's reputation is gradually recovering from the scorn heaped upon him by modernist critics such as Virginia Woolf. \"He is seen as an important writer, more so now than a few decades ago,\" he said. For James, Wells's greatest achievement was not his science fiction but his straightforward realist fiction, such as Tono-Bungay, which he said was \"one of the great Edwardian novels\", and which he teaches alongside EM Forster's Howards End at Durham. \"I started looking at HG Wells because of my interest in early 20th century realism in fiction \u2013 and if you're interested in realism, you've got to be interested in Wells.\" Google, however, has been focusing strictly on the science fiction element of Wells's writing, teasing internet conspiracy theorists with a series of unexplained Google doodles leading up to today's celebration of his birthday. In a post on the Google blog, Micheal Lopez acknowledged the reason for the doodles, with \"an official nod to Herbert George, who would be 143 years old today,\" Last Tuesday, the search engine tweeted the coordinates \"51.327629, -0.5616088\", which led followers to Horsell Common in Woking, Surrey, made famous in 1898 by Wells in The War of the Worlds as the scene for the first Martian landing. \"A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps of a bear, was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder. As it bulged up and caught the light, it glistened like wet leather,\" Wells wrote. \"A lank tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air. Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
