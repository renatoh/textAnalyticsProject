Thousands of young people were expected to gather at the UN climate conference and in the streets of the Spanish capital on Friday to protest against the lack of progress in tackling the climate emergency, as officials from more than 190 countries wrangled over the niceties of wording in documents related to the Paris accord. In the four years since the landmark agreement was signed, greenhouse gas emissions have risen by 4% and the talks this year are not expected to produce new commitments on carbon from the world\u2019s biggest emitters. Thunberg, whose solo protest in Sweden in 2018 has since snowballed into a global movement, spoke at a press conference before a march through the centre of Madrid. She said that although schoolchildren had been striking around the world, this \u201chas not translated into action\u201d from governments. \u201cI\u2019m just an activist and we need more activists,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people are afraid to change \u2013 they try so desperately to silence us.\u201d Thunberg expressed hope for the UN negotiations but doubted whether governments had got the message, and warned the world could not afford continued inaction. \u201cI sincerely hope COP25 will reach something concrete and increase awareness among people, and that world leaders and people in power grasp the urgency of the climate crisis, because right now it does not seem that they are,\u201d she said. Although young people would keep striking, Thunberg said, they wanted to stop \u2013 if governments made credible promises and showed a willingness to act. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this; it is not sustainable that children skip school and we don\u2019t want to continue \u2013 we would love some action from the people in power. People are suffering and dying today. We can\u2019t wait any longer,\u201d she said. The march was scheduled to coincide with protests and youth climate strikes around the world. In the US, Bernie Sanders and Jane Fonda were among the politicians and celebrities planning to join in. As well as the march and a sit-down protest in the conference centre, there were shows of international solidarity among young people from around the world, including a picnic in a central Madrid park. The conference centre was flooded with hundreds of schoolchildren accompanied by their parents, many with babies in prams, who were kept separate from the rooms where negotiators were working on a draft text to clarify aspects of the Paris agreement. Young people voiced their frustration at protests inside and outside the conference centre on the outskirts of Madrid. Brianna Fruean from Samoa, speaking for the Pacific Climate Warriors, told the conference: \u201cWorld leaders need to know that people like me are watching them. The text we put down today on paper at COP is what our future will look like.\u201d Many of the young people joining the conference from developing nations around the world bore personal witness to suffering they had experienced or seen. \u201cI\u2019ve had typhoid. I\u2019ve had malaria. My grandmother died from cholera. I know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d said Jimmy F\u00e9nelon, the national coordinator of the Caribbean Youth Environmental Network in Haiti. \u201cWe need to raise awareness among young people. We can get them to work together and send a strong message.\u201d Renae Baptiste, also from CYEN, said: \u201cFor us, climate change is no longer a concept or theory, it\u2019s our new reality. It\u2019s affecting our lives now.\u201d The activist Miguel van der Velden said: \u201cThese things are not games. They\u2019re getting worse. They\u2019re affecting millions of people around the world. I come here because I have hope that we can work together.\u201d \u2022 This article was updated on 9 December 2019 to correct the year Greta Thunberg\u2019s school strike started \u2013 it was 2018, not 2017."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
