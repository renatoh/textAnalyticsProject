As ridiculous as that would have sounded back in July, when Ranieri was unveiled as Nigel Pearson\u2019s replacement and Susan Whelan, the club\u2019s chief executive, asked the fans to trust their judgement because the Italian\u2019s appointment was greeted with such a mixed response, the reality is that Leicester have put themselves in a fantastic position to play Champions League football next season. This convincing victory over a desperately disappointing Stoke side, courtesy of goals from Danny Drinkwater, Jamie Vardy and Leonardo Ulloa, lifted Leicester back to the Premier League summit, yet arguably much more important for Ranieri and his players was the fact that they have now opened up a 10-point lead over fifth-placed Manchester United. In other words, a top-four finish is starting to feel like Leicester\u2019s to lose. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ranieri said when the \u201cfailure\u201d question was put to him. \u201cFor me it\u2019s important to let our fans dream. We will lose, but it\u2019s important, like against Tottenham in the FA Cup, that we fight to the end. I was so pleased that we were losing 2-0 but Kasper Schmeichel still tried to score a goal \u2013 fantastic! I wasn\u2019t a big champion when I was a player but my character was very, very strong, and I see the team is like my character.\u201d The other question \u2013 and as each week goes by it becomes harder to dismiss it out of hand \u2013 is whether Leicester can do the unthinkable and go on to win the title. By the middle of next month that should be a little easier to answer because Leicester play Liverpool at home next and then travel to Arsenal and Manchester City, their closest rivals at the top. If Leicester were to come through those three fixtures in decent shape \u2013 and it is a big if \u2013 Gary Lineker may start to regret that promise he made to present the first Match of the Day show of next season in his underpants should his former club be crowned champions. For many people the expectation is that Leicester will fall away and something resembling the old order at the top of the table will be restored, yet that view has been pedalled for months now and Ranieri\u2019s players are quietly enjoying the fact that they continue to upset the odds. \u201cWe are top of the league and it is a huge achievement for this club,\u201d said Drinkwater, who set up Vardy\u2019s goal as well as scoring his first in the Premier League. \u201cThe points are proof we deserve to be there. If anyone doubts us still it is up to them \u2013 as long as we keep proving them wrong. There has not been much negative stuff around us this season, but the boys will talk about it if a team or whoever has been talking badly of us. Then we will be the first ones looking to put it right.\u201d Any suggestions that Vardy and Riyad Mahrez had lost their way were certainly put to bed on a day when the England international scored his first goal in eight matches and the Algerian was back to being the player that bamboozles defenders, no more so that when he delightfully nutmegged Philipp Wollscheid before Ulloa scored Leicester\u2019s third. Stoke were unable to cope with the intensity of Leicester\u2019s play, in particular in the second half, when the home team attacked and pressed so aggressively. \u201cI knew exactly how they were going to play but stopping it happening is more difficult,\u201d said the Stoke manager Mark Hughes. \u201cThis is a difficult place to come, they have players in good form who are enjoying their football and they have that threat and that ability to take chances when they create, which is the difference.\u201d The challenge for Stoke now is to get this result out of their system before Tuesday night\u2019s Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Liverpool, where Hughes hopes that his captain Ryan Shawcross will be fit to play despite his captain limping off against Leicester with a back problem. \u201cWe can\u2019t dwell too much on this match,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick the bones out of it like we always do but we must make sure we can step up now and go again. It\u2019s a great game for us, it is a cup semi-final for goodness sake, and if we can\u2019t get up for that there\u2019s something wrong somewhere, so I anticipate it will be a completely different performance on Tuesday.\u201d Man of the match Danny Drinkwater (Leicester)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
