Somehow between them Arsenal and Liverpool produced a 0-0 draw with almost no defending in it \u2013 not to mention in Arsenal\u2019s case a contender for what must be the least reassuring, most hysterically misleading clean sheet in recent memory. This was a good point for Liverpool, for whom Christian Benteke had a fine all-round game and the 18-year-old Joe Gomez, the Catford Cafu, was excellent at left-back. It was a good point for Arsenal, too, in the end given they could have been three down at half-time. The overriding impression, though, is of a team that remains depressingly, needlessly open in midfield and defence. At times during the late Wengerball years there has almost been something noble about Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s commitment to what are usually described as his \u201cfootball principles\u201d. Arsenal are fluid. Arsenal are fluent. Arsenal don\u2019t clog. Arsenal don\u2019t tackle. Arsenal don\u2019t, even when it\u2019s painfully necessary, reinforce what has become an alarmingly flaccid central spine. There is at least a sense of development here. More often in the past it has been Wenger\u2019s over-engineered attack that has infuriated. Here comes Ars\u00e8ne again, wheeling his harpsichord out on to the touchline, strings furred with grass, sheet music sodden, legs clogged with mud, when most of the time all he really needs is a pair of bongos. Here, though, the most bizarre aspect of Arsenal\u2019s play was the insistence on trying and failing to play out from the back, giving the ball away so many times it almost looked like a tactic. Calum Chambers may end up having worse games but the limits of human possibility suggest not many and not by much. A genuinely odd opening 45 minutes at the Emirates saw Liverpool transformed into Arsenal \u2013 all fine, searching attacking play but no finish \u2013 and Arsenal transformed into a hilariously brittle impersonation of a football team without any interest in protecting its own goalkeeper. At the end of which it was tempting to conclude there is indeed a degree of genuine perversity, of stubborn amour propre in Wenger\u2019s refusal to strengthen, physically and defensively, this team of fine attacking talents. Instead, three matches into a season that was supposed to provide a ratcheting back up towards genuine title contenders, Arsenal have shown in every game the same unaddressed weakness: a lack of presence and bite through the centre of the team that makes such talk seem absurdly hopeful. Better teams than Liverpool will punish them. Worse teams than Liverpool will punish them. Above all we have simply been here too many times before. The talk in recent days has been of midfield replacements, with Lars Bender the latest name dredged up by the defensive midfield random name generator. Why, one wonders, are we still talking about this, so obvious is the need, the sense of an excellent attacking team let down by the absence of a little routine stitching at its back. Here Arsenal were almost overrun in the first half. Liverpool should have had a penalty when Francis Coquelin dived in on Philippe Coutinho, who hit the woodwork twice. With 40 minutes gone Benteke got as close to scoring as it is possible to come without at least registering half a goal. Roberto Firmino crossed from the left. Benteke made contact with his right foot so close to goal there seemed no need to lift or blast or even really direct the ball. Petr Cech, who is clearly getting used to this kind of thing, not only anticipated where his shot was going but got down to claw it away. It was a stunning save. There were some extenuating circumstances for Arsenal on the night. With Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny out Wenger was forced to field a central defensive-midfield pivot made up of three players with scarcely a full season between them, and Coquelin required to police not just his own central block in front of the defence but the pockets of space left by not one but two gadabout full-backs . The home team did improve in the second half as memories of that lost 45 minutes began to fade. Santi Cazorla dropped deeper. The defence held the ball better. We know they can do this. What will remain though is the sheer sense of waste at seeing all that attacking power undone by such a lack of rigour at its back. Whatever Arsenal\u2019s future holds from here it will not involve Karim Benzema, who has committed himself to Real Madrid, though the prospect of Wenger getting round to breaking the club\u2019s transfer record for an upgrade on his current muscular late-20s France international centre-forward was always perhaps remote \u2013 and rightly so. This is already a fine attacking team, stuffed, indeed over-stuffed, with players of grace and craft. It is instead that enduring lack of sinew, the slackness through the spine, that Wenger needs to address first, or face up to another season of delightful, soft-touch frustration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
