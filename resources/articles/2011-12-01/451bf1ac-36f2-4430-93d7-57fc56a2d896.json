Southampton went into this game hoping to set a post-war record for consecutive home victories by racking up their 22nd in a row at St Mary's but they were outplayed by Blackpool and required a stoppage\u2011time goal from their top scorer, Rickie Lambert, to salvage a point. Their away displays have been unconvincing \u2013 they have lost their past two \u2013 and if their home ones start going the same way they will relinquish the position at the top of the Championship that they have held since the start of the season. So long as they have Lambert, however, Southampton will be dangerous. Blackpool had started the better and their clever, crisp passing was making the league leaders look lubberly, but against the run of play Lambert fired the hosts in front on the half-hour, albeit with the help of a deflection off Craig Cathcart. Blackpool came back, first through Chris Basham and then thanks to a shot from Callum McManaman that the goalkeeper, Bartosz Bialkowski, allowed to trickle into the net. A calf injury to Southampton's regular goalkeeper, Kelvin Davis, meant Bialkowski was making his first league start in two years and his rustiness was evident throughout, as he never looked secure. The manager, Nigel Adkins, says there is a good chance Davis will be fit for next weekend. Southampton supporters will hope he is, as the derby against Portsmouth at Fratton Park could be an ordeal for a goalkeeper lacking confidence. Bialkowski's blunder was not the main reason Southampton failed to win. Blackpool played better all round. \"It's disappointing that our winning streak has come to an end, but I don't think we deserved the win so it was good to get a draw in the last minute,\" said Lambert. \"Full credit to Blackpool as I thought they were terrific.\" Ian Holloway agreed and expressed his delight with his team, who are on the brink of the play-offs and a possible return to the Premier League despite the loss in the summer of players such as Charlie Adam and David Vaughan. He was less happy, however, with the referee, claiming that Geoff Eltringham's decision to add five minutes of time \u2013 during which Lambert equalised \u2013 was influenced by the home crowd. He said similar decisions are the reason that Blackpool were relegated last season. \"Little teams like us get squashed,\" he said. \"We got squashed last year. I read an article that said we should have had at least nine more points [last season] if officials had got decisions correct. If that doesn't prove that small clubs don't get a look\u2011in, then have a look at this game [against Southampton] \u2013 the crowd influenced the referee. I expect them to be stronger.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
