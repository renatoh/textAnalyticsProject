Patrick Morrisey issued a statement saying that his office would no longer fight a court challenge to the state\u2019s ban. He said his office \u201cwill respect\u201d Monday\u2019s supreme court decision not to take up a Virginia case. US district judge Robert Chambers in Huntington had previously put West Virginia\u2019s case on hold. Attorneys for three same-sex couples asked Chambers to grant a motion for summary judgment based on the outcome of the case in Virginia, which shares a federal appeal court jurisdiction with West Virginia. In South Carolina, the state supreme court has ordered probate courts not to issue same-sex marriage licenses until a federal judge decides whether the state\u2019s constitutional ban on the unions is legal in the light of the Virginia decision. The justices issued a ruling late Thursday morning, a day after probate court Judge Irving Condon began accepting applications for the licenses. Meanwhile, a case from a couple who were married in Washington DC and want to be recognized in South Carolina and have the ban overturned is before a federal judge. Earlier on Thursday, the US supreme court admitted that justice Anthony Kennedy mistakenly blocked the start of same-sex marriage in Nevada. Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Kennedy\u2019s order issued a day earlier was an error, corrected by Kennedy several hours later with a second order. By that time, however, Nevada officials had decided to hold off on issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples Wednesday until they could be certain the legal situation was settled. The ninth US circuit court of appeals in San Francisco declared bans on same-sex marriage in Idaho and Nevada illegal on Tuesday. They joined a rapidly growing number of states where gay marriage bans have been struck down. But Idaho quickly asked the supreme court for a delay, while Nevada planned to allow same-sex weddings to proceed. The trouble arose because Idaho\u2019s request to the court included a document from the appeals court that listed case numbers for both states. After lawyers and reporters sought clarification of the order, Kennedy put out a new order that began, \u201cUpon further consideration ...\u201d He lifted his hold as it applied to Nevada, but left it in place for Idaho."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
