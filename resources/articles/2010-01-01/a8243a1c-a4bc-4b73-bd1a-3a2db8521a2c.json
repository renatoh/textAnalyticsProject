In a blow to Alistair Darling's ambition of curbing the bonus culture, City sources said major banks are likely to absorb the cost of the one-off tax in order to maintain the depth of their considerable bonus pools. The Treasury said it was up to shareholders in major banks to stop bonus payments in the wake of the taxpayer bailout of the banking system. Bankers have admitted that dividend payouts to investors could be hit if financial institutions use profits to absorb the cost of the one-off 50% tax rather than letting bonus pools take the burden instead. \"If these payments go ahead, it is a sign that shareholders have more work to do to put more sensible pay policies in place,\" a Treasury spokesman said. However, the Treasury added that a bigger-than-expected windfall for bankers would at least contain a silver lining for taxpayers. Proceeds from the tax could be more than \u00a32bn, four times greater than the \u00a3550m estimated by the chancellor in the pre-budget report. John McFall, chairman of the Treasury select committee, which has excoriated banks for their perceived excesses in the run-up to the credit crunch, said the sector had not learned its lessons. A leading shareholders' organisation said a UK-only tax cannot stop global banks, including those with significant British operations, from paying out multibillion pound bonuses. Peter Montagnon of the Association of British Insurers said stopping bonuses was not the sole responsibility of shareholders. \"It is a no-brainer if all the financial centres had applied the tax but the fact is that nobody else has. This has created a real serious management problem for international businesses.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
