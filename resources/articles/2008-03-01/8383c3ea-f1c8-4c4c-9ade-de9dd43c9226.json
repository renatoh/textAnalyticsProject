First up is comrade Jay Rayner, author of our profile of Nick Denton, who dishes the dirt on his old friend and discusses the influence of blogging. Next up we have the Kent Ertegrul, the CEO of Phorm - that's the controversial advertising platform that has many of you up in arms. He's answering questions on how his company works and what the implications could be. As if that wasn't enough roving reporter Jemima Kiss is on the blower from Austin, Texas, where she's been cavorting with the world wide webkids at the South By South West festival. Among the topics is the now-infamous interview with Mark Zuckerberg; Jemima tells us \"the whole thing was like a really awkward date... which happened to have several thousand people watching it\". Plus presenter Aleks Krotoski brings us the news and views with regular pod panellists Charles Arthur and Bobbie Johnson. Tell us your thoughts in the comments: on the guests, the issues or the show itself. \u00b7 The podcast feed URL \u00b7 Subscribe free to Tech Weekly via iTunes \u00b7 Visit our Facebook group \u00b7 The Tech Weekly archives"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
