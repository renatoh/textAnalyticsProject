Familiar voices come from the wrong side of the chamber, as if your stereo had gone wrong. Newbies are desperate to demonstrate that they are part of the \"new politics\" yet at the same time nervously try to follow the traditions, often getting them wrong, blurting out a name instead of a constituency. Every Labour speech is seen as part of the leadership contest, as if the starving French army, retreating from Moscow, devoted its time to arguing about who should replace Napoleon. George Osborne looks impossibly young to be chancellor. He reminds me of a joke Alan Coren told. A young Jewish lad from Brooklyn makes a pile and buys a yacht plus the full outfit, including a peaked cap with braided anchor. He proudly visits his parents. His mother sighs. \"To me, you're a captain. To your father, you're a captain. But to a captain, are you a captain?\" It's all very confusing. Russell Grant, the man who reads the stars, has engaged a PR company to send his prognostications to the press and tout for business. Apparently these past few weeks have been dangerous for political talks, owing to Mercury being retrograde. \"When Saturn moves back into Libra on July 21, is when [sic] we will start to see Cameron emerge as prime minister \u2026\" Memo from an old political hack to Russell: only make your predictions after the event. Otherwise you risk looking like a complete prannet. And last Monday, there landed on my desk a coalition mug, on which Nick Clegg and David Cameron gaze adoringly into each other's eyes. It's marked Made in China. This means that in less than two weeks, contracts have been signed, artwork emailed 6,000 miles, the mugs produced, shipped to Britain, and parcelled off to journalists. This is an awesome example of globalisation. \u2712 Now and again, you realise that there are parts of this country which remain glorious, as fine as anywhere else in the world. Last weekend we went to Fowey, Cornwall, for the Daphne du Maurier literary festival, where I was doing a turn. The event is held high above the town with almost miraculous views over green lawns, scarlet rhododendrons, the ancient waterfront, and the sun glittering on the estuary. The festival may be threatened by local authority cuts. I would be fearful. Local authorities do not always live in the same world as us. \"As your treasurer I must tell you that times are hard. We have a choice between backing the Du Maurier festival, which brings thousands of people into Cornwall, and sends them home carolling the matchless beauty of our county. Or we could have a few more speed bumps.\" You just know which one they'll choose. In the car we listened to the CD of the author's last big success, The House on the Strand, set a few miles away in the Treesmill valley, where we visited the lovely Hidden Valley gardens. Then, a huge treat, to the Camel Valley vineyard, where Bob Lindo, a former RAF pilot (and Guardian reader \u2013 unusual in the wine trade), makes one of the two finest English sparklers. We sat with Bob on his terrace, gazing down the rows of vines that dip down the majestic, sun-sodden valley, sipping half a dozen of his finest wines, so much in demand that he only has a limited supply for his daughter's wedding this summer. His bubbles win awards around the world, but 21 years ago he started out with a Curry's fridge and inserted the crucial sugar dosage in each bottle with a sheep dipper. Everyone can go, any summer day except Sundays. In the evening we drove into the setting sun to a friend's rambling house in west Cornwall, where she served each guest a whole lobster that had been crawling in the sea that morning. Once a year, perhaps, nature and mankind present you with a perfect day. That was ours for 2010. \u2712 My old friend Valerie Grove has a new book, So Much To Tell, about Kaye Webb, the woman best known for running the Puffin Club and publishing some of the most loved children's books since the war. Valerie has become a friend of Ronald Searle, who was married to Kaye before moving out, without warning or explanation, after 10 years and two children. He now lives in France, where he has just celebrated his 90th birthday. Even the modern masters \u2013 Steve Bell, Gerald Scarfe, Posy Simmonds \u2013 acknowledge Searle as the greatest cartoonist of the age, so it's particularly sad that he has left his archive to a German museum. This is partly because he's fed up with being remembered here only for St Trinian's and Molesworth and not for his more serious reportage. It's a little like AA Milne imagining that he would be feted for his plays while Winnie-the-Pooh was forgotten. So it's lucky that the Cartoon Museum, near the British Museum, has another month of its exhibition of Searle's work \u2013 happily including a few St Trinian's and Molesworths. It will be the last chance for us to see some of his finest work. \u2712 I've been overwhelmed by your response to my piece about cliches in detective shows. I'll do more next week. In the meantime thanks to EW Grogan: \"If the opening scene is of a bulldozer on a building site or quarry, the next shot will uncover a body. If the opening shot is people messing about on a river, the next shot will show a body hidden in the reeds.\" Cliche lines, from Lucy Fisher: \"Suspect: 'I went for a walk'. Detective: 'In the middle of the night? In a snowstorm?'\" \"By rights, I ought to take you off this case\"; \"My private life is no concern of yours!\"; \"Please don't try to be funny, inspector. It doesn't suit you.\" Willie Stackpool reminds me of the crowded pub, from which the old geezer reels away saying: \"I know what I saw.\" He never makes it home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
