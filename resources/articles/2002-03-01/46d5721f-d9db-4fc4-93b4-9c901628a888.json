The Dutchman scored twice with identical free-kicks and furthermore set up Bonaventure Kalou for his goal to exact some revenge for his spell in Glasgow when the Parkhead club had to play second fiddle to their Old Firm rivals. Not that Feyenoord, who had Patrick Paauwe sent off after giving away a 54th-minute penalty, had it all their own way in a remarkable fourth-round tie, for the Ibrox team actually scored first through Neil McCann, who was also ordered off after receiving a second yellow card in 72 minutes, and again through Barry Ferguson's penalty kick that took the tie to the wire. Rangers, indeed, squandered outstanding chances to win it. \"The players are devastated because they know they should be through,\" said their manager Alex McLeish. \"I am annoyed with McCann because we had them on the ropes but gave them a get-out-of-jail card. \"As for the Van Hooijdonk goals, I thought the free-kicks were debatable in the first place and it's particularly hard when someone goes down and then gets up to take the free-kick.\" McCann had justified his surprise inclusion with a brilliant finish from Ferguson's clever free-kick after 25 minutes and that was probably no more than Rangers deserved for they had been denied an 11th-minute penalty after a clumsy Paauwe challenge on Peter Lovenkrands. Feyenoord had threatened through Robin van Persie on the left and Shinji Ono should have done better than head one of Van Persie's crosses over. It was no surprise, then, when the hard-pressed Tony Vidmar was booked for a foul on the winger after 29 minutes. Five minutes later McCann picked up his first yellow card for a challenge on Tomasz Rzasa. The pressure built on Rangers and after 37 minutes Van Hooijdonk scored the first of his well executed free-kicks after a Scott Wilson foul on the big striker. Another significant blow came two minutes later when Ronald de Boer, always a bit of a risk after battling to recover from a foot injury, had to give up the unequal struggle and was replaced by Michael Mols. Worse followed a minute from half-time when Van Hooijdonk waited while Lorenzo Amoruso complained long and bitterly over the decision to award a foul for a Vidmar tackle on Van Persie before he dispatched a carbon-copy free-kick - from the same place into the same corner - past Stefan Klos. A minute after the restart it was 3-1. Van Persie taunted Vidmar yet again and then sent a shot crashing off the post only for Van Hooijdonk to react quickest and send the ball back into the area, where Kalou headed home. The referee Herbert Fandel made it interesting again by awarding a penalty after Paauwe's silly challenge on Mols and since he was the last man he also saw red. Ferguson stepped up as he had in the first match to beat Edwin Zoetebier from the spot. The drama was unremitting and Lovenkrands missed an outstanding chance after being set up by Claudio Caniggia, Amoruso failed to emulate Van Hooijdonk with a free-kick and Mols somehow fired wide when clean through. By that time McCann had taken the long walk to the dressing room after picking up another booking for dissent. Brett Emerton was booked for a foul on Lovenkrands and Feyenoord frantically counted down the remaining seconds to end Rangers' first post-Christmas European expedition in nine years. Feyenoord (4-4-2): Zoetebier; Emerton, Paauwe, Loovens (Sprockel, 85), Rzasa; Kalou (Samardzic, 76), Bosvelt, Van Wonderen, Van Persie (Elmander, 90); Ono, Van Hooijdonk. Rangers (4-3-3): Klos; Vidmar (Flo, 74), Wilson, Amoruso, Numan; De Boer (Mols, 39), Konterman, Ferguson; Caniggia, Lovenkrands, McCann.
