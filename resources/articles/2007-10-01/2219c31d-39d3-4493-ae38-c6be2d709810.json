He was born in Blackpool, the youngest of four siblings. While still a toddler, he was diagnosed with epilepsy and his early years were marked by serious seizures. It became clear that he also had what are now termed learning difficulties and behavioural problems (a diagnosis of autism later explained much of what was, at the time, imperfectly understood). As he grew, the strain on the family led to him being placed in a residential school for epileptics, where he remained until he reached 16. Stephen's upbringing, and the devoted support of his parents, endowed him with many virtues. He was hard-working, honest, reliable and generous. In spite of his limitations, he earned his own living - making beds for a company which employed people with disabilities. At work, he was popular, cheerful and helpful. His employment gave him a strong sense of self-worth, and he saved regularly from his modest income. Except for a spell in his late teens, he remained at home with his parents, until their deaths. From 2001 he lived alone in the family home, made possible by the support of his family. But he was proud of his independence. He remained barely literate, although he determinedly attended evening classes for most of his adult life. He always remembered family birthdays and spent hours writing cards. His progress was in small steps, but he was rightly proud of his achievements, the outcome of commitment and a refusal to admit defeat. Since his death, his family has been heartened by the comments from many who knew him. Stephen would have been surprised to find out how well he was regarded. He is survived by his two sisters and a brother."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
