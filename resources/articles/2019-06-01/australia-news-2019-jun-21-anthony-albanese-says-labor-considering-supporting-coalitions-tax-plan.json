But Albanese and key Labor MPs remain unconvinced the government has provided enough information to justify passing the third tranche of tax cuts, due to come into effect in 2024-25. \u201cWe are considering it, but one of the things we are waiting for, as well, is for the government to give us the information that we\u2019ve requested,\u201d Albanese told Channel Nine. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a blank cheque. And they won\u2019t say what cuts they will make. \u201cIf you are reducing revenue, you therefore have to reduce expenditure. We want to know what their plans are, what the proposed full deal is, not just half of it.\u201d Labor supports the increase to the low and middle-income tax offset and could be persuaded on the second stage, to lift the 19% tax threshold to $45,000. But the third stage, which would create a flat tax rate of 30% for earners between $45,000 and $200,000, has both the opposition and Senate crossbenchers, including One Nation, and Centre Alliance hesitating. Mathias Cormann has repeatedly ruled out the government splitting the package, presenting it as an all or nothing deal, while also flatly rejecting calls from the crossbench to negotiate. That has put the spotlight back on Labor at a time where the party is recalibrating its policy platform, including its position on tax, sparking claims of a divide. While some MPs are content to let the government \u201cown\u201d the tax package, and any economic ramifications which emerge from it, others see supporting the tax package in its entirety as an abandonment of Labor\u2019s policy platform of the last six years, particularly its rejection of trickle-down economics. Comments from Victorian backbencher Peter Khalil, saying Labor should support the whole package if the government won\u2019t split the bill, opened a new line of government attack, with Peter Dutton claiming Khalil was the only Labor MP \u201ctalking sense\u201d. But Labor MPs talked down claims of a divide ahead of Monday\u2019s shadow cabinet meeting, where the tax plan will be discussed, saying it was a \u201cconversation worth having\u201d but that nothing had been decided. \u201cThere is a broad expectation from the Australian people, that the first tranche of tax cuts should be supported but, after that, the second and third tranche, it gets very murky, very quickly, in terms of the Coalition actually articulating the need for it,\u201d Queensland Labor MP Graham Perrett said. \u201cThere is no urgency [for the second and third stages] and the economic conditions have deteriorated significantly since the ballot boxes closed at 6pm on May 18. Or perhaps, there was a misrepresentation of the grim state of the Australian economy by the government before election \u2013 and all the data supports that characterisation. \u201cFresh economic data is the best way to consider decisions we make now, for tomorrow and that is worth discussing.\u201d The New South Wales MP Ed Husic said he remained unconvinced that \u201chanding such a large slab of money to the high-income earners\u201d was fiscally sustainable and the government was yet to explain how it planned on funding the hit to the budget, but that Labor would make its decision as a caucus. But he challenged the idea the government had a mandate to pass the third stage of tax cuts. \u201cThe Coalition never respect anyone else\u2019s mandate, so why do they expect us to fall in line here, by claiming to have one over their tax cuts?\u201d he said. \u201cThey are claiming a mandate on something they haven\u2019t fully costed or explained.\u201d The shadow minister, Andrew Giles, said he too remained unconvinced \u201cby any policy or political rationale which would lead me to support tranche three\u201d. The government will introduce its tax legislation in when parliament resumes early next month. Without Labor, it needs four of the crossbench votes, with One Nation, Centre Alliance and Jacqui Lambie emerging as the balance of power."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
