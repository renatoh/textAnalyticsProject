Carberry, who had pleaded not guilty to the charge of engaging in threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour likely to lead to a breach of the peace, was released on bail pending a possible appeal against his conviction. Carberry, champion jumps jockey in Ireland in 2002, was returning from a holiday with a group of 14 companions on an Aer Lingus flight from Spain to Dublin when he set light to a copy of the Irish Times belonging to Paul Condon, who was sitting next to him. The plane was at a height of 12,000ft when the incident occurred and, while the flames were extinguished a few seconds later, Judge Patrick Brady told Swords District Court yesterday that significant distress had been caused to other passengers. Judge Brady also told Carberry that he had found his evidence to the court on the matter \"contrived\" and rejected the jockey's claim that the incident had been a \"freak accident\". \"Would the defendant, an experienced jockey, have acted similarly in a stable or a transporter, containing straw and hay?\" Judge Brady said. \"I would suggest emphatically not.\" \"I would be failing in my duty if I did not mark the offence,\" the judge added, before sentencing Carberry to two months' jail and fining him \u20ac500 (\u00a3340). The jockey made no comment as he emerged from the court 30 minutes later after paying bail of \u20ac1,000. Carberry will be able to continue race-riding while he waits for his appeal, but if the conviction is confirmed he could be declared a disqualified person for a fixed period by the Irish Turf Club and lose his licence. \"If there is a conviction, the licensing committee will have to look at the implications,\" Denis Egan, the Club's chief executive, said yesterday. \"It would be premature to surmise.\" An exceptional horseman and a fearless jockey, Carberry was born to ride over the big fences at Aintree and won the 1999 Grand National on Bobbyjo, trained by his father Tommy, who won the same race on L'Escargot in 1975. It has been well known for years, though, that Tommy Carberry's famous appetite for post-race celebrations had also been passed down to his son, although Judge Brady said yesterday that he accepted Carberry had not been drunk at the time of the incident. \"He was fully compos mentis,\" the judge said. \"There was no excuse.\" On the Derby front, there were no significant moves in the betting yesterday but Bill Gredley, the owner of Olympian Odyssey, the intended mount of Jamie Spencer, said he is \"leaning towards Epsom\" on June 3 rather than the French Derby at Chantilly the following day. \"The natural instinct is to go to the Derby at Epsom, but we would have a worry if it ended up as a bog,\" Gredley said. \"This is a very willing horse, but we really don't know if he will stay a mile and a half - and with the attitude he has, going there on very testing ground might be asking too much.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
