He must know that police officers, like soldiers, are but \"citizens in uniform\". They are therefore subject to the ordinary law. It would be quite wrong to make an exception in their favour on the ground of expense, or indeed on any other ground. There is, however, another reform of the law which I support, which would be of great benefit to individual police officers. If a police officer fires with intent to kill, he is guilty of murder unless he has some defence. If he fires in the \"agony of the moment\" he may have no defence in law. But it would seem much too harsh to sentence him to life imprisonment, as the judge would be obliged to do. A life sentence in every case of murder should no longer be mandatory. It should be left to the judge to impose a life sentence, including a whole sentence, when required. But otherwise he should be free to impose the appropriate determinate sentence, whatever it might be, as in all other crimes.
