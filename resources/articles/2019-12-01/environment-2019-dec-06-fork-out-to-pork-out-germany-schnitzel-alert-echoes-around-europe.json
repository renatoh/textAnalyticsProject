BVDF, the federal association of the German meat industry, warned consumers that price rises meant some of their favourite national specialities, such as schnitzel and bratwurst, were going to be more expensive over Christmas. \u201cSausage is definitely more expensive,\u201d the association\u2019s president, Sarah Dhem, told German newspaper Bild. Chorizo manufacturers in Spain are also worried about the rise. \u201cYes, prices for raw materials have risen a huge amount,\u201d said a spokesperson at Loza, one of Spain\u2019s major producers. \u201cThey have gone up by 40% and all producers are deciding how to deal with this problem. But this is the busiest time of year for us, so I don\u2019t really have time to talk right now.\u201d Even in Denmark, one of the world\u2019s foremost producers of pork \u2013 and the home of Danish Bacon \u2013 admits it may have a problem. \u201cWe have also met higher prices from our suppliers,\u201d said a spokesperson for Salling Group, one of the country\u2019s largest retailers. \u201cBut we are trying to keep our prices towards customers as competitive as possible, not least during the Christmas season.\u201d The price rises are due to the African swine fever crisis in China. The epidemic is expected to wipe out half of China\u2019s pig population by the end of the year, prompting frantic buying of world supplies by the country. In September, EU pork exports were up 75% on the same month last year. European prices have risen steeply, as have prices in Brazil, which has been making up some of the shortfall. In some European countries the problems caused by pork price rises are being compounded by outbreaks of African swine fever, which means that exports from certain zones are banned. In Poland, for example, the industry has described the high prices as \u201carmageddon\u201d. But not everyone has bad news. The Italian Parma ham consortium says that although, as elsewhere in Europe, prices for standard pork products have risen by about 40%, the specialist pigs that they use are not particularly popular in China. \u201cOur pig is too expensive for them.\u201d And in the UK prices have been higher than Europe for some time, so to some extent the continent is just catching up. \u201cPrice rises?\u201d said Mark Thomas of Emmett\u2019s Ham, the oldest artisan ham and bacon producer in the UK. \u201cWe\u2019re just seeing the usual healthy sales that we always have at this time of year.\u201d Additional reporting by Cecilia Ferrara"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
