In most of mine, I'm looking cheeky compared to my brother and sister. I was a mummy's boy. A licensed middle child. A performer. When I was six I saw Charlie Drake doing a live TV sketch where he got hit on the head with a vase. He was knocked semi-unconscious and they had to stop the broadcast. My family wasn't troubled by much dysfunction. The most hotly contested issue was probably 'Who is going to have the most peas?' Consequently, I haven't got much time for angst. Anything that happens to you is your own responsibility. In my day you had to woo with letters. From 15 onwards I was obsessed with getting off with girls. I had a gap-year job on the P&amp;O ship Uganda working with 600 Canadian school girls. It was St Trinians at sea. Afterwards, I found myself writing to eight of them. I eventually lost my virginity to Jill and then lost interest. Shabby of me. Very shabby. Love happens when you're not looking. My wife Jo and I met on Not The Nine O'Clock News. She had to throw a bucket of water over me for a photo. That was the start of our 25 years. You don't realise that you're turning into your dad. My parents didn't have an enormous amount of life outside the family. In consequence I'm very domesticated. I like building a nest. People who need a fairy tale relationship will fail. They'll have an affair or seek extra-curricular entertainment. Relationships work when they're balanced and no one is too demanding. When I joined the BBC in 1976 it was like joining an army regiment. The corridors reeked of impoverished commitment. It was still important what regiment in the army you had served in. Not The Nine O'Clock News discovered an uncharted land - the TV youth audience. Sometimes we got 18m viewers. The floodgates opened. Mel Smith and I sat on the sidelines and thought: 'We can't afford to balls this up. Let's write some sketches.' Mel and I genuinely get on. It's like another marriage. He is very straightforward and never loses his rag. I run around in a frenzy most of the time. London cabbies will say to me, 'Your mate Mel's a miserable bastard', but he's far more grounded than me. We need a corrective on who is a genuine artist. I'm an opportunist. I have no talent. That's true of 99 per cent of people in the British media. Ricky Gervais or Graham and Arthur who wrote Father Ted or Armando Iannucci are God-like as they have talent. Everyone else is a drone. Like my father I find excessive social demands very boring. At 50 you go 'Fuck!' Where did the last 30 years go? The average middle-aged man settles down, starts a family and then realises he has no friends. He then becomes disappointed when the family turns on him and says, 'You're useless and boring.' You need to cultivate interests. As a child you go out and play and you lose all track of time and space. It's harder and harder to attain that blissful state of absorption as you get older. I did a six-month sailing trip to St Petersburg with some mates just to get it back. For me real peace is lying on a river bank in summer with a sprig of grass in my mouth. I have friends who jet off to a luxury hotel. I think, 'How can you enjoy such ghastly luxury?' My dad withdrew his hand from mine on his deathbed. I thought it must mean something dark. But my wife said: 'He's off his head on morphine, he doesn't know what he's doing.' What people elevate to the level of high sincerity often isn't. If my father had engaged in a sobbing hug, I don't think we would have gained anything from it apart from a feeling of ridiculousness. And being false. \u00b7 Griff Rhys Jones's memoir Semi-Detached: Pulling Up Roots in Suburbia, is published by Michael Joseph, \u00a320"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
