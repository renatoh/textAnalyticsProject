In the biggest Chinese investment outside London, Sheffield city council announced that an initial \u00a3220m would pay for four or five city centre projects over the next three years and create \u201chundreds if not thousands\u201d of jobs in south Yorkshire. The partnership is between Sheffield city council and Sichuan Guodong Construction Group, one of the biggest firms in China\u2019s south-western Sichuan province. The deal is seen as highly significant at a time of political uncertainty around Britain\u2019s trading relationship with China following the vote to leave the European Union. Julie Dore, leader of Sheffield city council, said: \u201cThis is the biggest Chinese investment deal to be made by a UK city outside of London. And perhaps more importantly, it is the first deal of its kind to be made by a UK city. This is a real partnership. \u201cThe projects funded by this investment will be determined by Sheffield city council, and the 60-year commitment secures a stream of investment into our city for the next generation, and means a whole range of projects become viable because of the long-term nature of the relationship. \u201cAt a time of unprecedented uncertainty and turmoil on the national political scene, we have taken the bull by the horns and led by example. We have the skills and the connections to drive economic growth in our city.\u201d Council bosses did not reveal which projects are to be funded by the first tranche of investment, insisting that \u201csensitive negotiations\u201d are continuing. It is thought, however, that the money will be used to fund the city\u2019s first five-star hotel, as well as new office and leisure developments and both high-end and affordable housing in the city centre. The total value of the deal was \u201cpotentially billions\u201d over 60 years, a council spokeswoman said. The deal, which took 18 months to thrash out, is the biggest Chinese cash injection in the north of England to date and follows George Osborne\u2019s oft-repeated desire to get the country\u2019s financial muscle behind his \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d project. Chinese officials have said they are open to launching trade negotiations with Britain in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, but there remains uncertainty about how Theresa May\u2019s government will seek to do business with Beijing. Experts have predicted the beginning of the end of the so-called \u201cgolden era\u201d fostered by the former chancellor, who last year unveiled plans to make Beijing Britain\u2019s second biggest trade partner by 2025. Osborne was seen to have wooed China by stressing trade and investment rather than human rights. Experts believe that Theresa May and her chancellor, Philip Hammond, will take a cooler approach, albeit under greater pressure to strike trade deals with non-EU countries. Next week, a delegation of Manchester\u2019s business and civic leaders, including the council chief executive, Sir Howard Bernstein, and the council leader, Sir Richard Leese, will fly out to Beijing in an attempt to secure further Chinese investment in the city. On Monday, executives will rub shoulders at Beijing\u2019s Bird\u2019s Nest stadium while watching Manchester United\u2019s pre-season friendly against Manchester City. The trip follows Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s state visit to London and Manchester last October, in which David Cameron announced the launch of direct flights from Manchester \u2013 the UK\u2019s second biggest airport \u2013 to Beijing. Chinese investment in the north has followed Osborne\u2019s overtures, though the Sheffield deal is by far the biggest cash pledge to date. Last September, the Hualing Group agreed to invest a reported \u00a360m in the building of apartment blocks at Middlewood Locks in Salford, the Thorpe Park business zone in Leeds and a digital campus in Sheffield in a deal with the developer Scarborough Group. The Beijing Construction and Engineering Group (BCEG) has agreed to fund \u00a34m to help kickstart the building at Middlewood Locks. The firm is also understood to have invested around \u00a315m in St Michael\u2019s area of Manchester city centre in a project spearheaded bythe ex-footballers Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs. BCEG in 2013 spent \u00a312m on a 20% stake in Airport City, a new commercial district close to Manchester airport whose construction would cost \u00a3800m to complete."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
