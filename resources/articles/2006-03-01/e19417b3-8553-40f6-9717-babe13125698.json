A century on, and even the most rheumy-eyed nostalgic will have to concede that we are living in times every bit as wonderful, and ratcheted up in tempo at least fourfold - or more than eight runs an over, as we witnessed almost in disbelief at the Wanderers in Johannesburg last weekend. Never have so many people gathered at the boundary or in front of their television sets to watch a game that, not so long ago, was seen to be creaking under the weight of its own two-runs-an-over mediocrity. When the BBC's TV coverage came to an end after 60 years in 1998 as the England and Wales Cricket Board rushed into the younger arms of Channel 4, Trevor Bailey was moved to counter the claim by the arrivistes that cricket was 'a thrilling and exciting game'. That was how Channel 4's boss, Michael Jackson, announced the new age - and 'Boil', so representative of another era, replied (on behalf of Test Match Special, the corporation and every vicar in every village in the land): 'Cricket is not a thrilling and exciting game all the time. You couldn't have a match which goes on for five days, six hours per day, thrilling and exciting every minute. It's essentially a situation game and it's the situation which creates the excitement, not television.' Tell it to the kids who watched The Ashes last summer, Trevor. Tell it to Sky, the new usurpers, whose commitment borders on the evangelical. Reviled Rupert's boys covered 31 days of cricket in 1991, 47 in 1994, 128 in 1999, 182 in 2004 - and last year pumped out 2,708 hours of coverage from all corners of the cricketing world, an increase of 12 per cent. They covered 19 Tests, 43 one-day internationals and more than 50 domestic matches. When we asked the BBC for a comparison of their coverage in the 'good old days', we were dismissed huffily by a PR flack who said she didn't have the resources to look it up. The reality is they did well in their own terms - brilliantly, in fact - but they ignored any game that did not feature England, and did not venture abroad for live coverage. Their flagship has always been the crackling quirkiness of Test Match Special. The wireless in the corner of the living room is still a comfort to many. But it is not the way forward. So, as the Indian cricket empire expands almost before our eyes, and as the game takes a grip on the public imagination few would have thought possible in some of the grimmer days of past summers, it is clear there is no turning back. And key to the revolution is the attitude of the players. They have proved remarkably adaptable to innovations and are almost unrecognisable from those fine old troupers of Victorian England. You would hardly think the clattering thrash of the modern game was in any way related to the stiff and upright fare on offer then - but it is the same animal, and that is the magic of cricket. Its essential charm remains in place, whatever the changes. Take the events in South Africa over the past seven days. A week later, and people are still talking about the extraordinary one-day match between South Africa and Australia, a game that will come to be regarded not as an aberration but a look into the future. As hard as it was to comprehend at the time that 872 runs were scored in a day, albeit on a flat track and small ground against mediocre bowling, it is not fanciful to believe we will see it repeated. Certainly it is likely in the shortened form of the game. But could we one day see something similar in a Test match? Maybe not. More likely, we will see a steady acceleration of the run-rate in Tests - a trend started by Australia over the past decade and copied by nearly everybody else - to the point where six runs an over will be considered the norm. That would deliver 540 runs in a day. In exceptional circumstances, teams might score 600 or more. And then the game will have witnessed a transformation that began in the 1960s and, more dramatically, has been taken a level further with the arrival of Twenty20. It is the 40-over game that has changed the 100-over version. Logic suggests that players who grow up in this helter-skelter environment will soon enough forget the sedate ways of the past. To Bailey and other traditionalists, this is an heretical notion that flies in the face of what they hold to be an unshakeable truth: four-innings Test matches are minor wars, ground out over five days, the ultimate examination of heart and body. As Ashley Giles remarked recently, the team bowling a quarter or more of their overs as maidens usually win. And the reason he says this is that teams scoring their runs at nearly four runs an over leave themselves more time to bowl out the opposition twice. So, from the Wanderers to Cape Town, where the argument for the old guard was well put these past few days. South Africa struggled to 205 in 63.5 overs; Australia replied with 308 in 87.2 overs. Then on Friday, as the second Test went into the trenches, Brett Lee bowled a spell of cut and speed that not only took the breath away but very nearly Graeme Smith's head. This, said the purists, was the real thing. Quite right - but what other sport could accommodate two such contrasting forms of the same discipline? Keith Miller lived in a swaggering, post-war age of devil-may-care cricket, yet in his Test career he was never hit for six. One of Herschelle Gibbs' most spectacular scoring shots last Sunday was a swept six - off the toe of his bat. The cudgels have moved on, from planks to energy-charged wands. For better or worse, we're all in a hurry these days. It's about image, glamour, presentation. Jonathan Agnew, bemoaning cricket's move away from the BBC eight years ago, remarked: 'The quality of coverage that everyone in the world has, I think, aspired to as far as the BBC is concerned has come to an end at a stroke.' And what a stroke it was Aggers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
