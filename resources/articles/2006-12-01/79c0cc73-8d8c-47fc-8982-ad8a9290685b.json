Reo-Coker was said to have been under-performing under the former Hammers manager Alan Pardew, who was sacked by the club's new chairman, Eggert Magnusson, last Monday. Within 48 hours Pardew had been replaced by Alan Curbishley, who won his first match in charge courtesy of Reo-Coker's 75th-minute goal against Manchester United on Sunday. That was not enough to entirely endear Reo-Coker to a West Ham crowd angered by the perception that he considers their club too small for his ambitions. He has, however, convinced his colleagues of his commitment. \"That shows his character,\" said Anton Ferdinand. \"He had been getting stick all week and for him to come out on top like that, not many people can do that. It shows how big a player he is and how much he has come along. \"He is my mate on and off the pitch and I am there for him 100%. I have seen the shit that he has taken and I think it is unfair. People forget how old he is. Football is not an age game but he is only 22 and captain of a massive club. For people to put the sacking of the manager on his shoulders is very unfair. But his performance against United shows that he lets his feet do the talking.\" The goalkeeper Robert Green echoed Ferdinand's supportive statement. Though he did not mention Reo-Coker by name, it was clear to whom he was referring. \"I think for certain individuals who have been singled out it has been harder than for others,\" said the England goalkeeper. \"Some have been unfairly singled out for criticism and blamed for the manager's departure. But to blame it on one player when there are 11 players out on the pitch is incredibly harsh. \"We take responsibility as a whole for the games and for the performances. It hadn't been happening for us but against United we have shown that it can happen and what we have to do to make it happen.\" Reo-Coker also received hate mail during the club's recent slump, his agent said yesterday. \"It got to a boiling point for a young man,\" said Reo-Coker's agent Tony Finnigan. \"That was the latter part of the week. I just told him to stick it in the dustbin and get ready to go to war against one of the best teams in Europe.\" Speculation has linked Reo-Coker with a number of top clubs and Finnigan said he would be requesting talks with Curbishley. \"He is under contract and he is happy there. But I don't know how long he wants to play in front of boos,\" he told Radio Five Live. Curbishley admitted he thought he \"might need counselling\" after the United game and must have been hoping he could steer his team through the flurry of fixtures before the new year without too much ground being lost on his rivals. The West Ham manager had been looking to Dean Ashton, who has missed all of the season with a broken ankle, as almost a messianic saviour but after Sunday's result the \u00a37.5m striker can now be regarded through less desperate eyes. Which is just as well because, having expected to call on Ashton within a month, it emerged yesterday that West Ham will have to do without him for at least another eight matches. \"I'm told that Dean will not begin serious training until the end of January or even early February,\" said Curbishley yesterday. The Preston manager Paul Simpson has agreed a contract extension that will keep him at the club until 2011. Simpson signed a three-year deal when he was appointed in the summer but his efforts in guiding North End to third in the Championship have been rewarded with an extra 24 months. The news was announced at the club's agm yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
