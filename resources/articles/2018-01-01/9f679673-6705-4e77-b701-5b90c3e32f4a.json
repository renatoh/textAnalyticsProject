On New Year\u2019s Day at the Byron Bay edition, the all-female act had issued an on-stage call-out against the festival\u2019s lack of female artists in top billing slots \u2013 and this week they doubled down, printing T-shirts for acts and fans to express their solidarity and engaging with the discussion, and backlash, across social media. While it was met with a mixed and highly criticised response from the Falls team itself, which in part encouraged the band to \u201cgo out and start their own events\u201d, the call-out provoked essential dialogue and brought a large, curious and engaged crowd to their Fremantle set, over at the slightly tucked away (and yes, smaller) Valley Stage. \u201cI feel like we had every right to call out Falls festival and then they gave them this bullshit response; who cares,\u201d band member Georgia Maq told the Western Australian audience. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to book to play your festival an outspoken feminist band, you\u2019re gonna get an outspoken feminist band. \u201cIt\u2019s not about filling a quota. It\u2019s not about all that fucking rubbish, the \u2018diversity bandwagon\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s about the type of world we want to see in music. We want an equal and inclusive and diverse music community ... it\u2019s bullshit, and we\u2019ve had enough of it.\u201d They previewed new songs from the forthcoming LP, How to Socialise &amp; Make Friends (the new context makes that title even better), as well as songs such as The Opener, which had elicited the initial call to arms in the first place \u2013 a move which has since been supported by fellow artists including Jen Cloher, Julia Jacklin, Bad Dreems and Thundamentals. The Valley Stage itself was surrounded by markets and microsites that reflected contemporary Fremantle and WA music, with Perth hip-hop collective the Community showcasing performances by Mathas, Diger Rokwell, YLEM and Arms In Motion. Staunch Freo live music venues Mojo\u2019s and Clancy\u2019s featured sets from household-names-in-the-making Timothy Nelson, Callum Kramer, Lucy Peach and many more, reflecting a warm and natural embrace of the locale by the Falls booking team. Saturday afternoon\u2019s set by Perth go-getters Methyl Ethel provided a perfect soundtrack on Stage One as the Fremantle Doctor breezed in. Last year was spent mostly overseas for this band who clearly felt right at home bringing it on home. On this occasion \u2013 due to injury \u2013 the band featured indomitable stand-in guitar/bass/keys player Stella Donnelly who handled the duties with aplomb. Daryl Braithwaite could have been considered this year\u2019s ironic inclusion, but the love was there from this younger audience for the Aussie legend. While a good deal of the crowd may have been waiting for one particular song, Braithwaite and his cracking band mixed it up with his solo hits \u2013 Rise, As the Days Go By and One Summer \u2013 and an explosive turn through Sherbet\u2019s cricket anthem, Howzat. It was, however, the song everybody was waiting for that truly provided the afternoon delight: Horses was the soundtrack to an ecstatic love-in singalong. Allday, who followed Braithwaite, didn\u2019t stand much of a chance and didn\u2019t look like he wanted to either. As Saturday afternoon turned into evening the Smith Street Band brought their pub-band-writ-large appeal to a set that included a suitably rousing version of the Killers\u2019 When You Were Young. The colourfully upbeat sounds of Glass Animals were bookmarked by the more contemplative and ethereal feels of Angus and Julia Stone and Fleet Foxes. Both were sublime, but at times one could sense the crowd was hankering for some Saturday night EDM. They got that with Flume, who for all purposes looked like a guy dancing around his laptop in his bedroom, but they certainly loved him for it. Meanwhile, at the Valley Stage, Anna Lunoe brought a ripping set to about 100 lucky people. Day two of Falls Downtown was a little more free-flowing than Saturday, which had seen complaints aired regarding the long entry queues. With wristbands sorted and people already aware of their bearings, Bad//Dreems and Dune Rats roused those who weren\u2019t yet fully awake and set the scene for the Sunday ahead. At Stage Two, Vince Staples peered out at the crowd, all bums-on-shoulders and hands in the carefree air, and seemed to be confronting demons both sound-wise and of his own making. A shorts-clad Liam Gallagher, meanwhile, was \u2018avin it. Oasis\u2019s Fuckin\u2019 in the Bushes belted through the PA as he swaggered on and announced \u201cRock\u2019n\u2019roll star\u201d into the mic \u2013 both a greeting and statement \u2013 before rolling into his old band\u2019s anthem. \u201cWe only get an hour but that\u2019s OK \u2013 we only need one,\u201d he snarled and proceeded to wave his tambourine as orange Manchester flares went off in the crowd. Solo songs such as Wall of Glass hit the spot but the likes of Morning Glory and Gallagher\u2019s own \u201cHorses\u201d moment in Wonderwall couldn\u2019t be argued with. Sunday evening sailed on with Peking Duk bringing their live show to the masses. This was Nirvana (both band and existential status) for the crowd who revelled like it was one big backyard party. That party kicked on with a sprightly set from Brit outfit the Kooks and ended with a more urgent, banter-filled finale from Run the Jewels, that surprisingly failed to connect. Whether it was their mood or the fact that Monday morning was calling, the weekend\u2019s energy had dissipated somewhat, but the best memories of Falls Downtown had no doubt already been made as the happy masses lumbered back out into the streets of Fremantle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
