Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference in Bournemouth as his party begins its campaign for the UK to stay within the EU, the former Lib Dem leader will say that the upcoming vote on Britain\u2019s EU membership will pose an existential question to the British people. \u201cNot just one, but two, unions now hang in the balance. If we vote to leave the EU, I have no doubt that the SNP will gleefully grab the opportunity to persuade the people of Scotland to leave the UK as well,\u201d he is expected to say. \u201cDo we want our children and grandchildren to live in a once-great country now pulled apart? A Great Britain turned into a little England, drifting friendlessly somewhere in the mid-Atlantic?\u201d Holding a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union before the end of 2017 was a central Conservative party manifesto commitment at the general election. Although a date has not yet been set, David Cameron has started lengthy negotiations with other EU leaders in an attempt to agree new terms for the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe, including changing the rules to restrict EU migrants\u2019 access to British in-work benefits. Clegg, a former member of the European parliament, will say that the referendum will be contested on the issue of jobs, economic security and the terms of any renegotiation. \u201cBut there\u2019s a big, enduring question which hangs over all of this: what kind of country do we want to be, what is our role, in this globalised world of ours? Open or closed? Leading in our own European backyard or isolated from our nearest neighbours?\u201d The former Lib Dem leader, who resigned his position the day after the party lost 48 of its 56 MPs in May\u2019s general election, is expected to call on Jeremy Corbyn to be unequivocal about his support for the European project. \u201cOn a number of occasions in recent years I\u2019ve seen the Labour party abandon its progressive principles to score short-term tactical points: failing to support House of Lords reform; barely lifting a finger in the AV referendum; blocking party funding reform,\u201d he will say. \u201cBut I say to Jeremy Corbyn: the EU referendum is simply too important for ambivalence.\u201d Labour\u2019s position on the EU referendum was clarified last week when Corbyn committed the party to campaigning for reform from within the European Union. He had previously said he did not want to give David Cameron a blank cheque by guaranteeing that Labour would campaign for an in vote, arguing that there needed to be greater levels of social protection across Europe. Launching the Lib Dem\u2019s EU campaign, the party\u2019s leader, Tim Farron \u2013 who replaced Nick Clegg in July \u2013 will tell members that voting to remain in the EU would \u201csecure Britain\u2019s position as a world power and build on our role as a beacon of hope, freedom, tolerance and prosperity\u201d. \u201cIt is not the time to turn our backs on Europe, and leave us isolated, sidelined and alone,\u201d he will say. Speaking at a fringe meeting at the Lib Dem conference on Sunday, the former business secretary, Vince Cable, said that although he thought the referendum would ultimately end with a vote to stay in the EU, it could be much closer than has previously been predicted. He argued that the strength of Eurosceptic feeling on both the right and left was growing and that campaigners could not afford to be complacent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
