A meeting of the Yorkshire Flood Defence Committee in York voted unanimously to postpone a decision on whether to give the Environment Agency a 63% increase in its levy to pay for essential work for flood defences caused by November's devastating flooding. More than 2,500 homes were flooded in the region and more than a third of the total emergency response and repair costs for the whole of the country were incurred in the county. If the flood defence committee agrees to the levy increase it could mean a hike in council tax bills in the region of \u00a36 to \u00a310 per household per year. The Environment Agency told today's meeting it had submitted a bid for some of the \u00a351m funding promised by deputy prime minister John Prescott during the crisis. But committee chairman Roy Ward, who told the meeting the floods in Yorkshire were the worst for 400 years, said there had been no response from the government. Councillor Peter Sowray, representing North Yorkshire county council and the City of York council, told the committee: \"John Prescott came to Yorkshire and stood up to his waist in water and said 'Don't worry, we'll help'. \"We've got to keep him to his promises - he's not to be allowed to escape on that one.\" The Environment Agency says the increase, an extra \u00a310.8m on top of last year's levy of \u00a317.2m, was needed to avert another disaster. Emergency repairs to existing defences will cost \u00a32.8m, while \u00a37.8m has been added to the agency's existing \u00a315.1m capital programme for flood alleviation schemes. Recommending deferment of the decision, Jack Goodhand, a councillor representing Barnsley, Rotherham and Doncaster borough councils and Derbyshire county council, said: \"Local authorities are not inhuman bodies - we are concerned about what happened but we also have a responsibility to ensure that we look after all areas of the community.\" Environment Agency appointee Ian Bonas pointed out that any money the local authorities agree to provide will be reimbursed in their government funding next year. A flood defence committee in Solihull, West Midlands, last week voted to impose an extra 12% levy, sparking calls for government assistance by Labour councillors. The decision in Yorkshire has been deferred until a meeting in York on February 2."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
