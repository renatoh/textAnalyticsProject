It was a good, tight derby, spoilt at times by a whistle-happy referee. We were good value for the win, but unfortunately we couldn't finish \u2013 otherwise it could easily have been three or four. But in the end, we were the better side, created most of the chances, and their goalie [Richard Wright] made two or three cracking saves to keep the score down. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Nathan Doyle in midfield ran the show with a superb performance. Bobby Hassell produced a solid display at left-back, especially given that he's right-footed \u2013 and he also made a vital block at the end. Owen Scrimshaw, BFCST.org.uk Bristol City 2-0 Derby County Was it a good match? On a dull afternoon, this was a bright and open game with plenty of fine and exciting football. Derby are a good side, but we were better \u2013 it was our best home performance this season. David James was perhaps lucky to be shown only a yellow card in the first half, but he stayed on the pitch and helped us keep another clean sheet. Overall, this was a quality early Christmas present. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Albert Adomah and Brett Pitman were excellent and full of confidence, linking up superbly for both goals. Damion Stewart had a solid game at the back. Barry Hayes, Observer reader Burnley 2-3 Leeds United Was it a good match? Even though it was 2-0 at half-time, no one was surprised by what happened. We're our own worst enemies \u2013 we can't kill games off, and we've just not looked convincing at any stage of the season. It won't get any better until the Burnley board take a courageous decision and sack Brian Laws, who is a mediocre manager in charge of a good bunch of players. On paper, we've got a better team than Leeds, but in Simon Grayson they've got a better manager. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Jay Rodriguez was really good. For Leeds, Luciano Becchio was a cheat, hitting the deck every time he could. Andrew Firmin, LondonClarets.com Crystal Palace 0-0 Hull City Was it a good match? It wasn't the most exciting of games \u2013 certainly not the best choice for Sky to show on the box. We were solid enough at the back, but didn't get enough shots on target. We looked like we missed Darren Ambrose today, though it's always a concern when you're reliant on one player to win you the game. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Sean Scannell hasn't played for about a year, so it was good to see him back, but we're now going to lose James Vaughan, who's going back to Everton. Pablo Counago was pretty lively and made some good passes. Peter Guntrip, Holmesdale.net Leicester City 5-1 Doncaster Rovers Was it a good match? We got off to a poor start \u2013 they had two great chances and scored from one of them. They didn't have another effort on goal for the rest of the match. Lloyd Dyer has always been an impact sub, and though he came on earlier than he usually does, he certainly had an impact here. It was the softest penalty you'll ever see, but it was a bit of a turning point \u2013 we came out for the second half full of confidence and just battered them. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Richie Wellens was fired up against his former club and scored a rare goal. Andy King and Yuki Abe showed guts in the middle of the park alongside him. Joe Harris, Foxes-Mad.co.uk Middlesbrough 1-0 Cardiff City Was it a good match? We went back to the Boro way of picking up our game up against better opposition. It was quite a lively game \u2013 in the first half Craig Bellamy scored a goal but it was rightly given offside. I'm not convinced it was a penalty, to be perfectly honest, but we'll take it. In fact, there were a few incidents I'd like to see again, including a bit of handbags at the end. Our players took offence at a challenge on Jason Steele, but he didn't have hold of the ball and their player had a right to go for it. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Our makeshift back four really pulled together and worked for each other. Elle Brunton, Observer reader Norwich City 0-2 Portsmouth Was it a good match? It was such a disappointing and frustrating afternoon \u2013 one of those classic games where you have by far the majority of the possession, but don't take your chances and get caught cold. They rarely threatened, but hit us with a sucker-punch goal that was a really poor one to concede. We pushed for an equaliser and gave a penalty away through sheer frustration more than anything else. But we've been playing well lately and shouldn't be too disheartened about it. Who played well/who had a nightmare? I was impressed with Wes Hoolahan. Henri Lansbury, who's on loan from Arsenal, is a class act. Rachel Neil, NorwichCity.FootballUnited.com Preston North End 1-0 Ipswich Town Was it a good match? A much-needed result, and a good performance. In the first 20 minutes we weren't in the game at all, but then we started to show a bit of self-belief. Iain Hume, who is pivotal for us, started getting on the ball and caused their defence numerous problems. Ipswich were never out of it \u2013 Carlos Edwards was always a threat, and you could taste the relief when the ref blew his whistle. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Hume was easily our best player, but he's back at Barnsley as his loan's expired. There are rumours we've signed him but he'll be missed until 1 January. Mark Holt, Observer reader Reading 0-0 Coventry City Was it a good match? Without being rude it was an absolutely woeful game. We need investment and we need it fast. We just don't have a striker \u2013 it's like Shane Long goes to bed every night and wakes up every morning saying \"I had a dream about being a Championship striker\". No, mate \u2013 you are one. The guy had five clear-cut chances and he didn't take a single one of them. What more does he need to do to get himself dropped? If I performed that badly at work I'd get told to buck my ideas up. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Jobi McAnuff was getting good balls in, so our strikers certainly can't complain about a lack of service.
