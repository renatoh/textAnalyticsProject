Such tactics automatically attract wides in the one-day game and after his first four overs had disappeared for 32, to follow a six-over mauling in Calcutta in his only other appearance, some Indian observers were tempted to present it all as a kind of morality play: Giles, forced to return to normality, gets his comeuppance. The remarkable turnaround that followed, then, was presumably an unadulterated triumph for Birmingham's forces of evil. Giles, a big man prancing to the crease as gingerly as if stepping on hot coals, fell into his best slow left-arm rhythm of the winter as he summoned a second spell of five for 25 in six overs. India, poised to overhaul England's 271 for five, crashed to a two-run defeat, despite some plucky late hitting from Ajit Agarkar, and England will start 3-2 down under Bombay's lights on Sunday with the chance to draw the series. Kotla is the shabby cubbyhole of Indian grounds, a blight on the capital, and its reputation was further sullied when three England fielders - Michael Vaughan, Andrew Flintoff and Graham Thorpe - complained of being hit by pellets, presumably fired from a gun. The umpires suspended play for a minute or so while officials suggested to 5,000 policemen that they might like to do something about it. There are enough oranges and plastic bottles thrown at players during the average Indian one-day international to open a refreshment stall but pellet guns have the resonance of a Jamie Carragher. Nasser Hussain has seen too much of India to complain too vociferously. \"You get a lot of this sort of thing in this part of the world and most of it is high spirits,\" he said, \"but this was taking things a bit too far.\" An Indian series victory looked odds-on when Sourav Ganguly craftily requested a ball change with 92 needed from 15 overs and seven wickets intact. Darren Gough, who had begun to reverse-swing the old one, was so miffed that he acted as if to bite holes in the replacement, and then bit off Ganguly's head as he stomped past him for good measure. Hussain's recall of Giles was no masterstroke, merely his last recourse; Ganguly had battered him for three leg-side sixes in that opening spell. But Giles switched ends, went around the wicket for containment and, from the moment that Ganguly holed out at long-off, for 74 from 95 balls, flicked the switch on the Indian innings. Mohammad Kaif's debut caught the shirt-makers by surprise; his name was written on it in marker pen. For all that, he had chipped the ball around maturely in a century stand with Ganguly but on the loss of his captain he immediately drove to short extra. Giles struck again in his next three overs: Hemang Badani stretching to chip a return catch from the footholes; Ajay Ratra stumped by James Foster, who had fumbled an equally simple stumping chance off Vaughan early in Ganguly's innings; Anil Kumble, bowled, trying to sweep. Recalled only because Jeremy Snape had split the webbing on his bowling hand in Kanpur, Giles had become the twelfth England player to take five wickets in a one-day international; his five for 57 is the most expensive. Forty-five were needed from the last five overs but Agarkar's unbeaten 36 from 24 balls cut that to nine from the final over. In the end it came down to the last ball - a six off Gough to win it. But Gough's strut had become more confident with every ball and Agarkar could only carve two runs to the cover boundary. Andy Caddick's contribution was almost forgotten but it was he, in his first match of the series, who found extra bounce to have Sachin Tendulkar caught at the wicket. Caddick's first two overs disappeared for 19 but his last eight went for 20. Gough's capture of Virender Sehwag at slip, after a buccaneering 42 from 36 balls, removed England's other chief tormentor. England's batting acceleration had been held in abeyance first because of a hint of dampness, then by Hussain's conviction that they had paid for over-aggression in earlier matches and \"must delay their final onslaught a little bit\". Had India won, Hussain's 49 from 71 balls, and he needed an umpiring error to get that far, might not have found universal approval. As it was, Nick Knight's 105 from 131 balls and Flintoff's rustic 52 from 39 ensured a substantial total."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
