He looks as if he is stroking a white Persian cat under the desk, and he knows EVERYTHING. But even Mariani would not be able to make sense of this week's \"Just how stupid do they think we are?\" story. The Advertising Standards Authority has ruled that an ad claiming a beauty cream would destroy cellulite and melt away fat is misleading. Yes! Advertisement is misleading shock! Hold the front page, and drop that story about the Pope being a Catholic! Guys, listen: nobody honestly believes that applying a cream to fat or wrinkly parts of our bodies is going to make them slender and smooth. We know that if we are lucky enough to be slender and smooth early in life then bully for us, but if we drink and smoke and eat cream cakes and lie in the sun and ride motorcycles across Texas without a bandana, then we will mislay our slender smoothness and there's sod all we can do. So when we spend \u00a390 on a teenytiny pot of contouring lipo-seaweed stuff, we are buying a little fantasy. Look, we say, we may have buggered our complexions but see how glamorous we still are! Look at that fabulous packaging! And that price tag! That's the kind of woman I am, ooh, because I'm worth it. It's not about the product. We don't believe, as we gaze up at the billboard from the traffic jam, that if we buy a Saab convertible we'll get a free empty mountain road to drive it on. To be honest, I'm not sure when I last saw an advert that was legal, decent, honest and truthful. The fantasy world portrayed in advertising is so very far from reality that, in particular, honest and decent are hardly ever applicable. (It's dishonest, for example, the way the corporate world co-opts the personal, and in the act devalues it. Personal pleasures - favourite songs, the pleasure of changing gear on a mountain road, the little intimacies of a couple in a bathroom - are commodified as marketing devices. Everything becomes tainted. A waterfall still means Consulate; a black horse means banking. Give them back!) But does it matter, if we know that advertising is a load of bollocks? Well, yes. We may not believe the product promises, but the overall mood of advertising is more insidious, and inflicts real damage on the real world. Under the barrage of fantasy, people can begin to think that reality is meant to be like it looks in the adverts, and if yours isn't, you're a failure. As a nation we are hideously in debt. Our consumer spending is increasing exponentially. Is it really sensible to allow corporations to continue this unrestricted encouragement to consume? Has nobody noticed that things are running out? And as they are running out, we are being told, all over our streets and TVs and magazines, that we are not desirable, not up to scratch, not normal even, if we don't chuck out our chintz, give in to temptation and consume all the bloody time. Then there was a billboard by the M4 a while ago. A huge close-up of two bruised and bloodied black eyes. Beneath, in huge letters, \"Don't participate - Dominate\". What a message. From playground bullies to rapists, from international politics to international terrorism, from Gaza to Kabul to any home where a child or a woman is being beaten, what a message ... Anyway, wondering who in their right mind would think that a clever thing to stick up in a public place, I discovered that it was an advertisement for advertising. Advertise here and you will dominate your marketplace, or something. Legal, decent, honest and truthful. Hmmm. If the ASA were serious, it would ban the whole industry. No doubt Mariani will arrange it when he is king of the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
