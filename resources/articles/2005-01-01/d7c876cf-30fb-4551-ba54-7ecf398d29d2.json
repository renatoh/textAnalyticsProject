Despite the title, it's trying to be Distant Voices, Still Lives rather than Nil By Mouth. It's an obviously autobiographical story from Jobson, sometime punk singer, TV presenter and novelist, very well played by Kevin McKidd, Laura Fraser and Susan Lynch. Filmed on digital video, it's an impressionistic look at a life spent trying to escape from the hard man archetype. Like American Beauty and Desperate Housewives, it appears to be narrated by a corpse, though this, like much else, is never made entirely clear. It tips into the overly arty at times, but makes for a memorable debut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
