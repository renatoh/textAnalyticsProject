Speaking at the team's plush hotel in the north Durban resort of Umhlanga, where the players' wives, girlfriends and children have assembled for Christmas, the England coach admitted he was proud of the side's achievements but said it was vital that the festive spirit did not spill over into the Boxing Day Test at Kingsmead. \"You've got to be careful,\" he said. \"That's why we're going to the gym this morning. Every Test we play now, especially in a winning sequence, definitely becomes harder and harder. We've got to make sure we maintain our confidence and self-belief. \"If we sit back today and have a day off, you suddenly get a holiday feel developing. You think it's all easy.\" Fletcher has never been one for baubles and tinsel, although this has more to do with the fact that he spent the first 10 Christmases of his own career as a cricketer away from home representing what was then Rhodesia in the old Currie Cup than an inherent affinity with Ebenezer Scrooge. In that sense England are fortunate to have a coach who regards commitment as non-negotiable. \"I'm just concentrating on what's coming up in a few days' time,\" he said. \"There are times when I'm walking around with my wife and she's talking to me and I'm not even listening. She gets quite annoyed. You just turn things over in your mind, like what are we going to do in this Test match.\" With characteristic pragmatism, Fletcher refuses to indulge Australians who are already bored after one thumping win over Pakistan by looking ahead to next summer's Ashes. \"I don't think people understand how important it is - we've got a Test match starting on Boxing Day. If we start thinking too far ahead, we're going to lose our way. We have got to go 2-0 up.\" Fletcher believes the seeds for England's record run were sown over a year ago in Bangladesh, where Michael Vaughan implemented the new fitness regime that is now writ large on the team's calling-card. \"Before we used to just go out and pray that one or two of our bankers would produce the goods. Now we're quite confident that two or three different players will do something each time.\" Since the start of the sequence the only game in which no England player has hit a century has been the Oval Test against West Indies, but even then everyone reached double-figures to rack up 470. In all, eight different players have scored 14 hundreds, and 10 have made a further 23 fifties. The wickets have been spread out too: only two bowlers (Ashley Giles, twice, and Steve Harmison) have collected five-wicket hauls. \"The most important part is that we've hopefully got rid of the bad habits,\" said Fletcher. \"When things start to go wrong we used to fold. We've developed a side with a bit of mettle now. We're prepared to scrap in any situation. \"There is no doubt that there is scope for improvement after PE [Port Elizabeth], but we've had a lot of other wins when there's been scope for improvement, like during the summer against New Zealand. I just don't believe you can sit back and go, oh well, we've reached the ultimate. I don't think you ever reach the ultimate.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
