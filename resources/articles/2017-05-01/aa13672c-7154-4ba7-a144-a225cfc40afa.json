Henderson, 26, has not played for Liverpool since the 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur on 11 February having suffered another problem with the foot. He was sidelined last season by the heel condition plantar fasciitis in his left foot, and played on after the tissue ruptured, but has been ordered to rest by the medical staff this season having suffered several setbacks in his attempted recovery. Liverpool have only two matches remaining as they attempt to secure Champions League qualification, away at West Ham United on Sunday and at home to relegated Middlesbrough on the final day. Yet Klopp claimed Henderson\u2019s general fitness would enable him to return as soon as he receives the all-clear on his foot problem. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cIt is too early to say [the midfielder\u2019s season is over]. Next season is the latest moment, of course, but anything can happen. We stay positive because he is strong. The moment someone gives him the green light he will be back in a second because of his attitude and character. I am not thinking about the start of pre-season but that would be the latest moment he is back. \u201cYou wish a ligament had snapped. Then at least you know if you can fix it or if you have to wait for six, eight weeks or whatever. This is the kind of issue where you have to wait. That is how the body is sometimes. Jordan can manage really well. It was the medical department that said he has to rest. We still have to wait, that is all.\u201d Despite not playing a competitive game for three months, Henderson could be considered for England\u2019s World Cup qualifier against Scotland and friendly with France next month should he resume full training. Klopp admitted: \u201cWe have not made a final judgment for this season. We don\u2019t know if he will back tomorrow in training or next week but because it is Jordan and he has a really high fitness level, even if it just swimming, we know we can think about him immediately when he is ready. Then we could think about the national team. If he has games then he could play, if not it makes no sense, but we have not spoken [to England].\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
