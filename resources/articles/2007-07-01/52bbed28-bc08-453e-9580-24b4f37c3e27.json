The England striker talked in glowing terms of his early experiences under the new manager, Sam Allardyce, and said he had also been impressed by the new backroom staff, players and directors. \"I believe that these can be good times to be at Newcastle, which is why I am more than happy to be here,\" he said. \"There has been plenty of speculation about my future but I can assure the Newcastle fans that I didn't start any of it.\" He always ignored such talk, he added. \"I prefer to let my actions speak for themselves and I just wish there had been more opportunities to show the Newcastle fans what I am capable of,\" said the 27-year-old, who was injured for most of last season. \"I am sure that is to come this season.\" Owen said that \"everyone who has arrived appears to have big ambitions\" and that he would like to play a part in moving the club forward. \"There have been too many years of underachievement on Tyneside. This club have so much potential. I want to help realise it.\" Another Newcastle striker, Obafemi Martins, has said he will meet Allardyce tomorrow to discuss his future. Martins, touted for a \u00a313m move to either Arsenal or West Ham United, was speaking in Nigeria yesterday and said of recent speculation: \"Right now all I know is what I read in the papers. I have a meeting with the manager when I get back to training. We will see what happens then.\" The club's new owner, Mike Ashley, is set to complete his buy-out of Newcastle shares after triggering a compulsory purchase of the remaining stock. St James Holdings Limited, his company, revealed to the London Stock Exchange that it had reached agreement to buy almost 95% of shares by yesterday afternoon and that it would take up its option to force the remaining stockholders to sell up. It is expected the remaining purchases will be completed by the end of next month. Joey Barton, the Newcastle midfielder, was re-bailed yesterday by police investigating an alleged assault on a team-mate at his previous club, Manchester City, during a training-ground bust-up on May 1. Barton allegedly attacked the Frenchman Ousmane Dabo. He was due to answer bail today but was re-bailed until August 2 while police make further inquiries. City are believed to be back in the hunt for Arsenal's Freddie Ljungberg. They are understood to have held talks with the midfielder and his agent on Tuesday about a possible \u00a36m move to Eastlands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
