Any suggestions? Jersey, the most southerly of the Channel Islands, has one of Britain's best sunshine records. It's great in summer, when you can make the most of its sandy beaches, but is a good choice for a winter weekend, too. Where to stay? The island is short on chic hotels, so hooray for Eulah Country House, which opened this autumn. There isn't a reception desk; guests are given keys and can come and go as they like. What's the house like? Eulah was an Edwardian rectory that subsequently became a family home. It has a swimming pool, sun deck, pretty gardens and nine bedrooms, most of which have sea views. There is an emphasis on pointless, but splendid, luxury (one bath has a four-poster canopy). The whole place feels grand yet informal. Who's it aimed at? You would be well advised to take a car over on the ferry, since there are few restaurants within walking distance. You're a stump from the beach, too, so this isn't the place to take the kids for a bucket-and-spader. Eulah will be best enjoyed by people visiting the island on business - the house has fax and modem points - and grown-ups seeking a low-key, luxurious break. \u00b7 Eulah Country House, Mont Cochon, St Helier, Jersey JE2 3JA (01534 626626; email: eulah@jerseymail.co.uk) Luxury doubles start at \u00a3120 for single occupancy and \u00a3170 for double occupancy, including breakfast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
