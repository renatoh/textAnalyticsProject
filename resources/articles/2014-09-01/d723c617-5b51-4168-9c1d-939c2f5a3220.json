On the day this summer that Paul Miller took over the Orange Tree, the Arts Council announced it was stopping its grant to the theatre. A protest started, a campaign is welling. I hope it succeeds. Run for 42 years by its founder Sam Walters, this is the first purpose-built in-the-round theatre in London. It\u2019s on the fringe but not of it. Small but solidly built, drawing on the bourgeois-bohemian audience of Richmond, it has never been edgy. Which does not mean it has not been innovative. I remember so clearly the first time I went there, 19 years ago. It was to see V\u00e1clav Havel\u2019s The Memorandum, a drama which had a political force, and a metaphysical reach, and which starred a young and wonderful Victoria Hamilton. I was so near to the front row that I could have touched her tears. That closeness and seriousness are the making of this theatre. Now Miller has programmed an intriguing first season: a mixture of old and new. There will be dramas by Bernard Shaw and Deborah Bruce and an appearance by Helen Baxendale. Miller begins with a fine production of The Widowing of Mrs Holroyd. DH Lawrence\u2019s 1914 play has nothing to do with the war. Except the war fought between men and women. You might see in this story of a woman shackled to a brutish bloke the beginnings of kitchen-sink drama. Ironing is as central to the placing of characters as it was in Look Back in Anger, produced 42 years later. You can certainly see the preoccupations of Lawrence\u2019s novels and life: the woman who considers herself better than the man to whom she is married; the coarse-grained fellow who since he is all muscle and no mind, exerts some magnetism; chaps knocking each other about. Katherine Mansfield squealed that the play was \u201cblack with miners\u201d. When the body of one them comes to be washed by his mother and wife, the scene looks like a deposition. Attitudes and customs slipping out of living memory come to bristling life: the men who glared over their whiskers; the miners\u2019 wives who put by a pair of white stockings in which to lay out their men. \u201cEverybody has it, sooner or later,\u201d says a grief-hardened mother, talking of pit death. As the mother, Polly Hemingway gives the performance of the evening, rigid in body and face, all expression in the smacking and pursing of her lips. The Widowing of Mrs Holroyd is at the Orange Tree, Richmond until 4 October"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
