The England forward has been out since last spring but is still not close to returning. \u201cUnfortunately he was injured at the end of April and we are now at the end of December and he is still not available because of a bone bruising. That deteriorated and it is a big blow to us,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cEspecially now we cannot rotate.\u201d Being without Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Theo Walcott recently has put a strain on Arsenal\u2019s attacking options and Wenger is frustrated to be short of a key forward player as versatile as Welbeck. Jack Wilshere is marginally ahead of his projected return. Wenger suggested the midfielder, who like Welbeck is yet to play at all this season, could return towards the end of January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
