Jim O\u2019Neill, the former commercial secretary to the Treasury, said the plan to rebalance the UK\u2019s economy appeared to be back on the government\u2019s agenda following the resignation of Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill in June. \u201cIt may be complete coincidence, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not, that since they\u2019ve gone there is more interest in stuff to do with the northern powerhouse, as evidenced by [Philip] Hammond\u2019s visit [to northern leaders this month],\u201d he said. Lord O\u2019Neill, who resigned from the government last September, spoke as a report published by former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s northern powerhouse thinktank said 850,000 jobs could be created by 2050 with investment from the government and business. The Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP) report, written by business leaders including the Siemens UK chief executive, Juergen Maier, said the government had a \u201cvital role\u201d and urged Hammond, the current chancellor, to use his upcoming budget to commit billions of pounds to close the productivity gap between the north and London. O\u2019Neill, the former Goldman Sachs chief economist who sits on the NPP board, said the projects needed government investment of about \u00a35bn. It was a \u201cbig ask\u201d, he said, but one the government could afford and that fit within its industrial strategy. The report, Powerhouse 2050: the North\u2019s Routemap for Productivity, says the north of England could be \u00a3100bn more productive and be world-leading in four fields \u2013 including energy and digital \u2013 with the right backing. Among the four sectors, it calls for \u00a32bn to replace the entire gas network of Leeds with hydrogen, which would be produced in the Tees Valley, and \u00a31bn to creating a new northern economy of small nuclear reactors. It also calls for \u00a360m for the north to become the UK\u2019s first region commit to industrial digitisation, and \u00a3100m to reinforce the UK as a leader in health data. O\u2019Neill said investment in those four areas would be \u201cgame-changing for the north and of a sufficient magnitude that it would boost the rate of growth of the country as a whole\u201d. In a foreword to the report, Osborne called for the north to bring together its areas of expertise that were currently \u201cin pockets across the region, separated by traditional geographic boundaries with proud local identities\u201d. The former chancellor added: \u201cNational government has an important role too, especially in providing the infrastructure needed \u2013 like northern powerhouse rail, the transformational scheme to connect the great cities of the north. \u201cThere are other investments in science and research and training the government needs to fund, which we cost in this report and which government can clearly afford over the coming years as part of the money it has set aside for its industrial strategy. \u201cBring what the north has committed to deliver and what the government can provide, and you have an economic plan that would raise productivity across the northern economy and could deliver an additional 850,000 jobs.\u201d Last month Osborne suggested May could \u201crelaunch her premiership\u201d at the Conservative party conference this weekend by making a bold commitment to improving transport infrastructure in the north. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, has infuriated mayors, civic and business leaders by scrapping the planned electrification of railway lines in the Midlands and the north. O\u2019Neill described rail electrification as a \u201cred herring\u201d and said it may not be the most cost-effective way forward. The former minister said he had met Grayling last week and was confident the government was committed to improving the north\u2019s transport links. \u201cThe idea that Whitehall isn\u2019t focused on what the north needs for transport, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually very well founded,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key for what\u2019s needed for the north on transport is the straightness of the lines and the number of points. How it\u2019s powered is of much less importance, and that I\u2019m pretty confident about. I know the geeks get all caught up in this stuff but it\u2019s sort of a red herring.\u201d He said he would be \u201camazed if there isn\u2019t some kind of signal intent on transport\u201d in the budget on 22 November, and Hammond\u2019s visit to northern leaders this month was significant. \u201cI\u2019m also hopeful that now [Hill and Timothy] have disappeared the PM seems to be allowing and even almost lightly encouraging more focus on the northern powerhouse,\u201d O\u2019Neill added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
