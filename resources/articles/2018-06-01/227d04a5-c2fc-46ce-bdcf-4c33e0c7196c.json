On 22 June, an anonymous claim was made on Twitter against Keenan, recounting an alleged incident from 2000 when he was part of the band A Perfect Circle, then touring with Nine Inch Nails. The user @IWas17HeWas36 claimed that Keenan led her into a VIP area, invited her on to a tour bus and then raped her. \u201cThere was no consent made,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was not high. I was clean. He did not seduce me, he forced me, quickly taking advantage of my paralyzed state.\u201d He tweeted today that the claim was false. \u201cMany thanks to those of you who saw right through this despicable false claim that only does damage to the #metoo movement,\u201d Keenan tweeted. \u201cAnd shame on those of you who perpetuate this destructive clickbait. As for my delayed but un-required response, I had my phone off. You should try it.\u201d The anonymous account is asking for donations to the anti-sexual-violence organization Rainn as well as putting a call out to other women to send in other alleged stories of assault. The original Twitter thread has received over 2,000 shares. Keenan\u2019s career has also seen him provide vocals for Puscifier, take part in improvisational comedy sketches and act in the film Crank: High Voltage and the show Comedy Bang! Bang! Tool\u2019s most recent album, 10,000 Days, was released in 2007 and sold more than 2.5m copies worldwide. His representatives have been contacted for further comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
