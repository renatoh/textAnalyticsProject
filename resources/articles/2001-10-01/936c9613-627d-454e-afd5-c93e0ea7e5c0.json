The company will issue an announcement at 7am tomorrow, in accordance with stock market regulations. If at least 90% of Tempus shareholders have accepted the 555p per share offer, WPP must go ahead with its acquisition of the company, despite the recent collapse in media share prices. Many of Tempus's biggest shareholders have already agreed to sell and analysts believe acceptances of WPP's offer will be high. Shares in both companies fell today amid the uncertainty, with Tempus now trading at 437.5p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
