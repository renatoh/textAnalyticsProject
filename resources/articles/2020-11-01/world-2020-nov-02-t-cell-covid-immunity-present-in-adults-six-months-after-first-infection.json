The data offers another piece of the puzzle that could be key to understanding whether previous Sars-CoV-2 infections \u2013 the virus behind Covid-19 \u2013 can prevent reinfection, and if so, for how long. The study, led by the UK coronavirus immunology consortium, evaluated 100 non-hospitalised healthcare workers in March and April after antibody responses were detected in them. It is yet to be peer-reviewed. It is the first study to offer data on T-cell levels six months after infection in people with mild or asymptomatic disease that is likely to represent the majority of infections, the authors say. The results of the study are likely to be viewed positively, after previous studies suggested antibody levels can decline within the first few months post-infection. Data released from a 100,000-person sample in August indicated about 6% of the population of England had antibodies \u2013 proteins produced in response to an infection \u2013 but antibody levels dropped by more than a quarter in three months, researchers revealed in late October. Once the virus enters the body, it is greeted by a cavalry of cells that mount a counterattack that is swift, broad and generic. This so-called innate immune system is meant to arrest the infection in its tracks. If that mission is foiled, it buys time until the \u201cexperts\u201d show up. These experts constitute two types of white blood cells: B-cells and T-cells, that work like brothers-in-arms. If the virus makes it past the initial assault, some T-cells are slayers, annihilating respiratory cells the pathogen has colonised. Meanwhile, helper T-cells take on a supportive role \u2013 including stimulating B-cells to produce molecules called antibodies that render the virus immobile or thwart it from penetrating other cells. The adaptive system also retains memory \u2013 but in the case of Covid-19, it is unclear how much and for how long. After being tracked for six months, researchers found that every person had detectable T-cell levels, and levels were 50% higher in people who had experienced symptoms at the time of infection. This could mean that either there will be more protection in people with more severe initial disease, or conversely, that people with asymptomatic disease are able to control the virus with lower levels of T-cells, they said. A bigger set of patients would be tracked for a longer time period to a get a better sense of cellular immunity, given that T-cells could survive for long periods, said one of the study\u2019s authors, Paul Moss, a professor at the University of Birmingham. The authors also saw that T-cells levels were strongly correlated with the peak level of the antibody response. Cellular immune responses could even help to protect against the decline in antibody levels over time, they added. Overall, the results offer evidence that T-cell immunity may last longer than antibodies \u2013 but whether these persistent T-cells offer protection against reinfection remains unclear. \u201cI think this data is reassuring, potentially even encouraging \u2014 but it does not mean that people cannot get reinfected,\u201d Moss said. \u201cWe now need large-scale population studies to show how the antibody and cellular profiles act together to protect people over time.\u201d In the study, some people lost detectable levels of antibodies. But that did not mean that B-cells, which make antibodies, were not around to spring into action if challenged again, the authors explained. Ideally, testing for B-cells and T-cells in the community would provide a conclusive idea of how much the antibody response was actually predicting large-scale immunity, and whether there were people who did not have antibodies but were protected by cellular immunity, cautioned the author Shamez Ladhani, a consultant epidemiologist for Public Health England. \u201cBut at the moment, there is little evidence to suggest that there is widespread cell-mediated immunity without an antibody response.\u201d Paul Morgan, a professor at Cardiff University, who was not involved in the study, said: \u201cThe work provides a welcome dose of optimism that Sars-CoV2 infection (and immunisation?) can induce a robust and sustained protective immune response, although this does not yet prove immunity to further infections which will require longer-term surveillance and larger cohorts.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
