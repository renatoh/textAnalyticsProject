Testifying for almost seven hours at back-to-back hearings on Capitol Hill, Mueller rejected the US president\u2019s claims that his investigation was \u201ca witch-hunt\u201d, that Russian election interference was \u201ca hoax\u201d and that Mueller\u2019s report provided Trump with \u201ctotal exoneration\u201d. Mueller expressed fears that hostile government interference in US elections, and political candidates failing to report it, may become \u201cthe new normal\u201d. Yet for those who had billed the hearings as a made-for-TV-moment that would convey the Mueller report to millions of people unaware of its contents, there was also a sense of anti-climax. It was political theatre without much drama as Mueller stuck rigidly to his published conclusions and provided few new revelations. Worse, he was a star witness lacking star power, often struggling to keep up as questions pinballed from one member of Congress to another and providing only halting answers. At times he seemed uncertain of the contents of his own report. Nevertheless, Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, teased some specific answers out of Mueller likely to grab the attention of TV viewers. \u201cIt is not a witch-hunt,\u201d the special counsel said, refuting one of the president most repeated assertions. Democratic congresswoman Jackie Speier asked: \u201cWould you agree that it was not a hoax that the Russians were engaged in trying to impact our election?\u201d Mueller, who became most animated when warning of the threat of Russia, replied: \u201cAbsolutely. That was not a hoax.\u201d Earlier in the day, at the start of the judiciary committee hearing, its chairman, Jerry Nadler, asked if Mueller\u2019s report exonerated Trump, as the president has frequently claimed. Mueller answered: \u201cNo.\u201d The report did not reach a conclusion on the question of obstruction of justice, he added, and \u201cthe president was not exculpated for the acts that he allegedly committed\u201d. Mueller spent 22 months investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election and Trump campaign ties to Moscow, publishing his redacted report in April. He made clear in a press conference in late May that, if required to testify on Capitol Hill, he would not go beyond the content of his 448-page report. He was as good as his word. A somewhat reluctant witness, Mueller refused to read directly from the report, robbing Democrats of some theatrics. Instead, he often gave monosyllabic responses such as \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d or \u201cCorrect\u201d. There were moments when Democrats led him to a conclusion but, instead of providing clarity, he obfuscated. Mueller\u2019s testimony was not the game changer that some had hoped in the debate over whether to impeach Trump, currently supported by more than 90 House Democrats, including several 2020 presidential candidates. Following his testimony, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told a joint press conference: \u201cMy position has always been whatever decision we make in that regard would have to be made with the strongest possible hand, and we still have some outstanding matters in the courts... This isn\u2019t endless.\u201d Pelosi recalled that in the Watergate scandal, it was the emergence of tapes that \u201cbroke the case\u201d, and said Democrats should go to the people \u201cin the strongest possible way\u201d. Nadler noted upcoming court actions seeking grand jury material and a subpoena against former White House counsel Don McGahn. Nadler expressed satisfaction that the American people had heard directly what Mueller\u2019s investigation uncovered. \u201cAnyone else who acted in this way, if they were not the sitting president, would face criminal prosecution, would face indictments,\u201d he told reporters. He added: \u201cToday was a watershed day in telling the facts to the American people.\u201d Schiff said Mueller\u2019s testimony about the threat from Russia had been powerful. \u201cOne of the most chilling moments in our committee was when he expressed the fear that this becomes the new normal... \u201cEven after the nightmare of the last two and a half years, the president of the US will not foreswear accepting foreign help again... We go into this election more vulnerable than we should be.\u201d Despite having appeared before congressional committees 88 times before, the slow and methodical former FBI director, wearing a suit, white shirt and blue patterned tie, looked ill at ease and sometimes asked for questions to be repeated. If, as some argued, the report was the book and this was the movie adaptation, it was a movie without a leading man. David Axelrod, chief strategist for Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns, tweeted: \u201cThis is delicate to say, but Mueller, whom I deeply respect, has not publicly testified before Congress in at least six years. And he does not appear as sharp as he was then.\u201d Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law at professor at Harvard University, tweeted: \u201cMuch as I hate to say it, this morning\u2019s hearing was a disaster. Far from breathing life into his damning report, the tired Robert Mueller sucked the life out of it.\u201d As the day wore on, Democrats did land some blows, however. Mueller was questioned on why he did not bring criminal charges against the president, who had refused to be interviewed. The congressman Ted Lieu of California asked: \u201cThe reason, again, that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of OLC [Office of Legal Counsel] opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?\u201d Mueller replied: \u201cThat is correct.\u201d Later he sought to clarify his answer: \u201cAs we say in the report, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime.\u201d Even so, his assertion directly contradicts a past claim by Trump\u2019s attorney general, William Barr, who had argued the OLC guidelines played no part in Mueller\u2019s thinking. Mueller also acknowledged that a president could be prosecuted after he left office. The Republican congressman Ken Buck asked: \u201cYou believe that he committed \u2026 you could charge the president of the United States with obstruction of justice after he left office?\u201d Mueller replied: \u201cYes.\u201d In the latest measure of bitter partisanship in Washington, Democrats repeatedly pressed the point that no one is above the law while Republicans attacked Mueller\u2019s credibility and accused his team of political bias. They argued that Mueller\u2019s team was made up of Democrats who had donated to Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton. The Republican Devin Nunes declared: \u201cWelcome, everyone, to the last gasp of the Russian collusion conspiracy theory.\u201d It appears that Trump himself was following the day\u2019s events closely. He tweeted allegations of bias against Mueller, accusing him of seeking revenge after being turned down in his job application for director of the FBI. Mueller stated under oath that he was not, in fact, a candidate for FBI director under Trump. Later, at the White House, Trump told reporters: \u201cWe had a very good day today, the Republican party ... There was no defence of what Robert Mueller was trying to defend ... There was no defence to this ridiculous hoax, this witch-hunt.\u201d He added: \u201cToday proved a lot to everybody.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 26 July 2019 because Ted Lieu is California\u2019s congressman, not Hawaii\u2019s as an earlier version said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
