Allison Neale plays the alto saxophone with a tone so light and airy that it melts at the edges. Her improvised lines unfold in long, looping patterns that make complete sense, yet are never obvious and her choice of material is impeccable. This would be a noteworthy debut in any case, but it is all the more remarkable because it comes from such an unexpected stylistic direction. This kind of gentle, understated playing has been unfashionable for so long that I can't think of another young saxophonist who even attempts it. The rest of the quartet consists of guitarist Dave Cliff, bassist Simon Thorpe and drummer Matt Skelton, the perfect combination for the task. Seasoned jazz buffs will draw comparison with the recordings of Paul Desmond and Jim Hall, but you don't need to have heard them to appreciate this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
