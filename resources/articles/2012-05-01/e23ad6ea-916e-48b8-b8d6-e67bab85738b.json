Barry, who suffered the injury during a 26-minute cameo appearance as a substitute in Norway on Saturday, underwent a scan on Monday which confirmed his worst fears. The Manchester City midfielder had travelled to the World Cup two years ago still recovering from ankle damage and struggled to impose himself on the finals, with the timing of his latest setback having ruled out a repeat of that scenario. The tear, which he felt upon his introduction in Oslo, will take up to four weeks to heal with the player left devastated by the timing of the injury. The England manager, Roy Hodgson, had always indicated he would not risk taking a player struggling for fitness to Poland and Ukraine, particularly with Wayne Rooney already suspended for the first two group games, ensuring Barry is now left to concentrate on rehabilitation with his club. \"I'm very disappointed to lose Gareth,\" said Hodgson. \"Not only was he a member of my original 23-man squad but he has featured prominently in the England team over the last few years. I know how much he wanted to be part of the tournament but I'm sure he will still have a part to play with England after the Euros. I wish him a speedy recovery.\" Both Glen Johnson (infected toe) and Daniel Welbeck (ankle) will be named in the final squad to be submitted to Uefa by 11am on Tuesday morning, along with Scott Parker who had been hampered by an achilles injury over the final weeks of the domestic season, with Jagielka now included among those who will reconvene at their Hertfordshire hotel this lunchtime. The Everton centre-half, who has operated at right-back at times, impressed while earning his 11th capin the 1-0 win in Oslo on Saturday and, having also been a key performer in the friendly defeat of Spain last November, had arguably been the surprise omission from the original party. His elevation from the standby list, rather than Liverpool's Jordan Henderson, will see Phil Jones act as cover both at right-back and in central midfield with Jagielka an option at centre-half. \"I am really pleased for Jags,\" said the Everton manager, David Moyes. \"I said earlier that I was disappointed he was only on the stand-by list, because I thought he'd bring something different to the rest of the defenders. \"I think the way he performed last season \u2013 certainly in the second half of it \u2013 merited a call-up to the original squad, so I'm delighted he's in there at last. In my opinion, when I look at some of England's best performances, they've all come when Jags has been involved in them. He most certainly deserves to be in and around international company and it's great for him that he can now look forward to the Euros.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
