Or it could be one of two Spanish sides: Real Madrid or Sevilla or even the French team, Bordeaux.\" Inter were joined by Barcelona, the Group F winners who had the result of the evening with a 2-1 win at Dynamo Kyiv. \"It was an important game,\" said the Bar\u00e7a coach, Pep Guardiola. \"It was important to win the group and we were playing with that in mind. It was physically tough, but it's going to get even tougher from here.\" Kick off at the Lobanovskiy Stadium was 9.45pm local time to synchronise with events at San Siro and with the temperature just below freezing, Kyiv took the lead after two minutes as Artem Milevsky's header squeezed under Victor Vald\u00e9s. The game was played on a surface which was the subject of representations from the Barcelona backroom staff before kick-off, although their complaints were waved away. Forced to get on with it, Xavi equalised before half-time and with four minutes to go Lionel Messi eliminated any jitters with a well-struck, curling free kick. At San Siro, Samuel Eto'o got things moving for Mourinho's side, his first goal in the competition since opening the scoring for Bar\u00e7a in last year's final against Manchester United, and Mario Balotelli got Inter's second with a devastating free kick after 64 minutes. Balotelli was very much the man of the moment, back-heeling the ball into the Cameroon striker's path for the opener and drilling in a 35-yard free kick that gave the goalkeeper no chance. Standard Li\u00e8ge's Sinan Bolat followed Bayern Munich's Hans-Jorg Butt to become the second goalkeeper in as many days to score in the Champions League, Bolat's injury-time header snatching a 1\u20111 draw against AZ Alkmaar in Group H to earn his club a Europa League place. Jeremain Lens had grabbed the lead for AZ in the 42nd minute, when he latched on to a cross from S\u00e9bastien Pocognoli to side-foot the ball into the bottom corner, but the keeper's goal ensured they finished on four points, one behind Li\u00e8ge. \"We ran, we struggled and in the end we got an historic goal. It's good for the history of football, I think,\" said the coach, Laszlo Boloni. In Group G, three goals in the first 11 minutes helped Stuttgart beat Unirea Urziceni 3-1 and lift the Romanian champions into the knockout phase. With the former Spurs manager Christian Gross in their dugout for the first time, the German side took the lead after five minutes, when Ciprian Marica headed in. Christian Traesch and Pavel Pogrebnyak killed the game off. Stuttgart join Sevilla in the knockout round. The draw for the next rounds of both competitions will take place in Nyon, Switzerland, on 18 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
