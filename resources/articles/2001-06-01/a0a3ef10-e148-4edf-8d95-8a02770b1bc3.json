Former Tory trade minister Hamilton was declared bankrupt on a petition brought by Mohamed al-Fayed to recoup his costs following Hamilton's unsuccessful libel action against the Harrods boss. He intends taking his case to the European Court of Human Rights. But the White Paper, Opportunity For All In A World Of Change could be a better bet. Launched in February, one of its aims is to reform the insolvency law in England and Wales and sweep away 'many of the outdated and unnecessary restrictions' that apply to all bankrupts - regardless of culpability - such as those preventing them from being a Member of Parliament, a school governor, a trustee of a charity, or a local councillor. The Government is also committed to cutting from three years to one the maximum default period during which people served bankruptcy orders are subject to other restrictions, such as being barred from directorships without court permission. Most bankrupts will be discharged much earlier than one year, however. On the other hand, those bankrupts whose failure is deemed to be 'irresponsible, negligent or dishonest' could be subject to restrictions for up to 15 years. Judi James, author and business consultant, has some advice for Hamilton should he need a job to help pay off his debts. 'There is no legal requirement to declare that you are a bankrupt when applying for a job but unfortunately in Hamilton's case all the publicity he has received means that it will probably be already known, so working on contacts is his safest bet to find work. Should he get to the interview stage, he shouldn't go along looking too prosperous. I would advise a Next suit rather than Savile Row.' However, while the Government's reforming fervour may help Hamilton, its main concern is to nurture entrepreneurs by looking more to the bankruptcy rules in the US than the rest of Europe. There were 14,317 company insolvencies last year, and the Government is concerned that if people whose businesses fail are left with no assets, they will not try to start another business. At the same time, Labour is trying to balance its desire not to stifle entrepreneurship with its other desire to protect employees and consumers from rogue directors. Companies House, which maintains a register of directors who have been disqualified by the courts, has created a website (www.companieshouse.gov.uk) to provide the public with instant access to the register of disqualified directors. It also runs a 24-hour telephone hotline for people to report banned directors involved in running companies. Yet although fraud is only present in a small percentage of bankruptcies, both corporate and individual, bankrupts still have to contend with the stigma that can jeopardise their careers and their chances of getting work. Someone who has for many years run a business that has failed through no fault of their own can find themselves tarred with the same brush as someone who has become addicted to shopping and run up huge credit card debt. And for certain professionals, such as solicitors, being made bankrupt can also mean not being able to continue practising during the course of the bankruptcy. But other professions have had to face the reality of growing personal debt - the average debt per head of population is \u00a310,000 - and take a softer line, rather than lose otherwise valued employees. Mike Thomas is a consultant for insolvency practitioners Jeffreys Henry Jacobs. An ex-police officer, he specialises in dealing with debt problems of serving officers, which is a huge problem, he says. The average debt he deals with is \u00a340,000 - and it is not usually the result of high living, he says. 'It can happen so easily. Police officers in London get free travel, but if someone is, for instance, moved to another police station for which they will need a car, that can easily up their outgoings by \u00a3250 a month. 'The problem is there is too much credit around. I have one Met officer on my books who owes \u00a327,000. His repayments are \u00a31,100, he has lost his overtime so he is netting \u00a31,700 instead of \u00a32,500, so now he is \u00a31,800 a month down. Debt spirals out of control so easily.' According to the Association of Chief Police Officers, police officers who are made bankrupt should not continue serving 'although this is not an absolute hard and fast rule'. But Thomas says: 'The majority of chief constables look at the circumstances surrounding the debts before deciding on an officer's future. If it was a matter of fast cars and exotic holidays that would be one thing, but often it is down to divorce or illness, circumstances beyond their control. 'If the officer tried to seek help, tried to avoid bankruptcy and told their superiors what was going on, then they would not necessarily lose their job. Why dismiss an officer who may have cost up to \u00a370,000 to train over the years? 'Instead, often what will happen is that they will be investigated by internal affairs, credit reference agencies will be checked and, if the chief constable is happy, they will be allowed to continue working. It is not necessarily all doom and gloom.' John McQueen, founder and chief executive of the Bankruptcy Association (helpline: 01524 64305), supports the Government's move to soften the bankruptcy laws but would like to see it go further in following the US model. 'It was pleasing for me to read in the consultation document that the Insolvency Service now, at last, accepts that the vast majority of bankrupt people are decent, honest folk.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
