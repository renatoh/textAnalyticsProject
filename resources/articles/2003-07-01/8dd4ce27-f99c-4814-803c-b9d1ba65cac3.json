We have used the absolute experts in their field in the most objective and transparent fashion,\" said Matt Rapp of the ATP. Wada, through its chairman Dick Pound, yesterday wrote to the ATP offering an independent overview after seven players, six of them unidentified, had tested positive for traces of nandrolone between August last year and this May. The ATP announced on Wednesday that an electrolyte replacement product routinely given to players by Tour trainers might have been contaminated, and admitted that the ATP, not the players, was culpable. \"This only indicates a theory and it is inconclusive,\" said David Howman of Wada. \"It could be that the decision reached was very fair and proper, but as far as we know this is the first time an anti-doping tribunal has overturned a previous decision. The weight of evidence must have been considerable, and we have not had that evidence.\" The ATP does not have to respond to Wada's offer. However, with the outside possibility of systematic doping not having been entirely ruled out, it would be seen by the outside world as disingenuous if it failed to take up the offer of the Montreal-based independent drugs watchdog. It is also possible that ATP players might be prevented from playing in the Olympic Games and Davis Cup. \"We had put out warning after warning about these supplements and we recognise it as a very large but honest mistake,\" said Rapp. He acknowledged that the WTA, the women's governing body, had stopped dispensing such supplements more than a year ago after warnings from the International Tennis Federation and International Olympic Committee. \"They beat us to the punch.\" \"We went to the anti-doping tribunal once it became apparent that a series of tests in a Montreal laboratory had shown a number of identical results, and it was their decision,\" said Rapp. \"The burden of proof is normally with the player, but we could not say for certain that it was not us. One player said that the only supplements he had taken had been given to him by an ATP trainer.\" The Czech player Bohdan Ulihrach may now sue the cash-strapped ATP for lost income after being cleared of doping charges that kept him out of the game for the last nine months. The 28-year-old tested positive for nandrolone in October last year and in May was banned for two years, fined $43,770 and docked 100 ranking points. \"The words we have used throughout this process have been 'disturbing' and 'disappointing'\", said Howman. \"And our analysis of it leads us to ask what evidence was given to the tribunal and how rigorously was it tested. The ATP have come up with one theory, but it is not the only one.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
