Less than a year before the president faces re-election, the House of Representatives began public hearings on Wednesday into allegations that Trump abused the power of his office. As Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair, gaveled the House intelligence committee into session, cameras from every major network carried the proceedings to millions of Americans, some of whom were encountering the allegations against Trump for the first time. In an opening statement, Schiff said the hearings would explore whether Trump sought to exploit Ukraine\u2019s vulnerability, condition White House acts on Ukraine\u2019s willingness to help his re-election, and \u201cwhether such an abuse of his power is compatible with the presidency\u201d. Schiff said: \u201cThe matter is as simple and as terrible as that. Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency but the future of the presidency itself.\u201d Trump filled his Twitter account on Wednesday morning with video clips of his defenders attacking the proceedings. But in the hearing room, new testimony tied Trump directly to a plot to condition US military aid and a White House visit on a Ukrainian announcement of the Biden investigation. Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, a state department deputy assistant secretary, were the first witnesses to be called. Taylor said one of his aides had heard Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, talking to Trump on the phone in July. Taylor said: \u201cFollowing the phone call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which [Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy] Giuliani was pressing for.\u201d The opening of the public impeachment hearings was a day Trump has struggled furiously to prevent, blocking witnesses, attacking investigators and throwing up a social media smokescreen. Trump has claimed his push for investigations in Ukraine arose from his concern about corruption in the country. \u201cI\u2019m too busy to watch it,\u201d Trump told reporters about the hearings. \u201cIt\u2019s a witch-hunt, it\u2019s a hoax.\u201d The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, tweeted that the hearings were \u201cboring\u201d. Devin Nunes, the senior Republican on the committee, declared the proceedings a \u201clow-rent Ukrainian sequel\u201d to the Russia investigation and said \u201cit\u2019s nothing more than an impeachment process in search of a crime.\u201d Republicans sought to blunt the impact of the testimony by pointing out that the witnesses had not had direct conversations with Trump about his intentions. They also argued that in asking for investigations, Trump was pursuing a legitimate anti-corruption agenda in Ukraine. Democrats responded that Trump has not expressed any anti-corruption initiative not having to do with Biden. Taylor said: \u201cI am not here to take one side or the other, or to advocate for any particular outcome of these proceedings. My purpose is to provide the facts as I know them.\u201d Taylor described his concern to discover, last spring, an informal policy channel in Ukraine led by Giuliani, and advanced by US officials close to the White House, including Sondland. Sondland told Taylor that he had told the Ukrainians that \u201ceverything\u201d \u2013 military aid and a White House meeting for Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2013 depended on Zelenskiy\u2019s willingness to announce an investigation of Biden, Trump\u2019s political rival, Taylor testified. With a half-century of foreign service experience between them, the witnesses described a US policy of supporting Ukraine as a frontline state against what they said was a Russian assault on the \u201crules-based order\u201d in eastern Europe. For the newly elected Zelenskiy, Kent testified, a White House meeting would be crucial. \u201cA meeting with the US president in the Oval Office at the White House\u201d would be seen, said Kent, \u201cas the ultimate sign of endorsement and support from the United States\u201d. The US demand that Ukraine pursue politically motivated investigations, and the withholding of aid for Ukraine, undermined US efforts to promote the rule of law and threatened to give Russia a free hand in the region, the diplomats testified. Taylor was asked what he meant when he said in a text message obtained by the committee that withholding security assistance for Ukraine to help a political campaign was \u201ccrazy\u201d. \u201cTo withhold that assistance for no good reason other than to help with a political campaign made no sense,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt was counterproductive. It was illogical, it could not be explained, it was crazy.\u201d The White House and its allies sought to dismiss the hearing as dull and irrelevant. Press secretary Stephanie Grisham and Trump\u2019s son, Eric, both dismissed it as \u201cboring\u201d, with Eric adding \u201c#Snoozefest\u201d in a tweet. The president himself seemed to have found the historic day soporific, judging by his low-energy, croaky-voiced performance at a joint press conference at the White House with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan which started an hour late. \u201cAre you talking about the witch hunt?\u201d Trump asked a reporter. \u201cIs that what you mean? Is that what you\u2019re talking about? I hear it\u2019s a joke. I haven\u2019t watched, I haven\u2019t watched for one minute because I\u2019ve been with the president, which is much more important as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d Corey Brettschneider, the author of The Oath and the Office: A Guide to the Constitution for Future Presidents and a professor of constitutional law at Brown University, said that the president\u2019s powers do not include exercising foreign policy for his own personal benefit. \u201cThe framers dedicated a significant amount of time to thinking about this,\u201d Brettschneider said. \u201cThey made a deliberate decision to say \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors\u2019, emphasizing that if the president abused power \u2013 not just committed a crime \u2013 then he or she would be removed.\u201d\ufeff"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
