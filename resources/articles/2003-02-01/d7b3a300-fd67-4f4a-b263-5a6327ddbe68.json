The Italians have been struck by a flu virus that has swept through the club and forced Lippi to fill up his squad with raw youngsters. The Italian champions left a quintet of key players in Turin nursing high temperatures and cancelled yesterday's training session at Old Trafford with flu sweeping through the squad. That is likely to forceLippi to field only four of the permitted seven substitutes tonight, including the youth team goalkeeper Landry Bonnefoi who, at 19, has yet to play for the senior side. Lippi himself has a bout of the sniffles having also contracted the virus that forced him to leave Gianluigi Buffon, Alessandro Birindelli, Gianluca Zambrotta, Marco Di Vaio and Marcelo Salas in Italy. Added to that sick list are the pivotal Alessandro Del Piero, out with a thigh injury, the Croat Igor Tudor (ankle) and Mark Iuliano and Ruben Olivera, who have also gone down with fevers. While Lippi remains confident that he will be able to field a side with six players definitely out, any more cry-offs would result in a request for a postponement. But he said: \"I'm not contemplating the game being called off at the moment.\" \"I'm going to have to wait and see how things develop overnight and whether three or four more of my players develop flu symptoms.\" Not that Sir Alex Ferguson was publicly encouraged by his opponents' headaches. \"There's always a worry that, when you play a weakened team, you drop your own physical and mental preparations,\" he said. \"We cannot afford to fall into that trap. Manchester United against Juventus is the biggest club game in the world. It doesn't matter who has flu, we are still playing the name and we have to do our job.\" \"I always remember playing Borussia Dortmund in the semi-final here when they were apparently 'all dying'. But they flew in J\u00fcrgen Kohler at midnight the night before the game, he played and they won. We are all selfish, so it should be good news that they have a few players out, but I would actually prefer them to have their strongest side available.\" The losses may prompt the Juve manager into an ultra-cautious approach this evening, leaving David Trezeguet alone up front, though his walking wounded did enough in winning 2-1 at a freezing Parma on Sunday to establish themselves alongside Internazionale at the top of Serie A. They also apparently impressed the watching Ferguson, whose side will be without the suspended Juan Sebastian Veron and Laurent Blanc, missing through injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
