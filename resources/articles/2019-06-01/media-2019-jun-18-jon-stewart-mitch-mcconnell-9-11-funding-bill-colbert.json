But entertainer and activist Jon Stewart targeted the Kentucky senator in a late-night diatribe delivered on Monday on the Late Show, the variety program hosted by former Stewart protege Stephen Colbert. Periscoping from beneath Colbert\u2019s desk at the start of the program, Stewart escalated a tangle with McConnell that began last week, when Stewart blasted members of Congress for failing to attend a hearing about renewing funding for the 9/11 victims compensation fund. Stewart was needlessly \u201cbent out of shape\u201d about members missing the hearing, McConnell replied in a Fox News appearance on Monday morning. \u201cThat frequently happens because members have a lot of things going on at the same time,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnd it sounds to me like he\u2019s looking for some way to take offense.\u201d Stewart seized on McConnell\u2019s comments in his appearance on Colbert\u2019s program. \u201cYou know what, Stephen, I feel so stupid,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThis is a huge misunderstanding. I didn\u2019t know that they were busy. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt them with their JOBS! Stewart continued: Honestly Mitch McConnell, you really want to go with the \u2018We\u2019ll get to it when we get to it\u2019 argument for the heroes of 9/11? Listen senator, I know that your species isn\u2019t known for moving quickly \u2026 But damn, senator, you\u2019re not good at this argument thing. Basically we\u2019re saying you love the 9/11 community when they serve your political purposes, but when they\u2019re in urgent need, you slow walk, you dither \u2013 you use it as a political pawn to get other things you want \u2013 and you don\u2019t get the job done completely. And your answer to that charge is, \u2018Yeah, duh, we\u2019re Congress, that\u2019s how we do\u2019.\u201d As an activist, Stewart has become the public face of the fight to renew the 9/11 victims\u2019 fund, which is set to expire next year. In his Fox News appearance, McConnell said Stewart didn\u2019t need to worry about it. \u201cWe have never failed to address this issue and we will address it again,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s all bent out of shape.\u201d The exchange afforded a case study of the six-term senator\u2019s favored tactic for political knife-fights. The tactic is to exude the profound comfort of untouchable power \u2013 even his critics admit McConnell is convincing at it \u2013 and then to express confusion about why his opponents are so worked up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
