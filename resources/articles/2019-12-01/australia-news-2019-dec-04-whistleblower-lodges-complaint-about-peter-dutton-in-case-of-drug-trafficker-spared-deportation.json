William Sualauvi Betham was convicted of involvement in a drug trafficking syndicate and sentenced to 10 years\u2019 jail by the Queensland supreme court, something that would ordinarily trigger an automatic visa cancellation. But Betham was spared deportation and allowed to live in Australia after the visa cancellation was revoked. The case has prompted investigations by the home affairs department and the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity following claims that Betham had boasted to a fellow detainee that he could get his visa back in exchange for financial payments. Dutton has previously said Betham\u2019s visa matter did not \u201ccome to my office for consideration\u201d. But the whistleblower\u2019s complaint to the commonwealth ombudsman states that Dutton\u2019s department prepared a ministerial briefing on the case \u2013 a claim confirmed by documents seen by Guardian Australia. The whistleblower said he believed Dutton\u2019s statement was \u201cpatently false\u201d, but acknowledged he did not know if the brief was actually provided to the minister\u2019s office. Ministerial briefings on potentially controversial matters are routinely sent to ministers\u2019 offices across all portfolios. The whistleblower said in his complaint: \u201cI have no reason to believe that the department withheld the brief from the minister\u2019s office despite being prepared.\u201d Earlier this year, the home affairs department said it had already investigated the Betham case and found the visa decision \u201cwas not provided to the minister or his office for consideration or decision\u201d. The department said in response to a question on notice in Senate estimates hearings in March: \u201cThe Betham visa decision was determined by an officer of the department, pursuant to their delegated authority. \u201cThe department has assessed the allegation of corruption and in accordance with the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006, the matter was referred to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI).\u201d The department reiterated that answer when approached by Guardian Australia this week, saying the case never came before the minister for consideration. A department spokesman said the Betham decision was made by \u201ca departmental delegate of the minister\u201d. \u201cDecisions under section 501 to cancel, refuse or revoke a mandatory cancellation may be made by the minister or a delegated departmental decision-maker,\u201d the department said. \u201cWhen a decision is made to cancel or refuse a visa under section 501, or not to revoke a mandatory cancellation, all relevant information and circumstances, including the impact on the individual and the individual\u2019s family, are taken into account. \u201cThe department works closely with our integrity and law enforcement partners to investigate allegations of misconduct and corruption.\u201d Parliament has previously heard that the home affairs department and Aclei were investigating claims that Betham boasted to a fellow detainee that he could get his visa back in exchange for financial payments. Betham, through his lawyer Jennifer Samuta, has previously denied any suggestion he \u201coffered a monetary payment to any official who might be in a position to reinstate his visa, or to an official who might be able to impact a similar decision\u201d. He also denied bragging to fellow detainees at Christmas Island that he could \u201cget his visa back for a monetary payment after it was mandatorily cancelled\u201d. Dutton has attacked the veracity of the witness who said he overheard Betham\u2019s comment, saying he was a convicted criminal with no credibility. Samuta told the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald that the department returned Betham\u2019s visa following her arguments that he had been rehabilitated and was at low risk of reoffending. In March, the home affairs department secretary, Michael Pezzullo, said the matter was under investigation but there was nothing to suggest the alleged corrupt conduct had occurred. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing before me to suggest that any wrongdoing has occurred,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, there is a serious, particularised, quite specific allegation. It could be someone just talking through their hat, but, equally, there could be something more sinister at play. \u201cThere is a serious allegation that\u2019s been made public through social media and its promulgation through social media. It would be irresponsible of me and, of course, it would be an unacceptable failure by me in doing my duties under the law not to examine that matter.\u201d The home affairs department did not respond to a request for comment. The minister\u2019s office referred the Guardian to the department\u2019s previous responses to questions on notice. The commonwealth ombudsman said it could not comment on whether it had received a whistleblower complaint, but noted disclosures about \u201cthe conduct of members of parliament is not covered\u201d by Australia\u2019s whistleblower laws. Aclei would not comment on whether it was still investigating allegations connected to the Betham case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
