What is remarkable is that they come from all over: not just MPs (nor just Labour MPs), but the government's own number-crunchers and even \u2013 irony of ironies \u2013 the very credit ratings agencies that were, according to the chancellor's earlier claims, baying for big cuts. Let us begin with the number-crunchers. Forget for a moment about the cuts that Mr Osborne has planned \u2013 and consider instead the austerity measures set in train by Alistair Darling when he was still in No 11. The National Audit Office has, and yesterday it reported that Whitehall is already struggling to make the \u00a335bn of cuts targeted by Labour. Not only would the civil service fail to make those savings by the deadline of 2011, said the NAO, but many of the cuts actually in the bag were not sustainable. By all means take the coalition line and argue that Labour was always half-hearted when it came to public scrimping rather than public spending. There is some truth to that. But the cuts that Mr Darling wanted were mere loose change compared with those planned by his Tory successor. The Value for Money savings were \u00a335bn; the programme laid out in June's emergency budget included \u00a399bn of spending cuts by 2015. And yes, that really is per year. The message of the NAO report for Mr Osborne is: it ain't gonna happen \u2013 no way, no how. That is just the practical objection. Then there are the economics, laid out in admirably clear fashion by the Treasury select committee. In its report yesterday the cross-party group of MPs warns that Mr Osborne's slash-and-burn programme raises the risk that the UK will slide back into recession. It also warns that \"the chancellor may need to alter his current plans to compensate for external events\". In other words: get yourself a plan B, Mr Osborne. Yet when the new man at No 11 was asked last week by the Treasury select committee what his back-up plan actually was, he replied: \"The plan is to have confidence in the British economy.\" Crossing one's fingers is not a plausible strategy for the man running the British economy. Perhaps the government is preparing for another round of quantitative easing, or pumping money into financial markets, even though there is little convincing evidence that the last round did anything more than hand money to banks to funnel into speculation and bonuses. Or perhaps the government thinks the private sector really is going to ride to the rescue. These are big gambles: if they flop, it will be voters who lose out before Mr Osborne does."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
