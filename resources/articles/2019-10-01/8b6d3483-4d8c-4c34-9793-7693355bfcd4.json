Jones has described the All Blacks as the greatest team in sport but has called on his players to \u201cchange history\u201d in the World Cup semi-final on Saturday. Jones on Thursday confirmed his decision to recall George Ford for England\u2019s first World Cup semi-final for 12 years and reiterated his belief that no one outside the camp believes they are capable of beating New Zealand, who have not lost a match at the tournament since 2007 and are bidding for an unprecedented third consecutive title. The All Blacks are also ranked No 1 in the world \u2013 a position they held for 10 consecutive years until Wales and Ireland enjoyed spells at the top shortly before the start of the competition. England, on the other hand, have not occupied top spot for 15 years and have not beaten the All Blacks since 2012. Last year they lost their only match against New Zealand under Jones, going down by a point. Jones, however, believes England can establish themselves as the world\u2019s best. Before the World Cup started he invited Sir Alex Ferguson to address his squad and in echoes of the former Manchester United manager\u2019s claim that usurping rivals Liverpool was his greatest achievement, he said: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been involved in rugby the country you want to knock off is New Zealand, because they\u2019ve been the best. And the reason you\u2019re involved in this game is you want to be the best. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the opportunity to change rugby history. We\u2019re not the best in the world, but we\u2019ve got an opportunity on Saturday to go a step further. I don\u2019t think [rugby] needs it but I think we need it.\u201d After Jones had claimed earlier this week that his side had been spied on in training and that pressure was chasing New Zealand \u201cdown the street\u201d, the All Blacks head coach, Steve Hansen, returned fire by reminding England of their failure to get out of their pool at their own World Cup four years ago. But Jones, who beat the All Blacks five times in 11 matches when in charge of Australia, countered: \u201cWe are ready for the game, we\u2019ve had two-and-a-half years to prepare for this game. [Thirteen] of our players were involved on the [2017] Lions tour. Every game they play at the Six Nations the other country is coming for them. \u201cThis is a big game, let\u2019s not doubt that, but our players have had big-match experience. They\u2019ve failed, they\u2019ve had success and that\u2019s one of the big things I like about this team. We\u2019ve had to learn from those wins, those losses and Saturday it\u2019ll be tested again. We want to write the script, we don\u2019t want to be watching it, we\u2019ve got to be in there writing it.\u201d Jones expects England supporters to be outnumbered at the 72,000\u2011seat Yokohama Stadium, in the main because despite his close links with Japan he believes the locals have adopted the All Blacks as their second team. He urged those in attendance to show their support, however. \u201cWe saw that in the football World Cup and in the cricket World Cup and we are feeling it in the rugby World Cup. \u201cOur supporters have got a big job for us. We need them to be at their most vocal. They need to drink a fair bit of beer beforehand and be ready to go. Most people think New Zealand are going to win, that\u2019s the reality. We\u2019ve got 31 players and 20-odd staff who believe we can win, we\u2019re the only people in Japan who think we can win.\u201d Ford\u2019s recall is the only change made by Jones, with Courtney Lawes keeping his place in the second row. George Kruis had emerged as a candidate to start given his lineout expertise and the fact that was an area England struggled with in the second half of their defeat by New Zealand last year. \u201cThe most crucial stage of this game is going to be the second 20 minutes of the second half, where the game\u2019s going to be won or lost,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWe\u2019ve been particularly been more diligent in selecting our team to take that into consideration. In fact we selected our finishing team first.\u201d Meanwhile, Jones refused to be drawn on speculation linking him with the vacant Australia job after the World Cup, following the departure of Michael Cheika as head coach. Jones is contracted to the Rugby Football Union until 2021 but has a break clause which can be activated after the tournament. Asked about the Wallabies vacancy, he said: \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m thinking of is the game on Saturday, that\u2019s not coming into my mindset at the moment. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really a question for today.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
