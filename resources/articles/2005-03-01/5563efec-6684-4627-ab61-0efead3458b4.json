Blimey, this is a terrible line, you're not in an underground toilet by any chance, are you? Nah, I'm in Hereford. Just finished racing. How modest of you not to mention that you've just notched up another two victories and are surely a cert to be Champion Jockey for the eighth consecutive season ... Yeah, I won the first two, which was of course satisfying, but I only came second in the last race. Not at all pleased about that. Still, who cares, eh? At this time of year the only thing that matters is Cheltenham, right? No, I take every race as it comes and I want to win every one. Winning is better than losing. I am, of course, looking forward to Cheltenham. It's fair to say it's my favourite festival and hopefully I'll be able to pick up a few winners. Has the virus that swept through Jonjo O'Neill's stable over the winter hampered your chances? It obviously wasn't ideal [trails off...] Quite. So how's Therealbandit looking, that's who you're riding in the Gold Cup, isn't it? Maybe. It hasn't been decided yet. Any tips? [Grotesque gurgling sound ... for a second Small Talk assumes a nearby horse is trying to give the tip straight from its mouth. Turns out its just more interference on the line] Nah. You've got more records to your name than Bruce 'The Boss' Springsteen. What is there left for you to aspire to? I think I've achieved most of what can be done in my sport so the challenge now is to maintain it, not to rest on my laurels. If you weren't a jockey, what would you like to have been? Maybe a footballer or a golfer. I like formula one as well. Basically, if you're privileged enough to make a living out of playing sport then you've got a great job. You're reputed to be a fine golfer. What's your handicap? [Dismissively] Ah, I just play for enjoyment. I don't take it as seriously as I should. You're a big Arsenal fan too, or is that just a nasty rumour? [Perks up] It's true! Commiserations and all that. What do you make of the view that Thierry Henry's just a flat-track bully? Nah, I don't buy that. He's been voted second-best player in the world for each of the last two seasons and he wouldn't get recognition like that if he didn't do it in the big games. What's the last CD you bought? [Pained pause as he seems to debate whether the question is interesting enough to merit an answer] I think it was Franz Ferdinand. Or maybe Snow Patrol. So when you're not legs akimbo on some nag's rump, you're to be found in a dimly lit nightspot checking out the latest foppish shoe-gazers? Actually, I've never been to a concert in my life. Although that could change this summer as I'm hoping to go see U2. Their gig in Croke Park [Dublin] should be something special. Favourite TV show? Like I said, sport's my thing. If I'm not watching some live event, then Sky Sports News is on almost permanently in my house. Sounds like Small Talk's office - fancy a job? The pay's awful but you sometimes get to chat to top jockeys ... [Almost laughs] Always over a crappy phone line? Yes. Well, then you can [wild crackling drowns out end of sentence] You must have at least watched John McCririck in Big Brother? [Chuckles] I meant to have a look but I honestly never got round to it. What's your favourite drink? I don't drink. Water's worth a try. [Desolate silence] Erm. Your favourite food? I have to be very careful about what I eat; I'm quite tall for what I do and I put on weight very easily. So you never pig out? Nah. What would you put in Room 101? What's that? [Small Talk offers concise definition] Fuckin' hell, how many things do you want!? [Hearing this exclamation, some bloke in the background inquires, \"what did he ask you?\", to which the real McCoy replies, \"he wants to know if there's anything that annoys me!\" - both men dissolve into several seconds of uncontrollable laughter. Then the champion jockey pulls himself together and states, matter-of-factly] Happy people. The world. [Trying to sound agreeably glum] Is that just you trying to portray yourself as a sulky superstar? Nah, I'm serious. Coming second is another thing that really annoys me. But there's so many other things too ... Right, um, tell us a joke. [Chaotic crackling. Then line seems to go dead. Suddenly it returns] I'm off home now so just got time for one more question. [Feeling under pressure, Small Talk blurts out the first question that crosses its mind, which for some reason is...] What's the capital of Burundi? [The lonely sound of nothingness] Sorry, just a bad gag: know any good ones? [more interference on the line] Didn't catch that. Tell you what, let's wind it up there. Thanks for chatting and good luck at Cheltenham. Thanks Small Talk. Bye."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
