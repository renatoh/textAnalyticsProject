Excess production capacity around the world has put manufacturers under pressure, particularly in the mature markets in western Europe, the trade and industry select committee warns in a report published today. Last year the UK car industry was hit by the closure of the PSA Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn plant at Ryton, near Coventry, with the loss of some 2,000 jobs, while Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire announced 900 job losses. The 2006 round of cuts followed the closure of MG Rover in 2005, which cost more than 6,000 jobs. In its report on the success and failure of the UK automotive industry the committee acknowledged many of the companies in the sector were flourishing. It cited new models, increased engine-making capacity and R&amp;D investment, but noted there were still causes for concern. \"The job losses at Ryton and Ellesmere Port had many causes. The fundamental one, for volume car producers, is the excess production capacity in areas of the world, including western Europe, where demand is stagnant or falling,\" said the committee's chairman, Peter Luff. \"This does not mean that the UK automotive industry is doomed; but it does indicate that individual plants which are old fashioned and inflexible, are simple assembly plants, are remote from the company's supply chain, produce only one model and have productivity or skills problems will be vulnerable.\" \"So, despite so much good news, no one can rule out further large-scale job losses in the UK automotive industry in future. It is therefore all the more important that lessons are learned from the experiences of dealing with the mass redundancies arising from the collapse of MG Rover.\" The Ellesmere Port plant is facing competition from other General Motors facilities in Europe to build the next generation Astra, while Ford's decision to build the new Land Rover Freelander alongside Jaguars at Halewood, Merseyside, rather than at the main Land Rover plant at Solihull has raised some eyebrows in the industry. Mr Luff said the committee was not aware of an imminent threat to any UK plant. \"We are not hiding some new, dark, secret but it would be foolish to deny the possibility [of further job losses].\" He pointed out that while there was evidence of investment in the sector, much of it related to one company, Ford. Last July Ford, which produces engines at Dagenham and Bridgend, pledged to spend at least \u00a31bn on developing \"greener technologies\" in the UK for its Ford, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands. The committee said it was disturbed that Ford alone accounted for 80% of R&amp;D investment. It called on the government to review whether the UK was still at the forefront of innovation in the industry. It also wanted it to investigate manufacturers' claims that labour costs in the UK were higher than in France despite the latter's \"notorious social costs\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
