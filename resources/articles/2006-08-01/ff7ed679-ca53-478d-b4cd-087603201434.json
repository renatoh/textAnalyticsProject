The club vice-chairman David Dein confirmed yesterday the offer for the 22-year-old forward had been turned down by and suggested Reyes may stay at the Emirates Stadium this season. \"They have made an offer which has been rejected,\" Dein told Sky Sports News. \"He is an Arsenal player and may very well remain an Arsenal player.\" Atl\u00e9tico's president Enrique Cerezo had earlier confirmed their interest in Reyes. He said Atl\u00e9tico had lodged \"an important offer\" for Reyes and denied his club would have to offload any players to finance the deal. Reports in Spain said Atl\u00e9tico offered in the region of \u00a38.1m. Arsenal were reported to have placed a \u00a312.2m price tag on the Spain international. Real Madrid were seen as the favourites to land the former Sevilla player but their city rivals had stepped up their efforts to take him to the Vicente Calder\u00f3n Stadium instead. Chelsea's manager Jose Mourinho insists it will not be a problem if they fail to sign Ashley Cole from Arsenal. Talks between the clubs have reached an impasse with neither wishing to lose face over any deal. Arsenal have made a bid for Chelsea's central defender William Gallas but are unwilling to match his \u00a370,000-a-week salary. The Frenchman only has to apologise to the Portuguese coach for missing Chelsea's pre-season training in the US to return to the fold, and Mourinho, after seeing his side lose at Middlesbrough on Wednesday, is already planning for a season without Cole. Mourinho said: \"I don't know what the situation is but if, on the 31st of August, we cannot get Cole then it is not a drama.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
