The incoming brief for the new social services minister, Anne Ruston, does not appear to list the drug-testing trial as either a key matter for attention in the government\u2019s first 100 days or a \u201ckey milestone\u201d for the coming 12 months. The brief, obtained by Guardian Australia through freedom of information laws, shows other controversial policies, such as the cashless welfare card expansion, required more urgent attention. A bill to trial drug-testing of welfare recipients in three locations across two years remains before the Senate. Earlier attempts to pass the legislation failed to win requisite crossbench support. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The internal brief lists the trial\u2019s cost at $5.6m. The department of social services flags the need to give the minister \u201cadvice\u201d about progressing the trial, but the advice does not appear anywhere in the heavily redacted document. Ruston told Guardian Australia the drug-testing trial remains government policy, but did not say whether the government would attempt to push the bill through the Senate this term. She said only that the trial was \u201csubject to the passage of legislation\u201d, offering no time-frame. \u201cSubstance abuse can be a barrier to employment with consequences for individuals and their families, our communities and our entire welfare system,\u201d Ruston said. \u201cThe trial is about testing new ways of identifying job seekers with substance abuse issues, helping them to overcome these issues and increasing their chances of gaining employment.\u201d The drug-testing trial provoked controversy when proposed in 2017. The trial aimed to test 5,000 new recipients of Newstart and some Youth Allowance payments in Canterbury-Bankstown in Sydney, Logan in Queensland and Mandurah in West Australia. Those who tested positive would be placed on income management for 24 months, restricting their spending. They would also be sent for treatment, if required. Failing to undergo the treatment would result in punishment through Centrelink\u2019s compliance system, which can lead to the suspension or cancellation of a payment. Refusing to undergo the drug test would prompt the immediate cancellation of payments. The policy was widely condemned by drug treatment specialists, doctors, welfare advocates, Labor and the Greens. Patrick McGorry, the former Australian of the Year and mental health expert, said the policy was an \u201cabsolute disgrace\u201d that would push vulnerable Australians away from the welfare system, possibly into homelessness. \u201cIt fails to recognise that mental illness and drug and alcohol problems nearly always coexist, (and that) they\u2019re a health problem and not a lifestyle choice,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a justification for basically withdrawing welfare support because the consequences could be things like homelessness and major hardship.\u201d The United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, warned the policy would \u201cstigmatise\u201d the poorest members of society. He said the policy would not help to save the government money, because it cost between $500 and $900 per individual. The government says it is not aiming to save money, only to divert drug-takers to treatment. \u201cThe Australian government is conflating social protection and drug enforcement policies in a way that is counterproductive, unless the main goal is to stigmatise social security recipients,\u201d Alston said in a statement. \u201cIf the real goal is to reduce the use of illegal drugs, why start with the poorest members of society?\u201d \u201cWill there also be a policy designed to drug-test and crack down on the well-to-do, who spend far more on drugs and receive all sorts of tax deductions, social security payments and other government benefits?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
