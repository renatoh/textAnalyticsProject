But this time his back just went. Physically, there's no way he can do anything and he'll be sleeping on the floor for two weeks.\" The former world featherweight champion, who has not fought since losing his undefeated record to the Mexican Marco Antonio Barrera last April, will have x-rays today to determine whether or not he has sustained any long-term damage, but indications are that the problem is muscular. Heading off cynics who have suggested Hamed was having difficulty in making the nine-stone featherweight limit and was using the injury as a convenient excuse to take more time to prepare, Riath said: \"His weight was bang on. I'm worried idiots will talk crap about why the fight is off, but if it was up to Naz he'd have waited a few days to see if he could have gone ahead. \"He's not as worried about his back as the fact that we've had to postpone the fight.\" Similarly, speculation that ticket sales might have been slow was also rejected, with Riath claiming fans had already bought more than 10,000. His principal difficulty, he said, lay in funding the administrative cost of refunds and the cancellation of the London Arena. The difficulty of finding a suitable slot in the schedules of the American television company HBO, which pays the bulk of Hamed's pay cheque, means he may have to wait until June for an alternative date even if he makes a rapid recovery. The British Boxing Board of Control are likely to allow Audley Harrison's fight against Minehead part-timer Greg Wedlake, 32, to go ahead at Wembley on April 20, even though questions have been raised over Wedlake's competence and fitness after fighting only once in more than four years. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
