To assume that the Sudanese revolution would manage to topple not only Omar al-Bashir but also uproot the deeply entrenched network of military and security interests behind him was always optimistic. But the success of the protests so far, and the extent and consistency of the protesters\u2019 efforts, offered a glimmer of hope that while civilians were negotiating with the transitional military government to end military rule, their leverage in the streets was strong. It became obvious, however, that the military regime and its associated security bodies were simply playing for time. And they have finally run out of patience. On Monday night the massacre began. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group created from the remnants of the infamous Janjaweed militia, moved against the main areas where sit-ins were occurring in Khartoum and opened fire. The troops burned the encampments, beat whoever they did not kill, and blockaded roads and hospitals so that medical support could not reach the wounded and the dying. There are reports of rape, pillage, and the bodies of the executed floating in the river Nile. The country was then plunged into a communications blackout, with sporadic access to the internet only producing howls of bereavement and desperation as the faces of missing loved ones were circulated on social media. The body count continues to rise; the last official figure was 31, but dozens more are missing and hundreds are injured. These are unfamiliar scenes in Khartoum. In Darfur, where the Janjaweed originated, and in other parts of Sudan from where Bashir\u2019s government, holed up in the garrison city of Khartoum, dispatched mercenaries to violently suppress rebellion, they were commonplace. But rebellion has finally come to Khartoum, and so the Janjaweed, briefly restrained by the military and led by the deputy leader of the transitional government, were unmuzzled to do what they do best \u2013 scorched-earth suppression. It was always clear that the Sudanese revolution was going to be a long process of attrition. The protesters were praised for their canniness in understanding that, even though the dictator had been toppled, there would be no returning home until the military went back to the barracks. There would be no hoodwinking them with transitional periods and election promises only made in order to give the \u201cnew\u201d military government time to bed in. But the immensity of the task has quickly become clear. Bashir\u2019s regime not only impoverished the country and murdered its restive and marginalised ethnic groups, it created an entire parallel security infrastructure outside the army. This grew from an informal ragtag band of village-torchers into a large organised body with its own culture, its own economy, its own grudges against the coddled elites of Khartoum \u2013 even its own foreign policy and funding. An organised body that seems to relish the opportunity to show those comfortable Khartoum dwellers \u2013 absent from the bush and desert, the wars and skirmishes of the past 20 years \u2013 who is boss. What the Sudanese revolution is reckoning with now is the very heart of Bashir\u2019s government distilled into its essential parts: networks of patronage with too much to lose, militias grown too large to disband, and dirty deals with regional allies too important to jettison. The RSF and the military\u2019s foreign alliances with the powers of the Gulf represent another front against the Sudanese revolution. The RSF\u2019s leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, has supported the Saudi war in Yemen by providing Sudanese soldiers \u2013 some of them reported to be children \u2013 in exchange for financial assistance. The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia\u2019s partner in the coalition in Yemen, also has a strong interest in ensuring that this access to Sudan\u2019s cannon fodder continues. Egypt, another ally in the axis of the counter-revolution, is also wary of any civilian government in Sudan. A delegation from the Sudanese military council met with representatives of all three countries in the run-up to this week\u2019s massacre, strongly suggesting that the plan was hatched \u2013 or at least blessed \u2013 by these allies, eager to prevent the disruption of any military support they receive from Sudan, and keen to avoid the undesirable optics of a successful civilian revolution in the region. And so the Sudanese revolution is fighting against four governments. The international community \u2013 so interested and morally exercised by Bashir\u2019s human rights abuses in the past that it has left Sudan hobbled by years of economic sanctions and international isolation \u2013 has now moved on. It will only issue the usual boilerplate condemnations of violence. The Sudanese remain alone, locked in a death grip with a government that has now dropped all pretence of negotiation or compromise. Layer by layer, Bashir\u2019s regime has been stripped back to show its true face. There is no longer any amnesty afforded to those from the right class or ethnic background, if the price for that mercy would mean the relinquishing of power. Sudan\u2019s wars have come home to the capital. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
