First performed in Dublin in 1742, it arrived in London the following year, where it was introduced at Covent Garden with a lineup of soloists more suited to theatre than oratorio. Over the next few years Handel continued to adapt the score according to the singers he had at his disposal. In 1750, when he secured the services of a top-flight lineup - including the castrato Guadagni, who would go on to create the role of Gluck's Orfeo - he substantially embellished his score, satisfying his audience's taste for spectacular coloratura singing. That is the version of Messiah that Ren\u00e9 Jacobs opts for on this recording, with the counter-tenor Lawrence Zazzo taking on the intensely florid version of But Who May Abide? that Handel concocted for Guadagni. The performance has the familiar Jacobs qualities: an imaginative lightness of touch, fleetness and transparency with a cultivated quintet of soloists and neatly responsive contributions from the mixed choir of Clare College."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
