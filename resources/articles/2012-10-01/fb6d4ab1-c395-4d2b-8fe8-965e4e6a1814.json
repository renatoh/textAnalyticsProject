Capitalism has not accomplished that remarkable feat by itself. It is more down to the combination of science's capacity to transform how we live and a capitalism constantly pushed and prodded by democratic governments towards exploiting those opportunities. Growth in Britain and the west will return when that combination of innovation and good capitalism is rekindled. It is the great general purpose technologies (GPTs) \u2013 the steam engine, the aeroplane and the computer \u2013 that transformed our lives and economies. A GPT is a technology whose extraordinary usefulness demands that the original is constantly reinvented and updated. Thus, today's high-speed passenger train derives from the same technology as a 19th-century steam train, even if the model has been radically transformed. What's more, a GPT has multiple benefits for the economy and society. The train, for example, was not just a means of getting from A to B. It helped create the nation state, transformed the nature of war, fostered urbanisation and served as a catalyst for the growth of national newspapers \u2013 and much more besides. In the 1930s, evolving GPTs helped drive economic recovery, aided by a capitalism that had been reformed after the excesses of the 1920s. Recovery from today's barely contained depression will require the same alchemy. The trouble is Britain, first into the Industrial Revolution, has only thought fitfully about what constitutes a good productive capitalism and the innovation process. And this is etched into our culture and economic thinking. Innovation is much more complex than inventors' light bulb moments, the profit motive and the \"magic\" of markets. In essence, it is about jumps across boundaries to combine something new with the old. But success involves three key preconditions. It needs originators and load bearers of ideas; it needs recipients who are open to the arrival of the new; and it needs mechanisms for sharing and mitigating the existential risk that is associated with innovation. Innovation happens best in open societies that invest in the creation and spreading of knowledge, but also where there are institutions and social contracts to handle the risk. Britain, by this reckoning, should be innovative. What is missing, however, are the systems able to translate the new into great companies. The issue can no longer be dodged. There is no vast imperial market, no North Sea oil, no prospective credit boom to bail us out. Unless Britain can create the networks, the open innovation culture and the institutions to support innovative risk-taking, we will be locked in stagnation for decades. Some foundations are in place, in our great research-based universities. Nearly all are aware of both their responsibilities and their opportunities. The question is how to proceed fast and effectively when in so many areas \u2013 life science, genomics, the brain, sustainable energy, new materials, big data \u2013 the challenges are so huge, the avenues down which science might proceed so many and possibilities for mistakes so expensive. In this context, conventional approaches to research are inadequate. Our great universities are cash constrained, hoping their teams will deliver the breakthrough that can be patented to deliver rich returns, with the research councils reinforcing this approach with ever tighter terms for research grants. What is needed is a revolution. Universities need to be freed from the suffocating inhibition to create patents and copyrights for themselves through go-it-alone research, which often means they replicate each other's work (in areas where, in any case, the chance of success are small). Instead, they should become transformative, open, innovation hubs aiming to create knowledge as a public good. One model is the Structural Genomics Consortium at Oxford, host to eight leading drug companies that are co-funding frontier research that none could do on their own. This has already achieved more in two years than any single company could have achieved in 10. The issue is risk. Only by co-creating, pooling effort and underwriting the science with public investment many times larger than today's are the breakthroughs likely to happen. The US could be the global leader, given the strength of its universities and the scale of federal support for science. But it is mired in a culture of patenting and copyrighting everything; plus the Republican party wants to slash the crucial state funding. Britain could strike out in a different direction. We should aim to be the world's leading open innovation hub, a magnet for scientific endeavour and creator of public knowledge. But our entrepreneurs and businesses have to be organised to benefit from this shift. Otherwise, we are simply offering the rest of the world a free lunch. We need a German-style system of knowledge transfer into the private sector. We have the Technology Strategy Board and business secretary Vince Cable is creating \"Catapult\" centres to undertake commercially orientated research. But the ambition is too limited and the pace of roll-out painfully slow. Our intellectual property regime needs to be reorganised to favour open innovation, experimentation and cheap licensing. The Intellectual Property Office is beginning to tiptoe towards less restrictive patenting; it should be encouraged to go further faster. We need companies to recognise for themselves that innovation is a collaborative process, opening themselves to outside influences and new ideas. One of the aims of the Big Innovation Centre (which I chair) is to provide a catalyst for this way of thinking. But to capitalise on the opportunity, our companies need to be better owned, with committed shareholders dedicated to growing through innovation. They need a financial system that will supply them with the capital and loans they need. Large companies and government alike need to be early adopters of new ideas to provide markets for innovation. And Britain must remain a member of the European single market to offer our companies the chance of producing at continental scale. Better ownership, better finance and open innovation are thus mutually reinforcing \u2013 key ingredients of a new capitalism. Put aside grim austerity and mindless public deficit cutting: the road to nowhere. Britain must set out to be a leading global innovation hub and strain every muscle to pull it off. It is the only conceivable future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
