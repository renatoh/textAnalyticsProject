They use standard songs to get their bearings, but choose which and when and who plays what on the fly. Tepfer, Janisch and Williams add up to a superb piano trio in their own right, and Konitz picks up their suggestions and supplies his own with his characteristically wispy, falling-leaves phrases, sly bebop figures and wincing, sweet-sour treble tone. Tepfer is a little too much in Konitz's face on the bebop classic Billie's Bounce, but the band are subtly intertwined on a drifting, fitfully swinging All the Things You Are, while the luxuriously emphatic bass intro to Alone Together is a reminder of Janisch's musicality and power, and Konitz's signature song, Subconscious Lee, is a fast-moving and inventive ensemble conversation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
