Mr Alexander, who is set to collect about \u00a35m from the takeover, planned to \"go out and play\" once the deal was done. \"I've got cars I've never driven, a family I hardly ever see and a house in France I hardly ever get to visit,\" he said. He wanted to inform staff of the new team as soon as possible to ensure a smooth transition. The finance head, Alan Gow, will be managing director with Joe Steel, commercial director, who co-founded the business, as his deputy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
