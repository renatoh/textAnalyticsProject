Her heavy vowels pull him in and down, she weeps the first time he enters her. Digby, who hasn't had much experience of sex, sees himself as blessed and exceptionalised by this moment of tenderness until, 10 years later, just before the birth of their son Theo, she admits that all along she was crying for someone else. After that, she leaves him but stays in his home, living like any free woman who can afford a yellow E-type Jaguar. \"Why had he been so generous when in his heart he felt she'd eviscerated him?\" Digby doesn't know. Later still, she returns from death - literally, it would seem - to harry him off his last chance of a life. As an adult, Theo womanises his way across south London, playing in the evenings a jazz trumpet of genius, but scattering by day a spent confetti of bad marriages, debts, failed attempts to understand himself. He makes no money. He lives for his music. He does time for drugs. Digby, as puzzled by Theo's art as by his fecklessness, finances both: while Theo blames Digby for his mother's death. Digby, driven inward by age, and finding partial occupation in his history of bone china and partial solace in the belief that he can see angels, reads Theo's indigence as one more index of a faulty world. By the time we meet them, at the dead dog-end of the 20th century, all this has become too difficult. They have nothing more to say to one another, and poor Theo - like many a Wall protagonist before him - is on his way down. Unable to work, unable even to ask for money, he fetches up in Hastings, the Leytonstone of the south coast. In Theo and Digby we see the misfired central relationship of arts patronage: the doomed son's monologue to the father; the father's doomed monologue to the son. Meanwhile, among the book's subsidiary characters, James and his son Howard eschew a relationship of patronage for one of collaboration - bracingly heedless, it seems, of that destructive old Romantic division between art and industry. James is a 1960s fashion snapper who has turned to photographing churches, Howard a post-Seattle anarchist whose teasing absence for most of the novel provides both its mystery and its political still-centre, the value the absence of which is being demonstrated. In Howard's world, poverty isn't part of art, because art has control over its own means. The author fields his pair of opposites with a sardonic eye - as a product, perhaps, of what he calls \"philosophy's dark anarchic secret; Seneca's grin\". Previous Wall narratives have taken their drive from the visionary impulse itself. Here, monomania is present - indeed, presiding - but played with the mute on, and China substitutes a kind of bittersweet urban meander, much like the zigzag of Theo's band, Zeno, from jazz pub to jazz pub in Balham or Wandsworth. All the usual invigorating rants, about books and art and sex and literacy and people who collect things, are here, too - along with Wall's compulsive, clattering, often chokingly funny balancing act along the back fence between scholastic snobbery and grisly bohemianism - but purveyed on a good-naturedly human scale. The text is springy with pun and glittering with multiple internal parallel. As a result, China presents, at first, as a lighter, less harrowing work than The School of Night or The Lightning Cage, then rakes deeper than either. Its concerns seem more naked for being phrased lightly; its anger is less canalised into obsession. Constant high-energy collisions between classical and romantic - affect and intelligence, anarchy and anality - feel desperate in the best possible way. Auctorial pressure on the characters is relentless. From beginning to end they are pressed to make human sense of themselves. Trapped in Zeno's paradox, the paradox of motion, the terror of not being able to catch up though you can see the object of pursuit so clearly in front of you, they would have been perfectly capable of living without an explicatory or totalising context, you suspect: but once they started to look for one, they were done for. Their intelligence is not up to it, yet they can't trust their emotions to see them through. The best they can expect is that \"curious climatic restraint that seems somehow to reflect itself in the psychology of those who've learnt to live at peace inside the weather\". Though he sometimes appears to be both, Wall is neither dispassionate nor cruel. Nevertheless he's determined in the way only a Yorkshire novelist can be, so there was some risk that China would leave its readers, not to say its characters, feeling exhausted and browbeaten. By and large, Wall avoids this, and a surprisingly optimistic ending completes a dense, poetic, exhilarating, intensely readable book."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
