Follow our live updates on the Republican debate \u2013 and Trump\u2019s rival event \u2013 here. A Saudi prince, multibillionaire and major News Corp stockholder has gotten into the fray with Donald Trump, in a surreal Twitter feud prompted by the New Yorker\u2019s retweet of a photoshopped image. The photoshopped image shows Fox host Megyn Kelly with prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Alsaud, and text says a simple Google search will reveal the Saudi media mogul is a \u201cco-owner\u201d of Fox News. A simple Google search instead turns up the work of estimable fact-checkers at Politifact, who in 2014 found the relationship between the prince and News Corp to be a little more complicated than conservative memes have it. The photo is fake, and the text mostly false. In February last year bin Talal unloaded most of his stake in News Corp and retained 6.6% of his stake in 21st Century Fox \u2013 \u201cco-owner\u201d is decidedly overstating it. A negative political ad that dare not speak its name, save \u201cI\u2019m Bernie Sanders, and I approved this message.\u201d Rand Paul is speaking at a rally at Drake University in Des Moines. He invokes To Kill a Mockingbird and tells students that he\u2019s the candidate for Americans who want to be left alone. He says that this election reminds him of the character Scout, who \u201cfound the inner humanity that exists even in a mob bent on violence\u201d. He says he\u2019ll end the \u201cmob intent on detention without trial\u201d. Paul goes on to say that he\u2019s reminded of the book\u2019s other hero, Atticus Finch, when he thinks about how the majority can be wrong; he leaves it unsaid that they can be wrong even in a democracy. \u201cI thought of what Atticus said: before I can live with other folks, I\u2019ve got to live with mysefl. The one thing that doesn\u2019t abide majoity rule is conscience.\u201d Then he paraphrases Victor Hugo, maybe just for fun: \u201can idea whose time as come is stronger than all armies\u201d. He finishes off by calling for a bigger, more diverse Republican party: one that treats addiction \u201cas a health problem, not an incarceration problem\u201d; that reforms the criminal justice system and ends the war on drugs; that fights off big government and IRS Swat teams at every turn. \u201cForty-eight federal agencies, from the IRS to the Department of Education, that all have their own Swat teams. Is that freedom?\u201d \u201cNo-o-o-o-o,\u201d the crowd moans back. A cursory Google search casts some serious doubt on the notion that either the IRS or the DoE have \u201cSwat teams\u201d, though both agencies have enforcement agents. \u201cIt\u2019s the common desire to be left alone that binds us all as unique individuals,\u201d Paul says. \u201cAfter all big government hurts people from all walks of life, rich and poor.\u201d In 2016 your vote is not enough \u2013 politicians want your friends, your photos, your favorite TV shows and every click and keyboard tap you\u2019ve ever made. Facebook has made itself available to help, for a fee. My colleagues Harry Davies and Danny Yadron report from San Francisco. Facebook, which told investors on Wednesday it was \u201cexcited about the targeting\u201d, does not let candidates track individual users. But it does now allow presidential campaigns to upload their massive email lists and voter files \u2013 which contain political habits, real names, home addresses and phone numbers \u2013 to the company\u2019s advertising network. The company will then match in-real-life voters with their Facebook accounts, which follow individuals as they move across congressional districts and are filled with insightful data. The data is encrypted and not maintained by Facebook after ads run, the company said. Acxiom, a massive data broker based in Little Rock, Arkansas, helps campaigns upload the voter info. But a campaign operative said the Texas senator has been using Facebook ads to raise money, among other things, and a Guardian analysis shows Cruz-affiliated donors are spending $10,000 per day on Facebook \u201cplacement\u201d as the first vote nears. The Cruz campaign has a Facebook operation in place to harvest voter data by issues \u2013 everything from immigration to fireworks \u2013 but they are not alone. Facebook is \u201cplaying a key role in shaping the public perception of a candidate definitely more so than in the past\u201d, said Marie Danzig, former deputy digital director for the 2012 Obama campaign. With campaigns estimated to spend more than $1bn in digital advertising, half on social media, Facebook stands to profit off its users enormously this year. CEO Sheryl Sandberg told investors on Wednesday that campaigns will be able to target by congressional district, interest, demographics, etc. \u201cAnd we\u2019re seeing politicians at all levels really take advantage of that targeting.\u201d You can read the full report through the link below. \u201dShe failed me,\u201d Susan Sarandon bemoaned of Hillary Clinton earlier today, referring to the then senator\u2019s vote to support the US invasion of Iraq. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t just a mistake, it was a disaster.\u201d The actor\u2019s thrown her support behind Bernie Sanders, whose campaign lists her as one of his surrogates to talk to the media. She teared up introducing him on Thursday morning: \u201cthis may be the only man that can come up through the system, through the pipeline, unscathed, unsold and pure. And we know have the opportunity to make that man our choice for the president of the United States.\u201d \u201cI got emotional just being with him,\u201d she told CNN on Thursday. \u201cBernie Sanders consistently has represented everything that I\u2019m interested in and care about.\u201d Meanwhile, a senator who won cases in front of the supreme court of the United States of America is out doing this. And yet people don\u2019t like him. Observations apropos Donald Trump\u2019s alternate-debate-rally event/site, which Trump just linked to at DonaldTrumpForVets.com The camo-painted face of a young man looking serious and soldierly is in fact a Ukrainian actor in a stock photo by a Ukrainian photographer. The other photos are stock too (via Buzzfeed\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski). \u201cTrump could have his cake and eat it, too: he told people this afternoon he might go to debate tonight after his event\u201d (via New York Magazine\u2019s Gabriel Sherman \u2026 and conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh). The charitable foundation to which DonaldTrumpForVets.com directs you to is the Donald J Trump Foundation, which between 2009 and 2013 gave only a tiny fraction of its total donations to veterans organizations. In those four years it gave $57,000 of $5.5m to veterans groups; the rest went to 291 other organizations (via Forbes\u2019 Emily Canal, who dug up the tax forms). The billionaire has made no charitable contributions to his own Donald J Trump foundation since 2008, as of last August (via the Associated Press, also through tax filings). It\u2019s not clear whether Trump has given to the Wounded Warrior Project, a huge and growing veterans charity, but he has also often said he will support \u201cthe wounded warriors\u201d. A New York Times investigation heard from ex-staffers that the charity has a for-profit structure and spends massively on hotels, flights and meals. Campaign entrances, Iowa edition. How many false alarms were there before the right guy walked in? Republican savior, GOP Obama or something else entirely? Marco Rubio has tried to frame himself as the future of the conservative party but struggled to break free from the pack of his party. Seeing how voters have responded to Trump\u2019s outrage and Cruz\u2019s fear, Rubio\u2019s gone dark. my colleague Sabrina Siddiqui reports from Des Moines: When the senator reached his final stop on Wednesday, the mood was noticeably darker. He began with a joke about how his wife had come up with a solution for cold weather campaigning by gifting him the same sweater in every color for Christmas, but he soon pivoted to a more serious note. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had a president not interested in fixing the problems in America,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first time that we have a president that believes that America is an arrogant global power that needed to be cut down to size.\u201d The portrait only grew bleaker. Obama, by his account, had left the country in ruins \u2013 damage so irreparable that simply electing any Republican might not be enough to reverse course. \u201cThis is hard, but it\u2019s the truth: America is a great nation in decline,\u201d Rubio says. \u201cWe are not a weak country. We just have a weak president. And this year we are going to change that.\u201d You can read more about the senator\u2019s strategy of out-despairing other Republicans, and his attempts to handle Trump et al from afar, down through the link below. Also in Iowa, the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs finds irony in Rubio\u2019s latest campaign line. The Democratic candidates may get more debates after all: the Clinton campaign is now calling for more stage appearances, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Laura Meckler tweets. For weeks the Democratic National Committee has ignored grumbling from Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley, the former Maryland governor who is inching along at under 2% in the polls. Both have suggested that the DNC is trying to limit airtime for Clinton\u2019s rivals. Bloomberg\u2019s Jennifer Epstein has a statement from Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon. Is Hillary Clinton religious? Your answer might say more about you than her, according to a new Pew survey that found opinions largely trend along political lines. For Americans who lean Democratic, 65% see Clinton as \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d religious, compared with 27% who say she is \u201cnot too\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d religious. For those who lean Republican, \u201cthese figures are almost exactly reversed: 65% say she is not religious, while just 28% say she is at least somewhat religious\u201d. Overall, this adds up to an American public that is split in its view of the role of religion in Clinton\u2019s life. Roughly half of U.S. adults overall (48%) say Clinton is at least somewhat religious, while a slightly smaller share (43%) say she is not religious and 9% express no opinion. Roughly half of all Americans (51%) say it\u2019s important to have a president who shares their religious beliefs. However, sharing beliefs matters more to Republicans (64%) than to Democrats (41%). If you\u2019d like to read more about Clinton, Obama, Republicans and religion, check out what Pew\u2019s got to say here. Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee will join Donald Trump at his alternate-debate event on Thursday, the Republican candidates\u2019 campaigns have announced. Santorum and Huckabee are hovering near zero in the polls, far below Trump\u2019s 37.4% lead by national averages. Santorum, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, is competing with Huckabee primarily for evangelical voters. They are polling at 0.5% and 2.4% respectively. Huckabee appeared on CNN after announcing he would attend Trump\u2019s event, saying: \u201cit\u2019s not an endorsement of Trump\u2019s candidacy. I\u2019m still running for president.\u201d Trump scheduled an fundraiser \u201cto help the wounded warriors\u201d on Wednesday, after he quit the Fox News debate scheduled for Thursday night. Trump pushed the network to keep anchor Megyn Kelly, who asked him pointed questions in the first Republican debate, from being a moderator, but Fox refused his demand in a mocking press release. Struggling to define himself in the race against billionaire Donald Trump, Cuban-Texan Ted Cruz and the specter of a young senator with a message of hope, Marco Rubio has boiled his campaign down to one aim: defeat Hillary Clinton. Sabrina Siddiqui reports with the exclusive from Des Moines: With days remaining before the Iowa caucuses, Marco Rubio is framing the choice before voters as boiling down to one thing: Defeating Hillary Clinton. In a new television ad, shared first with the Guardian, Rubio focuses his closing argument on the need for change in the White House after two terms of Barack Obama. \u201cAmerica is exceptional. Every generation before us met the great challenges of their time. But after seven long years of this president, we feel our country slipping away,\u201d Rubio says, speaking straight to the camera. \u201cThis election is about defeating Hillary Clinton and about saving what makes America unique. I\u2019m Marco Rubio. I approved this message and I am asking for your vote so we can leave our children what our parents left us: the single greatest nation in all mankind.\u201d The ad will begin airing across Iowa on Thursday, five days before the state holds the first nominating contest in the 2016 presidential primaries. Rubio is currently polling in third in Iowa behind Donald Trump and Texas senator Ted Cruz, and is widely regarded as the most likely candidate to break through as an alternative who would be palatable to both conservatives and the establishment. The Florida senator has been traveling across Iowa since Saturday, honing in on electability as he makes his final pitch to voters. Several polls have shown Rubio as the more formidable Republican opponent to Clinton. \u201cIf you nominate me, we won\u2019t just unify the Republican Party, we will grow the conservative movement,\u201d Rubio has said at a series of town halls and rallies this week. \u201cI\u2019m taking the conservative message to people that haven\u2019t voted for us before.\u201d \u201cWe cannot lose this election,\u201d he has added. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton is elected president of the United States, the consequences will be extraordinary. Donald Trump would be the first to tell you he\u2019s a man of many accomplishments. Somewhere down that tremendous list is one he probably didn\u2019t predict: breaking the grip of Fox News over conservative media and scattering talking heads, bloggers and politicians across various tribes of pro- and anti-Trump thinking. Trump\u2019s feud with Fox over the anchor Megyn Kelly, whose incisive questions have aggravated the billionaire for months, reached a new low on Wednesday when he announced he would skip the network\u2019s Thursday debate. But while Fox News kingpin Roger Ailes could once use his network to influence conservative voters and, arguably, shape the Republican party, Trump has baffled him and divided his audience. The fractures are especially obvious online, where anyone can find kinship in the comments or on a blog. In the last 24 hours, for instance, the rightwing site Breitbart, founded by a man \u201ccommitted to the destruction of the old media guard\u201d, has churned out posts critical of Fox News. The headlines blare in all-caps: \u201cFox News debate chief has daughter working for Rubio\u201d, \u201cHow Trump beat Roger Ailes at his own game\u201d, \u201cthe anti-Trump network: Fox News money flows into open border group\u201d. The Blaze stakes out the opposite camp. There are invitations to read a letter from Ted Cruz to Trump, to watch Bill O\u2019Reilly \u201ctake on Trump\u201d, to hear how Glenn Beck \u201cgoes nuclear on \u2018bully\u2019 Donald Trump\u201d, and to read \u201cthe words sexist Twitter trolls hurled at Megyn Kelly\u201d. Somewhere in the middle are sites like the Daily Caller, which has mostly reposted various opinions: there\u2019s Fox\u2019s Kelly and Krauthammer, support for Trump from Pat Buchanan, a conservative populist who won Iowa in 1996, and news about a veterans\u2019 group that\u2019s leery of Trump\u2019s donations. Or you can look at a kinkajou that fell asleep on a 99-year-old in Florida. Matt Drudge, the conservative dungeon master behind the Drudge Report, has aggregated a menagerie from all sides. \u201cO\u2019Reilly begs: You owe me milkshakes\u201d, \u201cJeb blew through is warchest\u201d, \u201cHuckabee calls Cruz a flip flopper\u201d. There\u2019s also a woman \u201cwho lives as a cat\u201d, robot lettuce farmers, and \u201cconsumers of frozen vegetables [who] oppose abortions\u201d. The spat between Trump and Ailes reflects a larger war for control of the Republican party that has been playing out for months, if not years, and upended the order of conservative politics. Hoary magazines are reduced to ad hominem editions. Lifelong standard bearers of the party, like former speaker of the House John Boehner, have been ousted by irascible newcomers. The hate felt for one candidate and the ghosts of another have pushed even \u201cestablishment\u201d leaders toward the mercurial, formerly liberal Trump. Ailes and Fox News, mocked for telling an established version of the news \u2013 usually white, older and ideological \u2013 are now taking the journalistic high ground by supporting Megyn Kelly and her tough, pertinent questions. Similarly, liberal-leaning MSNBC has resisted the Democratic party\u2019s attempt to limit debates. But the rise of more varied and radical voices online \u2013 and in the polls \u2013 suggests that the cable-news giants, like the leaders of both parties, are losing some influence over the masses they rely on. Sanders is speaking at a high school in Iowa, where actors Justin Long and Susan Sarandon are in attendance near-ish the Guardian\u2019s own DC bureau chief, Dan Roberts. Sanders met with Barack Obama on Wednesday in the White House, and apparently they talked shop about campaigning in Iowa. Earlier this week the president heaped praise on the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, and admitted that he didn\u2019t know Sanders as well as his former secretary of state. Students in the audience \u2013 not exactly a room full of eligible voters \u2013 get to ask the senator from Vermont some questions. One says \u201cI\u2019ve never had any formal sex education.\u201d Sanders: \u201cYou\u2019ve never had what?\u201d (Dan says that he recovers after having not heard.) One says climate change seems fake. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d Sanders tells her, per the Washington Post. Another asks about the Middle East, in particular the war in Iraq. Sanders stresses that he wants to keep American soldiers out of conflicts there. \u201cI went to funeral after funeral after funeral of kids not much older than you are.\u201d His campaign has also just released a letter about Sanders\u2019 health from his doctor of 26 years. \u201cYou are in overall very good health and active in your professional work,\u201d the doctor tells his patient, \u201cand recreational lifestyle without limitation.\u201d Bernie Sanders has announced he will co-sponsor a bill to repeal protections to gun manufacturers and dealers \u2013 a law he voted for in 2005, and for which Hillary Clinton has criticized Sanders for weeks. In 2005 Sanders voted for a bill that shields manufacturers and dealers from legal liability in cases \u201cresulting from criminal or unlawful misuse\u201d of their guns by a third party. Sanders was a member of the House of Representatives at the time, and 12 years earlier had voted against the Brady Bill, which imposed federal background checks and a waiting period on gun purchase. The bill, named after Ronald Reagan\u2019s press secretary Jim Brady, paralyzed by an assassin\u2019s gunshot meant for the president, eventually passed with Reagan\u2019s endorsement. Last year Sanders defended his vote on the liability bill, known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), with an argument that guns are merely a tool like any other. \u201cIf somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cand the murderer kills somebody with a gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible? \u201cNot any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer.\u201d Under the law, gun manufacturers and dealers have more protections than most other manufacturers of consumer goods. On Wednesday staff for Sanders campaign met with Hector Adames, a gun control advocates who has joined with the Brady Campaign. Adames\u2019 13-year-old nephew was shot dead in a gun accident, and in 2009 the US supreme court rejected their challenge of protections for the gun industry. In a call with reporters on Thursday, Adames said: \u201cI can\u2019t stop smiling, I\u2019m almost in shock.\u201d Adames said he and other advocates hoped for Sanders \u201cto make a wrong a right. That he responded so quickly is almost amazing.\u201d The Brady Campaign has endorsed Sanders\u2019 rival, Hillary Clinton, and the group\u2019s president, Dan Gross, said they still would \u201clike to see him admit that his vote in 2005 was a mistake\u201d. \u201cWe hope that his co-sponsorship of this bill is a genuine step in the right direction,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthis would\u2019ve been unthinkable a month ago.\u201d \u201cThe issue of gun violence prevention has reached a tipping point. We are winning.\u201d But Gross suggested that the group\u2019s support for Clinton would not waver because she \u201cdidn\u2019t wait until the campaign to champion gun violence prevention\u201d. Gun violence and gun control have been almost entirely absent from national politics since 2013, when Congress failed to pass a bill requiring universal background checks. By the measure of one tracker, there have been more than 1,000 mass shootings since the December 2012 attack that killed 20 children and six adults and spurred the 2013 bill. The issue has not been debated seriously between presidential campaigns in 15 years, though it has been raised repeatedly in this Democratic primary. Debate preview from the Donald. And the Stooges. Checking in with other Republicans on the trial, here\u2019s New Jersey governor Chris Christie talking about Donald Trump\u2019s habit of calling cable morning shows. \u201cHe sits in his jammies in Trump Tower and phones in. You guys don\u2019t let any of the rest of us do that,\u201d Christie told Fox News on Wednesday night. \u201cHe phones in to every darn show. None of the rest of us do that.\u201d Christie said that Trump was making a \u201cbig mistake\u201d with his decision to \u201cwhine and moan and complain and walk away\u201d from the Fox News debate. You can check out the whole exchange on Sean Hannity\u2019s show here. This morning, Kentucky senator Rand Paul is on the radio and the Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel is sitting listening to his libertarian-ish drawl. Paul told CNN this morning that he plans to win the election with a \u201csecret weapon\u201d: \u201cthe youth vote\u201d. Influential Iowa governor Terry Branstad is at a Wall Street Journal breakfast this morning and talking to a room full of reporters. Although the Republican says he won\u2019t endorse anyone, he has made his disdain for Ted Cruz clear. The Washington Post\u2019s Philip Rucker is listening in. Branstad says that he thinks Donald Trump\u2019s slogan, to \u201cmake America great again\u201d, has \u201cresonated\u201d with a lot of Republican voters. He\u2019s careful about criticizing the billionaire, talking up the big crowds that are showing up for Trump\u2019s rallies and suggesting his state will have record turnout on 1 February. Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. The last debate before primary season voting begins takes place tonight: one last chance for Republicans to show that they\u2019re better/worse than Donald Trump \u2026 or at least his empty podium. On Wednesday, Trump confirmed that he\u2019ll skip the debate in Des Moines because he doesn\u2019t like \u201cthe wise-guy press releases\u201d of host Fox News (or the awkward questions of Fox anchor Megyn Kelly). Ted Cruz, Trump\u2019s closest competitor in the Iowa polls (where people will finally decide an election on 1 February), promptly challenged Trump to a debate \u201cmano a mano\u201d, which means \u201chand to hand\u201d but in Republican Spanglish reads as \u201cmanly emasculation contest\u201d. Carly Fiorina, polling around 2% (34 points behind Trump), offered the billionaire $2m to do a one-on-one debate. But Trump says he\u2019ll hold a competing event to \u201craise some money for the wounded warriors\u201d. Cruz donors said they would give $1.5m to veterans if Trump debates their man, and Bush put down $20 that Trump will show for Fox. The other Republicans \u2013 Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, etc \u2013 still plan to show up for the Des Moines debate. On the other side of the race, the Red Hot Chili Peppers announced they will headline a fundraiser for Bernie Sanders, who also has Killer Mike, Susan Sarandon, Cornel West and Ben &amp; Jerry in his camp. Hillary Clinton held a fundraiser with Jon Bon Jovi in Philadelphia on Wednesday, so the competition for 80s rockers who went pop heavy in the 90s is fierce. Clinton leads Sanders in Iowa by less than a point, according to averaged polls, and trails the Vermont senator by 15 in New Hampshire by the same measure. Nationally, however, the former secretary of state has held her double-digit lead despite Sanders\u2019 incremental gains. A new poll has Trump ahead of Cruz by seven in Iowa, and Sanders up by 20 over Clinton in New Hampshire. Around the trail: Sabrina Siddiqui has shadowed Marco Rubio in New Hampshire, where the senator is going dark, presenting a gloomy future about any America that doesn\u2019t have him in charge. Sabrina and Gary Younge will be with Clinton this afternoon. DC bureau chief Dan Roberts is in Iowa after a day of watching a New York media tycoon take on a New York real estate tycoon. He\u2019ll be with Sanders today. Ben Jacobs will be with Republican senator Rand Paul, who\u2019s likely eager to take on Cruz in the debate and take back some skeptical voters from the Texas senator. West coast bureau chief Paul Lewis has infiltrated the headquarters of camp Cruz, learning what he can ahead of tonight\u2019s debate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
