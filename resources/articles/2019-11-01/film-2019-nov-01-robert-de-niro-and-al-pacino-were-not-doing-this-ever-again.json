He is sporting a veteran-boho look: what seems like about six black cardigans on top of each other, lots of chunky finger jewellery and messy bird\u2019s-nest hair. There may even be one of those two-inch ponytails that were popular in the late 80s in there somewhere \u2013 it is hard to see in the general tonsorial disorder. Next to stroll in is Robert De Niro, who \u2013 in dramatic contrast \u2013 looks like he has come in from a round of golf: shirt and sports jacket, grey-white hair slicked back. Welcome, then, to the Al and Bob show. Observing them here, in an intimate room full of selected journalists, you see how their personalities contrast as much as their dress sense. Pacino speaks in a barely audible bass rumble and is not short of waffle; De Niro, while not exactly monosyllabic, spends as much time nodding with his distinctive pursed-mouth underbite and says as little as he can get away with. That is, until we got on to the matter of a certain US president, of which more later. The pair \u2013 the film industry\u2019s equivalent of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards \u2013 are bona fide living legends, the greatest US actors of their generation, able to wipe the floor with modern lightweights such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Daniel Day-Lewis. Or that is what we would like to believe, anyway. Today, they have rolled into London as the main attraction on the press roadshow for The Irishman, Martin Scorsese\u2019s monumental new gangster picture \u2013 and there is a lot to get through. \u201cWow,\u201d says Pacino at one point, casting his mind back across the pair\u2019s career-long relationship. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for a really long time.\u201d For years, The Irishman was little more than a rumour; plagued by delays, distractions and drop-outs, it looked odds-on never to make it out of the starting gate. But, like a wiseguy fitted with a cement overcoat, it has landed thunderously in the middle of the autumn season, blowing away the rest of the awards-bait dross. The Irishman is the fourth in Scorsese\u2019s series of epic mafia pictures, following Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino; it is the latest variant of Scorsese\u2019s reinvention of mob life as an agonised stations of the cross. It is also the wintriest of character studies, contemplating (like Scorsese\u2019s last film, Silence) the approach of death with equanimity. The CGI that Scorsese added to \u201cde-age\u201d his actors, and the deal that the director made with Netflix to fund it, has unexpectedly put his film in the same camp as cutting-edge industry disrupters. Scorsese himself has acquired new cultural currency in recent months: the naked homage/appropriation by the makers of Joker has driven attention to his string of 70s masterworks, while his dismissive comments about superhero movies (\u201cnot cinema\u201d) \u2013 the first shots in the publicity campaign for The Irishman, as it happens \u2013 ignited a social media firestorm that is yet to die down. Yet, more fundamental than any of this is the sense that The Irishman is a landmark reunion of the old neighbourhood: a last gathering of the clans, a final get-together before age and time overtakes them. Harvey Keitel and Joe Pesci play ageing mob bosses, Pacino is a notorious union boss, Jimmy Hoffa, and De Niro is the Irishman, ice-cold real-life hitman Frank Sheeran. The Irishman turns on the relationship between Hoffa, whose disappearance and presumed murder in 1975 remains unsolved, and Sheeran, a hitherto little-known mob figure who confessed to killing Hoffa, his longtime friend, to the lawyer Charles Brandt, who included it in his 2004 biography of Sheeran, I Heard You Paint Houses. Hoffa and Sheeran provide suitably substantial figures for Pacino and De Niro to renew their on-screen confrontation, most vividly portrayed in the 1995 Michael Mann thriller Heat (the 2008 cop comedy Righteous Kill was slightly less memorable). Pacino says they met in 1968; at the time, Pacino was a firebrand stage actor yet to feature in films, while De Niro was doing wacky avant-garde movies such as Brian De Palma\u2019s Greetings. \u201cEarly on in our careers, we connected from time to time and we found we had similar things happening to us,\u201d says Pacino. \u201cOur lives took on a whole different kind of thing.\u201d It was camaraderie, he says, that \u201cgot us together\u201d. Looking back, their acting careers did seem to blossom with a mysterious symbiosis. Both acquired a reputation in their teens as a troublemaker: De Niro spent much of his youth in Little Italy, Manhattan; Pacino, three years older, grew up in the Bronx. Both scored major breakthroughs in the early 70s courtesy of the Italian-American presence in the Hollywood new wave: Pacino as the flint-hearted capo-in-waiting in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s gangster epic The Godfather in 1972, De Niro as a knockaround guy in Scorsese\u2019s Mean Streets a year later. The two appeared in the same film for the first time, although not together, in Coppola\u2019s Godfather sequel in 1974: De Niro played the young version of Pacino\u2019s father. Pacino gets a little dewy eyed; he looks a bit like a panda with a secret sorrow. \u201cWe\u2019re really close. We don\u2019t see each other very much, but when we do, we found we shared certain things. In a way, I think we\u2019ve helped each other throughout life.\u201d The thought of Tony Montana chewing things over with Jake LaMotta is not an image to trifle with. De Niro nods away, bottom lip almost wobbling, but there is no stopping Pacino. Their off-screen friendship, he says, has fed into their acting; in Heat, he says, \u201cwe were at opposite ends\u201d, whereas \u201cwe were close\u201d on Righteous Kill. They \u201chad a chance to explore that again\u201d on The Irishman: the relationship between Hoffa and Sheeran, who were friends for years before Sheeran\u2019s betrayal, is the nub of the film. \u201cI don\u2019t think we talked about it consciously. It came relatively easy, as those things go.\u201d When it is his turn to talk, De Niro is all business. The Irishman, it would appear, is as much his show as Scorsese\u2019s. He explains how he nagged Pesci on to the film, despite him having all but retired: \u201cI said: \u2018Come on, we\u2019re not going to do this ever again.\u2019\u201d Sentiment is not his thing. \u201cIt was tough enough to get it done, to get the money to do it and everything. I don\u2019t see us putting on a movie like this. I hope we do other films together, but like this? Not likely. This is it.\u201d Much ink has been spilled over the years on the De Niro-Scorsese axis, as well as the De Niro-Pacino one. But, bizarrely enough, Pacino and Scorsese had never worked together before. For two such high-profile princes of the Italian-American sensibility, that feels like a mistake. \u201cI know,\u201d rumbles Pacino, leaning in and turning worldly-wise. \u201cLike everything in this business, if you\u2019ve been in it for a while, you realise that things get started, but then they go in different places and they don\u2019t always culminate in a film. A couple of times, Marty and I were going to do something together, then they slip away.\u201d He mentions a Modigliani biopic he and Scorsese worked on in the 80s, which they tried and failed to get financed. \u201cHappens all the time.\u201d De Niro was the key in finally getting The Irishman off the ground. He and Scorsese had been mulling another project about a retired hitman for years, The Winter of Frankie Machine, adapted from the 2006 novel of the same name by Don Winslow. As it was gearing up, De Niro was directing his second film, The Good Shepherd, about the early days of the CIA; that film\u2019s writer, Eric Roth, gave him a copy of Brandt\u2019s Sheeran book as research. After reading it, De Niro took it straight to Scorsese. Just as Frankie Machine was about to get the green light from Paramount, Scorsese did the unthinkable: he walked away and started over again. More Scorsese films intervened \u2013 Shutter Island, Hugo, The Wolf of Wall Street, Silence \u2013 before schedules and money aligned and The Irishman could start shooting. For half a decade, De Niro says, the only relic of the film was a now-legendary table read in 2012, \u201cjust to have it documented so it could be shown to anybody who was interested\u201d. Every now and then, De Niro says, Pacino \u201cwould call me and ask: \u2018Is it happening?\u2019 I\u2019d say: \u2018Yeah, yeah, it\u2019s happening.\u2019 But it took a long time.\u201d So long, in fact, that they started to get too old to play their roles as originally conceived. Both actors are well into their eighth decade: Pacino is 79, De Niro 76. Scorsese had been clear that he did not want to use different actors for their middle-aged selves, who dominate the film\u2019s scenes. Enter the \u201cde-ageing\u201d CGI technology. \u201cNetflix came in and paid for the process,\u201d De Niro says. \u201cIt helped us all along.\u201d Did they get the willies confronting their younger versions? Sheepish guffaws ensue. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d asks De Niro. \u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d replies Pacino. Do they still enjoy the job? De Niro is pithy: \u201cIt\u2019s different, but I like it just as much.\u201d Pacino goes long: \u201cIt sort of depends on what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he says. \u201cI hate to say it, but you can go 20 years between inspirations.\u201d He stops for a moment, baffled by his own eloquence. \u201cBear with me \u2013 I\u2019m going through the bushes here and I\u2019ll come out with something.\u201d He says he is always on the lookout \u201cto find something that you really connect to, you really want to do\u201d. A lot of the acting he does is \u201cwork-rest\u201d, he says, so he can \u201cget back to looking around and seeing what\u2019s out there\u201d. De Niro nods along furiously. Pacino is in the groove. \u201cSometimes I feel I know nothing about acting. Until you start. That\u2019s what\u2019s exciting for me. A new character. I often say: \u2018Desire is more motivating than talent.\u2019 I\u2019ve seen people with great desire take it through. The truth is, it\u2019s the same thing that is always was: you are feeling this new character, this new person, this new story.\u201d As he grinds to a halt, Pacino looks pleased: he has come out with something all right. It is a great manifesto for a living legend. As the encounter starts to wind down, one big question \u2013 arguably the biggest \u2013 remains unasked. If it is about anything, The Irishman is about the gangsterisation of US politics, how the Cosa Nostra exploited opportunities to corrupt the electoral process and organised labour. Two big killings \u2013 those of John F Kennedy and Hoffa \u2013 are characterised as the outcome of mafia intervention in the political sphere. Some might say the US is still living with the legacy; as De Niro\u2019s version of Sheeran likes to say: \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d De Niro has a record on this: we know he hates Trump and has called him out time after time. But the way he suddenly takes over the room is amazing to behold: eyes like gun-sights, he gives Trump both barrels. \u201cWe have a real, immediate problem in that we have a gangster president who thinks he can do anything he wants.\u201d De Niro is livid; Pacino knows to keep quiet. \u201cIf he actually gets away with it, then we all have a problem. The gall of the people around him who actually defend him, these Republicans, is appalling.\u201d He does not call Trump a \u201cmook\u201d, but he may as well have. Instead, he has a message for the press: \u201cIt\u2019s a resentment of people like you guys, writing about what you see is obvious gangsterism. They don\u2019t like that, so they say: \u2018Fuck you, we\u2019re going to teach you people.\u2019 And they have to know they\u2019re going to be taught.\u201d This is De Niro unfiltered, and it is thrilling to experience it at close quarters. Does he think Trump will go to jail? \u201cOh, I can\u2019t wait to see him in jail. I don\u2019t want him to die. I want him to go to jail.\u201d And with that the Al and Bob show closes. De Niro abruptly resumes his affable persona and says goodbye; he and Pacino are swiftly escorted out. Trump \u2013 we can but hope \u2013 is quaking in his boots. But The Irishman roadshow rolls on. It is what it is. The Irishman is released in UK cinemas on 8 November and is on Netflix from 27 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
