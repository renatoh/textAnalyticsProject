April 2013 is certainly a moment of severe change in many important fields of public policy \u2013 further cuts and reforms in welfare spending, localisation of council tax benefit, wholesale reorganisation of commissioning within the NHS, new systems of regulation in financial services, cuts in legal aid and, at the end of this week, new lower top tax rates for higher earners and new raised tax thresholds for all. The question for politics is whether this will mark the breaking point for the resigned stoicism that has characterised public opinion since cutting the deficit became such a dominant issue. No one can be certain about that. The welfare state and the NHS will still exist in 2015. And to say this ought to be the breaking point does not make it so. The view that there is no, or not much, practical alternative is tenacious and not simply to be scorned. Yet it is about to be tested under fire. This week's changes are big, and there are a lot more still to come. Next week, benefit rates will be cut in real terms, while in the months to come a new benefit cap, and the universal credit, will be piloted and then go into general circulation. Bear in mind, too, that more than half of the total planned benefit cuts have yet to come into force. The practical outcome of these changes is extremely grim for hundreds of thousands of already financially hard-pressed people. And the Conservatives, however well-meaning some of them may be, will never be widely trusted with the welfare system. End of argument? Not necessarily. For one thing, the net effect of George Osborne's March budget is a modest giveaway to many taxpayers. That may help mitigate the effect of this week's changes for a lot of people, if only in the short term. Moreover, given the scale of the public debt, the continuing increase in public borrowing, and the rises in expenditure on welfare, pensions and health, there is a legitimate mainstream argument to be had about whether a mass of changes of this kind represents an attempt at a regrettable but necessary restructuring of some sort \u2013 whether well or badly executed is a separate but equally important argument \u2013 or simply an ideological onslaught on public spending in itself. There is certainly room for more greys as well as the usual blacks and whites in that argument, as Labour's marked reluctance to commit to reversing these changes underlines. But the coalition has few grounds for complacency. It has hugely damaged its own case by the sustained failure to stimulate growth in the economy. The early claim that four years of pain were necessary to get the public finances into balance has given way to a destructive downward spiral of stagnation followed by cuts, followed by more of both. Now there is little end in sight to either of them. The credibility of the measures coming into force this week is fatally undermined by that changed context. And this is reinforced by the fact that government policies can work in opposite directions. The so-called bedroom tax, for instance, is supposed to encourage mobility in social housing, yet social housing continues to give priority to those with a local connection, which is a disincentive to mobility. Meanwhile, as the Resolution Foundation argues, universal credit and raised income tax allowances \u2013 both flagship coalition policies \u2013 may be conspiring to cut, not increase, the incomes of the working poor. Ministers believe that the public mood has hardened against the benefits system. There is some evidence to support their view. But that would feel a lot stronger if the government's general economic strategy looked effective. In the continued absence of that, putting money into the hands of people who will spend it is one of the more effective ways of stimulating demand, yet the government is now actively taking it away from them. It all tends towards a politically devastating conclusion, well known from the chants of the football terraces. They don't know what they're doing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
