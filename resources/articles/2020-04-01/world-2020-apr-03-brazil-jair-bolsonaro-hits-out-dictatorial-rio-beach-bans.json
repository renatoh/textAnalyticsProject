In an interview on Thursday, Jair Bolsonaro hit out at Rio de Janeiro\u2019s governor, Wilson Witzel, who this week ordered the state\u2019s 17 million citizens to stay at home \u2013 and off the sands. \u201cBan people from going to the beach? My God!\u201d said Brazil\u2019s far-right president, who has faced protests and opposition from across the political spectrum for downplaying the threat of Covid-19. \u201cBeaches are outdoors. There\u2019s no problem going there at all,\u201d added Bolsonaro, contradicting guidelines from his own health ministry that crowds must be avoided. He mocked Rio\u2019s governor \u2013 a rightwing political rival \u2013 for ordering citizens to stay at home. \u201cWhat\u2019s he thinking? That this is some kind of dictatorship. What\u2019s that all about?\u201d On Tuesday, under growing pressure from both within and outside his government, Bolsonaro had appeared to finally recognise the severity of the coronavirus crisis. In an unusually restrained televised address, he called Covid-19 the \u201cgreatest challenge of our generation\u201d. But within hours he was again undermining attempts by Brazilian governors \u2013 who have nearly all ignored the president\u2019s guidance on coronavirus \u2013 to lock down their states, and denouncing coronavirus \u201chysteria\u201d on Twitter. On Thursday, as Brazil\u2019s death toll rose to 299 from 241 the previous day, the president continued to attack his political foes, even his own health minister, who Bolsonaro claimed \u201clacked humility\u201d. Bolsonaro also falsely suggested that an Associated Press photograph published on the front page of the Washington Post, showing dozens of graves being dug in S\u00e3o Paulo, might be fake. \u201cThis image \u2013 if it is real \u2013 should not be being made public,\u201d he said, calling such pictures \u201can embarrassment to Brazil\u201d. A prominent leftwing politician, Ciro Gomes, said this week that the only way to save Brazilian lives was through \u201can extensive campaign of civil disobedience initiated by governors, mayors, the overwhelming majority of religious leaders and the media\u201d. \u201cBolsonaro is an utterly fascist \u2026 and irresponsible man,\u201d Gomes said. \u201cHe has been his whole life.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
