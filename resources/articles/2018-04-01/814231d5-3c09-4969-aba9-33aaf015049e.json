A gently spreading pool of blood beneath the body on the rug. The scream of a servant. A houseful of suspects assembles. We can only be watching an Agatha Christie. WELCOME. If Holy Week and the advent of spring seems like an odd time to give viewers the secular, murdery treat that is a Christie adaptation \u2013 this time of her 1958 story Ordeal By Innocence \u2013 well, that\u2019s because it is. The three-part mystery was supposed to follow in the footsteps of writer Sarah Phelps\u2019 last two immaculate reworkings, And Then There Were None in 2015 and Witness for the Prosecution in 2016, and be the centrepiece of the 2017 Christmas schedule. When one of the actors involved, Ed Westwick, became the subject of multiple historical sexual assault allegations, the decision was taken not to broadcast Ordeal By Innocence and to reshoot with a new actor, Christian Cooke. The whole phalanx of actors \u2013 including Anna Chancellor as wealthy philanthropist and collector of waifs and strays Rachel Argyll (soon to have her skull decanted by the decanter); Bill Nighy as her widower Leo (soon to remarry with his frightful secretary Gwenda \u2013 played by Alice Eve, who at the last moment was unable to join them from the US and was split-screened in later); Morven Christie as the screaming servant; and Anthony Boyle as the apparent wielder of the fatal crystalware \u2013 reassembled in January and redid 35 scenes, with Cooke playing the volatile Mickey Argyll, one of Rachel\u2019s multitudinous now-adult orphan charges, in 12 days. If you didn\u2019t know, you wouldn\u2019t \u2013 a few stray icy breaths showing as they attempt to recreate a July setting in a Scottish location midwinter notwithstanding \u2013 be able to tell. The whole thing knits together seamlessly. It grabs you from the opening scenes, as Rachel is dispatched and Jack, always the most delinquent of her adopted children, is convicted \u2013 thanks to his fingerprints in her blood \u2013 of her murder despite his protestations of innocence. He is killed in prison. So far so good. But half an arch won\u2019t stand. Where is the rest of the premise? A year later, as the family gathers at the ancestral home for Leo and Gwenda\u2019s wedding and some illuminating flashbacks, it arrives. A nervous young stranger called Dr Arthur Calgary (a fine and unexpectedly moving, in Agatha\u2019s customarily affectless world, performance by Luke Treadaway) turns up with a suitcase and a claim that he can alibi Jack. The game, to quote Arthur Conan Doyle \u2013 the other master of detective fiction without whom neither the libraries nor TV schedules of England would long survive \u2013 is afoot. Like Christie on one of her husband\u2019s archeological digs, the next hour is spent sifting the mingled sands of truth and lies. Discrepancies in Arthur\u2019s story are discovered to arise from self-protection, not fraudulence. Bitter divisions in the family (and eyebrow-raisingly strong bonds \u2013 yes, Mickey and adopted sister Tina, I\u2019m looking at you) are gradually revealed \u2013 none deeper and more bitter than that between monstrous mother and children. Rachel, it turns out via a combination of flashing glances, elliptical threats and above all, the simple sense of barely repressed fury rippling through every atom of Chancellor\u2019s being, is A Piece of Work. We know not why \u2013 yet? \u2013 but she is the devil in disguise and has given just about everyone in Denouement Hall a reason to bump her off. From now on, it\u2019s just a matter of letting the danse macabre unfold. Phelps doesn\u2019t get in the way of Christie\u2019s careful choreography. However, she \u2013 and a uniformly brilliant cast that also boasts Matthew Goode as the supercilious Philip, who\u2019s clearly an absolute shit (especially to his wife, cowed Argullian daughter Mary, played with brilliant brittleness by Eleanor Tomlinson), even before he was embittered by being paralysed in a drunken car accident \u2013 flesh out and strengthen Christie\u2019s characters, whom she was frequently happy to leave as ciphers in the puzzle she was laying out to solve. The latest adaptations, rich, dark, adult and drawing on a backdrop of postwar grief and instability, are a far cry from the sunny \u2013 still murderous, but sunny \u2013 uplands scattered with millet seed for Joan Hickson to peck at as Miss Marple or the light-filled art deco apartments in which the leetle grey cells of David Suchet\u2019s Poirot could do their work. The audience\u2019s innocence has been too battered by the ordeals of the past few years, perhaps, for them to pass muster now. We get the Agatha Christie adaptations, we need, it seems \u2013 and, in the last three outings at least, better than we deserve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
