More than 80,000 responses have been received for 18,000 seasonal positions at Royal Mail sorting offices \u2013 up from 70,000 applicants last year. The company has been deluged with CVs since advertising for stop-gap workers to support the 130,000 postmen and women delivering the 2bn packages, cards and letters that clog mailbags in the run-up to Christmas. A Communication Workers Union spokeswoman said: \"Unemployment levels are awful right now and we're not at all surprised that 80,000 people have applied for the Christmas vacancies.\" However, she added that the posts would only bring temporary relief to those seeking work because the short-term contracts will run from mid-November to January. \"These Christmas jobs \u2013 while bringing some short-term cash to families \u2013 won't solve the unemployment problems of the country as the jobs will end early in the new year,\" she said. The seasonal peaks in the postal market mean the state-owned Royal Mail does not require more full-time staff. The busiest day for the postal system is expected to be Monday 12 December when 130m items will be sent, more than twice the average. However, the positions will represent a short-term reversal of an employment trend that saw the loss of 111,000 public sector jobs in the three months to June, against 41,000 created in other parts of the economy. Scott Corfe, senior economist at the Centre for Economic and Business Research, said the scramble for part-time jobs was unlikely to abate soon. \"The unemployment situation is going to remain pretty tight for the next three years. Job-shedding in the public sector has occurred at a much faster rate than has been predicted, and job creation in the private sector has not been fast enough to offset it. So we expect unemployment to stay elevated.\" Royal Mail's head of operations, Mark Higson, said the organisation was \"delighted\" with the response. \"Christmas is the busiest time of the year for Royal Mail. We are delighted at the response from people keen to earn extra money over the festive season. \"We look forward to receiving applications from people who want to earn some extra money and help us sort the Christmas mailbag of around 2bn items.\" More than half of the 18,000 vacancies have already been filled. Sorting offices in the Midlands are taking on the most posts, hiring 3,000 staff, with 2,000 being hired in Scotland, 1,000 in Wales and 400 in Northern Ireland. Corfe added that the high proportion of house ownership in the UK would make it difficult for people to relocate for part-time or full-time jobs. For those who do secure the posts, mid-December will be the busiest time for sorting offices. The last postal dates are 22 December for special deliveries, 20 December for first-class mail and 17 December for second class, with a deadline of 12 December for mail to Europe. The Royal Mail's advice to customers, aside from the usual exhortations to get those cards written early, includes a list of unusual items that will not be accepted by mail services abroad: toothpicks in Nigeria; sugar in Italy; and ravioli in Holland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
