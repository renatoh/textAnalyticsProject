Studies had shown that the tax, introduced in January 2014, had started to curb soda consumption in a country confronting crises of childhood obesity and diabetes. The finance commission in the lower house of Congress approved halving the tax on sweetened drinks if the sugar content is less than five grams per 100 millilitres \u2013 an incentive for beverage producers to offer more low-calorie options, according to lawmakers with the right-leaning National Action Party (PAN). But public health groups and some opposition politicians accused lawmakers of caving to pressure from drinks manufacturers and taking an incorrect approach to lowering calorie consumption. \u201cThis measure weakens the tax and could weaken its effects,\u201d said Dr Juan Rivera Dommarco, adjunct director of nutrition and health in Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Public Health (INSP). \u201cThe way to safeguard public health is to increase the tax \u2026 then reduce it on the products that have less sugar.\u201d In January 2014, Mexico slapped a tax of one peso (six cents) per litre on sugary drinks, increasing the price of sodas by about 10%. It also applied a tax on high-calorie snacks like cookies and crisps. The tax on sugary drinks has been held up as an example for other countries to follow, especially as diseases like diabetes and obesity boom in the developed and developing world alike. Preliminary results from a study on the tax by researchers at INSP and the University of North Carolina showed a 6% reduction in soda consumption during 2014, with the rate increasing as the year progressed. Mexicans guzzle more than 43 gallons of soda per person per year, according to the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, while a preference for low-calorie versions of soft drink standbys has never taken hold. Rivera attributed the thirst for soda to trends such as Mexicans weaning babies on soft drinks. And while potable water is not available in many parts of the country, soft drink bottlers operate networks delivering their products to the most remote and insecure corners of the country. Advertising is also intense, with companies like Coca-Cola sponsoring Christmas trees in public squares across the country, covered with ornamental logos. Mexico\u2019s soft drink makers\u2019 association, ANPRAC, disputes the impact of the tax and drop in consumption. It says instead sales have slid 2.5% since the tax was applied and 1,700 jobs have been lost. It estimates the tax lowered caloric consumption by 6.2 calories per day. Sugary drinks account for an estimated 35% of sales in the country\u2019s ubiquitous corner stores, according the National Association of Small Merchants (ANPEC), which accused the federal government of taxing soda to extract money from the nearly 60% of the population in the informal economy. ANPEC president Cuauht\u00e9moc Rivera said bottlers began selling more soda in returnable containers as a way to offset the cost of the new tax and consumption levels seem to have stabilized. He also noted: \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that the money being collected is going toward fighting obesity.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how many brands the new tax treatment would apply to as sales of low-calorie and artificially sweetened sodas are lower in Mexico than other countries. \u201cThey\u2019re small changes that basically benefit the companies,\u201d lawmaker Vidal Llerenas of the leftwing party Morena told online news outlet Sin Embargo. \u201cBasically, there was pressure from the private sector to push some modifications such as this to be able to reduce the tax.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
