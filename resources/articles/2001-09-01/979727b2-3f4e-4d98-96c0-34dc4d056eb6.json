She dreams of living like a real family - with a man, a baby, a sofa and a copy of the Radio Times. Instead she gets by in a Sheffield council flat furnished with a TV, a beanbag and a bed. Desperate and desperately needy, she wants to be loved, but ends up being used and abused and colluding in her inevitable slide towards depression, mental disintegration, violence and crack addiction. She's already had one baby - the result of an underage liaison with one of her teachers - and now she's pregnant again, much to the disgust of her gran, who brought her up and wanted better for her, and the relief of her 34-year-old boyfriend Dave, who feared he might be infertile. What Dave doesn't know is that he almost certainly isn't the father - and Lucy has no intention of telling him. Leo Butler first came to attention with Made of Stone at last year's Royal Court young writers' festival. His first full-length play still feels like the work of a very young man, and laying it out thinly across the Royal Court's main stage does not help. This is a small, observational, \"stuff happens\" drama, inflated by Dominic Cooke's slick, eye-catching production and made exceptionally watchable by Lyndsey Marshal, who manages to capture Lucy's mixture of vulnerability and manipulation, innocence and knowingness. Lucy's lack of grip on reality - she would rather play Cluedo than engage with real life - is matched by many of those around her. Her sister Nikki thinks that babies are really cute until she gets landed with one. Dave's talk of being a dad and finding a job is just talk - he's too busy smoking crack to paint the flat. Butler writes with an acute ear for the cadences of everyday speech, and shapes the narrative with impressive skill. But he tells you nothing that you haven't heard before: some people's lives are desperate and awful, some women will do anything to feel loved, and men are either useless or bastards, and sometimes both. \u0095 Until October 6.
