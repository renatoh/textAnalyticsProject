I can finally stop doing my kids' homework", "bodyText": "\u201cIt is important,\u201d said an email from the headteacher of the secondary school my eldest attends, \u201cto maintain the distinction of the holidays.\u201d I have never agreed more with any human being. Thanks to Easter, homeschooling is out for two weeks, which means living the same life, only with less guilt and fewer arguments at 10am over whether 9am is a good time to start. Damn right, this is an important distinction. I have solicited expert views on how to homeschool. I have also waxed philosophical about whether or not this is a good time to set your family free from the constraints of formal education and teach them other stuff instead, our own special skills such as how to make Korean-style whipped iced coffee (which they are brilliant at) or how to find something in a drawer. But my lived reality is neither of these things. Instead, it\u2019s an unedifying cycle, where I badger them to at least get their homework out, hassle them into telling me what it is, and then end up doing it for them. The 10-year-old had to write a letter to Boris Johnson, telling him how coronavirus made her feel. She found this inherently droll, given that he actually had it. Like, you would never do that with any other disease. \u201cDear person with tuberculosis, I want to tell you a little bit about how tuberculosis, which I don\u2019t have, makes me feel.\u201d I said: \u201cGive them a break, they might have set this before he was diagnosed. Anyway, how does it make you feel?\u201d \u201cNothing. I don\u2019t have any feelings about coronavirus.\u201d \u201cHow do you feel about being off school?\u201d \u201cGreat.\u201d \u201cReally? All the time? What about missing your friends?\u201d \u201cYes, I miss my friends.\u201d OK \u2026 \u201cDear Boris Johnson, I write to you with some ambivalence about the situation facing the nation. On the one hand, it\u2019s great being off school. On the other, I miss my friends \u2026\u201d \u201cHow long does this have to be?\u201d \u201cLonger than that. That\u2019s more of a postcard.\u201d This is my special skill, making things longer. This is the work I was born to do. I could do a paragraph wishing him well, and asking about his symptoms. I could tell him about the pets in the household. Frankly, I was on fire, we had a serviceable letter in 10 minutes flat and the only problem was that I\u2019d written it. Next she had to analyse a piece of graffiti: \u201cThe people save the people / NHS staff, you are our pride.\u201d What did she think it meant? What slogan would she spray paint on to a wall to show her appreciation for the NHS? \u201cThanks?\u201d \u201cThink you\u2019d have to be a bit more specific, like: \u2018Doctors, thanks!\u2019\u201d We agreed that nurses shouldn\u2019t be left out. Then, that we would need some way to get their attention, and landed on: \u201cOi, nurses and doctors, thanks!\u201d If I had just butted out, and it had been that lame, it would have been fine. But I had basically done it, and it was still that lame. Then I went to harass the 12-year-old, who was answering questions about a speech in Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, which he claimed not to understand one word of. Oberon had just \u201cforgiven\u201d Titania \u2013 why had I put forgiveness in inverted commas, he wanted to know? Well, because it\u2019s pretty gaslighty, drugging someone to fall in love, then being enraged by their infidelity. So I would call forgiveness quite a moot concept. It turned out feminist revisionism was definitely not what he wanted. \u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked. \u201cBECAUSE THAT\u2019S NOT WHAT THEY\u2019VE ASKED FOR. LITERALLY NOWHERE ON THIS SHEET DOES IT SAY: \u2018WHAT WOULD A FEMINIST THINK OF OBERON?\u2019.\u201d The question, rather, was: \u201cWhat do Oberon and Titania do next?\u201d, relating to the line: \u201cSound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me / And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI guess it could mean dancing, given the music. Or it could mean having sex. That\u2019s what people usually mean when they talk about the earth moving.\u201d \u201cThere is no way they are looking for the answer \u2018Having sex\u2019. I don\u2019t think you even understand what homework is.\u201d \u201cWell, you could put it more formally, like: \u2018Dancing, or something a bit more marital.\u2019\u201d My attention then wandered for two seconds, and I turned round to find what he had actually written was: \u201cThey could be dancing, or doing something different.\u201d \u201cBut \u2026 \u2018something different\u2019 could be anything. It could be taking the dog for a walk. It\u2019s like saying: \u2018I have no idea what they do next. They could be doing any of an infinite number of different things.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got a great idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go away, and do something different, and when you come back, neither of us will remember anything about this conversation.\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d I said, \u201care you trying to bewitch me?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
