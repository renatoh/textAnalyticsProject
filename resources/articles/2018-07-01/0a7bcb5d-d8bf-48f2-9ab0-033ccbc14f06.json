The correct answer, of course, is not only that it could but that it is happening right now. Yes, some of the more horrific aspects of the Trump presidency \u2013 the alleged collusion with Russian forces, for example \u2013 are absent, but from a policy sense there is little that would see Turnbull wishing to be separate from Trump. Tax cuts that favour the wealthy? Hell yes. The Turnbull government\u2019s key economic policy has been to bring in tax cuts which when fully completed will overwhelmingly favour the wealthy and which will exacerbate income inequality. Tax cuts for corporations? Yes please! While the Turnbull government has been unable to get the bulk of its company tax cuts through, there are few doubts that they won\u2019t occur. Pauline Hanson is expected to give the government her support once the Longman byelection is out of the way and she doesn\u2019t have to explain to voters why she supported a policy most of them do not. A willingness to hit the racial dog-whistle? Why certainly. The signs are already here that the next election is going to be a horror show of talk about migrants and crime and blaming immigration for everything from wages to housing prices to congestion, and all coated with a very thin veneer of racial anxiety. Trump has spent much of the past year talking up fears of the MS-13 gangs to such an extent that despite no evidence of any growing activity, 85% of those who voted for Trump now believe the gang is a very serious or a somewhat serious \u201cnational threat\u201d. For Malcolm Turnbull and his government, substitute MS-13 for \u201cAfrican gangs\u201d in Melbourne. Last week on 3AW Turnbull responded to Neil Mitchell\u2019s question of whether he believed \u201cpeople in Melbourne are frightened to go to restaurants because of Sudanese gangs?\u201d by saying, \u201cWell I\u2019ve heard that from people in Melbourne and Neil you\u2019re a person in Melbourne. Well I\u2019ve heard it, I\u2019ve heard people, colleagues from Melbourne say that there is a real anxiety about crime in Melbourne. It is a real issue.\u201d There was a time Turnbull might have been expected to take a stand against such fear-mongering. A time when \u201cheard it from people\u201d would not within a sentence turn into \u201ca real issue\u201d. But those days are long gone. He might not be as vulgar as Trump, but Turnbull is just as willing to appeal to the lowest common denominator. And what about thin-skinned responses to criticism? The ongoing attempts from the Turnbull government to discredit the ABC is only marginally less subtle than Trump\u2019s railing against the \u201cfake media\u201d. The Turnbull government is not content to merely seek to have the ABC remove content it finds displeasing. This week the health department sought to have the parliamentary library take down a post which highlighted just how weak are the privacy provisions surrounding the My Health Record. I suspect that censoring those who are pointing out reasons the public should not trust a government service is not the best way to have the public believe they can trust that service \u2013 or their government. And finally, how about a preference for big business? As we have seen with the company tax cuts that is certainly evident, but a perfect example of where the Turnbull government\u2019s priorities lie came this week with the announcement of Nine taking over Fairfax. The deal is a terrible one for those who value a diverse media. I suggested on Twitter that talk the new company would have \u201cplenty of Fairfax DNA\u201d was like saying the Brisbane Lions have plenty of Fitzroy DNA. But as a few people pointed out to me, at least Brisbane kept the \u201cLion\u201d name and also makes an effort to keep the Fitzroy legacy alive as best it can. That the new company couldn\u2019t even be bothered keeping \u201cFairfax\u201d in a manner similar to \u201cSeven West Media\u201d or \u201cTime Warner\u201d shows how little care there is about what Fairfax represents, and does not bode well. You can blame the Fairfax management \u2013 and it sure as heck deserves plenty \u2013 but this takeover would not have occurred had the Turnbull government not removed the cross-media ownership laws last year. That legislation \u2013 made possible with the support of One Nation, Nick Xenophon and Derryn Hinch \u2013 was designed to provoke such takeovers. It is not about competition in the free market, it is not about greater diversity of media voices or giving media companies a better ability to hold governments and corporations to account. It is about \u2013 as is inevitably all pro-business legislation \u2013 ensuring consolidation of power in the market. In defending the legislation this week Turnbull stated that \u201call the media companies strongly supported these laws\u201d. It was a view parroted by the communications minister, Mitch Fifeld, justifying the legislation because it was supported by \u201cNine, Seven, Ten, WIN, Prime, Southern Cross Austereo, News Limited, Fairfax, Free TV, Commercial Radio Australia and Fox\u201d. Yes, companies wanting to buy other companies and companies wanting to be bought by other companies liked the legislation. I am shocked. It does highlight how the government will default to doing what business wants rather than what might be best for workers, or in this case our democratic society. If business says it is what is needed, well then that is what is supplied, and that is how it is justified. It all makes for a pretty awful mix. And while those in the US are wondering whether the changes wrought by the Trump presidency can ever be undone, here too the impact of the Turnbull government will be long lived.
