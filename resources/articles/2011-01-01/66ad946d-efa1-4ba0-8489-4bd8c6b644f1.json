They made it nine, despite outscoring Bath by three tries to one and leading for all but four minutes of a match that was decided by Olly Barkley's boot with the final kick. Both sides went into the new year looking to become reacquainted with victory. Bath's previous success in the Premiership had come in September, Irish's the following month. Bath had managed only one try in their five previous league matches, one reason why they had struggled to retain the lead as well as play catch-up. They were behind after only 100 seconds yesterday, punishment for a sloppy start. Butch James crabbed across the field and had virtually bumped into Shontayne Hape before trying to offload a pass. The ball fell loose, Dan Bowden hacked on, and when Sailosi Tagicakibau received it on Bath's 22 he should have met more resistance than Jack Cuthbert's attempted tackle, which saw the wing speed up rather than slow down on his way to the line. Chris Malone extended the lead to 10 points with a penalty after eight minutes, and the outside-half, preferred in the last three matches to the more adventurous Ryan Lamb, symbolises Irish's back-to-basics approach: on the occasions he passes the ball, he favours short inside passes rather than cut-outs and long floaters, but kicking is his forte and he provided the Bath full-back, Jack Cuthbert, with a liberal supply of the ball. Not that Cuthbert made much use of it, once blowing a three-man overlap by keeping the ball and then losing control of it. Bath have played some of the Premiership's most expansive rugby in recent seasons, but when they eventually scored a try it came after 10 minutes of hammering and banging by the forwards with not a two-pass movement to be seen. Irish had been hanging on to their 17-9 interval lead with some comfort. Their second try, after 39 minutes, came after a moment of inspiration. George Stowers faced one way and passed the other, allowing Elvis Seveali'i and Delon Armitage the space to free the flanker Richard Thorpe. Bath kept in touch with three Barkley penalties and Irish paid for their growing indiscipline when Thorpe was sent to the sin-bin for collapsing a maul. The visitors bashed away, Lewis Moody, Michael Claassens and Luke Watson all held up before Moody broke from a scrum and Claassens squirmed his way over. Thorpe was waiting to come back on when Steffon Armitage conceded a penalty just inside his own half and Barkley gave Bath the lead for the first time. It did not last long. The Irish replacement Seilala Mapusua provided the decoy from a scrum as Topsy Ojo burst into the midfield, but Barkley's weak tackle showed why he is no longer in the England squad. A fifth penalty from the centre gave the Bath forwards hope. They mauled their way back into the Irish 22 and Steffon Armitage was blown for collapsing in front of his own posts 20 metres out. Redemption for Barkley but Irish deserved better."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
