In 2012, he made a three-part retrospective, Attenborough: 60 Years in the Wild, in which the veteran TV presenter looked back on his long and illustrious career. Tall, pencil-thin, and wearing his trademark braces \u2013 never a fashion statement, but simply to stop his trousers falling down \u2013 Miles, who has died aged 61 from a rare lung disease, was a familiar and well-loved figure in the close-knit world of natural history broadcasting. He spent virtually the whole of his 35-year career at the BBC Natural History Unit in Bristol, working on some of its most popular programmes, including The Life of Birds, Blue Planet II and the Emmy-award-winning Frozen Planet. He helped to ensure that the unit\u2019s output was always of a very high standard, contributing to its worldwide success. Miles\u2019s fascination with wildlife began at a young age. He kept a menagerie of several hundred snakes, lizards and rodents, which frequently escaped, terrorising his family and unwary visitors to their suburban home. At the age of 12, he returned from a holiday in the US with a gerbil secreted in his hand luggage. Caught red-handed by a customs officer, he was waved through with a conspiratorial wink. His sister Amanda describes their domestic life as \u201clike My Family and Other Animals \u2013 only in Essex rather than Corfu\u201d. Miles was born in London, the third of four siblings, and raised in Woodford Green, Essex (now part of Greater London). His father, Don, was a quantity surveyor. His mother, Jean (nee Leonard), was a secretary, who gave up work to raise the family until her early death, just before Miles\u2019s 21st birthday. He attended Forest school, on the edge of Epping Forest, where he got involved in drama, and went on to study animal science at the University of Nottingham, graduating in 1980. He then began a PhD on calf behaviour at Reading University where, as a \u201clanky Essex boy with glasses\u201d he stood out among his fellow students, who were mostly from rural farming backgrounds. He also pursued his other passion, taking plays to the Edinburgh fringe. Abandoning his PhD, he got a job as a BBC radio producer in London, where he made science and medical programmes. In the mid-1980s he moved to the Natural History Unit, where he met his future wife, Alex Hulm. They married in 1994, and he became stepfather to her son, Matthew. A daughter, Lois, was born in 1996. In the mid-90s, Miles began his longstanding partnership with Attenborough, producing three episodes of The Life of Birds, broadcast in 1998. He then became series producer on Wild New World (2002), featuring North America\u2019s prehistoric wildlife, followed by Journey of Life (2005), telling the story of evolution. Both series used pioneering computer graphics to recreate sequences that would otherwise have been impossible to show. He also produced the first episode of Springwatch, shown before the main series in early 2005. Miles always wanted to return to working with Attenborough, and that year he embarked on the series that would be the high point of his distinguished career. Broadcast in 2008, Life in Cold Blood was the ninth and final part of Attenborough\u2019s \u201cLife\u201d project, and the last major series Attenborough presented on location. For Miles, this was the culmination of a lifelong ambition to make a series about reptiles and amphibians. Even though these creatures are not considered such good \u201cbox office\u201d as birds and mammals, it was a major success, winning Wildscreen\u2019s Golden Panda award, as well as the Bafta for best specialist factual series. Miles then returned to his first love, making programmes on location, on landmark series such as Frozen Planet (2011). In one \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d sequence, he had a memorable encounter with a polar bear family, when a female with cubs almost jumped into his boat. Miles was so busy looking at the camera monitor he only realised afterwards just how close they had been. Miles\u2019s last major project was the 2018 series Dynasties, for which he made two episodes: Tiger and Emperor, about emperor penguins. His experience was crucial in fulfilling the brief of filming a single animal family or group across several years, in what was one of the most ambitious wildlife series to date. Towards the end of his career, he took on a new role, as deputy to the Natural History Unit\u2019s creative director Mike Gunton. He became a valued father figure to a new generation of up-and-coming producers, generously giving them the benefit of his knowledge and experience, while expecting very high standards in return. While many of his peers chose to leave the BBC, to embark on careers in independent TV production, Miles was always fiercely loyal to the NHU, though this never stopped him from speaking out if he felt senior management were in the wrong. In the words of one longstanding colleague, \u201cMiles was always honest, decent, supportive and straightforward \u2013 one of the good guys\u201d. That sentiment was endorsed by Attenborough, who described him as \u201castonishingly modest, with a great sense of humour and, above all, incredibly calm \u2013 he never panicked about anything\u201d. Miles is survived by Alex, Matthew and Lois, his brother, Warwick, two sisters, Amanda and Melanie, his stepmother, Gill, and his father. \u2022 Miles Barton, wildlife TV producer, born 20 July 1959; died 24 November 2020"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
