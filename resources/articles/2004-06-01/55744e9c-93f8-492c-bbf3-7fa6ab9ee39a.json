A test event for the 2004 Olympics might have been a trial run for 2008, such was the volume of noise from the Chinese supporters who filled half of the city's aquatics centre. The reason was the appearance of Tian Liang and Guo Jingjing, perhaps the most famous names in the sport, let alone China, where they have starred in a TV commercial performing a scene from Romeo and Juliet. Not that a romance between the pair has been confirmed. The strict methods of training in China do not allow much time for anything except preparing for an Olympics where Tian will be defending his 10-metre platform title and Guo will be aiming to improve on the two silver medals she won in the Sydney Olympics. Both were thrust into diving at an early age. Tian, 24, was fourth in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 having dived since he was seven. As he progressed to win gold in Sydney, one of his efforts achieved the highest single-dive mark in Olympic history. Guo, 22, joined the national team when she was 11. Along with the two silver medals in Sydney she has become a world champion and has enjoyed the attendant financial gains. \"Sport is an industry now. It's an example of how economic reforms have changed in China,\" she said recently. Only one industry will matter in Athens. China won eight gold medals in Sydney and, after criticism from former divers about a lack of discipline, the spotlight will be on them. Not that it is ever off the golden couple."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
