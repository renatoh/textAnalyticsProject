Up to three years ago, he was still involved in political activity, working for the Labour Committee for Europe. When, in 1945, Jim became organiser and secretary for the Birmingham Labour party, his first task was to revive the 13 constituency parties that had remained largely dormant with the wartime electoral truce. His next task was to find 13 prospective candidates to fight that July's general election. During the next four decades, he was to be essentially a power behind Labour's throne, helping to produce electoral victories. At the time of that wartime election, there were a bevy of army officers - among them Major Woodrow Wyatt, Captain Roy Jenkins and Captain Raymond Blackburn - all hoping to be selected. Jim also had to deal with Clement Attlee when the party leader went to Birmingham for an open-air rally. Jim told the future prime minister that he had been allocated an hour to speak to the electors. \"If anyone has anything to say,\" Attlee replied briskly, \"they can say it in 20 minutes.\" With Jim's brilliant organisation skills, Labour won 10 of the 13 seats - all gains from the Conservatives. Following his success in Birmingham, in 1947 Jim was appointed assistant regional organiser for London, where, because of the housing shortage, he found himself sharing accommodation with Roy Jenkins. Five years later, he left the capital to become east Midlands regional organiser, a post he held until 1972. This was a time when regional Labour party organisers played a key role in the selection of candidates, suggesting names to local parties and using their influence to avoid the selection of those they considered unsuitable candidates. Many candidates who eventually found a seat at Westminster can thank Jim for his practical support. In 1972 Jim became director of the Labour Committee for Europe, whose primary task was to persuade the Labour and trade union movements to support Britain's 1973 entry into the EEC. He played a key role in organising the \"yes\" vote in the 1975 referendum when the Labour prime minister Harold Wilson asked the country to approve Britain's continued membership. He also served on Nottinghamshire county council for four years. Born and brought up in Coventry, he was the son of an active trade unionist father, whose employment suffered as a result of his beliefs. This meant that instead of staying on at King Edward VI grammar school, Birmingham, Jim had to find work to supplement the family income. In 1931, while working at a smelting firm, he became active in the Labour party. Forty years on, during the party turmoil of the 1970s and 80s, Jim could see that all the gains Labour had achieved were falling apart, and leading to the demise of social democracy and the emergence of Thatcherism. Although a close friend of Roy Jenkins, he decided not to follow those who formed the SDP, remaining instead neither \"old\" nor \"new\" Labour - just plain Labour. Outside politics, he was proud of his garden and the vegetables it produced, and was active in the National Liberal Club in London, where he served on the all-important wine committee. He enjoyed the countryside and supported the activities of wildlife charities, particularly the Norfolk Naturalists Trust. He is survived by his second wife, Joan Mitchell, their children Nick and Jackie, and the children of his first marriage, Philip and Roy. \u00b7 James Cattermole, political organiser, born December 11 1910; died January 11 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
