We saw what we wanted to see in the adverts. A really fantastic indoor wave pool with slides! Organised games for kids, pony trekking, archery, rambles on the sandy cliffs! The holiday camp in Wales seemed to tick all the boxes and, best of all, was amazingly affordable. We arrived and started to explore. Along the main street of the 'holiday village', both bookies were open and Tannoys were blaring the race results to blank-eyed men sitting on benches outside, sipping at cans of Special Brew. The Spar offered a selection of beans, white sliced bread, and lager on its half-empty shelves. The food court held a selection of kebab, burger and pizza counters. At 4pm the tattooed holidaymakers lined up Staten-Island style to claim their accommodation. Most popular were the chalets closest to the village, a series of low-rise maisonettes reminiscent of 1960s inner-city low-cost housing. The mobile home we opted for represented a wholly superior form of discomfort. It was on the perimeter of the camp, in a grassy area by a barbed wire fence and a padlocked gate. The telly was chained to the wall. We unpacked and, to raise everyone's spirits, decided to have tea and toast. The fireball of ancient grease that the cooker grill spat out fortunately did not ignite anything in the tiny kitchen. The kids were beginning to get tetchy, so clearly it was time to get out there and get active. Archery? Not doing it this season. Pony riding? Ponies were off. Seaside ramble? A barbed-wire fence stood between camp and coastline. Change for the slot machines, then? Nope. The indoor wave pool heaved with small unsupervised boys and within 10 minutes ours had his first black eye. On the plus side, there was a snooker table to each guest, in an echoing hangar the other side of the amusement arcade. That night we lay awake shivering, and not just from cold. In the small hours, our vigil was joined by a drunk and disoriented Scouser who blundered around outside, rattling the padlocked gate and wailing for his home like a lost soul. We escaped in the morning. The holiday camp shut down later that year. Have you had a crap holiday? If so, tell us about it.
