The TUC issued a report criticising Amazon\u2019s employment practices on Monday, the eve of Prime Day \u2013 an annual event when the online retailer offers deals but that unions have said pushes hardworking staff to their limit and beyond. In a joint statement with the GMB union, the TUC called on the government to improve workers\u2019 conditions through an upcoming employment bill but also to force Amazon\u2019s hand by using its powers as a client of the company. Amazon has won \u00a323m in state-funded work since the pandemic started, including \u00a38.3m related to the beleaguered NHS test and trace app, taking the total value of its UK government contracts since 2015 to \u00a3630m. A spokesperson for Amazon said it was working with government to deliver testing kits rather than a test and trace service, adding: \u201cWe are continuing to work closely with the government on this service, have delivered more than 3m Covid-19 testing kits and to date, we have waived all fees and charges for this service.\u201d The TUC and GMB said these contracts \u2013 calculated by the specialist procurement organisation Tussell \u2013 meant ministers could force the company to improve conditions for workers. They said workers have described gruelling conditions, unrealistic productivity targets, surveillance, bogus self-employment and a refusal to recognise or engage with unions unless forced. Ambulances were called out 600 times to 14 Amazon warehouses in Britain between 2015 and 2018, which the GMB said was because workers were collapsing in unsafe, intense working conditions. \u201cIf ministers are serious about improving lives they must help level up working conditions at places like Amazon,\u201d said the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cAmazon workers have played a key role during this pandemic. But many are treated like disposable labour. That is not right. \u201cPublic contracts should not reward bad working practices.\u201d She said the government also had a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to strengthen labour rights and improve pay in the upcoming employment bill. The TUC want the bill to include: Better union access to workplaces. The banning of zero hours contracts. Stronger laws to protect supply chain workers. Ending \u201cbogus\u201d self-employment. The TUC is holding an event on Monday entitled Challenging Amazon, discussing ways to address perceived injustices suffered by Amazon workers. The GMB\u2019s Mick Rix said: \u201cThis report is a warning to the public sector that it can no longer turn a blind eye to Amazon\u2019s exploitative practices and appalling health and safety record. \u201cIt\u2019s time for UK government and safety regulators to either tell Amazon\u2019s management to put their house in order or send them packing.\u201d Trade unions across Europe recently clashed with Amazon after it posted a recruitment advert for staff whose job description involved keeping tabs on organised labour. In the US, Amazon came under pressure after revealing that almost 20,000 of its workers in the US have contracted Covid-19 after months of demands for public disclosure from activists. It has not published similar figures in the UK, where deliveries have continued and even increased during the pandemic as homebound shoppers turned to online retail. The firm recently announced that it would create 7,000 jobs in the UK to meet increased demand of warehouse and distribution jobs. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said: \u201cThe government will not tolerate the exploitation of vulnerable workers for commercial gain. \u201cWe have committed to establishing a single enforcement body for employment rights to provide a clearer route for workers to raise a complain and get support, while providing a consistent approach to enforcement.\u201d A spokesperson for Amazon said: \u201cOver the last 10 years we\u2019ve invested more than \u00a323bn in the UK, and this year we announced plans to create another 10,000 new jobs by the end of 2020, taking our total UK workforce to over 40,000. \u201cAmazon is a safe place to work. Yet again, our critics seem determined to paint a false picture of what it\u2019s like to work for Amazon. They repeat the same sensationalised allegations time and time again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
