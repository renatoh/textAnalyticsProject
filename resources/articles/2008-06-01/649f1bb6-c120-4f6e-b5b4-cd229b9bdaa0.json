If it hasn't solved some of the mysteries about Katharine's relationships with her husband, Captain William O'Shea (pronounced O'Shee, we are told), and Parnell - and it has not! - no one else is likely to get any closer to doing so. Charles Stewart Parnell was a strange, and to most people remote, man; the word used to describe the principal characteristic of this Wicklow landowner was \"hauteur\". Much of the mystique that surrounded him derived from this remoteness from everyone around him - except, of course, Katharine O'Shea, the youngest daughter of a baronet clergyman, Sir John Wood, who had been chamberlain to George IV's divorced Queen, Caroline. Brought up in rural Essex, Katharine is described by Elisabeth Kehoe as \"an attractive young woman, although perhaps not beautiful. Her features were on the heavy side, but her assets were 'thick curling hair' and a 'lovely English-rose complexion'\". Her wit and self-confidence were very much in evidence, and she was sociable and outgoing. A year after her father's death when she was 21, she married Captain William O'Shea, an impecunious member of an Irish family which may have lost its land through the earlier operation of the penal laws against Catholics. For most of his period as leader of the Irish Parliamentary party in the 1880s, the affair that Parnell carried on with Katharine O'Shea may actually have added to his mystique by keeping him remote from his parliamentary colleagues. But at the same time it also came to weaken their ties and, ultimately, fatally undermine their loyalty to him. Many of the puzzles that still surround his career as party leader - relate to the question of how much key party colleagues, and the Liberal leadership, including Gladstone, knew of the O'Shea affair - and at what point they came to suspect, or later to know, that it was happening. These are difficult questions to answer, all the more so because it suited many of those concerned not to know about it - or at least not to be known to know about it. Because for a period Katharine played a significant role in communications between Parnell and Gladstone as prime minister, the question of how much, and when, the latter knew of the affair is politically important - and it is an issue that was complicated by the character of the PM, who genuinely had difficulty in believing ill of anyone. Even more tantalising is the question of when Captain O'Shea came first to suspect, and then to know of, his wife's affair with Parnell. A complication in all this was the dependence of both the O'Sheas on Katharine's rich Aunt Ben - which extended ultimately also to the impecunious Parnell, who lived much of the time with Katharine in houses paid for by her aunt. Because of Aunt Ben, all three of this strange trio had a huge interest in keeping the affair secret throughout the 1880s. It began in the autumn of 1880, when Parnell started staying in her house in Eltham, about eight miles southeast of Westminster: O'Shea, by then MP for Clare, usually lived in bachelor quarters in London. In July 1881 O'Shea challenged his leader to a duel to be held in France, but this row was patched up by Katharine's sister Anna, and an uneasy peace followed. O'Shea may initially have believed that the two girls born to Katharine in 1883 and 1884 were his, which would imply that, unknown to Parnell, Katharine continued her marital relationship during the early years of the affair. But later O'Shea accepted that Parnell was their father. And so it went on until Aunt Ben died in 1889, leaving Katharine her estate. O'Shea then joined with Katharine's family in challenging the will, as well as suing his wife for divorce. Parnell remained in denial about the whole matter, convincing Katharine as well as himself that all would be well, and refusing to defend the action. As a result, Kehoe says, \"lurid revelations were catastrophically left unchallenged\". None of the three emerged well from these events. There followed in quick succession the split in the Irish Parliamentary party, the marriage of the two lovers, and Parnell's death, at the age of 45. The enactment of home rule was delayed for over 20 years, and even then postponed because of the first world war. This led to the 1916 rising, the Irish war of independence and civil war, and the emergence of an Irish state, first as a dominion, then as a republic. And ever since Katharine O'Shea has received a very bad press. Without her, it would all have turned out differently. But how differently? We do not, cannot, know. All I can say is that the history of the rest of the 20th century suggests that home rule would not have been the right answer for Ireland, for it would have left the whole of the island hugely dependent financially on Britain - as Northern Ireland remains today. Without independence, and the power it has given Ireland to devise and implement policies capable of releasing the potential energies of its people, it is hard to see how it could ever have overtaken Britain to achieve one of the highest levels of output and income in modern Europe. If Katharine O'Shea's love for Parnell eventually diverted Ireland from the cul-de-sac of home rule and on to independence, maybe she wasn't quite as much of a misfortune for Ireland as the title of this excellent book suggests. \u00b7 Garret FitzGerald was taoiseach from 1981-82 and 1982-87.
