But since this is a panto for the over-18s, it isn\u2019t his nose that grows. \u201cThe minute we told people we were doing the show,\u201d says Jon Bradfield, who co-wrote Pinocchio: No Strings Attached!, \u201ceveryone said, \u2018I bet I can guess what happens when he lies.\u2019\u201d Bradfield and Martin Hooper\u2019s adult pantos have been a seasonal fixture for over a decade at London\u2019s Above the Stag theatre combining bushy-tailed innocence and gleeful filth in such shows as Jack Off the Beanstalk and Treasure Island: The Curse of the Pearl Necklace. Strip out the profanities and some of the gags in Pinocchio wouldn\u2019t sound out of place in mainstream panto, especially the increasingly near-the-knuckle Palladium spectacular, where last year Julian Clary informed audiences of all ages that he had woken that morning to eight inches (of snow, that is). So how does adult panto differ? \u201cThere are two things it allows you to do,\u201d says Bradfield. \u201cThe most obvious one is to be ruder.\u201d If some of the tension in family panto comes from pushing against the limits of good taste within the protective sheath of innuendo, it\u2019s different in the adult variety where anything goes. Here, as in X-rated animated movies such as Fritz the Cat or Jungle Burger, the thrill is in the contrast between child-friendly form and scabrous content. There are jokes in Pinocchio that are both ingenious and supremely disgusting, including one involving Panini football stickers and the phrase \u201cnut butter\u201d, but Bradfield is aiming for more than just the gross-out factor. \u201cWhat we try to do is make the romantic relationship in our shows more complicated than usual. So we\u2019ll have the two central characters be attracted to one another, then be pushed apart by internal forces.\u201d In the new show, this takes the form of Pinocchio\u2019s slow-dawning realisation that society disapproves of his love for a dishy footballer. \u201cYou can be more grownup about that than you could in a family panto,\u201d says Bradfield. \u201cIt\u2019s not standup. You\u2019ve got the audience there for over two hours, so you\u2019ve got to tell a story, and it\u2019s important that at the end people still go, \u2018Ahhh.\u2019\u201d Adult panto has blossomed into a lucrative industry since the mid-1990s, when Jim Davidson mounted Sinderella and paraded his Boobs in the Wood. Among the titles competing this year to be filthy for lucre are Dick Whittington and His Pussy, Merry Poppers and A Pissedmas Carol. Looking further afield for inspiration is Kevin Quinn, who has adapted Jane Austen into Pride and Prejudice: The Gay Panto. \u201cI thought it was going to be a lot harder,\u201d he says, displaying a firm grasp of the double entendre. \u201cBut 95% of the show is Austen\u2019s words and we\u2019ve just shifted some of the emphasis.\u201d That means turning Lady Catherine into a dominatrix and putting a saucy spin on a line assessing the shrubbery in a woman\u2019s garden. Most of the plum details, he says, were there for the seizing \u2013 such as Austen\u2019s mention of two locations that are now renowned as gaybourhoods. \u201cMr Bennet goes to find Lydia in Brighton of all places,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cAnd then he goes to make inquiries in Clapham. It\u2019s all in the book!\u201d The wet-shirt scene invented for Andrew Davies\u2019s TV adaptation also features in Quinn\u2019s version, though now Mr Darcy\u2019s garment is drenched in something other than water. A gay sensibility dominates adult panto but other brands are available, as demonstrated by the Market Theatre Company in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, which has spent more than 20 years producing shows so successful that they outlast panto season. The group\u2019s latest production, Peter Panties, is touring until March. Time Out has called them \u201clone heterosexual interlopers in the thoroughly gay world of adult panto\u201d \u2013 a description with which Glyn Doggett, the company manager, has no issue. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing out-and-out camp,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re touring regionally, so we want something that will appeal to the masses.\u201d The three-strong cast, including Pippa Johnson, take multiple parts. Some of the fun comes from the chaos as they scramble around to fill every role, some from the script\u2019s prurience. \u201cOne of my characters is Wendy, who\u2019s usually very prim and proper,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cBut in our version, she\u2019s absolutely sex mad and is after everyone.\u201d Bradfield believes there can be pitfalls for an adult panto that doesn\u2019t identify as LGBT. \u201cIn a non-queer adult one,\u201d he says, \u201cit might be a challenge not to stray into potentially homophobic or misogynistic humour. If the people who are making the crude sexual jokes, as we do, are already marginalised then that isn\u2019t such a risk. It\u2019s the old rule about not punching down.\u201d Jim Davidson\u2019s panto Boobs in the Wood featured comedy Asian accents and a hostile musical number called The Shirt-Lifters\u2019 Song. It\u2019s quite something to mock gayness from within one of the few genres in which it has historically enjoyed impunity. Davidson\u2019s last panto, Sinderella 2: Another Scottish Romp, closed mid-run in 2015 when he was accused of bullying theatre staff (which he denied) and sneaking off to the pub mid-performance (which he admitted). Johnson is confident that even as a non-camp \u201cheterosexual\u201d panto, Peter Panties is respectful to all its audience members. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re redoing shows from 10 years ago,\u201d she says, \u201cand there\u2019ll be lines or attitudes that aren\u2019t OK any more, so we change those. But as one of two women on stage, what I like is that it\u2019s usually us in control. I make a complete dick of myself and take the mickey out of the way women are often used as sex objects. I find that I\u2019m more annoyed by the traditional pantos than by anything in the adult ones. I mean, why does the woman always have to be rescued by the prince?\u201d Pinocchio: No Strings Attached is at Above the Stag theatre, London, until 11 January. Pride and Prejudice: The Gay Panto is at the White Bear, London, from 19 December to 4 January. Peter Panties is touring until March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
