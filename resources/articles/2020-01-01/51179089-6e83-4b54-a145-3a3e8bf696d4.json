Recently re-elected for a further four-year term, the controversial 57-year-old was in the capital for the launch of his TV channel, La Liga TV; but he had other things to say too, lots of them. La Liga, like the Premier League, is in competition for global eyeballs. It wants to grow its audience around the globe and get them to spend more time watching Spanish football year on year. Hence the new TV station launching in the UK one year after the collapse of Eleven Sports. As an administrator, however, Tebas has other concerns; the one that plagues him most being the proliferation of football competitions, the most problematic of those being Fifa\u2019s expanded Club World Cup, a 24-team competition set to be held in China in the summer of 2021. \u201cHaving been re-elected, I am very critical of the Club World Cup,\u201d Tebas says. \u201cAn organisation like Fifa is supposed to be a regulatory body. They draft the different calendars and when we need to play. Sadly, from organising World Cups, they are now talking about Club World Cups and having that every two years. That is not an option because it would change the status quo. This can\u2019t happen. \u201cA few weeks ago Fifa was talking about how much would be paid if they went to China. They have been talking about redistribution of revenue but haven\u2019t discussed the impact this would have in different countries. Let\u2019s imagine the two teams from Argentina [who will take part in the Club World Cup]. It\u2019s 40 or 50m from a tournament such as this. This would have an impact on the Argentinian Super League. They haven\u2019t looked at the consequences of these tournaments.\u201d The Club World Cup is not the only thing Tebas is critical of. His competition may be home to the two biggest clubs in world football, according to the latest Deloitte Money League, but Barcelona and Real Madrid are old money. The nouveau riche of Paris St-Germain and Manchester City are, meanwhile, a \u201cdanger\u201d to the game, \u201cstate run\u2026 playthings\u201d who \u201cskew the balance of the entire European football structure.\u201d This is what Tebas had said previously on the subject but in 2020 he takes a subtler line. \u201cOne of the major issues in European football is related to [financial] doping. Because when we have clubs being financed by states, then that has an impact on salaries,\u201d he says, with everyone knowing whom he is talking about. \u201cThat means in other countries with more strict economic controls like Spain and Germany clubs cannot actually ask the state for extra financing to pay those salaries. \u201cOrganisations and institutions have a responsibility to redistribute the wealth that we generate. All of us, the Spanish league, the Premier League, Uefa, Fifa. I don\u2019t think we are helping football in any way if we generate wealth and it just goes straight back to the big clubs. In the end instead of having 12 Ferraris, they have 15. We\u2019re dealing with major clubs generating a huge amount of money. So our aim is to redistribute that wealth.\u201d Tebas\u2019s argument for greater largesse among football\u2019s elite is new. Quite what the mechanism will be for it is unclear. He does, however, have positive noises for the Uefa chief executive, Alexander Ceferin, who has recently scaled back his own proposals for an expanded Champions League, in direct contrast to Gianni Infantino and Fifa. Perhaps he\u2019ll look to do something with him. Tebas is deeply conservative in his personal beliefs and has even endorsed the new Spanish far right party, Vox. He does not want change in the European sporting ecosystem. This is not just ideological, of course; it suits the interests of La Liga. So does pushing out its own TV channel, and perhaps its own Over The Top online service (live football on an app) in due course. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on the OTT now for several years\u201d, says Tebas. \u201cAnd the major advantage of OTT is knowing your users and their behaviour. \u201cWe have an OTT right now with \u2026 600,000 subscribers who watch everything from weightlifting to fencing. We\u2019re analysing their behaviour \u2026 and how to influence them so they continue watching different sports with us. I don\u2019t rule out the possibility of broadcasting football on that platform.\u201d Which, in the world of scheming sport administrators, is about as close as you\u2019ll get to a \u2018yes\u2019."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
