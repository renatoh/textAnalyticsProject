DNA tests are being conducted to determine whether the remains, found at the bottom of a two-metre pit covered with cement, belong to Shane Coates, 31, and Stephen Sugg, 27, from the \"Westies\" gang. They had been missing since 2004. \"From the size of the bodies, it is probable that is who they are,\" said an Alicante police spokesman, Alcerez Gallego. \"That is the hypothesis we're working with.\" The bodies were unearthed on Tuesday after Irish police received a tip-off from a member of a rival Irish gang. They were in an advanced state of decomposition. \"They were mostly bones,\" Lieutenant Gallego said. The men had reportedly been shot in the head at close range then dragged to the pit. A 36-year-old Irishman was arrested on Tuesday in connection with the find at his home near Torrevieja, another resort on the Costa Blanca. Lt Gallego said the man had rented the industrial warehouse where the bodies where found at the time the victims disappeared. Local reports said the Westies had tried to wrest control of drug trafficking operations from a rival gang, which had merged with former paramilitary members. It is thought Coates and Sugg were lured to the warehouse by the promise of a big drug deal, involving a 200kg (440lb) stash of cannabis, before being overwhelmed, tied up and shot. There have been a series of arrests in Spain of alleged members of the dissident republican Real IRA, who were said to have been smuggling tobacco to raise money for the organisation. Under the peace process, many gunmen retired from Ireland to the sun and sought the anonymity of holiday areas inhabited by foreigners. Some started new lives as drug lords and arms traffickers. When the gangsters' girlfriends reported their disappearance in 2004, police feared it could be a hoax intended to throw investigators and rival gangs off their track. The Garda commissioner in Dublin, Noel Conroy, confirmed the information that had led to the breakthrough came from Irish sources. \"We have garda\u00ed in Spain at the moment who brought information to the Spanish authorities,\" he said. The apparent discovery of Coates and Sugg has led the police to reopen the investigation into the disappearance of another Irish gangster, Sean Dunne. At the time he went missing, also in 2004, his father claimed he had been murdered and buried in plastic bags beneath cement at a housing complex in Rojales, Alicante. The Westies operated out of a suburb north-west of Dublin, and dominated the local heroin trade in the 1990s."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
