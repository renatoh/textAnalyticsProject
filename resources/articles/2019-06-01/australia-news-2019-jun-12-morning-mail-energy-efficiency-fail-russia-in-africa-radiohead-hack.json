Top stories Australia is missing an opportunity to easily meet its emissions targets through energy efficiency measures, new research has found. Australia could cut greenhouse gas emissions halfway to its Paris agreement target, and save $7.7bn a year in bills, by adopting existing global standards on household and business appliances such as hot-water heaters. The report, from the Energy Efficiency Council, found that adopting the measures used in Germany would save the average Australian household $790 a year on power bills and create 70,000 extra full-time equivalent jobs. Robots will not steal workers\u2019 jobs nor suppress pay, but fear of automation may be contributing to stagnant wages, according to Deloitte Access Economics. At the National Press Club on Wednesday, Deloitte partner Chris Richardson will argue that improving technology is shifting the mix of skills in demand with employers, but fears of mass unemployment are \u201centirely misplaced\u201d. In the speech, seen by Guardian Australia, Richardson says despite technological change accelerating for decades, unemployment is \u201cclose to record lows around the world\u201d. Russia is seeking to bolster its presence in at least 13 countries across Africa by building relations with existing rulers, striking military deals, and grooming a new generation of leaders and undercover agents, leaked documents have revealed. The mission to increase Russian influence on the continent is being led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman based in St Petersburg who is a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and whose troll factory, according to US special counsel Robert Mueller, ran an extensive social media campaign in 2016 to help elect Donald Trump. The leaked documents show the scale of recent Prigozhin-linked operations in Africa, and Moscow\u2019s ambition to turn the region into a strategic hub. World Carbon emissions from the global energy industry rose at the fastest rate in almost a decade in 2018 after surprise swings in global temperatures stoked extra demand for fossil fuels, helping to drive the world\u2019s biggest jump in gas consumption for more than 30 years and a second consecutive annual increase for coal use. High court judges in Botswana have ruled that laws criminalising same-sex relations are unconstitutional and should be struck down, in a major victory for gay rights campaigners in Africa. Boris Johnson recommended that the UK allow Saudi Arabia to buy British bomb parts expected to be deployed in Yemen, days after an airstrike on a factory in the country had killed 14 people in 2016. There were \u201cserious problems with the culture, morale and behaviour\u201d of Oxfam staff responding to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, according to a damning report, which has found that the charity failed to disclose allegations of child abuse. Radiohead have released a vast collection of unreleased tracks made during the sessions for 1997 album OK Computer, after a MiniDisc archive owned by frontman Thom Yorke was hacked last week by an unnamed person, who reportedly asked for a $150,000 ransom to return the recordings. Opinion and analysis Women who have abortions are only just now beginning to see themselves depicted on screen, but for a certain subgroup \u2013 women who are already mothers when they decide to terminate \u2013 the taboo is stronger than ever. But the second season of ABC TV\u2019s comedy-drama The Letdown is tackling it head-on. \u201cMothers have more abortions than anyone else,\u201d the show\u2019s co-creator Sarah Scheller says. \u201cAudrey\u2019s arc is about coming to a point where she doesn\u2019t feel shame about her decision.\u201d If renewables weren\u2019t getting cheaper, would Australia still want to tackle climate change? And if world demand for coal wasn\u2019t declining, would we still want to stop the Adani coalmine being built? After 30 years of democratic failures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in the past five technological leaps have succeeded where elections did not, writes Richard Denniss. But what does it say about Australia if we are only willing to save ourselves, and our kids, if we can get a good deal on the price of renewables? Sport In the women\u2019s World Cup, New Zealand came with two minutes of a draw against the Netherlands, only to have their hearts broken by the substitute Jill Roord. In other games Sweden defeated Chile 2-0, striking late after torrential rain stopped play and the US crushed Thailand. In the Cricket World Cup: Bangladesh v Sri Lanka was rained off, in a tournament-record third abandonment in the space of five days. A decision was taken to abandon the game without a ball being bowled shortly before 2pm \u2013 three-and-a-half hours after play was scheduled to begin \u2013 meaning both sides took a point. Bangladesh coach Steve Rhodes has bemoaned the lack of reserve days. Thinking time: \u2018There was a Rolling Thunder energy\u2019 In May 1975, his marriage breaking up, Bob Dylan spent six weeks in the south of France. His host, an artist named David Oppenheim, had recently provided a painting for the back cover of Blood on the Tracks, an album of seemingly confessional songs that had taken Dylan back to the top of the charts. Critics acclaimed its songs as evidence that, after almost a decade of straying from the straight and narrow, he was prepared once again to bare his soul. But Dylan, as usual, was restless. He was looking for something new, and he found it when Oppenheim introduced him to the Camargue, a land of salt marshes, wild horses and a village called Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. There he witnessed the annual gathering of Roma, arriving from across Europe for the spring festival in celebration of Saint Sarah. It was the general sense of a travelling community with a natural way of expressing its culture that inspired the next and typically unexpected phase of his career. \u201cThere was a Rolling Thunder energy and that was his invention,\u201d Joan Baez says in Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story, the documentary by Martin Scorsese released this week on Netflix. Using verite and concert footage, some of it first seen in Dylan\u2019s long-buried feature film Renaldo and Clara, Scorsese reframes that energy while adding a layer of meta-reality that reflects Dylan\u2019s enduring fascination with masks, disguises and alternative facts. Media roundup The ABC reports that the NSW Labor leadership hopeful Chris Minns \u201creceived a $5,000 \u2018moving expenses\u2019 payment as part of a six-figure donation to Labor by an association linked to a Sydney businessman with deep links to the Chinese Communist party\u201d, and that Chris Bowen, Labor\u2019s federal health spokesman, \u201cwas the beneficiary of the $100,000 donation from which Mr Minns\u2019s payment was drawn\u201d. The Sydney Morning Herald says there is a crisis in hospital wait times in NSW, with \u201crecord numbers of patients swamping emergency departments\u201d.
