As I understand it, it entails a challenge to all of us to assume responsibility for our condition. This cannot be achieved by affirming values as universal because they belong to our particular vocabulary (\u201cbasic human aspirations\u201d, \u201cfundamental rights and freedom\u201d, \u201cessential, individual rights\u201d, etc). It can only be achieved by grappling with the different realities of those who think and feel not as we do. I don\u2019t believe that this challenge is adequately met by arguing that there is no difference between Putin\u2019s Russia or Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary and China. Neither Russia nor Hungary has anything in its national background to compare with the millennia of historical time during which China has been governed with a wisdom, pragmatism and commitment to compromise, neither nationalistic nor colonialising, which was quite un-European. Nobody has a monopoly on cruelty, but an entire cultural history of alternative thinking about how human life should be organised cannot responsibly be dismissed as just a \u201cfig leaf for oppression\u201d.
