It features Mathieu Kassovitz and Reda Kateb as cucumber-cool nuclear submarine commanders, Omar Sy as the tough second-in-command, and Fran\u00e7ois Civil as Chanteraide, a savant-genius \u201cacoustic warfare analyst\u201d \u2013 an earphone-wearing military geek with super-hearing who can tell from tiny bleeps and eerie echoes in the vast oceanic depths what kind of sub they\u2019re facing and where it is. The setting is France, proud possessor of an independent nuclear deterrent. But the French are tricked by a rogue terrorist fanatic into activating the retaliatory nuclear strike protocol against Russia \u2013 that is, getting into position to launch a missile from a submarine commanded by Grandchamp (Kateb), targeted at the Russian territory from where the attack has apparently originated \u2013 but that was an empty missile. The sub\u2019s own attack cannot be cancelled and its crew have instructions to treat any countermand as an enemy imposture. So a second sub is sent after the first, commanded by Alfost (Kassovitz) with troubled genius Chanteraide on board, desperate to get a message over to their buddies \u2013 or else face the awful necessity of torpedoing their own comrades. It\u2019s pretty broad stuff, and the film doesn\u2019t linger over the rights and wrongs of nuclear weapons, nor does it spell out precisely what kind of terrorist wants to incinerate the whole world in a nuclear firestorm. But it\u2019s entertaining to revisit the classic tropes of submarine movies: claustrophobia, tense silence, sweating faces, cat-and-mouse strategy \u2013 all ingeniously played out between people who are supposed to be on the same team. \u2022 The Wolf\u2019s Call is released in the UK on 6 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
