As a journalist, commentator and author, in a five-decade career that focused overwhelmingly on the Middle East, Fisk expressed strong views about who was responsible for the region\u2019s agonies, and provoked equally strong responses. Even a partial list of his postings and assignments reads like the battle roll of the post-colonial wars he despised: post-revolution Lisbon, Belfast, Tehran, Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad, Algiers, Kabul, Sarajevo. He was a vigorous opponent of the new-fangled concept of \u201cembedded journalism\u201d. Latterly, however, his own embedded reports on the continuing civil war in Syria, which tended to absolve the Assad regime of some of the worst crimes credited to it, provoked a backlash, even among his anti-imperialist acolytes. The last three of Fisk\u2019s journalistic decades, from 1989 onwards, were spent at the Independent, where he rapidly reinforced his reputation as one of Britain\u2019s best-known foreign correspondents. He had by then won plaudits as a serious historian for his book In Time of War (1983), on the origins and consequences of Irish neutrality in the second world war. It was the subject of a thesis that had earned him a doctorate at Trinity College Dublin. Fisk had been posted to Northern Ireland in 1972 by the Times at the height of the Troubles, and would later take Irish citizenship. The Irish book was followed by Pity the Nation (1990), a history of Lebanon at war. Cynical colleagues, and subeditors often exasperated by his voluminous prose, greeted the publication of the 700-page tome by dubbing it Pity the Reader. Fisk\u2019s reputation was well-established by late 1993, when he scored the first of three exclusive interviews with Osama bin Laden. It was an example of his dogged journalistic determination to get to the root of a story, even in those pre-9/11 days when an interview with the head of al-Qaida was not top of most foreign editors\u2019 wishlists. For all the controversy generated by his later commentary on the evils of western, and specifically US, involvement in the Middle East, Fisk was fundamentally an old-school, door-stepping reporter. He was born in Maidstone, Kent, the son of Peggy (nee Rose) and Bill Fisk. His father, the local borough treasurer, was a veteran of the first world war trenches. Bob, an only child, had a conflictive relationship with his abrasive and sometimes bullying father, with whom he shared summer holidays touring the battlefields of the western front. What Bill did teach his son was that war was \u201ca great, terrible waste\u201d, a judgment that informed the younger Fisk\u2019s lifelong pacifism and suspicion of war-mongering regimes. That lesson coincided with an emerging fascination with journalism that was inspired, Bob said, by watching Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Foreign Correspondent when he was 12. In the film its journalist hero is described as \u201cone of the soldiers of the press, one of the little army of historians who are writing history from beside the cannon\u2019s mouth\u201d. It was one of several ironies of Fisk\u2019s career that he was a pacifist who displayed an almost Boy\u2019s Own enthusiasm for getting beside the cannon\u2019s mouth. Despite his best intentions in chronicling the horrors of war, his expressive prose would often reflect the vicarious excitement of being in the thick of it. In early April 2002, the two of us sought shelter in the home of a local teacher in Bethlehem, as the Israeli army invaded the Palestinian town. We spent the day watching from the window as Israeli soldiers advanced, while trying to keep abreast of developments from the local TV news. While my mundane report barely scraped on to the front page of the sober Financial Times the following day, Fisk enthralled his Independent readers with a colourful, riveting and extensive account of looming danger and derring-do. As he recalled in The Great War for Civilisation (2005): \u201cMore shooting now from outside our window. A tank came down the road, its barrel clipping the green awning of a shop and then swaying upwards to point directly at our window. We decamped to the stairwell. Had they seen us watching them?\u201d All perfectly true. However, Fisk\u2019s vivid and quasi-novelistic style helped to fuel gossip from journalists whose stories he frequently trumped, that he was prone to exaggeration to the point of making it up. One distinguished American contemporary noted that Fisk had become a hero throughout the Arab world for his critical reporting on western policies in the Middle East, but that he was loathed by many colleagues, who accused him of sloppy and deceitful reporting. The reality is that he exuded a nervous journalistic energy and commitment that prompted him to chase any possible lead. At the height of the civil war in Lebanon, which he made his second home, Fisk would head for the exit of the Commodore hotel bar at the slightest echo of a ricochet, even as more jaded colleagues were ordering the next round. In the 1990s Fisk stayed in Lebanon throughout the western hostage crisis, while other correspondents and news organisations sensibly relocated to the safety of Cyprus. Ditto civil war-era Algeria, where he trawled a perilous souk that others feared to tread. On a trip to a camp close to the Afghanistan/Pakistan border, he was battered to near insensibility by a gang of irate refugees. He chose to blame western imperialism for the assault, rather than them. Fisk later coined a phrase for those he viewed as less intrepid competitors. They were guilty of \u201chotel journalism\u201d. Writing from Baghdad in 2005, he accused western journalists of reporting from their hotels rather than the streets. \u201cMost use Iraqi stringers, part-time correspondents who risk their lives to conduct interviews for American or British journalists, and none can contemplate a journey outside the capital without days of preparation unless they \u2018embed\u2019 themselves with American or British forces.\u201d A further irony of Fisk\u2019s career is that, in contrast to his anti-mainstream reputation, it followed the textbook trajectory of an aspiring journalist of his generation: after working on the student newspaper at his university (Lancaster), he joined first a regional paper (the Newcastle Chronicle), then the Sunday Express, followed by the Times (1972-89) and the Independent. Some of Fisk\u2019s most ardent admirers have suggested that to describe his journalism as controversial is a vulgar slight. He may well have twigged that the future of journalism was as a commentator and a polemicist, although not, in his case, one who exercised their trade from the safety of their desktop. He was a media star who nevertheless preferred to address obscure community groups on the intricacies of the Israel-Palestine question rather than appear as a talking head on prime-time TV. Then again, how many other print reporters have been invited on to Desert Island Discs, as he was in 2006? Fisk cultivated the myth of the intrepid loner. In real life he was companionable and outgoing, a talker to a fault. He could drive colleagues to distraction with his frenetic pastiches of their foibles and endeavours. But if you ever found yourself boxed into a grim and threatening corner at the other side of the world, you could do worse than have Fisky by your side. His first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife. \u2022 Robert William Fisk, journalist, born 12 July 1946; died 30 October 2020 \u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2020.
