The family were very scared\u2019", "bodyText": "\u201cI think most of the time I\u2019m still just the same,\u201d Claire Danson says as we sit beneath a cold and darkening sky in the secluded gardens attached to the spinal unit at Salisbury hospital. The European triathlon champion, who won her 30-34 age category in June and then finished fifth overall when racing against men at the London triathlon in July, smiles in her wheelchair. Claire has been paralysed from the waist down since her bike was hit by a tractor while she was training on 28 August. She will never walk again and yet, as the remarkable 30-year-old explains, this is not her most difficult challenge. She is being tested in all kinds of ways \u2013 from basic bodily functions to psychological adversity. Claire looks up with clear eyes as complex emotions flicker across her face. \u201cI\u2019m still happy,\u201d she says gently. \u201cBut I find being on my own the hardest. Your brain starts to think. Before the accident I used to be busy all the time and I didn\u2019t have much time for thinking. Now there are times where you\u2019re lying in bed or just waiting for help. Late at night, when the hospital is quiet and dark, is the toughest time.\u201d A Monday afternoon is different. Claire is with me and, more importantly, her sister Alex, who won Olympic gold with the GB women\u2019s hockey team in 2016. Two years later, in September 2018, Alex suffered a freak head injury that caused mild brain trauma and meant she could not cope with bright light or noise for over nine months. She was on holiday with her boyfriend, now her husband, and she threw back her head and laughed when he told her a joke. She hit her head against a brick wall and the damage became evident as the days, weeks and months passed. The 34-year-old Alex is still recovering but she is hopeful of returning to the GB hockey squad, which she captains, next month. Claire helped look after her big sister when Alex was confined to bed, in a darkened room, for months. Now, after Claire\u2019s accident, Alex spends as much time as she can at her sister\u2019s side. It feels raw when I arrive early at the spinal unit, not having met Claire before, and I wonder how she must feel at the prospect of talking about her changed life. I am only due to meet Alex in half an hour but it does not take long for word to reach Claire that I am in reception. It says much about her character that she wheels her way down the corridor to find me. I like her immediately and it seems natural to ask about the 10km wheelchair race she completed around Dorney Lake, near Windsor, nine days earlier \u2013 just 12 weeks after doctors warned that she might not live. From extreme gravity to the joy of her first race in a wheelchair sums up Claire\u2019s resilience and ambition to find a new life. When the three of us talk later in the garden, Claire pulls an amused face when I ask if she gave herself a metaphorical pat on the back after whizzing around Dorney Lake, with the help of friends who pushed her. \u201cMy reaction was \u2018I wish I could have done more myself\u2019 or \u2018I wish I could\u2019ve been quicker,\u2019\u201d she replies. \u201cIt\u2019s the way I\u2019m wired and will suit me in this new situation. When I achieve things I feel good but then I\u2019m automatically telling myself: \u2018OK, but what\u2019s next?\u2019 I suppose I could say: \u2018Yeah, that was really good.\u2019 But I\u2019m not really like that.\u201d Claire still sounds like an athlete. \u201cThere\u2019s always something else to do, to get better. I\u2019m lucky. It would be really easy in this situation to give up if you didn\u2019t have that motivation. But that\u2019s ingrained in me as an athlete. It\u2019s a big asset now.\u201d Alex speaks about her own injury and her sister with spellbinding eloquence. She encourages me to be totally open and so I ask Claire if it would be all right to explain what happened on the day she was paralysed. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d Claire says lightly. \u201cIt was around 11 o\u2019clock. I\u2019d swum with my friend that morning and come home. It was my normal day. I\u2019d had a coffee. Then I said bye to mum and told her where I was riding, as she always asked. I waved goodbye to mum and started to ride. I remember taking a route I\u2019ve done hundreds of times before. I went around this corner, seeing a vehicle, and that was it. And then I remember saying \u2018Stuart\u2019 a lot. He was first on the scene.\u201d For Alex, \u201cIt was an incredible coincidence: he was our family friend. Stuart is a retired anaesthetist and the doctors think he saved Claire\u2019s life because he was very calm. He cancelled the ambulance and called the air ambulance because he understood the seriousness. When the hospital heard he was a retired anaesthetist they didn\u2019t question it. They got an air ambulance to Claire in six minutes.\u201d Stuart\u2019s daughter was Claire\u2019s best friend and Alex shakes her head in wonder. \u201cClaire was in a very rural part of Hampshire, where my family live, and it was a miracle he decided to take that route into the village.\u201d Claire must have been in terrible pain as her spinal cord has been completely severed, causing instant paralysis, and she had fractured all the bones in her neck, broken every one of her ribs, both wrists and shoulders, as well as suffering two punctured lungs. \u201cThe brain has a way of blocking out that kind of thing,\u201d Claire says. \u201cI remember going to the trauma department and I was conscious all through it.\u201d Alex was at home that day. \u201cI\u2019d been recovering at home for months and it was then that my brother called my husband,\u201d she remembers. \u201cHe said: \u2018You need to get to hospital quickly. Claire\u2019s been in a terrible accident.\u2019 My husband and I got to the hospital before Claire. I\u2019ve never seen so many doctors so we knew Claire was in a very bad way. She was conscious and no one could understand it because her injuries were so significant. They said pain alone should have knocked her out. They said she only survived because she was so fit. After the London triathlon she was in the best condition she\u2019s ever been in. They let us speak to her very briefly.\u201d Alex looks at her little sister. \u201cYou were looking awful \u2026\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d Claire says. \u201cYou said a few words. Most of it was sorry. We were like: \u2018Don\u2019t be silly, you\u2019ll be absolutely fine.\u2019\u201d Alex looks at me. \u201cClaire knew straight away. She spoke before she was put on to the ventilator and said: \u2018Alex I\u2019m paralysed.\u2019 She was very poorly and could hardly breathe and I just remember saying: \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019re still here. Stay with us, stay strong.\u2019\u201d Claire\u2019s family were made to understand her life was in the balance. \u201cThe NHS are amazing but quite brutal as well,\u201d Alex says. \u201cWe were told very early she might not survive. They were very honest. Almost too honest. They said the family should stay close by that night. We were very scared. \u201cClaire was on incredibly high drugs which are dissociative. So while you know you\u2019re paralysed it\u2019s almost as though you are having this out-of-body experience. But it was still absolutely horrific for Claire. The one moment in hospital that nearly broke us was when we were round her bed with the consultant. Claire is very intelligent. She knew what was going on even though she was in and out of the [induced] coma and ventilated. The consultant said: \u2018You\u2019re going to have back surgery, then we are going to try and save that right arm. You\u2019ve got a T9 [vertebrae] complete sever and you\u2019ve broken every bone in your neck so we might have to operate on that too.\u2019 Claire started getting agitated. \u201cI said: \u2018Claire, do you want to say something?\u2019 She nodded. So she held my hand and we went through the alphabet. I would say A, B, C and she squeezed my hand when I got to the first letter in a word. You can imagine how slow the process is. Claire spelt out: \u2018I don\u2019t care when, want best surgeon.\u2019 I kept thinking: \u2018God, this is awkward.\u2019 But the consultant said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, Claire, he will do the absolute best job.\u2019\u201d Claire still insisted on getting Alex to check with her friend\u2019s mother, Sophie Wallace, an orthopaedic surgeon, that she would be operated on by the right person. \u201cBear in mind it took about 30 minutes for Claire to spell out a sentence,\u201d Alex says. \u201cThe consultant couldn\u2019t believe how sound of mind Claire was given her horrendous injuries. She then spelled out \u2013 and this got us all \u2013 \u2018para athlete\u2019. The consultant said: \u2018Claire, do you want me to check with Sophie Wallace that our surgeon is good enough because you want to become a para athlete?\u2019\u201d Alex pauses when asked to describe her emotions in that moment. \u201cI melted inside. It\u2019s the mark of who Claire is. I can\u2019t fathom, whilst you\u2019re in that pain and that terrifying situation, how you still consider a hopeful future. Triathlon was Claire\u2019s life and she was fabulous at it. When I was unwell, and lived at my parents for a while, she\u2019d get up at four so she could do her training and be back at eight \u2013 roughly when I\u2019d wake up. She would be with me from eight until two when she\u2019d start working. That sums up Claire. \u201cWhen I heard those words \u2018para athlete\u2019 I remember thinking: \u2018Please give us something, please let this surgeon be good.\u2019 And he was fabulous and the human body is phenomenal. Look at Claire now, and apart from the obvious, you can\u2019t believe she was fighting for her life 12 weeks ago. Claire is such a bubbly, full-of-life human. But this is life-changing, and incredibly difficult for even the strongest person. Her life is looking very different. In another year she\u2019ll be living independently, and doing her thing again. But, at the moment, day-to-day is very difficult.\u201d As a way of coping with the difficulty Claire has been brave and open on her Instagram page. She has written about the fact that she suffered terrible anxiety before she met many of her friends at a day organised by Alex. The day went well but it was hard for Claire to imagine people seeing her in a wheelchair for the first time. She has also written about the hidden realities of paralysis and that, unable to move the muscles she needs to empty her bladder, she will eventually have to learn either to catheterise herself or have a small hole drilled next to her belly button so she can emit urine when she goes to the toilet. \u201cI knew she was pretty extraordinary,\u201d Alex says of Claire, \u201cbut her posts are so powerful. We put something on her Instagram and overnight she had 15,000 followers supporting her. The obvious thing \u2013 that you can\u2019t walk \u2013 is the easy part in some ways. That\u2019s terrible to say but no one thinks about bowel care or the catheter. Claire was initially unsure about writing it down but she decided it\u2019s important people understand the self-care that accompanies a spinal injury. That\u2019s where I think she will help an enormous amount of people and, in her own way, change the world.\u201d Alex looks at Claire again. \u201cSay the first thing you said to me in the ICU.\u201d Claire smiles. \u201cI said: \u2018I know this is a bit morbid but will you take some photos? I want to document it.\u2019 I\u2019m so weird. But the idea of sharing the photos and emotions is to show that a lot of stuff is relatable. The feelings I face here can relate to 1,001 things in life. We all have struggles and, often, our feelings are the same. I want to teach people that actually there are many more difficult things than the problem we\u2019re facing right now. Sometimes people jump to conclusions about others without actually knowing the struggles they face. All you can do is be kind and do the best you can by everyone.\u201d Claire listens when I say that I admire the way in which her posts do not skirt the darkness of her situation. She tells people her life does sometimes feel bleak and hard. She writes about her boyfriend who reassures her that nothing has changed \u2013 before she gently reminds him that everything has changed. They have found a way to talk openly, just like Claire addresses the world so honestly. \u201cIt\u2019s important people don\u2019t just see me and think: \u2018Oh, she\u2019s having a great time,\u2019\u201d Claire says wryly. \u201cYou look at other people on social media and think: \u2018How amazing is their life? I wish I had that.\u2019 Well, you\u2019ve probably seen 1% of their life they\u2019ve chosen to share. I think it\u2019s important to see everything.\u201d Alex nods. \u201cYou\u2019re very good at being honest. We always say we have to talk about it. So if I\u2019m not feeling great, Claire\u2019s the first person I tell.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Claire replies, \u201cbecause I want you to tell me. Sometimes people will say to me: \u2018I can\u2019t complain because I\u2019ve only hurt my finger.\u2019 Yeah you can. It\u2019s your biggest issue right now. Of course you can complain.\u201d As for her paralysis, Claire says: \u201cI think you have to accept it. I\u2019m sure some people don\u2019t. But I don\u2019t feel my life is over. So there wasn\u2019t any doubt about para sport. I have to do sport because it\u2019s so important to me and ingrained in our family. I\u2019ve just got to find out how I\u2019m going to do it, and find a way of doing it as well. I guess sport makes you more resilient.\u201d Alex says: \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet in what sport, but Claire will compete again. She\u2019ll get there, without a shadow of a doubt.\u201d Claire hopes to leave hospital at the end of January. When I ask her to describe a typical session of rehab she reveals that she made another breakthrough that morning while Alex and I had been chatting over a coffee. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to build my upper body strength. In the session I\u2019ve just had I transferred myself from the physio bed to my chair.\u201d \u201cDid you?\u201d Alex exclaims. \u201cYes, but I used the aides as I don\u2019t quite have the strength to do it on my own. There\u2019s a board, which you go on to sideways and then you slide down it into the chair, using your hands.\u201d \u201cWere you on your own? \u201cSarah [a physiotherapist] was there. But she didn\u2019t need to support me.\u201d \u201cClaire,\u201d Alex says, \u201cthat\u2019s unbelievable!\u201d I ask if she had a feeling of \u201cWow!\u201d when she did it. \u201cYeah, I did. But then I thought: \u2018We needed the board and the slide sheet.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t do three somersaults on the way down,\u201d Alex jokes. \u201cThe next thing will be to get enough lift so I move from the bed to the chair on my own.\u201d \u201cClaire,\u201d Alex insists, \u201cthis is massive.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Claire says, \u201cbut I need to go much further.\u201d I know she will and so when we talk about the question of identity \u2013 and how she once defined herself as a successful triathlete \u2013 I tell Claire how I see her. I\u2019ve known her for only a couple of hours but I don\u2019t see her as someone who had a terrible accident and ended up in a wheelchair. I see a young woman who seems certain to do extraordinary things. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Claire says. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve got to get my mind around. I\u2019m now re-forming as someone who is still the same but with different aims. Maybe they are more important goals in some respects \u2013 because I\u2019m trying to help other people. In the past I achieved the things I wanted but it would\u2019ve just been about me. It wouldn\u2019t have helped anyone else. So maybe what I will do from now on is more important.\u201d Alex looks up. \u201cRemember what we always say, Dobbie,\u201d she murmurs, using the nickname she gave her sister when Claire helped her get over her head injury. Alex and Claire, the recovering hockey player and the new para athlete, clasp hands. Amid that love and support, there is suddenly so much light and hope around them. \u201cYeah,\u201d Claire says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same but different \u2026\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
