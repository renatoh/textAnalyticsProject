Can \u201cthe Monterey five\u201d keep their secret in the face of such a formidable inquisitor? Mike Bradley The 1900 Island 7pm, BBC Two Harsh times straight away for four families living like turn-of-the-century villagers on the Anglesey coast: as their experiment begins, it is too stormy to fish. Then, when they do catch something tasty, a pair of classic reality villains emerge to threaten community spirit. The series continues, in salty fashion, all week.

Ali Catterall War on Plastic With Hugh and Anita 9pm, BBC One As newspapers and scientists sound the alarm about plastic waste, it is the perfect time for this three-part campaigning series, which follows Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Anita Rani\u2019s attempt to get to the root of the problem. Along the way, they orchestrate a useful domestic recycling experiment on a street in Bristol, reveal why bottled water is a con, and expose uncomfortable truths about plastic recycling.
