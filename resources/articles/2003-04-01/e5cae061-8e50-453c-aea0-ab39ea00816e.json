Winning the peace is infinitely more complex and challenging, particularly given the Bush administration's short attention span, its predilection for the quick fix, and its aversion to 'nation-building'. Some examples since the end of the Cold War: Bosnia Origins: 42 months of war, Serbian ethnic cleansing and Western hand-wringing in 1992-95 climaxed with the Srebrenica massacre by Serbs of 7,000 Muslims. Treatment: Bosnia became an international laboratory for post Cold War nation-building, with not terribly encouraging results. The Dayton agreements of November 1995 ended the war by creating a single but partitioned state divided into Serb and Muslim-Croat entities policed by international troops and lorded over by the international high representative - currently Paddy Ashdown - who enjoys colonial-style powers over the locals. Corruption is endemic, crime rampant, integration patchy; return of refugees to their homes is picking up but still low seven years into the peace. Nationalist political parties dominate despite years of Western policy aimed at weakening them. Verdict: Opinion divided as to whether the Bosnian bottle is half-full or half-empty. Resignation, cynicism, and despair prevail. Few would bet on Bosnia becoming a normal integrated polity without international coercion. Kosovo Origins: Slobodan Milosevic's 1998 campaign of ethnic cleansing of the majority Albanians was the climax of his disastrous Greater Serbia project, finally provoking Nato into its first war after seven years of mayhem in former Yugoslavia. Milosevic was defeated in June 1999 and the region made an international protectorate. Treatment: Under Michael Steiner, the German diplomat who is international viceroy in Kosovo, peacekeeping troops and international civil servants administer the province in league with Albanian institutions. But lawlessness is rife, bombings, shootings, and organised crime are huge problems, while the Serb minority is at acute risk. Serbia still lays claim to the province, but possession is nine-tenths of the law for Albanians. The future is uncertain while it is unclear whether Kosovo will be an independent statelet, part of a loose federation with Serbia and Montenegro or carved up between Serbs and Albanians. Steiner avoids political discussion of Kosovo's final status in order to concentrate on institution-building. Verdict: An independent Albanian Kosovo most likely outcome, but the province is far from being able to run its own affairs yet or to function as a state. Afghanistan Origins: 11 September precipitated a US war against the Taliban regime in 2001 because of its patronage of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda. Treatment: The Taliban collapsed swiftly under the US onslaught in November 2001. The opposition Tajik Northern Alliance staggered into Kabul and appropriated the spoils of victory under US protection, while the Pashtun Hamid Karzai was handpicked as the conciliatory, if weak, national leader. Fifteen months ago $5 billion in reconstruction aid was pledged by the international community, while a 10,000-strong international peacekeeping force polices security in Kabul. On any available indice, from literacy to child mortality, however, Afghanistan is probably the globe's most benighted country outside Africa. A quarter century of war and foreign occupation have left a terrible legacy. Foreign aid pledges are predictably not being redeemed, American attention is wandering, the peacekeepers are confined to Kabul while the regions remain under the rule of the gun and of warlords. Verdict: Things are much better than under the Taliban. Two million refugees have gone home. Agricultural output doubled last year. Literacy and schooling programmes are booming. But the aid effort is confused and faltering. The problems are so daunting that decades of sustained international dedication are required. An early indication of the political temper will be general elections slated for next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
