The Brazilian had directed his ire at the officials as his team shed points in recent weeks but this time, as the home support rejoiced in unlikely parity, it was his players who endured the brunt of his criticism. Sloppiness crept into Chelsea's approach here and, with 11 points now surrendered from the past seven matches, they have slipped adrift of Liverpool at the top. Twice Clint Dempsey squeezed out space in a cluttered penalty area to score, his second securing a draw when Chelsea had seemed comfortable. Scolari had already appeared to argue with Jose Bosingwa on the touchline 11 minutes from the end over a tactical tweak as the hosts made a double substitution. The manager was just as animated in furious debate with Petr Cech as the players departed after the final whistle. \"I was asking Petr who was marking which players,\" explained Scolari. \"He's the captain when it comes to marking in the area. I give him the power to say this or say that to the players. But there was one Fulham player in the middle of the area, free, in the last minute. That's incredible. That goal was a mistake. \"Every player knows who to mark when we start a game. It's my job now to look and ask what happened in this situation. But I'm not telling you who was supposed to mark [Dempsey]. It's my job, my dressing room. It was a mistake. We spoke at half-time, who was supposed to be marking who and who was supposed to be covering. It's normal. After every goal we try to make sure that doesn't happen again. But at the corner in the last minute we made another mistake. \"They scored two of their three chances. We had 10 chances and scored twice. We had more free-kicks and corners than them, and we've been good at those this season, but not today. Very frustrating.\" The apparent confusion at the heart of the visitors' rearguard may have had much to do with the suspended John Terry's absence \u2014 the England captain will return at Manchester United on January 11 \u2014 but doubt is spreading through this setup. Scolari's substitution of Joe Cole after 72 minutes, with the scores still level and Deco peripheral yet again, had some of the travelling support chanting: \"You don't know what you're doing.\" Their mood was improved by Frank Lampard's free-kick seconds later, but relief was temporary. And Scolari has other issues to ponder this morning. Both Alex and Florent Malouda succumbed to hamstring complaints, the former's departure balanced by the return of Ricardo Carvalho for his first appearance since October 29. Chelsea are not used to wasting leads but they have been punished five times already this season in all competitions \u2014 Arsenal and Burnley (on penalties) have recovered deficits to win, and Fulham joined Bordeaux and Tottenham in securing draws. Furthermore, the league titles under Jose Mourinho were each claimed with perfect records over Christmas. This year, as in the past two seasons, there have been too many draws for comfort. \"We gained a point at Everton [on December 22] but lost two today,\" said Scolari, who praised Andre Marriner's display despite having appeared to wave a finger accusingly in the referee's face before the tete-a-tete with Cech. \"But the championship was not finished today. It'll go down to the last two or three games. That's normal in England. Last season, one team [Arsenal] were nine points clear and lost it. It's a difficult championship.We are three points behind Liverpool but we carry on.\" So do Fulham. This was a ninth Premier League game without defeat and a rousing way to celebrate Roy Hodgson's anniversary since taking the reins. They were 19th and on their kneeswhen he took over; they go into the new year in the top half of the table. \"It's been a great year,\" he said. \"I got thrown in at the deep end and we had a very poor start. It took us well into February to win a game. \"To turn that around as the players did with such fantastic work and commitment ... it was a great feeling to stay in the division. To kick on andfinish the year in the top half of the table is very satisfying. But nine games unbeaten can become three straight defeats. We don't for one minute believe it's going to be any easier from now on in.\" That is a sentiment Scolari would share."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
