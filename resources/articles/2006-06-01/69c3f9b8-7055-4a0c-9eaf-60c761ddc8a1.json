What is he? A scientist with the solution to global warming? The financial whizzkid who can save the country from bankruptcy in 2012? Nope - he's an accordion player, winner of Radio 2's Young Folk Award in 1998 and an integral part of folk powerhouse Waterson:Carthy. And now he has a new solo album out: Stiffs Lovers Holymen Thieves, featuring some of folk's most talented musicians - fiddler Nancy Kerr, percussionist Pete Flood, guitarist Oliver Knight and, on upright bass, Colin Fletcher. Van Eyken tells Mike Harding (8pm, Radio 2) how he freshened up traditional favourites such as Worcester City, Australia and Young Alvin. In Performance On 3 (7.30pm, Radio 3) Martin Handley presents a Stravinsky concert from Birmingham's Symphony Hall. In the first half, Sakari Oramo conducts the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in Four Studies for Orchestra and is then joined by soloist Daniel Hope for Stravinsky's Violin Concerto. The concert concludes with one of the most virtuosic scores from this master of orchestration - the musical fairytale of The Nightingale. And (sigh) the footie: Spain v Ukraine at 2pm, Tunisia v Saudi Arabia at 5pm, Germany v Poland at 8pm. All on 5 Live. Review"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
