The move has angered a union representing support workers, which claims these platforms undercut wages and conditions and aren\u2019t subject to the same oversight as registered NDIS providers. \u201cWe do have members that work for these platform providers and we regularly have issues arising around the inadequacy of their pay, the inadequacy of their training, or the complete absence of training,\u201d said the Australian Services Union NSW/ACT secretary, Natalie Lang. The NDIS website now lists 15 matching platforms on its website on a page titled \u201cfinding support workers\u201d. Since April the agency has promoted the platforms to participants, who in some cases manage their own funds and plans, and also to potential workers seeking a \u201cnew, rewarding job in disability services\u201d. The models vary but the platforms generally allow workers to create a profile, listing their hourly price and experience, with participants able to select a support worker through the app. In some cases workers are rated by clients and this rating is attached to their profile. Some matching platforms being spruiked by the NDIA are also registered NDIS providers. But others merely connect participants to support workers who are considered independent contractors, with the apps noting they are not responsible for the services provided or the conduct of workers. A Victorian parliamentary inquiry into the gig economy found in a report in June that \u201cunregistered providers are not subject to audit\u201d by the scheme\u2019s watchdog, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. The report warned there was \u201cconcern and confusion about who was responsible for the health and safety of nonemployee caring platform workers\u201d. One disability services sector peak body was worried they could \u201ccircumvent certain regulations and safeguards which exist for \u2018traditional\u2019 not-for-profit service providers, thus posing a risk to people with disability\u201d. Unions have accused some platforms of paying below award wages and the inquiry\u2019s own national survey found \u201ccare platform workers estimated earning, on average, $21.60 per hour\u201d \u2013 less than the casual rate in the award of $26.22 an hour. But some platforms claim they enforce minimum rates above the casual award rate. The Labor senator Tony Sheldon likened the platforms to \u201cUber for disability workers\u201d. Sheldon questioned whether the public wanted \u201cunregulated for-profit gig platforms undermining the not-for-profit providers who pay their care workers properly\u201d. \u201cJob insecurity and lack of regulation has been a disaster for aged care, and under this government disability care is headed down the same path,\u201d he said. Given that the NDIS is intended to operate as a free marketplace, Lang also accused the agency of \u201cpicking winners\u201d by specifically promoting the matching platforms. \u201cOne has to wonder when there are over 9,000 active registered NDIS providers why would the government choose this handful of providers to promote,\u201d she said. Asked why it was promoting the apps, an NDIA spokesman said the agency had taken steps to ensure access to participants did not miss out on support during the pandemic. This included \u201cinformation for participants to find support workers through a host of matching platforms\u201d. \u201cThe agency rejects any suggestion it was \u2018picking winners\u2019 by taking action to provide information regarding matching platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cParticipants continued to choose who delivered their supports and services.\u201d An NDIS Commission spokesperson said the watchdog regulated all providers \u201cwhether they are registered or not\u201d. \u201cSome platform providers are registered, others are not,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWhether a platform provider is required to be registered depends on the nature of their business model, which includes the direct role they may have in facilitating the delivery of supports and services to an NDIS participant.\u201d A peak advocacy organisation for disability, People With Disability Australia, was approached for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
