Jelena Dokic is only 20 but she has been a touring pro for five years and would probably argue that she has seen enough in that time to last her a couple of decades. Her teenage years were spent either watching her bumptious father Damir creating a furore or making excuses for him when he did. But after years of being sidetracked by his outbursts, Dokic broke away from him at the end of last year, a decision most observers deemed essential for her career as well as her sanity. Now that, in her words, \"he's not a distraction any more\", Dokic says that, professionally and personally, she is at last finding her voice. That new-found independence has come at a cost though, and has lead to a string of mediocre results this year. Having recently split with Steffi Graf's former coach Heinz G\u00fcnthardt in favour of the little known Croatian Barna Bikic, Dokic will be hoping things change at Wimbledon. Dokic reportedly could not cope with G\u00fcnthardt's disciplinarian approach. There were signs that all was not well with their relationship, which began at the start of this year, after her second-round exit at the French Open three weeks ago. No doubt Bikic will be taking a more gentle approach but he can hardly argue with the raw material he has to work with - the conspicuous gifts that took Dokic to No4 in the world and into a Wimbledon semi-final in 2000. She is now No11. It is no coincidence that her best grand slam result came on the lawns of SW19, where her ground strokes are at their most penetrative and her naturally aggressive instincts are often rewarded. In 1999, as a 16-year-old qualifier, she turned her sport's hierarchy on its head by steamrolling the tournament's top seed Martina Hingis 6-2, 6-0 in the first round. Ironically, the scene of her biggest win was also where her father's antics reached their embarrassing nadir when he had to be escorted off the premises after smashing a television reporter's mobile phone during an incoherent, angry and very public rant. \"I've done well at Wimbledon in the past,\" says Dokic, trying as always to steer conversation away from her father's antics and back to the tennis. \"I think I've put all those things behind me so I don't really think about that when I play there.\" Dokic may not be saying the same after the 2003 championships but, whatever her results in the coming weeks, she says she is taking a long-term view. \"I got to a level where I was very satisfied,\" she says. \"I was four in the world but I knew I could get a lot more out of my game than I was getting. I just wanted to see what I can do. \"Of course I'm not playing now like I did before and that might be a little bit frustrating because things don't come straight away, but I think long term it will be better for me. It might not come this year, but I think eventually it will show and I'll be more satisfied later on. \"It's difficult for me because I don't like to lose but I don't expect too much from this year. But I'm sure, you know, later on it will help me and make me a better person. I think this year I'll be maturing on and off the court.\" That off-court maturity manifests itself in the shape of her boyfriend, the Brazilian racing driver Enrique Bernoldi. His arrival in Dokic's life, this time last year, marked the beginning of her move away from her father and he has clearly been a confidant and a catalyst for change. Not surprisingly Damir Dokic does not view him as son-in-law material, which presumably makes him all the more attractive to his daughter. \"I think we're very similar people and it helps if you have someone who does something similar, especially if he's in sport,\" she says of Bernoldi, who lost his place in formula one when the Arrows team went bust. \"He doesn't interfere in my tennis too much, but if I lose it's sometimes not easy and he understands that. Neither of us likes to lose - we're both the same in that regard. \"He knows how to deal with things better and because he's been in my position before he helps a little bit. And he's older than me, so he's been through a lot more. It's good to have someone like that.\" As the pieces of Dokic's new life start to fall into place there is still one important decision she has yet to make - which country to play for. The move from Australia back to Yugoslavia - although she divides her time now largely between Florida and Monte Carlo - is one she clearly regrets and there are signs that she may return down under. A switch to Britain, mooted by her father last year, now appears just another one of his idle threats. At least Dokic does not have to explain those away any more. \"You know, I'm not where I was and I'm not where I want to be,\" she says, sounding rather too philosophical for a 20-year-old. \"It's just a different stage of my life right now because in my tennis career - and in everything else too - I needed to change.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
