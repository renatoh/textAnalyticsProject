A report by the housing charity Shelter and the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) claims that government plans to overhaul housing benefit would price low-income households out of a third of local authorities in England, pushing them into areas of high unemployment. The changes, to be introduced in 2013, were outlined in last month's welfare reform bill, which established that future increases to local housing allowance for private tenants will be linked to the consumer price index of inflation rather than the cost of local rents. Shelter and CIH warn that this means that, in places where rents rise faster than inflation, housing benefit will increasingly fail to cover housing costs. Their report claims that by 2023, 34% of local authorities outside London will be unaffordable for people claiming local housing allowance, including those in working households on low incomes or unable to work such as pensioners, carers and people with disabilities. Earlier research carried out for Shelter by Cambridge University has already predicted that many on housing benefit in London will have to move out of their homes to areas where rents are lower. But suggestions that those outside the capital will also be affected is likely to revive concerns that the changes will contribute to a form of social engineering that will have consequences for much of the country. \"These changes will mean that the level of housing support that people receive will be based on the average increase in the price of random items like washing machines and a meal out, instead of the rents they pay,\" said Shelter chief executive Campbell Robb. \"As this takes effect, many people will see a big drop in their housing support, leaving them with a stark choice between rent arrears, eviction and possible homelessness, living in overcrowded homes, or moving across the country to an area where they can afford to live but where there are fewer jobs available.\" The local authorities predicted to be most affected are concentrated in the east of England, East Midlands and the south-west, where rents have risen rapidly in recent years. The regions that will still be affordable in 2023 \u2013 the north-east, north-west and Yorkshire and the Humber \u2013 have higher than average rates of economic inactivity and unemployment. The analysis assigned each local authority in England a rent inflation indicator that was used to estimate how long it would take for fewer than 10% of private rented homes to be affordable once the changes were introduced. There are concerns they could undermine the government's aim to get people back to work if they are forced to move away from areas with good employment prospects to those with higher unemployment. Just over a quarter of housing benefit claimants earn low wages. Shelter and CIH warn the changes could mean claimants could find their jobs at risk if they can no longer live close to where they work. \"These changes will undermine the government's own welfare reform ambitions to make work pay and to support people back in to jobs,\" said Sarah Webb, chief executive of CIH. \"You don't help someone back in to work by forcing them to move from neighbourhoods where they have established support networks and make them move to areas with fewer employment opportunities, miles from the very support that can make work viable. We need welfare changes that help get our economy growing again, not changes that will entrench unemployment and dependency further.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
