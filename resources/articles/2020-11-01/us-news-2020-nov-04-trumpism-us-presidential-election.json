But it did not deliver defeat for Trumpism. Democrats had hoped that four years of turmoil, attacks on norms and institutions and mendacity \u2013 plus a pandemic that cost 230,000 lives \u2013 would result in a quick, clean and overwhelming repudiation of the 45th president. That would have been clarifying about the direction of the country, a warning to the Republican party that it must take its 2013 \u201cautopsy\u201d report off the shelf and reinvent itself. But on another miserable night for pollsters, it did not turn out that way. Trump proved resilient and increased his vote in Florida, Texas and other states. He found even more white working-class voters than last time and chipped away at Democratic support among Latinos. His cult-of-personality campaign rallies were as enthusiastic and rambunctious as ever. His victory in 2016, it turns out, was no fluke attributable to Vladimir Putin or James Comey. In 2020 his sexism, racism and lie-telling have been legitimised and emboldened. When some Americans protested \u201cThis is not who we are\u201d, Trump voters replied: \u201cThis is exactly who we are \u2013 and we\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d \u201cThe so-called moral outrage around Trump\u2019s presidency did not produce any substantive shift in his Republican support,\u201d tweeted Eddie Glaude, a professor at Princeton University and author of Democracy in Black. \u201cIn fact, he expanded his base among white voters. Trump continues to flourish in the intersection of greed, selfishness and racism.\u201d Now, if Trump wins the election, Trumpism wins. But if Trump loses the election, Trumpism wins too. A sense of grievance over a narrow defeat, fuelled by the president\u2019s bogus claims of fraud and amplified by conservative media, will thrive again a Democratic president. The \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement \u2013 with its nostalgia for a country that never was \u2013 was built for opposition rather than incumbency. There\u2019s more, Republicans appear to be on course to hold their Senate majority and may end up gaining seats in the House of Representatives. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, and Lindsey Graham were rewarded, not punished, for normalising Trump and enforcing his will. The message to other Republican aspirants is clear. This is Trump\u2019s party now. Furthermore, McConnell would prove an implacable foe to a President Biden. The majority leader memorably declared that his top priority was to make sure Barack Obama was a one-term president. He failed in that but proved a master of obstruction. Now he is likely to repeat the formula with the man who served as Obama\u2019s vice-president for eight years. It is precisely the opposite of what America needs right now: a White House, Senate and House working together and thinking big like Franklin Roosevelt to tackle the pandemic, rebuild the economy and reform healthcare. Instead, expect more gridlock as a Democratic White House is parried at every turn by a Trump-fuelled Republican Senate majority. It is frustration with that type of dysfunction that fed the forces of Trumpism in the first place. The president continues to present himself as an outsider intent on shaking up the system and draining the swamp. Expect also a fusillade of attacks on Biden and scaremongering about what it would mean if he is succeeded by his running mate, Kamala Harris, a woman of colour. That will fire up the base even more. There was a school of thought that a crushing defeat for the Republican party, perhaps even in Texas, would be the best thing that could happen to it, the mother of all wake-up calls. But there was also a theory that \u2013 whatever the outcome \u2013 Trumpism was deep in the Republican party\u2019s bones, and it would take two or three elections to purge it. Now, indeed, the party is clearly committed to his strain of raw populist nationalism, overthrowing the old consensus on trade, immigration and other issues. Likely candidates for 2024? Don\u2019t rule out Donald Trump Jr. Or, for that matter, Donald Trump himself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
