Mr Hughes, the Lib Dems home affairs spokesman, won 63% of the vote, easily beating the party's 2000 mayoral candidate, Susan Kramer, into second place. The Lib Dem MP for Southwark North and Bermondsey will now face the incumbent mayor, Mr Livingstone, and his Conservative and Labour challengers in next May's election. The congestion charge - once billed as the make-or-break issue for the current mayor - may now be less of an issue, after its smooth introduction last month. Although both Mr Hughes and the official Labour candidate, Nicky Gavron, backed the \u00a35 toll in principle, neither were conspicuous by their support ahead of its introduction. Mr Norris - who came second to Mr Livingstone in the high-profile inaugral 2000 election - has been vocal in his opposition to the charge, although he now appears to be backtracking on earlier pledges to scrap it no matter what. The Greens, who have three members on the 25-strong London assembly, have yet to pick their candidate, although Darren Johnson, their candidate last time round, is likely to gain the nomination. Elections to the assembly will be held on the same day as the mayoral poll. Although the body only has the power to scrutinise the mayor's budget, it will also be a weathervane for the big three parties. Mr Hughes pledged to continue Mr Livingstone's congestion charging policy with minor amendments, and predicted that the Norris campaign would suffer from the Conservative candidate's \"foolish\" decision to announce he would scrap it before it had even begun. He said: \"This is an election we believe we can win and I will use all my energy and determination to ensure we do. \"Ken Livingstone was elected last time because he was the folk hero returning from exile. That is no longer the case. He is the very present politician who will have a record we believe we can take him on over.\" Mr Hughes said he would not campaign on \"old battles\" over the part-privatisation of the London Underground, which the Liberal Democrats opposed. Instead, his themes would be the need to improve safety on London's streets, make public transport more reliable and tackle the high level of unemployment in the capital, which he denounced as \"a disgrace\". Mr Hughes pledged his full support to the campaign to bring the Olympics to London in 2012. His party's leader, Charles Kennedy, said he had been frustrated in the 18 months since the 2001 general election by the lack of high profile political contests to fight. \"Now we have got one,\" he said. \"This race is wide open and we are conducting it with one objective and one objective only, and that is to win it. I believe we can. \"I think we have got an exceptionally fine candidate in Simon. I think that we are very, very well placed indeed. Mr Hughes, MP for the south London seat of Bermondsey and Southwark North, said he expected to pick up votes from former supporters of Labour, Tories, Greens and Mr Livingstone, adding that he would not make any recommendation of who his supporters should place second on their ballot paper. Mr Hughes took 3,168 votes (63%), against Ms Kramer's 172 (34%) and Donnachadh McCarthy's 163 (3%). In all, 5,093 Liberal Democrats used their postal votes, a turnout of 56%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
