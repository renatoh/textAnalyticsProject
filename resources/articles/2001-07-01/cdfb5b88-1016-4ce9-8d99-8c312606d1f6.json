Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that retail sales volumes in June matched record levels of a month earlier. Analysts who had been expecting the figure to fall by 0.2% this month will now be waiting to see if the retail spending spree has now peaked. The ONS said the latest figure was 5.6% higher than in June last year. Including the last three months, year-on-year retail sales growth is running at its highest level since September 1988. The figures again signal the existence of a two-track economy, with consumers continuing to spend despite gloom elsewhere in the manufacturing sector. An increase in sales in food stores sustained last month's figures, with a 0.3% rise in business. That came despite an 8.7% year-on-year hike in the cost of groceries as the impact of the foot-and mouth disease bites. Overall, \u00a320.38bn of sales were recorded during June, an increase of 6.9% on the same month last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
