Pendleton could do no more in Beijing than she did, which was to win one gold in the sprint \u2013 as opposed to her male counterpart, Chris Hoy, who claimed three \u2013 but here in the Warsaw suburb of Pruszkow she intends to win the four she believes she is capable of. \"Last year the 500 [metres time trial] was squashed between the sprint heats so it wasn't possible practically [to do it],\" said Pendleton, whose campaign for four golds begins with the 500m, followed by the team sprint, sprint and keirin. \"This time around I'm really doing it because I can.\" The women of the all-conquering British track team could outshine the men, with Wendy Houvenaghel, the Beijing silver medallist, favourite for the women's pursuit in the absence of the Olympic champion, Rebecca Romero. The men's team sprint will see Matt Crampton attempt to fill the absent Hoy's shoes, by joining two-thirds of the triumphant trio from Beijing, Jamie Staff and Jason Kenny. \"The French are going well, but we're pretty confident,\" said Staff. \"Matt is a very good rider \u2013 people forget how good he is.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
