It's a weekly magazine which has always tried to do things quite uncommon in France; that is mixing the serious and the not so serious. It has sex \u2013 but usually only when the people want to make things known \u2013 and also politics. It is here that people announce their wedding, but it was also here that we learned that Cecilia Sarkozy had left Nicolas for a certain Richard. This turned out to be a sad episode in the life of Paris Match, because even if that cover on the love life of our then soon-to-be-president offered one of its best sales ever, the chief editor was sacked by the owner for having dared to publish this story without asking the permission of Sarkozy himself. It says a lot about the French press that its freedom to write about sex and privacy is quite limited. There are two reasons for this. The first is that judges forbid us to write on privacy. But the second is that the editors who have the guts to try to publish put themselves at risk. Their owners go to the same clubs and went to the same school as politicians and no one wants to break the rules. So when Arnaud Lagard\u00e8re, the owner of Paris Match, ousted the editor no one was surprised. No such thing as a tabloid exists in France because they won't publish anything too salacious. There has been no such thing as a sex scandal in France and so no politician was ever be put in danger by a prostitute. Our late Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had his double life, his double family, his double children kept secret. And before him President Giscard d'Estaing had also mistresses and full discretion. The press knew but kept silent. It was only when Giscard wrote a book supposed to be a novel that the French discovered about his sexual fantasies. So that's why I read the Paris Match edition with surprise and pleasure. A very young, completely unknown lady was on the cover and for the first time in the French press, a prostitute was telling everything about her clients. Most surprisingly, the clients were members of Les Bleus, the national football team. It turned out that Franck Rib\u00e9ry, the winger for Bayern Munich, had bought himself the 17-year-old Zahia Dehar for his birthday. His secrets were now in the press. That is something new for France. Of course, in the past, there had been rumours about other players. The great Zidane was supposed to have a mistress. There was a picture with a young singer, but only one small magazine printed it. The other ones never wanted to touch the god Zidane. There had been rumours about another soccer hero, now retired and supposed to be gay, but no one wants to know about it. So why this time? Maybe because all Europe was writing about this and maybe, most of all, because things are changing. After three years of the Sarkozy circus, of him getting separated and back with first wife, then, after that incredible wedding with Carla Bruni, our awareness of sex has changed. We need a fix of reading about sex among the famous. The relationship of every French man or woman with their leaders has changed. We don't see them any longer as sacred but as normal people. And nothing makes people more normal than sex. So will this be the beginning of a great change? Will we begin a hunt for the mistresses of the powerful? Will we ask them about all the dirty secrets? Will we become like Britain? I'm not so sure, because what is so titillating about the Paris Match story is that the very young lady with her very blonde hair and her Algerian origins was for sale. What shocks us is more the money than the sex. Nobody understands why famous soccer players have to pay for sex. Why is Rib\u00e9ry, a married man who converted to Islam for the love of his wife, paying for a girl of 17, a girl who looks exactly like his wife? What are the secrets of that girl? The thing is that she doesn't know herself. She's very young, she is pretty and she refuses to see herself as a prostitute. She explained she is an escort girl. I don't know what the difference is. But now all the politicians, all the ministers will maybe have doubts when they go and see escort girls or when they go to sex clubs. And some are very famous for that. A few years ago, the French culture minister, Jack Lang, dared to go to the opening of one of the great gay sex clubs and even smile for photographs. He knew that the press would be quite discreet and would never ask his wife what she thought. He may not feel the same today. I love to read the British press to see the funny stories about British ministers. No minister in France has ever lost his job over a sexual scandal. Only an adviser to Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin had problems for paying a young prostitute of 16 in the street and getting caught with her by the police. He denied it but nobody believed him. Apart from the Sarkozy circus, that is the only sex scandal of the last 10 years. Maybe soon we will discover it happens far more than we know. I think it would be fun. It would be good for the circulation of the papers. But many French journalists are afraid of that future. It is not our way of thinking. Sex? Yes, we are French. But only in the bedroom please.
