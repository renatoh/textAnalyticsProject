It\u2019s onwards and upwards to next week\u2019s MASSIVE SEMI, which features TWO DANCES. Kick off is at 7pm next Saturday, so join me then! Have a great week, Hx JJ has been a lovely contestant on this year\u2019s Strictly, and has clearly had a ball. He and Amy say lovely things about each other, as is traditional. They both get a bit tearful and they seem to genuinely admire and adore each other. Bit dusty in here. They take to the floor for their final dance, to \u2018Thank You For The Music\u2019 by Abba. Judging time! Craig saves Jamie and Karen, but in an EXCITING TWIST Motsi saves JJ and Amy. So Shirley has the deciding vote, and she picks Jamie and Karen. Which means JJ AND AMY are leaving Strictly. Next up it\u2019s deskography with Jamie and Karen. I didn\u2019t love this Jive last night, but you can\u2019t fault Jamie\u2019s energy and commitment. I suspect he\u2019ll go home next week, and should be incredibly proud of himself for that. Time for the dance off, and JJ and Amy are up first! He\u2019s come a long way since the launch show, and this remains a fun and charming Charleston, but I think JJ has reached the end of his Strictly journey. I didn\u2019t catch whole conversation as my Sainsbury\u2019s delivery has just arrived (which of course I\u2019m not allowed to go anywhere near), but I think Bill just said he\u2019s doing a Tango to \u2018Enter Sandman\u2019 by Metallica next week. Incredible. Time to find out who is joining Jamie and Karen in the bottom two. Bill and Oti are safe, along with Maisie and Gorka! Which means JJ AND AMY are in the dance off. Well that\u2019s the right decision, and I think it\u2019s likely that JJ and Amy will leave. Does Shirley get some kind of bonus scheme every time she mentions JJ\u2019s military background? Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of musical theatre megastar Marisha Wallace, who is singing \u2018Climb Every Mountain\u2019 from The Sound Of Music. Personally I question the wisdom of mountaineering whilst dressed as Dougal from The Magic Roundabout, but maybe I\u2019m taking the whole business too literally. Marisha is accompanied by Anton and Dianne wafting in a romantic fashion. This is all rather lovely. Next week HRVY and JNTT are dancing the first Rumba of the series. I\u2019m torn between \u2018yay, classic latin!\u2019 and \u2018urgh, Rumba\u2019. So who is safely through to next week\u2019s massive semi, and who is in tonight\u2019s bottom two? HRVY and JNTT are safe, along with Ranvir and Giovanni. All as it should be so far. First couple in the bottom two: JAMIE AND KAREN. Up against JJ, surely? Last night on Strictly \u2013 a musical mixed bag. The highlight was very much the Priscilla pro dance, can we see that again? Ranvir, HRVY and Maisie had a good night too, all three of them should absolutely be through to the semis. And we\u2019re off. No opening pro dance, which is confusing me. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Claudia in stylish metallics, Tess in a black off-the-shoulder blouson with massive mutton sleeves. It makes no sense on any level. OK so no pro dance, but a performance from &amp; Juliet instead. I\u2019ve heard this is very good. Tonight\u2019s Countryfile Casual Weatherperson is hirsute weather hunk Tomasz Schafernaker, who is wearing a very snug navy jumper and some nice grey jeans. The temperature is definitely rising, and there\u2019s movement in the jet stream. His lockdown hair has caused much debate on the socials, but I\u2019m a big fan. Next stop Strictly please. Tomasz and Oti is the dream. Actually as Paperview in the comment box has just pointed out, Tomasz and Johannes is the dream. Now I will accept nothing less. There\u2019s a lot of Countryfile sheep tupping going on right now, courtesy of an extremely active Blue-faced Leicester. Adam Henson saying \u2018length\u2019 and \u2018milkiness\u2019 is bringing on a fever, but that might be the Covid. SCHAF KLAXON BRACE BRACE Evening all, and welcome back to this week\u2019s Strictly Results Show. Last night was Musicals Week, and it\u2019s a tough call on who the bottom two might be. I\u2019m reasonably confident that Ranvir won\u2019t be troubling the dance-off, but otherwise your guess is as good as mine. On the basis that sanity might prevail I\u2019m going for JJ and Jamie, with JJ to go. Kick-off is at 7.30pm, but we\u2019ll have a gentle Countryfile ramble to get us warmed up. See you in a bit! That went quickly, my fingers are barely warmed up. Thank you for joining in and being brilliant, please come back for tomorrow\u2019s Results Show at 7.30pm. Enjoy the rest of your Saturday, and I\u2019ll see you then! And that\u2019s it for the dancing! JJ and Jamie at the bottom of the leaderboard this evening, but it\u2019s possible that Bill might be in danger of ending up in the dance-off. I loved Ranvir and Maisie this evening, although I\u2019d also fling Bill a vote as I\u2019d love to see him in the final. HRVY doesn\u2019t need my imaginary support, he\u2019s got the kids and the nans. Scores: 8,8,8 - a total of 24 for Jamie and Karen. Craig wanted more technique in the Jive sections, but Jamie is an powerhouse of energy. Shirley loved the musicality and Jamie was quite light on his feet, although there was a misstep in the middle. Motsi loved the use of the props and Jamie needs to keep on working on the technique. There are only two weeks to go, Motsi, he\u2019s got two dances next week. I feel that ship has sailed. For some reason, both Jamie and Karen are dressed like they work in a Peugeot dealership. I\u2019m not entirely clear on the plot of Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie, but I\u2019m guessing his job flogging mid-range French cars is not why everybody\u2019s talking about him. The bits where Jamie moves furniture are great, but the actual Jive is a bit heavy. Also Karen stands in front of him for a chunk of it, so I can\u2019t see what his feet are doing. It\u2019s got a frantic energy which I rather love, but as a Jive it\u2019s a bit lacking and Jamie is visibly flagging by the end. And finally tonight it\u2019s JAMIE AND KAREN! This week they\u2019re dancing the Jive to \u2018Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie\u2019 from Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie, even though literally the only person talking about Jamie is Jamie. Last week\u2019s Tango put them in the bottom two, saved only by Clara\u2019s Jive issues. Interested to see what they\u2019ve got up their sleeve tonight, they\u2019re wrapping up the show so it\u2019s clearly not going to be a duffer. Scores: 9,10,10 - a total of 29 for HRVY and JNTT. Motsi loved how challenging the choreography, and if he\u2019d missed one step it would have crumbled. OK well he did actually, but Motsi thought it was the dance of the decade. Craig thought HRVY slightly missed the timing in a couple of places, but otherwise it\u2019s like looking in the mirror. Shirley thought Janette did her student proud, and HRVY carried on despite the mishap with his hat. Sparkly Hats! Drink! Despite having a little wobble at the bottom of the stairs, HRVY is looking very comfortable with this dance. He also looks like he\u2019s been dipped in glitter. Great work, tens all round? It\u2019s time for HRVY AND JNTT! Their Musicals Week dance is the American Smooth to \u2018One (Singular Sensation)\u2019 from A Chorus Line. It\u2019s quite a bouncy number for a Smooth, but I\u2019m not going to turn my nose up at a bit of traditional ballroom, god knows there\u2019s been little enough of that this year. Scores: 8,8,8 - a total of 24 for Bill and Oti. Shirley enjoyed how Bill lead the dance, even though he lost his balance at the end and it\u2019s A DIFFICULT DANCE FOR A MAN. Motsi thought Bill pulled it off, and she loved the details and Bill\u2019s posture and timing. Craig though there was a sticky moment but Bill had complete control and command and it was phantasmagorical. Very much enjoying Bill Bailey does Meat Loaf. Mostly this involves Oti\u2019s legs, but Bill is doing a nice job of providing a pole for her to dance round. Nice shaping and lots of drama, but a bit wobbly at the end. Next up it\u2019s BILL AND OTI! This week they\u2019re dancing the Argentine Tango to \u2018Phantom of the Opera\u2019 from Phantom of the Opera. Davood and Nadiya danced an Argentine to his in Musicals Week in 2017, and promptly got eliminated. This kind of doom-laden history makes me very uncomfortable, but if anyone can re-write Strictly history, it\u2019s Bill. Scores: 9, 10, 9 - a total of 28 for Maisie and Gorka. They actually look a bit disappointed. Craig loved the energy and musicality in a complex routine, they absolutely smashed it. Shirley was impressed by Maisie\u2019s timing and her foot position. Motsi loved how Maisie interpreted the music and she adored it. Maisie is wearing a different wig from Karen\u2019s wig, but it\u2019s equally wiggy and ridiculous, so DRINK. I\u2019m very here for Geeky Gorka though. Maisie is absolutely smashing this really quite complex Jive, although I\u2019d love more Jive basic and less running about. OOH, CGI MONSTER PLANT. It\u2019s time for MAISIE AND GORKA! This week they\u2019re dancing the Jive to \u2018Little Shop of Horrors\u2019 from Little Shop of Horrors. This was originally a film, so DRINK . Mark Wright and Karen Hauer did a Jive to this in 2014, which I watched earlier. Karen had a really weird wig on, but I don\u2019t remember much about Mark\u2019s Jive. I\u2019d kind of forgotten Mark, if I\u2019m honest. Scores: 9,9,9 - a total of 27 for Ranvir and Giovanni. Motsi feels Ranvir has finally come into herself and it was magical. Craig loved the storytelling and it was totally real and believable, although the run away was a bit messy. Shirley was captivated by the whole performance, it was like poetry in motion. Lovely fleckerl too, the best she\u2019s seen on Strictly. Well this is actually quite captivating, and Ranvir has the most gorgeous ballroom frame. Lovely spinning and storytelling, and my first goosebumps dance of the series. All rather moving and beautiful. Loved that. Next up it\u2019s RANVIR AND GIOVANNI! Their Musicals Week turn is the Viennese Waltz to \u2018She Used To Be Mine\u2019 from Waitress The Musical. Ranvir and Giovanni have decided to capitalise on the romance factor, but after last week\u2019s pretty safe American Smooth they might need to up their game, particularly as this isn\u2019t a well-known song. Risky. Scores: 6,7,7 - a total of 20 for JJ and Amy. Shirley was impressed with how long JJ\u2019s legs were, and he executed the simple choregraphy spectacularly. Motsi enjoyed JJ\u2019s smile and acting skills, but he needs to work on the stopping moments. Craig thought it was too stop and start for him and the basic Charleston needed more kick, but the jumps had great height. Very disappointed that JJ has embraced his inner Dick Van Dyke rather than The Child Catcher, but here we are. More sick-making CGI, but JJ is actually doing a not-bad job of this. It\u2019s not the most complex of Charlestons and JJ\u2019s timing and transitions are a bit iffy in places, but his footwork is good and he\u2019s giving the characterisation his best shot. Lovely posture too, and nice to see another side to JJ. First up tonight is JJ AND AMY! This week they\u2019re dancing the Charleston to \u2018Chitty Bang Bang\u2019 from the musical of the same name, even though it was clearly a movie first (DRINK). Their campaign of Latin Avoidance continues; we may make it all the way to the Grand Final without us ever finding out if JJ has any kind of hip action. This feels not entirely in the spirit of Strictly, if you ask me \u2013 at least do a Cha Cha and let Shirley bang on about how hard it is for a man. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a black tube with a weird neck collar thing, Claudia in a fabulous sparkly white tux. Out come the judges! Motsi is wearing a bouncy castle. As tonight is a feem week, so we get a bonus pro dance. Perhaps inspired by Craig\u2019s Hello Dolly drag turn last year, it\u2019s a Priscilla, Queen of the Desert special. Muscle vest Giovanni is quite...something. I could live a thousand years and I don\u2019t think anything will make me happier than seeing Johannes, Gorka and Giovanni in drag. We thought we\u2019d seen Peak Johannes with the catwalk routine last year, but it turns out he was just getting warmed up. Forget tonight\u2019s show, just hook this up to my veins for an hour. So much lavish headgear. Drink everything. Mix a cocktail. Pop a cork. Tonight\u2019s show starts with Andrew Lloyd-Webber talking about how badly the theatre industry has been hammered by Covid. Tonight\u2019s show is a tribute to the people who are waiting in the wings to get back on stage. Also presumably AL-W needs a new bungalow. Happy birthday to Ethan in the comment box, he\u2019s 17 today. May your year be full of sparkle and joy. Tonight\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo \u2013 a swig of something mulled for any occurrence of the following: Musicals that were movies first and thus belong in Movie Week (still dying on this hill) Lavish headgear Three tens Mentions of feet Early references to TWO DANCES I was also going to include a drink for any musicals I\u2019ve never seen on stage, but I\u2019ve looked at the list and I haven\u2019t seen any of them. Feel free to drink anyway, it\u2019s been that kind of week. Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing liveblog! It\u2019s MUSICALS WEEK, which usually means a hot mess of giant props and superfluous backing dancers, but this year we may be spared both. In 2020 we count our tiny blessings. After Clara and Aljaz\u2019s exit last week, we\u2019re down to six couples, with two more to ditch before the Grand Final on 19th December. By rights it should be JJ and Jamie, but it\u2019s been a strange year, anything could happen. Curtain up is at 7.25pm, so settle in in for a socially distanced trip to the West End. Tonight\u2019s show is barely an hour long, which is a gift to the Covid-stricken liveblogger. See you in a bit!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
