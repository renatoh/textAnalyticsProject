Professor Griffin is well versed in the ways of vibration. While based at the University of Southampton's Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, he also chairs the British Standards Institution's subcommittee on human response to mechanical vibration and shock. He can boast authorship of more than 250 technical reports, including a 1990 best-selling handbook of human vibration that bears the no-nonsense title Handbook of Human Vibration. The reading-while-shaking study appeared in 1994 in the journal Applied Ergonomics. It begins with one of those I-dare-you-to-NOT-read-this lead sentences: \"Text from a newspaper was read by seated subjects during exposure to fore-and-aft and lateral whole-body vibration.\" The rest of the document is mere elaboration. It describes the newspaper, the subjects who were seated, the seats, and the vibration, then discusses what it all might mean. The reading text consists of photocopied leading articles from different editions of the Times - 68 of them, each on a sheet of A4 paper. A clipboard held 68 of these sheets. Eight men and eight women volunteered to sit, in chairs, for this experiment. All were between the ages of 18 and 31, in good health, and practised at reading English-language printed matter. All were shaken. A one-metre-stroke horizontal vibrator produced the shaking. It was controlled by a computer that delivered the wave motion in 30-second doses at a variety of frequencies, at four different magnitudes. In some sessions, the seats were shaken forth-and-back; in others, from side to side. The scientists measured how much reading the readers accomplished while being shaken in 56 various ways. As with many phenomena involving vibration, the effects came on rather suddenly as the shaking rate approached a crucial range. The worst performance came when people tried to read while they were shaking fore-to-aft at about four hertz. Griffin and Hayward explain that this is largely due to the vibration of the clipboard, \"owing to the dynamic response of the shoulders and arms at, or near, this frequency\". The difficulty in reading, they concluded, \"was greatly influenced by the motion of the reading material,\" and was exacerbated by vibration transmitted from the chair's backrest to the person's head and arms. The report's relentlessly passive voice acts as a dampening force on the enthusiasm of anyone who makes it to the end. A happy acknowledgement awaits anyone who is not too worn down to take in its significance: \"This research was supported by London Underground Ltd.\" (Thanks to Mark Benecke for bringing this to my attention.) \u00b7 Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly magazine Annals of Improbable Research (www.improbable.com) and organiser of the Ig Nobel Prize"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
