The Fab Four, it was widely known, already had their own company called Apple Corps. (Ironically, Jobs admitted to naming his company as a tribute to the Beatles.) The result of the suit was a huge cash settlement and a promise that the Apple logo and name would only be used for computers -- and never for a music company.\" Update: Now The Mercury News has a piece, too. Comment: It's hard to imagine that Apple launched its music services without due consideration of the terms of its promise to Apple Corps. Perhaps having $4bn in the bank means it doesn't have to care, but some of us assumed Apple might well have done the obvious thing and quietly negotiated a settlement first...."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
