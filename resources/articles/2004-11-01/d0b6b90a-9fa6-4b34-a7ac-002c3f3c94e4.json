But you can learn a lot if you keep your hairnet jammed up against t'vestry wall, as Victoria Wood once noted in a sketch, and the reaction to this week's publication of Women Bishops in the Church of England?, the C of E report suggesting the first ordinations could come by 2009, did provide one of those strangely vivid glimpses of the future. In fact, the moment you hear the General Synod is gearing up for another of its endlessly alluring debates on the matter - this one predicted to last up to four years - it's not beyond most of us to indulge in a little soothsaying. And so to 2005. The opening of General Synod discussions on the matter is best described as lively. \"If God had meant women to be bishops, he'd have given us reason,\" notes one protester's placard. \"Abused children for Women Bishops,\" reads that of an opponent. Early doors, one progressive bishop argues that women are already accepted to the priesthood and the Anglican prayerbook makes no significant separation between \"the Orders of bishops, priests and deacons\". \"Nor does it mention anything about their driving skills,\" interjects an opposer. \"It is patently incomplete.\" Quite the coming man, observe the conservatives, who mark him out as a possible future archbishop. To counter his testimony, however, a lay witness is called to explain why, with its stained-glass ceiling, the church feels less accepting of her than her workplace. (She is later ducked as a witch.) Elsewhere, meanwhile, journalists opening the joint US-UK dossier that lays out the case for an invasion of Iran discover the lessons of Iraq have been learned. This time the document is merely a copy of the Bible. \"It's nice to feel relevant,\" notes an aide to the Archbishop of Canterbury, but the female bishops' debate means no one senior is available to discuss the matter publicly. As Synod discussions leak into the second year, a Mori poll that invites respondents to name a central tenet of the C of E produces intriguing results. Top answers are the ostracism of gays and suppression of women. Next most popular is \"arguing\". Don't knows number 20%, and 4% believe the church may be engaged in some kind of unspecified charitable work but doesn't like to talk about it. Three years into the debate, and the Church Society - the conservative evangelical fringe group and the most ardent opposer of women bishops - has been forced to make a few changes in order to prove its adherence to scripture is nothing if not consistent. Each of its members now owns several slaves, whom they beat regularly on the advice of Luke 12:47. In a bid to raise awareness, one of their number appears on Mastermind, offering Bibilical injunctions as his specialist subject. Sadly, though able to answer in arcane detail questions on standardised bushel sizes and the order in which one should feed one's animals and slaves, he is unable to place \"love thy neighbour\" and loses out to a taxi driver from Hull (specialist subject: Ben Elton musicals). Finally, just in time for Christmas 2008, the General Synod decides on a \"Third Province\", a church within a church to cater for those who cannot accept the authority of women bishops. There is an additional stained-glass ceiling clause to prevent a female becoming Archbishop of Canterbury. In what way can this possibly be logical, ask critics? \"Under God,\" comes the official theological reply. However, concerned by dwindling congregations - and the baffling news that the slide seems to have accelerated in the past three years - the General Synod schedules a series of debates on the matter, to be held after the series of debates in which the timetable for the introduction of women bishops will be discussed. There is an odd silence all the while from the Third Province (and if there is something unsettling about that name, no one can put their finger on it, at least not at this point). It later emerges that they have drawn up plans to erect walls and moats around their churchyards, accessed only by drawbridge if the approved congregant provides the current password. As for the turn of the decade, well, it's fair to say that in this atmosphere the Second Coming takes most people by surprise. Naturally, I won't spoil it for you.
