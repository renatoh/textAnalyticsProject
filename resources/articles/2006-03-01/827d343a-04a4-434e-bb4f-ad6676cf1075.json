A submission by the England and Wales Cricket Board to stage the event is among overtures from 15 International Cricket Council member boards to run major competitions between 2007 and 2015. The ICC received a hand-delivered submission from Australia and New Zealand yesterday, aiming to host the 2011 or 2015 World Cup. Among the submissions received are bids from Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, United Arab Emirates and West Indies to host ICC Champions Trophies. England, Malaysia, Scotland, South Africa, Sri Lanka, United Arab Emirates and West Indies are all hoping for a potential Twenty20 event. Ireland, meanwhile, are among four countries hoping to host Division One of the ICC's World Cricket League or the ICC World Cup Qualifier (formerly ICC Trophy). ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said: \"This is the first time we have run such a comprehensive submissions process and we have been delighted by the positive response from so many of our members. \"We have been impressed by the quality of many of the bids, and they will present the ICC board with a good range of options when it meets to review the scheduling and hosting of these events in March.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
