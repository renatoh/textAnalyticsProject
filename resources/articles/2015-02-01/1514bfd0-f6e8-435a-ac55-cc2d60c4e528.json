This is not necessarily for the recruitment of players, mind you. Although there are deals in place for the Tottenham Hotspur winger Aaron Lennon and Dame N\u2019Doye, Lokomotiv Moscow\u2019s Senegal striker, subject to personal terms, the one definite arrival at their Cottingham training base is Mike Phelan as Bruce\u2019s assistant. Hull have been without a managerial No2 since Steve Agnew switched to Middlesbrough before Christmas. Phelan, Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s former sidekick at Manchester United whose most recent post was a brief one at Norwich City, played alongside Bruce at Carrow Road and Old Trafford although Bruce was keen to stress they are not overly matey. \u201cMick was here for the game and he\u2019s a vastly experienced man. It\u2019s a new voice, somebody fresh with different ideas. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be a big help to us. I\u2019ve known him a long time. I wouldn\u2019t say I was pals with him but he\u2019s the right man at the right time. He should give everyone a lift,\u201d Bruce said. How Hull and Bruce could do with one. They have taken only 20 points from their last 28 Premier League matches and the most worrying aspect of this defeat was its submissive nature. The better team for the opening 40 minutes, they fell away badly thereafter. For those who witnessed their performance in the 3-0 defeat at West Ham a fortnight ago it was Groundhog Day. However, Bruce insisted last season\u2019s FA Cup finalists will win the survival scrap they find themselves in. \u201cI don\u2019t fear for my job. It\u2019s part and parcel, it\u2019s my turn,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this game long enough to roll up my sleeves. The one thing I\u2019m not going to do is chuck it in. \u201cI\u2019ve had a great two and a half years here. We\u2019ve been badly hit by injuries and we had too many flagging towards the end. We\u2019ve got enough here to stay up and I\u2019m convinced we will do.\u201d The need for points led Bruce to recall four players from the treatment room. Although he considered it a risk worth taking, two of them, Andrew Robertson and Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez, were culpable of giving away possession to Newcastle for their first two goals. Sumptuous long-range finishes from R\u00e9my Cabella and Sammy Ameobi followed. At the other end Abel Hern\u00e1ndez and Nikica Jelavic failed to improve a woeful run of a dozen blanks in 16 matches although it took extraordinary bumble-footedness from the Croatian to bodge a 52nd-minute chance at an open goal. A point worse off than they were at the same juncture of their 2009\u201110 relegation season, Hull travel to Manchester City next weekend. Robertson, the Scotland full-back who apologised to his team-mates at half-time for his error, said: \u201cOnce you are in the relegation zone you can\u2019t set any target. You have just to take it game by game and, if we want to stay in this league, we have to start winning.\u201d That is what John Carver managed for the first time in the week he had his role upgraded. After Yoann Gouffran became the ninth Newcastle substitute to score this season Alan Pardew\u2019s successor as head coach said: \u201cI\u2019m known as the \u2018grumpy one\u2019 because when Alan was here I was getting around people, I was the bad cop. But I\u2019m quite controlled now. If I\u2019m brutally honest, my emotions are always in my face.\u201d At least one managerial son of the north-east is smiling.
