An obvious choice is Quadrophenia, but the more curious should check out odder fare, like The Flesh And Blood Show, directed by former DOY projectionist Peter Walker, the dour thriller Jigsaw and John Mackenzie's Made, a social drama featuring folkie Roy Harper. The centrepiece is Brighton Rock Unseen, a tribute to Graham Greene's original novel and the iconic 1947 movie it spawned. Duke Of York's, Sun to 29 Aug; picturehouses.co.uk Chichester Film Festival Opening with Sylvain Chomet's lovely, Jacques Tati-inspired animation The Illusionist, the 19th Chichester Film Festival is bent on bringing magic of all kinds to the screen. Aside from previews of upcoming US, European, Asian and British flicks \u2013 including Stephen Frears's light but lively comedy Tamara Drewe, Nick Moran's harrowing abuse memoir The Kid and Paul Andrew Williams's controversial hoodie horror Cherry Tree Lane \u2013 the festival offers tributes to directors including Eric Rohmer, Joseph Strick and Akira Kurosawa, with a small season paying homage to housewife's favourite Colin Firth. There's also a rare chance to catch Craig McCall's lovely Jack Cardiff doc Cameraman on the big screen, where it belongs. And if such cineaste matters don't appeal, head to the cathedral for tonight's free open-air screening of My Fair Lady, starring Audrey Hepburn. Chichester Cinema, Thu to 5 Sep; chichestercinema.org Flickstock, Belfast The art of the rock movie is celebrated in this brief but wide-ranging season. Julien Temple's The Filth And The Fury traces the short, sputtering career of the Sex Pistols, while the brightly burning candle of 60s Britain is documented in Peter Whitehead's Tonite Let's All Make Love In London. Reggae gets a shout out in the ragged but visceral, pre-punk indie The Harder They Come, and Madchester is covered in the wonderful 24 Hour Party People. Best of all, though, is Richard Loncraine's gritty Slade In Flame, the most depressing movie ever made by a pop band, starring Noddy Holder and the boys in a story of rags to rags via the most fleeting fame imaginable. A cautionary tale, with an atypical Slade soundtrack that Oasis seem hellbent on rewriting forever. Queen's Film Theatre, Fri to 26 Aug; queensfilmtheatre.com The Cineroleum, London When is a drive-in not quite a drive-in? When it's a derelict petrol station forecourt, apparently. Running for four nights a week, for four weeks only, this bespoke cinema space \u2013 created with found and donated materials, all hopefully non-flammable \u2013 will provide a suitably offbeat roster of movies for those attracted by the setting. Cult is the keyword here, with screenings of Rebel Without A Cause and Barbarella to kick off, followed by rare airings of Steven Spielberg's Duel and Terrence Malick's Badlands. Genre cinema gets a look in with a special B-movie night, and after a preview of Fritz Lang's restored sci-fi milestone Metropolis, the season wraps with Carol Reed's The Third Man. Clerkenwell Road, EC1, Fri to 12 Sep; cineroleum.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
