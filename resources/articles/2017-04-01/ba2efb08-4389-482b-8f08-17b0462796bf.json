Fowler staggeringly four-putted the 18th hole of his third round on Saturday, contributing to a double bogey and the handing of a three-stroke lead to Kang Sung-hoon with 18 holes to go. Fowler, who had also dropped a shot at the 17th, was eight under par through 14 holes of round three, rendering his 67 something of an anti-climax. Conspiracy theorists may suggest Fowler actually does not want to win on the wrong week; the first major of the year is within touching distance, after all. Fowler\u2019s 22 birdies through 54 holes is a personal record on the PGA Tour. \u201cI probably have to get to 30 to bridge that gap,\u201d he admitted. Kang, seeking to claim the Masters berth that would come with Houston glory, completed a 71 to move to 17 under par. Despite the evidence provided by Fowler\u2019s early third-round surge, this event is now the Korean\u2019s to lose. Context as to his Houston form is provided by the fact 71 was his worst round in three days by six shots. \u201cI\u2019ll keep on playing my game. I really don\u2019t care what the others do,\u201d insisted Kang. \u201cIf I qualify for the Masters, I\u2019ll think about it. Even if I think about it before, it\u2019s going to happen or not. Why do I want to think about that? I\u2019m so tired right now. I have no power to think about anything.\u201d Luke Donald, who had earlier produced successive 71s, slipped to a third round of 76. Donald\u2019s compatriot Chris Wood signed for a 71 and two-under aggregate while Justin Rose, so prominent in the early stages of the tournament, is at minus five after a 73. Rose has Andy Sullivan for company on that total after the Nuneaton man carded his finest round of the week, a 67. Sunday\u2019s biggest challenge in Houston may relate to the weather. With a storm forecast, tournament organisers have already decided to implement a two-tee final round start. Competitors will also play in threes as opposed to the standard two-balls for competition conclusions. The possibility of a Monday finish, as would be readily considered elsewhere, is complicated by what would be a move into Masters week. Charley Hull is four shots off the lead after two rounds of the first women\u2019s major of the year, the ANA Inspiration, in California. The 21-year-old from Kettering made a second-round 72; the American Lexi Thompson leads on eight under par."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
