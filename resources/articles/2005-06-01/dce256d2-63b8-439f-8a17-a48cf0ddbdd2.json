I replied that the receipt of such a telephone call was unlikely. The Prime Minister and I never had a special relationship, but we were once on lunching terms. There was the time, which the sports agent Jon Holmes reminded me of recently, when I thanked Jon for introducing me to Gary Lineker and Holmes replied: 'But you introduced me on the same occasion to Tony Blair.' Lineker was contributing to The Observer at the time and said: 'I find this writing difficult.' To which I replied: 'My football isn't too hot.' Those were innocent days, before the invasion of Iraq. At all events, my advice to the Prime Minister would be, first, to cease crowing when talking to his French counterparts, and second, (during the UK's presidency of the European Union July-December) to take advantage of the fallout from the French referendum to call an urgent inquiry into the economic governance of the eurozone. Since the constitutional treaty is in such trouble, there may yet be a chance to introduce some revisions to previous treaties, and to save the eurozone from its in-built monetarist and deflationary tendencies. But this should be done diplomatically, and it has to be said that New Labour politicians do not win triple-A ratings for delicacy in handling Europe. There is nothing new about this. Fifty years ago Russell Bretherton, our man at the Messina conference (the crucial stepping-stone to the Treaty of Rome in 1957) observed: 'The future treaty you are discussing has no chance of being agreed; if it was agreed, it would have no chance of being ratified; and if it were ratified, it would have no chance of being applied. And if it was applied, it would be totally unacceptable to Britain. You speak of agriculture, which we don't like, of power over customs, which we take exception to, and institutions, which frighten us.' The rest is history, with a little geography thrown in. Agriculture is still not liked. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor have been linking the issue of agricultural reform with the infamous British budget rebate - or abatement, as Lord Kinnock reminds us we should call it. Yes, at one moment the so-called rebate is 'not negotiable'; at another, hints are dropped that, if the French slaughtered their sacred cows (as it were), there might be some scope. But the essential problem is that, by joining what we then called the Common Market so late, we were never in any position to dictate the rules. Even the budget rebate, usually attributed to Margaret Thatcher but in fact the work of Lords Carrington and Gilmour (respectively Foreign Secretary and Deputy Foreign Secretary during the key negotiation), was at first turned down by Thatcher during a heated session at Chequers. It was only when Carrington and Gilmour 'spun' the agreement as a triumph for Thatcher that she accepted it. As Gilmour observed in Dancing With Dogma: 'Her objection was to the fact of the agreement, not to its terms. That was not because we had succeeded where she had failed. It was because, to her, the grievance was more valuable than its removal.' And however strongly Britain feels about the budget rebate, the fact is that it looks pretty odd to outsiders that Britain is pleading with the US and others to cough up more money for Africa while in effect being mean about financial assistance closer to home - namely to new members of the European Community in eastern Europe. The government doesn't seem to ask itself how this squares with boasts that Britain now has the best economy since Roman times - just as, whatever the rights and wrongs of the case for more US money for foreign aid, to link its case with the idea of a 'payback' for Blair's support of Bush over Iraq is offensive to most of us, indeed little short of obscene. It is, incidentally, characteristic of our Prime Minister that he should have thought he had any serious influence on the policies of the US Congress in these matters, however welcome it makes him when he goes there. Blair would have had more understanding from the French about the rebate if he had not first advised Jacques Chirac against holding a referendum, then announced one for himself, thereby making it difficult for the French President to avoid such a course. If all had gone well for Chirac with his referendum, then something might have been on offer, on the rebate front, to help Blair through his referendum. But it's goodbye to all that, and Blair's place in history will now comprise the Iraq war, three election wins and - if he has his way - 10 years as Prime Minister (always assuming the internal emails with regard to the Attorney General's advice on the war remain unleaked). Throughout the main countries of Europe we now face a difficult period of 'muddling through' in a bitter atmosphere of ill feeling and recrimination. The elite lost touch with the people, and have been found out for their ambivalent dealings with Brussels. As Mary Harney, Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister, said at the meeting of the National Forum on Europe: 'You can't \"slag\" Europe six days of the week and then, on the seventh day, ask people to embrace it.' The fact is that the Big Four of the EU are governed by rulers on the way out. One's sense of history (or perhaps one's wishful thinking) suggests that Europe is down but not out, whereas Blair, Chirac, Schr\u00f6der and Berlusconi are heading for the exit. It will probably take a new group of leaders to pick up the pieces. There are some optimists in diplomatic circles who, for all their disappointment with Blair, hope that during the UK presidency he will finally rise to the occasion, but the omens are hardly encouraging. At the Dublin meeting of the National Forum on Europe, the point was made that 10 of the 25 EU member nations had ratified the constitutional treaty (representing 49 per cent of the population); yet the result from France, the driving force behind 'Europe' for all these years, was devastating. Even in Ireland - the country where in 1979 the EMS (European Monetary System) was jokingly referred to as standing for Easy Money Soon - the atmosphere does not appear to be one where the elite can be confident of winning a referendum on the constitutional treaty. Yet Ireland is a nation whose economy has manifestly benefited from EU money, and whose economy has visibly prospered. Even if the Celtic tiger has slowed down from the hectic 10 per cent per annum growth rates of the second half of the 1990s (5 per cent growth feels like recession, joked one politician) and there are concerns about a property price bubble, the sense of economic wellbeing is palpable. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development observes that 'potential growth is estimated to be at around 5 per cent - a rate that is still dwarfing the performance of most other euro area countries'. Of course, Ireland itself is dwarfed by the rest of the eurozone, accounting, as it does, for just 2 per cent or so of the eurozone's gross domestic product (it's not so long since it was 1 per cent). And Irish economic policymakers must feel a little nervous when international business magazines pick the economy out as a star performer. Such commendations have an unfortunate history. Nevertheless, so far, so good. On the other hand, the major economies of the eurozone have been impeded not only by the ultra-cautious policies of the European Central Bank, but also by (at least until recently) the restrictive policies of the stability and growth pact - a pact that was fatefully stitched together at an EU finance ministers' meeting in 1996 in the very Dublin Castle where the National Forum on Europe met last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
