Boochani, who has been publishing a vivid and remarkable diary on the closure of the Manus camp over the past week, won the award in the print, online and multimedia category for his work last year for the Guardian and the Saturday Paper. Guardian Australia\u2019s Calla Wahlquist won the award for reporting of Indigenous issues for her penetrating coverage of the death of the Indigenous woman Ms Dhu in Western Australia. The judges said Wahlquist\u2019s coverage was \u201csecond to none\u201d. \u201cHer reporting led the way in achieving social justice for the family of Miss Dhu. We can\u2019t undo what happened but her journalism helped to keep it in people\u2019s minds and focused public attention on this appalling death in custody.\u201d Boochani has been indefatigable in his reportage from the Australian-run detention centre. In a pre-recorded video, he told the audience at the awards ceremony in Sydney. \u201cIt is such a big honour for me, that you have recognised my work and my job in Manus prison camp. When I have started my work on this island, I felt that this is my mission and this is my duty. After four years when I get this award and this recognition, it is very important for me.\u201d The judges said Boochani\u2019s work \u201chits all the criteria in spades\u201d. \u201cFurthermore, his work, delivered under very difficult circumstances, is powerful, courageous and extraordinary. Its currency, its emotion, its credibility all combine to make it really special.\u201d Ben Doherty, Guardian Australia\u2019s immigration reporter, accepted the award on Behrouz\u2019s behalf. \u201cThis is an extraordinary honour to be accepting this on behalf of Behrouz, and it couldn\u2019t be more timely,\u201d he said. \u201cBehrouz filed for us about two hours ago: Manus is on the verge of meltdown and Behrouz\u2019s future swings on the next few days, but still he writes on. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I have met, in my life, a journalist with the commitment, the belief and the passion for our vocation than Behrouz Boochani. \u201cBehrouz, rightly, sees himself as a working journalist on Manus Island, whose job it is to be bear witness to the injustices and the violence and the privation of offshore detention. He does that not just for himself but he does it for all the men on Manus, and he does it for us, for Australians, to know what is happening in that place.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Nauru files reporting team were a finalist in the print, online and multimedia category. The other winners were the cartoonist Cathy Wilcox of the Age and Sydney Morning Herald, in the cartoon category; Kate Geraghty for her pictures from Mosul; Sarah Dingle and Wendy Carlisle from ABC Radio for Death in Kalgoorlie; and Elise Potaka, Tim Anastasi and Joel Stillone from SBS Viceland for \u201cForced to Marry\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
