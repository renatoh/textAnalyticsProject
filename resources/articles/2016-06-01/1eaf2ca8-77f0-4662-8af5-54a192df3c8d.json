Much stress is laid, in every sense, on his curved spine, which is held up to the light and which informs the physical image of Ralph Fiennes\u2019s performance. But, although the production is based on the implied tension between the Richard of history and the one of Shakespeare\u2019s imagination, the result is an unusually sober reading that has momentary insights but which loses something of the play\u2019s malign wit. Shakespeare\u2019s Richard is, above all, a consummate actor. But, although Fiennes\u2019s dark-suited Richard compares himself to the shape-changing Proteus, he shows little delight in role-playing: he might, to all intents and purposes, be a grim-visaged banker systematically eradicating all obstacles between himself and and the top job. If there is a key to Fiennes\u2019s interpretation, it lies in an assertive masculinity that displays a ruthless contempt for women. In the wooing of Lady Anne, Fiennes grabs her between the thighs and slaps her face. Revealingly, Fiennes gives Buckingham a stare of implacable hatred when, in their attempt to cajole the London citizens, he is playfully accused of \u201ceffeminate remorse\u201d. And Fiennes\u2019s Richard actually rapes Queen Elizabeth in the act of seeking her daughter\u2019s hand. Fiennes gives us a Richard for whom people, women especially, are playthings of his perverted will. But, while this reading is psychologically consistent and executed with Fiennes\u2019s customary skill, it sacrifices Richard\u2019s irony and duplicity. A classic example occurs in the encounter with the young Prince Edward where the line \u201cSo wise so young, they say, do ne\u2019er live long\u201d is delivered to the boy\u2019s face as a visible threat. This is a Richard who makes little attempt to mask his intentions and who, almost always, means what he says. A chilling exception comes in the moment \u2013 the best in the evening \u2013 where Fiennes, having been persuaded to accept the crown, smiles benignly at the audience and then raises a fist ominously clenched. I admired Fiennes\u2019s Richard without ever feeling the actor enlisted us in his villainy. But he is surrounded by strong performances, especially from the women. Vanessa Redgrave\u2019s Queen Margaret is the most surprising in that she turns this relic of the Lancastrian regime from a scolding harridan into a soft-spoken, pathetically demented figure clutching a baby doll whom she proceeds to feed from the bottle. Aislin McGuckin also registers vigorously the fire and anger of the ousted Queen Elizabeth, Susan Engel seethes with silvery horror as Richard\u2019s mother and Joanna Vanderham turns Lady Anne into a bewildered pawn in Richard\u2019s game. Hildegard Bechtler\u2019s effective design is dominated by a giant crown suspended above the stage, and by skulls that accumulate on the back wall as the death count steadily rises. The play is straightforwardly presented with sharply delineated performances from Scott Handy as a meditative Clarence desperately pleading for his life, Finbar Lynch as a coldly calculating Buckingham and Mark Hadfield as both a conscience-stricken killer and one of Richard\u2019s bureaucratic henchmen. But, while Goold\u2019s production drives the action forward, the references to Richard\u2019s disinterment, which bookend the evening, strike me as a red herring. The Richard of history and Shakespeare\u2019s play are entirely different entities; and I would have liked more of the bustling energy and chameleon-like changeability of the latter whom Hazlitt, in writing of Edmund Kean\u2019s Richard, described as \u201ca princely hypocrite\u201d and a born actor always conscious of his mental superiority. At the Almeida, London, until 6 August. Box office: 020-7359 4404"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
