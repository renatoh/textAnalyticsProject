I would like to take this opportunity to say sorry for misleading Onlineblog's readers. NTL is still at hard at work, redefining the term \"bad service\". Calling to report a fault tonight I discovered it was impossible to speak to a human being and - better yet - their call handling system would disconnect you after delivering a message that essentially said \"whatever your fault, wait and see - things might improve\". They didn't, it's still broken, and I'm still fuming. My tip: think really, really hard about taking any of their services, unless you get some kind of twisted pleasure out of waiting in call queues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
