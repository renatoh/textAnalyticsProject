I think it\u2019s really exciting to be shortlisted. I\u2019m really pumped to be able to be there and to celebrate alongside everyone.\u201d Gallagher talks in a cheerful stream, words hurling themselves out of her at downhill pace. If she can sound this excited about talking to the Observer, heaven only knows what might happen on Sunday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible year,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore the Games there was no coverage of our sport at all. Now it seems there\u2019s starting to be a bit of a spotlight on visually-impaired sport, on women\u2019s sport, on winter sport, and that\u2019s really exciting for me.\u201d Sunday\u2019s ceremony, coming a week after she and Evans flew to Austria to start in earnest their preparations for a new season, brings down the curtain on an unforgettable year for the 29-year-old, who as a result of her success in Sochi was made an MBE in June. \u201cI never even aspired to do anything like that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a real honour to be awarded something like that from outside the sport, by the monarchy. And then [in April] we got to meet the Irish president and the Queen and she held my medal and that was just really crazy for me. It was such a bizarre experience and just so different to anything we\u2019d been involved in and very special for us. I think those two occasions were definitely something that I\u2019m really going to treasure.\u201d But as an outsider perhaps the most unlikely thing about her year is that, before she started being repeatedly pestered by royals, as she packed her bags and prepared to leave Sochi she had considered her Paralympics a failure. And perhaps understandably: of her five events she completed only two, and in the one she didn\u2019t win she finished last. \u201cBasically, the only good thing that happened in the Paralympics was us winning that gold medal \u2013 every other race went terrible. I\u2019ve never had a race series in my life like that,\u201d she says. \u201cWe always start off maybe a bit rubbish, but never like losing the event. After the downhill my heart was broken, I didn\u2019t know if I could compete again. And then Charlotte came and gave me a bit of tough love. We decided, you know, we literally couldn\u2019t do any worse. \u201cThen we just got hit by bad luck. My feet came off the skis a couple of times, and once I fell when we were leading. But whatever happened in those other races I couldn\u2019t have put any more effort in. I put in my whole heart. \u201cWhen we were in Sochi we didn\u2019t really think we\u2019d done that well, and it\u2019s taken me a wee while to come to terms with it. But before the Games our ambition was just to feel good about our performances. We wanted to get to the bottom and feel: \u2018That was a really good run, and we didn\u2019t hold back.\u2019 And that\u2019s kind of what we felt.\u201d Once this weekend is over Gallagher\u2019s life promises to become a little more serene, as she returns to the Alps and preparation for the world championships, to be held in Panorama, Canada, in February and March. \u201cThe worlds have a really special vibe to them because there\u2019s not so much media, and it\u2019s not quite the juggernaut that is the Games,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really nice event where everyone competes to be the best they can be.\u201d It is as if she is both revelling in the attention that her success in Sochi has brought, and quite looking forward to it coming to an end. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not something I would choose, but it\u2019s something that seems to be part of the job now, of being a winner. And you want to be the winner,\u201d Gallagher says. \u201cIt\u2019s been brilliant to be on television, showing our sport. Not being interviewed \u2013 I don\u2019t care about the fame or anything like that \u2013 but I do care that young people get to see disability in a different way, not in a negative way but a really positive way. It\u2019s hard to equate the word blindness with skiing at 95mph. It can be hard for people to understand that, I think. But maybe if children know because of me that, if they want to be a ski racer, that it\u2019s possible for them, well, that\u2019d be good.\u201d THE DETAILS The venue Glasgow\u2019s SSE Hydro, which staged gymnastics and netball at the Commonwealth Games and gigs by Beyonc\u00e9 and Miley Cyrus.

Plus Scottish cycling great Sir Chris Hoy\u2019s lifetime achievement award. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see my name alongside the likes of Sir Steve Redgrave, David Beckham, Seve Ballesteros and others who\u2019ve received this honour,\u201d he said. What we won\u2019t see An awkward satellite-delayed presentation to a poolside Andy Murray in Miami. Last year\u2019s winner is not on the shortlist.
