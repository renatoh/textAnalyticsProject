Two others were injured. Tasmanian retiree Rod Patterson, 58 and a 24-year-old security guard from Hampton Park who are both recovering at Royal Melbourne Hospital. Police shot Shire Ali and he was taken to hospital under guard, but died shortly afterwards. Police are treating the attack as a terrorist incident. Shire Ali was known to counter-terrorism authorities at state and national level. Shire Ali\u2019s passport had been cancelled in 2015 when Asio assessed he had intentions to travel to Syria to fight with Islamic State extremists. Authorities were not actively monitoring him before the incident. Joint counter-terrorism investigators were raiding two addresses in Werribee and Meadows Heights on Saturday morning. Shire Ali had a history of minor drug, theft and driving offences. He had migrated from Somalia to Australia in the 1990s, police said. Shire Ali drove a 4x4 laden with gas cylinders. Witnesses said the man drove the vehicle outside the Target centre about 4.20pm. As the car went up in flames, he attempted to stab people and fought with police and bystanders. The police officer who shot the man in the chest, had been out of the police academy for three months. People could be seen trying to help the police, using a shopping trolley and a chair to fend off the man.
