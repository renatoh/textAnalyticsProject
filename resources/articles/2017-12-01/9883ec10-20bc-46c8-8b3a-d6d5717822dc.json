The demands from HMRC hinge on inheritance tax rules that require tax to be paid upfront on large gifts. Party political donations, as well as donations to charities, are usually exempt, but HMRC has said that does not apply to individuals who donated to the referendum campaign. Eurosceptics have argued they will bear more of a tax burden for donations to the leave campaign than remain supporters, because the large donations were more likely to come from wealthy individuals or businessmen, not listed companies. HMRC dismissed the suggestion that the tax demands were evidence of bias, saying it applied the law equally across all donors. Others derided the complaints as pleas for \u201cbungs\u201d for wealthy donors. Those reported by the Telegraph to have received payment demands in the last fortnight include the banker and former Conservative party co-chair Peter Cruddas, worth a reported \u00a3750m, who gave \u00a3900,000 to Vote Leave. The former Ukip donor Arron Banks, who donated \u00a38.1m to his Leave.EU campaign group, told the Telegraph the \u00a32m bill he had received in the past month was the \u201crevenge of the establishment\u201d. Another who has received a payment demand is Robert Edmiston, a millionaire motor trader worth a reported \u00a3440m, who donated \u00a3850,000 to Vote Leave and \u00a3150,000 to the Grassroots Out campaign through his company IM Group. Lord Edmiston told the Times he had been sent a bill from HMRC for \u00a3200,000. It is understood one remain campaign donor has also received a similar substantial tax bill. The Sunday Telegraph reported concerns from both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove about the payment demands, quoting a friend of the environment secretary as saying: \u201cMichael is obviously concerned about action that appears to impinge on our democratic values. This will appear to many like an attempt to silence anyone who dare challenge the establishment and status quo.\u201d A HMRC spokesman said: \u201cDonations to campaign groups don\u2019t qualify as exempt gifts to political parties, unless the recipient is a political party meeting the criteria set out in section 24 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. \u201cNo special exemption was granted ahead of the 2016 referendum. Obviously, the legislation is applied equally to all organisations and groups.\u201d The Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Telegraph it showed the government was \u201cpenalising people who had the audacity to challenge it\u201d. Other MPs said it was clear the tax should be paid if it was owed. The prominent Conservative MP Nicholas Soames said: \u201cSurely it should be quite clear on so-called \u2018Brexit tax\u2019 demands \u2013 if the tax is owed under statute then it should be paid.\u201d Jolyon Maugham QC, a tax expert and pro-remain campaigner who has set up the Good Law Project to challenge both tax evasion and Brexit matters, wrote in an article for his blog on Sunday that HMRC was \u201cdoing no more than acting as parliament and the law compel it to\u201d. He wrote: \u201cRees-Mogg, Johnson and Gove are suggesting that the law should be disapplied to give these immensely wealthy men huge bungs. That\u2019s what the leaders of Brexit are saying. That you should fund unlawful bungs of money to immensely wealthy Brexiters. That\u2019s how much they care about normal working people.\u201d Separately, it was revealed on Sunday that the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage has told newspapers he will not receive an award in this year\u2019s New Year honours list. The lack of a peerage or knighthood has been a sore point for the MEP for several years. He has previously claimed a feud with the former Ukip MP Douglas Carswell blocked him from receiving one. Farage, now a talk radio host, told the Telegraph: \u201cOf course I have not got an honour of any kind \u2013 I am not a remainer. Every one of them got CBEs, they got knighthoods, quite extraordinary. I have got a Brexmas present far more important than the honour. A campaign to get back British blue passports has been successful.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
