All two pupils. \u201cAgggggg\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fceeerrrrooooo!\u201d They\u2019ve heard the Manchester City striker is coming to teach them how to count in Spanish, and that\u2019s (even) more exciting than mummy\u2019s French. For the first time since OKT Primary opened on 23 March they\u2019re really happy to be in class. Well then, for starters, it\u2019s Mr Ag\u00fcero to you, or Se\u00f1or Ag\u00fcero, or possibly Profe. And second of all, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not coming, yet. Boooo! Ag\u00fcero is one of the stars signed up to the BBC Bitesize Daily, the corporation\u2019s biggest ever education programme, launched on Monday to help parents during lockdown. Lord knows, we need it. Actually we\u2019re lucky in this house; the other (some say the only) adult is an actual primary school teacher, which means she\u2019s both here, and knows what she\u2019s doing. Otherwise we\u2019d definitely be in special measures by now. Still, any help is appreciated. Sergio\u2019s Spanish isn\u2019t online yet. To be honest I was more excited about Danny Dyer\u2019s history classes (when he learns ya, you\u2019ll stay learned) but they\u2019re also not there yet. There\u2019s plenty to be getting involved with, new lessons going up every day. We\u2019re year one and year three, so sit down, shut up, today\u2019s first class in year one English: when to use question marks. We watch a short animated video, about when to use question marks. Next clip we see is going to be about a book called The Magic Faraway Tree, but first we have to prepare some questions for the four children in the story using question words. We\u2019ve actually read Enid Blyton\u2019s classic, it\u2019s something of a favourite; so one of the questions, directed at two of the characters, is: why have your names been changed to Rick and Franny, from the original Dick and Fanny? Cue an untimetabled \u2013 and woefully unprepared \u2013 biology lesson. A reasonable and correctly formed question though. The video, when we eventually get to it, is a lovely one. Naomi Wilkinson, talking about and reading from the book in a real tree. As she does so, she climbs ever higher, dodging Dame Washalot\u2019s animated wastewater, towards strange and magic lands high above\u2026 Immediately striking about the clip, and the animated one before it, is its quality. Our homeschool headteacher says she regularly uses BBC Bitesize material (which has been around for ages, it\u2019s just the daily lockdown lessons that are new) in real school, for this reason. It\u2019s professional, well-planned, imaginative, varied, enjoyable, often funny, kids like it, teachers like it \u2026 My favourite history teacher (even though he\u2019s yet to teach us) might call it \u201cthe absolutely bollocks\u201d. Almost like these BBC people have done this kind of thing \u2013 making films, education \u2013 before\u2026 The good marks continue throughout our week. In year one maths, we count on and back in twos, then fives, practising with raisins, which disappear, in tens. And Seymour Science introduces us to the seasons, which we draw. Moving up to year three, in English we identify adjectives, with help from a scary, smelly yeti; then make more powerful adjectives, like terrifying and stinky. And in geography we are introduced to maps by tourist Sue Venir. This pleases me because children today can\u2019t read maps. Then we have to make our own maps, of the local area. Yes? No we can\u2019t go on Google Maps and copy it \u2026 Can we? What about working with a mixed aged class, years one and three round the same table? You know what, it\u2019s OK. The idea of scale, 1:250,000, is certainly tricky for a six-year-old to get a hold of but there is other more graspable stuff, and, because the material is engaging and entertaining, they want to. I\u2019m also finding that with all the practice and activities that follow the presentation, I can set one off, leave him, go back to the other, run two classes at the same time, juggling year three History with year one Music, I\u2019m amazing at this\u2026 No, obviously I\u2019m not. If I\u2019ve learned one thing since 23 March it\u2019s to massively respect the teaching professor. Damn, it\u2019s hard. But there\u2019s a point here too; if I can use this stuff, anyone can. Not only is it all those things already mentioned, it\u2019s easy to use, and it works. A working printer would help for some of the worksheets; no one has a working printer at home, do they? There are ways around it. Possibly a more serious issue is that this obviously comes via a screen in a time when limiting screen time might feel like a losing battle. I can\u2019t see a way round that one. Next week we\u2019ll be trying out the daily lessons on Netflix and Amazon Prime \u2026 no we won\u2019t, there aren\u2019t any. So, hands off the BBC, yes, you lurking at the back, Cummings. And what are you wearing, see me after class. Overall then, marks out of 10 for BBC Bitesize Daily, from the staff and pupils of OKT Primary? Well, we were very disappointed about Ag\u00fcero not coming. Also Dyer, David Attenborough, Jodie Whitaker, Liam Payne, all the starry names being shouted at the launch. What\u2019s wrong with these people, don\u2019t they know that the first rule of teaching is to arrive on time? But, hey, maybe the classroom doesn\u2019t need celebrities. The material is fab. If Sergio does show up, if he could just turn round, so everyone can see the number on his back \u2026 Yup, that\u2019ll be a big fat diez."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
