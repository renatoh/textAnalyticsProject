The YouGov poll found that 71% of those asked said it was important that the regulator would be overseen by an independent commission. On Friday the culture secretary, Maria Miller, the shadow secretary for culture, Harriet Harman, and Liberal Democrat Lord Wallace of Tankerness agreed a new royal charter that would provide a legal basis for a new independent recognition panel. Under the provisions of the royal charter, a chair and board of the panel would be appointed by a committee set up by the commissioner for public appointments. The panel would review the regulator's work every few years. The regulator would be appointed by the press. The press industry indicated on Friday that it would not accept the royal charter because it is being imposed on the industry by politicians. Fraser Nelson, the editor of the Spectator who has long opposed any state involvement in the regulation of the press \u2013 even at arms length \u2013 condemned the proposal. Nelson wrote in the Mail on Sunday: \"On Friday, the three main political parties jointly published a sinister proposal that would change Britain for ever: a royal charter that would give them power over the press. Newspapers are in a mess, they say, so they'd like to step in and call the shots. It's apparently voluntary, but a publication that defies them and seeks to protect its independence would be liable for crippling fines should it end up in court. It is, in other words, the kind of idea unthinkable in Britain for generations: state licensing of the press.\" But the YouGov poll of 1,859 adults found that 71% of those asked thought it was very important or fairly important to have a \"new system of press self-regulation \u2026 periodically reviewed by an independent commission\". The poll found that 14% of those polled thought that it was not very important or not important at all to have this system. The findings were supported by readers of the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph, which have both come out strongly against the royal charter. The poll found that 71% of Mail readers and 90% of Telegraph readers thought it was important to have independent oversight of the regulator. The figure was 88% among Guardian readers and 57% among Sun readers. The full question asked: \"On Tuesday, Maria Miller, the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, rejected a royal charter put forward by the newspaper industry to oversee a new system of press self-regulation. Instead, she said the government would sign off on the original royal charter that was agreed by the main political parties and supported in parliament. \"The royal charter will set up a body to recognise and periodically review a new press self-regulator, in order to check that it is working effectively on behalf of the public. Newspaper publishers have indicated that they will not participate in the cross-party charter and will continue with their own self-regulation scheme. How important, if at all, do you think it is that a new system of press self-regulation is periodically reviewed by an independent commission?\" The poll found little confidence in a system of self-regulation by the press that was not overseen by the independent panel. The poll found that only 15% of those questioned would have confidence in such a system, with 73% saying they would not have confidence. Just 15% of Mail and 17% of Telegraph readers would have confidence in such a system, according to the poll. The full question was: \"How much confidence would you have in a system of press regulation established by the major newspaper publishers, if that system was not reviewed independently?\" The poll found that those questioned overwhelmingly believed that the press would resort to illegal practices, such as phone hacking, if the new system were not established. It found that 79% of those questioned believe there would be a large risk (47%) or a small risk (32%) \u2013 views held widely by Daily Mail, Sun and Telegraph readers \u2013 82%, 71% and 92% respectively. The full question was: \"Imagine the press goes ahead and sets up a regulator without seeking independent recognition. What risk, if any do you think there is that there would be a repeat of unethical and illegal practices (such as phone hacking and intrusions into people's private lives) that were revealed during the Leveson inquiry?\" The poll found readers wanted their newspaper to participate in the new system, although this view was held less strongly. It found that 56% of those questioned would like their newspaper to sign up. This view was held by 54% of Mail readers, 40% of Sun readers, 66% of Guardian readers and 63% of Telegraph readers. Martin Moore, director of the Media Standards Trust, said: \"The public, like Lord Justice Leveson, believe that any new system of press regulation has to be reviewed by an independent commission \u2026 People simply do not have confidence in a system of self-regulation set up by newspaper publishers without any external review or oversight.\" The trust, established in 2006 to uphold higher standards of journalism, was one of the organisations that set up the Hacked Off group, which has been campaigning for the full implementation of the findings of the Leveson enquiry. They are now separate organisations. Sections of the press industry, including the News UK, Mail and Telegraph titles, are seeking to establish the Independent Press Standards Organisation, which would not be subject to review by the recognition panel. Harman said she had no difficulty with that, though it would have to be reviewed by the independent panel. She told Sky News: \"Some of them working on this new body that they are building themselves the Independent Press Standards Organisation. If they make that properly independent, tamper proof from the editors, then it could get recognised and actually we might even reach agreement.\" David Hass, spokesman for Hacked Off said: \"The public backs a system of independent review for the press self-regulator, as prescribed by Leveson, by a landslide. The vast majority of people do not buy the bogus argument that press freedom is at risk and are more concerned that the abuses which gave rise to Leveson could happen again if nothing is done. Most readers want the newspaper they take to act responsibly and join the new system.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
