Yet when thoughtfully executed it is a thing of beauty. In keeping with the martial flavour of this week's pages, let me quote the following exchange between Los Angeles-based Mike Loew, and a man only identified as a \"British Army Bloke\". Mike Loew has assumed the persona of a junior aide in the new Bush administration. I omit the preliminary expressions of mutual good will, mildly alarming though those are in themselves. ML: We came up with an idea that I thought the British Army might be interested in. Basically, all of us here in the US are getting pretty damn tired of France . . . So I was wondering if the British Army would want to declare war on France with us. BAB: (chuckles) Well, you never know. It could happen. Our man, it has to be said, recovers his diplomatic poise, even when goaded to the limits: \"But if they really get on your nerves,\" continues Loew, \"if they really start in with the 'Allo, my name eez Frenchy, we do not want your steenky beef'. . .\" The Army's ad hoc spokesman cuts in with: \"Then we'll know where to come. Straight away. As we always do.\" Indeed. So revealing is that last comment that you wonder whether Loew has made it up to prove a point. One suspects not. Loew might be technically lying when he pretends to be a gay hairdresser trying to join the US Air Force, or a man who has just shot his foot off when he calls the Flower Essence Alternative Therapy Centre for a holistic approach to his injury (\"if you have a homeopathic remedy arnica, you could take that\"); but the air of veracity, by which I mean fully and accurately transcribed conversations, clings to this book. Ringing the hospital where he was born, outraged that he no longer has a foreskin and demanding it back, he is patiently informed that the decision to circumcise him was taken by his parents. The next call in the book is to his parents. He tells his mother he is calling because of his outrage that he no longer has a foreskin, etc, and the first thing she says is: \"Are you taping this for your book?\" The resulting transcript is extraordinary, even for those of you who are used to full and frank exchanges between yourselves and your folks. Or the other way around. There are 26 prank phone calls here, and not all of them come off. But those that do, do so with a brutal logic that is a joy to behold. Loew (who is a staffer on The Onion , the extraordinarily droll American satirical publication) seems to have taken some Method-type pains to get into the personae of the people he is impersonating. Not that some victims appreciate his thoroughness: when he probes the director of a Gated Community (a high-security estate for rich, paranoid Americans) about residents' security arrangements, the gag is that she only realizes she is dealing with a thief when he signs off by saying: \"I should get going now, because I have to come down there and take all your shit.\" This is both a thoughtful and a puerile book. Who or what, you may ask, is being served when a man rings up a church bookstore and asks if they stock any \"Christian pornography\" for himself and his wife? Or rings up a hospital and offers to donate his own nipples? Our own amusement, that's what."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
