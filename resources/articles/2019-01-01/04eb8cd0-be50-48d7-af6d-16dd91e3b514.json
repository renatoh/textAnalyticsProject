It requires huge cuts in red meat-eating in western countries and radical changes across the world. The \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d was created by an international commission seeking to draw up guidelines that provide nutritious food to the world\u2019s fast-growing population. At the same time, the diet addresses the major role of farming \u2013 especially livestock \u2013 in driving climate change, the destruction of wildlife and the pollution of rivers and oceans. Globally, the diet requires red meat and sugar consumption to be cut by half, while vegetables, fruit, pulses and nuts must double. But in specific places the changes are stark. North Americans need to eat 84% less red meat but six times more beans and lentils. For Europeans, eating 77% less red meat and 15 times more nuts and seeds meets the guidelines. The diet is a \u201cwin-win\u201d, according to the scientists, as it would save at least 11 million people a year from deaths caused by unhealthy food, while preventing the collapse of the natural world that humanity depends upon. With 10 billion people expected to live on Earth by 2050, a continuation of today\u2019s unsustainable diets would inevitably mean even greater health problems and severe global warming. Unhealthy diets are the leading cause of ill health worldwide, with 800 million people currently hungry, 2 billion malnourished and further 2 billion people overweight or obese. The world\u2019s science academies recently concluded that the food system is broken. Industrial agriculture is also devastating the environment, as forests are razed and billions of cattle emit climate-warming methane. \u201cThe world\u2019s diets must change dramatically,\u201d said Walter Willett at Harvard University and one of the leaders of the commission convened by the Lancet medical journal and the Eat Forum NGO. The report, published in the Lancet and being launched to policymakers in 40 cities around the world, also concluded that food waste must be halved to 15%. \u201cHumanity now poses a threat to the stability of the planet,\u201d said Prof Johan Rockstr\u00f6m at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Sweden, another author of the report. \u201c[This requires] nothing less than a new global agricultural revolution.\u201d Farm yields in poorer nations must be improved to create a sustainable, healthy world, the report found. The planetary health diet is largely plant-based and allows an average of 2,500 calories a day. It allows one beef burger and two servings of fish a week, but most protein comes from pulses and nuts. A glass of milk a day, or some cheese or butter, fits within the guidelines, as does an egg or two a week. Half of each plate of food under the diet is vegetables and fruit, and a third is wholegrain cereals. Willett said these provide the ingredients for a flexible and varied diet: \u201cWe are not talking about a deprivation diet here; we are talking about a way of eating that can be healthy, flavourful and enjoyable. \u201cThe numbers for red meat sound small to a lot of people in the UK or US,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t sound small to the very large part of the world\u2019s population that already consumes about that much or even less. It is very much in line with traditional diets.\u201d The planetary health diet resembles those already known to be healthy, such as the Mediterranean or Okinawa diets, the researchers said. \u201cThe planetary health diet is based on really hard epidemiological evidence, where researchers followed large cohorts of people for decades,\u201d said Marco Springmann at Oxford University and part of the commission. \u201cIt so happens that if you put all that evidence together you get a diet that looks similar to some of the healthiest diets that exist in the real world.\u201d The report acknowledges the radical change it advocates and the difficulty of achieving it: \u201cHumanity has never aimed to change the global food system on the scale envisioned. Achieving this goal will require rapid adoption of numerous changes and unprecedented global collaboration and commitment: nothing less than a Great Food Transformation.\u201d But it notes that major global changes have occurred before, such as the Green Revolution that hugely increased food supplies in the 1960s. Moves to tax red meat, prevent the expansion of farmland and protect swathes of ocean must all be considered, the commission said. Prof Guy Poppy, from the UK\u2019s University of Southampton, and not part of the commission, said: \u201cThis \u2018call to arms\u2019 with its clear solutions is timely, comprehensively researched and deserves immediate attention.\u201d \u201cThis analysis is the most advanced ever conducted,\u201d said Prof Alan Dangour, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and also not part of the team. \u201cBut there is a major question about the ability of populations to shift to such dietary recommendations and their wider public acceptability.\u201d Prof Nigel Scollan, at Queen\u2019s University Belfast and part of the industry-backed Meat Advisory Panel, said: \u201cThis report tells us what we have known for millennia: an omnivorous diet is optimal. In the UK, encouraging people to eat less red meat and dairy will have little impact on the environment and is potentially damaging to people\u2019s health.\u201d But Richard Horton and Tamara Lucas, editors at the Lancet, said in an editorial that global changes as set out by the planetary health diet were essential: \u201cCivilisation is in crisis. We can no longer feed our population a healthy diet while balancing planetary resources. If we can eat in a way that works for our planet as well as our bodies, the natural balance will be restored.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
