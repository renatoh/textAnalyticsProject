Everton insist they have drawn a line under the protracted transfer saga after their chairman, Bill Kenwright, issued a statement on Thursday clarifying that Stones is not for sale and \u201cwill remain a highly valued member of our first-team squad.\u201d Kenwright\u2019s comment followed the rejection of three Chelsea bids of \u00a320m, \u00a326m and \u00a330m for the England international, with Mart\u00ednez denying the Premier League champions had submitted a fourth offer for the 21-year-old defender. The Everton manager admits Stones has been \u201cmixed up\u201d by Chelsea\u2019s pursuit and that his transfer request \u2013 rejected in a meeting between Mart\u00ednez and the player before Kenwright\u2019s statement \u2013 stemmed from receiving \u201cthe wrong advice\u201d. He said: \u201cIt can be for different reasons, different agendas but I\u2019m not going to go into that.\u201d But Mart\u00ednez also believes Everton\u2019s stance on a player with four years remaining on his contract served notice that not all Premier League clubs bend to the will of wealthier rivals. \u201cAs a club we have the player and we can say we are keeping him. We know the pressure that will bring and that is why the chairman deserves incredible credit,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, who signed the young Uruguay striker Leandro Rodr\u00edguez on Friday and hopes to add another attacking player plus the River Plate defender Ramiro Funes Mori before Tuesday\u2019s deadline. \u201cAny chairman would look at any financial deal as an opportunity to do things but our chairman has done what any Evertonian would do and made the right decision for the football club, not for the financial aspect. Any chairman would put his manager into a big problem if he sold one of the club\u2019s biggest assets at this stage of the window, and that happens. But our chairman has been very clear and very strong. \u201cIn any transfer deal a player can make a decision on whether to accept a deal or stay when two clubs agree. In this situation the two clubs never agreed. It is no good thinking that because you have a Champions League budget you\u2019re going to click your fingers and get anything you want because clearly we don\u2019t work like that.\u201d Stones was berated by a few irate Everton fans following Wednesday\u2019s Capital One Cup win at Barnsley, but was applauded by the vast majority and Mart\u00ednez believes allowing competitive games before the transfer deadline has exposed players to unnecessary hostility. He said: \u201cJohn is a great footballer but he is a better human being. He is an incredible ambassador for Everton and I know he has been put in a position that is very unfair. John is another victim of this stupid system and he needs protection. \u201cThere is a right time and a wrong time for speculation and to have that sort of instability around your football club as a fan and clearly you don\u2019t want it on match days. We will keep an eye security-wise as a football club and every club in this position would do that. During the transfer window we have to be more aware because we are exposing our players to emotions that are normal in this situation. John is in the middle of that storm. Well, he was.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mourinho would not comment on Chelsea\u2019s pursuit of Stones on Friday but stressed that while he would welcome the addition of one more player he would be happy with his current squad if further strengthening proves not to be possible. \u201cHopefully I will have one in,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully. But we are not in trouble. We are not desperate. We are not panicking because the transfer window closes in a couple of days. If we get him, we get him. If not, we don\u2019t But for a perfect shape of the squad, one more player would give us a good balance.\u201d One option the champions could pursue is Zenit St Petersburg\u2019s Argentinian defender Ezequiel Garay, though the Russian champions may prove as resistant as Everton over their centre-half. Interest is retained in Juventus\u2019s Paul Pogba, who would cost a British record \u00a370m, though forcing through a move for the France international so close to the cut-off may prove complicated. The China international defender Zhang Linpeng is expected to complete a move to Chelsea from Guangzhou Evergrande, though he may not qualify for a work permit and would most likely be loaned out initially to a European club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
