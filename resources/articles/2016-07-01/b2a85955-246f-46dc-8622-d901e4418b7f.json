The suburbs have fresh air, sunlight, roomy houses, green lawns and social advantages.\u201d It perfectly summarises the ideal behind suburbia, which is where most people in Britain live today. The huge suburban expansion of British cities between the wars accommodated population growth and enabled people to buy homes at low prices. London doubled in area over those two decades and increased its population by 1.2 million people. Speculators built semi-detached houses for sale at between \u00a3400 and \u00a3500 which were close, as another advertisement put it, to \u201ctiny hills and hollows \u2026 pools of water, brambly wildernesses, where in spring nightingales sing and the air is sweet with the smell of violets, primroses and hawthorn\u201d. It is an ideal that has survived snobbery, condescension and hostility. \u201cJust a prison with the cells all in a row,\u201d wrote George Orwell of a suburban street. \u201cA line of semi-detached torture-chambers \u2026\u201d Cyril Connolly agreed, calling them \u201cincubators of apathy and delirium\u201d. HG Wells called an early example \u201ca dull useless boiling-up of human activities, an immense clustering of futilities\u201d. Now, according to Towards a Suburban Renaissance, a report released last week by independent thinktank the Smith Institute, suburbs are facing a new kind of threat. Their ideal \u201chas rapidly started to fade\u201d, says the report\u2019s author, Paul Hunter. \u201cAs inner cities have undergone a renaissance, suburbs have frequently been left behind.\u201d Focusing on Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and Greater London, the report identifies stagnating levels of job growth and a significant shift outwards from the centres of cities in indicators of poverty. Once sociologists and planners used to worry about \u201cdoughnut cities\u201d, where prosperous residents would move out to the suburbs and leave the centre \u2013 to use another dated term \u2013 to suffer \u201cinner-city decay\u201d. Now the process has reversed. Ben Page, chief executive of Ipsos Mori, has a similar view to Hunter\u2019s: \u201cAll the evidence is that over the last 30 years outer areas have become more miserable than inner. It\u2019s one of the most marked things I\u2019ve seen.\u201d Suburbia generated its literature and filmography, sometimes affectionate, sometimes satirical: The Good Life, The Diary of a Nobody, Abigail\u2019s Party, Terry and June, The Stepford Wives. It provoked sniggers and stereotypes, such as the bored housewife or the \u201cover-eager half-sir\u201d, as a Kensington-based writer said in 1939, who \u201cmows a ridiculous lawn on Saturday afternoons\u201d. Individual suburbs became comedic locations: Private Eye\u2019s Neasden, Peep Show\u2019s Croydon, Peter Sellers\u2019s Balham, Tony Hancock\u2019s East Cheam. Champions of suburbia, such as the writer and broadcaster Paul Barker, have fought back: \u201cI cherish suburbia\u2019s vigour and unexpectedness,\u201d Barker wrote in 2009. He called it \u201ca land of pleasantness, friendship and hope\u201d. But Page says: \u201cAll these ideas we have about leafy suburbs have changed. They are losing their distinctiveness and reasons to be. Family homes have been denatured. They have been made into mini apartment blocks and their gardens are torn up and turned into car parks for all their residents. The high streets are declining. They are turning into dormitories \u2013 and not very nice dormitories at that.\u201d Reasons for the changes, according to Turner, include the success of government policies to revive inner cities and the effects of \u201cagglomeration\u201d \u2013 the idea that investment should support places that already have concentrations of business and population. Page agrees: \u201cInner London has become happier, safer and cleaner.\u201d In the inner-London borough of Hackney, an astonishing 89% of residents declared themselves satisfied with their area in 2013, compared with 51% in 2002. In outer areas such as Havering and Harrow, satisfaction went in the opposite direction. Among other factors, government support for central areas has pushed up property prices, which has forced poorer residents farther out. Migration plays a part: people arriving from poorer countries tend to find homes in the outer districts; those from richer countries settle in the centre. The decline in the provision of social housing in central areas has a similar effect. These factors will increase with recent government policies that will drive local authorities and housing associations to sell socially-rented homes in high-value areas. Other pressures include the building of retail parks and shopping malls on former industrial sites \u2013 which tends to affect suburban high streets more than those in the centre \u2013 and the easing of restrictions on converting offices to homes. Major business districts such as the City of London have won exceptions that allow them to protect their work spaces. In suburbs, low-value but useful places of employment are likely to disappear. The Smith Institute has been making some of these arguments for a while: for example, in a 2014 report called Poverty In Suburbia. Now it is also proposing action. It wants a Suburban Task Force along the lines of the Urban Task Force of the late 1990s: led by Lord Rogers, this helped promote the revival of inner cities. It wants planning policies and investment that specifically address suburbs. It is remarkable that official documents such as the National Planning Policy Framework, while talking about urban and rural areas, don\u2019t even mention suburbia. The title of the institute\u2019s new report, indeed, refers to the Urban Task Force\u2019s 1999 report Towards an Urban Renaissance. Hunter proposes various ways to encourage the sort of economic activity that might flourish in suburbs, such as small businesses and home working. He wonders if the outer areas of large cities might attract the clusters of technology businesses that currently thrive in places such as Cambridge and the Thames Valley. He wants simple but effective ways to improve public transport, such as better buses and cycle routes. He also favours the ideas put forward by the architectural practice HTA for \u201cSupurbia\u201d, whereby existing suburbs are intensified, especially around railway stations and other transport connections \u2013 for example, by increasing building sizes from two storeys to four. This might seem problematic, as it could diminish the openness for which people value suburbs. But it addresses some of the reasons for which suburbia is criticised: that it uses land wastefully and is overdependent on cars. As Page points out, its diffuse layouts mean more infrastructure per person \u2013 more roads, drains and pavements; longer bus routes \u2013 which therefore requires proportionally more public spending. Despite all this talk of decline, suburbs also offer opportunities. They have space, which is becoming more precious as the housing pressures on successful cities grow. They could offer the things that are getting harder to find in inner cities, such as cheap space in which to start a business, and indeed relatively affordable homes. Their ethnic and social diversity is increasing. Today on BBC radio, Hugh Muir talks of the growing movement of \u201cvisible minorities\u201d into what he calls \u201cthe heartlands of Englishness\u201d. The biggest question is how the opportunities of suburbs might be realised without losing the qualities that prompted John Betjeman to celebrate Metroland in his 1973 TV programme or the National Trust to offer tours of Croydon, as it announced last week. How to increase density without losing tranquillity, or raise desirability without losing affordability? How to create homes and work for new populations while also making suburbs better for people who are already there? There are problems that are not the business of suburbs alone. Current government policy is tending to destroy the economic and social diversity of central areas, especially in London, with the risk of creating exclusive inner and excluded outer rings. In fretting about poverty in suburbs there is also the danger that new policies will simply push the poor somewhere else \u2013 making them less visible rather than better off. There is a long history of such confusion, from slum clearances in the 19th century to recent urban regeneration. The answers are not obvious. The Smith Institute\u2019s report does not claim to have them all, but it does at least air them. It raises the powerful and appealing prospect of the renewal and reinvention of the suburban dream. \u201cI was to find,\u201d said a satisfied housebuyer in the 1920s, \u201cthat residing in a suburb adds a thrill and a zest to life. It is an experience in having no traditions to live up to.\u201d Not a bad basis for developing the neighbourhoods of the future.
