The Home Office was refashioned to focus on security, while prisons and probation - together with the courts - were hived off into a new justice ministry. Criticism in the Commons from David Cameron was routine, but the same cannot be said of the unease aired by the country's top judge. The unresolved \"issues of principle\", which the lord chief justice alluded to, boil down to three concerns. First, money: the judges are worried that the courts will now have to compete for funding directly with the political priority of prisons. Second, judges fear the loss of the direct link into the cabinet which the lord chancellor traditionally provided, especially if future justice secretaries are elected politicians with no legal training. Finally, there is the fear that the desire to curry favour could contaminate judgments when, as in prison law, the justice secretary might be the respondent. Judicial independence underpins liberty, so judges are right to be angry that the reform has been rammed through quickly, without taking account of their concerns. Yet their objections are not insurmountable, for combined justice ministries work well overseas. And their caution may be excessive - as it was when the lord chancellor's role was reformed, in a move which has turned out to strengthen rather than weaken judicial independence. As long as court funds are ring-fenced and there are rules enshrining respect for the rule of law, bringing elected ministers into the administration of justice will be a welcome and democratic step. The first - and unelected - justice secretary, Lord Falconer, may only last six weeks in post. He has wasted no time in proving himself to be sensible and active. He displays an empathy with criminal justice professionals that the combative John Reid lacked, and he stated plainly yesterday that rocketing prison numbers must finally be capped. He launched a review tasked with making a reality of earlier talk about replacing short spells in prison with community sentences. More specifically, he explained how he will stem the flow into jail of those committing small misdemeanours while under suspended sentence or parole. Change comes too late to prevent a prisons crisis that has already arrived, as the independent prisons inspector reminds everyone today. The birth of the new ministry has hardly been happy, and looks even less so now that its architect, Mr Reid, has decided to walk off the pitch before a new captain arrives. But if Lord Falconer's thinking reflects the separation of sentencing from security policy, then the ministry of justice will prove its worth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
