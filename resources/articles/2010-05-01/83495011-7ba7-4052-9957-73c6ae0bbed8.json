Visiting his local blood clinic, he uttered the famous line: \"A pint? Why, that's very nearly an armful!\" The doctor retorted: \"You won't have an empty arm ... or an empty anything!\" By the time I had finished chuckling it was all over and I was ready for my free cup of tea and biscuits. Giving blood is not as scary as it sounds, and according to the NHS's National Blood Service every pint donated can save up to three lives: they could be babies, mothers in childbirth or people having operations or suffering from medical conditions. Yet many healthy people who would be eligible to boost the UK's blood bank stocks by giving blood fail to do so, either through fear, apathy or lack of awareness. It's a good and satisfying way of helping other people, at no physical or financial cost to yourself, and your boss may even give you time off to do it. Employers have been crucial in ensuring regular contributions to blood banks by making the workplace available for donations. The National Blood Service estimates that in the past year workplace donations accounted for 16% of all sessions and involved some 1,553 employers. It's easier and more convenient when you have only to go to a mobile unit outside work or in a designated room in your building, rather than leaving work to attend a session. If your employer does not currently offer a service, you could try suggesting it. It could take time to set up and there are waiting lists for new users of \"mini blood mobile units\" in some parts of the country, but the National Blood Service is keen to encourage anyone wanting to organise a session at their workplace to get it in touch (Tel 0300 123 23 23). Workplace schemes are most successful when supported by top management, so that employees know that their organisation's leadership endorses participation and time off. The blood service is able to support participating employers with advice and literature. Steven Sugden of the blood and transplant donor services, says: \"When a session does take place within an appropriate work environment we provide a representative with promotional material to publicise the session. Other ways to encourage staff to donate may be to attach a leaflet to their pay packet, put a link on their website or set up a display.\" Construction company Morgan Ashurst is one of many employers to have signed up to the campaign to \"save 1,000 lives\" by donating blood. It made the commitment at the end of last year and many of its offices are having their second visit from the mobile unit. \"The message has to come from the top\", says its head of sustainability, Mark Turner. \"Our managing director Graham Shennan has given blood himself.\" Turner says workers have embraced the scheme. \"The wife of one employee had to have a blood transfusion when having a baby. People have become very passionate about the whole thing and this will be a long-running initiative for the company, not a one-off. The reality is that only 4% of us give blood, but 96% of us expect to receive it if we need it. That can't be right.\" If you want to donate sooner rather than later check online to find your nearest session. Don't just turn up though \u2013 you will waste less time if you pre-book. To register as a donor you must weigh more than 50kgs (7st. 12lbs) and be in good general health. The lower age limit is 17; the original upper limit of 65 has been scrapped. There are certain categories where you definitely can't give blood (if you have had hepatitis or jaundice in the past 12 months, for example) and some where you may not be able to. There are some specific issues around donating blood in your workplace. You can go back to work after doing so but it is unwise to give blood just before undertaking a hazardous or physically demanding job, such as driving a crane or driving in the emergency services. Causing an accident because you are feeling lightheaded would be more than a little counter-productive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
