The House oversight committee is set to vote Wednesday on whether to hold attorney general William Barr and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for failing to comply with subpoenas related to the 2020 Census. US Customs and Border Protection was hit by a \u201cmalicious cyber attack\u201d that compromised photos of travelers. Read the Guardian\u2019s full story below: A judge granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the state\u2019s last abortion clinic, allowing the clinic to stay open and temporarily preventing the state from becoming the first in the country with no access to legal abortion. The Missouri department of health and senior services had declined to renew the St Louis Planned Parenthood clinic\u2019s license to perform abortions, citing alleged concerns with \u201cfailed abortions\u201d, compromised patient safety and legal violations at the clinic. The refusal to renew the license came after Republican governor Mike Parson signed a restrictive bill prohibiting the procedure after eight weeks and criminalizing doctors who perform it - and is part of growing push against women\u2019s reproductive rights in the US. Richard Nixon\u2019s former White House counsel John Dean testified before the House judiciary committee today, bringing the fire by stating that \u201cRobert Mueller has provided this committee with a road map\u201d to impeachment. It appears Dean\u2019s superfans were also there. Here\u2019s something fun: Lissandra Villa, a Time magazine reporter, has the walk-out song playlist for the 2020 candidates at the Iowa Democrats Hall of Fame campaign event yesterday.

The House oversight committee will vote Wednesday on whether to hold attorney general William Barr and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for failing to comply with subpoenas related to the 2020 Census and the question about citizenship. Read committee chair Elijah Cummings\u2019 full resolution here. The Washington Post is reporting that photos of travelers were leaked in a recent data breach, but the federal agency would not go into detail about the number of images comprised or the nature of them. The leak stemmed from a cyber attack on a federal subcontractor, according to the Post. Why is this so alarming? Quick reminder that even though agency officials declined to say what images were compromised, US Customs and Border Protection maintains a database of passport and visa photos as part of an agency facial-recognition program. The Post also pointed out that the agency \u201cmakes extensive use of cameras and video recordings at the arrival halls of international airports as well as land border crossings, where vehicle license plates are also captured.\u201d Agency officials confirmed that some photos that had been compromised included photos of people\u2019s license plates. \u201cThis breach comes just as CBP seeks to expand its massive face recognition apparatus and collection of sensitive information from travelers, including license plate information and social media identifiers,\u201d Neema Singh Guliani, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, told the Post. \u201cThis incident further underscores the need to put the brakes on these efforts and for Congress to investigate the agency\u2019s data practices. The best way to avoid breaches of sensitive personal data is not to collect and retain it in the first place.\u201d Hey all, Vivian Ho on the west coast taking over for Joanna Walters. Happy Monday. Early evening summary \u2022 The House judiciary committee hearing with former Nixon White House counsel John Dean and former US attorneys as witnesses, discussing the Mueller report and the issue of presidential obstruction of justice, is continuing. Dean has said the Mueller report should be the Watergate equivalent of a \u2018road map\u2019 for Congress to impeach Trump on grounds of obstruction of justice. \u2022Leading House Democrats outside of the 2020 presidential race are unlikely to successfully be able to oppose the Hyde Amendment that restricts abortion funding, because it would put much larger and wider spending legislation at risk. \u2022 The president has been informed about the fatal helicopter crash on the top of a building in New York City, and has tweeted about it. City mayor Bill de Blasio, a 2020 candidate for the White House, has been speaking about the incident on TV. Committee Dems and witnesses play whiffle ball It\u2019s not even softball at the House hearing at this hour. California Democrat Ted Lieu sends the softest, underarm delivery to John Dean. Lieu just quoted Donald Trump, as quoted in the Mueller report, without beeps or asterisks. He quotes to the hearing the bit where the president apparently slumped back in his chair upon hearing about the appointment of the special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate him, in May 2017, and said it was the end of his presidency adding, Lieu then reads out from notes without wavering, \u201cI\u2019m fucked\u201d. Trump was furious that his then attorney general Jeff Sessions had recused himself from the Russia investigation and that deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein had appointed Mueller. Lieu then leaps to current attorney general Bill Barr, who has been accused of acting like Trump\u2019s defense lawyer. Lieu to John Dean: \u201cIs it the role of attorney general to protect the president?\u201d Dean: \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the case in the Nixon White House. I know there is a proud and professional workforce at the Department of Justice that does not do anything other than represent the American people.\u201d He then goes on to list attorneys general who served under Richard Nixon, saying that he did not think they regarded it as \u201ctheir job to represent Nixon\u201d, and adding: \u201cThis is an unprecedented view from Trump as to the function of the attorney general [Barr].\u201d Lieu lobs it to witness Barb McQuade, who whacks a home run. \u201cHe is not the personal attorney for the president,\u201d she says. It\u2019s starting to feel like 5PM on Capitol Hill. As the committee hearing continues on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, top Democrats in Washington are intent on preserving a four-decade ban on taxpayer-financed abortions despite calls from their party\u2019s presidential candidates to abandon it, the AP reports. Leading figures argue that attempts to undo the longstanding consensus will fail - and efforts won\u2019t be worth scuttling a key education and health funding bill. While 2020 presidential candidates such as Democratic front-runner Joe Biden hustle to rewrite their positions on the so-called Hyde Amendment, legislative veterans such as congresswoman Rosa DeLauro have worked behind the scenes to smooth the waters for the provision to continue. It is a long-settled feature of the annual funding measure, which contains numerous programs dear to Democrats. Pragmatism is at play. The GOP-controlled Senate won\u2019t pass the funding measure unless the abortion restriction stays in and, even if the Senate did, Donald Trump would swiftly use his presidential power to veto it. Most leading figures in the Democratic 2020 field already opposed the Hyde Amendment, though many of them have voted for it by default during their Senate or House careers as part of much larger appropriations bills. Democratic efforts this week to repeal the Hyde Amendment appear designed to fail. Hyde first added the provision to the annual measure in 1976. Representative Barbara Lee of California, is a leading voice on the Hill seeking to offer an anti-Hyde provision to the almost $1 trillion spending bill combining health and education spending with the budget for the Pentagon and a handful of other Cabinet departments. But that approach wouldn\u2019t just repeal the Hyde Amendment. It would also mandate new policy to require that the government \u201censure coverage for abortion in public health insurance programs\u201d and other steps. Democratic leaders are not expected to allow Lee to offer the amendment as they announce the rules for floor debate later on Monday, aides said. Nobody wants to hear much from John Malcolm, even Republicans The Democratic-controlled House judiciary committee seemingly made the effort to have a (token) genuine, lasting conservative on the panel of witnesses testifying today in their Mueller report \u2018splain session: the Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society\u2019s John Malcolm. But after more than two hours of this hearing, Malcolm has only been asked one (boring) question, and has even admitted \u201cfeeling lonesome here\u201d. The Democrats want to talk to Dean, Vance and McQuade to get them to say horrid things about Trump and the Republicans want to talk to Dean, Vance and McQuade to say horrid things about them, or just make them listen to plaudits for the president or brickbats for folks like James Comey. We\u2019re not learning much that\u2019s non-partisan. Witness Barbara McQuade on Trump: \u201cThis constitutes obstruction\u201d Former US attorney and now Michigan law professor Barb McQuade just had an interesting interaction with Florida Democrat and committee member Ted Deutch. They talked about events detailed in Robert Mueller\u2019s report that Donald Trump asked then White House counsel Don McGahn to call then deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and order him to \u201cget rid\u201d of special counsel Mueller. And then the president asked McGahn to lie about that, despite multiple urgings from Trump that he \u201cchange his recollection\u201d about their exchange. McQuade tells the committee that Mueller\u2019s report that Trump asked McGahn to create a false document about their exchange regarding Mueller is \u201cthe most serious allegation.\u201d \u201cThis constitutes obstruction of justice\u201d by the president, McQuade says. Florida Republican Matt Gaetz, on the House judiciary committee just sparred with John Dean - but not about Mueller, his report, collusion or obstructio n. Here\u2019s the moment: Mexico tries to clear confusion on tariffs and immigration row with US, indicates Trump gave \u201cultimatum\u201d over tariffs Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard spent Monday trying to clear up confusion sown by a pair of Trump tweets, which implied that there were further elements to the deal between the US and Mexico on migrants transiting Mexico and crossing the US border - that have yet to be revealed, David Agren reports from Mexico City. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican imports if the country didn\u2019t make good on an unannounced, but \u201cfully signed and documented\u201d part of the deal struck last week to avoid Trump slapping tariffs on Mexican imports. Ebrard responded on Monday that everything agreed to in the deal was outlined in a joint statement. Ebrard also told reporters both sides would evaluate whether the stream of migrants had slowed. \u201cIn 45 days both sides have to sit down and say, \u2018well, was it successful or unsuccessful?\u201d Ebrard said of the arrangement. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have results we would have to discuss an agreement which includes the return of asylum seekers under a regional perspective.\u201d The regional perspective, Ebrard said, included countries in the hemisphere such as Brazil, Panama and Guatemala. Trump tweeted Monday that Mexico\u2019s congress would have to ratify \u201can important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico.\u201d But Ebrard said he told US negotiators that he would only have to go his country\u2019s congress \u201cif perhaps these measures don\u2019t work\u201d and they top to pursue a regional deal. Mexican officials have often been forced to try and thread the needle with their responses: clarifying details from negotiations and providing facts on the bilateral relationship, but avoiding any antagonizing of Trump. \u201cImmigration is Trump\u2019s top issue\u201d Ebrard said, acknowledging the political landscape north of the US-Mexico border. \u201cThe entire tone of the relationship with Mexico depends on that.\u201d Ebrard has had the delicate task of correcting errors in Trumps tweets. On Monday, he contradicted Trump\u2019s claim on Twitter on Saturday that Mexico would buy \u201clarge quantities of agricultural products from US farmers, saying on Monday: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a specific agreement on products of this kind.\u201d Describing negotiations in Washington last week, Ebrard said: \u201cIt was very tough. Not tough in the sense that they were rude, rather very tough in the sense the tone was almost one of ultimatum\u201d. He quickly offered a qualification: \u201cActually, get rid of the \u2018almost,\u2019\u201d he said. John Dean: I think there is evidence of collusion in the report Congressman Steve Chabot, Republican of Ohio, gives a fascinating preamble to his question to John Dean. Chabot says he was 19 when, in 1972, he voted for Richard Nixon. In 1973 Chabot said he was on his honeymoon (TMI, Steve) when he watched on TV as John Dean testified to the Senate over the Watergate scandal cover-up. He recalls that many of his friends said that the evidence of such appalling abuse of power by the president and all his men turned them off politics. \u201cBut I thought the opposite. I thought we needed people to go into politics for the right reasons,\u201d Chabot says. He mentions that in 1976 he voted for Jimmy Carter, FYI. He entered local politics in Cincinnati, as a Republican, and eventually became a member of Congress. He sat on the judiciary committee and was closely involved in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s now 20 years after that and it\u2019s been alleged that another president has done something wrong.\u201d Chabot says Mueller found \u201cno collusion\u201d between Donald Trump or members of his election campaign and the Russian government or its operatives and on the obstruction of justice question, Mueller punted the topic to Congress. Then points out that attorney general William Barr declared there had been no obstruction. Chabot finally gets to his sort-of question. Asks John Dean about a report that he alleged Donald Trump colluded with the Russians. John Dean replies: I don\u2019t think I quite said collusion. I think there is evidence of collusion in the report, by the way.\u201d Professor Joyce White Vance would prosecute Trump for obstruction Witness Vance tells the House judiciary committee she believes so strongly that Donald Trump committed obstruction of justice in the way he interfered with and attempted to curtail special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation that she would prosecute. \u201cI would be willing to personally indict the case...and win on appeal,\u201d she said. Vance is a former federal prosecutor from Alabama. President informed of helicopter crash A brief interruption to our committee hearing coverage to mention that Donald Trump has reportedly been informed about an incident in New York. A helicopter has crashed on top of a building in midtown Manhattan this afternoon, with what looks like, at this early stage, a possible fatality. You can follow the news developments as they unfold in our separate story, here. Richard Nixon\u2019s former White House counsel John Dean just began his testimony with a bang. He first notes that he last appeared before the House judiciary committee on July 11, 1974, at the impeachment inquiry into president Nixon (who resigned in August, 1974). Dean says: \u201cI hope I can give a little historical perspective on the Mueller report. In many ways it is to Donald Trump what the \u2018Watergate road map\u2019 was to Nixon.\u201d He\u2019s referring to the evidence Congress used to support its impeachment of Nixon, leading ultimately after the whole Watergate scandal, to the downfall of the president. \u201cStated a little bit differently, Robert Mueller has provided this committee with a road map,\u201d Dean said. The Watergate \u2018road map\u2019 was the report that Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski sent to Congress in 1974 and that informed its impeachment proceedings, which were already underway. Dean is wearing a navy suit and sports thinned white hair and thin-rimmed spectacles. Nadler predicts Don McGahn will testify before Congress \u201cbefore long\u201d Even though the DoJ has agreed to start handing over crucial Mueller investigation material to the committee, Nadler says House Democrats will go ahead tomorrow with voting on the House floor over legal action to enforce subpoenas not only to obtain the full unredacted Mueller report and underlying documents, but also to compel former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify on the Hill. McGahn, a key witness in Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation, has so far declined to testify, as instructed by the White House, despite being subpoenaed. McGahn refused to get rid of Mueller when Trump asked him to and declined to lie about it afterwards. Nadler points out that he and GOP ranking member of the committee, Doug Collins, \u201cagree on the seriousness\u201d of Russian interference in the US election. Nadler reminds us that the Russians interfered with our election No ifs, no buts, judiciary chair Jerry Nadler reminds us that special counsel Robert Mueller found that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 US presidential election, in a direct attack on American democracy. Nadler says: \u201cThere is no question that Congress must investigate this attack....without delay.\u201d He says Mueller found that there were 171 contacts between operatives of the Russian government and 16 Trump campaign officials. House Judiciary Committee hearing about to get underway with John Dean as witness The committee, witnesses and public are settling in, with the usual flurry of press photographers. Chairman Jerry Nadler has called the committee to come to order. Watch live! Streaming now at top of this blog. Trump superfan and anti-immigration hardliner to oversee USCIS An outspoken supporter of Donald Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration policies has been named acting director of the federal agency that manages legal immigration. Ken Cuccinelli will oversee US Citizenship and Immigration Services. Cuccinelli is a former Virginia attorney general and has advocated for denying citizenship to the American-born children of parents living in the US illegally and for limiting in-state tuition at public universities only to citizens or legal residents, the AP writes. Cuccinelli\u2019s name has been mentioned for months to become part of the Trump administration, including as possible Homeland Security secretary or as an immigration \u2018czar\u2019. It\u2019s unclear if Trump will nominate Cuccinelli for the permanent position. That would require Senate confirmation, which could be difficult, even with the Republicans in control of that chamber. The position opened after Trump forced the resignation of Lee Francis Cissna. Trump believed he wasn\u2019t doing enough. Cissna said he worked \u201cpassionately.\u201d Early afternoon summary A busy Monday so far. The House judiciary committee begins its hearing with John Dean and others in half an hour. Meanwhile this morning: House judiciary committee chair Jerry Nadler announced that an agreement had been reached for the DoJ to start turning over \u201ckey\u201d materials from the special counsel Robert Mueller (who stepped down as an employee of the DoJ last month) Trump-Russia investigation. This put his plans (whether real or not) to hold attorney general Bill Barr (top dog at the DoJ) in criminal contempt of Congress \u201cin abeyance for now\u201d. Shenanigans involving US-Mexico negotiations over immigration remain intense, despite Trump pulling back on Friday from his threat to impose tariffs on the United States\u2019s southern neighbor from today. Confusion continues about what is and is not in the latest US-Mexico agreement on the subject, what\u2019s new, what\u2019s old, what\u2019s secret and what isn\u2019t. More to come on that from out correspondent in Mexico soon. The US Supreme Court has rejected an appeal against government restrictions on gun silencers and backed away from taking up an appeal for the release of a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay who has been held there without charge since 2001. Senior Republican responds to developments over Mueller House Republican Doug Collins, of Georgia, the ranking member of the judiciary committee, has released a statement regarding what he terms \u201cfurther accommodations\u201d from DoJ. \u201cThe Justice Department has yet again offered accommodations to House Democrats, and I am glad Chairman Nadler \u2014 for the first time in months \u2014 has finally met them at the negotiating table,\u201d Collins\u2019s statement says. He further points out that today\u2019s \u201cgood faith provision\u201d from the administration further \u201cdebunks claims\u201d that the White House is stonewalling Congress, which intelligence committee chairman and California Democrat Adam Schiff\u2019s successful negotiations with the Justice Department \u201calready showed\u201d. Collins now asks: \u201cIs the chairman [Nadler] prepared to rescind his baseless recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt, or do House Democrats still plan to green light lawsuits against the attorney general and former White House counsel tomorrow?\u201d And Nadler\u2019s news release also includes some handy background: On April 19, the House judiciary committee issued a subpoena for the unredacted Mueller report and key underlying evidence. The Department of Justice refused to comply with the May 1 deadline for production of those materials. Although the Committee made repeated attempts to negotiate for the materials responsive to the subpoena, the Department cut off negotiations on the evening of May 7. On May 8, the committee voted to recommend that the House hold Attorney General [William] Barr in contempt of Congress. On May 24, Chairman Nadler wrote to White House Counsel and the Attorney General to remind them that, \u201c[n]otwithstanding the President\u2019s stated intent to block all congressional subpoenas, the Committee also remains prepared to meet with the Department and the White House to ascertain if an acceptable accommodation can be reached.\u201d Here\u2019s Nadler\u2019s full news statement: Today, House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) announced that he had reached an agreement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) over obtaining key evidence in the Mueller Report related to possible obstruction of justice by President Trump. Chairman Nadler made the following statement: \u201cI am pleased to announce that the Department of Justice has agreed to begin complying with our committee\u2019s subpoena by opening Robert Mueller\u2019s most important files to us, providing us with key evidence that the Special Counsel used to assess whether the President and others obstructed justice or were engaged in other misconduct. The Department will share the first of these documents with us later today. All members of the Judiciary Committee\u2014Democrats and Republicans alike\u2014will be able to view them. These documents will allow us to perform our constitutional duties and decide how to respond to the allegations laid out against the President by the Special Counsel. \u201cGiven our conversations with the Department, I will hold the criminal contempt process in abeyance for now. We have agreed to allow the Department time to demonstrate compliance with this agreement. If the Department proceeds in good faith and we are able to obtain everything that we need, then there will be no need to take further steps. If important information is held back, then we will have no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies. It is critical that Congress is able to obtain the information we need to do our jobs, ensuring no one is above the law and bringing the American public the transparency they deserve.\u201d Barr escapes criminal contempt vote Attorney general William Barr has avoided the risk of being held in criminal contempt for blocking congressional demands for key evidence from Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation. Weeks spent threatening to hold Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in criminal contempt for defying subpoenas over the full Mueller report and underlying materials clearly coincided with intense negotiations behind the scenes. This has now resulted in the beginning of greater cooperation between the DoJ and leading House Democrats, with previously-secret Mueller materials being handed over for House judiciary committee members to review in private, from this afternoon. That coincides with an important hearing where former White House counsel under Richard Nixon, John Dean, and other former US attorneys of more recent vintage, will testify to explain how prosecutors go through the process or investigating and taking action over obstruction of justice and abuse of power. In recent days, House Democrats had talked of going to court to enforce the subpoenas, rather than holding Barr in contempt anyway. But there is now discussion underway in the media about whether there will still be a vote on the floor tomorrow to hold Barr and McGahn in \u201ccivil contempt\u201d - which would be more of a gesture at this stage. Nadler said on Monday that the House is still expected to consider a resolution tomorrow authorizing the committee to enforce its subpoenas in federal court. His statement added that some enforcement action may be necessary to obtain documents and testimony outside the scope of today\u2019s agreement with DoJ, including testimony from McGahn. DoJ agrees to hand over Mueller evidence to House judiciary committee Jerry Nadler says the committee\u2019s reached a deal with the department of justice to obtain \u201ckey evidence\u201d from Mueller\u2019s files on obstruction of justice, in relation to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the US 2016 presidential election and Russian contacts with the Trump campaign. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler has issued a statement about the small but important concession the DoJ has just made in acquiescing to Dems\u2019 demands for more Mueller materials. Here\u2019s a useful tweet: House investigation jumps forward House judiciary chairman and New York Democrat Jerry Nadler just announced: \u201cI am pleased to announce that the Department of Justice has agreed to begin complying with our committee\u2019s subpoena by opening Robert Mueller\u2019s most important files to us, providing us with key evidence that the Special Counsel used to assess\u201d whether Trump obstructed. This news just tweeted by the Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake. Mike Pence praises Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong stand\u201d on Mexico Potus just retweeted Veep (the Veep, not Veep, sadly) from yesterday, #ICYMI. Mike Pence posted: \u201c.@POTUS\u2019 strong stand got Mexico to do things they have never done before: 6,000 National Guard at their southern border, immigration checkpoints throughout Mexico &amp; allow ALL illegal immigrants from Central America to remain in Mexico pending their asylum claims..\u201d House Judiciary Committee hearing on the Mueller report We\u2019ll live stream the hearing on this blog when it gets underway at 2PM local time in Washington. The star witness is former attorney, Nixon White House counsel and inmate, present day author and political pundit - John Dean, whom Donald Trump has decided is a \u201csleazebag\u201d. But there are also three other witnesses today. Joyce White Vance is a former US attorney for the northern district of Alabama and a University of Alabama law professor and MSNBC contributor. She explained on Twitter last night that her job today is to help people understand how DoJ prosecutors assess evidence and take action. Leaning more to the right, there\u2019ll be legal scholar John Malcolm, vice president for the institute for constitutional government, which is under the umbrella of conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, in Washington, DC. He\u2019s also chairman of the criminal law practice group of the Federalist Society. And, may the fourth (chair) be with her, the former US attorney for the eastern district of Michigan and professor at University of Michigan law school, Barbara McQuade. Joyce White Vance tweeted what she called a \u201chandy link\u201d to the summary Mueller wrote for each volume of his report. But, appointed by the Obama administration, her pinned tweet says this: Jon Swaine\u2019s on CNN now, folks, talking about his story today. If you happen to have sight of CNN, on your phone, in your news room, veterinary\u2019s waiting room, airport departure lounge or, you know, actual lounge (if the latter, congratulations on having the day off/working from home/being retired), keep an eye out for Guardian senior reporter Jon Swaine. He\u2019s going on air any moment (which we literally expect to be any moment, but, in CNN-speak, \u201cany moment\u201d could mean any time in the next hour...or more), to discuss his exclusive story today about: The company part-owned by Jared Kushner that received $90m from unknown offshore investors since 2017. You can read the full version here. And there\u2019s a very lively debate going on about it on Twitter. US Supreme Court rejects challenge to gun silencer regulations As the Supreme Court\u2019s June decision flurry continues, the bench announced it\u2019s rejecting a challenge to federal regulation of gun silencers. It is just a matter of days since a gunman used one in the shooting rampage that killed 12 people, mostly local government workers, in their workplace in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The justices did not comment on Monday in turning away appeals from two Kansas men who were convicted of violating federal law regulating silencers, the AP writes. The men argued that the constitutional right under the second amendment \u201cto keep and bear arms\u201d includes silencers. Kansas, Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, South Carolina, Texas and Utah urged in a filing that the justices hear the appeal, saying the court should affirm that the Second Amendment protects \u201csilencers and other firearms accessories.\u201d The Trump administration asked the court to stay out of the case and leave the convictions in place. The administration, meanwhile, has done next to nothing to advance greater gun control in the US. Police are still trying to determine the motive for massacre in Virginia, after a worker who had just resigned opened fire in a municipal building on May 31, armed with two semi-automatic handguns, a silencer and extended ammunition magazines. The gunman (whose identity we prefer not to remind you of here) was killed in a lengthy shoot-out with law enforcement. Mexico\u2019s border pact With US bought time Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Monday morning that the border agreement it struck to avert US tariffs bought Mexico time to show that it can reduce the flood of Central America migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border. Ebrard said the immigration agreement delayed for now the Trump administration\u2019s demand that Mexico accept becoming a safe third country, which would require that migrants setting foot in its territory request asylum there, instead of in the US, the Wall Street Journal reports this morning. Mexico persuaded US officials to give the measures time, he said, and agreed that if they fail to reduce the flood of migrants heading north, the sides would meet again to discuss further US proposals. Under the agreement reached late on Friday, the government of Mexican president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador agreed to speed up the reception of migrants returned from the US to await their US asylum hearings in Mexico and to speed up the deployment of National Guard troops in border areas to support Mexican migration officials. The Supreme Court on Monday declined to wade into the contentious question of to what extent detainees held by the US military at the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, can seek their release, turning away an appeal by a Yemeni-born man held since 2001. The court refused to consider an appeal by Yemeni detainee Moath Hamza Ahmed al Alwi, who was captured in Pakistan in December 2001 and detained without charge ever since, Reuters reports this hour. The government has said al Alwi was involved in fighting against US and allied forces in Afghanistan and was closely linked with the Islamic militant group al Qaeda. After the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks on America, the US began a long-running military campaign in Afghanistan targeting al Qaeda, which carried out the attacks, and the Taliban-led government that sheltered the group. Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the court\u2019s four liberals, issued a statement saying that the court should weigh in on the issue at some point to decide \u201cwhether, in light of the duration and other aspects of the relevant conflict, Congress has authorized and the Constitution permits continued detention.\u201d Al Alwi \u201cfaces that real prospect that he will spend the rest of his life in detention based on his status as an enemy combatant a generation ago,\u201d Breyer added. Al Alwi, who was born in 1977 and is in his early 40s, has said he should be released, in part because the US conflict in Afghanistan has \u201ceffectively ended.\u201d His lawyers have said that the authority of the United States to hold him has \u201cunraveled\u201d because of the length of the conflict. In a 2018 decision, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected his claims. Noticeable by his absence - Robert Mueller Okay, John Dean\u2019s interesting. His testimony this afternoon before the House judiciary committee may even be illuminating and important. But there\u2019s still an air of House Dems marking time until they can, hopefully, lasso Robert Mueller himself to appear on the Hill and answer questions about his report, published mid-April. Mueller can say all he wants that \u201cit\u2019s all in the report\u201d but that cry sounds less noble than plaintive when there are still so many unanswered questions, redactions, secret underlying material and puzzling perspectives out there. If by \u201call in the report\u201d he means \u201cread between the lines\u201d, which was kind of what his little press conference (no Q &amp; A) was like last month, it shows all the more why he needs to submit to questioning by lawmakers. House anti-trust sub-committee chairman David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, told CNN on Sunday, in explaining why Mueller hasn\u2019t been dragged in yet: \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re doing this right....we want to be respectful of the special counsel....if that doesn\u2019t work, obviously we\u2019ll compel his attendance.\u201d Watergate star witness John Dean says he\u2019ll be providing a House panel \u201csome context\u201d and comparison between investigations during Nixon\u2019s administration and that of Donald Trump, the AP writes. He told CNN he\u2019ll tell the House judiciary committee on Monday, in the hearing commencing in Washington at 2PM, \u201chow strikingly like Watergate what we\u2019re seeing now, as reported in the Mueller report, is.\u201d Dean says he\u2019ll focus on the question of obstruction of justice in his testimony. Special counsel Robert Mueller investigated Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and contacts with Trump\u2019s campaign. Mueller did not reach a determination on whether Trump tried criminally to obstruct the probe by taking actions such as firing FBI Director James Comey. Mueller said charging the president with a crime was \u201cnot an option\u201d because of federal rules. Dean tells CNN that Comey\u2019s firing \u201cwas certainly not dissimilar from some of the actions Nixon took.\u201d In 1973, Nixon ordered attorney general Elliot Richardson to fire independent special prosecutor Archibald Cox, but Richardson refused and resigned. Trump repeatedly called Mueller\u2019s probe a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Top Democratic leaders may be in no rush to launch an impeachment inquiry but the hearing today is the first in a series on Mueller\u2019s report. John Wesley Dean III served as White House counsel to Nixon from July 1970 until he was fired in April 1973. He captivated the attention of Americans, though, with his televised testimony in June 1973 before the Senate Watergate Committee, the New York Times wrote in 2018. Mr. Dean sat at a table \u2014 in a tan suit and signature horn rim glasses, his wife, Maureen, behind him \u2014 and told the senators that Nixon was directly involved in the Watergate cover-up. He was one of the first officials in the Nixon administration to speak out. Mr. Dean was worried he was being set up by his former boss to take the blame for the June 1972 break-in by five men at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington. Indeed, the White House called him the cover-up\u2019s \u201cmastermind,\u201d the NYT reported in June 1973. For his part, Mr. Dean has long maintained his colleagues sought to make him a scapegoat. He served a reduced sentence, in return for helping the FBI investigation into the scandal and cover-up, of four months in prison after pleading guilty to obstruction of justice. Dean was also disbarred. Trump calls Nixon counsel John Dean \u201csleazebag attorney\u201d Is the president just rattled about the House judiciary committee hearing today or is he reasonably criticizing what could be quite the showboat event on Capitol Hill today? White House counsel John Dean turned on his boss during the Watergate scandal that eventually led to Nixon\u2019s downfall (and Dean\u2019s imprisonment). He testified in devastating form before the Senate Watergate Committee in June 1973, having warned Nixon, amid presidential lying and abuse of power, that there was \u201ca cancer growing on the presidency\u201d. Fast forward 46 years and Dean is a CNN commentator and is frequently critical of the current occupant of the White House. He\u2019ll be testifying again this afternoon in the committee\u2019s \u201cexplanation session\u201d about the Mueller report. On Sunday evening, Trump tweeted his rage that the Democrats continue to investigate him, saying, in part: \u201cThey are even bringing in @CNN sleazebag attorney John Dean. Sorry, no Do Overs - Go back to work!\u201d Here\u2019s the tweet - and there are some choice responses: Before we continue with coverage of the breathless anticipation (no less breathless from the White House) of John Dean on Capitol Hill this afternoon and the ongoing US-Mexico immigration mess, we must draw your attention to our scoop this morning. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine reports today that a real estate company part-owned by Jared Kushner has received $90m in foreign funding from an opaque offshore vehicle since he entered the White House as a senior adviser to his father-in-law Donald Trump. Investment has flowed from overseas to the company, Cadre, while Kushner works as an international envoy for the US, according to corporate filings and interviews. The money came through a vehicle run by Goldman Sachs in the Cayman Islands, a tax haven that guarantees corporate secrecy. Kushner, who is married to Trump\u2019s elder daughter Ivanka, kept a stake in Cadre after joining the administration, while selling other assets. His holding is now valued at up to $50m, according to his financial disclosure. You can read his full report here. The president is hopping mad with the New York Times over its coverage of his immigration agreement with Mexico. Read more about it in our story today. Our Oliver Milman reports that: Trump returned to the offensive...accusing the New York Times of \u201csick journalism\u201d for a report, which said key components of the deal, announced on Friday, had been agreed for months. The president is tweeting this morning about the mysterious Mexico \u2018deal\u2019 over tariffs and quashing migration flows into the United States, but it\u2019s still as clear as mud and as tricky to navigate as a swamp. \u201cWe have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico, one that the U.S. has been asking about getting for many years. It will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by Mexico\u2019s Legislative body!..\u201d goes Tweet One. Followed by this: \u201c....We do not anticipate a problem with the vote but, if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming, Tariffs will be reinstated!\u201d Happy Monday morning, here we go with our daily US politics live blog. What\u2019s on the agenda today in Washington and beyond? If you relish reading Nixon, Watergate, Trump and Mueller in the same sentence, it\u2019s likely to be a good day for you. Former White House counsel John Dean, a key witness during the Watergate scandal that led to Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation, testifies today before the House Judiciary Committee at a hearing entitled Lessons from the Mueller report: presidential obstruction and other crimes. It\u2019s a \u2018splain session. 2PM ET. Donald Trump has just referred to Dean as \u201csleazebag attorney\u201d. There is a close watch on for any concrete details emerging from the White House, the State Department of the Department of Homeland Security about exactly what measures Mexico might be taking to stem the arrival of migrants from Central America at the US-Mexico border. This following the hiatus in Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on Mexico from today over the issue. The threat has apparently not gone away and is just on hold. Most of the leading Democratic candidates for the 2020 nomination will continue their campaigns in Iowa today after they saturated the state at the weekend searching for early support to help them stand out in the early caucus state. Things got quite chaotic on Sunday with 19 candidates falling over each other in Cedar Rapids. Amy Klobuchar can enjoy splendid breathing room today in New Hampshire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
