When Ireland's Moving Hearts burst into existence in 1981, such was their momentum that bouzouki player D\u00f3nal Lunny likened it to being dragged by a speeding bus. Fusing traditional Irish folk with rock, the band's early incarnation, featuring the politically charged vocals of Christy Moore, came as a jolt on their native shores and left a legacy felt today. When they reunited last year, without Moore and guitarist Declan Sinnott, fans were initially disappointed that the lineup was that of 1984's instrumental album The Storm, rather than the original raucous bunch. But such was the scope and influence of that record that it is hard to begrudge them the thrill of performing again. Twenty years have passed and hairlines may have receded, but the stunning level of musical virtuosity remains. At this Celtic Connections festival gig, they perform a set taken largely from The Storm. The intricate developments of uilleann pipe-driven tunes such as The Lark are rendered with the skill of master craftsmen. There are eight of them on stage - nine, when Mairtin O'Connor joins them on the accordion - and at times it seems they are taking turns to lay blows in a frantic musical spat. On Downtown, piper Davy Spillane plays with such ferocity that the artificial smoke being pumped out behind him could almost be coming from his fingers. Aspects of their sound have dated, the keyboards in particular, but as an exhibition of technical prowess, Moving Hearts still have much to offer. \u00b7 At Eden Court, Inverness, tonight. Box office: 01463 234234. Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
