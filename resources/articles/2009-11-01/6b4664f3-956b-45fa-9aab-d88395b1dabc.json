She is wholesome, that much is undeniable, but she has her name on plenty of inventive, imaginative and precisely calibrated examples of modern chart pop, songs that would have been noticed beyond her audience of young girls had they come from a more credible source. This mini-album opens with one such, Kicking and Screaming, a declamatory techno-rock exercise of the sort that characterised Girls Aloud's golden period. Party in the USA is a cute pop song, with a clever clash between feathery jazz guitar chords and a booming synth bassline serving as hook. But it's downhill from there, thanks to a run of inferior ballads arrested only at the very close by one rather superior ballad, The Climb - but that's been bussed in from the Hannah Montana movie soundtrack to add some ballast since this collection's US release."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
