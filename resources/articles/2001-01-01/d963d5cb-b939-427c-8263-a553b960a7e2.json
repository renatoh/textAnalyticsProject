The warning came from Sir Michael Bett, pro-chancellor of Aston University, and chairman of the committee which two years ago called for hundreds of millions of pounds to be injected into universities to improve pay and conditions for staff. \"In 2005 we are due for an exodus of teachers from higher education,\" Bett told the House of Commons education committee. \"We are sliding down the hill at the moment but there is a crisis on the horizon.\" Bett said that students were put off academic careers because they could earn much more in other professions. He added that top-up fees would come if there isn't a government response to the crisis. Professor John Beath, chairman of the Conference of Heads of University Departments of Economics, added that universities were facing a \"swinging 60s' timebomb\" when many academics retired in 2005. The MPs are carrying out an inquiry into student drop out rates, which vary dramatically for academic institutions. Yesterday, the MPs heard that more students are being thrown out of university because they can not pay their tuition fees. Professor Diana Green, vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, said that the number of students excluded for debt at the university has risen by 17 per cent since 1998, when fees were first introduced. Next week, the committee will hear from education minister, Tessa Blackstone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
