The claim from Robert O\u2019Brien came as top members of the administration gave differing accounts on the status of intelligence reports on Russian bounty payments, and why Trump had not taken action in response, but had repeatedly pressed to re-admit Russia to the G7 club of nations. Trump himself continued to suggest that the allegations of Russia paying Taliban fighters to kill Americans were a \u201choax\u201d. It has been reported that the intelligence was included in the written presidential daily brief (PDB) given by the CIA. O\u2019Brien appeared to suggest it had not been included in verbal briefings given to Trump. \u201cThe president\u2019s career CIA briefer decided not to brief him because it was unverified intelligence,\u201d O\u2019Brien told Fox News, adding: \u201cShe made that call and, you know what, I think she made the right call, so I\u2019m not going to criticize her. And knowing the facts that I know now, I stand behind that call.\u201d O\u2019Brien was severely criticised for putting the blame for a major policy issue on a relatively junior CIA official. \u201cThis is the same scapegoating play that the White House ran in the coronavirus context \u2013 blaming Trump\u2019s intelligence briefer for something that is chiefly and fundamentally a failing of the White House staff,\u201d said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and national security spokesman. He added: \u201cWe now know that the information was included in Trump\u2019s written PDB, which is how the intelligence community regularly flags items that the President needs to know. Nothing in the PDB is discretionary; everything in that short document is in there because \u2013 in the estimation of the intelligence community \u2013 the president needs to know it to fulfill his charge.\u201d Intelligence experts have also pointed out that intelligence routinely briefed to the president is rarely \u201cverified\u201d, but presented with varying degrees of confidence. Trump continued to insist he had not been told, and questioned the veracity of the reports. \u201cFrom what I hear, and I hear pretty good, the intelligence people \u2013 many of them \u2013 didn\u2019t believe it happened at all,\u201d the president told Fox News. \u201cI think it\u2019s a hoax. I think it\u2019s a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats.\u201d Meanwhile, Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, insisted that the Russian threat in Afghanistan was real and had been properly addressed, implying the president had been kept informed. \u201cWe took this seriously; we handle it appropriately,\u201d Pompeo, a former CIA director, told reporters. \u201cThe president has been consistently aware of the challenges that Russia presents to us and he is aware of the risk in Afghanistan. \u201cIt\u2019s why we have spent so much time over this past year at the president\u2019s direction to reduce risk to our forces in Afghanistan in a way no previous administration has done.\u201d Pompeo said it was up to the president whether to invite Russia to meetings of the G7 group of major industrialised democracies, but added: \u201cI think it is wholly important and appropriate for the United States to continue to have dialogue with the Russians to convince them to change some of the activities that are inconsistent with what it is the United States needs to do to preserve security and freedom for its own people.\u201d A former senior US official confirmed to the Guardian that reports of Russian bounties were circulating inside the White House before the summer of 2019, and raised concern, but at that point had not been fully corroborated. The official said that more detailed information had surfaced since then, but added it was likely that president had ignored the news as it conflicted with his desire to cultivate good relations with Vladimir Putin. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like hearing bad news about all kinds of things, unless he\u2019s forced to,\u201d the former senior official said. CNN cited former officials on Wednesday as saying Trump\u2019s resistance to intelligence warnings about Russia led his national security team, including those who delivered the PDB to brief him verbally less often on Russia-related threats to the US. A former Taliban spokesman, Mullah Manan Niazi, told the Daily Beast: \u201cThe Taliban have been paid by Russian intelligence for attacks on US forces - and on Isis forces - in Afghanistan from 2014 up to the present.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
