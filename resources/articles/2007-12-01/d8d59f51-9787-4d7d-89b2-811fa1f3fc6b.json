He fantasises about blowing up the shiny Los Angeles skyscraper he lives in, but he settles instead for the notion of shooting five of his colleagues and saving the sixth round for himself. But while Bob searches for a bullet he's dropped, the sad guy in the adjoining booth pulls out a gun and launches an office massacre. Bob kills him, thus becoming an accidental hero. He's elevated to the post of Vice-President for Creative Thinking and becomes the carer of the beautiful high-flying executive Vanessa (Elisha Cuthbert), left paralysed by the killer, who in slightly different circumstances might have been Bob himself. This is an amusing satire that doesn't quite know where to go and starts to fall off on the way to a surprise ending. Slater is very good as the creepy nebbish (there are hints that the director is thinking about Jack Lemmon and The Apartment), and the title refers to the usual reply given to TV interviewers when they ask the neighbours of a random killer what he was like. The film has some original music, which struck me as inappropriate for a director called Frank A Cappello."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
