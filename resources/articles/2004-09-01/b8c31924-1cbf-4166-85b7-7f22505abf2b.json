Founded as a 'liberation through sex' commune by the celebrity guru Bhagwan Rajneesh, it's the main, and sometimes most prurient, reason people come to Pune, a pleasant town 70 or so miles south-east of Mumbai (for merly Bombay). As we wait to be shown 'a radically new approach to bringing awareness to our daily lives', I bring my own awareness to the rest of my tour group. On the left is a self-proclaimed 'white witch' from the United States, a newcomer to India who asked: 'What are those long dresses the women wear?' Saris. 'Could you spell that?' Next to her is a regal travel writer from Delhi who has brought along a male assistant to carry her cameras. Then there's an excitable Italian in a back-to-front baseball cap who has spent many hours having his nails filed by the train's beautician. Over to the right is a travel agent from Singapore who books herself into the train's on-board spa every night. We are not your typical tour group. But then, as the spa and the beautician suggest, the Deccan Odyssey, which we're previewing before its first full season is launched next month, is not your typical Indian train. On its 1,000-mile circuit of the state of Maharashtra - Mumbai down to Goa and back, with a detour to Aurangabad - its gleaming blue livery compels attention. It lures the curious at obscure stations on remote branch lines. They crowd around the smoked-glass windows and peer inside. What they see is a revelation. No sign of the packed compartments and stomach-tweaking toilets that typify everyday Indian rail travel. No sign of hawkers slopping tea from urns, or porters pushing and shoving with mountains of luggage, or trays of half-eaten food left to fester on the floor. For Indian rail users, the Deccan Odyssey is glamour beyond imagining. Its plush cabins have proper beds, en suite bathrooms and fittings carved with parakeets and peacocks. Its dining cars have customised cutlery with a logo repeated on the cups, the saucers, even the light switches. It boasts a conference car and a business centre, a smart bar and the aforementioned spa, offering facials and Ayurvedic massage. The eyes of the curious widen with wonder - and they haven't even seen the prices. High-season passengers (there's space for 96 of them, with 30 staff) pay up to\u00a3270 a day. A couple booking the full seven-night package can expect to pay \u00a32,700, which doesn't include travel to India, hotels in Mumbai, drinks and spa treatments. That's about five years' wages for an Indian schoolteacher. So who is the Deccan Odyssey aimed at, I ask Ashish Kumar Singh, the personable managing director of Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation, which has launched the train. 'Tourists from both India itself and abroad,' he says. 'In fact, anyone who earns more than $20,000 (\u00a311,000) a month.' I blink and he eventually scales it down to people with a household income of \u00a34,000 a month. Singh describes the tour as 'a chance to explore virgin areas and see what the lifestyle of rural India is all about'. Apart from a day in Goa and visits to the Ajanta and Ellora caves, it takes in places largely bypassed by mainstream tours. It offers an up-river cruise through mangrove creeks, with dolphins leaping past the boat a possibility, trips to vineyards and to see Hindu pilgrims bathing at sacred ghats . All this is interesting, but anyone fancying a once-in-a-lifetime splurge on an upmarket Indian train might head first for the renowned Palace on Wheels tour around the Delhi-Jaipur-Agra Golden Triangle. More adventurous travellers might try its sister train, the Royal Orient, a fascinating voyage of discovery through the less commercialised state of Gujarat. In such company, the Deccan Odyssey, named after central India's Deccan plateau, is clearly one for the connoisseur, and, every so often, there's a distinct hint of barrels being scraped and straws being clutched. You could, like me, have spent 20 years visiting India without chancing on Ratnagiri, Sawantwadi or Ganpatipule. You don't know Ganpatipule? We reach it by boat on the second day, after a drive on National Highway 17 (along which farmers are herding cows). It's essentially a beach with a deserted splendour that reminds old India hands of Goa before mass tourism, when the times were good, if a little hazy and, hey, you were deafened by the sound of silence. Palm trees, hammocks, cheap beer, cashew groves, mango plantations, more cheap beer and a slight sense of puzzlement. We spend three hours here, rather at a loose end, sunbathing, watching the waves and a 'cultural programme' performed by children. The white witch wonders whether, so early in the trip, this is really the moment for 'free time'. The itinerary, after all, shows there's still a temple and a fort to visit before we rejoin the train at 8pm, 12 hours after leaving it (marathon sightseeing days: very Indian). The train travels mostly at night. This disappoints rail buffs, who were looking forward to watching the daytime landscape drift past the window, one of the great pleasures of Indian travel. So the train is essentially a mobile hotel, a place for sleeping and eating. The staff are unfailingly friendly and helpful. The food, drawing on the catering expertise of the Taj group, is strong on regional dishes and flexible enough to accommodate passengers who demand pizza and chicken Caesar salad. And the itinerary? Well, the culture comes cling-wrapped for tourists. And there's an under-appreciation of foreigners' compulsive need to shop. But the Ajanta and Ellora Caves prove as astonishing as every guidebook claims, with carved Buddhas that have been serenely reclining for a millennium and a half, and vast temples sculpted from rock. The regal Indian travel writer's assistant works hardest here, juggling cameras like a circus artist. At nearby Aurangabad, the Bibi-ka-Maqbara mausoleum offers a scaled-down Taj Mahal. Goa is Goa. And in Pune, the Raja Dinkar Kelkar museum has enchanting collections of everyday household objects - lemon squeezers, noodle makers, mango cutters, coconut crushers - proving that utilitarian things can also be beautiful. We have high tea at Pune's Turf Club, a relic of colonial days, when one of the town's churches had a Rev Madge, a Rev Mould and a Rev Midwinter. But the highlight is Osho, a theme park of meditation and materialism dismissed by the Wall Street Journal as 'a spiritual Disneyland for disaffected First World yuppies'. The snowy-bearded Bhagwan, with his taste for Darth Vader tunics, woolly hats and pastel Rolls Royces (a fleet of 90), died in 1990, but an introductory video shows him droning unblinkingly on about 'personal growth, awareness and individual transformation'. His saffron-robed disciples beam adoringly as he reaches a drowsy climax: 'Just be. Do nothing and the grass grows by itself. Sit silently doing nothing, just being in the utter silence of being.' This proves a bit tricky when the video room is next to the dance area. Justin Timberlake blasts from the loudspeakers as flailing female devotees disco-gyrate through their 'dance-meditation' like a metaphysical Pan's People. Lisa Petterson, a sweetly smiling Osho babe from Sweden, leads us on a guided tour of the resort's lush campus, full of ferns and bamboo, like Kew Gardens with karma. We pass the cappuccino bar, the swimming pool and the sports area, celebrated for a 'unique synthesis of tennis and meditation' called Zennis. (Lunch preparations once involved a 'Daily Veggie-Chopping Meditation'.) Pan pipes play over trickling water cascades. As we leave, I ask Lisa what she does back home. 'I'm a shift-leader at McDonald's,' she says. In a profoundly grass-growing way, this seems to encapsulate so much about 'being' that I feel ready to tackle another afternoon on the beach. I work hard at relaxation - lying in a hammock, gazing at the breakers pounding the bright white arc of sand, doing nothing with ever increasing determination and intensity. But the utter silence of being eludes me. It doesn't, however, elude the excitable Italian with the immaculate nails. He had planned to leave the tour early and fly to Delhi. Unfortunately, he has forgotten where he is being picked up and doesn't have the phone number of the taxi firm. Back on the train, he frets for a moment or two, shrugs and strolls off to the spa for another manicure.
