Is it a credit card with punitive rates of interest? Or credit default swaps on the bonds of a developing country? Or perhaps you're most concerned about products that harm the environment \u2013 in which case choose between bets on food prices or on the extraction of uranium. Each toxic option comes with its own special reason why it is the most dangerous financial product on the continent. The survey is the brainchild of German MEP Sven Giegold, whose stated aim is to let in more daylight on a notoriously murky and under-regulated sub-industry. But he also raises an important point: we wouldn't let a drugs company launch a new antibiotic without full tests \u2013 why should finance be any different? Today is the last day to vote; we are assured that the winner will get no prizes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
