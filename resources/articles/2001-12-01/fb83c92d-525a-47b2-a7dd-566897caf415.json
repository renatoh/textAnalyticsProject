A favourite of such auteurs as Cameron Crowe (he stars opposite Tom Cruise in the upcoming Vanilla Sky) and Lawrence Kasdan, 31-year-old Lee is still most closely associated with the sultan of scruff, Kevin Smith, who gave him his first serious acting job in Mallrats. In Smith's latest outrage, Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back, Lee reprises two of his previous roles, Mallrats' tart-tongued Brodie and Chasing Amy's duplicitous Banky. As his own star rises, Lee admits he'll always enjoy getting back with the bad influence who gave him his break. We can only thank the movie gods for that. What would you say this movie represents in terms of Kevin's development as a film-maker? Well, he says he's regressing. I don't really know if Kevin has to advance as a film-maker. That's not what he's into. He's into dick and fart jokes. Honestly, I think it's the idea of making people laugh, entertaining them. If the film does that, it doesn't need to be fancy and tricky. I think he's a film-maker for the people. But he's not dumb. This movie may have its corny, wacky scenarios and an orang utan and stuff, but Kevin doesn't ever need to rely on what other comedies have to have, because he has that backbone of dialogue in his writing, and it's people communicating the way people communicate. Did you approach this as a chance to develop new aspects of either character? No, that's too deep. I just do what Kevin tells me to do. But I did feel some closure at the end, although I'm surprised Banky doesn't die a horrible death. Kevin wants to revive the Fletch franchise with you in the Chevy Chase position. Is that going to happen? We'll see. I'm not really famous, and studios don't like to put non-famous people in lead roles. It would be so hard not to do Chevy, though; that's my real concern. You shot your Jay And Silent Bob scenes during days off from Vanilla Sky. Was it difficult shuttling between the two? Vanilla Sky was a little more intense. It had a bigger budget and was a more complicated film to make. It felt like you were making a movie with friends, but it was more stressful. Obviously, this kind of movie is \"you're in, you're out.\" Do you skate much anymore? No. Can't really do it while I'm working. If I get hurt, I get in trouble. I'm pretty damn rusty, anyway; it's not like I'm going to compete anytime soon. But when I was shooting Vanilla Sky, I played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 game almost every day. I got so addicted; it's so cool. Skateboarding is unusual training for an acting career, to say the least. How do you go about learning and improving? You work on the same movie every day for two months, you find your groove. I think the idea is to just ask questions and get as much understanding as you can. You build a solid foundation and work from that. You don't seem to have bought into the Hollywood careerism aspect of it, though. Do you thank your skating roots for that? Just about everything you see or hear is true. It's crazy; I don't really swim with many sharks. I just try to keep a low profile and choose the best work that I can."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
