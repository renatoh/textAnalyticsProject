Radcliffe, who clutched the back of her left leg in pain as she came home, said that Britain's head coach, Charles van Commenee, had advised her in May to write this year off and rest but she denied suggestions that, at 35, the defeat signalled a decline in her career. \"I certainly don't feel that,\" said the world record holder. \"OK, I had a bad race today and I was injured [but] I still think there's a long way to go. I've had some bad luck this year but I don't think it's because I'm old.\" Radcliffe had complained of a \"niggle\" in her left knee ahead of the race but had dismissed it as a minor problem. In truth she was suffering from tendinitis, a residual effect from a hamstring problem earlier in the year, but chose to hide the full extent of the injury to prevent her competitors from exploiting the advantage. \"We thought the risk was going to be the first mile because it's been bothering me going uphill, so that's why I didn't want to say too much because, if other people had legged it the first mile, it could have gone then. I knew I was fit coming in, then at 11 miles it just went. For the last miles I was just thinking 'hang in there' as long as I could. Just try to stay with them.\" The world's best female marathon runner is becoming as well known for her injury problems as for her achievements, and back in May van Commenee, had advised her to rest for the rest of the year. Yesterday Radcliffe admitted that perhaps she should have followed his advice but she could not resist the temptation of racing. \"Had things gone well for me this year I might have let this race go but it was something really important to me just to get out and race after all the work. I really thought it was going to work out and once I was in the race there was no way I was going to drop out unless it really got so sore.\" On top of all the other problems Radcliffe has faced this year \u2013 a bunion operation in February, hamstring tendinitis ahead of the world championships, tonsillitis before the world half-marathon championships in Birmingham \u2013 did she really ever believe that she could win? \"I knew it was a risk,\" she said, \"because, if the injury came back I was going to run like I did, but I totally believe that, if it hadn't come, I would have had a chance. \"The race wasn't run in a really fast time. It was a risk that I wouldn't take had I had a good year's racing but I'd done all the hard work, it was here in New York and I had a good feeling that it was going to work out.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
