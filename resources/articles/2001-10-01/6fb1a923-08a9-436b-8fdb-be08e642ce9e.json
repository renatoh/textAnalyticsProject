In a sense, this 80th-birthday tribute has come 20 years too late: Arnold is a frail figure, apparently indifferent to the sudden flurry of interest around him. Twenty years ago, however, this modest but devoted celebration of his music would not have been thought of for a moment. Arnold's career was blighted by negative criticism, with the progressive wing of the musical establishment branding his music anachronistic. That stigma has been so hard to shake off that his nine symphonies are still almost unknown. Arnold's overtures and dance suites have probably made him as many enemies as friends. The Tam O'Shanter Overture and Four Scottish Dances rank among the best of his lighter works, but even so, their unremitting jokiness, all Scotch snaps and tipsy bassoon solos, can be wearing. But they do demonstrate an energy and rare gift for melody that blossoms in performances as vibrant as these. Rumon Gamba's enthusiasm would have won over the most hardened modernist. One of the best things about Arnold's symphonies is the complete absence of any programme: this is music as abstract as any 1960s graphic score. Both the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies make use of a wide spectrum of popular music, ranging from the Westerns credits-rolling sound in the Sixth's finale to the horrible muzak of the Fifth's scherzo. The effect is electrifyingly bizarre in the context of his otherwise conservative style. On the basis of Gamba's performance, the Fifth Symphony is one of Arnold's masterpieces. Although there will still be a few who find its Mahlerian slow-movement theme embarrassing, the critical disgust originally voiced at its return in triumphal mode at the symphony's end was misjudged. It deliberately rings hollow, to end in a mood of despair. Gamba's handling of that moment was intensely moving."}, "isHosted": false}}}
