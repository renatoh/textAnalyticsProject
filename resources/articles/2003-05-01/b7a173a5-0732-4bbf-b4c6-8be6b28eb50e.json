Our multiform, our infinite Scotland small ?\" Over the past dozen years, Robert Crawford has devoted much industry to soothing MacDiarmid's incredulity. Crawford specialises in poems about Scottish places and people, eulogising not only literary figures but scientists and engineers, such as Henry Bell, James Clerk Maxwell and John Logie Baird, men associated with railways, steam and primitive models of the television. The native genius blends with native chippiness in lines such as: \"When World War II ended / Baird equipment broadcast victory in the Savoy / But not one diner said cheerio when you faded\". MacDiarmid's later poetry was marked by the use of technical jargon, and Crawford follows his example, deploying \"holophotal lenses\", \"oxyhydrogen\", \"electromagnetism\" and the like. But he skips daintily around his mentor's giantism. Where MacDiarmid's late verse blustered as it bam-boozled, in Crawford's, \"Cybernetics whistles 'Auld Lang Syne'.\" A poem called \"Double Helix\" wittily winds back on itself, so that the second half mirrors the first and the ending is linked to the beginning. While Crawford never hobbles into doggerel (MacDiarmid: \"Praise be we're in a better position / Thanks, of course, to nuclear fission\"), he confronts the same challenge of hewing a speakable line out of a technical mouthful: \"The painter will later invent / The compression rivet and work out the axial arrangement / Between propeller and engine.\" It is, after all, the dialect of one particular Scottish tribe. There is a political, not to say breast-beating, overtone to this, of course. No need to ask where Crawford's politics live: they are doing a country dance all over his verse. In his first book, A Scottish Assembly (1990), a poem called \"Scotland\" was followed by another also called \"Scotland\", and then by the title poem, \"A Scottish Assembly\" (added to those were \"Inner Glasgow\", \"Edinburgh\", \"Dunoon\", \"Cambuslang\" and \"The Land o' Cakes\"). The Tip of My Tongue , his fifth collection, opens with a Whitmanesque paean, \"Fiat Lux\", which makes mention of \"new parliaments\", in the process of celebrating universal variety and renewal. The following poem, \"Credo\", written in the year of the opening of the Scottish parliament, 1999, ends with a \"declaration of dependence\" addressed to the poet's wife, which might also be spoken to his country. It is one of the likable features of Crawford's poetry that he endeavours to express \"the whole man\": in the ideal poem's field of vision, love and sex, biology and invention, artistic inspiration and the rebirth of a nation, would coalesce in a single apprehension. He is an intellectual poet with a delight in paradox and contradiction, but an ample gratitude for earthly delight. Like Mac-Diarmid again (and Whitman), he is fond of lists, and lists of place-names in particular. Every other poem in The Tip of My Tongue zooms from place to place, whether it's \"From whitening Great Barrier Reef / To the drawdown of the Ogallala\" or \"From Blantyre tae Blantyre, Malawi\" (or Perth, Australia, to Perth, Perthshire) or \"Through vennels, kennels, bennels, shrines and hoolies / From California to Moscow, Ayrshire\". This tune, sung time and again, begins to sound repetitive; as does the prosodic negotiation of cumbersome syllables. Aberdeen's tenements are \"Howked out of the Rubislaw Quarry's / Undiamandiferous granite\". \"A Good Address\" cites \"El Greco's Toledo, shining over water, / A Scoto-Spanish, kirky Tir nan Og\". The verbal dexterity, which sometimes gives the impression of being rather pleased with itself, is at its most effective when kept simple. A poem called \"Windfarming\", for example, takes an inquisitive look at that odd \"agribusiness of the air\": While everything is speeding up, Overheating, hurtling away, Good to stand still on this moonlit upland, Canny, uncanny, with a choir of angels Towering above us, beating their wings, Piloting the earth on its way. In one or two poems, Crawford nods with serious intent towards Older Scots, but mostly contents himself with a sprinkling of dialect words in otherwise standard English lines - perjink, stravaiging, thrawn and so on. Although modern Scottish speech is lightly peppered in this way, such usage runs the risk of seeming couthie, or twee, when the intention, presumably, is to sound all the more natural. The obscure 18th-century Scots word \"blash\", meaning a splash or a shower of rain, gets three outings in this book, thus drawing attention to itself in a way that would be called \"showing off\" in other contexts. He is also fond of locutions such as \"sing-songily\" and \"eastcoasty\". Crawford has always wished to share his joy in his native land, and it is heartening to find somebody keen to thrill to the Scottish weather (no poet has ever loved a downpour as much), but he feels the need to drum home the point: \"I love all windy, grand designs, all blashes\" (\"Planetis\"); \"I love the North East / Everywhere of it\" (\"Arbuthnott\"); \"I love how it comes right out of the blue / North Sea\" (\"St Andrews\"); \"I love your hard core, Marischal College\" (\"Aberdeen\"). Few would begrudge such affirmations, though some might wish to hear the devotional hymn sung in a different key now and then (there is also marriage - \"I love the bigamy of it\" - and writing: \"I love it, the mouth music's make and break\"). The best set of poems in The Tip of My Tongue is a group of translations from the Latin of the 17th-century Aberdeenshire poet Arthur Johnston, a genuine find. Crawford provides \"free, modern versions\" of four Johnston poems, one of which is \"Birthplace\": I sprang from this, these rivers, fields Over a hundred generations Always the Howe of the Johnstons. Virgil made his birthplace famous; Mine will the making of my poems. These lines express a similar motivation to that which spurs many of the poems in the book, but, \"free\" or not, they possess a modesty which is otherwise often felt to be lacking. Johnston may yet become Crawford's less self-satisfied persona. On the occasions when a shadow darkens the poet's vision, his lines take on a new type of interest, as in a poem which appears to have been inspired by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth: \"I am the bad shepherd, torching my flocks in the fields, / Feeding them accelerant . . . / Every sheep is a black sheep in that fire\". Crawford, who has written many works of criticism and who teaches at the University of St Andrews, is one of the busiest men in contemporary Scottish letters. A surprising number of the poems in his new book result from commissions, for which everyone gets thanked: \"The Auld Enemy\", a poem of 25 lines, was \"commissioned with support from the University of St Andrews Scottish Studies Institute and the Scottish Arts Council, was part of BBC Radio 3's Heaven-Taught Fergusson series produced by Dave Batchelor, and appeared in my edited book Heaven-Taught Fergusson . . .\" Still he finds the time, \"some days\", to \"throw my voice / Deep down the larynx of Glen Esk // Ears cocked to catch what rumbles back\". Whatever does is still on the tip of his tongue. \u00b7 James Campbell is a former editor of the Edinburgh Review."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
