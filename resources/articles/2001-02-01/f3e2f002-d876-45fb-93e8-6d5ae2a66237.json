So much so that he hailed the 31-year-old Dennis Bergkamp almost as a new signing after the Dutchman delivered a rare goal. Multiply Arsenal's concerns fivefold, and the sum of Gordon Strachan's worries come into sight. Strachan insisted afterwards that his team had \"recovered their pride\", but their weakness in front of goal illustrated precisely why Coventry gambled in reviving the pursuit of John Hartson, only to miss this target again. Wenger has suffered different frustrations, but at least Arsenal are still shooting for the FA Cup and Europe, even if the title might as well be the moon. Wenger looked a relieved man, not only because he is still free to fine-tune tactics from the touchline but also because Arsenal travelled successfully for the first time since early November. And even if Bergkamp, like this team, operated in fits and starts, at least he scored - a relative rarity for any Arsenal striker in the league these days. Thierry Henry was rested on Saturday, said to be suffering thigh trouble, though his own goal block could equally have been cited. Wenger has long been counting the lost championship opportunities; Coventry may soon be counting the cost of relegation. But Strachan is determined he will not be the manager vilified for losing top-flight status after 34 years. \"This is Coventry - we've been in tighter spots than this before,\" he said. \"Once in my time we were 9-1 on to go down.\" But the odds are shortening with his side now five points away from the safety zone. Before the match Coventry's chairman Bryan Richardson was crunching different numbers. He offered a vote of confidence in his manager: \"If the board were not 1,000% behind Gordon, you would have to see the matter differently. We don't feel there is any problem in that area. We support Gordon, and we will support Gordon, in every way.\" Would Strachan still be manager if relegated? \"I don't expect that to happen,\" said Richardson. \"That's a hypothetical question and that's how it will have to remain.\" If Coventry do fall, then Richardson will partly blame English football's transfer-fee and player-wage inflation. \"We invested a few years ago heavily in players and in the stadium. We believed we would climb into the eighth-12th [position] bracket. But the price of many players, the whole package, is now astronomical.\" He could have noted that there is no guarantee even when Coventry lay out a club-record \u00a36.5m for Craig Bellamy, which is only half the fee paid by Arsenal for Sylvain Wiltord. Both strikers have been called expensive flops, even if Wenger made reassuring noises about Wiltord. \"He's getting more and more used to the English game ... he's looking more the player I invested so much money in.\" Yet he has not scored a Premiership goal for over three months. But Bergkamp and Wiltord, said Wenger, currently lack confidence although that notion was briefly dispelled 12 minutes from the end of a poor game. Wiltord crossed for Bergkamp, aided by Magnus Hedman's headlong rush and two defenders' in attention, to glance home a rare headed goal - for the Dutchman and for Arsenal. Coventry by then were spent, counting the cost of physical endeavour in the first half and misses by David Thompson, Bellamy and John Eustace. Neither the team nor their fans, applauding sympathetically at the end, could overly complain because Arsenal were denied a penalty before the interval when Thompson handled - an injustice that saw Wenger remonstrating with the fourth official. Strachan set his side a 17-point target for safety before this latest setback, although, upbeat as ever, he suggested 15 points \"might do it\". That is also still the gap between Arsenal and Manchester United but Wenger is not revising his estimates. The only chance for anyone, he said, is that United \"go on holiday and come back for the last day maybe\". Wenger has conceded title defeat, and his team may also now struggle in the FA Cup. Tony Adams and Ray Parlour will miss the fifth-round tie with Chelsea after being booked here, as was Patrick Vieira, his first caution in 25 games since his suspension early this season. On Thursday Vieira faces a further ban if the FA find him guilty of alleged misdemeanours caught on camera in a league match at Leeds in November. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
