Lewis-Francis, 19, the world and European junior 100 metres champion, was stunned to learn that a warrant had been issued for his arrest. He might have to return to Britain today which could jeopardise his appearance in the champi onships which start tomorrow. He and his team-mate Jason Gardener were expected to contest the gold medal. UK Athletics faxed documentation to Wolverhampton magistrates after learning about Lewis-Francis's predictament to say he was with them representing his country. But it does not expect to hear back from the court until this morning when Lewis-Francis might be ordered to return home. He is due to make his debut as a senior at an international championships, running in the 60m which starts on Saturday lunchtime. Lewis-Francis said: \"In the summer of 2001, I pleaded guilty by post to the offence of driving without a full licence. I've heard nothing since and I'm mystified by today's summons.\" UKA would not confirm other charges which are understood to be driving with no insurance, no MOT, failing to produce documentation and driving through a red light. A UKA statement said: \"We were unaware that Mark Lewis-Francis was due to appear in court today and have submitted paperwork to the court explaining that he was travelling to Vienna.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
