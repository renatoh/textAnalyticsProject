What is surprising is that President George Bush and Dick Cheney, the vice president ... go on campaigning on the false pretence that their Iraq policy has been a success ... The suicide bombs, roadside bombs, ambushes, kidnappings, and assassinations - all these assaults on Iraqis and foreigners show a nation in violent disorder. This continuing mayhem, which casts doubt on the possibility of holding elections ... in January 2005, also casts light on the unmistakable failures of the Bush administration's efforts at peacemaking and nation-building in postwar Iraq.\" Musa Keilani Jordan Times, September 19 \"One did not need the 'secret and confidential' US intelligence report projecting a bleak future for Iraq, with a civil war not being ruled out, to realise that things are going wrong wholesale for Washington in Iraq ... We know that the US plan for January elections in Iraq is in deep trouble in view of the deteriorating security situation and the stiff challenge the Iraqi resistance is putting up against the American presence there. We know that, as every day passes, the US is making more enemies in Iraq than friends ... \"What the Iraqis need now is stability and security first, and democracy later. The US will not be able to give them that no matter what tactics it adopts.\" Washington Post Editorial, September 19 \"Unless [the Bush administration] can find ways to improve security in the coming weeks, its larger strategy for the country, which begins with elections planned for January, may unravel ... \"Grand illusions have too often guided Mr Bush in Iraq. We believed the president was right to confront the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, and like the vast majority of Iraqis, we welcomed the removal of that murderous regime. Yet even before the war it seemed to us that Mr Bush was failing to recognise, or prepare for, the fact that the postwar reconstruction of Iraq would be long, difficult and dangerous ... Too often American soldiers and commanders have been flung into the breach between illusion and reality. Many have responded with great courage ... but more than 1,000 have died, thousands more as well have paid a terrible cost and no end to these losses is in sight ... Mr Bush deserves to be judged by this record. In our view, it is one of courage in setting goals and steadfastness in sticking to them, but also one of extraordinary recklessness and incompetence in execution.\" Scotland on Sunday Editorial, September 19 \"We may never know who was behind [Saturday's] leak of [secret UK memos] that blew the lid on the thinking at the heart of Tony Blair's government as plans were made to topple Saddam, but these particular revelations take their place among some of the most dramatic in modern history ... A year before Britain joined the attack on Saddam, the prime minister was told by the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, that no one could predict the outcome ... \"We now know in chilling detail of the almost impossible dilemma that faced Mr Blair as it became clear that nothing was going to stop Mr Bush going to war ... In the end Mr Blair ... took a deep breath and lined-up with the US. That is a decision the prime minister will have to justify at the ballot box ... Tragically, what the papers can't do is point to a way out from the anarchy that Mr Bush has created and the predicted years of chaos have come to pass. A good time for defence cuts? We think not.\" Independent on Sunday Editorial, September 19 \"A year before the invasion of Iraq [Mr Straw] commented: 'There seems to be a larger hole in this than anything.' Yet into that hole Mr Bush and Mr Blair fell, and ... now, a year and a half after the invasion, the situation in Iraq is worse than the pessimists in the Foreign Office could have imagined, and getting worse ... The idea that Iraq is proceeding along a pre-set timetable towards democracy is a fantasy ... \"There is no point in opponents of the war saying that we told them so. Nor would it be right to call for British and US troops to be withdrawn from Iraq ... to pull out now would ensure that the country was taken over by a dictator or several dictators, probably after an even more bloody phase than the present one ... Having started on this disastrous course, the US and Britain have no choice but to see it through.\" Mark Steyn Sunday Telegraph, September 19 \"After the predictions of hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths and a mass refugee crisis and a humanitarian catastrophe and wall-to-wall cholera and dysentery all failed to pan out, the naysayers fell back on predictions of imminent civil war. But the civil war's as mythical as the universal dysentery. There is a problem in the Sunni triangle and in certain Baghdad suburbs ... [But] in two-thirds of the country, municipal government has been rebuilt, business is good, restaurants are open, life is as jolly as it has been in living memory.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
