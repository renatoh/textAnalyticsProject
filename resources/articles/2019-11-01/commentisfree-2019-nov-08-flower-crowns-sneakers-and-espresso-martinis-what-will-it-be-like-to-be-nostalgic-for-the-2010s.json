What will now look like later? Let\u2019s pretend it\u2019s 2042 and you\u2019re invited to a 2010s-themed party. Venue The venue is an \u201cAirbnb\u201d decorated in white tiles with a splash of green from indoor plants hanging from crocheted slings. The wood is blonde. When they enter, guests are saged. In the \u201cBasic zone\u201d are Kmart prints with the words \u201cLove, Create, Smile, Home\u201d in curly writing. In another room there is a wall of street art and an old-timey street artist painting in the style of the Old Master, Banksy. People joke that they caught an Uber. To drink On arrival there is a choice of 2010s-themed alcohol: Aperol spritz, negroni, prosecco, rose, orange wine, espresso martinis and hyper-local small batch gin or craft beer. You can also get coffee, and dotted around the party are people dressed as the beloved 2010s icon, the hipster barista \u2013 with butcher\u2019s aprons, massive beards and sleeve tattoos. We love it that people brought \u201ckeep cups\u201d from the era, that they found in antique stores. For those choosing not to drink (a very late 2010s thing, assure the hosts), there\u2019s medical marijuana or LSD microdosing available. Also: coconut water, green juice and various types of fake milks: cashew, almond, coconut, soy and macadamia. Food Guests are served avocado halves on a plate with a piece of toast, wedge of lemon and smear of salt. \u201cWhat the hell do I do with this?\u201d one guest is heard to say. Later in the night salmon poke bowls are brought out by people with Deliveroo bags, but otherwise it\u2019s mostly Mexican, cronuts, burgers, share plates and vegan food. A small number of partygoers dressed as swole muscle bros elect to consume protein powder or food sourced in the tradition of \u201cpaleo\u201d or combined in the tradition of \u201cketo\u201d. (The bulletproof coffee gets a lot of laughs.) Clothes Boiler suits, jumpsuits, metallics, peplum pieces, maxi dresses, bike shorts, linen, salmon pink shirts for men, short shorts, sneakers instead of stilettos, flower crowns and athleisure (of course). There is no-makeup makeup, contouring and people walk around wearing Korean face masks. Other people wear costumes \u2013 there are dozens of Elsas from Frozen and Kardashians. Some of the guests look strange, cartoonish almost. They wear exaggerated, stuck-on eyelashes and have painted their eyebrows three inches thick. Their faces have the alien look which we know to be a thing they used to call \u201cfillers\u201d, and under their clothes they\u2019ve stuffed fake bum implants. Some of the men arrive with Ned Kellys (large, but carefully maintained beards) or hair in a high topknot which they used to call a \u201cman bun\u201d (and we are embarrassed for the people of that era). Some are dressed as people in professions that no longer exist: Instagram poets, social media managers and emoji designers. Others have brought pets from the era \u2013 English bulldogs and Labradoodles were popular. Everyone is dancing to grime, alt country and trap music as well as the massive solo stars of the decade. Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, Ed Sheeran and Adele are all on high rotation, along with Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989. Accessories Since being banned by President Donald Trump at the end of the decade, vaping has gone underground. So in a smoky cloud of nostalgia that feels very 2017, vapers inhale a cinnamon and strawberry donut flavoured Juul. There\u2019s an alarming number of people seemingly aimlessly doing laps around the perimeter of the party. On closer inspection they are all wearing a strange band on their wrists called a Fitbit and measuring their steps. \u201cWe have to get to 12,000.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just an arbitrary number we were given.\u201d Other guests have brought along their selfie sticks and personal drones or very old iPhones (which were enormous back then). They are taking hundreds of photos of themselves at all different angles (weird! gross! why??!!) which they jokingly say they will upload to the now defunct platform of Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m an influencer!\u201d they say to howls of laughter. Activities Guests are offered this thing called a \u201cclass pass\u201d and can choose between typical 2010s-era activities \u2013 crossfit, F45, barre, SoulCycle, standup paddleboarding or power yoga. You can have a gut health check and a (fake) faecal transplant. In another room is a screen with astrology apps, and you can pay for your chart using old-fashioned cryptocurrency. There is a room with buckets and disinfectant for people having an experience with ayahuasca and another room for people taking something called the \u201cice bucket challenge\u201d \u2013 and who are pointlessly being filmed on one of those stupid large phones while doing so. On screens set up around the party are nonstop cooking shows. It makes you think, life must have been really shit if you didn\u2019t stream in the 2010s. But some grim, monotonous show called MasterChef is in a way preferable to the documentary showing earlier \u2013 Kony 2012 \u2013 which looks truly deranged, but was apparently very popular at the time. As an alternative you can listen to a podcast via your airpods. There is some darkness visible at the edges of the party \u2013 after all, it was the 2010s. In the corner are people looking distressed and out of sorts. \u201cThat\u2019s the cancelled corner,\u201d says the host. \u201cAll the people that got cancelled go there \u2013 so people that sent a racist tweet, made a rape joke or accidentally liked something posted by an alt-right account.\u201d There is also a dank corner for the trolls (bathed in laptop light) and another area for those who have been ghosted. The people in that area are compulsively checking their phones. Life was cruel, we observe, glad we weren\u2019t born then.
