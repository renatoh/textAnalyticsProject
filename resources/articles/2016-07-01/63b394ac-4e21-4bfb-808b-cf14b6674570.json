Only the truly committed will wade through every one of the 2.6 million words in the bloated report authored by Sir John Chilcot and his committee. The seven years they have taken to produce their findings is longer than the six years British troops were present in Iraq. Most people, including many who originally supported the removal of the monstrous Saddam Hussein, had already come to their own conclusions that the invasion was sold on a false prospectus and the appallingly inadequate preparations for the aftermath doomed Iraq to a grisly fate. Chilcot\u2019s service is to gather a vast amount of testimony and publish secret documents, especially private communications from Tony Blair to George W Bush, that would not otherwise see the light of day for many years, if ever. That ought to be highly valuable to policymakers and future historians. 2 Why can\u2019t Tony Blair just admit the war was a mistake? He has repeatedly expressed regret about the loss of life, both British service personnel and Iraqi casualties. In the marathon news conference he staged in response to Chilcot, the former prime minister sounded throaty, looked crushed and acknowledged some errors. He now concedes that he ought to have been much more challenging about the so-called intelligence which was used to justify the invasion, though he can\u2019t bring himself to admit that he didn\u2019t properly interrogate the intelligence because he was desperate for it to support the pro-war conclusion he had already come to. He has also accepted that he should have asked many more questions about whether the allies were prepared for what would happen after the toppling of Saddam. What he can\u2019t bring himself to say is: \u201cIf I knew then what I know now, of course I would never have taken Britain to war in Iraq.\u201d Some react to his defiance by putting it down to self-delusion, denial and vanity. The most important reason is this: for Blair to accept that the entire enterprise was a mistake would be to say to the bereaved that their loved ones died in vain for a terrible folly. 3 Did Blair secretly commit himself to war earlier? A lot of the instant reaction to Chilcot focused on a note written by Blair in late July 2002 which he begins by promising Bush \u201cI will be with you, whatever\u201d. This blank cheque to the American president horrified British diplomats who saw the note at the time and its existence had already been revealed in books about the war. The \u201cwhatever\u201d is then followed by a series of \u201cbuts\u201d from Blair setting out conditions that needed to be met before they attempted the removal of Saddam. This happened at several stages on the road to war. The \u201cwhatever\u201d was designed to win Bush\u2019s trust and ear. The trouble is that it meant that the president took it for granted that Blair would support him whether or not his conditions were satisfied. Andrew Card, Bush\u2019s chief of staff, later told me that, from the time of the Crawford ranch meeting at Easter 2002, the Americans took it as a given that Britain would join military action. Colin Powell, the US Secretary of State, assumed the same. 4 Did Blair lie his way into war? Ever since the invasion, countless protesters, placards and web posters have called him \u201cBliar\u201d because he made Saddam\u2019s alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction his main justification for the war and those weapons did not exist. We now know \u2013 in fact, we have known for a long time \u2013 that the intelligence about WMD was nearly all wrong and much of it was pure fiction. To take just one of many examples, the Iraqi army never had the capability to fire WMD within 45 minutes of an order to do so. Indeed, all Saddam\u2019s WMD had gone by the time of the invasion and were probably secretly destroyed by the Iraqis after the 1990-91 Gulf war. Those who want to believe the simplest explanation \u2013 that Blair just made it all up \u2013 have been disappointed by Chilcot. He acquits Blair and his closest advisers of \u201csexing up\u201d the infamous dossier published in autumn 2002, one of the few points of satisfaction for Blair in an otherwise damning report. Chilcot lays the blame on MI6. The spies over-promised about their ability to gather reliable intelligence from within Saddam\u2019s Stalinist regime. The agency realised that one of its key sources was a fabricator even before the invasion, but Chilcot says MI6 kept this concealed not just from the public, but also from Blair. Blair had been given warnings, including from senior members of his own staff, that much of the intelligence seemed stale, thin or flaky and did not support a case that Saddam was an imminent threat. His culpability was to use his trademark evangelism to represent the bogus intelligence as compelling evidence that Saddam was a real, present and growing danger when he was not. 5 Was the war illegal? Chilcot concludes that the legal basis for the invasion was \u201cfar from satisfactory\u201d and confirms that the cabinet never tested the advice from the attorney-general after he had an eleventh-hour change of mind. The report fails to offer a verdict on whether the war was unlawful on the grounds that the committee is not qualified to judge. The invasion did not have the explicit sanction from the United Nations that Blair had sought: the fabled \u201csecond resolution\u201d for which he fought frantically but in vain. On the other hand, the war was never condemned by a vote of the UN and the occupation was subsequently given a form of endorsement in post-invasion resolutions passed by the Security Council creating a framework for Iraq\u2019s future. The International Criminal Court hasn\u2019t the jurisdiction to rule if the conflict as a whole was illegal. It can prosecute individuals for war crimes, even if they were not present on the battlefield. Some of the bereaved families want to see Blair in a dock and lawyers suggest he could face criminal prosecution in Britain under the 19th-century law on \u201cmisconduct in public office\u201d. Nationalist parties have suggested that he could be tried by parliament using the ancient procedure of \u201cimpeachment\u201d, last activated in 1806. 6Could the war have been stopped? Up to the cusp of the invasion, key members of the cabinet could have acted to stop British participation in the invasion. Any one of John Prescott, deputy prime minister at the time; Gordon Brown, chancellor; and Jack Straw, foreign secretary, could have halted it by resigning. While all the focus has been on Blair, it is important to remember that his senior colleagues had it in their power to halt the march to war and didn\u2019t. The late Robin Cook was the only member of the cabinet to quit and his resignation speech has been richly vindicated by subsequent revelations and events. With varying degrees of enthusiasm or reluctance, the rest of the cabinet went along with it, Clare Short included. It is also worth recalling that the diplomatic, military and intelligence establishment signed up for the war \u2013 the military were especially keen to maximise the British contribution \u2013 whatever they later said when it went horribly wrong. Most of the press backed the removal of Saddam, as did the Tory opposition and the majority of public opinion at the time of the invasion. Even had Britain stayed out of it, the war would have happened because Bush was so determined on it. 7Why were the allies so ill-prepared for the aftermath? The conventional war in Iraq was won easily, with relatively low casualties and at an astonishing pace. Saddam was toppled in less than a month. It was the aftermath that went catastrophically wrong. Blair insists this could not have been foreseen. Chilcot rejects that excuse, and rightly so. The danger that the fall of Saddam would unleash sectarian conflict in Iraq was both predictable and predicted. Bush, who displayed breathtaking ignorance about the country he was invading, simply didn\u2019t want to know about it. Tony Blair didn\u2019t want to think about it until it was too late. After a private pre-war warning from the French president, Jacques Chirac, that invaders would not be welcomed as liberators, Blair turned to an aide, rolled his eyes and said: \u201cPoor old, Jacques. He just doesn\u2019t get it, does he?\u201d As it turned out, Chirac had \u201cgot it\u201d about would happen in Iraq better than Blair or Bush. The post-invasion failures to establish order and maintain essential services destroyed the myth of allied military invincibility and betrayed the promise to Iraqis that they would have a better life. Violent factions multiplied in the vacuum. Iran intervened. Abolishing the Iraqi army put 400,000 discontented former soldiers on the streets. Chilcot is withering about the performance of the British military. Initially complacent about the southern provinces under its control, the army was ultimately forced into an abject retreat from Basra. The cost in blood and treasure was enormous. 8 Did the war lead to Isis? It is often contended that the invasion of Iraq fanned the flames of conflict across the Middle East. Blair has responded that, had Saddam and his sons not been removed from power in 2003, conflict would have later erupted in Iraq anyway because the Arab spring triggered a cascade of uprisings against tyrannical regimes. This happened in Egypt, Libya and Syria so his counter-factual is plausible. Publication of Chilcot has also amplified claims that the war fuelled the rise of Isis and detonated the conflict in Syria. Martin Chulov, our Middle East editor and author of a definitive study of Isis, responds: \u201cThe Syrian civil war was not driven by Isis. It fed directly out of the Arab awakenings and was a bid to oust a ruthless regime from power. Assad could not have prevailed against the will of the streets. So he tried to transform the uprising into something that was driven by internationally-backed global jihad. Isis grew out of the chaos. They flourished with Assad\u2019s direct and indirect support until they became a monster no one could control.\u201d 9 Are lessons being learned? Whitehall had early sight of the report and sources say that some lessons are already being applied. The false intelligence was the gravest failure in the history of the Secret Intelligence Service, worse even than the penetration of MI6 by the Cambridge spy ring in the early years of the cold war. Much of the blame is attributed to the eagerness of Sir Richard Dearlove, the head of MI6, to please a hungry prime minister by going directly to No 10 to feed supposedly \u201chot\u201d intelligence to the boss before it had been tested. It is now said that there is much more robust separation between those gathering intelligence and those assessing it, and new firewalls have been placed between the spies and the politicians. 10 Could an Iraq war ever happen again? That seems unlikely after the defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some policy thinkers worry there could be a sound case for intervention in the future and it won\u2019t happen because the scars are so deep. Strategy is a mess. After the horrors in Iraq, Britain, with France and America, took a different approach when genocide was threatened by Colonel Gaddafi in Libya, using air power but not deploying troops. That form of intervention-lite has turned out badly. The failings in Iraq and Libya resulted in reluctance to intervene in Syria when anti-regime protesters rose up against the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad. Even when he unleashed chemical weapons on civilians, parliament refused to sanction British intervention at the first time of asking. More Syrians have died since that conflict began in 2011 than Iraqis have died since the invasion of 2003. Non-intervention can be every bit as blood-stained as intervention."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
