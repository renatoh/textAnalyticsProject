But while attention focused on the demise of the Merseyside soap, the Channel 4 chief executive called David Brook into his office to discuss how he, too, would be written out of the plot. It is unlikely to have come as a surprise. Thompson's \"back to basics\" pronouncements in the six months since he took over have been geared to unpicking the Michael Jackson legacy, of which Brook was a key architect. It must have seemed to Thompson as if Jackson himself were still around. Thompson seems determined to distance himself from the Jackson years, with talk of refocusing on the core business and \"building a channel from scratch\". The strategy has led to a dramatic turnaround in perception: when Jackson left, the obituaries detailed five years of astonishing success; now, those same five years are talked of as monuments to failed profligacy. The turnaround has been most evident at Channel 4 headquarters, where last week's announcement of up to 200 job cuts plunged staff into despair. Despite the channel enjoying a record share of the peak-time audience, staff have lost their self-confidence. As any student of management theory could tell you, it is easy to destroy a successful business; far more difficult to save an ailing one. Advertisers are confused. Nick Theakstone, investment director at ad buying agency MindShare, says: \"We are seeing headlines about Channel 4 losing its way, and that's not something we are used to. But if you look at how it has performed over the past 20 years, it has performed pretty fantastically.\" The Jackson regime is now routinely characterised as recklessly expansionist; yet supporters say that ventures such as Big Brother were built around the strength of the main channel. The terms of Brook's settlement with Channel 4 now prevent him from talking, but he denied last week that he has been made the fall guy for a failed strategy. \"The bulk of the comment has been on the creative side,\" he told MediaGuardian.co.uk. Yet those who have worked with Brook insist that his approach to marketing is inextricably linked to editorial judgments. He pushed through the acquisition of Test cricket rights because he saw it as a commercial opportunity; he backed Film Four's launch because he saw it as an extension of the Channel 4 brand. One senior broadcasting figure with inside knowledge of Channel 4 decision-making says: \"Brook is a clever opportunist - always saying, 'Why doesn't Channel 4 do this or that?'. But it's difficult to call that a strategy. There is a world of difference between seizing an opportunity and having a long-term strategy.\" Strategist or opportunist, Brook - a former marketing director at both the Guardian and Channel 5 - prospered under Jackson. They shared an expansionist vision, a strategy intended to make Channel 4 more than the sum of its parts. There were accolades: the entertainment channel E4 is seen as one of the most successful launches of a digital service. Within a year of its launch in 2000 it became the number three entertainment channel, behind Sky One and UK Gold (although the recent rise of ITV2 is threatening that position). But while E4 is ahead of its business plan, which envisaged \u00a380m investment over five years by Channel 4, the strategy was drawn up in a \"time of plenty\". And there have been failures: Channel 4's involvement in the attheraces venture has proved to be a millstone. Few believe the attheraces channel can ever provide a return, yet the solid \"Channel 4 Racing\" brand on the terrestrial network has been ditched for the attheraces nomenclature. The opportunism worked when Channel 4 was raking in ad revenue; now Thompson has to make it work in a tougher environment. \"Everything David did was in an era of plenty; you need a different approach now in more straitened times,\" the senior source says. Channel 4 is at a creative crossroads. Kevin Lygo, former head of entertainment at Channel 4 and now director of programmes at Channel 5, could not resist some cheap jibes at a Broadcasting Press Guild lunch last week. But his fundamental analysis, that Channel 4's \"normal high standards have slipped\" due to a \"lack of confidence\", is widely shared. The key task for Thompson will restoring that creative confidence while maintaining financial stability. Although he got a rough ride from the media at the launch of his winter schedule last week, advertisers are more sanguine. Theakstone says: \"Thompson has made some tough choices, reshaping the business and talking about returning to the core. The detractors of ITV say it has never really sorted out its problems, but Channel 4 is pretty light of foot, it has identified what's wrong and is doing something about it. I see a pretty rosy future for it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
