The 20-year-old winger lasted 33 minutes of his first start of the season against Birmingham City on Saturday; he absorbed a full-blooded sliding tackle from the defender Liam Ridgewell and, although the adrenaline in his body helped him to play on for a period, he was eventually forced off. Walcott underwent a scan yesterday and Wenger's fears of ligament damage, which he voiced after the game, were realised. Walcott did not travel to the Netherlands with the Arsenal squad for the Champions League tie against AZ Alkmaar tonight and, as well as the matches that he will miss at club level, which include the derby against Tottenham Hotspur at Emirates Stadium on 31 October, he becomes a serious doubt for England's friendly with Brazil in Doha on 18 November. After the Brazil game, England will play no more than three friendlies before next summer's World Cup finals. \"I believe Theo is worried about the World Cup, certainly, but I don't think there's any reason to worry now,\" Wenger said. \"He will be in the squad. It's October and he has an injury of two-three weeks. I say four to be covered. \"Theo is the type of player who controls the ball on the first touch,\" added the manager, who is also without Tomas Rosicky against Alkmaar; the midfielder has a slight knee problem. \"That is the biggest problem for strikers. When they are injured, will they continue to play like they did? Theo has had two shoulder surgeries that were from a genetic weakness [from his father] but, for the rest, I don't believe he is injury-prone.\" Wenger was asked whether he felt Ridgewell had set out to harm Walcott. \"Only the player knows,\" he said. \"I think the second part of the challenge did the damage. It is a double tackle. The first part is a very good tackle but the second leg was more dangerous. He cut through with his second leg. \"I don't want to believe that Walcott is targeted but I know how the game is in England. Eduardo got hit and injured on the first tackle [in the third minute against Birmingham in February 2008].\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
