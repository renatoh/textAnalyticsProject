Then they grow up and they reach for the money - but they never lose the hunger for applause. And that is why (along with the money) we find three old men still punching, still begging to be acclaimed as the best in the world. Five months before Joe Calzaghe had his first fight as a professional, beating a guy called Paul Hanlon in a bout way down the bill on a wet October night at the Cardiff Arms Park in 1993, Roy Jones Jr became a world champion for the first time. Fifteen years later, Calzaghe remains unbeaten and Jones rests uneasily on laurels tarnished by back-to-back chilling knockout defeats in 2004. Nevertheless, at New York's Madison Square Garden next month, after countless futile attempts to arrange the fixture over the past seven or eight years, Calzaghe finally gets to swap blows with Jones in a fight being promoted as a titanic struggle between two modern greats of the ring. Roy is 39, Joe is 36. From a boxing perspective, at least, there is something wrong with this picture. But boxing is business, and business is tough. This is a pension fight, no question. The reasons Jones has levered his way into this enviable financial position at such an advanced stage of his mostly glorious career are his reputation as the one-time best pound-for-pound fighter in boxing and a superficially impressive win over F\u00e9lix Trinidad (also a former pound-for-pound 'titlist') in the same house in January. Jones had the 35-year-old Trinidad down twice, yet too many times he betrayed his career-long reluctance to pull the trigger. In his prime, that instinct was born of dominance; he could do as he pleased, boxing his way home to an untroubled conclusion. Now, it is age that clogs his wheels - he just can't get the punches off any more. So, the attraction of the bout between Joe and Roy resides not so much in the prospect of a classic confrontation but in the anxiety over Jones's chin and reflexes, as well as Calzaghe's fragile fists. It is a contest reduced to a voyeuristic fascination with potential calamity rather than a celebration of skill. What is a shame is that it could all have been so different. Had Jones, Calzaghe and one other very good middleweight chosen or been allowed to engage in a serial rivalry, they could have matched the almost in-house competition of Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler, Thomas Hearns and Roberto Duran in the 1970s and 80s. Those truly great boxers ensured their lasting reputations by putting it on the line time and again. The third man in the pound-for-pound trilogy that never quite was is Bernard Hopkins. He is the man Jones beat to win the vacant IBF middleweight title in Washington DC, in May 1993, but who subsequently twisted and turned his way out of a rematch, upping the price like some Wall Street speculator. Except his stock slid. Hopkins, a supreme defensive tactician, couldn't sell umbrellas in Manchester. Admittedly, he did endure an enforced absence from the scene because of jail time and, through the power of his street rhetoric, he has reinvented himself marvellously. Hopkins's most recent outing was a points loss to Calzaghe in Las Vegas last April. He disputes the decision to the point of tedium, convinced he had the better of the Welshman, so he boxes on, determined to cement his place in the sport's hall of fame and not accepting that this third loss in five fights since July 2005 signals the end. If he is not careful, Calzaghe, too, is in danger of slipping into self-delusion. He must not only beat Jones in New York on 8 November, he must outbox him so convincingly he shores up his credentials to the point where there is no argument about his stature. And then walk away. When a fighter has done all there is to do in his career, invariably he tries to do it all over again, unable to let go. Joe wants to clinch his legacy. He needs another round of applause. Bernard, meanwhile, laughs off doubts about his age, 43, and, in Atlantic City next weekend, he boxes young Kelly Pavlik from Youngstown, Ohio, at 170lb, an agreement over weight to accommodate the fact that 26-year-old Pavlik is smaller than the old man by a good stone or so. The fact that Calzaghe should be testing himself against the unbeaten Pavlik rather than rounding out his career against a clearly shop-worn Jones is a given. But boxing is about the maths... and ego. In their own minds, Roy, Joe and Bernard are the best - of each other and the rest of boxing. As they see it, they are competing now, in the gloaming of their wonderful careers, for the right to be regarded as pound-for-pound the best fighter in the world. It is a view diminished not only by their combined age of 119, but the deeds of others. The best pound-for-pound fighter in boxing is, by most judgment, the little Filipino genius Manny Pacquiao. On 6 December, the 29-year-old moves up the weights to fight Oscar De La Hoya, another fine multi-weight champion who, at points in the past, also has been described as the pound-for-pound champion. Now he is in the pension business. De La Hoya is the front-of-house name of Golden Boy Promotions - co-promoters of Hopkins-Pavlik. Oscar is 35."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
