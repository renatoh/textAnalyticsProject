Recreational marijuana went on sale at 8am at two Massachusetts dispensaries, making the state the seventh in the nation to allow the sale of the drug. Alaska, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington all began sales in recent years. Massachusetts voters legalized cannabis in November 2016, but a cautious bureaucracy delayed sales until now. The rollout in the state is currently limited to two dispensaries: one in Northampton in western Massachusetts and one in the small town of Leicester in central Massachusetts. A number of other dispensaries across the state plan on opening, but it is unclear when state marijuana regulators will give them the green light. Customers in line at the Cultivate dispensary in Leicester on Monday were excited. \u201cThis is a monumental day in Massachusetts history,\u201d said Rich Sadowsky, 56, of nearby Sturbridge. \u201cI\u2019m on vacation, but I would have taken a vacation day for this.\u201d Andy Gordon, 72, drove 30 miles to the dispensary from his home in Leominster. He first smoked marijuana nearly five decades ago as a soldier in Vietnam and is happy that it is now legally available. \u201cIt sure did some wonders for our morale then and I hope it will do the same thing for me now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I lived long enough to see this day. I didn\u2019t think I would, but I did.\u201d Local police limited access in Leicester and warned hopeful customers of wait times. Buses shuttled customers to and from a remote parking site half a mile away, but many parked their vehicles wherever they could and made their way to the dispensary on foot. As groups of successful customers departed with their purchases, some left faint whiffs of marijuana smoke in their wake. Not everybody approached by the Guardian wanted to talk; marijuana remains illegal at the federal level and there is nothing to stop employers in Massachusetts from firing workers who use the drug without a medical prescription. While it is now completely legal in the state, a stigma remains and some still speak of it in whispers. But across the nation, attitudes on marijuana seem to be changing. The use, possession and growth of recreational marijuana is legal in neighbouring Vermont and nearby Maine. However, neither state permits the sale of the drug yet. It is similarly legal in the District of Columbia. And earlier this month, Michigan voted to legalise the drug. In Connecticut, the governor-elect, Ned Lamont, spoke in favor of the legalization of recreational marijuana during his campaign and on Monday said legalization would be one of the \u201cpriorities\u201d of the state\u2019s next legislative session. Jim Smith, a Boston attorney whose firm represents a number of cannabis companies in the state, hopes more stores will open soon. \u201cWith two stores east of the Mississippi, I think the rollout is going to be pretty chaotic,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo stores can\u2019t service the commonwealth of 6.7 million people. Denver has 200 stores servicing 670,000 people.\u201d At the New England Treatment Access dispensary in Northampton, more than 1,000 customers had been served through mid-afternoon according to Norton Arbelaez, the company\u2019s governmental affairs director. In line at the Leicester Cultivate dispensary, those waiting expressed hope that the legal sale of marijuana would have a positive impact on the state \u2013 and that it would soon be legal nationwide. Students Jack Merullo and Sam Tufts, both 21, drove to the dispensary from the Boston area early on Tuesday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal because our whole lives it\u2019s been a crime,\u201d said Merullo. As they were parking, they said a local cop directing the rush of people to the small town had recommended a strain they should try, saying he had a medical marijuana card. \u201cIt\u2019s empowering, it feels like we\u2019re finally getting the rights that we should have had,\u201d said Merullo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
