The moment Australian green and gold splashed on to the outfield for the inaugural Twenty20 international in England, the scent of an Ashes kill was unmistakable. First blood, because first blood it definitely was, went to England. It was not a Test match, it was not even a 50-overs international. In the great scheme of things it may well amount to diddly squat. But as an indication that England are bursting for the challenge ahead it was irrefutable. \"It was a bit of a lottery,\" said Michael Vaughan, England's captain. \"It means nothing.\" \"It was just a light-hearted, fun sort of game,\" agreed Ricky Ponting, his Australian opposite number. \"I don't think we'll spend weeks analysing it. We will just laugh it all off.\" But when the cream of Australian batting falls within 20 balls - list them and relish the moment: Gilchrist, Hayden, Symonds, Clarke, Hussey, Ponting and Martyn - then something remarkable is afoot. England's fielding was youthful and athletic, Australia were lackadaisical. Australia were not having fun. They were hurting. Nasser Hussain, who like many England captains has known pain against Australia, could not have put it more succinctly. As Ponting departed for a duck, Hussain said on Sky TV: \"You can sometimes go an entire day without taking four wickets against Australia. Now they've taken four in seven balls.\" Darren Gough, still relishing every minute of bowling fast for England, began Australia's collapse by dismissing Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden in successive balls, skiers safely pouched by his soulmate Kevin Pietersen, and was so energised that for his hat-trick ball, against Andrew Symonds, he fired in a bouncer. It is nonsense to suggest that anyone can make a case for Test selection in Twenty20 but Pietersen's buccaneering first encounter with Australia will again get him noticed. He was entirely nerveless, striking 34 from 18 balls, including a fierce straight drive against Michael Kasprowicz which seared Marcus Trescothick's helmet on the way to the boards. Jonathan Lewis's first ball in international cricket had been bludgeoned straight by Hayden - time to fear the worst. But Lewis finished with four wickets, dismissing Michael Clarke, who struggled on this ground for Hampshire, Symonds, the Twenty20 specialist, and Ponting for nought. Andrew Flintoff finished by pointedly bowling short at Australia's fast bowlers and struck Brett Lee on the helmet. England's 179 for eight was the highest Twenty20 score on this ground - a brief history perhaps but a fact nonetheless. It owed much to Paul Collingwood, whose 46 from 26 balls revived an innings that had stalled at 109 for five, against the slow bowlers. He fell to the last ball, caught at deep midwicket by Ponting. It is not often that an Australian captain finds himself fielding at deep midwicket but such is the frenetic pace of these games that anything is possible. What this England romp has done, as did last summer's Champions Trophy semi-final, is question Australian invincibility. They got behind the over rate and fielded ropily, cursed in part by a wickedly low sun. Geraint Jones will accept any sustenance as he tries to prove himself worthy of an opener's role and will value his cameo against Glenn McGrath and Lee. Trescothick, whose technique has been forensically unpicked in the past, played contentedly for 41 from 37 balls and may have eased a few bad memories. The captain Vaughan, like Ponting, made nought, chipping his first ball to mid-on. The traditional start to an Ashes summer had lasted only one over, time enough for Lee to rear the first ball past Trescothick's outside edge and fell Jones with a 94mph yorker. Was it imagination or was there a presumptuous smile or two? Duncan Fletcher, the England coach, had counselled before the match that big hitters such as Flintoff and Pietersen were needed for the last five overs. All it took was a promising flurry from Jones and Trescothick for Flintoff and Pietersen to be promoted up the order. Andrew Strauss, scheduled at No4, came in at No7. \"I'm not as much floating in the order as sinking,\" he said. The Rose Bowl was packed on a sun-drenched evening - a record 15,000 - and the atmosphere crackled. They could have filled Lord's twice over. Such is the public appetite for cricket on speed that a Twenty20 World Cup is inevitable, certainly within four years, perhaps sooner. There is no reason to delay. Australia are po-faced about Twenty20. John Buchanan, their coach, said: \"I don't think it needs to be overexposed. Its advantage is at club and county level to get kids involved.\" They are resisting an unstoppable tide. Twenty20 might entirely lack nuance but it possesses an instant appeal, as two county seasons have already testified. It will spread at international level because the public will demand it. In England, after last night, they will not be able to get enough of it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
