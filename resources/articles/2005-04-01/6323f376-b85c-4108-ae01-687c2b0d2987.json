Having known John Paul II and appreciated his charisma and kindness, I was sad to see him suffer but also sad to see him go. Now we have a new pope (Reports, April 20) and people are struggling to know quite what to say. Only Newsnight managed to touch the real issues when Cristina Odone described Joseph Ratzinger as \"fearsome\". I came across Ratzinger while we were making the Pope series in the Vatican and \"fearsome\" hardly covers it. The Catholic church has elected a man who is even more of a theological hardliner than the previous pontiff, the cardinal who ran the department that was previously the inquisition, and the man who more or less single-handedly destroyed liberation theology and thereby many of the hopes of the world's poor. He is not a \"humble worker in the vineyard of the Lord\" - this is a man who has all the makings of an autocrat but without any of the charisma or warmth of his predecessor. However, I heartily welcome the election of Pope Benedict XVI. He will almost certainly prove to be the most divisive pope for centuries and, with any luck, he will fatally damage the Catholic church. Richard Denton Altrincham, Cheshire Perhaps someone can explain how can a 78-year-old celibate man make informed judgments on matters such as contraception, condoms, sexuality and birth control? Roger Marsh Morecambe, Lancs Joseph Ratzinger has said we should resist relativism. I agree. But to acknowledge there is such a thing as truth is to admit the possibility that one may have to revise one's beliefs in the light of new evidence. Claims of infallibility are at odds with a respect for truth. Rebecca Linton Leicester Barbara McMahon's splendid inventory of titles assumed by Pope Benedict XVI omitted the most important one: servus servorum Dei - servant of the servants of God. John Bollan University of Glasgow Say what you like about the Catholic church, you can't accuse it of being ageist. Richard Redden West Wickham, Kent A million 35mm film canisters will not contain the tears of disappointment of those non-Roman, but catholic, Christians, who have been praying for so long for a more ecumenically minded pope.
