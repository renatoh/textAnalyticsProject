At first it looked like an audacious move to create a new \"super\" multimedia, multiplatform player for the burgeoning new media age. But when the excitement died down, it began to look more like two old drunks snuggling up on a park bench with only a couple of White Lightnings for comfort against a harsh winter's night. ITV and NTL have their problems, made all the more acute by the rapid pace of change in media markets. They urgently need to show progress towards solving them and both are the subject of repeated bid speculation. ITV is an old-media giant struggling with audience fragmentation, declining viewing figures and falling revenues. Its audience is still huge, but it is getting old. Finding a place in the hearts and minds of younger viewers is proving difficult. On the upside, ITV still has some fabulous programmes that can beat all comers. The company, although it has no chief executive, does have a strategy to try to improve its performance. Audiences are down year on year by 5%, but that is less than BBC1 and far less than the decline in Channel 4's audience over the same period. Cracker, Prime Suspect and Frost have all returned to big ratings and there are signs that late money entering the market is tending to go to ITV ahead of its competitors. On top of that, the multichannel strategy is paying off, with revenues from ITV2, 3 and 4 making up for a big part of ITV1's losses. So, in the short term, the ITV patient is showing more than a few signs of life. Looking to the long term, however, ITV still needs a forward-looking creative vision to guide the process of attracting younger, more upmarket viewers, finding a strategy for survival in the new media world and some new home-grown hits. But what about NTL? Cable should, by rights, have been a winner in the emerging new-media future. NTL and Telewest (now merged) had big, fat internet-capable \"pipes\" going into subscribers' homes, years before ADSL technology allowed similar functionality to be piped to nearly every home via the phone line. Interactivity and on-demand - the cable companies could do all this years before anyone else. But they didn't. Add to that its huge debts - on account of paying for the cable network itself - the legendary chronic customer service and its failure to invest in key content, and you can begin to see why it is in trouble. NTL is still dealing with the aftermath of its merger with Telewest and the purchase of Virgin Mobile, not to mention rebranding the whole group as Virgin Media. It likes to talk the language of \"quad play\" - phone, pay TV, mobile and internet in one package. But so far, consumers seem keener to shop around, taking the best from wherever they can find it, and this competition is rapidly reducing the value of delivery networks - witness the sprouting of \"free\" broadband offers. The only remedy for this affliction would appear to be killer content - which NTL doesn't have. So, while NTL might get excited at the thought of ITV's extensive programme library and the prospect of new \"killer\" content to populate its networks of cable and satellite channels, no one has yet explained how viewers might be persuaded to pay for it. And in any case, what help is any of this to ITV? Access to a ready-made subscriber base? Maybe, but NTL shed 37,000 of that base in the last quarter alone, and on-demand is threatening not just traditional broadcasters but those same subscriber bases. Cover from overweening City attention and persistent take-over speculation as part of a larger group? Again, maybe, but a combined entity with close to \u00a37bn of debt would attract lots of City attention. Size might bring some advantages in terms of talent, cross-promotion and the ability to bid for expensive content and, theoretically, a faster and more reliable delivery system than simple internet download. But even if these latter arguments were accepted in principle, it is not at all clear how NTL would actually manage it. And why would ITV - platform-neutral and increasingly focused on creating key content - want to be tied to one distribution company? In the meantime, ITV is leaderless, and if NTL's approach to ITV gains any traction at all - and it might if ITV shareholders were offered enough cash - other potential bidders will be flushed out, and in that context ITV might be without a CEO for some time yet. Time to snuggle up perhaps? Mine's a White Lightning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
