United travel to the Etihad Stadium 11 points behind City but Solskj\u00e6r is confident of his side\u2019s prospects. Wednesday\u2019s 2-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur followed victories over Chelsea and Leicester City plus a 1-1 draw with Liverpool. The manager was asked whether City should fear United in light of those results. \u201cWe might not want them to be scared of us, we might want them to be arrogant and confident because you don\u2019t have to shout the loudest to throw the sucker punch. It\u2019s not about shouting the loudest, it\u2019s about doing the talking on the pitch.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r was adamant that United, the record 20-times English champions, remain a bigger club than City, who have won four Premier League titles in the last seven years and last season claimed an unprecedented domestic treble. He also rejected the notion that United cannot compete with City, which his predecessor, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, has claimed. \u201cDon\u2019t agree,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are you going do? Are you going to give up? Not challenge them? That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to get back to. You can\u2019t argue that we\u2019re [not] too far behind but it\u2019s a chance for us now to challenge them and bridge that gap a little bit. So we\u2019re going there to win, we\u2019re going there to get a result, even though we know it\u2019s going to be difficult.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r stated how United can catch City and the leaders, Liverpool. \u201cWe keep on going in the direction we\u2019re going,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that we need to strengthen the squad in depth and in quality.\u201d He pointed to the summer recruitment of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Daniel James and Harry Maguire. \u201cWe\u2019ve signed three good \u2019uns, for sure. We\u2019ve got some young ones through but still the depth of the squad, especially when you think about all the injuries we\u2019ve had, we haven\u2019t been able to have that consistency. But when we get those [new] players in I\u2019m sure that gap is going to be closed.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r suggested there may not be any more Gal\u00e1ctico-style signings in the mould of Romelu Lukaku, Paul Pogba, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Radamel Falcao. \u201cDo I look like I\u2019m going to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on players we\u2019re not sure of? As I said, we need to rebuild, we need to change the culture. \u201cYou want the culture with that hunger and selflessness that most of these players are showing. You\u2019ve got the [Scott] McTominays and [Marcus] Rashfords and [Jesse] Lingards, the players that know what Man United is.\u201d Paul Pogba is not available but Anthony Martial has recovered from injury, the manager said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
