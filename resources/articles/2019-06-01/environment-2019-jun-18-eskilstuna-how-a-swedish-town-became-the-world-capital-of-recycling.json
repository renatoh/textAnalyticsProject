An hour\u2019s train ride from Stockholm, the \u201cSheffield of Sweden\u201d has had something of an image problem in recent years. Once a steel-producing powerhouse, the town has fallen on hard times, thanks to the rapid decline in the industry throughout the 1970s. It now has an unemployment rate that is almost double the national average of 8%. But the town has come up with an answer: recycling. Far from the Scandinavian stereotype of glossy modernity, Eskilstuna\u2019s wide-paved, near-deserted grey streets are populated by kitsch 1980s pizzerias, workers\u2019 cafes and gloomy pubs \u2013 not a place where you would expect to find such a radical approach to the environment. Yet since 2012, Eskilstuna has implemented a spate of green initiatives, vying to make it the most environmentally friendly city in Sweden \u2013 and perhaps the world. Public buses and cars are run on biogas and electricity, and the town uses low-carbon combined heat and power plants, which use the thermal energy from electricity production to heat water. Residents sort their waste into seven multicoloured categories at home \u2013 green for food, pink for textiles, grey for metal, yellow for paper, blue for newspaper, orange for plastic and black for mixed \u2013 and for the past four years people have been able to drop off their unwanted goods for recycling at Bergstr\u00f6m\u2019s secondhand mall. Bergstr\u00f6m moved to Eskilstuna in 2012, after becoming disillusioned with the huge waste she encountered during her career in commercial fashion, to run ReTuna (Tuna is the town\u2019s nickname). She says the idea startled people to begin with. \u201cWhen I first came here, no one knew about the mall. And when they did, no one liked it,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a town like this, which has suffered, people are suspicious of change, especially something as radical as a shopping mall where all the goods are donated by the people of the town and then resold to them.\u201d Yet, since the recycling scheme began and ReTuna opened it has been a success, resulting in no domestic waste going to landfill, and potentially providing a second lease of life for the steel city. Despite being a 20-minute drive from the town centre on a Wednesday morning, ReTuna is full of shoppers roaming through secondhand stores, looking at everything from furniture to children\u2019s toys, flowers and clothes. The mall is situated in an unassuming warehouse building in the middle of a field, next to one of the town\u2019s two recycling centres. Residents drop off their goods to be sorted by the 12 staff on hand in the cavernous warehouse beneath the shop floors. Standing in ReTuna\u2019s entrance hall beneath a tree fashioned from recycled cups, Bergstr\u00f6m explains how she won over the town. \u201cEveryone\u2019s minds began to change the day we opened,\u201d she says. \u201cSix thousand people came to visit that day, and since then we average 700 visitors a day and 300 tour groups a year.\u201d The daily tour groups \u2013 which are made up mainly of students \u2013 shows how innovative Eskilstuna\u2019s recycling schemes are. Today\u2019s tour, for instance, is part of an exchange between Indian students from a college in Pune and a local Swedish media school. The teacher from Pune, Sonia Khambete, organised the trip after she heard about ReTuna on social media. \u201cThis is a very inspiring place,\u201d she says. \u201cIn India, we have a huge waste management problem where, as the population grows, we increasingly live in a throwaway culture. We brought our students here because we could all learn a lot from a place like ReTuna.\u201d Mother-and-daughter shoppers Sandra and Elisabeth Jarvinen agree. \u201cWe have lived in Eskilstuna our whole lives,\u201d Sandra says, \u201cand ReTuna has revitalised the town, it\u2019s something for us to be proud of.\u201d Bjorn Gutenberg, who lives 30 miles (50km) outside ReTuna, but comes to shop here at least once a week, says: \u201cWe\u2019re actually addressing the problem. It creates job opportunities, and it\u2019s great for people to see the whole chain of recycling and consumption.\u201d Shoppers come from even further afield, too, says Bergstr\u00f6m who adds that families have visited from France, Japan and even Australia. ReTuna is owned by Eskilstuna\u2019s energy board, which is run by the city municipality, the Swedish version of a local council. To get the project started, the municipality invested 19.5m Swedish kronor (\u00a31.6m) for building works, but also to subsidise rates for the shop owners. In 2018, for the first time, the mall operated without this subsidy and it broke even, but Bergstr\u00f6m knows revenues need to increase to keep the business running. \u201cWe need to make more money to be able to hire people because the shop owners work really hard seven days a week.\u201d One such shop owner is Maria Larsson, who works a 70-hour week to keep her florist open. Alongside preowned items, she sells upcycled pieces, too. \u201cI\u2019ve invested all my money into this shop, and I\u2019m hoping this is the first year I\u2019ll actually get paid,\u201d she says. \u201cI have had to put all the money [it has made] back into the business, and have pretty much been surviving on my fiance\u2019s wages. This mall would maybe work better in a town with more people and more employment.\u201d Larsson, like the other shop owners, has to address the problem of how to price products they have received for nothing \u2013 while still making a profit and paying the costs of running their shops. \u201cPeople assume our products should be cheap, but it\u2019s really hard to price what we do,\u201d she says. \u201cEskilstuna is a workers\u2019 town, so people here are suspicious; they care about functionality over sustainability.\u201d A rummage through the mall finds shirts retailing for 120 kronor, books for 60 kronor and Larsson\u2019s flower pots for 480 kronor. For the workers in the sorting plant, it is an equally demanding job. Matti Koskela, 25, works 10-hour shifts, hauling waste from cars into the ReTuna warehouse. \u201cEverything people bring along is very good,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve shopped in the mall once before, and thought it was great. We all work very hard because people around here don\u2019t have much money. But it\u2019s a lot better than my last job in an incineration plant. I just hope the mall will last.\u201d More than 10% of Eskilstuna\u2019s population of 100,000 is made up of refugees (about 239,000 people sought asylum in the country between 2015 and 2018, according to the government) and the shopping mall provides opportunities for them to acquire skills, or brush them up. Yusuf al-Aboud from Syria has lived in Sweden for two years and works as a handyman in the ReTuna furniture store. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked making things, doing work with my hands, so this job has been great to help with the environment as well as produce nice products,\u201d he says, smiling, while painting a repurposed dresser. \u201cBack home, we would never throw things away unless they are completely broken, so this work is usual for me.\u201d His residency permit has not been renewed for next year, though, and so he will soon be forced to move on. \u201cThey want me to enrol in university or get some more education, but I already have all the skills I need,\u201d he says. \u201cI wish they would let me keep on working.\u201d Another recent arrival to Eskilstuna is a Glaswegian, Kevin Roxburgh. Having lived in Stockholm for 30 years, Roxburgh moved to Eskilstuna two weeks ago to manage ReTuna\u2019s franchise of the charity shop chain, Stadsmissionen. \u201cI used to work in fashion, like Anna,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I became totally disillusioned with all the waste \u2013 I decided I wanted to help people in their lives instead.\u201d Stadsmissionen employs staff with learning difficulties and long-term unemployed people. It was founded in Roxburgh\u2019s home town, under the name Glasgow City Mission. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised by the mall,\u201d he says, \u201cand I think this recycling system is brilliant \u2013 it\u2019s much better than Stockholm\u2019s and definitely better than the UK\u2019s.\u201d Roxburgh recently gained Swedish citizenship, because of \u201call this Brexit bullshit\u201d, and says he has no plans to move back. \u201cThis is the real community spirit here,\u201d he adds. Any waste, or \u201cresources\u201d, that cannot be resold in ReTuna, finds its way to the Lilla Nyby sorting centre a 20-minute drive away. From the outside, Lilla Nyby is a typical waste plant: heaps of putrid rubbish waiting to be sorted, opportunistic gulls swooping and diggers carving through the mounds. There is a noticeable lack of people at Lilla Nyby, though. Inside the warehouse, the recycling bags whirr through a maze of conveyor belts, passing camera points which recognise their different colours and then swat them off the line accordingly. The result is a seamless trash-maze that allows five people to process 20,000 tonnes of waste a year. Standing beneath the energy board\u2019s logo, which looks like a floating carrot, the manager, Mattias Hellstr\u00f6m, explains how it takes the effort out of recycling: \u201cThe machine is perfect because people are lazy,\u201d he says. Hellstr\u00f6m joined the team 10 years ago, when the plant was being built alongside the covered remains of the town\u2019s landfill. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this whole place change in that time,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore, if you wanted to recycle any waste, you would have to drive it to the bins by the supermarket. With this new system, people seem much more engaged with the environment because it is so easy \u2013 we have more than 97% accuracy in the sorting of waste in the bags.\u201d Although sometimes something unusual turns up: \u201cWe found a dead puppy in one of the blue bags two years ago.\u201d As well as simply sorting the waste, food waste is composted at Lilla Nyby and sold back to residents. \u201cIt\u2019s so high-quality, it sells out,\u201d Hellstr\u00f6m says \u2013 and the biogas from food waste at the plant is used for the city\u2019s buses. In a small, humid shed behind the warehouse, an Uppsala University research project is taking place. They are testing the use of maggot larvae to digest food waste, then using the fattened maggots to feed to livestock, and potentially even humans. The worm has turned. Sorting your household rubbish into seven different categories may sound like a step too far, yet the residents of Eskilstuna, it seems, have become waste aficionados. This might be because to opt out of the multicoloured scheme means doubling the yearly household waste disposal fee of 2,894 kronor. Yet, for new parents Caroline and Marlin Sommerlid, the recycling scheme is a moral obligation. \u201cWe\u2019re very proud citizens to have this scheme here,\u201d Caroline says, her five-week-old baby resting on her shoulder. \u201cI want my children to grow up in a world that hasn\u2019t been destroyed, and for them to leave it in better shape than they got it in.\u201d We meet in their newly built, eco-friendly house situated in the leafy suburbs of Eskilstuna. \u201cI built this house to fit in with our recycling systems,\u201d construction engineer Marlin says, showing the integrated bins nestled beneath the sink. \u201cCaroline is obsessed \u2013 I came from a place where people didn\u2019t recycle, but her parents were militant.\u201d \u201cWhen I go to places without the sorting systems, I feel as if I\u2019m back in the 80s,\u201d Caroline says. If the scheme is so successful, why hasn\u2019t it been introduced to other municipalities in Sweden, or even to other countries? \u201cThese projects require a lot of land to operate on,\u201d the municipality\u2019s director of energy, Kristina Birath, explains. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason it couldn\u2019t be implemented throughout Sweden though. We just need more bold politicians with a vision to be green.\u201d This may be increasingly difficult with Sweden recently experiencing the resurgence in far-right politics seemingly sweeping throughout Europe. Jimmie \u00c5kesson, leader of the Sweden Democrats, who won 17% of votes in the 2018 elections, has said that Greta Thunberg\u2019s protest against the climate crisis is a \u201cstaged promotional campaign\u201d. Yet Birath is optimistic: \u201cFrom next year, all Swedish municipalities will be legally required to recycle. We have had rightwing governments before, so we\u2019re used to being brave.\u201d The Social Democrat leader of the municipality, Jimmy Jansson, says other Swedish towns are slow to catch up because of a \u201clack of knowledge\u201d. Born and raised in the town, Jansson left school at the height of its deindustrialisation. \u201cWe lost 10,000 inhabitants, and we\u2019re still recovering from that time,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to find a new identity, and it felt natural to tackle the question of being a dirty industrial town. We had an opportunity to learn from our past mistakes and, even though we have not entirely recovered, it\u2019s not difficult to do the right thing \u2013 it\u2019s our responsibility.\u201d With continued high unemployment, these environmental policies could appear nothing more than a cynical rebrand for a town which, in Jansson\u2019s words, \u201cnobody wanted to come to\u201d. Yet, Birath says, while the new recycling scheme has created 50 new jobs \u2013 a small dent in the almost 15,000 unemployed \u2013 for residents, the radical green action has not just put Eskilstuna back on the map. It has done so in a way that makes them proud. \u201cIt has been a long time coming,\u201d Bergstr\u00f6m says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get a town on board that has been so scarred by change in the past \u2013 so if we can make a success of it here, it could happen anywhere in the world. Where there is waste, there is an opportunity.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 20 June 2019. The original stated that 780,000 people had sought asylum in Sweden since 2015.
