Residents in the village of Woodsetts, in South Yorkshire, said the plans by Ineos to carry out test drilling would \u201cruin so many people\u2019s lives\u201d and \u201cdevastate\u201d the local community. Councillors in Rotherham have twice refused planning permission for Ineos to carry out test drilling on the green belt land, citing concerns about highway safety and a lack of information about any environmental impacts. But on Tuesday the multinational firm argued for those decisions to be overturned as a planning inquiry got under way in Rotherham. Amid demonstrations from dozens of local residents, Gordon Steele QC, representing Ineos, told the planning inquiry that concerns about fracking were \u201csimply not relevant\u201d to the application. Steele said Ineos was only seeking permission at this stage to drill an exploratory core well for a \u201cvery limited timescale\u201d. \u201cThis does not include fracking,\u201d he told the planning inspector Katie Peerless. \u201cAccordingly, any objections which are based on a concern about, or opposition to, fracking are simply not relevant at this inquiry.\u201d The tiny village of Woodsetts, home to just 1,700 people, is the latest frontline in the shale gas industry\u2019s faltering attempts to make a success of fracking in Britain. Councillors have raised concerns that the proposed drilling site is next to a sheltered housing development for the elderly and seriously ill, including residents with dementia, epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder. Three weeks ago Ineos submitted an application to build a 270-metre-long, three-metre high fence as an \u201cacoustic sound barrier\u201d to shield the Berne Square estate \u2013 an idea met with incredulity by residents who called it \u201cthe Great Wall of Ineos\u201d. Helen Clarke, who lives on Berne Square, said she suffered from sleep apnoea and breathing difficulties caused by stress and noise, and worried that the proposed development would seriously affect her health. \u201cWe don\u2019t ask for much, just peace and quiet. This will all be lost, maybe for ever if drilling goes ahead,\u201d she told the inquiry. \u201cPlease put people first for once, not profit. I cannot express strongly enough how worried I am about this plan. It is my human right to enjoy peace and quiet and fresh air. Please do not let them build on it.\u201d Residents of Woodsetts have crowdfunded \u00a310,000 to pay a lawyer to help them fight the application by Ineos, which is owned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the UK\u2019s richest person. Jack Parker, barrister for Woodsetts Against Fracking, told the inquiry that the proposal would have an \u201cunacceptable impact\u201d on the residents of the sheltered housing estate. \u201cIt just makes a joke of local democracy,\u201d said Shontelle Gavins, another resident. \u201cWe voted twice, we\u2019ve beaten them twice, and because they didn\u2019t get the result that they wanted, they took it to government, so there is no democracy. It\u2019s just a really, really sad day.\u201d Dawn Norman, 71, who lives across the road from the proposed drilling site, said she suffers from serious lung and heart conditions and was worried about the impact on her health. \u201cWe live in a beautiful spot. The eyesore, the noise, we\u2019re not going to be able to get in and out of our gateway for the lorries. The mud, the diesel emissions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to ruin so many people\u2019s lives. All the wildlife will be destroyed. I could go on for ever, there\u2019s so many things. We\u2019ve got a beautiful community and such a delightful little village and it\u2019s just going to totally devastate it.\u201d Steele said Rotherham borough council officials had not objected to the application on the grounds of traffic or greenbelt issues. The planning inspector is expected to announce a decision on the appeal following the eight-day inquiry. Linda Sharpley, who has lived in the village for five years, told the inquiry she had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d that the drilling would \u201cdominate every aspect of life\u201d and damage the wellbeing of residents across the region. \u201cHaving grown up in a mining village I know the drawbacks of living near an industrial site,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes its toll on the lives and health of people nearby. But we should now know better than this. Industrialisation of villages does not leave them in a better state.\u201d Nigel Butler, 60, who has lived in Woodsetts for 26 years, told the inquiry that the proposed site was \u201cas inappropriate a site as it\u2019s possible to get\u201d. \u201cResidents voted 1,000 to one to reject this; Woodsetts parishcouncil rejected it; RMBC [Rotherham Metropolitan borough council] rejected it; RMBC rejected it again. Our MP, Kevin Barron, is opposed it,\u201d he said. \u201cLocal people, elected or otherwise, know their local area. Listen to them\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
