Or as the New Zealanders, who pronouce a's as e's and e's as i's - and so on - might say, 'thet's en ewful lut uf kibeb'. This of course sounds better than the American version - kebob. The preponderence of kebabs is particularly apparent on Queen Street, Auckland's main shopping street, where I came across a kebab vendor approximately every 100m, making it almost as good as south Manchester for choice and variety - though as one New Zealander said to me, \"There ain't no foot and mouth on us\". And whereas in Manchester most of the kebab houses are run by Indians and Pakistanis, in Auckland they were mainly Turkish. On night one I plumped for The Sultan's Table, an upmarket sit-down kebab restaurant on Victoria Street West. I had a mixed meze starter, followed by an Iskender kebab, washed down with a couple of bottles of New Zealand wine. It was a good start to this leg of the journey. By my third night in Auckland however, it was back to the late night grease of the takeaway kebab joint. I chose Kebabs on Queen for the simple reason that it was nearest to where I was staying. There I was served New Zealand lamb (halal) on Lebanese bread in a Turkish kebab shop topped with humous and salad. The proliferation of the kebab in New Zealand didn't happen, of course, until mass immigration began. Nowadays over 80% of the population is of European or Asian ethnicity. It's pretty safe to say that the Maori culture did not have a kebab as such. Maori cooking was much more likely to have been done in an earth oven in the ground than on a skewer. This is demonstrated to hundreds of tourists every night at an organised Hangi in a mock Maori village outside Rotorua. The evening starts with the tourists pretending their bus is a Maori canoe. \"Those sitting in the aisle, I want you to pretend you have a paddle\" said the driver/cox. The tourists then have a display of Maori singing and dancing before gorging themselves on the food cooked in the ground. \"Thankyou for taking an interest in our culture\" said the guide. \"Thankyou for some great food\" said Tim, the spokesman for our bus. In Rotorua the thermal activity was in full flow. Outside town the boiling mud pools were doing what boiling mud pools do best: bubbling and spitting and giving out a foul smell. Dotted around the area were steaming fields and erupting geysers. The Lady Knox geyser, with the help of a bag of soap poured down the hole to relieve the surface tension, erupts every day at 10.15am, drawing quite a crowd to see it shoot it's load. It was, as we say in east London, a diamond geyser. At the Polynesian Spa I soaked in the thermal pools overlooking Lake Rotorua, letting the sulphur work its magic. After soaking for an hour I was ready for my treatment, a honey and lavender rehydration and polishing package. Affecting concern for my modesty in spite of the fact that I was naked except for a disposable paper g-string, the beauty therapist asked \"shall I do your tummy and breasts too?\" And with absolutely all my body rehydrated and polished, it was on to the body massage. I don't know whether it was the ylang ylang, the lavender, the sandalwood or the orange oil, but whatever it was, this was the best massage I have ever had. And when you're feeling thoroughly relaxed, with all the cares of the world massaged away, what better way to prepare for the stress or everyday life by being put in the driving seat of a small Cessna 150 two-seater plane and told to fly it? Tahlia, my instructor at Kaikoura Air Field, was only 22, but she'd been flying since she was 16. She gave me a quick lesson on the ground with a diagram of the cockpit and a toy plane. With the words thrust, drag and elevation going round in my head, it was on to the runway. \"You're going to take off\" said Tahlia, and though my main interest was in flying the plane rather than taking off and landing, that gives rise to some suspicion these days, so I did as I was told. \"Do I need to be able to drive a car?\" I had asked Tahlia on the phone. I do drive, but for the last six years have only ever driven an automatic. Luckily, the plane only had two pedals so it wasn't that different. We flew around the peninsula for half an hour with me turning left and right and ducking and diving and then brought the plane into land. It was, as the New Zealanders say, sweet as."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
