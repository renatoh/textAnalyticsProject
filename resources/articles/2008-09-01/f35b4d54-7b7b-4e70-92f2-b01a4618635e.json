Affable, urbane chap who did not mince his words but occasionally made a rag\u00f9 of them? The Italian was in charge of Chelsea the last time mega-money arrived in the Premier League, when the whole world appeared to be talking about the depth of Roman Abramovich's pockets and who might be next on the Stamford Bridge shopping list. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, was the short answer to that question, though not before Ranieri had agreed, in his inimitable way, that money can at least buy you attention. 'Even under the sea they are talking about Chelsea,' he remarked, weirdly, before accepting the inevitable and going off to sleep with the fishes. Manchester City are in almost exactly the same position, with Mark Hughes feeling his management skills might be on trial all over again and Robinho making a debut against the club who spent all summer tracking him. Yet it might be a while before Eastlands gets the hang of being the centre of the world's attention, aquatic or otherwise. City, typically, picked a bad day to present themselves as the next big thing. Not only were they upstaged earlier in the day by their neighbours, when Manchester United contrived to lose to Liverpool for the first time in the Rafa Ben\u00edtez era, but they were also up against more far-fetched events in the Newcastle soap opera and Derby's attempts to avoid going a year without winning a league game. Judging by their chants of 'Champions League, you're havin' a laugh', the travelling Chelsea supporters can be counted among those who doubt that the addition of a skilful though essentially lightweight Brazilian such as Robinho can lift City into the elite, though this popularly held scepticism can be countered by the recognition that Hughes has also added J\u00f4, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta and Tal Ben-Haim to what was quite a decent team. What is at issue is whether City can change their DNA, to stop being, well, a bit of a joke. Even fans were slightly disconcerted a couple of weeks ago, when no sooner had the club's new owners completed the stealthiest of takeovers than they began bragging naively about signing Cristiano Ronaldo and putting together the best team on the planet. Right in their moment of celebration, City supporters felt, the club had reverted to type as a laughing stock. Sir Alex Ferguson took the opportunity to dismiss City as 'all talk' and, in the hiatus between the closing of the transfer window and the resumption of domestic games after the international break, it was impossible for anyone from the blue half of Manchester to argue. So this first home game since the takeover was supposed to make a statement, and it did. It said 'Same Old City' very clearly, which was not the message the Eastlands faithful wanted to hear. After politely ignoring that everything Robinho touched turned to dust in the first 10 minutes, the stadium came to vibrant life when their new record signing supplied a dream opening goal, whipping a free-kick past the stationary Petr Cech from the edge of the area. While it was the most favourably starred of starts, the new City did exactly what the old City would have done and conceded within four minutes. 'If we could have stayed in front for just 10 or 15 minutes it would have helped,' Hughes lamented. Worse than that, after Ricardo Carvalho had crashed in from Lampard's corner at the second attempt, City defended so poorly that only Chelsea's profligate finishing spared them from turning round a goal or two down. Florent Malouda headed against the bar when completely unchallenged in front of goal and put a second opportunity just wide. Right on the stroke of the interval, City were grateful for a reprieve from the normally reliable Nicolas Anelka, when more comedy defending had left their former striker looking at an open goal. There was a brief but significant cameo at the start of the second half when Robinho completed four step-overs then passed straight to Ashley Cole, before Chelsea took full advantage of Manchester United's midday lapse. Catching City over-extended in attack and driving through the middle in a textbook counter, Frank Lampard accepted a return pass from Malouda and finished decisively to complete a highly satisfactory week. It would have been better still had Anelka added a third from an inspired Lampard pass a few moments later, but you can't have everything. Anelka scored anyway, 20 minutes from time. What you can have, as the Manchester United manager has just been reminding everybody, is all the money in the world but not the best team. This message was powerfully reinforced just after an hour when Carvalho came from nowhere to make a quite stunning block that prevented Stephen Ireland levelling the scores. These are still early days for City; the best you could say is that they are a work in progress and looked it. Chelsea are the finished article and they looked it too. This was probably their best performance of the season, just when they needed it to be. City did not play badly and look certain to be both improved and entertaining this season, but this was a result to put top-four talk into perspective. It ain't easy. City have lost two of their first four games. Unless the wheels fall off at Liverpool, Arsenal or even United in the coming months, they could already have left it too late. 'I am very happy with my players. I have a fantastic team,' Scolari confirmed. 'I wished Robinho all the best too. I like him, he is my friend. I didn't even mind him scoring against us once we had scored three.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
