Starting with David Blunkett in 1997, almost every education minister has expressed enthusiasm for out-of-classroom learning, but this is the first time the government has set out exactly why it thinks these learning experiences are valuable. \"This is a significant step,\" says Stephen Brown, who chairs the national panel representing local authority outdoor education advisers. \"We have known the value of these experiences for many years, but, finally, the government has made the case.\" But, as he listens to Johnson this morning, Brown may wonder how serious the government is about the project. There are questions about priorities and funding, and some of those the government is relying upon to deliver the manifesto are facing a very uncertain future. According to the Association of Head s of Outdoor Education Centres (Ahoec), a significant number of centres are under threat of closure or review. \"At the moment, 22 centres are facing cuts in provision, cuts in budgets, or proposals to close,\" says Kevin Jackson, Ahoec's chair. \"We welcome the manifesto and strongly support the principles behind outdoor learning, but we will need the specialist skills of the staff in these centres.\" The manifesto takes the form of a series of pledges, with local authorities and education organisations being invited to sign up as evidence of their commitment. There's the promise of a residential experience for every state-school pupil, alongside a programme to promote and support out-of-classroom learning. Many of the things lobbyists have been asking for are there, including a statement about the value of experiential learning, and programmes of personal and social development. Yet there is no commitment to funding. No clear programme of action. Pre-manifesto briefings suggested that there would be a few millions of seed-corn funding, mainly for additional teacher training and new guidance sources for teachers. No cash on the table \"I don't see much cash on the table,\" says Karen Brush, chief executive of the Institute for Outdoor Learning. \"Over a quarter of young people live below the poverty line. Financial support is vital if those young people are to benefit.\" Other doubts centre on schools' capacity and willingness to deliver their side of the deal. In the state sector, around 60% of pupils are offered the opportunity of a residential trip during their school career, usually paid for by their parents. But few state schools place out-of-classroom learning at the heart of their curriculum, and only a tiny number make it compulsory. In the independent sector e xtra-curricular activities have long been a strong suit. Bromsgrove school in Warwickshire, where annual fees are over \u00a320,000, is typical. First-year pupils follow a programme that includes a trek on the Malvern hills, plus a weekly Wednesday afternoon schedule of activities, including campcraft, climbing, public speaking, orienteering and cooking. The year culminates in a compulsory summer camp in Wales. Older children join the school's cadet force, or take the Duke of Edinburgh's award. The school also runs more expensive activities, but the headteacher, Chris Edwards, believes that most of what Bromsgrove offers as a core entitlement could be replicated in state schools. And he is evangelical about the benefits. \"You can clutch with glee all the A-levels you want at 18, but if that is all a school has given you, it has surely failed,\" he says. In contrast, Stephen Brown estimates that fewer than 10% of state schools currently have a residential trip as an entitlement for all their pupils. \"That's down to cost, commitment, and the mistaken fear that something might go wrong,\" he says. One school that does run a comprehensive programme is the Macmillan Academy in Middlesbrough. Last week, pupils from Macmillan's year 7 were visiting an Outward Bound centre as part of a rolling schedule that sees almost every pupil take part. \"Learning outside the classroom has always been central to what we do here,\" says the academy's principal, Ken Fraser. \"We provide the wherewithal for students whose families would struggle with the cost. This is a very successful school with 93% GCSE A-Cs this year, and some of the best value-added figures in the country. I believe our outdoor education programme contributes to those standards.\" Macmillan's outdoor education programme is grant aided by the Outward Bound Trust. \"We spent \u00a31.4m last year on bursaries and grants,\" says Nick Barrett, Outward Bound's chief executive, \"and we welcome the manifesto.\" But radical change will be necessary if the vast majority of schools are to be able to fulfil today's manifesto pledges. Building teacher confidence will be an essential first step. Stephen Brown recently met some newly qualified teachers who had no experience of out-of-classroom learning. \"Work must be done in initial teacher training, and that needs to start quickly,\" he says. Some of that training could be delivered by experienced teachers in local authority outdoor education centres. But 20 of these have closed in the last 10 years, and there are more closures to come. In Bournemouth, the local authority plans to close the successful Hengistbury Head Outdoor Education Centre, which currently takes 12,000 students a year. Teachers will be replaced by wardens, who will have to manage the local headland and provide interpretation and support for groups. \"The quantity and quality of the provision will change,\" says a Bournemouth teacher, who asked not to be named. \"It may end up with self-led groups following trails around the headland. The hands-on, quality learning experiences will be lost.\" Closures no surprise Apparently, DfES senior officials were horrified when told of the reviews and closures. But it should not have come as a surprise. Since 1992, government policy has been to transfer education funding from local authorities to schools. Most local authorities stopped subsidising outdoor education centres years ago. The few that continue find it increasingly difficult. \"Our current subsidy is \u00a3746,000,\" says Adrian Hardman, education cabinet member for Worcestershire county council, where all three centres are currently under review. \"Our Malvern centre needs \u00a31.7m of investment and our Llanrug centre was only used by 1,000 Worcestershire children last year. It is well used by other schools, but why should Worcestershire council tax payers subsidise schools from other authorities?\" he says. One answer might be to subsidise pupils rather than centres, as Outward Bound does with its bursaries programme. Teachers are also looking for changes in the curriculum, and an inspection regime less focused on test results. \"I value out-of-classroom learning,\" one headteacher said. \"But in a recent inspection I was firmly told to concentrate on the core curriculum.\" The manifesto highlights the \"strong evidence\" for the educational impact of learning outside the classroom. And Freedom's Orphans, a recent report by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), underlines the importance of the approach. \"Better-off children are much more likely to attend constructive, organised or educational activities, which are associated with greater personal and social development, while poorer children are more likely to spend time 'hanging out' with friends or watching TV - activities associated with poorer personal and social development.\" The IPPR's answers to these problems were complex, but part of the solution lay in structured activities outside the classroom; which is precisely what Alan Johnson will propose today. The question is: can he deliver?
