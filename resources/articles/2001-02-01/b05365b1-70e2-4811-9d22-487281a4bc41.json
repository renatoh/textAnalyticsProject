Shipping money off the pitch, the club is having no fortune on it either. Gerry Francis's dejection after a late Bolton equaliser cost his side two crucial points in their fight against relegation was not helped by the prospect of persuading a benefactor to buy into the club after the chairman Chris Wright announced he was stepping down. Wright said last week he was spending around \u00a330,000 a game to fund the club's losses while the returns on his \u00a320m investment over more than four years have been negligible. He decided to quit after three fans tried to attack him after the defeat by Fulham last Wednesday. As an advertisement for a replacement it is hardly inviting. Wright will continue to bankroll the club to ensure it survives until a buyer is found but Francis, whose own future has been put in doubt, admitted on Saturday that potential investors are not queuing up. \"To get the club going forward again it's going to need an investment of around \u00a330m to \u00a340m,\" the manager said. \"At the moment expenditure levels outweigh the income and only one man is covering that. There are not too many people lining up to take that position over. \"Chris needs help and, if someone can come in and put in money, that's the future. If he sells the club, there's a good chance the new owners will bring in their own backroom staff, but my position is irrelevant. It's the long-term future of QPR that's important.\" Francis's 2-year contract runs out in the summer and, according to Iain Dowie, QPR's coach who came on as a substitute striker on Saturday, the strain of a spate of injuries and being second bottom is beginning to show on the manager. \"This year's been very tough and the pressure takes its toll on him,\" Dowie said. \"He's a great coach, though, and given the right kind of finances he could have taken this club massively forward.\" It now seems unlikely that Francis will ever get the chance or the financial means to try to make QPR the top team in London again, as he did in 1993 during his first spell as manager. Come May, he will settle for fourth bottom of the First Division. Bolton's prospects are much brighter. Sam Allardyce felt that Per Frandsen's 86th-minute equaliser, after his side had been reduced to 10 men in the first half following the goalkeeper Steve Banks' sending off for a handball outside the area, could be a crucial goal in their attempt to return to the Premiership. \"It's a massive turning point in our season and greater than some of the wins we have achieved,\" Allardyce said. \"It shows great resilience from the players.\" Michel Ngonge had earlier scored his first goal for QPR with a looping header and the home side had enough chances to see off their depleted opposition. But goals, like money, are hard to come by at the moment. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
