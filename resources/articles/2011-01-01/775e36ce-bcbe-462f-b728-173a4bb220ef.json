He thinks it's no job for a girl and wants her to get married. So when Lila's friend, Chulak, thinks that he has successfully wrested the secret of being a firework-maker from Lila's father, and tells her that she must travel to the grotto of the fire fiend at the top of the volcano and get him to give her a secret ingredient, Lila runs away to fulfil her dream. But what if Chulak's information is unreliable, and Lila is running towards certain death? Like Lila herself, whose first firework is a bit of a damp squib, it took Told By an Idiot two attempts to really make Philip Pullman's wonderful novella spark. While Birmingham Stage Company don't exactly put on an explosive theatrical display, there's plenty to enjoy in this tale about children who must learn maturity, and parents who must learn to trust their children. Phil Clark's production finds an ingenious way to stage the final firework competition that fits in well with the overall \"poor theatre\" approach. Jackie Trousdale's neat design is always imaginative, offering sheets that double as mountains, some exquisitely simple basketwork-style animal heads, and a tiny puppet figure representing Lila as she makes her way up the side of the volcano. The acting doesn't always quite match the visuals. The river pirates are a little too broad, nudging the story towards pantomime, and there's something over-emphatic about the way adult actors play children. But there's some lovely singing, and the deliberate raggedness of the production leave enough gaps to allow young audiences to use their own imaginations in this story of courage and about the importance of believing in yourself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
