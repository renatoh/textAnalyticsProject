Mr Campbell left Downing Street clutching the scalps of the former BBC director general, Greg Dyke, and the chairman, Gavyn Davies, and David Hill has emerged from the clouds of controversy blown up by the Hutton report as the government's new communications chief. Mr Hill (number 44 in the list), who oversaw the Labour party's communications strategy for the 1997 general election, returned to the Labour fold after a stint at Lord Bell's Good Relations PR. Briefed to take some of the spin out the government's PR machine and adopt a far lower profile, Mr Hill will play a crucial role in the battle to regain the trust of the electorate in the run-up to the next general election. Sir Martin Sorrell (number nine in the top 100) takes the top spot in the marketing and PR league of influence, however. WPP is home to a legion of PR firms, marketing consultancies and research businesses. It owns 25 PR businesses, such as Hill &amp; Knowlton, Burson Marsteller and Chime Communications, and a number of specialist companies, including the Henley Centre and Millward Brown, which oil the wheels of the communications business. Niall FitzGerald will only be chairman of household brands giant Unilever for another two months before becoming chairman of Reuters. In either job he would have earned a place in this year's MediaGuardian 100. He joins the global news and information agency when the company finally appears to be turning the corner, moving back into the black after a three-year slump. Max Clifford's rather different brand of publicity management continues to supply the tabloids with a stream of sex, gossip and scandal, ensuring him a regular place in the MediaGuardian 100. The PR guru's clients are in the news most weeks and he was behind one the News of the World's biggest ever scoops; the allegations that David Beckham had an affair with a former assistant in Spain. Mr Clifford (number 66) deftly managed the publicity for Rebecca Loos, the woman at the centre of the scandal, ensuring the story dominated the headlines for several weeks earlier this year. Along with Mr Clifford, Matthew Freud continues to exert an unseen but powerful influence across the tabloid and celebrity scene, generating column inches for his clients as well as himself. But Mr Freud's influence also extends to big business and one of his key clients, Charles Dunstone, the entrepreneur behind Carphone Warehouse, also makes an appearance in this year's top 10. Mr Dunstone, already an influential figure in the mobile phone retail market and seen as one of the most creative businessmen of his generation, took the plunge with the launch last year of his own telecoms company, Talk Talk. By offering subscribers free calls, Talk Talk he has taken a significant chunk out of BT's customer base and has gained a high profile through intensive marketing, including the sponsorship of Big Brother and a TV campaign cheekily using Maureen Lipman, the former star of BT's Beattie adverts. Meanwhile, Mr Fitzgerald's departure for Reuters leaves the Procter &amp; Gamble UK boss, Chris de Lapuente, and the Tesco marketing supremo, Tim Mason, to fight for the title of the country's most powerful marketing man. Mr de Lapuente wields enormous clout as head of the country's biggest advertiser. However, Tesco's ambition to expand its role in consumers' lives seems to know no bounds. The supermarket chain highlighted its domination of the retail industry earlier this year, reporting profits of \u00a31.6bn. Mr Mason has been influential in extending the brand into new areas such as telecoms and an in-store TV channel. The combination Ms Loos' allegations, Euro 2004 and a slew of product endorsement deals have pushed David Beckham's profile higher than ever. Elevated into this year's top 10 is Julian Henry, the founder of celebrity PR company Henry's House and overseer of much of the behind-the-scenes activity that oils the Beckham image machine. Mr Henry has close links to Simon Fuller's 19 Management and has also handled PR for Pop Idol stars Michelle McManus and Will Young as well as past Big Brother housemates. He helped Caroline McAteer, the Beckhams' longstanding publicist, set up CM Publicity, which launched the PR fightback in the wake of Ms Loos' revelations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
