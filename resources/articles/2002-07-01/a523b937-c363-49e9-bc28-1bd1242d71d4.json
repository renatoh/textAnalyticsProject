He is also the author of Annie's Box, an exploration of family life in the Darwin household and the effect on Darwin of the death of his ten-year-old daughter Annie. Buy Annie's Box at Amazon.co.uk On Evolution - The Development of the Theory of Natural Selection by Charles Darwin, edited by Thomas Glick and David Kohn Darwin was always toying with ideas as he observed and experimented, and one way to understand the theory of evolution is to follow in his mental footsteps. Glick and Kohn track his journey; they explain the central themes and provide the key passages together with Darwin's comments to friends as he faced up to all the questions he had to answer. Victorian Sensation - The Extraordinary Publication, Reception and Secret Authorship of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation by James Secord Robert Chambers had started the argument about evolution with his Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, 14 years before Darwin declared his theory. Secord explains how people read and reacted to Chambers's history of all life as a natural development towards humanity. The debates were fierce and Secord shows how they were shot through by social and religious concerns. In Mendel's Footnotes - An Introduction to the Science and Technologies of Genes and Genetics from the Nineteenth Century to the Twenty-Second by Colin Tudge Mendel's genetics is the key to the whole theory - a simple idea with implications that cut deep into our thinking about animal and human nature, and a developing technology that gives us Frankenstein's power to experiment with them. Tudge draws the idea out of Mendel's observations in his monastery garden, traces its growth into our present understanding and sets out today's questions about genetic manipulation and its use. In the Name of Eugenics - Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity by Daniel Kevles A fascinating history of the most dangerous temptation of evolutionary theory. Kevles shows how eugenics became a 'cruel and problematic faith' as scientists and moralists groped their way through the politics of the last century. The book is a lesson for today about the perils of applying science in social thinking. The Beak of the Finch - A Story of Evolution in Our Time by Jonathan Weiner An obsessive finch-watch in the Galapagos has revealed evolutionary pressures working from season to season on flocks of different kinds struggling to survive among the cacti and scrub. Weiner's account of Peter Grant's discoveries brings the process of natural selection into close focus with rich and compelling detail. Wonderful Life - The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History by Stephen Jay Gould Gould explains how the ancient lobsters of the Burgess Shale prompted a recasting of the fossil record, and weaves in a deeply unsettling moral about contingency in evolutionary trends. His writings about natural history are intoxicating, and Wonderful Life is his masterpiece. It conveys the imaginative thrill of scientific understanding as vividly as any other book I know. The Origins of Virtue by Matt Ridley Dawkins has said that if The Selfish Gene were to have a second volume on humans, Matt Ridley's book is 'pretty much how it ought to be'. Ridley takes up Dawkins's idea and develops it to offer an explanation of human social origins. His examples and analogies add depth and range. The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee by Jared Diamond Diamond explains how embarrassingly close humans are to the man-like apes and invites us to rethink some of the darker aspects of human nature through an appreciation of our animal ancestry. Watch out for kung-fu kerosene drinking on which he hangs a point. The Water Babies by Charles Kingsley Nothing to do with Pears soap as I had presumed it was until I read it, but the first literary response to The Origin of Species and still unrivalled for its surreal fantasy and wit. This edition has the Victorian cartoonist Linley Sambourne's hauntingly naturalistic illustrations, and costs only \u00a31. If you don't know the book, just treat yourself!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
