The 40-year-old former England goalkeeper has suffered a recurring shoulder problem and was substituted after 13 minutes of Manchester City's Barclaycard Premiership defeat at Portsmouth on Saturday. \"I have reached this difficult decision after much discussion with my family and those in the game whose views I respect,\" he said. \"It has become clear to me that this type of injury will not quickly disappear - and I think now would be a good time to hang up my boots, rather than at the end of the season as planned.\" Seaman added on the club's official website: \"I believe I have had a fantastic career playing at the highest level. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those people who have stood by me and supported my career, especially during the tough times, the players who I will miss for their professionalism and friendship and the fans who have inspired my enthusiasm for the game.\" Seaman, who won 75 England caps, also had a good luck message for his successor, David James. \"After deciding to retire it was a pleasure to recommend David James - so I know the position is in safe hands,\" he added. \"I wish him all the best. He is joining a great club with a first class manager in Kevin Keegan and a great squad. \"I am looking forward to getting the shoulder better in order to explore potential goalkeeper coaching opportunities.\" Kevin Keegan, who signed Seaman on a year's contract from Arsenal in July, added: \"This has been a difficult decision for David - but I fully respect it. \"It says a lot about the man that he has been incredibly helpful to us as a club in finding a successor at such a testing personal time for him. \"His record is incredible and his achievements unbelievable but most importantly I will remember him as an ultimate professional who cared about others.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
