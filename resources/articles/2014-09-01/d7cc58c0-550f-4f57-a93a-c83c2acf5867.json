This latest brings together music for the Hapsburg court, from Heinrich Isaac, composer to Maximilian I from 1497, to Alonso Lobo\u2019s funeral motet for Philip II in 1598. It\u2019s stretching a point to include Tallis, but there is marvellously varied and powerful music here \u2013 more so than the rather uniform declamation suggests. Even at moments of great fervour like the climax of Nicolas Gombert\u2019s Magnificat, the feeling is cool. It makes you wonder: would this music have ever sounded this polite?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
