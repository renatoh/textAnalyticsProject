Both Tignes, with a lower slope depth of 50cm and upper of 140cm, and Val d'Is\u00e8re, 90cm lower and 140cm upper, have excellent skiing as a result. Bar\u00e8ges in the Pyrenees had three days of snowfall early last week and has depths of 70cm low down and 130cm up above. Sauze d'Oulx in Italy had over a metre of snow in just two days. Across the pond, California has received the greatest quantity, resulting in excellent conditions. There's nothing woolly about the slopes at Mammoth with 210cm of consolidated snow depth on the lower slopes and 240cm on the uppers and it's been falling like manna at Heavenly, with a lower depth of 125cm and upper of 200cm. Colorado has had substantial falls (averaging 25cm), Utah resorts have had a dusting of fresh snow and Canada has enjoyed a glistening combination of sunlight and snowfall.
