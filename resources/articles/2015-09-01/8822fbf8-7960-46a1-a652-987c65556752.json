I\u2019m not sure how to deal with it, but we have to find a way.\u201d Hansen was frustrated by the lengthy TMO delays too, adding: \u201cWe have said that right from the beginning that if someone commits foul play we need to know about it. But you would like it to be sped up a little bit if they can.\u201d New Zealand\u2019s captain, Sam Cane, agreed. \u201cWhen the game is so stop-start, you try to speak to the ref but it\u2019s a bit frustrating, I just want to play some footie.\u201d But Hansen praised Namibia, who he said were worthy opponents despite their lowly world ranking. \u201cI am really happy for Namibia, they are a good bunch of guys and I thought they acquitted themselves commendably,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they got tired near the end of the game it became quite messy, that is what you expect, but early in the game they committed themselves totally to the breakdown and the tackle and they should be really proud of themselves. They were worthy opponents. They gave everything they could give.\u201d The Namibia captain Jacques Burger, whose bloodied eyes and nose made him looked like a prizefighter in his post-match press conference, also paid tribute to his team. \u201cWe are a brave bunch of guys, who fight to the very end,\u201d he said. \u201cI am massively proud.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
