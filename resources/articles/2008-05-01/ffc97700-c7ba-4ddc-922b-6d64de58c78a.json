This summer, King Arthur has at last come back to England. Edward Burne-Jones's eerily monumental painting The Sleep of Arthur in Avalon has been in Puerto Rico since 1963, when the millionaire politician Luis A Ferr\u00e9, an inspired collector, bought it for his purpose-built Museo de Arte de Ponce. Another of Ferr\u00e9's prescient purchases was Frederic Leighton's Flaming June. The huge size of Arthur in Avalon, which is 24 feet long, has made it prohibitively expensive to transport. It was noticeably absent both from the 1973 Burne-Jones exhibition at the Hayward Gallery and the 1998 centenary show that travelled to Birmingham via the Met in New York. British Burne-Jones enthusiasts despaired of ever seeing it. But now - with a touch of ancient magic? - this great painting has arrived at Tate Britain as the centre of an exhibition on Burne-Jones and Arthurian legend that runs for the next year. Why were Victorians so gripped by the stories of King Arthur? The 19th-century fixation with Arthurian ideals of chivalry and heroism had its origins in Alfred Tennyson's \"Morte d'Arthur\", published in the first instalment of Idylls of the King in 1842. Burne-Jones's Arthur in Avalon was the culmination of a succession of contemporary writings and works of art based on the Arthurian legend in which the hero-king was taken as an exemplar of how life could still be lived in the Victorian age. William Dyce's frescoes for the robing room at the Palace of Westminster, the most important public commission of the period, seized on Arthurian legend as the inspiration for 19th-century good government. The cenotaph effigy to the dead Prince Albert unveiled at Windsor by a grieving Queen Victoria takes the form of a recumbent knight, a sleeping Arthur. Perhaps Victoria hoped he, too, would rise again. To the pre-Raphaelite artists and their followers, the Arthurian legend had a special resonance. It was partly the pictorial splendours they could find in it: glinting armour, flashing swords, unfurling banners, attendant maidens in gently flowing robes. Even more, however, it was the moral fervour. The mid-Victorian pre-Raphaelites hijacked the Arthurian as part of their crusade against a crass and squalid materialistic age. When Burne-Jones and William Morris, then Oxford undergraduates, began reading Le Morte d'Arthur in its 15th-century Malory original, it seeped into their souls and affected their whole outlook. \"Nothing,\" Burne-Jones wrote, \"was ever like Morte d'Arthur - I don't mean any book or any one poem - something that can never be written, I mean, and can never go out of the heart.\" For Morris and Burne-Jones, Malory was a shared mania. In early days, Morris himself made a few Arthurian paintings, working with Rossetti and Burne-Jones on the mural decorations for the Oxford Union, but his interpretations of the legends were predominantly literary. Morris's Arthurian poems are rougher than Tennyson's, edgier, more erotic and more psychologically astute. For Burne-Jones, the great thrill of the Arthurian was visual, and he pursued themes of the San Graal in paintings, drawings, designs for stained glass and tapestries throughout his life. In particular, the theme of the slumbering King Arthur had reverberated in Burne-Jones's mind for decades: \"I have designed many pictures that are to be painted in Avalon - secure me a famous wall, for I have much to say.\" In 1881, he was given a commission by his aristocratic artist friend George Howard, later ninth Earl of Carlisle, for a painting of King Arthur for his library at Naworth Castle in Cumberland. Burne-Jones had already designed a large-scale Cupid and Psyche frieze for the dining room of Howard's London house, 1 Palace Green. The gestation of Cupid and Psyche was long and problematic, but that of Arthur in Avalon was even more so. It got larger and more ambitious by the year. According to his wife, Georgiana, Burne-Jones regarded the picture \"as a task of love to which he put no limit of time or labour\". Howard reacted with realistic fortitude, eventually accepting in lieu a rather less exciting panel designed by Burne-Jones, depicting Flodden Field. The Sleep of Arthur in Avalon is a wonderful example of a painting taking over an artist's life. Burne-Jones was 49 when he began it, and he was still working on it in old age. Its great size was of the essence. After travelling in Italy, he had returned to England enraptured by the possibilities of making large-scale cycles of art to fill big public buildings, as had been the norm in the Renaissance. Arthur in Avalon was one of a series of ambitious projects, \"huge cloudy symbols of a high romance\", which included a great triptych of the Trojan war and a set of pictures representing the four ages of the world. Because the painting was too large for Burne-Jones's studio at home in Fulham, a special studio was rented on Campden Hill. The concept developed slowly through a series of modellos and studies, some of which are in the Tate exhibition. The still centre of the composition derives from book XXI of Malory, in which the king, mortally wounded, has been brought to the vale of Avalon by his sister Queen Morgan le Fay, on whose lap, in Burne-Jones's final version of the painting, the king's head rests. Earlier schemes had involved a battle raging in the background and a cluster of hill fairies in the mountains listening to the music made by the mourning queens. Burne-Jones wisely abandoned these \"he-fairies and she-fairies, looking ecstatic and silly and very uncombed\" in favour of a gravely linear composition centred on the outstretched figure of the king beneath the golden canopy embellished with scenes from the quest for the Holy Grail. Slumped and somnolent figures awaiting the recall to life are a Burne-Jones speciality. The Sleeping Beauty series at Buscot Park in Oxfordshire has a similar quality of belle inertie. Arthur in Avalon is full of this weird stillness, the sense of time suspended that admirers of his paintings, including Picasso, regarded as quintessential Burne-Jones. The artist's attention to detail was obsessive. Once he had decided to fill the foreground of Arthur in Avalon with summer flowers, he brought columbines, irises and forget-me-nots into the studio to study closely. At Brindley's marble works in Westminster, he looked at the structures of the different coloured marble blocks until he \"learned\" them: \"When I shut my eyes last night I could see nothing but the petrified waves and tide-marks and signs of skimming winds on wet surfaces.\" The oddness of his painting arises from intense verisimilitude. It was not by any means a simple jingoistic picture. He did not take the Arthurian legend at face value, but used it as a critique of Victorian society. Burne-Jones grew up in the 1840s in Birmingham, a rapidly expanding industrial city, and his social conscience developed early on. As a young man intended for the priesthood, he had been involved in idealistic schemes for a mixed community of monastic and lay members, an early example of an outreach mission for big cities, tackling urban poverty and immorality. In the 1870s, Burne-Jones had been drawn into the Eastern Question Association, a liberal pressure group formed to promote resistance to Disraeli's alliance with the Turks. The failure of the association to influence events deeply disillusioned him, and from then on he withdrew from active politics, feeling that an artist's time was better spent producing works of art that challenged contemporary mores. Arthur in Avalon was his great gesture of social dissidence. His wife described it as \"a story that to him was an explanation of life he felt intolerable\". A painful irony was that, as Burne-Jones withdrew from politics, William Morris became more ferocious in his views. In 1883, he joined the Democratic Federation and then formed his own socialist revolutionary party, the Socialist League. Burne-Jones watched with anguish Morris's day-to-day involvement in street preaching, demonstrating, incendiary marches on Trafalgar Square, feeling that he was dissipating his creative energies. In the background to the painting of Arthur lies this real-life narrative of strain on an old, close friendship. It is a terribly melancholy picture, overlaid with mourning for the shattering of youthful hopes, the breaking up of brotherhoods. For Burne-Jones, Morris had always been, and still remained, the king. By the early 1890s, Arthur in Avalon was back in Burne-Jones's garden studio in Fulham \"where for another seven years he poured his heart in it\", according to his wife. Contemporary photographs show Avalon jammed in at right angles to another of his long-running epic paintings, The Car of Love, now in the V&amp;A. Semi-reconciled with Morris, Burne-Jones collaborated with him on their best-known joint project: the tremendous sequence of Holy Grail tapestries woven at the Morris &amp; Co works in Merton Abbey. \"Back to our old things,\" as Morris put it, conscious that they were by now old men. The century was ending, and with it the near-sacred mid-Victorian respect for the Arthurian. Burne-Jones and Morris were united in disgust with Aubrey Beardsley's impudently sexual version of Morte d'Arthur, which seemed to them obscene. In 1897, the year after Morris's death, the still unfinished painting was moved for the last time. The largest studio in London was taken for Avalon to allow Burne-Jones to view the composition from a distance. A later occupant, Sir Frank Brangwyn, described the purpose-built St Paul's Studios in West Kensington as a workspace fit for Michelangelo. The studios, which still exist, were later taken over by the Russian ballet teacher Nicolai Legat. After Legat died, his body lay in state in the same great space where Edward Burne-Jones laboured on the painting of King Arthur on his bier. The records of that year give the sense that Burne-Jones was running out of time. He resented all interruptions to the work. Summoned to attend Queen Victoria's jubilee celebrations at the palace, he went reluctantly and stayed only very briefly, desperate to return to Avalon. He refused to be distracted by news of the declaration of war between America and Spain, or alarming rumours of Cecil Rhodes's imperialist policies in Africa: \"I let it pass. I shall let most things pass me by. I must, if ever I want to reach Avalon.\" His self-identification with the work was now so great that his letters from the studio were headed simply \"Avalon\". \"I am at Avalon - not yet in Avalon,\" he wrote to Georgiana. Was he wilfully procrastinating, foreseeing that completing the painting would be the end of him? His own health was failing badly. He complained of throbbing heart and failing eyesight. When he went to sleep, exhausted, he took up the exact pose of the slumbering King Arthur. Shafts of his cranky humour still illuminate Burne-Jones's conversations of that period, recorded by his studio assistant Thomas Rooke: \"A pity it is I was not born in the middle ages.\" \"It would have suited you exactly,\" Rooke replied. Burne-Jones was now beginning to lose faith in his own judgment, questioning in his black moments whether the vast painting in which he had invested 17 years of painful concentration \"might turn out no more than a piece of decoration with no meaning in it all\". He began acting on other people's suggestions for improving it, often a bad sign. When May Gaskell, current object of Burne-Jones's adoration, criticised some rocks, he painted them out, replacing them with flowers. On June 18 1898, Burne-Jones reckoned the painting still required another two months' work. But that was the night on which he summoned Georgiana through the speaking tube that connected their two bedrooms and died of a heart attack. The never-quite-completed Arthur in Avalon was hauled out and put on show at the Royal Academy in 1916, a centrepiece of the by then rampant chivalric revival rallying the troops and glorifying the fallen in the first world war. This simplistic interpretation of his masterwork would have driven the artist mad. Where to place Burne-Jones? His work is so varied, so particular and strange, that he has always been a puzzle. The recent British Vision exhibition in Ghent put him firmly and convincingly within a tradition of prophetic intensity that runs from William Blake to Stanley Spencer. The contemporary artist Christopher Le Brun views Burne-Jones as \"a proto-surrealist\", and certainly The Sleep of Arthur in Avalon appears in reproduction as brilliantly surreal. But Burne-Jones is unpredictable. It is impossible to know till we get face to face with Arthur whether this is the magnum opus he intended; fixing his reputation as the most important of all late Victorian painters - or a gigantic aberration. \u00b7 Burne-Jones and the Sleep of Arthur in Avalon is at Tate Britain, London SW1, until February 1 2009.
