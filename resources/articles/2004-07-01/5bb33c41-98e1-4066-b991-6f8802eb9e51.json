The information came through leaked extracts from his testimony to an investigating judge on July 1. Millar's lawyer Paul-Albert Iweins said yesterday that the Scot would receive a letter of dismissal from Cofidis \"today or tomorrow\", and a Cofidis spokesman confirmed that the letter sacking him had been posted on Monday. Millar was left out of the Tour de France by his team after the drug inquiry, provisionally suspended from all cycling and dropped from Britain's Olympic team. The Scot was interviewed for two hours yesterday in the Paris suburb of Nanterre by Richard Pallain, the judge leading the inquiry into alleged drug-taking in the Cofidis team, and was then confronted face to face with his former team-mate Philippe Gaumont, who has made allegations about him. \"Both of them remained set in their positions,\" said Iweins. \"David Millar has accepted what he has done but will not accept what Gaumont accuses him of doing. On a certain number of points Gaumont has changed his version, perhaps to make it seem more realistic. Mr Millar has recognised a certain number of facts that are not those of which Gaumont has accused him.\" Millar's sister Frances, who manages his affairs, yesterday confirmed to the Guardian that her brother had told her that the page of extracts, published in the newspaper L'Equipe yesterday, was genuine \"word for word\". She added that Millar accepted that this confirmation through her might lead to the loss of his world time-trial title. According to the extracts, Millar stated to Judge Pallain: \"I did two courses [of EPO] in May and August 2003 . . . The objectives I was aiming for after these courses of treatment were the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 [stage race] and the world time-trial championship in Canada. I had dreamed of becoming world champion and I got there but I had cheated.\" Millar added that he had kept two syringes, which had contained EPO he had injected in Manchester en route to the world championships, and took them to his home in Biarritz. He did so \"as a way of keeping myself away from it, so that I would never forget that I had become world champion at Hamilton while doped\". Cycling's governing body, the UCI, said yesterday that if the 27-year-old confirmed the truth of what was printed in L'Equipe in public or to a disciplinary body he would lose his world title, and the rainbow jersey and gold medal would revert to the runner-up, the Australian Michael Rogers. \"Normally we cannot use information from a legal inquiry which is confidential,\" said a UCI member yesterday. \"But if Millar confirms what he has said, in public or in front of a disciplinary body, there is no need to wait for the end of the legal process.\" It may be that his sister's statement yesterday will be enough for him to be stripped of the rainbow jersey, even before he puts his case to a disciplinary commission of the domestic governing body, British Cycling, which will examine him before August 5. The only previous situation of this kind concerned the 1996 world mountain-bike champion J\u00e9r\u00f4me Chiotti. The Frenchman confirmed in an autobiography that he had used drugs to take the title and formally handed over the rainbow jersey to the runner-up, the Swiss Thomas Frischknecht."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
