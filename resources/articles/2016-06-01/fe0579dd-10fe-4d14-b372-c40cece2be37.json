In a joint article published on Thursday, the two charities say that \u201cyears of uncertainty\u201d would follow a vote to leave. \u201cThe safer option for our wildlife and environment is for the UK to remain within the EU,\u201d they say. Moving the EU referendum debate on to greener terrain, the prime minister backed the charities\u2019 call with a promise to protect the birds and habitats directives, currently the subject of a \u201cfitness check in Brussels. \u201cEU membership underpins many crucial environmental protections in the UK, while amplifying our voice in the world on vital issues like cutting global emissions,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cI will use our seat at the table to ensure the natural environment, biodiversity and a living, working countryside are at the heart of agricultural policy through continued reform of the CAP [common agricultural policy], and that the birds and habitats directives are maintained and better implemented, both in the UK and across Europe, to ensure the diversity of our countryside and wildlife.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s intervention follows behind-the-scenes pressure from high-profile Conservatives that he make a strong statement on the environmental benefits of EU membership. Cameron will visit the RSPB\u2019s Rainham Marshes nature reserve on Thursday where he is expected to meet with the conservation body\u2019s members and make a short joint statement with its chief executive, Mike Clark. Turning to the EU\u2019s environmental record may also be a partial response to attempts by the leave camp to turn green directives from Brussels into a referendum issue. On Monday, the pro-Brexit farms, food and fisheries minister George Eustice called the birds and habitats directives \u201crigid\u201d and \u201cspirit-crushing\u201d and said they should be scrapped. \u201cOnce you abdicate responsibility for something like the environment to the EU, there is a danger that it infantilises the government machine at all levels and people just sit and wait to be told what to do,\u201d Eustice said. \u201cThere is no flexibility. It just becomes about trying to obey the letter of the law from Brussels, and you are often forced to do things the wrong way.\u201d In their article on Thursday, the RSPB and WWF make a counter-argument, saying that because flora and fauna transcend national boundaries, cross-border cooperation and international standards are needed to enable it to thrive. Clarke said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s membership of the EU has benefited nature and the environment in ways that would be hard to replicate if we left. We want a secure future for our most precious wildlife and the places they call home. In weighing up the current evidence, the uncertainties and the balance of risks, we have concluded that the safer option for nature is for the UK to remain a part of the European Union.\u201d As well as protecting 18% of Europe\u2019s land under the nature directives, EU legislation is credited with a plethora of environmental improvements from curbing acid rain and reducing air pollution, to cutting vehicle emissions and banning growth hormones. Conservationists say that laws from Brussels have restricted waste dumping in landfill sites, promoted a culture of recycling and kicked off a continent-wide reduction in carbon emissions. David Nussbaum, the chief executive of WWF in the UK, said: \u201cThe outcome of this referendum will have profound implications for our countryside, wildlife, rivers and seas. David Cameron is right to put the environment at the top of the agenda today, and he has highlighted the range of benefits that EU membership has delivered for our species and habitats.\u201d WWF has begun a #thinkenvironment campaign and is launching a pro-remain advert."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
