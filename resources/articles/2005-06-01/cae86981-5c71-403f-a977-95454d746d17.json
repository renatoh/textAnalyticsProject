Federer's main challenger is likely to be Andy Roddick, while Justine Henin-Hardenne and Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo should cause some problems for Sharapova. Geldof in Africa 7.30pm, BBC1 In this lush and enlightening documentary, Bob Geldof takes a personal journey through Africa in an effort to explore the continent and its development. \"Here,\" he says, \"heat is a shape, a form, even a taste.\" Stonehenge - The Ultimate Experiment - Live! 7.30pm, Five This is the first of a two-part live broadcast in which archaeologists and historians will attempt to rebuild Stonehenge as it was constructed 4,000 years ago. Using weighted-down polystyrene blocks at a secret location close to the original site, the team will attempt to \"recreate and explore\" the mystery of Stonehenge. Admittedly, it does all sound slightly farcical.

Spirituality Shopper 8pm, Channel 4 The last in the series focuses on Charlie Coughlan, who has suffered from depression since the breakdown of his marriage and the death of his father. \"I feel as if I'm a bottle of Coke that's gone flat,\" says Charlie, who describes himself as somewhere between an atheist and an agnostic. To help him to regain his zest for life, Jonathan Edwards introduces him to Taoist tai chi, Islamic prayer, Quaker contemplation and Pagan drumming. \"I've done more in the last few days than I have in eight months,\" says Charlie after sampling each spiritual practice, \"I don't know if I can cope with this or not.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
