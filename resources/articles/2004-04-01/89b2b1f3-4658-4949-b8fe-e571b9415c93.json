Meanwhile, a White House official confirmed tonight that John Negroponte, will become the US ambassador to Iraq. Mr Negroponte, who is currently the most senior American diplomat at the United Nations, will effectively replace the civilian administrator, Paul Bremer as the top US official in Iraq during the sensitive period leading up to the hand-over of power from the coalition to Iraqis on June 30. That transfer date has been put under some question following an upsurge in violence in Iraq in recent weeks and Falluja is a major flashpoint and the centre of Sunni insurgency. But today in the first signs of real progress in talks between the civic leaders in the city and Iraqi governing council representatives, officials outlined a joint communiqu\u00e9 expected to be issued later today that proposes lifting the two-week siege and restoring control to Iraqi police. Major General Mark Kimmitt, the deputy director of operations in Iraqi, said the US military would not attack the city if rebels take up the amnesty offer and hand in their machine guns, rocket launchers and other weapons. If the proposed deal fails, he added, marines were braced to launch an immediate offensive. \"It would appear there is an agreed political track. There is also a very clear understanding ... that should this agreement not go through, marine forces are more than prepared to carry through with military operations\" and could seize Falluja \"in fairly short order,\" he said at his daily briefing. At the same briefing, spokesman Dan Senor outlined other proposals contained in the joint statement, including steps towards improving the humanitarian situation in the besieged city by lifting the strict curfew and movement restrictions, and allowing access to citizens from other areas to visit friends and relatives. Troops from the 1st Marine Division surrounded the city nearly two weeks ago after a flare-up in insurgent attacks on the US-led forces. A series of fierce engagements - which are believed to have resulted in the death of many civilians in Falluja - gave way to a fragile truce as negotiations began last week. According to the statement, all parties \"welcomed the improved situation in the city of Falluja and committed themselves to take all possible measures to implement a full and unbroken cease-fire,\" Mr Senor said. \"The parties agreed that coalition forces do not intend to resume offensive operations if all persons inside the city turn on the heavy weapons ... Individual violators will be dealt with on individual basis,\" he added. The situation also appeared to be improving in the city of Najaf, where the US military announced plans for a cut in troop numbers. The development comes amid signs of progress in talks to end the tense standoff with radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Colonel Dana Pittard, commander of the 2,500-strong 3rd Brigade Task Force outside Najaf - where Mr Sadr is holed up with hundreds of his Mahdi fighters - said the force would be withdrawn over the coming days, and would be replaced by around 2,000 soldiers from the 1st Armoured Division. It is the latest sign that the US commanders, who are eager to avoid a costly battle in the city, could be preparing to back away from their pledge to \"kill or capture\" Mr Sadr. With US marines in western Iraq facing the deadliest guerrilla resistance since the fall of Saddam Hussein last year, and with Spain poised to pull its 1,400 troops out of central Shia regions, the US military is wary of enraging Iraqis by sending troops into one of the most sacred cities in Shia Islam. Instead, it appears to be placing more faith in ceasefire negotiations, which are under way through Iraqi and Iranian intermediaries in an effort to find a peaceful solution to the impasse. \"Because of where negotiations are right now, we can wait,\" Col Pittard said. \"We still want Iraqis to solve the problem.\" Meanwhile, Mr Sadr called for a halt to attacks on Spanish troops in Iraq because of Spain's decision to withdraw its troops. \"The attacks on Spanish troops should be stopped since they are returning to their country and as long as they don't carry out aggressions against the Iraqi people,\" said a statement from Mr Sadr's office in the southern city of Najaf. Spain said the early withdrawal of its troops should not harm long-term relations with the US. The Spanish foreign minister, Miguel Moratinos, said that Spain continued to support the US-led effort to rebuild Iraq, and remained steadfast in the fight against terrorism. \"We're not washing our hands [of the situation in Iraq]\", he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
