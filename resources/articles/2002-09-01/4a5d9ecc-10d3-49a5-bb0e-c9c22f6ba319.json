And he is looking to youth to propel the club forward. The 46-year-old Welshman has replaced Nick Cusack, whose disastrous six-month, 18-game reign ended with the club 92nd in the Football League. With Flynn has come his former No2 at Wrexham, Kevin Reeves; the future of Alan Curtis, who was Cusack's assistant, is uncertain, although he has been asked to continue as a coach. Frank Burrows, Jan Molby, Micky Adams, Alan Cork and John Hollins have left Swansea since 1995. \"The stats produced by the League Managers Association executive committee, of which I have been part, make horrible reading,\" said Flynn. \"I come to Swansea initially to the end of the season. I have a longer-term view but departure is part of soccer.\" The immediate task for Flynn, who left Wrexham almost 12 months ago after a 12-year stint, is to stop them sliding into the Nationwide Conference. Swansea dropped to the bottom of the Third Division when they lost 1-0 to Boston on Wednesday. They have won only one of their 10 matches and have conceded 22 goals. \"I already know quite a lot about the squad,\" said Flynn. \"I was at Boston and saw a few of the club's games last season. I'm aware of the individuals we have and I know we have enough strength to get us out of trouble. \"But the facts speak for themselves. If you concede too many goals there is something wrong. I have always believed in a collective effort. If strikers are not taking their chances, it puts pressure on the defence.\" The former Burnley and Wales midfielder added: \"Both Kevin and myself might have been out of football management for a while but we haven't been sitting at home. We have watched soccer at every level. We know of the players around and have noted where the weaknesses are in this Swansea side.\" Flynn, born 10 miles from the Vetch Field in Port Talbot, has an immediate aim - to establish a youth policy like the one that helped Wrexham during the 1990s. During his time with Wrexham he nurtured talent and made substantial profits for the club when selling players. \"We need to be looking to attract boys into the club from the age of 10. Some of the biggest names in Welsh football came from this area, people like John Charles and Ivor Allchurch,\" he said. \"We have to give ourselves a chance by getting the best young players. It's our way forward.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
