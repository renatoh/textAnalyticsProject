Cartegena", "bodyText": "Why? It's a beautiful, quaint fishing town on the Atlantic coast of Colombia, full of pastel-painted buildings, Spanish colonial architecture and magnificent cathedrals. There's also an old fortress portion of the city similar to the kind you find on the coastline of Africa. It's one of those places where you can really see and feel the history everywhere. Gabriel Garcia Marquez lives in the old part of town and it does feel like something out of one of his novels. What's the best thing? It has wonderful restaurants, beautiful beaches, and it's one place that has not been visited by the violence so common in the rest of Colombia, so it still feels pretty safe place for tourists. Because the country has such a violent reputation, very few tourists go there, so you pretty much have the run of the place, which is nice. My perfect day: After sleeping late, I'd get up and go down to the courtyard of my hotel to enjoy the ocean breeze and read the newspapers. I'd go for a walk, a swim, and maybe a sail in the afternoon. After a good siesta, I'd head out looking for a meal at one of the great seafood places along the coastline - hopefully with a nice, romantic companion. My advice: It's important to know somebody there, or at least to be with somebody who knows the country really well. If you're in Bogot\u00e1, it's better not to go out after sunset as the guerrillas lie in wait for westerners to kidnap. But remember: there are risks involved in going just about anywhere. Getting there: Avianca (08705 767747, www.avianca.com) offers return flights from London to Cartagena, via a same-day connection in Bogot\u00e1 from around \u00a3613. Mark Bowden's new book about the life and death of Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar, Killing Pablo, is published by Atlantic Books at \u00a316.99."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
