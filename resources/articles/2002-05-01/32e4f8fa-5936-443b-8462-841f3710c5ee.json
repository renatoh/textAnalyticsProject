That's all about to change, as his cornucopia of long-gestating projects finally unspools. In the first, second world war drama Hart's War, Farrell stars alongside Bruce Willis as upper crust US Air Force Officer and POW Tommy Hart. In July, Farrell will star alongside Tom Cruise in Steven Spielberg's Minority Report. His upcoming slate is equally starry - he recently wrapped The Farm opposite Al Pacino, is currently filming Daredevil in LA with Ben Affleck, and later this year will play Alexander The Great in Oliver Stone's epic biopic. Playing a posh Yale graduate must have been a stretch The hardest job I've ever done. Tommy Hart is so still and mannered. There was an element of me that wanted to go, \"Shut the fuck up, man, you're lucky. Realise it and get on with it.\" It came down to his being an animal of nurture, rather than nature. I even went to Yale for a couple of weeks and stayed on campus there in digs akin to what Tommy Hart would have lived in. You're hardly the still, mannered type No. And talking slower is one of the trickiest things. I really rabbit on. But I have a good dialect coach I work with all the time. I'm screwed when it comes to improvisation, but familiarity breeds confidence. It's just about habitual repetition, repetition, repetition, and I'm contemptuous of the habitual! But not of Bruce Willis? No, he's great. Works hard and plays hard too. Looking at it from a fanatic's point of view, I grew up on Moonlighting and saw all his movies so it could have been intimidating if he made it that way. But he never wanted to get into a pissing contest. What about Minority Report? I really get to play in that, and work with Tom Cruise. I didn't work with Samantha Morton unfortunately, which is a shame because she's an amazing actress, but it was a blast. I play a young employee of the Justice Department. Did you feel you had something to prove to Cruise and Spielberg? There's an element of that in every job you do. I have a lot to prove to myself more than anyone else in the world. And if you're going to be up there messing with the big boys, you do want to do your homework, learn your lines, and give it your best shot. Speaking of big boys, how was it working with Al Pacino? That was the most intimidated I've been. Of course. I went out for dinner with Pacino for about three hours before filming started and we just talked shite. But you know, you cut them and they bleed. They're all human beings and all the experiences I've had with them have been different for sure because of the pieces, but I've enjoyed every second of them all. Have you remained a Dublin boy at heart? I still have the same friends. My mother's still my mother. And at the end of the day, whenever I finish a job I'm on the first plane home to Dublin. I have to pick up my pace a little because I maybe have to be somewhere at a certain time, but that's about it. Everything around me is more mad than it's ever been, but I don't feel the pressure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
