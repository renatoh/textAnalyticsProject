Adriano Guedes was removed from the James Paget hospital in Gorleston, Norfolk, which said the 63-year-old was occupying the bed \u201cunnecessarily\u201d and was fit to be discharged. Guedes, who came to the UK from Portugal 15 years ago seeking work and suffers paralysis following a stroke in 2008, said he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to stay\u201d but \u201cthey forced me to stay\u201d. He told the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s very bad to occupy a place which should be used by someone in need, but I didn\u2019t cause the situation; on the contrary, I tried to get out of there.\u201d The hospital obtained a possession order from the court to remove Guedes and it was granted on 1 December and enforced on 10 January. Guedes said he had asked to be moved from the hospital to a \u201cwheelchair-friendly place\u201d and said he had been on hunger strike since his removal, with his last meal on 10 January. He said he was initially admitted to hospital in 2014 on mental health grounds and not because of his physical condition. His request to see a spinal specialist in London for his injuries was ignored, he said, adding: \u201cI wanted to leave, but they always offered what they knew I would refuse.\u201d Guedes, whose hospital stay is estimated to have cost around \u00a3340,000, is now living in a council flat in Suffolk. The Department of Health says the average daily cost of a hospital bed is about \u00a3400. Director of governance at the hospital, Anna Hills, said Guedes had \u201crepeatedly refused all offers of appropriate accommodation organised by our local authority and social care partners, despite being fit for discharge\u201d. The hospital said it had worked \u201cin partnership with a range of agencies to achieve a safe discharge from the hospital\u201d for Guedes. It said \u201cdetailed planning\u201d had taken place which \u201cled to a successful discharge in this complex case\u201d. Guedes has been described as a so-called \u201cbed blocker\u201d, but the NHS Confederation\u2019s director of policy, Johnny Marshall, told the Guardian last year that the term was an inappropriate description of people staying in hospital when they did not need to be there. He said: \u201cThese \u2018blockers\u2019 are often older people who are frail and vulnerable and who would like nothing more than to return home to their families. The phrase \u2018bed blocker\u2019 puts all the emphasis, and blame, on the individual. \u201cThe reality is that it is the system that has failed to move quickly enough to put together the right package of care to enable the person in the bed to return home.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
