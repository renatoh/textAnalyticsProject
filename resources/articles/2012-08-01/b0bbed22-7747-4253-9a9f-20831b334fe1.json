Pardew's annoyance at Burt's refusal to award Newcastle a second-half throw-in is likely to see him serving a touchline ban and being fined. Indeed, it could prove a costly moment as, having instructed his players to adhere to an \"Olympian spirit\" before kick-off, Newcastle's manager \u2013 who will not contest the charge \u2013 is understood to have already subjected himself to a club fine. \"I'm still embarrassed about what I did,\" he said. \"I've never done anything like that before. I've apologised to him [Burt] and I can't really do any more than that. I've been to see him and we sort of smiled about it. I can't turn the clock back so I'll take my punishment. \"It was ridiculous really. The linesman was right in front of me. I thought the ball went out and gave him a little shove. I've been pleading with my players all this week to behave themselves and show Olympic spirit \u2013 and then I get sent off. I can only apologise. \"I've been telling the players to be humble and do everything the right way but they did the right things and I didn't. It was 100% stupid. It was silly. I don't know what I was thinking.\" The FA will wait until they receive the referee's report from Martin Atkinson on Monday before charging Pardew. A broadly comparable incident involving the Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and, coincidentally, Atkinson at Sunderland two years ago brought the Frenchman a one match touchline ban and an \u00a38,000 fine but, in this case, the game's governing body will weigh the need to set a strong example against the Newcastle manager's immediate apology and evident contrition. Meanwhile, Pardew remains concerned that rivals, most notably Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City, will attempt to poach his leading players before the transfer window's closure at the end of the month. Cheik Tiot\u00e9 and Yohan Cabaye are among those rumoured to be in demand. \"I worry about losing all my players because unfortunately we're not Manchester United or Manchester City,\" said Pardew. \"We're always vulnerable. If you ask me, 'Do I sleep well at night?', I'd have to say, 'Not always'. Hopefully I'll get some sleep this week because we'll be away [in Athens for a Europa Cup first-leg qualifier at Atromitos]. But I'm looking forward to 1 September. We'll all know where we are then.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
