I like funky clothes, more goth than chavy. But the clothes I would like to buy, like wide-leg cords, are all too big or pink (ew!!!) Madlen, Swansea I, too, used to loathe pink or girlie clothes. I still don't like pink, but did get into more girlie clothes when I was about 24 and realised I could get more attention from boys that way. I should, of course, point out that there is more to life than getting boys to look at you, but it's not a bad way to spend a year or two. You're a bit out of luck with cords. Not because they're out of fashion but it's the wrong season for them. That doesn't mean no one does them but they're not as widespread (no pun intended) as you'd like. What I've tried to do is round up some good makes for you to look at, and picked out pieces I think you might like. You didn't specify a price, so I've tried to give a good mix with more expensive things thrown in for when you have birthday money to spend, or if you manage to put your dad's vintage vinyl collection on eBay. As for sizing - you need to look at ranges that start before age 12, so that if you don't fit into the age you should - and I speak as someone with a 34FF bosom who somehow manages to fit into a rather lovely Petit Bateau age 16 T-shirt - you have more scope to move downwards. I know it's tempting to look at the bigger ranges as there will be less pink in the \"teen\" ranges than there is for the \"young girl\" ones, but if you look carefully through the latter, you can find stuff free of fairies. At the more expensive end is Jigsaw Junior. Don't be put off by some of the more obvious girlie offerings it has, as there are some fabulous velvet trousers left over from autumn/winter, in sizes from age two to 13, so you will find something to fit you! They come in the goth uniform colours of black or purple, \u00a338.95 (www.jigsaw-online.com, 020-8392 5600). Boden (www.boden.co.uk, 08456 775000) is another great but not obvious place to look; it, too, tends towards the girlie, but it has two pieces that I think you'll really like: cargo cords, code: 32106, \u00a324 in green or violet and wide-leg jeans, code: 32104, \u00a322 (very wide-legged jeans are really big fashion news for next year.) Both come in ages 2-14 years. Boden isn't madly cheap but it has great sales that make everything more affordable. George at Asda Teenwear (www.george.com, 0500-100 055) is also worth a look, again you have to put the blinkers on to get past the pink stuff but there are black combat pants for \u00a312 in ages to fit 9-12. As far as tops go, I really like the Rosie Nieper range of T-shirts for girls (www.rosienieper.co.uk, 020-8614 4776.) The range starts from three and goes up to age 12, so there's plenty of choice for you size-wise. There's a couple of suitable anarchic ones I think you'd like; my particular favourite is the geisha dog one on black, \u00a317, but also brand new is Sweetypuss (a psychotic cat); short-sleeved designs cost \u00a315.95. One sports the legend: \"Boys are strong, bury them deep\", which aren't my sentiments (boys are delicious as far as I'm concerned), but they may be yours. In terms of really plain, cheap T-shirts in lots of colours that aren't pink, Verbaudet (www.verbaudet.co.uk, 0845-270 0270) is a good place to look. The T-shirts come in six styles and nine colours, only two of which are shades of pink - my particular favourite is the butterfly sleeve T-shirt, code 360.4119. A pack of three in sky blue, khaki and white, for example, is approx \u00a38.99 depending on what size you go for. The Kays catalogue \"Rock Out\" range (www.kays.com, 0800-092 622) is also really strong with some stripey vests, \u00a318 for a pack of two, code: JJ1663, that would make suitable wear this summer. Even when stripes are in more girlie colours, I think they still look suitably unisex. Sports labels such as O'Neill (0844-545 2030) are also an interesting brand to look at for more your kind of thing. It will be doing cords this winter but not until September, but in the meantime they have combats at \u00a338 or printed hooded tops for \u00a332. O'Neill is not cheap because it's a sportswear label but it is mega trendy: its sizing is in height, so sizes range from 116cm to 188cm. I hope this goes some way to helping you in your quest!
