The short answer is a huge amount. When it was first being promoted all those years ago before the Communications Act, the very idea of a \"super\" regulator appeared at the very least impractical. It was all very well to talk about \"convergence\" in theory but TV, radio and telecoms are so different that common regulation is surely a non-starter - or so the argument went. Well, at this basic level at least he's done it. We now have one regulator for the whole communications sector instead of five, and it works. By hiring big hitters from the \"strategysphere\" particularly in the world of broadcasting (and mainly from the BBC), he created an organisation that could think big. First signs of what this might mean came with Ofcom's review of public service broadcasting. Evidence gathering and big ideas were to the fore. The commercial broadcasters - used to dealing with the old ITC - didn't know what had hit them. Ofcom came to understand ITV's difficulties - the cost of public service commitments set against the declining value of the analogue spectrum - before the broadcaster's own bosses did. And the definition of public service broadcasting that Ofcom generated was far clearer and more coherent than anything the BBC had managed to come up with, recently at least. (It is impossible to miss the similarity between Ofcom's definitions and Building Public Value, the manifesto produced by the BBC after the arrival of Michael Grade and Mark Thompson.) Once, the BBC was the acknowledged centre of gravity in broadcasting policy making; now Ofcom has seized the mantle. It is also worth noting that Ofcom's broader remit could have led it into serious conflict with the BBC. But that hasn't happened either (yet!). Under Carter, Ofcom has largely followed through the logic of its own analysis. The regulatory burden on ITV has been reduced significantly, and pushed through by Ofcom in the face of considerable public and political opposition. Perhaps paradoxically, given the way that regulation of BBC services is shaping up with the new and detailed Service Licences, Ofcom is felt by many in the content business to have embraced so-called \"light touch\" regulation. In the worlds of radio and telecoms people talk of greater clarity, rigour and transparency - particularly in the awarding of licences. And maybe this represents the key to what Carter and his team have achieved. Sometimes they may have more big ideas than they can handle, and they have a bit of a tendency to pursue radical propositions almost for the sake of it, but Ofcom is, for the most part, an open and professional, evidence-based regulator. And for anyone familiar with the old world of regulation in TV and radio that at least is a breath of fresh air. Will the elderly take to digital? One of the most vexed issues with the great switch to digital - which is, by the way, due to last longer than the second world war - is so-called \"targeted help\". This is money - to be raised as part of the BBC licence fee - to help elderly, vulnerable and poor people to make the switch. People in these groups tend to make even more use of their televisions than the rest of us, so to allow them to be cut off in the process of switchover is close to unthinkable. As yet, no one will say precisely how much money will be allocated for \"targeted help\" or specifically what limits will be put on eligibility. This in itself is causing a degree of nervousness. At Digital UK, the body managing the transfer to digital, there are fears that not enough money will be made available to meet the needs of vulnerable consumers. At the BBC, there are concerns that if the amount of targeted help is high, other parts of its licence fee bid may end up being cut back in order to keep the overall settlement at a politically acceptable level. Nevertheless the results of a trial in Bolton, published last week, looking at what level and type of support the over-75s and other vulnerable people might actually need, offers some clues as to what will have to be done. Although the headline of the DCMS press release said \"98% of older people in Bolton Trial Happy with Digital TV\", the detail was rather more perplexing. Four weeks after having their digital TV equipment installed, some 80% still had problems or couldn't make it work at all. After eight weeks that figure had dropped to 20%. Leaving aside how serious that could be for the 20%, the costs of offering support to the rest for up to eight weeks in addition to the costs of equipment and installation are potentially huge - and probably prohibitively so. So what's the answer? A campaign to engage voluntary groups, family members and neighbours to help out for free. Like a kind of giant long-running 'subotnik' (Soviet free-labour day). Campaigns are being planned. No, really.
