In the same country, only one university, Cardiff, is receiving core funding from the government for its educational research. Of the other three that used to get core funding, Swansea has closed down its educational research and Aberystwyth and Bangor are labouring on with grants that are far less secure. Meanwhile in London, just two education departments, the Institute of Education and King's College, have core funding. The research assessment exercise in 2001, which rated what was going on in universities and institutions of higher education, in effect decided which departments got enhanced, reduced or axed funding. Nationwide, only 14 of the 83 educational research departments got the top 5 or 5* rating that guaranteed core funding. This has led to a concentration of educational research in a few, elite departments. This change has been mirrored in other subjects, too, of course. But the British Educational Research Association (Bera), whose annual conference starts at Manchester University tomorrow, argues that in its discipline it is more serious than most. The very point of the subject is to get information out to teachers and practitioners, it argues. How are they going to be able to do that if the serious research departments are out of the reach of huge swaths of the UK? As a result of the RAE, four-fifths of initial teacher training now takes place in universities or colleges where the department has no core research funding. It is seriously concerned that areas of the country may eventually have nowhere where training or serving teachers can work with active researchers. This affects education disproportionately because teachers wanting to extend their education through research are locally based. If the nearest centre of excellence is far away, they may have a problem in extending their education in the way the government is urging them to. \"The actual raw amount of money supporting educational research is about the same as it was but it has been heavily concentrated in a few departments,\" says John Furlong, president of Bera and director of educational studies at Oxford University. \"That's good for some ... but it does have consequences for the management of the whole system. We are not against centres of excellence but you also need a research community across the country which has contact with teaching practitioners across a range of institutions. Unless you have some kind of research capacity you will never get a research-based culture in schools.\" New universities that were building up their research teams were particularly damaged. Furlong cites Brighton University, which is \"doing some really excellent work\" on pupil grouping, but is relying on funding from the Economic and Social Research Council, and the lack of protection for research into ethnic diversity at London Metropolitan University. He estimates that about 20% of the best education research is being carried out in departments with RAE grades of 3 or below. Furlong met Barry Sheerman, chair of the education and skills select committee, to press his case last week. Almost immediately, Sheerman raised the issue in education questions in the Commons, and his committee is going to hold a seminar later this year with Bera. He has also promised to raise it with the new higher education minister, Kim Howells, when he first meets him. (Furlong tried and failed with his predecessor, Alan Johnson.) \"If you didn't have high-quality research work in education in each region that would be of very grave concern,\" Sheerman says. He has argued before against the greater concentration of funding. A senior academic in one highly rated university education department, which received a 5 in the last RAE, says: \"If we'd have got a 4 it would have cost us up to \u00a310m in research funds in the years leading up to the next one in 2007/8. This is money you need for underwriting research. With core funding you know it's there. With applications for research grants, it can take you up to six months to assemble an application for a grant and if you then are unsuccessful, you've just lost six month' work.\" Research on work-based learning, teacher supply and retention and learner-managed learning - all areas the government is keen to promote -have been caught up in the funding debacle. Although the departments can seek funds from elsewhere - charities, research councils and industry, for example - the lack of a high ranking in the RAE makes them less likely to be successful in their applications because their research base has been affected. So centres of excellence develop, but at the expense of shrinking the research base across the country. According to Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Employment and Education Research at the University of Buckingham, the research of education researchers is more difficult to assess than, for example, a subject such as physics, where science researchers will have followed a recognised research path within academe or industry. \"There's a science community and in that context peer review works very well,\" he says. \"With education, people come to it from all sorts of backgrounds and they have all sorts of different versions as to what can be held to be true and what can't. There is no clear set of criteria for determining what can be said to be good and less good and there aren't generally acknowledged judges of what can be said to be good and less good. \"The RAE doesn't really work well when it comes to education. The point of education research is to make education happen better. It has to provide good information to people who shape education, the policy-makers, and those who actually practise it. It is actually a practical subject, it's not a subject like chemistry or history, its justification is in its practice. That doesn't come out very strongly in the RAE ratings. \"Journals make sense in the sciences because you are making very careful measurements, you need to put them on record, they may well be of use 50 or 100 years down the line. Journals actually make little sense when it comes to education because it is a fast-changing scene, it is important to get the information out to the policy-makers and the teachers, not lodge it in the academic journals.\" Many believe the quality of both initial teacher training and continuing professional development is at risk because of the cutbacks in research funding. Stephen Court, senior researcher for the Association of University Teachers, goes further. He believes that, eventually, the reduction in the research base could affect the quality of what is going on in the classroom. \"There is a particular irony that we have a government policy supporting 'education, education, education' that has a system in place that has hit education research departments hardest. This, in turn, could affect provision in the classroom by cutting the link between research and teacher training.\" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education and Skills said: \"The overall quality of education research is improving. Between the 1996 and 2001 RAE, the percentage of departments rated 5 and 5* increased from 11% to 17% and the percentage of departments rated 4 increased from 17% to 23%. \"Education remains a priority for the government and it is important that it is underpinned by evidence. We welcome the contribution that universities and educationalists make to our determination to improve and provide a high-quality education for all.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
