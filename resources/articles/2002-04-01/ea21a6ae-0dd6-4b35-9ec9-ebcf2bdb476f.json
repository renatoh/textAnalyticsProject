The pair's riotous display had this match won by the half-hour; with a game in hand and a doddle of a run-in compared with Ipswich's, survival is within their grasp \"We began in a precarious position and ended nervously but psychologically it is obvious how important that win is for us,\" said the manager Graeme Souness. \"Damien came back last week with flu and hasn't been able to train, while Matt's got a hernia problem but played the best game of football I've seen from him. Given the circumstances, they were outstanding.\" Against ponderous opponents Blackburn's all-action, adrenalin-pumped approach deserved reward and got it. Duff returned from international duty with the Republic of Ireland last week with energy sapped and rumours abounding that he might be on his way should Rovers slip back into the Nationwide League. Liverpool are apparently keen; on this evidence Blackburn will do well to keep him Duff had already fizzed one centre across a cluttered six-yard box, the ball zipping through Paul Williams's legs without a touch, when he opted to go alone after 28 minutes. He cut in from the left, out-sprinted the floundering Paul Telfer and skimmed an irresistible shot into the bottom corner from 20 yards The home side may have beaten only Ipswich of the bottom six but this was the third consecutive home match in which Duff has scored - and all have been won Within a minute the advantage was doubled and the game settled. Jansen ducked away from a posse of visiting players, the ball seemingly glued to his instep, before finding the Irishman, who picked out Yordi. The Spaniard had needed nine stitches in a head wound suffered at Leicester on Saturday but he rose effortlessly above the back-pedalling Williams to nod his first goal for the club \"People will look at how clever and cute Matt was with that piece of skill in the build-up but his work-rate was superb throughout,\" added Souness of the former England Under-21 international. \"Forget the trick for the second goal and look at his overall display. He was immense and showed where he wants to be playing next season.\" With this win spurring them on, that should be in the top flight. Keith Gillespie, charging merrily down the right flank to complement Duff, gave Wayne Bridge a torrid time - worryingly for England - though the full-back did recover to clear a close-range attempt from Jansen off the line Southampton enjoyed plenty of possession but remained alarmingly toothless up front. Any chances gleaned were missed: Telfer fizzed one snap shot over the bar from Craig Short's weak headed clearance and Kevin Davies, once an expensive Rovers misfit and roundly booed throughout, miscontrolled as he bore down on Brad Friedel. The best they managed was Brett Ormerod's shot prodded wide from Jo Tessem's centre \"We did some nice things but the Premiership's not about being nice,\" said Gordon Strachan. \"The performance looked as if they were more desperate for the points but really it was just a case of their good players being better than our influential players. Our displays will get better and what will be will be.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
