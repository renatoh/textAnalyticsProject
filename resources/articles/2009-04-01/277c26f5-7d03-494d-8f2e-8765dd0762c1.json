He was also a pioneering research scientist, known nationally and internationally for his computer development work as a senior scientific officer at the National Physical Laboratory, just round the corner from where he lived. In the locality he was known for his Methodist convictions, his devotion to his handicapped wife Marjorie, his love of music (he was the organist at his local church), and support for many good causes. At the laboratory, he contributed to the progress of the technology which led to the invention of the world wide web. His early work promoted the development of magnetic tape systems, making it possible, for example, to translate scientific text from Russian to English. In 1970 Wyn and his research team were consulted by Reuters on the design of their global financial information network. He also advanced research on systems that aided deaf people, the subtitling of television programmes, translating mechanical shorthand into plain English, and advising banks on strengthened security. Having done well at Holywell county school, Flintshire, Wyn read electrical engineering at Liverpool University, gaining a first class honours degree in 1951. He stayed on to do postgraduate research and became doctor of philosophy. In 1986 Liverpool conferred a second doctorate on him. In later life he developed Parkinson's disease, so he and Marjorie moved into a local care home, where they were surrounded by CDs and books in Welsh or about Wales. Wyn also played the keyboard when two other residents got married. Marjorie predeceased him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
