The documents shine a light on the ways corporations have used their money to buy influence, amass prestige and shape public policy through grants to academic programmes and advocacy groups. The documents come to light as ExxonMobil, formed when Mobil merged with Exxon in 1999, is now facing investigations by multiple state attorneys general over claims it failed to communicate known climate crisis-related risks to investors and the public. The documents, dated in 1993 and provided to the Guardian by the Climate Investigations Center, show the Mobil Foundation justified spending by detailing major \u201cbenefits to Mobil\u201d they expected in return for more than 80 proposed grants for 1994 \u2013 a practice not-for-profit experts said may have violated federal law. The foundation wrote that its grants for not-for-profits could help Mobil fight environmental regulation, fund scientists whose work had been \u201cfavorably received by the industry\u201d and prepare Mobil to defend itself against lawsuits following oil spills and industrial accidents. For example, in a one-page entry listing past Mobil grants, the company was successful in \u201chaving the National Safety Council Board of Directors pass a resolution opposing the mandating of any alternative fuel\u201d, the foundation wrote. Grants for the council totalled nearly a quarter-million dollars, according to the entry, which recommended further grants for the coming year. The internal grant-making recommendations and records, many marked confidential, cover $1.2m worth of funding \u2013 about 10% of the foundation\u2019s annual budget. More than two-thirds of the roughly 120 full-page grant recommendations predict specific benefits for the oil giant. Justifications for offering money to not-for-profits and universities included: \u201cGlobal warming is likely to be the key international environmental issue of the 1990s,\u201d the foundation\u2019s internal records predicted in 1993, adding that climate regulation was \u201ca real possibility within the next five years\u201d. The foundation recommended a $25,000 grant to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University to help Mobil \u201cdevelop personal relationships with some of the key experts on this issue\u201d and enable Mobil to \u201cparticipate in the debate on these regulations\u201d. The Mobil Foundation recommended contributing a total of $25,000 to the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, saying the center had already effectively argued against tighter fuel economy standards and influenced America\u2019s toxic air pollution laws, and its stances may help keep Mobil\u2019s costs down in future. \u201cMobil\u2019s environmental expenditures exceeded $1bn in 1992,\u201d the document said. \u201cWithout a greater appreciation of scientific risk analysis, those costs will continue to escalate as environmental rules and programs are made excessively stringent in response to the public\u2019s unfounded panic over relatively minor incidents.\u201d The Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia describes its Environmental Associates Program as \u201ca group of corporate executives concerned about environmental effects of industrial activities\u201d. The program was founded by Dr Ruth Patrick, who helped to draft the Clean Water Act, a major federal law giving the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) power to write rules to protect people against harm from water pollution. \u201cBased on the contacts of the Academy,\u201d the Mobil Foundation wrote, \u201cthe Environmental Associates Program has the potential to challenge the EPA behind the scenes on the effectiveness of a regulation for the environment and whether sound science supports the proposed law.\u201d The Mobil Foundation recommended offering the National Research Council, part of the National Academies, funding for a study of an oil spill clean-up method, writing: \u201cBy helping to fund the study, Mobil may be offered the opportunity to participate or to receive early access to the findings.\u201d Leaders of Mobil and its foundation had offered public hints that they expected to harvest benefits from the company\u2019s charitable giving. \u201cShould corporations ever engage in pure philanthropy, giving money away because it gives one a nice feeling and the shareholders don\u2019t seem to mind?\u201d Herbert Schmertz, Mobil\u2019s vice-president of public affairs for about two decades and a former Mobil Foundation president, asked during a 22 September 1987 talk on philanthropy and corporate social responsibility. \u201cI guess I\u2019d answer that by saying I don\u2019t know whether corporate philanthropy as I\u2019ve sort of defined it, which is just to get a warm feeling, ever existed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it did, I\u2019d have to say that it\u2019s a dying concept in terms of corporate giving.\u201d A 1998 book thanking Richard Mund, who served as Mobil Foundation\u2019s executive director from 1979 to 2000, for his edits offers a similar view of corporate grant-making, advising that companies \u201cidentify a significant business reason\u201d for grants and \u201cobtain as much business value from social investments as is allowable and practical\u201d. Tax experts told the Guardian that the Mobil Foundation\u2019s stated intent to benefit Mobil through \u201ccharitable\u201d grants would have raised serious red flags for illegal self-dealing, had it come to light before the statute of limitations ran out. \u201cThe public would have a very hard time finding out any of this,\u201d said Naomi Oreskes, author of Merchants of Doubt and a Harvard University professor of the history of science, adding that \u201ctypically one can only see the organization and amount, but no details of what or why\u201d. \u201cWhat I see here is a pattern of \u2018charitable giving\u2019 that is anything but disinterested,\u201d she said. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said: \u201cOur philanthropic arm follows all laws and required disclosures. The ExxonMobil Foundation has a strategic focus supporting education with an emphasis on math and science, promoting women as catalysts for economic development and preventing deaths from malaria.\u201d A lawsuit filed in October by the New York attorney general alleges ExxonMobil defrauded investors for years about the risks climate crisis regulation posed for the fossil fuel giant. In January, the US supreme court allowed Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey\u2019s investigation into how ExxonMobil described climate crisis risks to consumers and investors to move forward by refusing to hear the company\u2019s appeal. A spokesperson for Healey declined to comment on the newly revealed documents, citing ongoing litigation. The ExxonMobil Foundation was also formed after the 1999 merger of Exxon and Mobil. Corporate watchdogs said issues associated with private industry\u2019s use of not-for-profits to influence American policy have become more pronounced since the 1990s, particularly in the wake of the supreme court\u2019s Citizens United decision, which protected political spending by corporations and which critics say fuelled a rapid expansion of so-called \u201cdark money\u201d advocacy groups whose funding is more difficult to trace. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely troubling,\u201d Lisa Graves, president of the board of the Center for Media and Democracy, said. \u201cOne of the primary rules for nonprofits is that they\u2019re supposed to be in the public interest,\u201d she said, \u201cnot for private benefits.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
