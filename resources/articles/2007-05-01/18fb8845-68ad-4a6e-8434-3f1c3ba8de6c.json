MF Husain", "bodyText": "India will celebrate 60 years of independence this August. It is also rejoicing in recently joining the club of the world's fastest-growing big economies. Yet, for all its grown-up success, the subcontinent can occasionally display a very childish petulance. It is in the middle of one of these hissy fits at the moment, over a painting by Maqbool Fida Husain. MF Husain is probably the most renowned living Indian artist. He is 91. And he has stirred up a national storm over a painting depicting India as a nude goddess. The picture, called Bharat Mata (Mother India), has prompted legal proceedings to be lodged against Mr Husain, largely by rightwing Hindu groups who complain that it is obscene and an insult to their faith. It is certainly crude and the Muslim artist has apologised. Still the controversy drones on. Mr Husain, who with his granny glasses and white mane of hair resembles John Lennon had he stayed on in that ashram, has been in hot water before. His pictures, often deliberately basic in the Indian folk style, fit into national tradition. And in a society that venerates age, there is a tradition of the awkward oldie. Khushwant Singh is another nonagenerian grandee yet publishes memoirs of sexual conquests. There are rather higher stakes in Mr Husain's case. In a country with some 140 million Muslims, it is important that Hindu nationalist groups do not decide what is acceptable. Whatever India's recent achievements, among its greatest is holding on to the secular status enshrined in its constitution."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
