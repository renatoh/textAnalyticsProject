Tomorrow, when he faces parliament for the first time since March, the list will be longer than usual. Nine soldiers have died in the past month, eight of them in Iraq. Like 134 others killed in the conflict, they are victims of a military campaign that may end without a ministerial apology, or any proper acceptance of error. Parliament has been complicit in this avoidance of responsibility. Many MPs, in both main parties, who backed the war in 2003, have been unable or reluctant to confront the reality of what has happened in Iraq. Others have felt themselves constrained by ongoing military operations. Calls for an inquiry have, in the main, been limited to demands for an investigation when troops come home. Yet the opposition felt no such restraint yesterday when it confronted the defence secretary, Des Browne, over the narrower issue of the Iran hostage fiasco. The strategy that left 15 sailors and marines floating in contested waters near Iran, and the nature of their training and equipment, need investigation. But scenting political gain, the Conservative party's challenge has focused on the media handling of their return to Britain. This simply underlines the inadequate way in which the government has been held to account over the far greater catastrophe of Iraq. It goes without saying that the decision to allow the captured 15 to sell their stories was jaw-droppingly inept. It has harmed the reputation of British forces around the world, should never have been made and should certainly not have been signed off by Mr Browne when it came to him during a long Easter weekend spent campaigning in Scotland. But all this was already known before yesterday's statement, which saw a chastened Mr Browne throw himself repeatedly on the mercy of the Commons. He looked and sounded like a man in trouble. He did what he should have done from the start and admitted that he had made a bad mistake. His halting apology stood in contrast to the sub-Churchillian bombast sprayed about by the shadow defence secretary, Liam Fox. Mr Fox's attack reeked of opposition opportunism, full of questions to answer and pantomime outrage. Attacking Iran's \"pariah regime\" he appeared to regret that the marines had not fought and widened the conflict in the Gulf. Mr Browne's statement could not excuse a lamentable episode. Nor did it answer serious points: about the loss of communication with HMS Cornwall, the lack of air cover and the nature of the post-capture training Mr Browne said 14 of the 15 had received. The two inquiries he announced will buy him political time. Their findings, if any, may be overlooked amid Labour's leadership contest. But of all defence secretaries since 1997, Mr Browne has at least responded to the pressure on Britain's armed forces after almost a decade of large-scale military operations. He cannot match his predecessor John Reid as a performer, in parliament or with troops. But he has secured new equipment and improved pay, and coped with discontent among the military high command. The navy, whose poor performance made the Iran episode possible, is about to be landed with costly new Trident submarines and giant aircraft carriers of dubious value, but can no longer carry out basic functions reliably. Parts of the military are in a terrible state, underfunded and ill-equipped. The timetable for British withdrawal from Basra appears to be drifting. All this can exact a cost in lives and offers legitimate ground on which Mr Browne should be challenged. Why two young sailors sold their stories, and who allowed it, is a lesser issue. Parliament and the opposition should find the nerve to ask bigger questions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
