A once-in-a-lifetime experience. Only the weather can come between thousands of onlookers and one of nature's most spectacular sights. As astronomers, TV crews, tourists and the odd pagan make their long way to the wild northernmost coast of Scotland and the northern isles for this weekend's annular eclipse they are hoping that one natural phenomenon does not obscure the other. Their unifying hope is that the first annular eclipse in Britain for more than 80 years does not fall victim to the kind of typically British summer skies that thwarted Cornwall's party for the solar eclipse in 1999. If the clouds stay away observers will be treated to an incredible view at 4.24am on Saturday. As the moon passes between the earth and the sun its shadow will block out the sun, leaving only a fiery ring, or annulus, in the sky. \"It will be an incredible sight,\" said Sir Patrick Moore, who plans to be there with a TV crew from the BBC. \"We just have to keep our fingers crossed that the weather is in our favour.\" Although annular eclipses are more rare than solar eclipses, the celebrations in remote northern Scotland will not be on quite the same scale as those seen for the solar eclipse in Cornwall. But an influx of tourists into one of the most sparsely populated parts of Britain is leading to a little local ingenuity. \"Accommodation is nearly all booked up by now,\" said Casia Zajac of the Highlands of Scotland tourist board. \"People are coming from all over the world and I know some of the locals are doing things like arranging caravans to sell tea and putting on boats to the best viewing spots.\" Mainland eclipse gazers are expected to gather along the northern coast of Scotland, in places such as Dunnet Head and John O'Groats, while on the northern isles viewing sites have been set up at Unst and Fetlar. Eclipse gazers are being advised to find an elevated spot near the sea with a clear view to the north-eastern horizon. Thus the rather unromantic spot of Durness car park, 80ft above the beach, looked likely to be a centre of activity. But met office forecasters yesterday predicted that in western areas - such as Durness - there may only be a poor chance of the clouds parting for the eclipse in the early hours of Saturday, saying: \"The best chances of seeing the eclipse will be in the east.\" There is, though, some hope for those who are making the journey to witness a natural phenomenon last seen in Britain in 1921, and which will not be seen again until 2093. Mid-range forecasts of Scotland's notoriously changeable summer weather are far from infallible, meaning eclipse watchers may still be lucky."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
