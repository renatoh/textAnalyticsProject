Instead, he puts them in a gentle spin, hangs them neatly out to dry, then carefully picks them off one by one. Yesterday he finished with a career-best unbeaten 262 - the highest score this season in all cricket - without ever making Glamorgan feel they were drowning in a sea of runs. They were, of course, but he is not the type to draw attention to it. Van Jaarsveld lists \"throw-downs\" as one of his relaxations, which is just as well: as Glamorgan toiled on a Sophia Gardens belter, the impression was of one long, remorseless net session. \"There wasn't too much flash about it,\" he said. \"I was just trying to grind it out and spend time at the crease.\" This was an innings in his own image: quiet, thoughtful, unflappable. He hit only one four as he moved from 200 to 250 in 100 balls - the slowest of his half-centuries - and in all faced 439 balls. He is now the leading runscorer in this season's championship, with 796 at an average of 66. Van Jaarsveld, who turns 31 next week, has sacrificed an international career with South Africa - he won the last of his nine Test caps against England in Durban in December - to play for Kent under the Kolpak banner. He even says that shedding the tag of overseas player has helped his game. \"Last year at Northants everyone expected me to do well because of the overseas brand,\" he said. \"Maybe that does add a bit of pressure.\" Four centuries in 13 innings this season, compared with one in 13 with Northamptonshire, suggests he has a point. Resuming on 174, he left the hits and giggles to his colleagues. Min Patel slugged his way to 87 off 114 balls also a career best, in a stand of 159, a Kent record for the eighth wicket against any county. Then Martin Saggers bashed 45 out of a last-wicket partnership of 77 to lift them to 568, their highest total in this fixture. Glamorgan lacked penetration again, and their wickets have now cost 54 runs each this season. Relegation is already tapping them on the shoulder. When they were allowed their turn at the crease they lost Daniel Cherry on the drive, Matt Elliott to a comedy run out and Michael Powell, who played outside a beauty from Amjad Khan that clipped the top of off stump. David Hemp and Sourav Ganguly hit fifties, but a sixth defeat in seven looms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
