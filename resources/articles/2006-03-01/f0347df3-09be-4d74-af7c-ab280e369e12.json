The Home Office will send out new guidelines to newsagents next week asking them to display the magazines out of the sight and reach of children. The move follows a meeting between Home Office officials and members of the National Federation of Retail Newsagents (NFRN) after MPs and campaigners complained about the increasingly explicit sexual content of lads' mags. The guidelines do not name specific magazines but are believed to be aimed at titles such as Nuts, Zoo and Loaded being moved. They also state that while tabloid titles can remain on the bottom shelf they should be folded or overlapped with others if a front page is sexually explicit. Alternatively the newspapers could be placed upside down displaying their back-page story. The NFRN trade relations manager, David Daniel, said: \"We were quite happy to extend the guidance that already have about top shelf titles. We are saying they should not be displayed at children's eye level or below. Nor should they be placed near children's titles. A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"We are aware of concern that has been expressed about sexually provocative material which is commonly available on newsagents lower shelves. \"We are determined to ensure that the interests of children are appropriately safeguarded in this regard.\" Officials from the Home Office met NFRN representatives and other trade associations earlier this month. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
