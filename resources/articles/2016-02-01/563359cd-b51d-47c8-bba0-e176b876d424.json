Football Federation mirrored the punishment meted out last week to Western Sydney Wanderers after a section of Victory fans disrupted Saturday night\u2019s match against cross-town rivals City by igniting flares and throwing bottles onto the AAMI Park pitch. There was also an alleged assault on TV news personnel outside the stadium and altercations with police after the match. Victory, who after the 2-2 draw in the derby finished the weekend in fifth place on the ladder \u2013 on the same number of points as City and six off pacesetters Brisbane Roar \u2013 have been fined $50,000 and hit with a three-point deduction, suspended for 12 months. The points deduction will be triggered should another \u201cserious incident\u201d involving Victory fans occur before 13 February 2017. As with the punishment delivered to Western Sydney, FFA said it took into consideration Victory\u2019s response to Monday\u2019s show cause notice, in which the club made clear its commitment to review and enhance safety and security measures. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Victory chairman Anthony Di Pietro said on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a line in the sand moment ... when we ask the true Melbourne Victory fans to stand with us. Together we must ensure that anti-social behaviour from a marginal element does not compromise everything that we\u2019re trying to achieve. \u201cOur message is simple. No more flares. No more anti-social behaviour.\u201d Wanderers were punished after their fans set off 25 flares and detonators in a match against Victory the previous weekend. During that match, Victory fans also ripped at least one flare. \u201cThe behaviour of a number of Melbourne Victory supporters last Saturday night was deplorable and cast a shadow over what was a fabulous game of A-League football,\u201d said FFA boss David Gallop. \u201cIt\u2019s staggering that these dangerous incidents happened just days after FFA had applied sanctions to the Western Sydney Wanderers because of the actions of some fans. The focus on fan behaviour could not have been more acute. \u201cIf there is any bright note in this situation, it is the refreshing attitude shown by both clubs through their CEOs, coaches and players. They are saying \u2018enough is enough\u2019. As leaders and ambassadors of their clubs, they want to be part of the solution.\u201d Victory play Adelaide United on Friday at Etihad Stadium while Wanderers play local rivals Sydney FC at Allianz Stadium on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
