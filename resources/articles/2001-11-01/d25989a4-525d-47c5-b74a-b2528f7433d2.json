Traces of the disease were found at two post boxes rented at the office in an underground shopping complex over the weekend. The post office was immediately decontaminated and no more positive samples were found. CNN reported that six employees who work at the branch have been put on Cipro, an antibiotic used to treat anthrax, as a precaution. The post office does not process mail for the Pentagon but recieves receive mail from the Brentwood sorting office in Washington. Two employees in that facility -which also processed an anthrax-laden letter sent to the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle - died of inhalation anthrax and two others are in hospital. In other developments, a videotape that the NBC television network sent to the New York mayor's office was found to be contaminated with small traces of anthrax. The New York mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, said there was no evidence that anyone at City Hall was infected by the package. Sent from the office of NBC anchor Tom Brokaw, it contained footage of a White House briefing on September 18 in which a Giuliani aide was mentioned. Health officials said that the tape was linked to an anthrax-laced letter sent to NBC on September 18 from Trenton, New Jersey. \"We feel pretty confident that it was cross-contaminated,\" said a New York health department spokeswoman. \"This is not a new contamination.\" Also in New York, health investigators renewed their search for clues to explain how a woman with no postal connection died after contracting inhalation anthrax. Early anthrax tests at Kathy Nguyen's Bronx apartment and at the hospital where she worked were negative. Centre for Disease Control investigators are widening their search to include other places where she might have contracted the disease. \"Every possible lead is being followed,\" said the CDC director, Dr Jeffrey Koplan. He said the investigation was difficult because Nguyen lived alone. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the lack of a known postal connection suggests that Nguyen may have got the disease in a different manner. He said it was possible hers was a \"sentinel case in a new and evolving pattern\" but if that were true there should have been similar cases by now. Healthcare workers at the Atlanta-based CDC have been vaccinated against smallpox, as a precaution to protect medical personnel who would be the first to respond to any outbreak of the disease. There are no plans to vaccinate all Americans but four drug companies are studying ways to manufacture new smallpox vaccines and build up the national stockpile to about 300m doses, enough for each person. Since the anthrax crisis began last month, 10 Americans have developed inhaled anthrax, the most serious form of the disease. Nguyen was the fourth to die."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
