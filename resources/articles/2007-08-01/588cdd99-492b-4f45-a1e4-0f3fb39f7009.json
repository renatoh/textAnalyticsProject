It would provide the boost it needs in terms of spicing up the competitiveness. It is still the premier cup competition in the world and it has not been hit as hard as the League Cup, where even Championship sides are fielding fringe players. But it still seems that not all of the big clubs are treating it as seriously as they used to. That would change if the final Champions League place went to the FA Cup winner rather than the team that finished fourth in the Premier League. Whatever they might hope for during the season, none of the bigger clubs could guarantee they would finish in the three places available. They might well rotate their squad less readily and we would see more of the leading players on display in the FA Cup. I am not arguing that things would change for the likes of Steve Coppell at Reading, who pursued a policy of putting out a fringe side on the basis that his priority had to be survival in the Premier League. That would still be the case. But other ambitious mid-table clubs, like Blackburn, Everton, Aston Villa and Newcastle, would have mixed feelings. It might well be that they consider their best chance of competing with the top four would be in the FA Cup and would reconsider their priorities. I understand when you hear the likes of Sir Alex Ferguson arguing that you cannot judge the worth of a side that can win the FA Cup by putting a run of only six games together - that is exactly what my chairman said to me at the start of the season when we won it at Everton. I am not for one minute suggesting that Sir Alex's arguments are not valid. This is one of those issues where there will always be reasonable cases both for and against. But in my opinion, if the argument comes down to who deserves to qualify for the Champions League, then you have to remember it is not strictly a league of champions anyway: that is a misnomer. It is full of non-champions. At least if the FA Cup winner qualified, there would be another team in the Champions League who had won something . You can qualify from as low down as fourth in the Premier League and, as we have seen, that means a club can finish more than 20 points behind the champions but still go into the qualifying stages. Dismissing this change in qualification should not come down to how you think a team will go on to perform in the Champions League. In recent years both Arsenal and Liverpool have reached the final and Liverpool won in 2005. They did not finish top of the Premier League, yet clearly they deserved their place in the competition. No suggests Blackburn Rovers' chairman, John Williams On balance I do not think this particular measure will achieve the result Uefa hopes. In practical terms history tells us that the top four teams not only tend to win the FA Cup, they are also the ones competing against each other in the final. It is more than 10 years since a team that has finished outside of the top four has won the FA Cup. This would suggest that making a place available to the winner will not necessarily change the make-up of the sides competing in the Champions League, rather it may well be the case that you have the same top four as you would if nothing had been changed in qualification. Last season we came as close as anyone to making it through but Chelsea still prevailed in the semi-final. In three years we have reached three semi-finals, one in the Carling Cup, and lost to Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea. It is no easier to beat those clubs in a knockout competition. I would suggest, therefore, that the reality, as opposed to the sentiment, of Michel Platini's plan is that, if it ever got off the ground, it might not make that much difference. I also think there is a question to be raised over what happens if the FA Cup winners have finished in the top three of the league. Does their place in Europe then go to the losing finalist? Or is it handed to the side that finishes fourth, thereby changing nothing? These are issues that must be considered before any proposal can be brought in. I believe very strongly in meritocracy. The Champions League may no longer be contested simply by the champions of each country but it is still meritocratic when it is a case of the top four qualifying. The places are taken by those clubs who, as a result of going out to fight over 38 games of a season, have finished above everyone else in the division. Why should they not receive their reward for that hard work? However, I do not like the fact that the league is as predictable as it is and we have a situation where Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal will always fi nish ahead of the rest. I would dearly love to see a change in the composition of the top four and for there to be other English clubs participating in the Champions League; I just do not think this proposal is the way to achieve that. A better way of ensuring greater competition in terms of who qualifies is to look at how we can ensure other teams can break into the top four. My old-fashioned view on meritocracy has to be set against the fact that we do not have a level playing field to start with. We need to look at how we can prevent the league being a procession year after year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
