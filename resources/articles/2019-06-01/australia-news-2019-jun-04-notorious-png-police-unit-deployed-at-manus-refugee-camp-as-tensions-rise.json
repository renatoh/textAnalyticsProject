Manus provincial police commander, David Yapu, told Guardian Australia on Monday the mobile squad \u2013 whose members have been accused of rapes, murders and other serious human rights abuses \u2013 had been dispatched in the wake of escalating tensions following the re-election of Australia\u2019s Coalition government last month. \u201cBecause of the current situation with a number of attempted suicides in a short period of time we have updated our operations plan to focus on those camps,\u201d Yapu said. \u201cMeaning their presence at day and night will now be at those camps that the refugees are living in. \u201cJust to reduce [the self-harm and suicide attempts]. Because \u2026 once they see police then things go back normal. Although we have the contracted security Paladin, they will continue unless they see policeman wearing a uniform at the camp. That will change that.\u201d The election has sparked a mental health crisis among refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island. Last week Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz Adam said at least 31 men had tried to commit suicide since the 18 May election. Guardian Australia understands there was another suicide attempt in the early hours of Monday morning. The crisis is reportedly affecting local health services. Despite the Australian government paying $21.5m to a company known as Pacific International Hospital (PIH) to provide healthcare for refugees on the island, those on Manus have told Guardian Australia that the local hospital, Lorengau general hospital, has been handling many of the self-harm and suicide cases. The PIH-operated transit centre clinic in Lorengau employs 13 healthcare professionals including three medical officers, three nurses, one paramedic, an after-hours GP and one after-hours nurse. The five mental health workers include just one psychiatrist. But Yapu confirmed to Guardian Australia that in serious cases patients were often initially sent to Lorengau. \u201cSometimes they rush them to Lorengau general hospital and after that, maybe they say no and refer [them] back to PIH,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in most cases because of the critical situation they are in they are rushed to Lorengau. That is the situation they are currently facing.\u201d The former Manus Island MP Ronnie Knight has accused PIH of referring patients to Lorengau general and criticised the company and the Australian government for using local PNG resources. \u201cWhy do local staff on minimum wages have to use precious resources on people who are harming themselves while the contractor PIH is paid millions and acts as a referral service,\u201d Knight told SBS. \u201cThe main anger from my people is simply that in our culture if you are responsible for such people you must care for them.\u201d While self-harm and suicide attempts have occurred regularly throughout the offshore detention period, those on Manus say there is an increased sense of desperation and hopelessness among the island\u2019s refugee population. It has also prompted heightened tensions on the island. In a Facebook post responding to an article about the increased mental health crisis on the island last week, Yapu wrote: \u201cWhat more can our police officers do.\u201d \u201cAttempts suicides, self-harm are beyond our control and part of system of depression related to long-term offshore detention, unknown future and families living away from them and result to severe mental illness.\u201d \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.
