But the work of BBC Monitoring at Caversham Park remains as relevant today as it was at the height of the cold war. An internet connection gives anyone the opportunity to monitor open sources of information around the world. But few would have the time, the languages or the knowledge to separate the wheat from the chaff in the press, TV and radio reports from 150 countries in more than 100 languages. That priceless asset is contained not only in an old stately home outside Reading, but in monitoring stations in Kenya, Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Serbia and Egypt. Unhappily, BBC Monitoring is being eyed by the Cabinet Office, which provides \u00a325m out of its \u00a328.8m income, as a prime target for a cut, something that its director, Chris Westcott, told employees recently could prove to be a tipping point. It would be supreme folly to attempt to withdraw from Afghanistan, or negotiate with Iran, while depriving ourselves of a proven ability to listen to official Afghan and Iranian sources. The same goes for many other parts of the world. Open source monitoring has been resilient in adapting to the internet. It has proved itself in two reviews in the past 15 years. The danger now is an attack of collective amnesia. BBC Monitoring is a vital resource, which should be kept."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
