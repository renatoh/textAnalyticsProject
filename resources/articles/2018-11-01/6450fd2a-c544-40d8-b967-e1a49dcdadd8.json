Kosovo-born Shaqiri was left behind when the Liverpool squad flew to Serbia on Monday with his manager seeking to avoid controversy around the tie. Klopp admitted politics influenced his decision; the Switzerland international incensed Serbia after his 90th- minute winner against them at the World Cup. Shaqiri was fined 10,000 Swiss francs by Fifa for celebrating by forming a double-headed eagle with his hands \u2013 as represented on the flag of Albania, who fought against Serbia in the Kosovo war \u2013 and sparked a complaint from the Serbia FA for sporting a Kosovo flag on his boots. Klopp\u2019s decision has been welcomed by Serbian media and Red Star officials who believe it has defused a potentially volatile situation and the threat of Uefa sanctions. Red Star\u2019s sporting director, Zvezdan Terzic, cautioned against Shaqiri playing when the draw was made, but Liverpool\u2019s manager insists there was nothing sinister behind his selection. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely not aware of any security issues,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cThe only thing I can say about it was that it was common sense. It was common sense to make the decision and not to force anything. We come here wanting to play football. We have to concentrate on football. We have to focus on football. That\u2019s what we want to do and that is why I made that decision.\u201d Shaqiri said after Liverpool\u2019s 4-0 defeat of Red Star at Anfield last month that he wanted to play in the return game and could \u201chandle it, no problem\u201d. His reaction when told that would not be the case, Klopp said, was: \u201c\u2018OK, boss.\u2019 That was the decision and with the decision the discussion ended at that moment.\u201d The Liverpool manager was taken aback by the focus on Shaqiri\u2019s omission, something he thought would be avoided once his squad was announced. \u201cMy job and your job as well is not to do questions which provoke a kind of answer,\u201d said Klopp, who asked the Serbian interpreter to ensure this answer about the political nature of his decision was translated 100% accurately. \u201cWe need to cool the situation down. We are in Serbia, we respect that 100%. That\u2019s how the world is. Politics always has influence on life, on the life I live at least, and that\u2019s how it is. But we are not here for that, we are here to play football. We tried to make sure we can be focused on football. I expected it differently but most of the English-speaking journalists were asking about it, to be honest. \u201cIt could have been a story but we didn\u2019t want to have a story besides a football story. That\u2019s why we decided what we decided.\u201d Klopp admits a priority for Liverpool in Belgrade \u2013 irrespective of the Shaqiri situation \u2013 will be to silence a stadium known as the \u201cMarakana\u201d and renowned for its intimidating atmosphere. Liverpool beat Red Star comfortably last month but the Serbian champions have not lost at home for over a year. The defender Andy Robertson said: \u201cAt Anfield we scored at the right times and we\u2019re at 100%. I think they\u2019re a different beast when they\u2019re at home. I think they proved that against Napoli, getting the draw. They\u2019ll be hoping to use that to their advantage and hopefully we\u2019ll quieten the crowd.\u201d Naby Ke\u00efta has travelled having missed Liverpool\u2019s last four games with a hamstring injury. Jordan Henderson remains sidelined with the same problem but is expected to resume full training with the squad later this week. Klopp views the game against Red Star as an opportunity to take control of a tight group including Napoli and Paris Saint-Germain but knows Tuesday\u2019s opponents will be smarting from their heavy defeat at Anfield. \u201cIt would help massively,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we could win here it would give us a bit of control but only until the next game because everything is open again. Even if Paris loses, they can still get 10 points by winning the two games, and the last one is here. It is really important you focus on the job ahead of you because it is so difficult here, so different. I never played here but what I heard about it since I was growing up is that it is a very tough place, historically a tough place to go. They will try everything. \u201cIt is a very proud nation and a very proud club, losing 4-0 away, no supporters there, it\u2019s all a little bit in their favour with what they can use for motivation. They will shout like they usually shout in two games. The job for us is to cool that down with the football we play. It\u2019s a challenge. This is a proud football club and they want to strike back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
