The 30-year old Satala, who was banned for two months by the French Rugby Federation in 2000 after testing positive for cannabis, has won 25 caps and is currently competing in the Commonwealth Games. He follows the Australian Nathan Williams, the South African Andre Vos, the Argentinian Pablo Cardinalli and the Frenchman Laurent Gomez to the Stoop in the close season. \"Viliame is one of the best centres in world rugby,\" said Harlequins' chief executive Mark Evans. \"He will give us real depth in the midfield and if he repeats his form of the 1999 World Cup, he will become a firm favourite.\" The Quins' flanker Tu Tamarua this week signed for Swansea, while the club's forwards' coach, John Kingston, is recovering in hospital after a five-hour operation to remove a blood clot from his brain. Leicester made their fourth summer signing yesterday when they confirmed that the Hull wing Gareth Raynor would join them at the end of the Super League season in October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
