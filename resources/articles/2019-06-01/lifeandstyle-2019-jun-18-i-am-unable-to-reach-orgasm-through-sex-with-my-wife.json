I started masturbating at 14 and did so at least five times a week leading up to getting married. Through masturbating I could bring myself to orgasm within three minutes. However, through vaginal sex, it doesn\u2019t happen at all and she has to finish me with oral sex or a hand job. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on \u2013 whether it\u2019s in my head, or something else. We want kids eventually, but I\u2019m having issues reaching orgasm inside her. Please help me. You are far from the only person in the world who is having difficulty switching from self-pleasuring to partner sex. Sometimes this is because a man has become used to pretty firm or even rough stimulation; no vagina will be able to provide a similarly high-friction sensation. Your task is to find ways to bridge these two qualitatively different experiences, and to learn to resensitise yourself. Consider forgoing masturbation for a while and make some creative choices, allowing your wife to pleasure you manually or orally up to a certain point, then switching to intercourse at your \u201cpoint of no return\u201d. Expect to fail at this a few times, but if you ejaculate incrementally closer to her vagina, eventually you should be able to achieve it. And most importantly, try to let go of the notion that three minutes to ejaculation is a fine thing. Instead, take your time. Make pleasure (both yours and hers) rather than ejaculation the goal for you both. \u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. \u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments).
