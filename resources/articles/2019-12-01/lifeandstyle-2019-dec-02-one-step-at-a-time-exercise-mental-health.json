But if you can muster the energy, evidence shows that exercise has a powerfully beneficial effect. One 2019 study, published in JAMA Psychiatry, found that physical activity is an effective prevention strategy for depression. Another 2015 paper found that exercise can be as helpful in treating mild to moderate depression as antidepressants and psychotherapy. \u201cWe have known for a long time that exercise promotes physiological and neurochemical responses that make you feel good,\u201d says Prof Nanette Mutrie of the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Institute for Sport, Physical Education and Health Sciences. When we exercise, the brain releases endorphins, as well as dopamine and serotonin. \u201cVery often, these same chemicals form part of antidepressant drugs,\u201d she says. There is also a psychological component to exercise that makes us feel good, says Mutrie. \u201cWhen you\u2019re exercising, you are improving your self-esteem, mastering a new task and meeting new people. All of this forms part of the mix. There\u2019s this synergy of positive things that is happening.\u201d If you are struggling with your mental health and are anxious about exercise, the best advice is to start small. \u201cYour goals should be really achievable,\u201d advises Sarah Overall, a London-based personal trainer who is qualified to take referrals from the NHS. \u201cTake it slowly and be proud of every step you take.\u201d She also says you will have setbacks along the way and shouldn\u2019t feel discouraged. \u201cFitness isn\u2019t linear,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can go for a run one day and feel OK, and the next time feel rubbish.\u201d She suggests exercising with a trusted friend, so that you have someone to check in with if you are feeling anxious. Mutrie suggests a simple walking programme. \u201cAim to increase the amount you are walking over the course of a month. Start with walking for 10 minutes a day and gradually up it.\u201d Most smartphones now have pedometers, so you can track your steps: 7,000 steps a day is a good target to set yourself, with the aim of eventually increasing it to the government recommendation of 10,000 steps daily. Jermaine Johnson, another personal trainer who often trains clients with depression and anxiety, suggests avoiding cardio. \u201cThat can raise the heart rate and fuel your anxiety,\u201d he says. Instead, he suggests that you try strength training. \u201cI\u2019ve trained people with depression who\u2019ve said weightlifting made a big difference.\u201d Because you can measure your progress with weight training \u2013 heavier weights or more repetitions \u2013 you will be able to see how much you are improving, which could lift your mood. You don\u2019t have to exercise all the time. \u201cIf you want to optimise your exercise regime for your mental health, according to our research, exercising for 45 minutes at a time, three to five times a week, has the most beneficial mental health effects,\u201d says Dr Adam Chekroud of Yale School of Medicine. He is the co-author of one of the biggest studies into exercise and mental health, which looked at 1.2 million adults in the US. He says that cycling and team sports will give you the biggest boost, but even walking or doing household chores are better than nothing. It\u2019s a good idea to pick times when gyms are less busy, so you won\u2019t feel like you are being watched. \u201cSpeak to the gym manager and ask them about their quiet times and quiet areas,\u201d Overall says. If you\u2019re able to slip away from work, gyms are generally quiet in the mid-afternoon. Plus, you won\u2019t have to drag yourself out of bed at the crack of dawn. \u201cIf it\u2019s dark or rainy, it can be hard to get up early, especially if you\u2019re struggling with depression,\u201d she says. Just being in nature has also been shown to have beneficial mental health effects. \u201cYou need sunlight for vitamin D, and vitamin D lifts your mood,\u201d says Overall. Look for a Green Gym near you: these free, conservation-based workouts are a great way to meet people in your local area, if you\u2019re feeling lonely; sign up and you could be planting trees or sowing seeds alongside other participants. Beyond that, the mental health charity Mind has a directory of fitness classes and other outdoor activities on its website (mind.org.uk), many of which are free. If you feel up to being around other people, group exercise can help. \u201cWhen it comes to depression or stress, these conditions have a biological underpinning, but they also have social components,\u201d Chekroud says. The sense of community you feel as part of a sports team can have a brightening effect on your mood. \u201cIt takes the attention away from the individual person,\u201d says Johnson. And if you end up feeling overwhelmed or anxious in the class, it is fine to leave early. \u201cYou always have the option to leave. I\u2019ve had people who\u2019ve walked out of my classes,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d If you\u2019re feeling very anxious before a class, give the trainer a heads-up that you\u2019re not feeling great, and might slip out early \u2013 and pick a spot near the door for minimum fuss. Johnson recommends starting with a yoga or a barre class, rather than a circuits class, as often these involve partner-work, which can be difficult for those with social anxiety. Whatever you are doing, pick a beginner\u2019s class: now is not the time to throw yourself into Bikram yoga. \u201cIf a class is too intense, you\u2019re going to feel like you\u2019re doing badly, and you may end up feeling worse than you did when you arrived,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThat is definitely not the goal.\u201d Anyone struggling with body dysmorphia \u201cshould avoid gyms, as they are full of mirrors\u201d, says Overall. \u201cInstead, take things outside if you can.\u201d Try jogging or doing a high-intensity interval training workout in the park. If you are in recovery from an eating disorder, Overall recommends creating an exercise plan under the supervision of a mental health professional, to avoid overdoing it. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019s like an alcoholic going back in a pub. It\u2019s got to be carefully managed.\u201d If you don\u2019t feel as if you can leave your house, there are plenty of fitness videos online that you can do at home. Try Fitness Blender, or download the Nike app. If you can afford a personal trainer, look for one who has an exercise referral qualification, meaning they are accredited to work with the NHS. Explain your mental health challenges to them and have them tailor an appropriate programme; speak to your doctor to ensure your workout is medically safe. When you are exercising, it is absolutely fine to take a break, or stop entirely, if you are feeling overwhelmed. \u201cDon\u2019t feel like you have failed because you had to stop,\u201d says Overall. When you are struggling with your mental health, it is easy to get trapped in a spiral of negative thoughts and think that everyone in your gym is watching you. But they are almost certainly not, says Johnson. \u201cNinety per cent of the time, people aren\u2019t thinking about you \u2013 they\u2019re focusing on their own workout.\u201d Finally, the act of putting on a pair of trainers can, on its own, be a form of self-care. \u201cEven if you leave after a few minutes, you\u2019ve already achieved something just by going to the gym,\u201d says Johnson. Focus on the fact that you went to the gym in the first place, not that you left. And take everything one step at a time. You\u2019re in control."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
