Perhaps it's inevitable, then, that there is a real down feeling here this year. There are also suggestions that Venice is taking a hammering from Toronto, which starts just as Venice is winding up, and provides a soft landing for films looking to enter the US market. But actually, it's more likely that we are at a quietish moment in cinema's evolution. Apart from the Coen brothers, whose Burn After Reading opened the festival with a suitably hysterical dose of red-carpet razzle-dazzle (courtesy of Brad Pitt and George Clooney), the films have been solid rather than spectacular. Though many of the higher-brow critics were sniffy about Burn, it is a cracking comedy, its laughs laced with that creeping sense of menace the Coens do so well. It is also self-consciously throwaway, but that only adds to the fun. It is certainly a lot less portentous and self-important than Guillermo Arriaga's directorial debut, The Burning Plain, which was the only other film to get the paparazzi hot under the collar. Although The Burning Plain retains Arriaga's trademark time-shift jigsaw puzzle of a narrative, his directorial manner can best be described as plodding. Behind this surface flash, the rest of the Venice programme seemed like plain porridge without sugar, comprising the sort of names that make a splash at festivals without necessarily troubling the outside world too much. I made a mistake in opting to see the new Abbas Kiarostami film, Shirin, rather than the new Takeshi Kitano, Achilles and the Tortoise, but I still can't work out whether Shirin was fascinating or awful. Maybe it was fascinatingly awful? Shirin is comprised entirely of individual head-and-shoulder shots of Iranian women in a cinema audience. We only hear the film they are watching, an adaptation of the classical Persian fable Khosrow and Shirin. The reactions of the women are, of course, the main focus, and the unseen film itself remains of considerable interest, but Kiarostami has pushed audiences a little too far. He no longer appears all that interested in cinema, seemingly reinventing himself as an installation-type-artist-cum-film-maker. In contrast, Hayao Miyazaki's new anime, Ponyo On the Cliff By the Sea, proved a kiddie-friendly crowd-pleaser. While it is no Spirited Away, this adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid was easy on the eye and fun to watch - and it is a vast improvement on his last film that was released in the UK, the lumbering Howl's Moving Castle. There was very little British interest - most of the Film Council's efforts seem to be directed at getting movies into Toronto. Apart from the Coen film, which was produced by Working Title, the only other Brit iron in the fire was Vinyan, part-financed by Film Four. Vinyan is directed by Fabrice du Welz, who made such a splash with Calvaire, his Deliverance-style ordeal movie set in Belgium. But it's a real mess. Using Apocalypse Now as its model, it has a European couple (Emmanuelle B\u00e9art and Rufus Sewell) going up-river into Burma in search of their lost son, previously thought drowned in the tsunami. While Du Welz shows a precocious visual sense, and makes decent use of his jungle locations, very little feeling of menace is generated, and the script's machinations seem absurd rather than nightmarish. The new film from Turkish-Italian director Ferzan Ozpetek is a gruesome story of domestic abuse and killing called, with readily apparent irony, A Perfect Day, in which a cop terrorises his ex-wife then kidnaps their two children. No prizes for guessing it all ends badly. I found it gripping, but I suspect it will show only at festivals in the UK, if at all. But it was another homegrown talent, one from a considerably more successful generation, that provided my most enjoyable experience. Venice still dines out on the great postwar clutch of gifted Italian film-makers - Rossellini, Fellini, Visconti - and arguably the most extraordinary was accorded a special screening of a documentary made in 1962. Pier Paolo Pasolini was murdered in 1975, but he left behind a remarkable body of work, now under the curatorship of Giuseppe Bertolucci, the brother of another Italian film-making legend. La Rabbia (The Anger) was a film essay commissioned by the owner of a newsreel company, who provided his archive for Pasolini to edit. But after getting cold feet, the producer removed a large chunk of Pasolini's film and replaced it with one by a popular rightwing journalist. Pasolini, a committed Marxist, eventually acquiesced, but Bertolucci has returned to Pasolini's original notes and created a reconstruction of what the master had planned. La Rabbia is a fascinating film, in which Pasolini correctly identified decolonised nations as the new source of global power. Pasolini appears to have become a secular saint, with Bertolucci's film receiving a rapturous reception. Some things end happily after all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
