They lost \u00a3940,745 in the year up to October 31, which followed a loss of \u00a31.6m in the previous 12 months, underlining how precarious the position was when a new regime, headed by the former HSBC executive Eamonn McManus, took over last winter. \"There have been a lot of changes and we are running the club as a business now,\" said the chief executive Brian Kelly. Saints have enjoyed easily the largest increase in attendances in the Super League this season and have also explored more unorthodox ways to raise cash such as selling their supporters electricity and gas, and Kelly insisted that the fresh losses would not force their coach Ian Millward to sell star players such as Keiron Cunningham and Sean Long. Cunningham was included yesterday in a 28-man Wales squad for the international against New Zealand at the Millennium Stadium on November 3, even though there are doubts about whether the Great Britain coach David Waite will allow him to play against the Kiwis before the three-Test series starts the following week. The squad includes two recruits from the coach Neil Kelly's club Widnes: Adam Hughes and David Mills. Justin Morgan, an Australian who played for Wales in the 2000 World Cup, is available again as, although he is currently with the New Zealand Warriors, he will be joining Toulouse as player-coach in the autumn. Warrington suffered another blow in their battle against relegation last night when their centre Ben Westwood was suspended for one match after his dismissal at Widnes on Sunday. The Leeds centre Chev Walker was also banned for one match for a high tackle against Hull last Friday. Mick Cassidy has signed a new two-year contract which will keep him with Wigan until he is 33.
