Despite \u00a362.6bn worth of sell-offs, including shares in Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, the National Audit Office (NAO) has expressed concern over an expected shortfall of financial assets worth \u00a3200m. Student loan debt is expected to hit \u00a31tn by 2047, which has become a major factor in the government\u2019s failure to control the sector\u2019s finances, the report indicated. It means that while the total received from selling assets plus loan repayments will be \u00a394.6bn over the next five years, this will be exceeded by the \u00a394.8bn cost of issuing new loans and other initiatives, leaving a shortfall of \u00a3200m. The findings are contained in a report issued on Thursday by the NAO into 54 financial institutions controlled by the government. These include four large banks and the help-to-buy scheme designed to support mortgage lending, as well as the British Business Bank and Green Investment Bank. Sir Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, questioned the continued existence of some of these schemes. \u201cFinancial institutions are becoming significant elements in the government balance sheet, creating a range of opportunities and risks, but no one part of government is taking an overview,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government should adopt a portfolio management approach alongside the traditional departmental oversight model to provide heightened assurance over the portfolio. Some of these institutions appear to have survived the market conditions they were created to alleviate after the financial crisis, and the rationale for their existence in the public sector is questionable.\u201d The number of government-controlled financial institutions had doubled since 2007, when the financial crisis saw taxpayers step in to shore up parts of the economy, including banking and housing. Government intervention in the financial sector totalling \u00a3107.6bn includes bailing out RBS, Lloyds, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Northern Rock. The report referred to a government-commissioned study showing that a sale of state shares in banks at July 2015 values would produce a surplus of \u00a314.9bn. But this does not take into account the cost of financing these investments \u2013 totalling about \u00a310.9bn for RBS and Lloyds, the report added. The government\u2019s exposure to debt was more than \u00a32tn between November 2009 and February 2014, the report found. \u201cIf the government decides to reduce its financial services portfolio, an orderly exit from the sector will take many years,\u201d it said. Meg Hillier MP, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said the government was failing to inspire confidence. \u201cThe government expects to make \u00a363bn from selling its shares and loan books and \u00a332bn from being repaid loans. Despite the unprecedented scale of these plans, they will not be enough to cover the funding needed for new interventions such as issuing student loans or funding schemes such as help to buy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government\u2019s poor track record in achieving value for money from selling shares and getting back the money will give the public little confidence that the debt increase will be limited to \u00a3200m.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
