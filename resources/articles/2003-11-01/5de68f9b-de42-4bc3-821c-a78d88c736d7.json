Cast-iron evidence was usually scant, however, with posters - a high proportion of whom were called Barry from Dudley - often resorting to more nudges and winks than an Eric Idle Appreciation society, rather than any hard facts. No longer. Because now Aston Villa's website has gone professional, it boasts exclusives and all sorts. Like today's exclusive chat with David O'Leary, which exclusively reveals that he's exclusively not going back to Leeds United - despite reports that his relationship with chairman Doug Ellis has gone Glenn Roeder-face sour. \"I'm here at Aston Villa and I'm happy at Aston Villa,\" O'Leary insisted, as his facial muscles affected a smile. \"I knew it was going to be a hard job - but I'm no quitter. David O'Leary is not a man to throw him dummy out of the pram over money.\" So it's official then. O'Leary, like Villa this season, is going nowhere. Which is a shame for the punters who've backed the Irishman down from 66-1 to 7-1 for the Leeds job. But with the Elland Road board still paying off O'Leary's \u00a34m compensation from his dismissal in 2002, Leeds fans are unlikely to be too disappointed, right? \"I think a lot of people are unaware of the damage his book did to the club, the way he lost the dressing room. There's no way he would get that back,\" explained Leeds United Independent Fans' Association co-founder Simon Jose. \"I would rather gouge my eyes out with a rusty spoon than have O'Leary back!\" Right. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We needed a bit of time to settle in. A new club, new team-mates, it's not as easy as people think!!!\" - Lorenzo Amoruso defends his and Barry Ferguson's poor early-season form at Blackburn. Two words, Lorenzo, and one of them is Duff. IT'S TIME TO WRITE ABOUT THIS WEEKEND'S INTERNATIONALS! Well, that's as maybe. However, as we don't like writing about international football, we're simply not going to. [From afar, The Man tweaks the bit of string that runs along the office and is attached to the Fiver's front tail] AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHGGGHHHHFFFOO RRRFFFFUUUUCCCKKKKKSSSSSSAAAAKKKKEE ELETGOLETGOLETGOLETGOLETGOWE'LLDOITW E'LLDOITWE'LLDOITPROMISEPROMISEPROMISEL ETGOLETGOLETGaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh That's better, if a little bruised. Now, where were we? Ah yes, the internationals. Let's have a look. Hmm. Hmm. Yes, according to reports, Scotland have been handed a \"lucky omen boost\" ahead of their Euro 2004 play-off against Holland, with the appointment of Norwegian referee Terje Hauge. You see, he's officiated at Hampden twice before, and Scotland have won both times! Against the Faroe Islands. And Latvia. Is there a flaw in this? Meanwhile Christian Dailly has said... no, we've only got one life, let's move on. To Wales, who are playing Russia. Which is bad news for famous recluse Ryan Giggs, who has been forced to say something in public for the first time since uttering the word \"plates\" in that advert for Quorn burgers all those years ago. \"If I have another three or four years left in me, I would like to retire at the top with Manchester United,\" he announced apropos of nothing, without explaining how he'll be \"at the top\" in four years time without having moved to Chelsea first. Look, we're just facing facts. While all this crucial stuff is going on, England are - yawn - playing someone or other in the most tedious game of the wee... [Fiver's attention is caught by the string, which has suddenly pinged into a worryingly taut position] England are playing Denmark in what promises to be an excellent and thoroughly enjoyable friendly. Although sadly the game will not feature Steven Gerrard, who has pulled out with back-knack. Still, look on the bright side, at least he'll keep his personal unbeaten England record when Denmark stick five goals past the hapless David JammmmmmMMMMMMAAAAR RRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHGGGGGHHHHHHGG GGGGHHHHHOOOOOOOOAAARRRRRRRRR OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHGGGGGGGOOOO OOODDDDDDDDETCETC THE RUMOUR MILL Internazionale could lose Christian Vieri and Alvaro Recoba in the January transfer window as Roman Abramovich starts flashing the cash once again. Joe Kinnear fancies trying his hand as Crystal Palace manager. Ged Houllier's been spying some things beginning with A: Stuttgart's Aleksandr Hleb and Andreas Hinkel. And Gazza could soon be throwing his weight around at Walsall. NEWS IN BRIEF Rio Ferdinand has requested a personal hearing over this drugs charge business. He's denying misconduct. This only happened at 5.02pm; if we weren't running late, you'd never know. The gloves are off in the Bobby Robson v Lomana LuaLua showdown. The striker had a right old rollicking from Sir Bob after complaining that he wasn't being given a fair chance at St James' Park. Somewhat unwisely, LuaLua aired his grievances on the web, prompting Robson to rage: \"I run this football club, not LuaLua, and I decide who does or does not go out on loan. What he should do is keep his mouth shut and get out there and do what he is paid for. At times, I get brassed off with the modern professional footballer.\" Also whipping himself up into a frenzy is his namesake Bryan, after Bradford hinted he could soon be stepping out of the dole queue and into Nicky Law's shoes. Meanwhile Toon defender Andy O'Brien's appeal against the red card he received against Chelsea last weekend has been turned down, as has West Ham striker Jermaine Defoe's. And West Brom midfielder Michael Appleton has announced his retirement after failing to overcome a knee injury caused by a training-ground accident two years ago. Boss Gary Megson said: \"This is one of the saddest days I've had as a manager. Losing a player with the character of Michael is a massive, massive blow.\" TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO Five: Jonathan Pearce's Football Night (12.45am) This non-bongo/snuff business started so well. Dutch Football (1.25am) Face it, whose living room wouldn't be improved dramatically with a framed Emile Heskey 10-pound note hanging above the mantelpiece, eh? Argentinian Football (3am) And some Aston Villa employee's soiled tracksuit bottoms - available on eBay but we've haplessly deleted the link - are literally not to be sniffed at.

Newstalk 106 (www.newstalk106.ie): On The Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) \"Grrrr!\" he grrrs, wielding his saw and almost certainly under the influence, as the Fiver thanks the Lord that it's Friday tomorrow.
