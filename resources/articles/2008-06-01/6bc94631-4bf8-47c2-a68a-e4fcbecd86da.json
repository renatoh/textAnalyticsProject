I'm a low earner so I can hardly fly out for weekends in Los Angeles. How have other readers kept their long-distance romances alive without spending a fortune? Make it a beneficial experience I rely on good old text messages, regular phone calls and little love letters hidden in his bag. As you describe yourself as a \"low earner\", why don't you seriously consider going with him? Sabbaticals can only make your CV and outlook exotic and interesting. Given life is so expensive, living together in one place can only be more economical. You might have to think carefully about getting married to dodge any visa complications; or, if this is too definite for your current relationship, investigate a working visa for a year. Check out Destination USA for more information. Jude Brooks, Somerset Three choices A loving relationship is far more important than a job. Ask yourself if your boyfriend is being selfish in taking this job; is there not one that he could do just as well in this country? Your options are to persuade him otherwise, to follow him abroad by getting a job there yourself, or dump him and look elsewhere. Robert Parrish, Devon Letters from America My husband of 34 years and I kept our relationship going for four years from first meeting to our wedding in 1974 by writing to each other every day. After the first year, we visited each other alternately every Christmas, Easter and summer. The letters were from the heart, honest and long. We looked forward to them and they mirrored our feelings as our relationship developed. Rose Krzyz, Woodford Green, Essex Frequent contact I have lived apart from my wife for a year and a half. She's working for a company in Tokyo. It's possible to live apart for a limited time. We telephone each other almost every day with a 4p-a-minute rate from BT, despite the time difference. In addition we email. To be in touch very often is the key to keeping the relationship alive. Where there is a will there's a way. Ronald Smith, Bournemouth Support network A long chat on Skype with a visual link is as near as you'll get to being with him. Text and email too, but occasional cards and letters show more thought and bring you closer. You can order gifts from US stores over the internet and have them delivered direct to him. Try and see each other about every six to eight weeks in another country altogether, if flights there are cheaper. Be supportive - it isn't easy setting up on your own in another country, and although the person who's away may seem to have the best deal, it can be lonely at times. My husband and I are in your situation and are very supportive of each other - this makes us realise just how strongly we are connected, even though we are far apart. The time goes faster than you think - you'll make it. Teresa Copp, Woking, Surrey, who wins this week's \u00a325 National Book Token Rebtel with a dreamy cause Try using a service such as Rebtel to make low cost international calls. I've been using it for a couple of years now and it is dreamy. Calls to the states are particularly cheap; it's actually cheaper for me to call people there than it is to call friends who live down the road. mpwnw1, via theguardian.com/money You've got live Have lots of phone sex, write long letters and send airmail parcels with gifts of food, photos and personalised trinkets. Email, phone and text regularly. Make sure you have a fantastic social life at home (sign up for an evening class), see friends and family and encourage him to really explore the area where he is living and to have an active social life, too. Then, if you are still together in years to come, you can look back at this short episode in your relationship as one of excitement, tension and longing. Sophie Hewitt, by email Twitter on Try a Twitter account - it will allow you to keep in touch a little bit throughout the day without paying for international texts. Also, there's a service you can find online called Talkster, which allows you to call internationally for the price of a local call. Very low effort and low cost compared to an international calling card. Although Skype still beats it hands down if you both have internet access. McScrappy, via theguardian.com/money A happy ending I spent a year studying in the US while my then girlfriend stayed in the UK. We remained romantic by sending each other long letters and emails regularly, and phoning as often as possible. You can get very cheap tariffs for calls to the US, but remember to call during off-peak hours. My girlfriend managed to come over twice, using cheap airline fares. It must have worked because we married in 2006. Joe Street, Sheffield Hard but rewarding I spent nine months working in California while my girlfriend stayed in the UK. It's worth warning that long-distance relationships are hard work for both parties. The plus side is that the time you do spend together is much more special and, when you do go over, you get to be shown round by a \"local\". Mark Stephenson, Sheffield Year out shout Why not go with your boyfriend for the year? As you said, you are in a low-paid job here, so you've not much to lose. And, as I found out when I was in similar circumstances, cash-in-hand jobs are available there. Plus, it's a great place to spend a year. Will Roberts, by email Oscillate wildly It'll make or break your relationship. You should be able to keep it going by technical means (Skype especially is fantastic), but the big test will be when he returns. Be ready for a roller-coaster ride: the troughs of yearning and loneliness, the highs of re-encounter. This can also falsify relationships somewhat ... also consider what you'll do if his contract is extended - maybe you should both discuss this. Dimlocator, via theguardian.com/money This week's question: My wastrel son is back from university for the summer and shows no interest in earning any money. How do I encourage him to discover the pleasure of work, and what's the most rewarding summer employment for an undergraduate - financial or otherwise?
