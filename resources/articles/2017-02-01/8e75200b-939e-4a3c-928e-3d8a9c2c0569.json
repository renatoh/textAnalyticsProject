Mathias is his twin brother, a forward for Sparta Rotterdam. The pair played on the same youth teams together, first while growing up as children to Guinean immigrants in Roissy-en-Brie, Paris, and then after joining Celta Vigo in Spain at 16. But neither has ever played with or against their younger brother, Paul, United\u2019s world record signing. \u201cThe rules in the youth league we played in was that no player could play in an age group more than two years above his actual age no matter how good or big he was,\u201d says Florentin, who is three years older than Paul. \u201cOf course we played together informally \u2013 there was a pitch just across from where we lived and we\u2019d go there every day. At first Paul played with the guys his own age but soon that stopped being fun for him so he came to play with us. He was always excellent technically but he used to get pushed off the ball at the beginning because he wasn\u2019t built like the older guys but once he toughened up he thrived. \u201cWe used to play every day and hope that one day all three of us would play together in a professional match. That was the biggest dream. We haven\u2019t managed it yet but having two of us together on the pitch is already good.\u201d Florentin and Mathias were born in Conakry before the family emigrated and later pledged their international allegiance to Guinea, whereas Paul opted to play for the land of his birth, France. Florentin and Mathias did wear French jerseys, however, when supporting their brother from the stands during Euro 2016. \u201cWe are each others\u2019 biggest supporters and I am proud of everything we have achieved,\u201d says Florentin. \u201cWe have all made a lot of sacrifices to become professionals. Leaving home when we were very young, for example, was really hard. Mathias and I were 16 when we went to Spain and, if that was tough for us, it was even harder for our parents. But ultimately they accepted that making it in football is a fight, nothing comes easy.\u201d Florentin moved back to Sedan in France after two years in Spain and then joined Saint-\u00c9tienne in 2012. Mathias, meanwhile, has played for seven clubs since Celta Vigo, including Wrexham and Crewe Alexandra. At the same time as Florentin and Mathias went to Spain, their parents, Fassou and Yeo, also waved goodbye to Paul, although at least he went only as far as Le Havre at first. But when he reached 16 he, too, left the country, joining Manchester United for the first time before heading to Juventus three years later to become a big-time player in earnest. Four Serie A titles later he returned to United as the world\u2019s most expensive player but, says Florentin, as the same person. \u201cThe transfer fee is just a detail,\u201d says Florentin. \u201cHe didn\u2019t decide it. There are some crazy aspects to the world of football. Some of them are bonuses, some of them are real challenges but the most important thing is the same all the way through \u2013 the game and the love for it. Paul is exactly the same person now as he always was. He hasn\u2019t been changed by the transfer fee or anything else. The only thing I feel about his success is happiness because I know how hard he worked for it.\u201d Apart from his footballing prowess, Paul seems blessed with a personality that makes handling his status hassle-free. Rather than wilt in the spotlight he seems to revel in it. Was he always like that? Have his older brothers helped him navigate through the business? \u201cBecause he progressed so much more rapidly he learned how to manage everything very quickly \u2013 he had to,\u201d says Florentin. \u201cOf course we talk all the time but I don\u2019t know how much influence that has had. What I do know is that he works hard and takes things in his stride.\u201d Paul\u2019s rise could conceivably have had a negative effect on the careers of Florentin or Mathias, as constant comparison to the world\u2019s most expensive player could have become irritating or worse. But Florentin, too, takes things in his stride. \u201cOf course there are times when I\u2019m referred to only as \u2018the brother of\u2019. But why should that bother me?\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m proud of my family and, besides, whenever I hear that stuff I always think that nearly every other player on the pitch is also someone\u2019s brother.\u201d It is just that usually most people do not know the other players\u2019 brothers. Florentin, meanwhile, does not know what it will be like playing against his sibling. \u201cPlaying with Mathias was brilliant. We had an understanding that is very difficult to explain. We just instinctively knew where each other was and what we were going to do,\u201d he says. \u201cPlaying against my brother, on the other hand, will be something new. We\u2019ve been having fun about it ever since the draw, sending messages like \u2018Watch out, the match is getting closer\u2019 and so on.\u201d They also have regular amusing exchanges about other matches - because of Florentin\u2019s devotion to one of United\u2019s rivals. \u201cArsenal are the club of my heart,\u201d he says with glee. \u201cI\u2019ve supported them ever since the Invincibles \u2013 what a team! The downside of being a professional is you rarely get a chance to go to watch other teams so I\u2019ve never actually been to the Emirates. But one day I will, hopefully.\u201d One day, indeed, he may play there. There were reports of interest in him from several Premier League clubs last summer, including Sunderland. \u201cThere were contacts but nothing concrete,\u201d he says of the speculation. The question of support, of course, raises the issue of how the rest of the Pogba family will follow Thursday\u2019s match. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a case of everyone wanting us both to play well and may the best team win,\u201d says Florentin. Saint \u00c9tienne are in decent form in Ligue 1, their chase for a European spot helped by last week\u2019s rousing victory over fierce their local rivals Lyon, a match in which Florentin excelled at left-back, having been moved from his usual position in the centre. He could play in either position against United. \u201cOf course United will be a tough match for us but it will also be tough for United,\u201d says Florentin, who offers only one other prediction for the match. \u201cI\u2019ve never asked a player to swap jerseys at the end of the game, although I do have some because when I\u2019ve played against friends we\u2019ve just sort of swapped spontaneously. I think that after this game there\u2019ll be a quite natural exchange of shirts.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
