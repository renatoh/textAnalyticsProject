A colour code denoting grey (all respondents), blue (Remainers) and red (Leavers), applied only to the first section, which posed questions about the nature of any future deal. Two further sections, which asked for approval ratings for the prime minister and opinion on whether leaving the EU would ultimately be good or bad for the UK, detailed results from all respondents and, despite being coloured grey, blue and red, did not relate to voting behaviour at the referendum. Apologies. Naming names: we mistakenly gave the prominent Brexit MP John Redwood a knighthood last week (\u201cThey\u2019re back, as wrong as ever. Enough of Lawson and his band of 80s ultras\u201d, Comment, page 34) and Brass Eye targeted the DJ Bruno Brookes, not Brooks (\u201cChris Morris\u2019s genius lives on\u201d, In Focus, last week, page 27). The children crossing the border into the United States, whose stories are chronicled in the book Tell Me How It Ends, are not solely \u201cundocumented Mexicans\u201d. This error was not the author\u2019s. (New Review, last week, page 37).
