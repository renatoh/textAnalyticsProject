The Surrey captain Adam Hollioake has been called up to replace him. Lord MacLaurin, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, had last week lambasted Flintoff's efforts to recover from a double-hernia operation and said yesterday: \"I think it's very sad for the England side. A fit and in-form Freddie Flintoff is a big bonus for the team. He certainly felt that he was fit enough to go, and I'm sure we took all the necessary safeguards and opinions from medical people. It's sad that it hasn't worked out. It's a great opportunity for Adam Hollioake, for whom I have a high regard, but it's always sad when a player has to come home.\" The England coach Duncan Fletcher finally ran out of patience with Flintoff's continuing breakdowns, by which he failed to regain his fitness for any of the three Tests against Australia despite repeated efforts at a comeback. \"We have had other important decisions to make and half the time we have been trying to find out where we stood with Andrew, which is why it's important now he goes back and sorts the problem out,\" said Fletcher yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
