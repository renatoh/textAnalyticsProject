Their ties have been tested by the most severe political storms. When the now prime minister Johnson became the face of the leave camp during the EU referendum, his siblings Rachel, Leo, and Jo passionately made the case for the UK to remain in the bloc. Rachel joined the newly formed and now defunct Change UK (she would later describe herself as a \u201crat that jumped on to a sinking ship\u201d), while Jo dealt an extraordinary blow to his brother\u2019s premiership after he quit as an MP and minister, citing an \u201cunresolvable tension\u201d between his family loyalty and the national interest. In her newly released memoir, Rachel notes: \u201cDoing what we are told not to do is a family trait.\u201d So when the prime minister ordered the country to stay at home and practise social distancing last month in an effort to deal with the coronavirus epidemic, it probably came as no surprise that their father Stanley, a former MEP, defied him, insisting: \u201cYes of course I\u2019ll go to the pub if I need to go to a pub.\u201d In recent days, the family has largely maintained a public silence \u2013 but they have expressed their support by other means. All three siblings liked or retweeted Johnson\u2019s message thanking hospital staff and tweets from well wishes from people across the political spectrum. Leo Johnson, whose recent activity on Twitter suggests he also approves of Labour\u2019s new leader, Keir Starmer, liked a tweet by the Church of England praying for his brother\u2019s recovery. The youngest sibling is the only one to stay out of politics, working instead for the firm PwC and appearing occasionally on BBC Radio 4. Coronavirus patients aren\u2019t allowed visitors, which will undoubtedly be difficult for the close-knit family, particularly for Carrie Symonds, the prime minister\u2019s fiancee, who is seven months pregnant. The 32-year-old is currently self-isolating after experiencing coronavirus symptoms herself. She and the Johnson family received a message from the Queen on Tuesday, saying they were in her thoughts and that she wished the prime minister a full and speedy recovery. Rachel has also publicly supported her brother\u2019s response to the coronavirus. During last month\u2019s appearance on ITV\u2019s Loose Women, Rachel said: \u201cI do support him, I think he\u2019s doing an incredible job. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see somebody carrying such a weight of responsibility but he is strong. It\u2019s really hard up there to know they\u2019re doing the right decisions \u2026 this could crash the economy.\u201d She added: \u201cThese are really, really dark times.\u201d She was also quick to defend her father, Stanley, who was heavily criticised for saying he would ignore the government\u2019s advice on how to avoid the coronavirus, admitting that while it was \u201ca stupid thing to say\u201d, her dad wasn\u2019t trying to be \u201cprovocative\u201d. Rachel has long dismissed suggestions that the ideological differences within her family have resulted in any strife. She tweeted last year: \u201cI said last night at a charity do that the family avoids the topic of Brexit, especially at meals, as we don\u2019t want to gang up on the PM!\u201d In the book Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition, author Sonia Purnell notes: \u201cThere is tension, yes, but little division among them. Constantly moving house meant it was nigh on impossible to form meaningful relationships with anyone else their own age, had they been urged to do so.\u201d In a 2005 interview with Grove Magazine, Rachel said of her siblings: \u201cWe never, ever, went to play with other children. We didn\u2019t need friends.\u201d Their bond has clearly survived the test of time \u2013 and political crises."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
