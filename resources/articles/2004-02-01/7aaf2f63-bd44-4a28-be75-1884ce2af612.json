No matter how hard you try, circumstances always conspire against you. In the Fiver's case, a mid-sized Welsh hill scuppered our ill-fated Branson-beater. For Gordon Strachan, meanwhile, it was probably Glenn Hoddle knocking on his office door with a pot plant and a copy of Spurs: The Glory Years tucked under his arm. Yes, three months early and with tearful farewells behind the locked gates of St Mary's, Wee Gordie Krankie's reign at Southampton is over. \"This is a truly great (sob) club with a truly great squad of professionals (sob). It is with regret that I am leaving (sniff),\" explained Strachan, before being callously shoulder-charged aside by Saints chairman, Rupert Lowe-Profile. \"Gordon and I met yesterday and have both concluded that it is in the best interests of the club for him to step down as manager,\" he barked. \"Gordon has done a great job for us during his two-and-a-half-year tenure and, unusually in football, leaves us on the very best of terms.\" Hmm. Now who might have been referring to there, then? While Lowe went onto insist that \"excellent coach\" Steve Wigley would take charge of the first team until the end of the season, several Saints fans had caught a whiff of Eileen Drury's healing joss sticks across St Mary's. And my, were they unhappy. \"It's a very, very big gamble for Rupert Lowe if he appoints Glenn Hoddle because he's going against public opinion,\" thundered Southampton supporters club frontman Nick Illingworth. But seeing as Lowe told fans yesterday that \"sometimes the popular choice is not the right one,\" what price Hoddle will be reducing St Mary's wheelchair capacity come the end of the month? * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I am a positive man. Why should I think I will lose the match? Do you think in one hour you will be dead?

So we'll be honest with you and lay our cards on the table: the tale you're about to read is so jaw-achingly dull, it could bore a stolid statistician into submission. Now ordinarily we'd attempt to get round this with a jazzy introduction, but wool-pulling with this yarn is pointless, for it involves the biggest collection of grey suits this side of a Burton's warehouse, meeting to discuss the interpretation of the offside rule. Unfortunately for you, we know you're killing time before the pub, so on we go. Several senior officials in FA, Premier League and Football League blazers (elbow patches obligatory) today decreed that if any player in an offside position is \"deceiving or distracting an opponent\" then he can from this day forth be judged offside. \"It was felt that a decision needed to be taken on how to apply this interpretation to the type of situations we have seen during the past week,\" droned FA livewire John Baker, clicking to a slide of rotund rule bender Sam Allardyce and pointing his stick. \"This is particularly in relation to attacking free-kicks at Leicester on Tuesday, fat boy,\" he only partly added. Keen followers of the laws of football should get out more, but at least they won't need reminding that this ruling was actually agreed last October, and by the International Football Association Board no less. \"We've simply sought to clarify the manner in which [the ruling] should be applied by referees,\" chirped Baker, who may or may not still live at home with his parents. \"If, in the opinion of the referee, the actions of a player in an offside position deceive or distract an opponent, that player will be given offside,\" he concluded, as the Fiver reached for the gin and its reader bolted for the door. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Chelsea are set to tempt Ronaldo with \u00a3230,000 a week, though a Pukka Pie on a fishing line might have more success.
