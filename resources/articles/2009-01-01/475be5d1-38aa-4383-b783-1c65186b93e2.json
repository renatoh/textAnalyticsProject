Questions were also raised about the immigration status of his housekeeper. Barack Obama's team defended him today, saying the offences were \"honest mistakes\". Republicans on the Senate finance committee were meeting today to discuss the new developments. Geithner is due to appear before the committee for a confirmation hearing Thursday. The revelations will ensure he will have a tougher confirmation hearing than Obama's team had been anticipating. Barack Obama's press spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said Geithner had been chosen because of his reputation and service to the country. \"That service should not be tarnished by honest mistakes, which, upon learning of them, he quickly addressed. He made a common mistake on his taxes, and was unaware that his part-time housekeeper's work authorisation expired for the last three months of her employment,\" Gibbs said. He called on the committee to confirm Geithner with strong bipartisan support. The Wall Street Journal revealed today that there were questions about years in which Geithner allegedly did not pay social security and Medicare taxes. The paper also said there were questions about whether his housekeeper had worked in the US without proper authorisation. Senator Charles Grassley, the senior Republican on the finance committee, is looking into both issues. The Wall Street Journal said the housekeeper's papers apparently expired while she still worked for Geithner. She later received a green card to work legally in the US and immigration authorities did not press charges. Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, apparently did not pay the tax while working with the International Monetary Fund between 2001 and 2004. When the US internal revenue service raised this with him, he paid the taxes with interest. He will be defended by the Democrats on the committee, who say that the mistakes are minor compared to the scale of the economic crisis he will have to face as treasury secretary. Similar problems in the past have scuppered the chances of those nominated for office. Bernard Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner, withdrew as President George Bush's homeland security secretary after failing to pay taxes on an illegal immigrant working in his house."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
