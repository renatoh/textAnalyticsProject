To shoot \u201clooting hordes from Atlanta\u201d. That\u2019s the campaign message from a former Republican congressman from Georgia, Paul Broun, who is now running for Congress again. Broun\u2019s campaign is based in Gainesville, Georgia, a city about an hour outside of Atlanta, the state capital, which is majority-black. Gainesville is in Hall county, Georgia, which is majority white, although nearly half of the residents of the city of Gainesville itself are Latino, according to census estimates. In a new campaign video, Broun promises to give away an AR-15 rifle \u201cto one lucky person who signs up for email updates\u201d from his campaign website. \u201cIn uncertain times like these, the right to defend yourself and your property and your family could not be more important,\u201d Broun says in a campaign video, in which the 73-year-old is filmed striding through the grass and shooting a rifle. \u201cWhether it\u2019s looting hordes from Atlanta, or a tyrannical government from Washington, there are few better liberty machines than an AR-15.\u201d Americans have responded to the coronavirus epidemic with a record-breaking number of gun purchases. More than 3.7m total firearm background checks were conducted through the FBI\u2019s background check system in March, with nearly 1.2m checks conducted in the week of 16 March alone, according to government data. While not a one-to-one correlation, background checks serve as best official proxy for gun sales in the US. In a phone interview Tuesday, Broun defended the reference to \u201clooting hordes from Atlanta\u201d as \u201cnot racial\u201d. \u201cOnly the liberal press would take that kind of position,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of white people in Atlanta as well.\u201d \u201cMa\u2019am, I have been a keynote speaker at an MLK Day celebration,\u201d he said. Broun was dismissive of the idea that his rhetoric might concern black Georgia residents, or that this kind of rhetoric might increase the risk of innocent black Americans getting shot while in majority-white neighborhoods. \u201cGet real,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about black people having the means of protecting themselves just as much as white people or Hispanic people or Asian people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re the racist,\u201d he added. In the call, Broun referred to coronavirus as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d. Asked what evidence he had that the coronavirus pandemic might result in hordes of looters, Broun referenced civil unrest in Baltimore, Maryland, and Ferguson, Missouri, both majority-black cities where police killings of unarmed black men led to sustained protests over police treatment of black Americans. Once again, Broun denied that his repeated references to unrest in majority-black cities had anything to do with race. \u201cThere were white people protesting as well,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not see it as a racial incident. You\u2019re asking me of examples of looting and hordes of people doing that, and those are the first two that came to mind.\u201d The former congressman said he was concerned about an \u201ceconomic meltdown of this country because of this huge debt that we have\u201d, and that he had been concerned about such a crisis for decades. Denver, Colorado, or Missoula, Montana (which have majority-white populations) were potential sources of looters, too, he said, not just Atlanta. \u201cI think you will see looting hordes come out of the cities and go anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to see people that think they\u2019re entitled to TV sets, automobiles or anything else, and they\u2019re going to take them,\u201d he said. Broun, who had a reputation as one of the most conservative members of the GOP during his eight years in Congress, left office in 2015 under the shadow of an ethics investigation into his former chief of staff over taxpayer dollars spent to hire a political consultant known as the \u201ctea party whisperer\u201d.
