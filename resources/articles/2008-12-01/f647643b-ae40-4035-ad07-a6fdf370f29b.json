Congratulations and all that but is Lego Batman really the best kids game of the year? Sure, Batman is fun enough \u2013 though the \"Lego\" thing is wearing a bit thin now \u2013 but is it better than Mario Kart Wii or Professor Layton and the Curious Village, both of which were also nominated? Layton maybe - I'm not sure that really qualifies as a \"kids\" game anyway - but surely not Mario Kart? Having said that, after a weekend spent \"playing\" the Madagascar 2 game with my three year old \u2013 her two-word review would be \"more penguins\" \u2013 I would have happily stuck Lego Batman on given half a chance. But still. For those with children, or who are young at heart, what was your kids game of the year?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
