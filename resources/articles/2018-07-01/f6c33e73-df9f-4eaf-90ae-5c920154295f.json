Top stories The cost to taxpayers of the Australian government\u2019s six-year legal battle with the tobacco giant Philip Morris over plain packaging laws can finally be revealed, despite the government\u2019s efforts to keep the cost secret. The commonwealth government spent nearly $40m defending its world-first plain packaging laws, according to freedom of information documents. Former senator Nick Xenophon and his former staffer, now Centre Alliance senator, Rex Patrick, spent two years trying to obtain the documents. Philip Morris had taken its case to the permanent court of arbitration in 2012, using a clause in a 1993 Hong Kong-Australia trade deal to sue the Australian government. Patrick said he was blown away by the \u201cmammoth cost\u201d to taxpayers of the legal fight. \u201cThis is exactly why Australia must stop signing up to free trade agreements with these insidious ISDS provisions in them,\u201d he said. \u201cI accept the government had to defend the matter, but if we hadn\u2019t signed up to the Hong Kong agreement with ISDS provisions in it then there would not have been a tribunal hearing. Imagine what health outcomes could have been achieved with that $39m.\u201d Latin America\u2019s second-largest economy appeared poised to elect a silver-haired, baseball-loving leftist as its next president, as 89 million Mexicans headed to the polls on Sunday. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the 64-year-old leader of the Morena party, has cast the vote as an epoch-making opportunity to radically transform Mexico by electing a leader who will rid the country of corruption and rule for the 53 million Mexicans still stuck in poverty. Amlo has tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to become Mexico\u2019s president twice before, in 2006 and 2012, but his decision to make the fight against corruption the bedrock of his third presidential campaign appears to have paid off, with re-ballot polls suggesting the former Mexico City mayor would trounce rivals. Western Australia\u2019s Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, has accused his federal counterpart of making a racially-charged jibe. According to Wyatt, Nigel Scullion is \u201cunsuitable\u201d to resolve a dispute over funding for housing in remote Indigenous communities, after he used a racially charged jibe in a press release, which was headlined \u201cLittle Wyatt lies\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of my life having to deal with the slings and arrows of being an Aboriginal person,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cNigel Scullion is just the latest in that ... he\u2019s clearly unsuitable to try to resolve this issue and I am surprised and disappointed that he would resort to such rhetoric.\u201d WA has been at odds with the federal government since December over its decision not to renew the 10-year $5.4bn National Partnership Agreement on Remote Housing (NPARH). Australia\u2019s high wholesale electricity prices are the \u201cnew normal\u201d and politicians need to be honest with voters about it, a report by the Grattan Institute thinktank says. The report says federal and state governments must tell voters that government intervention to keep ageing legacy assets \u2013 such as old coal-fired power stations \u2013 working is a poor long-term soluti TV entertainer Bert Newton has come under fire for onstage comments at last night\u2019s Logie awards, praising TV stars for \u201cmentoring\u201d young talent \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d. Speaking about his long-time collaborator, Graham Kennedy, Newton said: \u201cGraham Kennedy was always the sort of man who nurtured young talent...You knew if you went to his dressing room it was locked, he will be inside doing some mentoring. Don Lane was a mentor too.\u201d In other Logies news, Grant Denyer won the night\u2019s top award, the Gold Logie. Russia have eliminated Spain from the World Cup in their last-16 showdown and a penalty shootout, tying the game 1-1. It had been said that they were the worst team in Russia\u2019s history but they are still here in their own tournament while their opponents \u2013 supposed to be the best team in Spain\u2019s history \u2013 are no more. Croatia have just defeated Denmark 3-2 on penalties after a 1-1 draw. In other World Cup news, explore how four of the top teams no longer at the World Cup are coping (or not). Sport Most NRL sides have one player that\u2019s irreplaceable, and while the Canberra Raiders\u2019 Josh Hodgson isn\u2019t of the same calibre as a Johnathan Thurston, Cameron Smith or Andrew Johns, without him the Raiders struggle. But even he can\u2019t stop them playing dud rugby, including surrendering another big lead, writes Matt Cleary. Collingwood\u2019s sixth straight win is beginning to bring optimism to a fanbase that\u2019s endured a pretty lean past four years. But it\u2019s a tale told in reverse for the Demons, who started the year brightly only to unravel dramatically, writes Craig Little. Thinking time Conflict has always been critical to news, writes the Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy. \u201cBut media disruption has intensified the conflict cycle, ... and those constant interruptions have a material impact on political decision-making,\u201d Murphy argues. \u201cThe \u2018new, now\u2019 news cycle, where minute developments are reported in real time, means internal processes of consideration and decision-making are disrupted much more frequently. The disruptions then often materially affect outcomes \u2013 governments change course, drop ambitious ideas, shape shift to try to avoid an unmanageable stakeholder backlash.\u201d For years the music industry has argued that YouTube exploits the lack of legal protection around music videos being viewed on its service, to pay minimal amounts to artists and labels, with Taylor Swift leading the charge to get a better share of revenues in the age of the digital music giants. The stoush is coming to a head this week in a crucial vote in Brussels, that could force YouTube to pay billions of dollars in fees to popular artists such as Swift, Ed Sheeran and Katy Perry. When award-winning Australian children\u2019s author Lorraine Marwood was diagnosed with cancer, it upended her world, but ultimately gave her a new perspective on life. During a year dominated by chemo and radiation treatments she wrote just one book, Leave Taking, aimed at children dealing with death and grief. \u201cWhy did I write about grief?\u201d writes Marwood. \u201cBecause grief is a tangible part of life; because being a child or an adult does not give you immunity from its crippling effects.\u201d What\u2019s he done now? Donald Trump has again urged America to ditch the law when it comes to returning illegal immigants to their home country, his second tweet in a week to encourage anarchy. \u201cWhen people come into our Country illegally, we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering. Our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world. Republicans want Strong Borders and no Crime. Dems want Open Borders and are weak on Crime!\u201d Media roundup GPs are warning people who use pharmacy health checks that they are risking their health long-term. The walk-in tests are cheap and quick, but The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is urging people to avoid them, saying the checks are motivated by profit \u2013 not welfare, the SMH reports. Tasmania\u2019s business boom is leading the nation, the Mercury reports, but the state\u2019s ageing population could take the shine off the golden economic stats, economists warn. The ABC visits cannabis-growing houses hiding in suburban homes across the country, in this multimedia feature. The majority of cannabis is grown in suburban homes, the police report, with 2.1 million Australians saying they used the drug in the last year.
