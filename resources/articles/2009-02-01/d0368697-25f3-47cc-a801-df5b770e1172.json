He did equal Bobby Moore's record for an England outfield player of 108 appearances, but merely as a substitute. The midfielder was booked for dissent near the end, but the main event to occur in his presence was a second Spain goal when Fernando Llorente, who had come on for Fernando Torres, headed home a Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez free-kick after 82 minutes. Beckham did put the substitute Carlton Cole through on his debut six minutes later but his finish from the left was kicked off the line. It was, all the same, an elementary win for Spain and that will not shock Fabio Capello. This was the second defeat under the Italian and the other, against France, had also seen his side unable to score. The options continue to be more restricted than he can accept with good humour. No immediate solution comes to mind since there could be little criticism of the starting line-up. With Rio Ferdinand ruled out by a stomach upset, it was instructive that Phil Jagielka's outstanding form for Everton should be recognised as he filled the vacancy. His candidacy, of course, was underpinned by recent domination of Liverpool's Spain centre-forward Fernando Torres at club level. Unfortunately, he was not pitted solely against a Merseyside rival. Jagielka was at fault when England fell behind but he was the victim of David Villa's compelling artistry and cannot be regarded as a mistaken selection. England had been beaten 1-0 by these opponents in both 2004 and 2007. That particular score spoke of the organisation and control that Spain embody. They might not cut loose but they are generally in charge, as they were again here. As with Manchester United, who have turned to mass production of clean sheets, the key is to ensure security by withholding the ball from the other side. Capello, anticipating that, had given thought to making England's presence felt in midfield. Indeed the combination of Michael Carrick and Gareth Barry, who had also started against Germany in November, utilised two footballers for whom it is natural to operate in deeper roles. Spain wanted to swamp England in midfield, but it seemed for much of the first half that they might do no more than exhibit technique. That delusion lasted 36 minutes. Then, Xabi Alonso fed a ball down the centre and Villa turned and tricked his way inside Jagielka. Before Terry could attempt to snuff out the danger the Valencia attacker stroked a low shot past the right hand of David James. Until then, England had seemed to be enduring the discomfort inflicted by Spain's technical superiority. They might even have had the lead. With six minutes gone, Barry had crossed from the left but Gabriel Agbonlahor missed the target with his drive. The latter was paired with Emile Heskey who, after recovering from an Achilles injury, discovered how tricky it was to link with team-mates as Marcos Senna and Alonso policed the areas close to the penalty box. Heskey was set to break clear early in the match but, although he had been fouled by Gerard Piqu\u00e9, was wrongly ruled off-side when the defender could, instead, have been sent off. Piqu\u00e9, the Barcelona player who was once with Manchester United, must have found international football relatively simple on his debut. In truth, the fixture had little drama, even if it did serve up some comedy. An attempt by Torres in the first half took a deflection from Jagielka and floated tamely into the area. James came out for a simple catch, but there may have been spin on the ball since he unexpectedly spilled it. England could not achieve enough to make slapstick much of a possibility at the other end. With Carrick and Barry conservative by nature, it fell to the wingers to present a threat. Downing, until his removal at the interval, was worthy rather than incisive. Shaun Wright-Phillips did not seem to demand the ball, which was irksome since his one real run carried him past three opponents before Piqu\u00e9 brought him down a few yards from the penalty area. It is wholly explicable that visitors facing the reigning European champions should look cumbersome by comparison, but Capello can hardly adopt a resigned tone. Adjustments were made, with Wright-Phillips switching to the left following the removal of Downing, while Beckham was introduced on the right. Heskey, as might have been anticipated because of his injury concerns, was replaced by Peter Crouch. But the alteration most helpful to the visitors was the departure of Villa. The England side, out of sheer relief, might have joined the crowd in cheering him off. Something went out of the game with him. Then Torres gave way to Llorent. Such decisions by the Spain coach were, of course, a relief to England. The exam paper of this fixture might not have seemed so great a puzzle any more. Even so, the challenge of disturbing such composed opponents was taxing all night long."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
