A Better Place, with a libretto by Cindy Oswin, is a product of ENO's Studio, developed over the past five years. This is exactly the kind of initiative the company should be taking, but the result this time is disappointingly pallid. Cast in a prologue and two scenes, A Better Place lasts 50 minutes but seems a lot longer. A wealthy, recently widowed woman, Suzanne, moves into a converted warehouse in London's Docklands. Rather than come to terms with her husband's death, she gives a home to two refugees, brother and sister Karen and Michel. Their arrival brings its own set of problems, and the new house also turns out to be haunted by the ghost of a Thames lighterman, Siward, who seeks Suzanne's death to provide his own release. When Suzanne reaches a crisis and attempts suicide, Karen and Michel stop her, and the loss of control both frees her from her past and redeems Siward. It's an unsatisfactorily contrived scenario. Suzanne's breakdown is not convincingly prepared, and the mix of the supernatural with the all too real plight of the refugees produces a puzzling hybrid. This is not a ghost story, nor an exploration of rootlessness, nor a political parable, and the final release of a ghost from his limbo is hardly a clinching dramatic moment for a modern audience. You don't care, nor are you made to care, about any of the characters. The text is earth-bound too, although Butler sets the unpromising lines in comfortably singable, if very Britten-like, phrases: the tenor writing for Siward inescapably recalls The Turn of the Screw. And though the orchestral writing (for an ensemble of 15 players, conducted here by Paul Daniel) is thoroughly proficient and clear, the memorable ideas are few (a set-piece tango, when Michel tries to seduce Suzanne, is an exception), and the pacing too unvaried. The production by Lenka Udovicki (with a packing-crate set by Soutra Gilmour) does what it can, and the four excellent singers squeeze maximum life from their roles. Mark Le Brocq as Siward has the most to get his teeth into, but Rebecca de Pont Davies has a difficult task making sense of Suzanne's character. As Karen and Michel, Gail Pearson and Roderick Williams have to resign themselves to roles that are more like psychological catalysts than real people. \u0095 Until tomorrow.
