According to the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) and the data provider IHS Markit, civil engineering activity dropped last month at the fastest rate since October 2009, as ministers held back from making decisions on landmark road and rail schemes. The latest snapshot comes amid heightened political uncertainty over large-scale building projects such as HS2 and the Heathrow third runway with MPs distracted from making decisions by Brexit. Key decisions have also been deferred until after next month\u2019s election. Questions over the future of HS2 have been allowed to drift under Boris Johnson\u2019s government, after the prime minister launched a review of the high-speed railway project, with a leading critic of the scheme as its joint author. A decision on HS2 is now not expected until after the election. Johnson has promised an infrastructure revolution to bring together communities after Brexit. Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said that construction firms \u201cvoiced concerns about the uncertain outlook for large-scale infrastructure projects upon which growth is expected to rest in the coming years\u201d. The IHS Markit construction purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) rose slightly to 44.2 last month from 43.3 in September, although remained significantly below the 50.0 level that separates economic growth from contraction. Civil engineering was the worst-performing area. House building also dropped at a faster rate in October, while activity in commercial construction also dipped for the 10th month running. The survey of construction firms, which is closely watched by the Treasury and the Bank of England for early warning signs from the economy, found that employment numbers continued a decline, with a fall in job numbers in every month since April. Construction companies said domestic political uncertainty and fears over the economy had dragged down activity levels last month, as politicians failed to break the Brexit deadlock. Firms also said unusually wet weather in October had served as an additional headwind to construction activity. Duncan Brock, group director at Cips, said: \u201cTo say these figures are disappointing is a big understatement. Given that the next political hurdle is December\u2019s general election, all eyes will be on the new administration and clear direction, because at the moment there is little insight into what could possibly pull the sector out of its ditch.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
