I am not concerned about the number of people entering the UK each year - the issues of asylum and immigration only concern me when a main political party whips up hysteria (aided and abetted by the tabloids) against immigrants and asylum seekers. I was hugely disappointed by Labour's kneejerk reaction to the Conservative plans, trying to out-tough them instead of deploring the Tories' entire strategy. The Lib Dem approach was measured and well thought out, but I wonder, cynically, whether they would be so generous if actually in office. So yes, I believe the Conservatives are playing the race card, and that they have cleverly boxed the Labour party into a corner by exploiting Michael Howard's Jewishness, thus making it difficult for the Labour machine to attack him. In terms of protecting our borders (whatever that means), I accept that there need to be controls to prevent terrorists, and people carrying disease - although, as anyone in the field knows - HIV, for example, may not be detectable at a test, and could take three months to develop. Are the Tories suggesting that every single person allowed into the country should be given a follow-up blood test after a few months? Also, as the recent conference on bird flu has suggested, we have no chance against a pandemic that develops because of air travel - so will all business travellers be tested as well? It's just not workable, but I don't think the Conservatives have any intention of bringing in any sensible system: they just want to whip up prejudice and phobia. In addition, I imagine parts of the NHS could not function without immigrants and temporary workers - many research and clinical doctors at Addenbrookes hospital are no doubt from other countries, and many of the catering and cleaning staff likewise - and who cares? Of all people, Michael Howard should know where his scaremongering leads. To quote an old Anti Nazi League leaflet: \"First they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for the Communists ... then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.\" (Pastor Niemoeller). I have recent Welsh and Irish antecedents and, further back, French - when it comes to a \"Britishness\" test, I will, no doubt, not do too well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
