The revelation, based on the Home Office\u2019s own data, has sparked accusations that the government is profiteering from vulnerable children and making a windfall profit by driving vulnerable families into debt. Campaigners point out that the government will profit whether the Syrian children\u2019s applications are successful or not: if they are refused, applicants are not refunded. If children reapply for citizenship, the fee must be paid again. Valerie Peay, the director of the International Observatory of Human Rights, has called on the next prime minister to end the \u201cpractice of profiteering from vulnerable children\u201d. The UK charges 10 times more than any other European country for child citizenship fees, at \u00a31,012 per child, plus \u00a319.20 to provide biometric information. They are charged an extra \u00a380 if they turn 18 during the application process. The cost of processing the application is \u00a3372. The charges have increased 51% in the last five years, during the period when Theresa May\u2019s Home Office instigated a \u201chostile environment\u201d policy to reduce immigration numbers. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear,\u201d said Peay. \u201cUnlike any other EU country, the UK government is choosing to profit \u00a3640 on every child who is entitled to apply for British citizenship. \u201cThis action puts huge pressure on families. It can\u2019t be right that a family with three kids will be expected to pay out \u00a35,448 to try to secure them a safe future, with nothing guaranteed at the end of the process. \u201cRather than driving families into debt to make a profit, we are calling on the UK government to stop this practice and join the rest of the EU in their approach to humanitarian support.\u201d The children, who have arrived in the UK since January 2014, can not yet apply for citizenship: they must wait for six years without access to most benefits before they can apply for full citizenship. But from next year, the first arrivals will be able to register. \u201cWith that influx of applications looming, the Home Office is set for a huge windfall due to the profit it makes on these forms,\u201d said Peay. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThese figures are speculative and hypothetical given that it is not mandatory to apply for citizenship in order to live, study and work in the UK. There is no fee for applying for settlement as a refugee or person who\u2019s been given humanitarian protection.\u201d But Peay said: \u201cWithout citizenship, you do not have the right to vote. You must pay international student fees for further education but are ineligible for student loans. You also face your leave to remain being withdrawn if you stay away from the UK for longer than two years.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
