There, atop an ancient rollercoaster of rusting metal and rattling wooden slats, the US Blackhawks can be seen buzzing past the memorial's steep sides. It was a place I liked to visit. But it was not for the outlook that I used to go to the amusement park, but something more intimate. Even amid the worst of the violence - when the victims of the death squads were choking the city's sewers - this park somehow was neutral territory. It was where the boys who could afford it would come to ride the Pirate Galleon during the festival of Eid, or play each other in wild games of ping-pong cheered on by a jostling crowd. It was here that lovers could come to walk discreetly on the concrete paths and parents of the youngest children would sit them gently on the painted horses of the merry-go-round. What this park spoke of, even as it became ever more deserted, was a possibility of normal life among the killing - and hope. It was the belief that continuing to grab this snatch of ordinary life, just for a moment, meant there remained the suggestion of a future. Five years into the suffering of Iraq, after the sectarian bloodshed, the bombs and the death squads and the flight of millions, after the billions wasted, the anniversary of this war requires one of its periodic moments of accounting. Even the smallest reckoning of the dead marks a terrible failure. The World Health Organisation's total number of dead for five years is 150,000-plus in a conflict that some believe may have killed several times that number. The highest estimates suggest a million. Beneath the statistics, the central question remains. It is the same question posed by those visiting the amusement park: what hope is there for Iraq, what possible future? On a superficial level at least, the news - after the months and years of violent decline - appears to hint at reasons for optimism. A combination of critical factors, including the US surge of troops around Baghdad last year, the continuance of the ceasefire by Shia followers of Moqtada al-Sadr and the influence of the anti- al-Qaeda Sunni 'Awakening' movement in Anbar, has given the impression of a country emerging out of its nightmare. At the centre of this perception is the reporting of headline figures on incidences of violence itself since the US-led surge around Baghdad. To the end of last year, those figures have appeared impressive: a sharp drop in the numbers of Iraqi civilians who died violently from 3,000 in November 2006 to 700 during December 2007. Major attacks also fell, from 130 in June 2007 to 40 in December. The fatality figures for coalition troops, too, which were averaging up to a 100 a month at the end of 2006, peaked at 130 in May 2007 before falling to 20 by the end of the year. In a final key indicator, the death toll from sectarian violence dropped from 2,200 in December 2006 to about 200 in November 2007. But those figures conceal as much as they reveal, not least because of the deliberately narrow definition of categories of violent events by those - in the US military in particular - collecting the data, choosing in effect to ignore attacks it deems non-threatening. On the issue of sectarian violence - as US officers themselves conceded to me last year both in Baghdad and in northern Iraq - the 'good news' on the decrease in Shia-Sunni violence was clouded by a more grisly background story. The inevitable separation of the communities in the places of the worst confrontation had brought to an end a period of cleansing, reducing the easy opportunities for sectarian murder. For now, at least, a phase in the sectarian confrontation has been brought close to completion. None of this, however, is to deny that ordinary Baghdadis have remarked on the improvements in security in recent months, even in the worst neighbourhoods. One friend, a resident of Ghazaliya, once one of the most dangerous areas, called me in London one evening at the beginning of the year from Baghdad to tell me his news. He had just seen a wedding party walking in the same streets where a year before he had watched running gun battles as the Sunni residents of his neighbourhood fought off a sustained Shia attack. My friend has not been alone in seeing an improvement. After a period where western journalists found it almost impossible to be seen travelling around Baghdad, reporters are once again venturing out. It is a movement towards a normalisation of sorts - although one that in recent weeks has seen violence climbing again. But it does not answer the question: where does Iraq's future lie? The answer is not to be found in the figures concerning the death tolls but in more complex considerations. Central to them is one of the awful facts of modern conflict: that it is an episodic and often self-fuelling process that can become 'frozen' for a time. In the settlement of one phase, the cause of the next outbreak of killing can easily be fixed. The key problems which have driven much of the slaughter have been set aside, not resolved. Laith Kubba, a former spokesman for Iraq's Prime Minister, summed up the critical problems facing the country early this month in a piece for the World Today, the magazine of Chatham House, home of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. 'The root cause of Iraq's mess,' he said, 'lies in a weak, dysfunctional state and a political system that rewards identity politics. It also legitimises rogue politicians, significantly weakens state power and compromises national recovery.' But Kubba is too passive in his attribution of blame. The reality is that the dysfunctional state that is Iraq is the consequence not only of a US-led invasion that set out to shatter and reconstruct Iraq's polity, but that also in the aftermath of Saddam's fall has chosen to play only lip service to the notion of a strong and genuine multi-party democracy. Throughout the continuing occupation, both the US and the UK have preferred quietly to ignore the principles they have been so loud in promoting. Instead, the leaders of the coalition's military forces have again and again chosen to cut deals at every level that have undermined the legitimacy of the government that it claims to be in Iraq to support. They have operated a hire and fire policy behind the scenes of governors and police chiefs and commanders of Iraq's military, a policy that has extended to the threats to Iraq's Prime Minister, Nuri al-Maliki, that he may be removed for failing to deliver on agendas set not by Iraqi politicians but by those in Washington. The net result, as Kubba acknowledges, is an Iraq that is 'under the control of a few power blocs' able to challenge state power. 'They remain above accountability, hide behind communal conflicts ... play raw politics with little regard for the national interest.' Rather, national interest in Iraq has been redefined as a series of essentially ad hoc and short-term deals that have succeeded in giving the impression of fixing Iraq's overarching problems of violence, temporarily at least, without solving the fundamental issues. But there has been a dangerous consequence for the long-term prospects for peace with these arrangements. What they have achieved, in reality, is the creation - and also the protection - of substantial armed movements on either side of the sectarian divide. The violence may have had a lid put on it for now, but the conflict still remains. In Anbar province, the US-backed tribal awakening councils, credited with a sharp decline in al-Qaeda-related violence, are becoming the source of new dangerous tensions. The Sunni councils, which can call on about 80,000 men under arms, are regarded with distrust by Iraq's Shias, while the awakening councils themselves are deeply uncomfortable with the Shia-dominated central government. In recent months new tensions have emerged with the groups' US sponsors, with tribal fighters angry over opportunities to join Iraq's security forces and resentful over their lack of political clout. On the Shia side - in particular concerning the armed followers of Moqtada al-Sadr - a far more complex accommodation exists, driven in large part by an unwillingness by the Shia-dominated government to go after the followers of the party with the largest single membership in Parliament and the acknowledgment by the US of how dangerous that strategy would be. The result has been a truce that has left the Sadrists by and large untouched in exchange for a halt to death-squad violence and attacks on coalition troops. The future of that accommodation, after Sadr's admission earlier this month that he was retiring disillusioned from politics, amid rumours of illness and with his movement fracturing, is now once again in doubt. It is also easily forgotten, as President George Bush has quietly lowered the bar for his goals in Iraq over the past year, that the US plan for Iraq during the period of the troop surge was not predicated simply on the military operations and security alone. The point of flooding Baghdad with troops, as Bush insisted on 10 January last year, was to give Iraq's government 'the breathing space it needs to make progress in other critical areas'. And it has been in the most important area of all that Iraq continues to be dangerously stalled: in the continuing and fatally corrosive lack of legitimacy invested in its central government and institutions in the country as a whole. Despite Washington's recent insistence on a series of measures designed to rebuild a lost sense of Iraqi unity - including calling on the government to overturn Paul Bremer's misbegotten debaathification of Iraq - that threw tens of thousands out of jobs and alienated Sunni society, it has had little traction. And with little movement on sectarian and ethnic reconciliation between the competing groups - Kurd, Shia and Sunni - every issue from security to oil and employment has become a focus for dangerous and repeated competition. Those rivalries are echoed in continuing strong factional competition, particularly among the Shia political parties and tribal rivalries. They are not alone in eroding any faint sense of legitimacy that the central government enjoys. For a vast majority of Iraqis that lack of legitimacy is, in any case, underscored by the central fact of the occupation itself. Because despite repeated US efforts over the past five years to give the impression that Iraq's institutions and leaders are sovereign and independent, it is the coalition that remains forcefully in the driving seat. The oft-repeated mantra by officials and military officers is that it is the Iraqis' show. But each joint military operation I have observed in the past 12 months has turned out the same. It begins with a solemn explanation by US officers of how they are only there to provide back-up, but as the mission unfolds it is inevitably the coalition soldiers in the front. There are other ways in which the legitimacy of Iraq's central institutions are severely undermined in what remains a deeply fractured state showing no signs of coalescing. And it is not simply the large degree of autonomy enjoyed by Kurdistan or the increasing separation of the centre from the south. At every level, Iraq looks like a series of dislocations. Last summer I took a journey around Iraq's north and west, beginning in the city of Mosul. There were things then that struck me powerfully as signs of progress: flying over the plains of wheat fully under agriculture for the first time since the war began. In Tal Afar, too - once a power base for al-Qaeda - I met refugees, both Shia and Sunni, returning from Syria. Their optimism was in stark contrast to the suicide bombing of a Shia wedding that I had stumbled on minutes after it had happened. But what struck me then - and still strikes me now - was not these two important counter-indicators to be balanced against each other in the calculation of hope and despair, but something more subtle and nuanced. Wherever I met Iraqi officials I would hear the same complaint. Civic leaders in Mosul spoke of a chronic lack of support from the government in Baghdad; their counterparts in Tal Afar had the same problem with the provincial council in Mosul, and so it continued to be echoed down the line until I found myself sitting on the floor of a village headman's house hearing the same complaint about the small town of Qaim. Nor were the complaints baseless. Instead, they reflect a fundamental feature of Iraq: the concentration of power and resources by those in positions of influence within every strata of governance and regional centre. The consequence - as senior US officials and diplomats admitted to me - has been the far-reaching crisis of legitimacy visible throughout the new institutions of post-Saddam Iraq. And for ordinary Iraqis the message is clear. While the experiment in democracy was exciting at first, far from establishing a vital new connection between the governing and governed - with all the issues of accountability implied - has simply created a whole new sphere of exclusions to mirror the exclusions of the Saddam period. Where that exclusion has been felt most powerfully, as Kubba rightly identifies, has been in the monopolisation of power, authority and wealth by armed groups attached to the political parties who have emerged as the biggest winners in Iraq. It is not simply that leaders in the Shia Jaish al-Mahdi of Sadr have emerged as powerful gang bosses. They have been able, too, to impose their own social norms in a way that has been particularly damaging for women's rights. Which leaves a picture of what? An Iraq that is improving? Or a failing country in a state of stasis, the violence suppressed by the weight of numbers of American troops? Even if it is indeed, as I strongly suspect, the latter, it is still not the complete picture of Iraq five years after the invasion. Iraq - for all its pain - cannot be seen in isolation. What has happened there has consequences for the region. The recent Turkish military incursion, although limited, has underlined the risks that many warned were inherent in the resurgent Kurdish desire for greater separation, with the implications that has for the Kurdish populations outside Iraqi Kurdistan. The emergence, after years of suppression, of the Shia majority as the dominant political force in Iraq, with a strong sense of entitlement after the Saddam years, has coincided with the rise of a wider Shia bloc within the region, coalescing around Iran. And there are less knowable effects. Iraq, it seems clear, has also been instrumental in redefining notions of warfare in the Middle East for a generation of young men brought up on the stories of Arab armies' defeats at the hands of Israel. Now the insurgency in Iraq - along with the pain inflicted by Hizbollah against Israel in the war of 2006 - has subtly altered the narrative. No longer is it the case that an assumption exists of inevitable defeat. Instead, it is the United States military, with all its technology and resources, which has been made smaller and less powerful by the experience of five years in Iraq. Five years. And who has not been defeated by Iraq?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
