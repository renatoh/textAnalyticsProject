You played the title role yourself at school \u2026 I wasn\u2019t very good! Compared with James Corden, I really wasn\u2019t very good. The play was specifically created for James Corden, wasn\u2019t it? We had a serious, high-minded season planned for summer 2011 at the National Theatre. We needed something that was purely entertaining. In one of our regular meetings we were knocking around ideas and I think I said James should come back. Sebastian Born [from the literary department] said what about Servant of Two Masters? It immediately resonated but I wasn\u2019t interested in a commedia dell\u2019arte production with James in harlequin gear. I\u2019d just worked with Richard Bean on Dion Boucicault\u2019s London Assurance, which he had secretly punched up in a big way \u2013 a lot of the best jokes in it were his. So I called him and asked him to do this. I said to think of Ealing comedy, Carry On films, Brighton in the 1950s, end of the pier, variety \u2026 The relationship of Venice to Turin [in Goldoni\u2019s play] is essentially the same as Brighton to London. Venice is for the dirty weekend, the carnival \u2013 it\u2019s where the wicked stuff goes on. All of that fell into place really quickly and Richard identified the early 60s for the era. James was in immediately. He was one of a large number of people who, if you\u2019re running a big theatre like the National, you\u2019re always anxious to bring back. I knew how funny and skilled he is on stage. Would it have surprised you if you\u2019d been told at the time that he would one day host an enormous chatshow in the US? Not at all. And it came about because Les Moonves [former CBS executive] came to see One Man, Two Guvnors on Broadway. How do you engineer this kind of stage farce? A lot of the physical and verbal humour go together. There\u2019s a sequence where James beats himself up as he\u2019s having an argument with himself. That started on the page \u2013 Richard had written that speech \u2013 and then James and [physical comedy director] Cal McCrystal worked out the physicality of that speech together. Cal, with his company Spymonkey, has been making this kind of comedy for a long time. It wouldn\u2019t be unfair to say he\u2019s like an accountant. The comedy has the precision of double-entry accounting. In rehearsals, Cal won\u2019t ever laugh. He is so deadpan. I remember him saying to Richard: \u201cThere\u2019s too many words here, it\u2019s like Ibsen.\u201d The NT Live version that is being streamed by the National this week is longer than the play was when it got to the West End and Broadway. When it was on at the National, it was quite long. We had a two-and-a-half-hour show in rehearsal but the laughter added half an hour. We gradually had to cut it back. Which moments of audience participation in the production stood out for you? Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t there for the Trump episode. James had a good eye for who to bring up on stage to help him in the scene with the trunk. I think he recognised Donald Trump from The Apprentice. Trump, from the way James tells it, couldn\u2019t have been happier to be dragged up on to the stage. James bantered with him, and the audience enjoyed it and rolled their eyes. That was Donald Trump when he was a relatively harmless blowhard. The first five minutes of One Man, Two Guvnors seem quite deliberately as if you\u2019re in Carry On-land. What I remember most vividly is those first minutes in the first preview, feeling the audience\u2019s jaws on the floor, as if they were asking: how can they be doing this? The moment they got it is in when James comes in, throws a peanut in the air and does a kind of dazzling thing that he and Cal worked out \u2013 falling backwards over a chair, catching the peanut in his mouth and springing straight back up again. There was a kind of collective decision in the audience: Oh, it\u2019s this kind of show! I\u2019ve never been involved in a show that harvested as many big laughs as regularly. There\u2019s no single individual that you can credit for that \u2013 it was a collective alchemy. I couldn\u2019t have done it without Cal or without Richard\u2019s extraordinary gift for individual jokes and building a whole comic sequence. A lot of people came to the National not knowing who James was. A lot of people were sceptical about James. But he is incredibly sympathetic and lovable. Above all, he is unbelievably skilled. I hope he\u2019ll come back one day \u2013 and I think he does, too. One Man, Two Guvnors is streaming on YouTube from 7pm BST on Thursday 2 April. Available until 9 April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
