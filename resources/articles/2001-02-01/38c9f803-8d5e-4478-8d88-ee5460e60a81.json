Much has changed since Nat Lofthouse helped Bolton last win the FA Cup in 1958, but even if the old trophy has lost part of its allure it still has the capacity to conjure up stories of heroes, villains and in Jurgen Sommer's case the downright unfortunate. In Lofthouse's day these all-Lancashire spats would have had Burnden Park bulging at the seams, but though the sentimentalists may not have it so good at the Reebok Stadium this was, nevertheless, the type of old-fashioned skirmish the competition needs if rumours of its demise are to be dispelled. That both sides went hell for leather on a toffee-pudding pitch owes much, of course, to Sam Allardyce and Graeme Souness craving a quick fix rather than further congestion to their springtime schedule. It is already complicated enough. Blackburn return to Bolton in the First Division on Friday and the double bill has now become a trilogy, with the final part to be acted out at Ewood Park on March 7. In the meantime spare a thought for Sommer. Football can be as unforgiving as it is unfair and, even though there were mitigating circumstances, his place in Bolton's annals is likely to be filed under \"best forgotten\" after he injured his thigh in the opening minutes and surrendered any chance he had to impress. It was never going to be more than a cameo role but when Sommer flew in from the United States last week to ease a crisis that had deprived Allardyce of three goalkeepers he had high hopes of playing well enough to find new employers in England. Instead, the New Yorker dented his employment prospects after watching David Dunn's free-kick sail past him as though he were admiring the Manhatten skyline from the Staten Island ferry. \"The goal was my fault but I just couldn't get off my bad leg,\" he said. \"I hold my hands up to accept the blame and if it wasn't for that mistake Bolton would be in the quarters. \"Usually with an injury like that I would have come off but we didn't have another goalkeeper. I figured an injured me in goal was better than a fit Robbie Elliott with the gloves.\" Given that handicap it was a wonder Bolton did not concede more against opponents who deserve credit for opting against negativity despite having Garry Flitcroft sent off for two studs-up challenges inside the opening nine minutes. That positive approach was rewarded by Dunn's goal five minutes before the interval. However, when Michael Ricketts poked in his 19th goal of the season on 63 minutes a third contest in 18 days was added to the agenda. Let battle recommence. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
