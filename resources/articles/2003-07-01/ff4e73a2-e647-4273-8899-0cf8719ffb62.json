Henmania has died out and plucky Tim will again spend the next 12 months playing the kind of reasonably good but not top-rate tennis that we all assume he is capable of for two weeks in grassy south London. In retrospect, Henman Hill, the unrealistic expectations, the whole palaver surrounding Britain's big Wimbledon hope can seem absurd. But it is more profound than this. It is actually 'Absurd with a capital A', a striking illustration of the human triumph over meaninglessness. The case of Henman enables us to move from Centre Court to Camus in one small step. To watch Henman battle past Tomas Zib, Michael Llodra, Robin Soderling and David Nalbandian before succumbing to S\u00e9bastien Grosjean is to observe the reality of what Camus was getting at in his discussion of the myth of Sisyphus. Sisyphus was condemned forever to push a giant boulder up a hill, only to see it roll to the bottom, demanding that he begin the labour all over again. Likewise, Henman's recurrent task is to push himself as far as possible up the hill of success at Wimbledon before he slips and the boulder returns to the bottom, where the next year he starts all over again in the first round. Of course, this is the life of all athletes, who must battle in whatever competition they are competing, get as far as they can, then start again in the next tournament. That is why, in a sense, it makes no difference if they win or lose. No matter how far up the hill they climb, even if it is to the top, at the end the slate is wiped clean and they must start the next competition at first base. It can appear to be ultimately meaningless whether one succeeds or fails because at the end of play everyone ends up back in the same position. Camus, however, was interested not only in athletes but in the human condition. The Absurdity he identified is the ultimate pointlessness of life in general. Life is a series of Sisyphean struggles in which success does not mark the start of a new and happy life, but the end of one process and the start of a new one. Life as a whole also follows the same pattern. We are nothing, we are born, we struggle up the hill of life, we die and we are nothing once more. This may all sound rather miserable, and indeed it raised for Camus the central question of why we should not just kill ourselves. But it is precisely at this point of despair that a curious, optimistic hope enters into his philosophy. We must embrace the struggle, willingly take on the task of Sisyphus, knowing its ultimate futility, but undertaking it nonetheless. Consider once more Henman and the crowds that cheer him won. To enter into the spirit of the sport, it is necessary to set aside for one moment the knowledge that the competition will soon become a memory, that we will not even be able to recall the names of the opponents Henman faced in matches that at the time engrossed us. We know and Henman knows that our present British men's number one will not rank as one of tennis's all-time greats. It is not in spite of these facts but because of them that the annual outbreak of Henmania takes on its heroic character. Henman is accepting his Sisyphean task in full knowledge of its ultimate futility and we cheer him on because to accept such a challenge is to look the absurdity of life in the eye and embrace it anyway. We can identify with Henman much more than we can with the all-conquering Williams sisters precisely because his situation more clearly reflects that of us all. We, too, must constantly muster the energy to perform the repeated tasks and one-off projects that shape our lives. We, too, must do so knowing that we are destined to end up as nothing, dust to dust, ashes to ashes. When Henman steps on to Centre Court and puts every fibre of his being into the hopeless task before him, we therefore see the best reflection of ourselves: someone who is not defeated by the knowledge that the boulder he is about to push will end up exactly where it is now, but who knows that he must push it for all he is worth or he is nothing at all. Henman is a hero not because of how well he does, but because he will be back next year and for as many years as he has the strength to resume his ultimately pointless task."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
