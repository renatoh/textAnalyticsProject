Born out of a desire to use tourism to help the South African people recover from the ravages of apartheid, the company's first brochure, depicting a smiling boy holding a picture of Nelson Mandela, focused on community tours. 'The brochure was very worthy but we didn't have any customers,' said Diski, a former history teacher and anti-apartheid activist, who cut his teeth organising similar holidays for anti-apartheid supporters keen to visit the free South Africa. The programme with Progressive Tours had initially been a great success but interest had waned. 'After two or three years most people who had wanted to go had been.' So Diski decided to change tack for his next brochure. 'We put a picture of Victoria Falls on the front; then things got going with a vengeance.' Diski set up the company with Mannie Brown, who had gained his experience running tour buses between Nairobi and Cape Town with AK-47s hidden under the seats for the ANC. 'He organised 40 crossings in eight years and was never discovered.' In the last six years Rainbow Tours has grown steadily and now sends more than 2,000 people away each year. The programme has also expanded to include the whole of southern Africa, Uganda, Rwanda, Ethiopia and the Indian Ocean. Diski has seen big changes in what people want to do with their holidays. 'They are so much more adventurous now. There is huge demand for places like Madagascar and in South Africa they want to go off the beaten track, to the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu Natal.' He is also seeing more families travelling and an unquenchable demand for safaris. In addition to organising the usual self-drive tours and safaris, Rainbow is still committed to sustainable tourism initiatives, such as promoting township tours in Cape Town, and makes financial contributions to community projects in each of the countries it features. Roger admits such responsible tourism initiatives only appeal to a small minority and are not big money spinners. 'I would say we have succeeded in spite of our interest in responsible tourism because it does cost money,' he says wryly. As the business took off, Diski gradually expanded his staff and now has seven people working for him. In the first year he was a one-man band but then his partner Judith de Witt, came onboard. 'When a tour company takes off there is so much to do. You either have to find a business partner, which would cost you half the business, or you bring your own partner in.' So what's it like living and working with your other half? 'We have autonomy. I look after southern Africa and Judith is responsible for our Indian Ocean programme. There are downsides. The business does overspill into our private life but if Judith didn't work in the business I would have to be here seven days a week. Our kids do say \"All you talk about is Rainbow Holidays\", but we have been on some great family holidays.' Having 'brilliant' staff with great knowledge of the destinations they offer has also helped Roger and Judith to slim down their hours to five and a half days a week from the seven days when they started. 'I still manage to pick up my child from primary school every day,' says Judith. So apart from their staff, what makes Rainbow so different from the numerous other tour operators offering Africa? Judith, who has been hard pushed to get a word in up until now, says: 'We spend a lot of time listening to what people want.' Roger adds: 'We will not sell people something that we do not feel is right for them.' Rainbow also eschews most of the big hotels in favour of small, owner-managed lodges. 'Places where we know the kind of reception the client will get.' It has proved a successful formula with Rainbow attracting the same customers back year after year, many of whom have recommended the company to friends and family. 'I had one client phone me up today who had just come back from one of our holidays. He's in his 50s and probably goes on six holidays a year. He said it was the best holiday he'd ever had.' Runner-up: Laskarina It was Kate Murdoch's love affair with Greece that led her to ditch a sales job with an American textile company, buy an electric typewriter and head to Spetses with her two-year-old daughter to write a bestseller and run a B&amp;B. While husband Ian split his time between Spetses and his ad agency job back home, Kate had a ball, taking clients to local tavernas for dinner while the book never got past the first chapter. The B&amp;B business gradually evolved into a fully fledged tour operation offering self-catering holidays in characterful properties on 11 of the more remote Greek islands and Ian started to work full time for the business. After five years, their idyllic island existence was rudely interrupted by a stern letter from Derbyshire council saying their daughter Katie, then seven, should be in full-time education. 'It had never occurred to me that she needed to be at school; I had already taught her to read and write.' Katie was forced to return to Britain during term time and her parents had to ensure that one of them was always in the country. Twenty-eight years after the company started offering B&amp;B in Spetses, it now sends around 10,000 people away annually, 65 per cent of whom are repeat clients. Kate and Ian are wary of the massmarket tour operators whose reps sell what they believe are 'overpriced excursions'. They call their own reps island managers. 'We pay them a proper salary so they're not beholden to get free food and drink and give objective advice.' Kate focuses on writing the brochure and dealing with customer issues while Ian concentrates on contracts and logistics. He keeps a close eye on weather reports because bad weather can halt ferries, leaving passengers stranded, a constant headache for the island managers who have become used to making contingency plans. 'I know the telephone number of the bar where the harbour policeman drinks: very important when things go wrong,' says Ian. Being together for 40 years means they act intuitively. 'We always know what the other's thinking just from a raised eyebrow or tone of voice.' It hasn't helped their social life though. 'We must have been utter bores, constantly discussing work,' says Kate. 'But we never get bored with each other because there's always something to fight about. And we can hold a board meeting in the bathroom.' This summer the company is moving from Wirksworth in Derbyshire to Bolney, West Sussex, following a merger with the Independent Aviation Group, which sells charter flights and winter holidays in Africa. Kate has been fighting cancer for the last two years so they've decided to step back from the day-to-day running of the business. The Murdochs' love of Greece has meant they have always been keen to give something back. They have raised money for a fire engine for the island of Samos, which suffered a devastating fire three years ago, and paid for vets to treat the local cat population. This passion has been recognised with a number of awards: they have been voted best tour operator eight times by Observer readers. They are honorary citizens of Symi and Leros, while in Halki Kate shares the title with Margaret Thatcher. 'She wasn't happy,' says Kate. 'I think she wanted a bigger island.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
