Thus the cult Atlantans\u2019 ninth studio album sees them reverting to the sound established when they were trashy garage rockers who once caused outrage in India with their onstage nudity. Produced by Sean Lennon \u2013 it features backing vocals from his mother, Yoko Ono, but unfortunately they are inaudible \u2013 Satan\u2019s Graffiti is more Captain Beefheart than the Beatles. However, a scuzzy cover of It Won\u2019t Be Long takes the Fab Four\u2019s 1963 sound on a trip into the wasted, psychedelic underground. Elsewhere, big riffs and a honking saxophone pile into swampy blues, moonshine country, rollicking rockabilly, glam racket and sometimes baffling cacophonies \u2013 but whenever things get too chaotic, their sharp songwriting pulls them back from the brink. Can\u2019t Hold On and Wayne are gloriously catchy, and Crystal Night is a truly sweet ballad, despite the recorded presence of what sounds like a chipmunk on helium."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
