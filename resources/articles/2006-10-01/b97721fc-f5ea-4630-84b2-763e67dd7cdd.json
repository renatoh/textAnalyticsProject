The club's innards were laid mercilessly bare on Sky's recent car-crash TV programme, Big Ron Manager, uncomfortably featuring Ron Atkinson as a managerial troubleshooter, but this story is not just about a football slump. Beneath, around and ahead of it, this is a tale about property, and the lucre in the land on which the football ground sits. Barry Fry, who arrived as manager in May 1996, took Peterborough down, then back up to the Second Division, via the play-offs, in 2000. The club's owner, Peter Boizot, the founder of Pizza Express, had backed Fry with a generosity not always evident in the toppings in his restaurant chain, but by 2003 he needed to sell. When the club finally did change hands the spin was that it had been saved from property developers, but before long Fry began to say openly that his friend Colin Hill, a property developer living in Ipswich, had in fact bought the club. Formally, the club documents state only that the new owner is the Wetmore Foundation, a company registered in Liechtenstein, whose \"ultimate controlling party\", the documents say, is \"unknown\". Just a few months later, the club and its ground were separated. Fry took over the club while Wetmore retained London Road, transferring it to another company, Peterborough United Holdings, for a price stated as \u00a33.5m. Fry's explanation of the separation is: \"Colin Hill is a shrewd businessman and he didn't want the football club because he said it would always lose money. I'm a football person, so I took it on.\" Some fans, led by the Posh Supporters Trust, were extremely concerned that the club had lost its ground, and are still protesting against the way that transfer was executed. A football ground for over a century, London Road was built up in the 1930s by the local council, and then by fans themselves, who raised money in the 1950s to improve the stands. True to the cap-doffing times, they asked for no stake or say in the club in return. In 1955, the council sold the ground to the club for a nominal amount, imposing careful conditions - that it must always be used for sport, and that if the club were ever to sell it the council must be given the option in writing to buy it back, and then have six months to consider it. However, in 2003, before the Wetmore Foundation transferred the ground to the holding company, it did not make a written offer to sell it to the council. The council's solicitor, Michelle Grove, has told the supporters trust that the club made only \"a word of mouth approach\". Council officials then met Colin Hill on October 10 2003, and four days later decided \"on the face of it\" not to exercise the right to buy the ground. The supporters trust is pragmatic, accepting where the club is now and backing MacAnthony's bid to take the club over, but they believe that when Hill transferred the ground, the council may have missed an opportunity to facilitate a modern community club. They are still asking why the required procedure was not followed, and the decision taken so quickly without referral to any elected councillors. \"The fans have a right to know,\" argues Peter Lloyd, the supporters trust chairman. \"If all options had been considered, a better outcome for the club might have been possible.\" That lament gained potency when, last year, the holding company owned by Wetmore submitted a planning application to build 96 two-bedroom and 39 one-bedroom flats on land behind the away end which was formerly owned by the club. At current, rising Peterborough property prices, the development could reap \u00a318m. The profit would all go to Wetmore, except for the cost of a 2,000-seat stand promised in the planning application. Meanwhile, the club has faltered. The latest accounts, to May 31 last year, show losses of \u00a34.8m and almost \u00a31m loaned by directors, including \u00a3500,000 by Fry. He stirred a row three years ago with the revelation that he was on a \u00a3230,000 salary package, and his loans earn a \"commercial\" rate of interest, but he says that to provide them he has sold a property he owned abroad and taken a \u00a3300,000 second mortgage on the house he lives in. He bought a house for his in-laws some years ago, but has deposited those deeds with the bank as security. \"I've got six kids and no money in the bank,\" he complains. \"I've had to borrow to keep the club going. It's a huge responsibility.\" Fry said that while he had been criticised for exposing the club on Big Ron Manager, the club was paid \u00a3212,000 for taking part. Watching on Sky, on which he has his own Overseas Property Channel, was the Irish wonderkid MacAnthony, who was looking for a football club to buy. Born in Dublin, where he says he was a \"Liverpool nut\", MacAnthony moved to Marbella and started his business on the cusp of the overseas property investment boom, and has lately stretched to 40 offices in 13 countries including new speculative terrain in Bulgaria and Romania. \"I've put sweat into my business,\" he told me, \"now I want a hobby. I saw passionate support on that TV programme, and Peterborough is a developing place. There is potential for a 25,000-seat stadium and with the right investment we can build this club to the Championship. From there, as Watford showed last season, anything is possible.\" MacAnthony told me his takeover is likely to involve clearing the club's debts, including the directors' loans, although Fry said he is unlikely to be repaid in full but at least hopes to reunite his mother-in-law's house with its deeds. MacAnthony, who has invested some money and become the club's chairman, is talking about making cash available for the manager, Keith Alexander, in January, and again next summer if Posh win promotion. If there is a property bonanza, however, it will not fall for the club, but the Wetmore Foundation. If the club leaves London Road, Hill will have a vacant site in the middle of a regen-erating city, 50 minutes on the fast train to London. Whether Hill will pay the club to surrender its lease, or the council to release its covenants, is, MacAnthony says, \"a conversation to be had down the line\". The prospect of the profits from selling the ground going mostly to a Liechtenstein-based company rather than the club angers many fans. MacAnthony, though, is a gifted salesman, and he can cheer them into believing that Posh, currently playing a long-ball game in front of around 4,000 miserable souls, can reach the Premiership and fill a shiny new ground. His role models are Reading and Wigan, but - here is a cautionary note - they have cost John Madejski \u00a340m and Dave Whelan \u00a360m. Two other new owners who promised the Premiership were Michael Knighton at Carlisle and George Reynolds at Darlington, and MacAnthony would do well to acquaint himself with the fate of those dreamers too.
