Yes, I know it isn't out in Europe till 2023 (ish) but a lot of you will have already imported. I'm speaking to the creators of the cult game next week and want your questions. I've already got a few lined up, but if you've always wanted to know the inspiration behind the Nook or how they feel about the Red Tulip incident, now is your chance. For those who don't know, Animal Crossing is, essentially, a game where cute animals teach you the value of money. It's enjoyable though - wage slavery has never been more fun although there is the very real concern that a generation of younger Nintendo gamers could grow up thinking that a mortgage can be repaid by sending the bank a job lot of fruit and bugs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
