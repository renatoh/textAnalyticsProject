The Chelsea manager said that his squad might have benefited last season from what he calls \u201cconfrontational leadership\u201d, even if he wondered whether many of them would have been able to handle his brand of it. But he feels that they have matured as a group and, before Sunday\u2019s Premier League visit to Hull City and despite recent setbacks, he offered the impression that he was content with how the season had gone. Chelsea have won the Capital One Cup and they are six points clear at the top of the table with one game in hand. The principal disappointment has been the Champions League last-16 exit against Paris Saint-Germain and Mourinho has suggested, on several occasions, that Chelsea have been the target of a media-driven campaign, which has led to bad decisions against them. \u201cThis season, I don\u2019t need confrontational leadership,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cLast season, I felt I needed it a few times but I didn\u2019t think there were many of them ready for that. But this season, I don\u2019t need that because in motivational terms, in responsibility terms, I am happy with everything. Things are going in the direction I want. \u201cObviously, you can say: \u2018But you lost in the Champions League and you lost against Bradford [in the FA Cup].\u2019 But, generally, the way they work, behave, live together, their motivations, their responsibilities, their frustrations, the way they react to the negative and positive moments, the absence of complacency: all this is going well. I just need to be present. I don\u2019t need to be a big leader, or even try to find strategies as a leader.\u201d Mourinho described confrontational leadership as being \u201cwhen you are ready to provoke your players, to try to create some conflict, with the intention to bring out the best from them\u201d. He said that he employed purely psychological means; he is not the type, for example, to pin a player up against the wall. \u201cI\u2019m not a big guy,\u201d Mourinho said, with a smile. \u201cHow might I do it? Criticise a player in the media \u2013 try to provoke a reaction from him of anger, of not being happy with his manager, of trying to show that I am not right.\u201d Mourinho recalled one of his more subtle strategies from his time at Internazionale, when he had Zlatan Ibrahimovic in his attack in 2008-09. He would show no emotion whenever Ibrahimovic scored and, as the striker became more and more determined to make him react, so he scored more and more incredible goals. \u201cWas I aware that it annoyed him? Annoyed, no. But provoke, yes,\u201d Mourinho said. Mourinho was publicly critical of Eden Hazard last season, saying that the winger was not \u201cready to sacrifice himself 100% for the team\u201d. This season, Hazard has been among the league\u2019s best players and Mourinho said that he deserved to be named as the Player of the Year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
