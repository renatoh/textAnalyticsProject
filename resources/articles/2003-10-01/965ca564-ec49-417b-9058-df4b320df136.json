The days of sticks of rock and garish illuminations could be numbered for the Conservatives as the party considers shunning seaside conference venues including Blackpool for dynamic cities such as Newcastle and Birmingham. Moving away from Blackpool, with its increasingly shabby grandeur, in favour of a large city with gleaming conference facilities would send out a signal that the Tories have not given up hope of winning in cities and Labour heartlands. Although Blackpool borough council expects the Tories to return in 2005, Conservative central office will only say it has made no decision on a return in two years, after a break in Bournemouth. Yesterday the party refused to discuss shunning seaside venues such as Blackpool, where Labour is also expected to return in 2005 if improvements are made to access and security. \"There's a lot of speculation,\" a spokesman said. \"We're in Blackpool now, having a great time. If only someone could sort out the weather.\" But urban centres offering up-to-date conference facilities, better security, and better transport links are becoming increasingly attractive. Newcastle, with its new music centre, Birmingham, with its 13,000-seat NEC, and Manchester - the host of last year's Commonwealth Games and next year's Labour spring conference - are among those likely to be considered. Steven Norris, the party's candidate for London mayor, warned the conference on Tuesday that \"unless we win in the cities ... we are never going to win in the country\", a theme reiterated by the former health secretary Stephen Dorrell as he reeled off a series of wounding statistics to a fringe meeting to show how the Tories had all but vanished from Britain's major cities. Spurning Blackpool would mean breaking with a tradition going back to 1936. But for all its history, delegates mutter about its drawbacks: public transport links are thin; the facilities are cramped; and the main conference venues - the Winter Gardens and the Imperial Hotel - are spread out. The cuisine, culture and shopping opportunities are limited, and Blackpool in October also offers fewer sunny picture opportunities than Brighton or Bournemouth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
