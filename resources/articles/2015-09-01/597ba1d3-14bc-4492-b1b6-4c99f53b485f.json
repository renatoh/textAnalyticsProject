The lectern was one of hundreds of objects, people and scenes sketched by the official election artist, Adam Dant, as he travelled to every corner of the UK in April and early May, attending rallies, policy launches, street corner meetings, publicity stunts and television debates. Dant has now incorporated his lightning sketches into one monumental sepia ink drawing, more than two metres long, which has just been unveiled at Speaker\u2019s House at the Palace of Westminster, to the members of the Parliamentary Art Collection who commissioned the work for \u00a317,000 - not counting his extensive travel expenses. In his fantastic imagined building called The Government Stable \u2013 a cross between a Victorian railway station and a cathedral \u2013 everything has been warehoused safely, including the upended campaign buses under flags and banners representing many cafe and pub pitstops on the road. There\u2019s no point in any of the candidates getting their magnifying glasses out, however: although their press officers, handlers and security officers appear, the politicians are represented only by the podiums on which they stood, the lecterns they read from, the megaphones they shouted through, or the props they clutched for the cameras. \u201cThere were many times when I\u2019d find myself standing in some car park in the middle of nowhere at eight in the morning with two journalists, but there was always something to draw,\u201d said Dant. \u201cThough there were times when you\u2019d ask yourself, \u2018Why is that person holding a fish?\u2019\u201d In his blog, Dant gave thanks for the rose coloured scarf worn by an NHS nurse, Agnes Brown, who introduced Ed Miliband at the Labour launch \u2013 a splash of colour in a sea of grey suits. He found some detail at every stop to delight his artist\u2019s eye. Those who followed the election in political-anorak detail may recognise Queen guitarist and animal rights campaigner Brian May in the shade of the Brighton bandstand, the mechanical diggers that flanked an ebullient Boris Johnson, a tower of fizzy drinks bottles that loomed over chancellor George Osborne on one of the mandatory factory visits and a sculptural pillar of ceramic insulators that stood by David Cameron when he visited the National Grid training centre in Newark. He noted that party-coloured daffodils flourished wherever the Liberal Democrats appeared. \u201cA spring election has certainly allowed the Lib Dems to \u2018luck out\u2019 florally,\u201d he wrote, and drew a rather forlorn flowerbed into which Nick Clegg had hammered a Lib Dem poster on a stake. He witnessed the hysteria provoked by Ukip at several events, and got his first view of \u201ca proper media scrum\u201d when Nigel Farage was mobbed in Westminster: \u201cThe tangle of photographers, cameramen, sound operators, notebook-clutching hacks, stepladders and boom microphones pulsates like a kind of outdoor-wear-clad jellyfish,\u201d he remarked. In his drawing Farage has completely disappeared from view. He was particularly struck by the Tory lectern, a scarred veteran of many election campaigns, which he imagined travelling in state in its own baize-lined box in the back of the battlebus. Dant, a former winner of the Jerwood Drawing prize, became the fourth official election artist since 2001, following Jonathan Yeo, David Godbold and the photographer Simon Roberts \u2013 who met Dant by chance when they both turned up for the reburial of Richard III in Leicester. His drawing now becomes part of the Parliamentary Art Collection, and will be on display to the public when Portcullis House opens on Saturday as part of the annual London Open House event. There will also be an online exhibition \u2013 with a key unravelling its myriad details \u2013 on the parliamentary website."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
