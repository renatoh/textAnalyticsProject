But the lengths (or, to be precise, distances) I will go to avoid the task are possibly exceptional. For instance, rather than complete a claim for a day return by rail to the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton this week, I decided to travel down from London by bike instead. Slightly mad, yes, but I reckon the 110-mile round trip probably only took an hour longer each way, when you factor in the full door-to-door time of going by train. And it was an unmissably glorious autumnal day. Possibly I'm not even a typical cyclist. I am always surprised when other cyclists talk about avoiding main roads and hunting out back routes. I actually like cycling in traffic, along the city's great thoroughfares. I find that after a holiday where I've been rolling along quiet rural roads, I experience an unexpected buzz when I get back to riding in town. But even I would agree with my more typical and sane fellow cyclists that there are some roads so unpleasant to ride on that we will literally go out of our way to find an alternative. Any underpass, for instance: invariably dirty, deafening and scary. Large, multi-lane gyratory systems: unsafe at any speed, as the man said. And urban dual carriageways. Take the Victoria Embankment in London, for instance. Either it's a speed-camera-free dragstrip, where City lawyers in Porsches vie with motorcycle couriers to see who can burn the most rubber and fry their brake pads in the quarter-mile till the next traffic light. Or it's chock-a-block with smoke-belching coaches and impatiently lane-switching taxicabs. Either way, toxic and hazardous to cyclists. But not this Sunday. In both directions, the entire length of this Thames riviera corniche will be closed to cars and open only to bikes. This is for the inaugural London Hovis Freewheel, a day when Londoners of all ages and types are encouraged to take to their bikes to enjoy a 14km car-free loop via what are normally some of central London's busiest roads. The event mimics similar events in Cape Town, New York, Berlin and beyond: the idea is to have a sort of more official, day-long Critical Mass, where cyclists truly own the town and get to ride around its landmarks at leisure, in safety and with a superb sense of gratified entitlement. Berlin's Sternfahrt (yes, Star Ride does sound more appealing to an Anglophone ear) started a decade ago with 20,000 riders; this year, it had a quarter of a million. As is so often the case with things cycling, the London Freewheel's organisers at Transport for London have discovered a suppressed demand. The event was planned for 30,000; but it has been heavily oversubscribed and 38,000 were allowed to register. I would guess the biggest headache for marshalls on the day could be policing the hordes of unregistered riders who will no doubt be eager to share the experience. Will I be there? In spirit definitely, but corporeally I will be taking part in a cyclocross race at Hillingdon, on a desolate patch of land hemmed in between the A40 and a link road to the M4 - an environment more reminiscent of JG Ballard's dystopic tale of auto-eroticism, Crash, than a utopian cycling excursion. I sometimes think it would pay to be more \"typical\": perhaps when they put on an even bigger, better event next year, I'll follow the crowd. Just don't ask me to register - did I mention I hate filling in forms?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
