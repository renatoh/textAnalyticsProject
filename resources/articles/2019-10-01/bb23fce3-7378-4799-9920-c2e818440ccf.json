Kathy Castor\u2019s letter to Pichai followed a report in the Guardian last week that revealed Google had made \u201csubstantial\u201d contributions to some of the most notorious climate deniers in Washington, despite the internet giant\u2019s insistence it supports political action to combat the crisis. The groups included the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which has actively sought to roll back Obama-era environmental protections and helped convince Donald Trump, the US president, to abandon the Paris Agreement. Google has said it supported the climate accord, but continued to offer financial backing to CEI and similarly-minded groups. \u201cIt is hard to overstate the detrimental impact groups like CEI have had on the climate debate in the United States since the early days of the Kyoto Protocol,\u201d Castor, a Democratic representative from Florida, said. \u201cBecause of their public and behind-the-scenes efforts to obfuscate and obstruct, we have lost critical time to cut greenhouse gas pollution and now face a shrinking window of opportunity to avert the worst impacts of climate change.\u201d Google has said that its support for CEI and other groups, including the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation, reflected support for the groups\u2019 \u201cstrong technology policies\u201d, and not their stance on the climate crisis. \u201cWe\u2019ve been extremely clear that Google\u2019s sponsorship doesn\u2019t mean that we endorse that organization\u2019s entire agenda \u2013 we may disagree strongly on some issues,\u201d a Google spokesperson told the Guardian about its donations. But in her letter to Pichai, Castor, who is chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, said there was no way to distinguish their support from other issues. \u201cIt is impossible to separate your support for one sliver of CEI from the whole. Your financial contributions support the organization\u2019s infrastructure, augment its political influence, and, in turn, legitimize all of its activities \u2013 not just the ones you like,\u201d she wrote. Google declined to offer new comment on the letter, and referred to previous statements on the issue. Castor closed her letter by pointing to Google\u2019s own website, and its declaration that the company was striving to \u201cbuild sustainability into everything we do\u201d. \u201cI urge you to apply this mantra when you make decisions about which thinktanks and organizations to support in the future,\u201d she said. It was not the only public response to the Guardian\u2019s report last week, which was part of a broader investigation into the fossil fuel industry, the structures behind it, and the climate emergency. Activists with Extinction Rebellion staged a protest in front of Google\u2019s London headquarters on Wednesday, with more than 100 mothers \u2013 and babies \u2013 staging a \u201cnurse-in\u201d to protest the company\u2019s funding of climate deniers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
