The man who for two years has been haunted by the possibility of a premature end to his time in tennis has proved with his triumph at the RCA Championships that not only is he a winner again, but a new kind of winner. His 6-7, 6-4, 6-4 triumph in the final over Felix Mantilla suggested that the new-style Rusedski can last five successive hard days without his body wearing down, and that he has incorporated changes into his play without his game breaking up. It also means, incredibly, that he could again be a threat at the US Open. Rusedski would go further than this. \"That's the one I really want to win,\" he said, as if the dream were revived. \"This victory was very sweet, but my eyes are on the Open now.\" That may sound fanciful for a man who may still be unseeded, who not long ago had such a serious back injury, and who does not know yet whether there is to be an adverse reaction to his efforts of the past two weeks. But Rusedski will remind you that very few players have beaten the top three in the world within a fortnight, and that when he reached the final of the US Open five years ago he was unseeded then too. But he is not the master blaster he was then. Rusedski only occasionally uses the cannonball serve that once struck the world-record 149mph delivery he still proudly advertises on his T-shirt at press conferences. In some ways it is an out-dated image that he projects. \"I can mix it between a slice, a kick or flat. I can change the speed and have a lot of variety. That's what the key is, to keep them off balance,\" he said after beating Mantilla for the first time in three attempts. \"If I hit them all hard, they [opponents] are going to get a rhythm. So that's the key, and to back it up with volleys.\" If he can also hit all four corners of the two service courts, as he frequently does, then the effect can be almost as devastating as the brute speed of his youth. Just occasionally, under pressure, the 28-year-old's volleys let him down, particularly the angled short one he is developing as another device for opening up the court, and from time to time there are splutters of double faults. But to have incorporated a lower service toss and alterations to footwork, at an age when usually it is impossible to jump out of well-worn grooves, is little short of a miracle. As for the seeding, or lack of it, Rusedski says he does not care. \"I don't think anybody is going to want to see my name next to theirs in the first round, whoever it is,\" he said. All that remains is to wait and see how he reacts this week. He is travelling to Long Island this week but the best guess is he will not play. If the body has time to recover, then Rusedski may be reborn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
