England will go to Paris this weekend as guaranteed champions courtesy of Scotland\u2019s 29-18 victory over France at Murrayfield on Sunday on Sunday. It is England\u2019s first championship crown since 2011 but Jones, whose side beat Wales 25-21 on Saturday, has stressed that a clean sweep remains the ultimate goal. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously nice to win the championship but as a team we feel we haven\u2019t yet achieved what we want,\u201d said Jones, having steered his squad to the trophy at the first attempt. \u201cIf we prepare well, we\u2019ll do the business. We\u2019ll go to Paris confident. France are capable of some sublime moments. We just have to make sure there aren\u2019t too many of them.\u201d Given England failed to make it out of their pool at last year\u2019s World Cup, the turnaround under Jones\u2019s stewardship has been particularly striking. The Australian insisted, however, that his players deserved the bulk of the credit and singled out the former captain, Chris Robshaw, as his player of the tournament so far. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fantastic achievement by the team. If you look at the squad it\u2019s still very much the same as the World Cup. I think Robshaw has been absolutely outstanding \u2026 to go from where he was at the end of the World Cup to where he is now is a fine achievement. He\u2019s been colossal for us. Wales couldn\u2019t live with us for the first 40 minutes. If we can extend that out to 60 or 70 minutes, we\u2019re going to be a bloody good team.\u201d Jones claims he has simply tried to \u201cmake the players more responsible, create a style of game that suits the resources we\u2019ve got and try and get the players to enjoy it\u201d. His determination to jolt the squad out of their individual comfort zones has also been vital, with his appointment of Dylan Hartley as captain also triumphantly vindicated. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know whether to shake hands or give each other a hug, so we shook hands,\u201d said Jones. After sharing \u201ca couple of beers\u201d at their Bagshot hotel on Sunday night the squad\u2019s attention will swiftly turn to Saturday night\u2019s concluding game at Stade de France. The scrum-half Ben Youngs, among the survivors from the 2011 side chasing a grand slam, who were thumped in their final game in Ireland, is determined to avoid such a \u201cbittersweet\u201d experience. \u201cWe want to win it the right way,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel that weird sensation again. We just have to approach it as another game. If you get too hyped up and over-think it you might freeze and it will be doubly disappointing.\u201d The Wales prop Tomas Francis could be facing a lengthy ban after being cited on Sunday for making contact with Dan Cole\u2019s eye area late in the game at Twickenham. The match citing commissioner, John Cole, also issued a formal warning to the England back-row James Haskell for a dangerous \u201cneck roll\u201d tackle. Joe Marler should be available for Paris after avoiding further disciplinary censure for calling Wales\u2019s Samson Lee \u201cGypsy boy\u201d. The comment was heard over the referee Craig Joubert\u2019s microphone. The Rugby Football Union said in a statement that Marler had apologised to Lee at half-time and had been \u201creminded by Eddie of his responsibilities as an England player after the game\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
