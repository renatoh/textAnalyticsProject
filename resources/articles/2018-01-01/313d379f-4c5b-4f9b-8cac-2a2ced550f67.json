Exeter came north in search of a win. A losing bonus point left them as clubhouse leaders in the race for a runners-up spot but they knew it would not be enough. \u201cIt is hard to talk,\u201d said Rob Baxter, their director of rugby. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed, not because we lost or because this European campaign has slipped away from us, but we weren\u2019t as good as we needed to be.\u201d Glasgow\u2019s interest in this competition had long since expired but for a side of this class to finish a campaign with six defeats from six would have been absurd and they played as if they knew it. They welcomed back a host of international-calibre backs, who tormented their visitors with a fraction of the ball hogged by Exeter. Indeed, Hogg was the word. Scotland\u2019s full-back Stuart returned in full regalia to announce his fitness for Scotland\u2019s Six Nations campaign with one of a series of dazzling performances from the Scottish backs, complemented by hard accuracy in the loose by their young, mobile forwards. Glasgow, like Scotland, are labouring under something of an injury crisis and lost four more, including George Turner and Alex Dunbar in the first quarter, but it did not disrupt the side, bar a certain looseness at the set piece. Exeter, realistically, needed to win with a bonus point. It is a dangerous directive for any side but particularly one having to travel the length of these isles to the frozen north and the kind of artificial pitch they have never particularly enjoyed. Their mission was further complicated by a classic quicksilver raid by Glasgow after barely a minute. Finn Russell\u2019s footwork breached the line, whereupon the ball was worked smartly via George Horne to Hogg. Seven points, no argument. But Exeter are nothing if not patient, working phases like few others. Patient but strangely careless here too, they coughed up the ball time and again as they hammered away. The pattern was set, the visitors\u2019 advantage in possession and territory overwhelming. It was not until a minute before the break that Exeter finally battered over for their first try. Glasgow overthrew a lineout, which the tireless Luke Cowan-Dickie swooped on, setting in motion yet another set of phases. This was completed by the power of Exeter\u2019s back row round the fringes, where Sam Simmonds drove over to draw Exeter level. The game was to turn on a marginal decision in the third quarter. At first no one had noticed when Russell\u2019s pass scudded into touch with two front-row forwards outside him. Nic White\u2019s tackle had seemed innocuous enough but the replays piqued the interest of the referee, who decided with the TMO that White\u2019s arm had batted the ball into touch deliberately. It was delicate call but once it was made the punishments cascaded \u2013 penalty try and a yellow card for White. To describe what followed as further consequence would be churlish indeed. Glasgow took the bonus point with two tries in as many minutes of divine construction. If Exeter had had 16 on the field they would surely have been confounded. On the hour Tommy Seymour, another returning international, was released from his 22. The support running of Glasgow\u2019s three-quarters was unanswerable, Russell, Hogg and George Horne combining to send Seymour over. Astounding, but the Warriors were not finished. From the next play, Hogg broke and more support \u2013 from Seymour and both Hornes, Peter and George \u2013 put Matt Fagerson in for Glasgow\u2019s fourth and a 28-7 lead. That it was not the end of the story is of some consolation to the English and their champions. They responded with two tries before the last 10 minutes. \u2013 Don Armand finished after a break by Joe Simmonds before Ian Whitten rounded off a flowing move to pull the Chiefs back to within seven. They did not threaten again. Overwhelming possession had yielded precious little, undone by opponents who needed but a few morsels with which to work their magic. It felt like an apt summary of English travails in Europe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
