Inevitably, I have been wondering how Sven will keep the injured ones entertained. When you're a kid and you fall over at home (for example by cutting your own calf muscle with a bread knife because you're so desperate to get out of rounders), your mum writes a note to get you out of it. Failing that, you write one yourself. Footballers will have a note, probably typed in gold lettering, from the club physio instead, stating how much their foot hurts or whatever. But having delivered the note, what will they do with themselves while their fit team-mates are running between cones and stepping really fast through tyres? At school they would have sat out a PE lesson on a plastic chair brought down to the playing field from the assembly hall, then idly stab worms with their compass. Somehow I can't see that happening at Bisham Abbey (compasses are not allowed 48 hours before a game), so when all the talk of what went wrong in the World Cup (we lost) has been done, what will Sven lay on to keep those crocked players busy? A top-secret dossier fell on my desk this morning. It outlines Sven's plans to keep the broken players occupied, so I thought I would share it with you. There was also a shopping list inside (eggs, butter, hankies, bin bags, Dairy Lea Triangles). The duties are as follows: 1 Washing of England kit If it's Nicky Barmby or Michael Owen out injured, they're not allowed to partake in this chore, as they're so small there's always the chance that they could fall into the upright washing machine with the clothes, then come out even shorter than they were before they went in, which would render them useless other than as mascots. Instead, they separate blues from whites. Problems occur when someone points out that there's some red bits on the tops and on the socks. At the risk of England training in pink, it is decided to leave this to the experts, ie Pauline Fowler. 2 Folding of England kit After a five-minute induction course in how to fold an item of casual clothing and do that thing with socks which makes them stay together, the kit man gets a chance to put his feet up and have some cake while two players, working \"as a team\", fold tracksuits. All-weather training tops prove to be a problem as the material \"just doesn't want to fold, gaffer!\" 3 Preparing lunch Bisham Abbey knocks up a good sandwich, but why waste money on silver-service staff when a couple of injured lads can make lunch for the squad instead? Scholesy nips down to Asda for bottled water, tins of tuna, salad cream, a multi-pack of crisps and eight loaves of bread, a bit like Jesus only he swapped the crisps for wine. Leftovers are liquidised into soup at teatime. 4 Maintaining the grounds Bisham Abbey is a posh place and is set in something like four million acres of land. There are lakes and little bushes and wooden bridges (not to be confused with Wayne Bridges), plenty of hedges and a few rockeries with those little stones in. Anyway, the gardener is on holiday so Sven has outlined gardening duties such as trimming hedges into football shapes, watering the plants and fishing out supermarket trolleys or old shoes from the lake. 5 Housekeeping Sven is giving the chambermaids an afternoon off, so it is up to the injured players to make their own beds, and those of the fit players, too. As footballers have never had to do a thing for themselves, they do not know how to pull up a sheet and duvet and tuck things in, so one of them rings his mum. He pays her \u00a3102,000 for the trouble. \"That's an afternoon's rate, innit?\" he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
