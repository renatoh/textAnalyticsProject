Keegan has said he will retire at the end of next season but he also recently indicated he might leave earlier. \"There has to be clarity,\" James said. \"As it stands there is a cloud as to when he leaves. There is an area of uncertainty.\" He added: \"We're going for Europe and, if we get there, will it influence the manager's decision or the club's decision? Europe's a big step for the club so do you want a man holding the reins when he is only going to be here one year?\" Erik Edman was yesterday awarded \u20ac180,000 (\u00a3124,000) plus costs by a Dutch football federation [KNVB] tribunal considering his transfer from Heerenveen to Tottenham last summer. The Sweden international full-back had complained to the KNVB after a third of the fee Spurs paid Heerenveen went to agents. Edman lodged his complaint after missing out on his entitlement to a 20% cut of the fee stated in his contract. Heerenveen claimed he had agreed to waive this share during 11th-hour talks with them before the transfer, but the court yesterday found partly in favour of the player. \"Edman has been awarded \u20ac180,000 from the profit Heerenveen made on the transfer,\" said the club's chairman Riemer van der Velde in a statement. \"Besides that Heerenveen has to pay a part of Edman's costs.\" Dietmar Hamann will sign a new one-year contract at Liverpool with an option for a further 12 months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
