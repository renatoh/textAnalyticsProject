The confines of our world were tight and strictly \u2013 sometimes literally \u2013 policed, but my sisters and I didn\u2019t notice. We would dander round \u201cthe block\u201d to the corner shop. When we weren\u2019t allowed to leave the garden, we would climb the big cypress tree and sit, deliciously cocooned, to watch for something to happen. We went every week to Tullycarnet library, where each of us had nine library cards. We read indiscriminately but loved long series best \u2013 Little House on the Prairie, Drina ballerina, The Dark Is Rising, the Chrestomanci books. The only \u201cBelfast\u201d stories I read were Joan Lingard\u2019s Kevin and Sadie books, about love across the barricades. I devoured them, but they might as well have belonged to another realm; parts of the city we would never set foot in. From an early age, I was conscious that there were places you just didn\u2019t go. But life never felt small because my sisters and I lived almost entirely in worlds of our own making \u2013 sagas of love and betrayal that would careen on for months, and generations. Years later, I read about the Bront\u00eb siblings and their worlds of Angria and Gondal with a rush of love and recognition. Books were the constant in our lives. The real world swelled and contracted in a way that felt utterly arbitrary. The weekends when you couldn\u2019t drive across town to see the friends you\u2019d planned to. The summers when the city went into lockdown, or up in flames. You would see Belfast on the news, and although you\u2019d occasionally recognise something, mostly it felt another place entirely. The newsreaders would rarely even say it right: Bel-fahst, the stress on an elongated second syllable, rather than Bell-fast. Penpals asked about life in a war zone, and we apologised for disappointing them. And yet. There was my schoolfriend\u2019s father, murdered because his catering firm supplied the Royal Ulster Constabulary canteen. The November night we went into town to busk for Children in Need and got stuck in a multistorey carpark where there was believed to be a bomb \u2013 I can still see the soldier\u2019s distorted face as he ran towards us, swearing. The bomb scare at Olympia Leisure Centre, when we were bundled from the swimming pool, wrapped shivering in tinfoil blankets, while the sniffer dogs went in. The sound of helicopters in the sky, until some nights you\u2019d find it hard to sleep without them. But how to reconcile this? How to acknowledge the fact that you didn\u2019t live an entirely normal life, at least not in an entirely normal place, while conscious of the privilege of being sheltered from most of it? For a young writer, it feels like a curse, coming from a notorious place. You feel the weight of it like a stone on your chest, crushing other stories out of you. How do you begin your stories when you\u2019re aware that there are more urgent, more devastating stories about that place to be told? It took years to believe that the stories I had of Belfast were in any way worth the telling. \u2022 Being Various: New Irish Short Stories edited by Lucy Caldwell is published by Faber."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
