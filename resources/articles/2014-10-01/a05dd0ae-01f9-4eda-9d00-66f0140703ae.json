So much for narratives. Thanks for following along with the first half of our MLB Playoff double-header here at the Guardian. That\u2019ll do it from me, but I recommend you jump over to David Lengel\u2019s coverage of ALDS Game 3 between the LA Angels vs the Kansas City Royals to see who the Orioles will face in the ALCS, which is about to kick off! Ciao! The Baltimore Orioles are headed to the American League Championship Series! The Detroit Tigers season is over! And Buck Showalter\u2019s intentional walk sets up the game-ending double play. I guess that\u2019s what I don\u2019t manage. Orioles 2-1 Tigers, top 9th Perez foul tips pitch one. 0-1. Then he grounds into a double play! Game over! Orioles win! Orioles 2-1 Tigers, top 9th Nick Castellanos is apparently Barry Bonds. I guess? And Hernan Perez is pinch-hitting for Romine? There\u2019s all sorts of over-managing going on here. Orioles 2-1 Tigers, top 9th Castellanos is up, and the Orioles... intentionally walk him? Nick Castellanos? REALLY Showalter? Orioles 2-1 Tigers, top 9th That almost went out. Holy heck. J.D. Martinez is at second, nobody out. Holaday is up and you gotta expect a bunt. He fakes bunt and tries to swing first. Strike one. He attempts a real bunt, and fouls it off. 0-2 now and gotta think the bunt is off now. Next pitch? Ball one. 1-2. Next pitch, Holaday swings and misses for the first out. Orioles 2-1 Tigers, top 9th J.D. Martinez takes a strike on the outside corner. 0-1. Second pitch? J.D. fouls it off and it\u2019s 0-2 quickly. And the next pitch? He hits one off the wall and THAT\u2019S a double! VICTOR MARTINEZ SCORES! Orioles 2-0 Tigers, bottom 9th Baltimore\u2019s Zach Britton needs to get two Martinezes out and then a Holaday to clinch an ALCS appearance. First up Victor. Pitch one? Strike. 0-1. Next pitch? Ball one. 1-1. Martinez takes a 98 mph fastball for a strike and JESUS what a pitch by Britton. How the heck does anyone figure that out? Well, Victor Martinez is one of the smartest hitters in the game and he lines Britton\u2019s pitch into the outfield and Adam Jones can\u2019t make the play! Leadoff double! Orioles 2-0 Tigers, top 9th Hundley strikes out. Well that was quick. Can the Tigers make an insane comeback? All the cool clubs are doing it. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, top 9th (for real this time) David Lough fouls out. J.J. Hardy hits a long flyball out. Maybe a home run in a different climate, different park. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, bottom 8th This about sums up Detroit right now. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, top 9th Joe Nathan is coming out, not to close things out for Detroit, just to keep the deficit at two runs. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, bottom 8th Miguel Cabrera is up next. The fans would have preferred to see him with someone on, but if he can get on for Victor Martinez... Well with these MLB playoffs, it\u2019s never over until it\u2019s over. This inning is over though, he grounds out to Schoop at shortstop. Three outs for Detroit. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, bottom 8th Torii Hunter in what could, maybe, might be his last at-bat in a Tigers uniform or like ever is up now with two out and no one on. He grounds out to Schoop. Make that four outs. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, bottom 8th Andrew Miller is back out there, he will face Ian Kinsler here. Kinsler hits one just fair to third and Flaherty makes a *great* throw to get him out at first. The Tigers have five outs left to play with before their season dies. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, top 8th NEVER MIND! Price picks Cruz off with the very next throw! Possibly. Buck Showalter stalls to see if the Orioles want to challenge it yeah or nah. And the answer is \u201cnah.\u201d To the bottom of the 8th! Orioles 2-0 Tigers, top 8th Here\u2019s Nelson Cruz with a runner on. I think I\u2019ve seen this movie before. David Price slows things down to a crawl, like a chopped and screwed remix crawl here, which works. Price induces Cruz into a would-be double play but Kinsler makes a bad throw to first and Cabrera can\u2019t reel it in. So it\u2019s only a single out. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, top 8th David Price walks Adam Jones. Okay, now Ausmus has to worry about bringing in a reliever here. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, top 8th Here\u2019s David Price again, because Ausmus is not going to the bullpen here because why the heck would you. Pearce flies out to Ezequiel Carrera who is in CF after the Davis pinch-hitting thing. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, top 8th *faves* Orioles 2-0 Tigers, bottom 7th Switch-hitting Romine is up now, hitting from the right side. This feels very much like Detroit\u2019s best chance. On 2-1 Romine swings and misses and on the next pitch he grounds back to Miller to who hits into a force to erase Castellanos at second. Rajai Davis is here to pinch-hit. Or rather pinch-immediately ground out to end the inning. Tigers are now six outs away from elimination. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, bottom 7th Lefty Andrew Miller has had an amazing season in relief, looking nothing like the wild, lanky pitcher I used to call \u201cThe Walking Dude\u201d during his early Red Sox tenure. He\u2019ll be facing the potential tying run. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, bottom 7th Castellanos is up next to face Bud Norris who is probably on a short leash. Castellanos works a full count here, this could be a key at-bat here. Maybe the final batter Norris faces with Andrew Miller ready. Norris misses with a slider to put him on and here comes Buck Showalter. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, bottom 7th Brian Holaday pops out, hard to be too mad at that considering he\u2019s having a Dante Hicks \u201cI\u2019m not even supposed to be here today\u201d experience. Seventh Inning Stretch Orioles 2-0 Tigers, top 7th Schoop steals second, so he\u2019s in scoring position on what was a strike to Markakis. A close play. It doesn\u2019t matter Markakis strikes out. Agreed. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, top 7th Schoop hits into a force that erases Flaherty. Nick Markakis is up with two down. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, top 7th David Price is back on out out there to face the bottom of the Baltimore order. He gets Hundley to pop out but Flaherty hits a single with one out. Another run here could be huge considering Baltimore\u2019s bullpen. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, bottom 6th That would be Victor Martinez, of course, other Martinez, that would be J.D. is up now. J.D. grounds out to short and that\u2019s nine pitches and three outs and it\u2019s on to the seventh. Time is growing short in Detroit. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, bottom 6th Martinez grounds into the shift. No need to test defensive replacement David Lough in the outfield for the incredibly bad Delmon Young. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, bottom 6th Miguel Cabrera grounds on Norris\u2019s very first pitch of the inning. Not what Detroit needed there. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, top 6th J.J. Hardy takes strike three to end the inning. Much appreciated email from James Galloway: When are these batters going to realise that hitting is not about muscle? It\u2019s simple physics. Calculate the velocity, V, in relation to the trajectory, T, in which gravity, G, of course, remains a constant. But yeah, bring on the Tigers\u2019 bullpen please. I am now trying to imagine major league hitters doing math during at-bats and the imagery is making me laugh. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, top 6th Things look real real dicey now for Detroit. Delmon Young hits a comebacker to Price for the second out. Orioles 2-0 Tigers, top 6th With Nelson Cruz on the plate, Holaday makes a great block on a Price offering that could have easily gone for a wild pitch. It\u2019s for naught, Nelson Cruz hits a home run on the very next pitch and the Orioles have the lead! Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 6th Pearce flies out for the first out of the inning. Adam Jones is up next and... Tries to bunt? O-kay. It goes foul. 0-1. I don\u2019t quite know what was up with that but I didn\u2019t like it. Next pitch, Jones hits a solid single. He\u2019s adapted his game to Price and the ballpark clearly. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 5th Brian Holaday comes in, not an ideal spot for an inexperienced catcher who hasn\u2019t really worked with David Price much but sometimes you gotta think beyond the game. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 6th I\u2019m starting to feel like a Samuel Beckett protagonist here. It\u2019s a bit lonely, I\u2019m not going to lie. I want the Tigers bullpen to come in and give me some entertainment. Price is back out for another inning to face Pearce and... Oof, Alex Avila gets hit by a foul tip. Not good for someone who has already had a concussion and, yes, the Tigers are taking him out of the game. This is the right move. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 5th Ian Kinsler pops up for what should be the final out it it weren\u2019t for that pesky Don Kelly. Instead Norris will have to face Torii Hunter... Who also pops out. The wild pitch doesn\u2019t hurt. onto the sixth inning! Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 5th And when it comes back Don Kelly is on first. But it also says that he struck out. I think that\u2019s what happened with my signal. The concept of the result of this play completely broke it. GameDay says he reached first on a wild pitch after striking out swinging. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 5th Romine was definitely out this time, no review needed. And hey is that activity in the Tigers bullpen? Okay. It\u2019s Anibal Sanchez which is, the only reliable option there really. Don Kelly, in the middle of everything today so far, is up next. On a 2-2 pitch... my coverage cuts out. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 5th It\u2019s definitely a pitching duel: Romine starts off the bottom of the fifth, and Norris gets him to ground out. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 5th Nick More Cake Please? He\u2019s a bit more of a threat at the plate. He works a 3-2 pitch, that third ball at 95mph. On 3-2 he hits a hard-hit liner but foul. Price throws a changeup rather than a fastball, but Markakis fouls that off too. And then Markakis looks at strike three. We\u2019re halfway through a non-extra inning affair and it\u2019s still scoreless here! Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 5th Comerica sounds a bit louder now. Not sure if it\u2019ll be a factor per se, but it\u2019s a much better atmosphere than earlier in the game. Ryan Flaherty will be leading off against David Price which gives me an opportunity to post this because it makes me laugh: What hath the Endless Derek Jeter Retirement Tour wrought? Flaherty grounds out and then Schoop flies out. The bottom of the O\u2019s order: still not scary. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 4th Nick Castellanos is on with two out and nobody on.. and he strikes out swinging on a slider. That\u2019s Bud Norris\u2019s fifth strikeout of the game. We have an official pitcher\u2019s duel ladies and gentlemen. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 4th Bud Norris strikes out Alex Avila on a 3-2 count and pumps his fist. He\u2019s... He\u2019s pitching really well? Fourth k. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 4th J.D. Martinez swings at the first pitch he sees in the bottom of the inning and that will be a groundball back to the pitcher. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 4th Don Kelly just got his revenge on the Orioles for this: Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 4th Hundley hits a reeeeeeal long scary ball, but Kelly catches it to end the inning. A bit of a threat there, but we remain scoreless. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 4th Price falls behind J.J. Hardy 3-0 before painting the corner on a nice strike to make it 3-1. Price\u2019s next pitch though is right down the middle but Hardy fouls it off. On 3-2, Hardy hits it to Don Kelly in centerfield. Great work from Price to fight back. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 4th Price strikes out Delmon Young which should really be the only outcome to that match-up ever. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 4th David Price facing Nelson Cruz to start the fourth. Price falls behind 2-0, a dangerous spot for Cruz who hits one towards rightfield. Not the worst outcome there, honestly. Schoop sits on it Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 3rd And there\u2019s Victor Martinez with an open base with runners on second and third. Hard to see Vic getting anything to hit here. Or not, Norris gets ahead 1-2 on Martinez, giving him some pitches to work with. Martinez doesn\u2019t chase on a ball outside for 2-2, then fouls off Norris\u2019s next pitch, and the next. Man what a hitter. Then he hits a groundball foul. Seventh pitch of the at-bat. Gotta think Vic is in command now. Eighth pitch? Fouled off again. The count is STILL 2-2. What a battle... but Martinez finally hits a routine flyball to Jones on the ninth pitch to end the inning. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 3rd Well there\u2019s a bit of controversy again with Schoop, who dropped the ball and then obstructed Kelly from getting back to the bag. The Tigers bench is livid but the call stands. Kelly is out at second but Hunter is on first with two outs. Cabrera grounds out... but J.J. Hardy decides to try the out on second even with the slow-footed Miggy on and throws it away and everybody is safe! Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 3rd He\u2019s sorta the David Eckstein/Nick Punto of the Tigers for doing things like, well, taking second base on a wild pitch to get into scoring position for Torii \u201cTolerance Ambassador\u201d Hunter. Oh and THEN Kelly gets thrown out at second. That\u2019s also kinda gritty. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 3rd Norris falls behind Kinsler 2-0, he\u2019s just not going to swing at anything Bud is slinging in there is he? Or he could foul off the next pitch. I should stop predicting, my predictions only work when I\u2019m not blogging. Kinsler takes the next pitch for a ball but then hits a medium depth flyball for the first out here. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 3rd Oh hey Don Kelly. He\u2019s the grittiest! And the light-hitting ninth man in the order gets a base hit off the second pitch he sees. Well that serves me for being sarcastic. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 3rd Jones pops out and another easy inning from Price. Bottom of the third! I\u2019m going to once again mention that you can tweet @HunterFelt or email me at Hunter.Felt@theguardian.com and I\u2019ll include your baseball related thoughts (for those of you starting to creep in as the early afternoon NFL games start to wrap up). Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 3rd Markakis grounds out to second and David Price is still dealing, probably should be having a no-hitter going. I\u2019m not just saying that because of my earlier prediction. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 3rd The fact that I\u2019m continually mixing up Flaherty and Romine is a commentary on the fact that the infielders on both teams are rather anonymous journeymen types and absolutely NOT a sign that I have no caffeine in my system right now. ANYWAY. After making a great play last inning, Jonathan \u201cSalt-n-Pepa Song Now In Your Head\u201d Schoop flies out for the first out of the third. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 2nd Nope. Play stands, onto the third. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 2nd Romine might be safe here but it\u2019s too close to call, hard to see the call being reversed on this. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 2nd Romine tries to bunt for a hit to get that runner home, but Schoop JUST gets the out at first. OR does he? There\u2019s going to be a review here. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 2nd The Tigers are going to run on Delmon Young\u2019s below average everything in the outfield, I have to imagine. Runner in scoring position with just one out for Castellanos who hits a decent lengthed flyball for the second out, but Avila does make it to third on the play. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 2nd Or maybe they\u2019ll tee off now. Alex Avila hits a double off the first pitch he sees. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 2nd Here\u2019s Bud Norris again. Not a bad first inning but, well, his name is still Bud. Once I figure out a proper \u201ccall the All-Star Game a tie\u201d joke he\u2019s gonna get so burned. Rejuvenated Astros cast-off J.D. Martinez is up first in this inning. He looks at a Norris fastball for a strike. Norris seems to be living dangerously here, I wonder if they\u2019ll tee off of him on the second time throughout the order. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 2nd And Ryan Flaherty lines out to second to the end the inning. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 2nd Hundley hits into what could be a double play, but the Tigers settle for getting the force on second. That\u2019s two out with one on for the Orioles. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 2nd J.J. Hardy reaches on an error on Nick Castellanos. Or okay they\u2019re calling that a single for the first hit of the game. Oh for sure man. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 2nd Delmon Young, who is always great in the postseason, and terrible in every other situation, is up to lead off the inning. Young falls behind 0-2 almost immediately, which is very Delmon Young of him, and then takes a ball before swinging at a changeup away. The Tigers should know how to pitch him considering the time he spent playing for Detroit. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 1st MVP chants for Victor Martinez, who isn\u2019t the league MVP of course, but probably the team MVP. HE doesn\u2019t strike out a lot unless I totally just jinxed him. Yep, Victor looks at a strike three. Well can\u2019t argue with Norris\u2019s results if you\u2019re a Baltimore fan. Onto the second! Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 1st And that\u2019s a runner on for Miguel Cabrera. The guy can hit a bit. Can\u2019t run worth a lick, no longer in MVP form, but he\u2019s still dangerous. But he also can strike out which does here, also possibly not a pitch in the strikezone that. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 1st Norris walks Torii Hunter, my least favorite Hunter of the many in this postseason, on five pitches and that\u2019s the Tigers first baserunner of the game. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 1st Ian Kinsler sets in against Bud Norris. He takes a full count but hits a long flyball out on 3-2 that Markakis reels in. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, bottom 1st Former major leaguer on Gabe Kapler, fighting the analytical fight on Twitter this postseason on Price\u2019s first strikeout: Bud Norris isn\u2019t exactly a well known quantity, but, well, I\u2019m suspicious of any figures in baseball named Bud. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 1st Cruz is first ball swinging and hits it far but it\u2019s just a routine flyball. The walk doesn\u2019t hurt Price and we have 1/2 innings gone. Only 17 1/2 more left, right? Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 1st Here\u2019s Adam \u201cNo, not Pac-Man\u201d Jones with Pearce on first and two out. He\u2019s a power threat but he\u2019s also a strikeout threat, which is what he does on an 0-2 pitch which is way way high. Two out and Price\u2019s first strikeout. Won\u2019t be his last. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 1st Steve Pearce at the plate with one out, and David Price walks him on four pitches. Well that\u2019s... unexpected from the strike-throwing Price. Orioles 0-0 Tigers, top 1st David Price\u2019s first pitch is fouled off by Markakis and here we go! The 0-1 pitch is taken for a ball. On 1-1, Markakis hits a ball to Romine for the first out of the game. This might be the only postseason game in Detroit this year and they can\u2019t get anyone better than Polanco? I mean he was pretty good and well liked by Tigers fans but... really? Predictions Okay guys, here\u2019s the challenge: Can you be a better sports prognosticator with baseball than Katy Perry is with college football? Who wins? What\u2019s the score? How does it happen? Email Hunter.Felt@theguardian.com or tweet @HunterFelt with your predictions. Winner gets to stage dive in bars to Journey\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believing.\u201d I say that the Orioles complete the sweep, like 5-4 after another 9th inning rally off the Detroit relievers despite David Price taking a no-hitter into the fifth. Detroit Tigers lineup 1. Ian Kinsler, 2B 2. Torii Hunter, RF 3. Miguel Cabrera, 1B 4. Victor Martinez, DH 5. J.D. Martinez, LF 6. Alex Avila, C 7. Nick Castellanos, 3B 8. Andrew Romine, SS 9.

Jonathan Schoop, 2B In the National League Division Series So, what\u2019s been going on in the NL side of the playoffs? (Takes long breath.) Well on Friday, the St Louis Cardinals defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 10-9 despite reigning Cy Young winner Clayton Kershaw pitching an absolute gem and having a 6-2 lead heading into the 7th inning. Unfortunately Kerhsaw and the Dodgers were no match Cardinals Devil Magic. St Louis knocked around the best pitcher in the game, who had a historically great regular season, for six runs and tacked on a few more when he was out of the game to make it 10-6, the Dodgers cut the deficit down to 10-9 by the ninth inning but the comeback ended with Yasiel Puig whiffing with a runner on third for the final out. On Saturday, the Washington Nationals, down 0-1 in the NLDS, had Jordan Zimmermann pitching an even better game than Kershaw, until manager Matt Williams took him out and replaced him with Drew Storen with two out in the bottom of the 9th with a 1-0 Washington lead. Storen, making his first appearance since his role in blowing Game 5 of the NLDS in 2012, had yet another nightmare inning, allowing a run to tie the game at 1-1. From there on out the Nationals and Giants played A WHOLE EXTRA GAME, 18 innings and 6pm. (Luckily Matt Williams didn\u2019t have to be there for the whole game having been long since ejected.) The game didn\u2019t finish until just after midnight on the East Coast some six and a half hours after it had begun thanks to a Brandon Belt solo home run which clinched a 2-1 Giants victory. With that the Giants secured a 2-0 series lead and are now heading home needing just one victory to make the NLCS. By the time that game had ended, the Dodgers and Cardinals were in the seventh inning, where viewers just turning in had a chance to see St Louis tie up the Dodgers once again in late innings although they were spared extra innings thanks to a Matt Kemp solo home run in the 8th that accounted for the Dodgers 3-2 victory. That series is the only one of the four Division Series to currently be tied at 1-1. (Whew.) Okay I\u2019m not going to lie to you folks, this is going to be a long preamble. A lot has happened since the last MLB playoffs liveblog, when the San Francisco Giants were beating the tar out of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League Wild Card Game. Let\u2019s start with the game at hand, though. The Baltimore Orioles come into this afternoon\u2019s American League Division Series Game 3 at Detroit\u2019s Comerica Park with a 2-0 ALDS lead. The key in their victories on Thursday and Friday has been the Orioles offense\u2019s success against their opponents\u2019 vulnerable bullpen which has been bad enough that we\u2019re one more collapse away from an online movement to replace the term \u201cdumpster fire\u201d with \u201cTigers bullpen.\u201d In Game 1, the Orioles scored 8 runs in the 8th, turning a close game into a 12-3 blowout. In Game 2, after Detroit managed to get a few innings of impeccable long relief from rehabbing starter Anibal Sanchez, Tigers manager Brad Ausmus turned the game over to Joba Chamberlain with a comfortable lead, only for Chamberlain to blow up once again and none of the firemen manager Brad Ausmus was able to use managed to douse out the flames. Baltimore eventually won 7-6. (Chamberlain was only able to get one out on Friday, but this reduced his postseason ERA from infinity to 108.00.) So although tonight\u2019s matchup, which features former Cy Young winner David Price, whom the Tigers acquired from the Tampa Bay Rays specifically for these do-or-die postseason elimination games, facing the somewhat less heralded Bud Norris, who didn\u2019t even know he was going to start this game until right around the time we did. This possible mismatch just might not matter if the game\u2019s not in the starter\u2019s hands. The middle innings relieving core is less of an Achilles heel for the Tigers than an Achilles leg or Achilles lower torso and Joe Nathan, their ninth inning guy, isn\u2019t exactly nails anymore like he was when he was the Best Closer Not Named Rivera. He\u2019s not even tacks anymore, he\u2019s scotch tape. So, Ausmus\u2019s best hope is for David Price to go at least eight innings today. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that Detroit is playing their first game at home at Comerica. Plus no team can be fully out of it when they have an even-slower-but-always-threatening Miguel Cabrera and the very dangerous Victor Martinez, who has basically refused to strike out all season long. The Baltimore Orioles just don\u2019t seem as scary as the Tigers, but they haven\u2019t really looked like world-beaters all year along and all it\u2019s gotten them is a win away from the American League Championship Series. During the regular season and now are just one game away from making the American League Championship Series with a pieced together lineup missing some of their best players, including the injured infielder Manny Machado, recuperation catcher Matt Wieters and the suspended slugger Chris Davis. Much like the Kansas City Royals, similarly up 2-0 on their opponents, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts for this Baltimore team. Unlike the Kansas City Royals, stuck with the bumbling but successful Ned Yost, the MLB\u2019s very own Maxwell Smart, they have Buck Showalter, a manager who seems to know what he\u2019s doing. Meanwhile in the National League? Oh man, you know what, I\u2019ll deal with that in a separate post, I\u2019m already going long. Let\u2019s just say that last night the Washington Nationals and San Francisco Giants played in the longest MLB game in postseason history and it may not have been the craziest of the four games we\u2019ve had so far in the NLDS. And the other ALDS between Kansas City Royals vs the LA Angels of Anaheim? Well I\u2019ll let the esteemed David Lengel explain how that series is going around 7:00pm EST when he liveblogs Game 3 here at the Guardian for the second-half of this postseason double header. He\u2019ll most likely have time as the first three Royals postseason games have all gone into extra innings. Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves, right now-ish, the O\u2019s have a chance to become the first team to move on to the next round of the MLB playoffs. Remember we\u2019ll be using your comments, questions and jokes about this game or these insane playoffs in general throughout this afternoon\u2019s liveblog. You can email them to Hunter.Felt@theguardian.com or tweet them to @HunterFelt and we\u2019ll post them here. It\u2019s the Baltimore Orioles vs the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. The first pitch is scheduled at 3:45 pm EST/8:45 BST but we\u2019ll be back much earlier than that with predictions, lineups and a futile attempt at catching you up with what just happened in the National League."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
