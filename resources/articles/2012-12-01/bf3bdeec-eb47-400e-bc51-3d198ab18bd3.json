This was to be his big year, its centrepiece a retrospective at Tate Modern to coincide with the Olympics. The art critics seemed disposed to be kind, as he kicked off his victory year with a worldwide exhibition at Larry Gagosian's global chain of galleries that brimmed with all the spot paintings he has ever got people to paint for him. Then came the Tate show, drawing record crowds to wonder at his early works. They admired a rotting cow's head, its blood oozing out on the wooden gallery floor, while in a nearby vitrine a pickled tiger shark grinned melancholically. And then he blew it. While at the Tate parents were showing their children butterflies trapped in paint, Hirst opened an exhibition of his very newest creations at the White Cube gallery in Bermondsey, London. Hirst, it turns out, is trying to become a master of still-life painting. He has been hard at work, alone and unaided, on canvases of fruit and foetuses, flowers and skulls. Normal critical words of dismissal such as \"leaden\", \"pretentious\", \"crass\", \"empty\", do not do justice to Hirst's still-life paintings. All are applicable but none really captures the magnitude of failure we are talking about. Hirst has absolutely zero ability as a representational painter. For him to exhibit his would-be realistic paintings for people to see, buy and review was the equivalent of me inviting people to come and hear me give a piano recital of Bach's Goldberg Variations. I cannot play the piano. Hirst is not a painter at all in any meaningful artistic way (no, not even ironically). His daubs are full of basic clumsy errors that would get black marks in any classroom. Amateur weekend artists would be ashamed of his hackery. Just to confirm that he has truly lost any verve or wit he ever had, Hirst followed up this extravagant display of inability by raising an ugly and pompous colossal statue in Ifracombe, giving the tourists a great reason to avoid this Devon seaside community. But does his self-exposure have wider significance? Hirst is in many ways the linchpin of the way art is currently defined, enjoyed, bought and sold around the world. Twenty-five years ago he took the idea of the readymade pioneered by Marcel Duchamp and the theories of 1960s conceptual art and boldly popularised them. His animal vitrines asserted with real conviction that you can make art with anything and be a genius because of ideas, not skill. Now he has confessed, with his ambitious yet miserably unaccomplished still-life paintings, that he admires the skilled art of the past, and would love to paint like Manet or Vel\u00e1zquez, after all. In admitting this \u2013 and revealing his total failure by such standards \u2013 he makes it seem as if the whole edifice of conceptually lubricated contemporary art is as brittle and fake as he has turned out to be.
