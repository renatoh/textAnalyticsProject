Spurs travel to Anfield tomorrow in a match which has been reported to be Jol's final chance to save his job against a team who he is yet to beat as a manager. Yet while both clubs have spent heavily on strengthening their squads in the summer, Jol cites his board's policy of investing in young players as mitigation for recent failures. \"You still can't compare us. They made investments and we bought [Gareth] Bale, [Younes] Kaboul and Kevin-Prince Boateng, but that is different. That is for now and for the future.\" Jol's emphasis was on the present, and when his team take the field against Rafael Ben\u00edtez's former European Cup winners, it is easy to see why. While the Spaniard has the stoicism and experience of Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher to call upon, Jol's skipper Ledley King is still to play this season, and his senior professionals Paul Robinson and Robbie Keane are far from natural leaders. \"It's about leadership. If Ledley King is not there you have to educate someone like Kaboul or [Michael] Dawson,\" said Jol. \"Tommy Huddlestone is pulling the strings but he is 20 years old. It's totally different if you compare us, but I feel we have the future. If you see Bale, he's going forward and scoring and he's only 18, but he can also be vulnerable and that is something we have to work on.\" Nurturing a talent as prodigious as Bale's is a source of great pride for Jol, but it also brings frustration in equal measure. The Dutchman has frequently lamented his side's lack of wisdom, but his board's steadfast refusal to buy players whose value may depreciate has been a source of tension. \"I would be happy if we had a settled team and pushed one or two younger players through. That would be an ideal situation but we are not in that situation so I have to play them,\" said Jol, whose senior midfielder, the 24-year-old Jermaine Jenas, is available after a groin injury. Despite his difficult position, Jol is not yet talking like a defeated man, and the opportunity to prove his doubters wrong will once again provide motivation. So too will Liverpool's own recent travails, culminating in Wednesday's 1-0 defeat by Marseille. \"You can look at it in two different ways. If they had a comfortable win you could say it would be easier, but now they have to put things right.\" Jol may bridle at comparisons between his plight and that of Ben\u00edtez, but for now, both managers have work to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
