Most of the unopened post had been destined for local addresses. Depot boss John Adams said: \"It seems he started with junk mail, thinking it couldn't incriminate him, but as time ran out he began dumping people's post.\" The 55-year-old, who left his job a year ago, worked in a sorting office and covered for deliveries. He could face charges. The Royal Mail said it would deliver as much of the post as possible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
