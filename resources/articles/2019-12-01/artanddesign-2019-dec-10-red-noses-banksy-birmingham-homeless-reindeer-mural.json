The vandal added red noses to the reindeer on Monday night. The mural, as depicted on Banksy\u2019s Instagram account, shows two reindeer pulling a homeless man on a bench. It was painted by the enigmatic street artist over the weekend. Banksy\u2019s video shows the homeless person, Ryan, having a drink before lying down on the bench as the camera pans out. The artist added the comment: \u201cGod bless Birmingham. In the 20 minutes we filmed Ryan on this bench passers-by gave him a hot drink, two chocolate bars and a lighter \u2013 without him ever asking for anything.\u201d A commuter who happened to pass by on her way to work on Friday morning claims she saw a man setting up close to the wall. She said: \u201cIt was around 7 o\u2019clock on Friday morning when I got off the bus and saw a man giving a few snacks to a homeless man who was sitting on the bench. I wouldn\u2019t have thought it was Banksy, I just thought it was someone helping out the homeless.\u201d Martin Clarke, a jeweller at Vault 88, claims to have seen two workmen early on Friday morning working on the wall which is directly outside his shop. \u201cI saw a small tent with a couple of lads in high-vis vests early in the morning on Friday. I thought they were from the council and were just doing a bit of upkeep. About half six I looked out the window and the tent had gone as had the lads. Then I saw it. \u201cI thought it was great. We weren\u2019t sure what it was at first or who did it but we had a good idea.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
