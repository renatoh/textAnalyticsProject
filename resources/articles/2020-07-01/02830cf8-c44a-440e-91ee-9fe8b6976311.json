The complete review of La Liga's 2019-20 season", "bodyText": "In the 101st minute of the 35th week, still playing way after midnight and well into summer in Europe\u2019s hottest city, the two best things that can happen in football happened at the same time: a forward who had gone in goal saved a shot from a goalkeeper who had gone up front, stopping the man he had beaten from beating him back. It was that kind of season. \u201cI never imagined this,\u201d said Sevilla\u2019s Lucas Ocampos, trying not to giggle after he had pulled on the gloves and denied Eibar\u2019s Marko Dimitrovic. No one really imagined any of it. Never mind imagining it: by then, it was hard enough to remember: where it had all begun, who had been there. Fran Escrib\u00e1, anyone? David Gallego? Looking back on 2019-2020, one feeling recurs most: wait, what, that was this season? Some time in September, Barcelona striker Luis Su\u00e1rez said \u201cwe\u2019ve got a long, hard season ahead of us\u201d, but even he couldn\u2019t have imagined how long, and how hard \u2013 and not only for Bar\u00e7a, although boy had they packed a lot in. Just not the title, not this time. By the time the league finished, it was a full year since Real Madrid had let in seven against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in New York and everyone lost their heads. \u201cKeep calm,\u201d Zinedine Zidane had said amid the gathering storm, \u201cwe\u2019re going to see good things.\u201d As usual, he was right somehow: 12 months on, they had won the title. Just as importantly, though not all of them were good, we saw a lot of things, alright. Just not much from the season\u2019s three most expensive signings, Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, Antoine Griezmann and Eden Hazard. And even less from Luka Jovic, the fourth. Things like endless bloody VAR delays, more penalties than ever before, loads of coaches \u2013 11 sacked during the campaign, four more gone at its finish \u2013 the youngest kid to get a goal in La Liga and the oldest man to get three of them. In just 19 minutes, too. All that stretched over an 11-month season. In the autumn, the cl\u00e1sico got postponed until December, and later so did Eibar-Real Sociedad. In mid-March, as coronavirus took hold, it all was, 2019-20 eventually becoming two distinct seasons stuck together and not always holding well. When football returned after lockdown nothing was the same, like it belonged to a different season, a different time, a different world. Eleven matches squeezed into five weeks, nobody squeezed into stadiums, bird song accompanying the ball. La Liga had become a place where 170,000 watched Legan\u00e9s-Madrid on the PlayStation and closer to 170 watched the actual game in the stadium, bag of sweets replaced by a bag of wipes, handwash, gloves and a face mask. Television coloured in the stands and applied a canned soundtrack where a premature, trigger-happy technician had Real Sociedad\u2019s \u201cfans\u201d shouting \u201cgooool\u201d at a shot that went wide. Miles better than the \u201ctech\u201d were the cardboard cut-outs and even former players \u201ccheering\u201d Villarreal. And the only place an actual fan could watch an actual game was from the 14th floor of the building next door. The men in the VAR room meanwhile gave the distinct impression they weren\u2019t watching at all. This was the kind of season in which a game was finally stopped \u2013 not because of racist or homophobic chants, but anti-fascist ones. And in which the Spanish Super Cup \u201cof equality\u201d was played in Saudi Arabia, won by neither the champions nor the cup winners, with fans helpfully reminded not to take pork products \u2013 even if they are vacuum packed. A season so strange even Javier Tebas and Luis Rubiales briefly stopped fighting, heads banged together by the minister of sport. In a secret eight-hour meeting at the Viana palace, summoned there in silence, their mobiles confiscated, they had agreed to ensure that this was the kind of season that was completed, at least. They thought they had succeeded, too: as the first division was played out, there was relief and pride too: the protocols had worked. They\u2019d made it. They very next night, the final round in the second division couldn\u2019t be completed because of an outbreak of coronavirus in the Fuenlabrada team, leaving everyone in limbo, collapsing into chaos and accusation. One player was taken to hospital, the rest were stuck in their hotel and there were 28 positives \u2013 a timely reminder of how serious this all is. The second division is not the only unfinished competition. There is still Europe to come and the best Copa del Rey in memory provided the perfect climax only for a first final between Real Sociedad and Athletic to be postponed, the clubs agreeing to wait as long as it takes for their fans to be able to join them. The first division, though, is done \u2013 and that didn\u2019t always seem certain. Nor did the outcome, and who knows how it would have ended had the season not been so strange. On the day general elections were held \u2013 although that doesn\u2019t narrow it down much \u2013 AS announced the end of the \u201cend of the two-party system\u201d with six teams within two points at the top. Spain had reached week 10 with six different leaders: Madrid, Sevilla, Athletic, Atl\u00e9tico, Barcelona and Granada. By the end, though, Madrid and Bar\u00e7a were way above the rest. Winners of eight of the last 11 leagues, Barcelona \u201cwon\u201d 2019-2020 part one, but not part two, a seven-point post-lockdown swing costing them a title too many took for granted. They had been top, if not that good, when they sacked Ernesto Valverde. The coach\u2019s capacity to contain a crisis had gone from a club with problems and maybe he was better off out of it. Quique Seti\u00e9n, lifted in from among the cows in Liencres, admitted he had never handled anything like this and couldn\u2019t save them from themselves. Real Madrid hadn\u2019t exactly started well and, while it\u2019s forgotten now, Zidane might have gone the same way. Beaten 3-0 in Paris, defeated in Palma, Madrid travelled to Istanbul with the coach on the edge. \u201cIf you love him, win,\u201d Marca demanded, which they did. Stabilised but still under pressure, a first cl\u00e1sico victory at the Bernab\u00e9u set them up nicely, only for them to immediately lose to Real Betis and go into lockdown behind Barcelona. The restart suited Madrid: when the league turned into something like a Champions League \u2013 the Coronavirus League, Sergio Ramos called it \u2013 they won it. Ten consecutive wins took them there, culminating in victory over Villarreal at the training ground that had become their home. On the final day, job done and Gareth Bale on holiday, they drew 2-2 in Legan\u00e9s \u2013 the city hit hardest by Covid-19 and the ground where 18 shirts sat in silent homage. Struggling from the start, Javier Aguirre\u2019s arrival had brought Legan\u00e9s hope but winter brought departures, an already limited team losing Yousef En-Nesyri and Martin Braithwaite. A measure of the impact: when they went to the Pizju\u00e1n and the Camp Nou, Sevilla and Barcelona\u2019s teams had more Legan\u00e9s goals in their teams than Legan\u00e9s did. They fought to the finish but with the last kick, Oscar\u2019s shot sailed into the empty stands, taking hope with it. If you thought the emergency signing rule didn\u2019t make sense when Braithwaite left, in mid-June Celta were allowed to sign striker Nolito because of an injury to \u2026 a goalkeeper. His goal against Betis proved the difference between going down and staying up. Well, that and \u00d3scar\u2019s shot, which Celta\u2019s terrified subs watched on their phones. Despite having Iago Aspas, a midfielder who was Okay and a team miles too good to go down, Celta were perilously close to doing just that. Legan\u00e9s went down with Mallorca, who knew relegation was likely right from the start but had resisted almost to the last. Also down were Espanyol, the club where Abelardo explained his presence by saying \u201cmaybe I\u2019m a masochist\u201d and the sporting director got though three managers before putting himself in charge. Which only really changed his view of a pitiful team sliding sadly into Segunda 26 years later. At the other end, Atl\u00e9tico and Sevilla joined Madrid in the Champions League. Real Sociedad, the most enjoyable team until lockdown and, weirdly, one of the worst after, missed the grand prize but at least clinched a Europa League slot along with Villarreal and Granada. \u201cWe\u2019re still not conscious of what we\u2019ve done,\u201d Granada manager Diego Mart\u00ednez said. A newly-promoted team with the division\u2019s third smallest budget, they reached Europe for the first time. That meant Valencia and Getafe missed out \u2013 which was no more than Valencia deserved, having undone all their good work, opened up a divide with their fans and gone through with their claim that a manager should be a mere \u201cfunctionary\u201d, sacking two of them before sticking the delegate in charge again. It was, in contrast, perhaps less than Getafe deserved. On the final day, they were defeated by a 99th-minute goal having missed a penalty and had three goals ruled out, leaving them with nothing. Well, not nothing exactly. There are always the awards they really, really want. And how about starting with something serious before it gets silly? Most unexpected hero Getafe president \u00c1ngel Torres, who refused to take his team to Milan, even though there was history to be made, and forcing Uefa\u2019s hand. It may be no exaggeration to say he saved a lot of lives. Kindest player Pablo De Blassis extended his Eibar contract for three weeks to finish the season \u2013 and gave the money to the club\u2019s cleaners and kitchen staff. Then there\u2019s the club captain who saw a small boy waiting in the cold outside the ground and took him onto the team bus. Ten minutes later the boy was back and beaming, carrying an autograph book full of signatures. Kindest club Real Sociedad, who invited an entire town to watch them play. Most principled club Third-tier Unionistas de Salamanca, turning down more money than they had ever seen and insisting on playing Real Madrid at their tiny home rather than at the Bernab\u00e9u. Almost beating them, too. Silliest card Leandro Cabrera, booked for calling referee Carlos del Cerro Grande a cockroach when he had actually said an opponent had ducked. Well, se agacha does sound a tiny bit like cucaracha. But that\u2019s nothing compared to Fuenlabrada\u2019s Cristobal: mistakenly sent off, sent back on again, and immediately sent off once more. Best signing C\u00e9dric Bakambu got stuck in Hong Kong, his move to the Camp Nou called off halfway there, so it can\u2019t be him. It could be one of many at Sevilla, Ocampos especially. But, come on, it\u2019s got to be Chimy \u00c1vila \u2013 at \u20ac1.35m a thigh. Best moment Nabil Fekir\u2019s 90th-minute knee slide, Bruno\u2019s return, Vinicius\u2019s tears? This contest is over. Referee Xavier Estrada Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s Hans Moleman moment works on so many levels. Others have heart but this has a football in the groin. Best game El Mundo\u2019s headline said \u201cthis Christmas, give the gift of Osasuna-Real Sociedad\u201d, which neatly summed up a wonderful 3-4 in which Martin \u00d8degaard and \u00c1vila slugged it out and Always Watch Real were words to live by, at least until lockdown. Their trip to Madrid, the visit of Barcelona, that night in Seville. Madrid-Valencia was good and Valencia-Madrid was decided in the 94th minute when the 35th shot ended in the net, thanks to Thibaut Courtois going up for a corner. Yet here\u2019s hoping that the best is the one match that hasn\u2019t been played: Athletic v Real in the Copa del Rey final. One day. Worst game Jos\u00e9 Luis Mend\u00edlibar was asked what he thought of Eibar 0-0 Legan\u00e9s. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cit was behind closed doors, meaning nobody had to pay and I\u2019m glad about that.\u201d Best movement off the ball An example of losing your marker from Celta striker Fyodor Smolov, slinking out of Spain and into Russia during lockdown to celebrate the 18th birthday of his girlfriend, Boris Yeltsin\u2019s granddaughter Maria. Still, at least he flew: teammate Pione Sisto had driven all the way to Denmark. Fastest player Nyom. Best pet Marcos Llorente\u2019s new dog. Anfield, it\u2019s called. Best tackle Who thinks it\u2019s this? Aidoo. Best goal The season\u2019s very best goal might have been its very first, a last-minute overhead kick and a glorious way for Aritz Aduriz to go. Habitual winner Leo Messi had his worst season for years, still scored 25 goals, provided 22 assists, and flew into the Death Star trench to destroy Atl\u00e9tico, leaving Diego Simeone shrugging \u201call you can do is applaud\u201d. Not least when it comes to his free kicks, the best of which might have been the one he didn\u2019t score but, wise to plans to deny him, dropped on to Su\u00e1rez\u2019s head instead. Iago Aspas scored a clever one the same day. The best free-kick taker was actually Legan\u00e9s forward \u00d3scar, one last-minute winner prompting coach Aguirre to admit: \u201cI hugged him [but] I\u2019m not sure what I said. Almost certainly: \u2018Very good, you son of a bitch! You\u2019re the fucking business, I shit on your fucking mother, I shit on the mother that gave birth to you, how brilliant!\u2019 Something like that.\u201d And if that was tasty, this was just silly. Even the pink beach ball couldn\u2019t ruin Ocampos\u2019s touch against Getafe. Jorge Molina sent two men out for milk against Valencia. And I\u00f1aki Williams left Valladolid on the floor. Meanwhile, what made Jos\u00e9 Luis Morales\u2019s goal so good was the fact that he only did it because he couldn\u2019t be bothered to do anything else. Gon\u00e7alo Guedes got knocked down and got up again, Doctor Diego Cervero scored from the halfway line and if Sergi Guardiola meant this, wow. For the assists: Denis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s impossible pass for Santi Mina. \u201cPhenomenal,\u201d Zidane called it. As was Karim Benzema\u2019s goal finished by Casemiro. But joining Aduriz on the podium are Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s bouncing backheel, Benzema\u2019s ridiculous volley, and Dami\u00e1n Su\u00e1rez morphing into Maradona. \u00c1vila scored two the same man shouldn\u2019t be able to score in the same game \u2013 the first a delicate dink, the second a human wrecking ball, bashing everyone out the way before heading in his own cross. But even more unique, absurd and beautiful than that was a goal you haven\u2019t just not seen before, you won\u2019t see again. Put up by Santi Cazorla, put away by Gerard Moreno. The touch, my God. And the finish, bloody hell. Best celebration Some people can start a fight in an empty house; Iago Aspas can start a fiesta in an empty stadium. Best fans Fuenlabrada\u2019s subs. Best manager Zidane went away, came back, risked that legacy and somehow managed to be better than before, even magicking a cl\u00e1sico goal out of Mariano, for goodness\u2019 sake. Aguirre nearly performed another miracle. Arrasate is Osasuna\u2019s Klopp, they say at El Sadar. And Getafe\u2019s fans still love last year\u2019s winner Jos\u00e9 Bordal\u00e1s, even if they can\u2019t serenade him any more. Better known as Agerre II, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Lopetegui is a champion harrijsotzaile or Basque stone-lifter whose son Julen is a pretty good coach. And surviving with Valladolid is Sergio\u2019s success again. But there is one, clear winner. Diego Mart\u00ednez is the youngest manager in Spain; next year, he\u2019ll be the youngest in Europe. Best player Strip it down to basics and Messi is still the best around, a victim of his own standards. His worst season in a decade was better than just about everyone else\u2019s best ever. Probably the most consistent player overall was Casemiro. Until lockdown, \u00d8degaard made a strong case. And after it, Ramos did. Then there\u2019s Cazorla. But the player of the year is the man whose two goals clinched the title on the penultimate night and whose goals on 16 other nights did so too. Benzema\u2019s goals earned more points than anyone else\u2019s and he also gave eight assists but he shouldn\u2019t be measured solely in stats. Asked about that backheel, he shrugged, looked a bit embarrassed and replied: \u201cSometimes things come from within me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s Karim,\u201d Zidane said. And finally: God bless, Michael."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
