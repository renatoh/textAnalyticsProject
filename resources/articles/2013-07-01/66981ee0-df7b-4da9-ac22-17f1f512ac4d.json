With consumer price limits up to 2020 due to be thrashed out later this year, Byatt, Britain's top water regulator throughout the 1990s, has called for new rules requiring any windfall profits to be shared between shareholders and consumers. Launching a paper from thinktank CentreForum, he proposed that utilities should be forced to reduce water bills if they seek to pay bumper dividends in excess of returns envisaged by the regulator at the time of their five-yearly pricing review. \"I would like to see a return to the kind of sliding scale control of dividends used to regulate the British gas industry in the 19th century,\" he said \u2013 a reference to a regime imposed on the commercially volatile early gas supply industry. Byatt has been one of the leading critics of the water industry in recent years, with much of his attacks focused on private-equity-owned firms, labouring under heavy borrowings taken on to boost shareholder returns. \"In the case of Thames Water, this has damaged its credit rating, leading to requests to government for guarantees to enable the company to carry out the Thames Tideway sewerage project,\" he said. This 16-mile addition to London's sewerage network is estimated to cost \u00a34.2bn and has been described as the biggest improvement to the system since Sir Joseph Bazalgette's pioneering efforts in the 1850s. Since Ofwat's last five-yearly price review in 2009, the regulator has acknowledged that several highly indebted water companies have enjoyed previously unforeseen profits from a period of very low debt financing costs and stubbornly above-target inflation. A spokesman for Ofwat said: \"We are changing a culture to get companies to take more responsibility for their plans and listen to their customers \u2013 not simply tick regulatory boxes. \"We have also challenged the sector to become more transparent to make sure companies maintain their legitimacy with their customers. \"We welcome all contributions to the debate. Our absolute priority will be making sure customers get a fair deal.\" The CentreForum report, to which Byatt contributed forwarding remarks, sets out a series of options to give regulations more teeth. Condemning \"an opaque, overleveraged and poorly regulated industry that consistently places short-term profit above the interests of consumers and taxpayers,\" the report raises the prospect of a levy on utility firms heaped high with debt. The report's author George Turner also calls on ministers to learn lessons from Germany, where regulators have imposed rules limiting the extent to which utilities can exploit tax rules by taking on high borrowings that lower their bill. \"For years now customers have been paying too much for their water and shareholders have been running off with giant profits. \"This is unacceptable in an industry which is so fundamental to people's lives and where customers cannot choose their supplier.\" \"What is worse, excessive profits have come about through a weakening of the financial strength of companies built up over many years of public investment. \"It is now time for parliament and the regulator to demand better standards from the water industry.\" Research from the Consumer Council for Water, a government-sponsored body established to represent household customers, has estimated that water company profits were inflated by \u00a3720m over the last two years due to low interest rates and higher-than-expected inflation. One industry insider, who declined to be named, insisted the regulatory model was working well. \"Ofwat sets price limits at a level which should allow a well-managed, efficient company to deliver its statutory commitments, meet its targets and finance itself effectively. \"That includes paying dividends to shareholders at a level that provides an appropriate return on investment, subject of course to delivering on commitments and meeting targets. \"This policy has enabled more than \u00a3100bn to be invested in the UK water industry since privatisation in 1989.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
