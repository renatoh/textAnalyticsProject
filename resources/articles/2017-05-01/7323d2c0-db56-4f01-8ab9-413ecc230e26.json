The 23-year-old, who has been followed by some of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs this season, admitted on Sunday night that Benfica\u2019s cup final victory over Vitoria was \u201cprobably my last game\u201d for the club. The Brazilian, who is renowned for his footballing skills, possesses one of the longest kicks in the game \u2013 he once scored from his own box in his youth career \u2013 fits Pep Guardiola\u2019s mould for a keeper and is expected in Manchester for a medical this week. \u201cI still don\u2019t know but this was probably my last game for Benfica,\u201d he said, after the 2-1 defeat of Vitoria. Ederson\u2019s fee would represent a world record for a goalkeeper, eclipsing the \u00a332.6m paid by Juventus to Parma for Gianluigi Buffon in 2001. City may have to overcome some complications with third-party ownership as his former club Rio Ave still own 50 per cent of the goalkeeper\u2019s economic rights. Benfica possess the other half. It also means Benfica are holding out for a large transfer fee. Several outstanding displays in the Champions League this season have bolstered Ederson\u2019s reputation. He has been called up to the Brazil squad but has not yet made his international debut. He won a Portuguese league and cup double this season and the club are expecting his departure, with the coach Rui Vit\u00f3ria saying: \u201cIf Ederson leaves, he leaves with the gratitude of Benfica.\u201d City have struggled for consistency between the posts with Claudio Bravo, signed from Barcelona last summer, enduring a difficult season while Willy Caballero has left after his contract came to an end. Ederson\u2019s arrival would cast further doubt on the prospects of England\u2019s No1 Joe Hart, who has spent the season on loan at Torino and is expected to be sold in the summer. The signing would also represent a blow for City\u2019s Manchester rivals United, should David de Gea make his move to Real Madrid, with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho an admirer of the goalkeeper. Mourinho has been linked with Ederson and if, as expected, De Gea departs for Spain in the coming months, he will need a new No1 at Old Trafford, although he may decide he can begin the campaign with Sergio Romero. United have also been linked with the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak, should De Gea make his move to the Spanish capital. City have begun the post-season period ambitiously and last week completed the \u00a343m signing of Monaco\u2019s Bernardo Silva. Jes\u00fas Navas, Ga\u00ebl Clichy and Bacary Sagna departed last week in addition to Caballero and Pablo Zabaleta, while Newcastle United have been linked with their out-of-favour centre-half Eliaquim Mangala. Rafael Ben\u00edtez is reportedly keen on the defender but he will have to battle with his former club Valencia for his services. The newly promoted club are ready to pay a \u00a315m asking price for the 26-year-old who cost the club \u00a332m when he moved from Porto in 2014."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
