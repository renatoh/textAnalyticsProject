A close friend of Gary Speed and of a similar age, he is expected to carry on the good work of his predecessor and not change too much along the way. That seemed to be the remit from the players, anyway. Gareth Bale and Sam Ricketts have both said that the backroom staff should be kept in place, most notably the coach Raymond Verheijen. Coleman, however, may have other ideas. \"I've got a strong relationship with Kit Symons,\" he said. \"He's doing a great job at Fulham with the under-18s. Every job I've taken I like to bring in some new faces. I don't know Raymond [although] I've been in his company, I respect Raymond and if I do have a problem I'll have that conversation with him.\" Since the sad passing of Speed almost every member of the Welsh squad has had his say on who should take over \u2013 Aaron Ramsey even said that he was disappointed that the players had not been consulted over the next appointment, which is to be applauded if only for the sheer nerve of a 21-year-old with 20 caps. It could also be seized upon as evidence that the captain's armband is best suited to a senior player. That said, during the hiring process for a new manager at one of my clubs, the hierarchy asked me into a room to discuss potential candidates. This is highly unusual and, as I told them at the time, very uncomfortable for a player. Imagine sitting in a room with a board of executives and being asked to \"give a view\" on potential new managers; it can only end in disaster because I felt that anything that I said was, at one stage or another, likely to get back to the new manager as well as the other candidates. So even the managers I knew I wouldn't enjoy working with ended up receiving a glowing review. The reality is that the last thing a new manager needs is for his players to be calling the shots because that is the slippery slope to ruin. By the same token, he certainly doesn't want to isolate the squad before having a chance to get his feet under the table. One thing is for sure, based on what has been said by the players in interviews since Speed's death, Coleman will already know who to be wary of within the squad. The first week of a new manager's reign is often fairly low key. There are handshakes and pleasantries while he takes in training from afar, making mental notes about each player's game and behaviour. One or two players will go out of their way to kiss his arse but even as I get older and more aware that this man hands out the contracts, I refuse to break my moral tradition. I do, however, take the time to have a chat about football with him while dropping in little-known names and results from abroad in a fairly weak attempt to showcase my broad knowledge of the game because I have more than one eye on a part time scouting-cum-coach role when my playing days are over. At the moment it is difficult to gauge whether or not he is genuinely impressed by my obscure football trivia or desperately thinking of an excuse to extract himself from the conversation; the sign of a good manager is that he never gives anything away. The biggest mistake a new manager can make is to get too close to the players as a way of getting them onside. I had one who would literally crack jokes with us as we were walking out to play a match only to bollock us for being a goal down at half-time. It smacked of double standards and because of that he never had the respect that a manager needs from players earning big wages and harbouring even bigger egos. There are better ways to endear yourself to a squad of players. A new manager needs to stamp his authority on the squad from day one and to achieve this very often he will sacrifice a player for the bigger picture, as was the case at our club. It doesn't matter if that player is capable and well liked (actually, those players are the preferred target). The process generally leads to the player being singled out for ridicule in training and made an example of at every opportunity, before being sent to train with the kids and ostracised from the first team. It is meant as a clear example to everyone that the manager is in charge. I don't like this method; it is completely unnecessary and has all the hallmarks of someone with no man-management skills to speak of. A friend of mine is going through the same treatment right now and, believe me, he isn't a lot of fun to speak to on the phone. The rise of managers such as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Andr\u00e9 Villas\u2011Boas and Brendan Rodgers in the modern game has also won over the players who once believed that the only manager worth signing for was the one that had a few medals safely tucked away from his playing days. In truth, lots of them have no input during training and there are more than a few that leave everything to their coaches, especially if they are well liked and respected by the players. In fact I am told that one ex-Manchester United player turned manager has a reputation for showing his face only on Saturday for the game. International management is different again. In the case of Wales, Coleman will not be able to cast an eye over his squad at close quarters until the end of February, plenty of time for his players to throw a few more spanners in the works. That said Wales, under Speed, were clearly showing signs that they were on to something with their dynamic young squad and attractive style of football. The last thing Chris Coleman needs is for the egos to sabotage that progress.
