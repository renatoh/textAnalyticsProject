The 27-year-old left-hander, the team\u2019s presumptive No 1 starter who had been expected to start on opening day before he was sidelined, has been diagnosed with myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart that has been found at a high rate in recovered coronavirus patients. Rodr\u00edguez tested positive for the virus before flying to Boston for an abbreviated training camp in early July, describing symptoms including headaches, nausea and a high fever. After recovering and joining the club, he was diagnosed with the temporary ailment. \u201cWe are confident that he\u2019s going to make a full recovery and that his longterm prognosis is excellent, but the fact of the matter is there\u2019s just just not enough time left this season to safely ramp him back up to pitching,\u201d Red Sox chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom said. Rodriguez had said last Sunday that his doctors told him that 10-20% of people who have had Covid-19 also have been diagnosed with myocarditis. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important part of your body, so when you hear that, the first time I hear it was kind of scared a little,\u2019\u2019 Rodriguez said. \u201cNow that I know what it is, it\u2019s still scary, but I know exactly what it is. Just talk to my mom, talk to my wife, they know what I have and everything. Now we just gotta take the rest. That\u2019s hard, but you gotta take a rest.\u201d The Venezuela native is coming off his best major league campaign. Rodriguez posted a 19-6 record with a 3.81 ERA in 2019 and set career highs in wins, ERA, innings (203 1/3), starts (34) and strikeouts (213). The announcement from the Red Sox came hours after the coronavirus forced baseball\u2019s 18th postponement in 10 days on Saturday, prompting at least two more players to opt out of the season entirely and casting doubt the league can complete the truncated season it started less than two weeks ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
