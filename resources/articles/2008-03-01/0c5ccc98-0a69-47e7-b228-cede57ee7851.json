While a Florida mulligan has been dead for a while, there was still hope that Michigan might work something out. But everything seems to have evaporated Wednesday morning: quarrelling state senators couldn't agree on a plan that they would have to pass, and they seem to have concluded that there's no chance that they will agree. There are two broad sticking points. The first is money, as in who would pay for re-running the primary. The cost of holding an election has been estimated at up to $12m, and no one involved - the state of Michigan, the national Democratic Party, or the two presidential campaigns - wants to spend the money. The second is that there are a handful of important procedural snags. Both the Obama campaign and the Clinton campaign have written memos arguing their respective cases on these points, and you can read both of them here. To take one salient example, there's a seemingly intractable dispute over what they're calling \"voter disqualification\". Under Michigan state law, voters can vote in only one primary and one general election per year. Michigan has open primaries, meaning anyone can vote in them, so some number of voters who might like to vote in the re-run can't because they already voted in the earlier (legitimate) Michigan primary. The Clinton team argues that these are the rules, and it isn't fair to give one voter two primary votes while another voter got just one. The Obama camp argues that presumably, many of these voters would never have participated in the GOP primary if they'd known they might be able to vote in a later Democratic primary. They're both good arguments, so it's a tough call. But make no mistake, Obama has been the obstructionist here, and it's to his discredit that his supporters in the state have stood in the way of a re-vote. Their position is understandable, I suppose: they don't want to risk a loss for their man late in the season in a vital state, where a Clinton victory could give her momentum to present to the superdelegates. Understandable, but not really defensible. They sound afraid of a little competition. There's no reason to think that Obama couldn't do well in Michigan. It's a state that is demographically somewhere between Illinois and Ohio, and should be very competitive between the two. One fairly recent poll had a re-run coming out a 41-41 tie. Why shouldn't the Obama camp size that up and say okay, we'll take our chances? After all, if he won the re-run, Clinton would be completely finished. It would have been his one chance to proclaim himself the definitive winner, no questions asked. And even if he'd lost narrowly, he'd have gathered up enough delegates from Michigan to maintain a steady lead over Clinton. But now, with no Michigan re-vote, there will be questions. The Clinton line that Obama hasn't won any important swing states is vastly overstated - Virginia, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Missouri do count - while its own list of winnable November states is a little odd (Texas?). Assuming the voting in Pennsylvania on April 22 follows the current polls (Clinton leads by 10 or 12 percentage points), it's undeniably true that the nature of the results in Ohio and the likely results in Pennsylvania suggest that Obama might have a harder time in those two states against John McCain than Clinton would. On CNN this afternoon, Donna Brazile, consummate party insider, said that a deal might be in the works with regard to seating the delegates of Michigan and Florida. Without disclosing parameters, she said it would be a negotiated deal that would likely make neither campaign happy. We can be confident that this will be true of the Clinton camp. It wants nothing short of two re-votes. Without them, Clinton is probably finished. A deal would be a huge relief for the Democratic party, which really, desperately needs to avoid heading to its Denver convention in late August (repeat, late August: just 10 weeks before election day) with the Florida and Michigan problems still up in the air. And, depending on the terms, it would be a fine thing for Obama. It seems to me that almost any negotiated deal makes him the nominee unless something really strange happens between now and early June. That, I guess, is as it should be. He's won more states and more votes and, most of all, more delegates. But he should encouraged a Michigan re-vote. If he is the nominee, he'd better get to know the way to Detroit and Lansing and Ann Arbor and everywhere else in Michigan, because he'll be needing to spend a lot of time there.
