A Vauxhall Tigra in which the four were travelling was found almost flattened and broken into three pieces in Neston after veering off the road and crashing into a tree. The victims, two men aged 19 and 20 and two women aged 19 and 43, all from the Neston area, were pronounced dead at the scene. The car was heading north towards the Wirral in Merseyside along the A540 Chester High Road when the crash happened at around 2.10am. A Cheshire police spokeswoman said: \"The four are not family, not related. They are believed to be friends. Relatives have been notified and police family liaison officers are with them.\" The crash site has seen 59 collisions in the last three years and a sign yards away from the accident warns motorists to take extra care. It took firefighters several hours to remove the three bodies from the wreckage. The fourth victim had been thrown out of the vehicle, which is believed to have overturned several times before landing on its roof. Police have appealed for witnesses who may have seen the car in the final moments before the accident."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
