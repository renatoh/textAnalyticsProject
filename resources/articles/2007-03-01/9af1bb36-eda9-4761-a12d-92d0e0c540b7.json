Bernardo Provenzano, \"capo di tutti i capi\" since the mid-1990s, was arrested last April at a farm building near the Sicilian town of Corleone. A book published yesterday, co-authored by one of the prosecutors who captured him, reveals that putting a name and face to the mystery accomplice has become the top priority of Italy's anti-mafia investigators. Il Codice Provenzano, whose authors include a deputy chief prosecutor of Palermo, Michele Prestipino, describes the efforts made by investigators to understand the coded notes Mr Provenzano sent his lieutenants. In one, he mentioned an episode in which he had nearly been captured. But, he added, \"my Adored Jesus Christ took care of things\". The authors said it was impossible to know if the mafia chief's protector was a top politician or a spy deep inside the Italian security apparatus. The decoded messages suggest \"Jesus Christ\" also wrecked a March 2002 surveillance operation that might have helped to net Mr Provenzano. The carabinieri got wind of a Cosa Nostra summit in a farmhouse and fitted a camera. At the start of the meeting, one of the bosses made a sign to be quiet - then the surveillance team lost all sound and the camera was turned to show only the feet of those present. When Mr Provenzano was arrested, he had several extensively annotated Bibles. Last September, investigators sent them to the FBI to see if American code-breakers could make sense of them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
