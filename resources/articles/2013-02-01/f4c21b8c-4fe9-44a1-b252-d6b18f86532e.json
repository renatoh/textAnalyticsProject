More than 50 musicians are involved in the project, though the album centres around the gently thrilling vocal work of four female singers from Bulgaria. Eva Quartet are part of that remarkable choir Le Myst\u00e8re Des Voix Bulgares, famous for their spine-chilling harmonies, and the best tracks here are those where the quartet sing unaccompanied or are backed by fellow Bulgarians the Diva Reka Group. Elsewhere, Zazou surrounds their vocals with electronic effects and celebrity embellishments, ranging from the flute work of Carlos Nu\u00f1ez to the guitars of Bill Frisell and Robert Fripp, the swirling strings of the Bollywood Orchestra, and spoken sections from Laurie Anderson. Sadly, the results then mostly veer towards easy listening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
