Chances are that you'll see them as only good news. After all, why keep an old title gathering dust on the shelf when you can use it to get money off a new release? Everyone's a winner right? You get a new game for less while the shop gets a chance to make money on your old game (and with less VAT to pay as well). But what if you're a publisher, or perhaps more importantly, a developer. You only get a cut for the original sale - when the game is sold second-hand all the proceeds go to the retailer. Should you care? Yes. Speaking in trade mag MCV, EA's UK head Keith Ramsdale complained that, \"brand new product is being made to look worthless and some retail outlets are starting to look more like libraries\". While complaints from EA are unlikely to tug at your heart-strings spare a thought for the developers. Speaking in the same issue, Simon Phillips of Gusto Games reckons the increasing trend for second-hand sales can only hinder developers, who lose out on royalties when their games are sold on. In theory this could lead to even fewer risks being taken in the development process. Of course, part of this issue relates to the fact that games are generally seen as disposable. Sure, some of the classic RPGs and original titles - such as Ico - hold their value, but the majority of games are usually sold on or traded in, especially when a sequel comes along. Sports game are the worst offenders - titles like FIFA 2003 or Pro Evo 2 are practically worthless now. I went into a Game store the other day and have to agree with Ramsdale - it resembled a jumble sale. And a particularly smelly one at that. But there were some undeniable bargains to be had - I saw God of War for 15 quid - and the appeal to the punters was obvious. Clearly the trend won't go away, but with the big publishers and developers expressing concern expect to find a compromise reached between them and retail in 2006. In the meantime, enjoy those cheap games while you can."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
