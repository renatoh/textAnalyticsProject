Since 2009 Parker has been head of marginal gains at the cycling team, leading the squad's quest for perfection in areas such as diet, performance analysis and aerodynamics. The RFU has recently advertised for a head of athletic performance and sees Parker as a vital cog in its attempt to win the 2015 Rugby World Cup on home soil. \"It's a key role to fill in the shaping of the team towards 2015,\" said Lancaster on Monday. \"My role is to win now but also to build a team for the future. Someone of his [Parker's] quality would be a great addition but it isn't confirmed yet.\" Parker was unavailable for comment but the RFU is hiring a sports scientist with a record of proven success. Before Beijing Parker was the lead coach for the men's 4,000m team pursuit squad, whom he guided to a gold medal and world record in one of the defining moments of the 2008 Games. In the months after that he masterminded the programme of training and weight loss that enabled Bradley Wiggins to finish an unexpected fourth in the 2009 Tour de France. Although Parker stopped working with Wiggins at the end of 2010, he can be credited with having paved the way for the Londoner's Tour de France win this summer. Since then he has headed up a team of 15 experts looking across all areas of cycling performance. Asked during the London Olympics to sum up the cycling team's \"marginal gains\" approach, Parker said. \"We are obsessed with getting the details right; we are relentless in pursuit of it. It's not easy for other federations to do, because of the details involved. It's about everyone being the best they can be \u2013 the carer not leaving anything behind, the mechanic testing everything \u2013 but it's not just two weeks. It's two months, two years. When you put that in place, your chances of success are higher.\" The chances must be that this approach will be brought to bear on England's rugby squad \u2013 not just the players \u2013 in the run-up to the World Cup in 2015. Parker's approach to cycling performance is to break it down into its constituent parts and see what can be improved. \"My job is to keep a very long strategic look, scan the horizon,\" he said during the Games. \"What we do is increase the probability of the athletes getting their best performance. But that fractional difference at the finish between first and second \u2013 it comes from them.\" In the two years before the London Olympics the Great Britain cycling team brought in numerous innovations to provide small but significant performance gains that, when combined, would give a healthy advantage over the opposition. These included \"hot pants\" which prevented the riders' legs from cooling down between their warm-up and their race on the track. At the Athens Olympics in 2004, to combat extreme heat, they used \"cooling buckets\" in which the cyclists immersed their hands and wrists to reduce core body temperature. The marginal gains approach in London resulted in the cyclists focusing heavily on the \"golden hour\" in which the pursuit and sprint teams had their heats and finals. Over an 18-month period the coaches put together specific protocols for the time frame, making the riders do race-intensity efforts spaced at the same interval they would be on finals night. Their recovery was assessed and the programme adjusted accordingly. Specific time was allocated for all the things that would contribute to perfect recovery: hydration, protein-based recovery drinks, with a designated time \u2013 10 minutes \u2013 allotted for a debrief from the coach, whether the ride had gone to plan or not, so that post-race discussions would not eat into time needed for activities that might assist recovery. Other areas the marginal gains team have explored include sleep management, the timing of delivery of key equipment to enhance momentum, use of anti-oxidants such as fish oil and Montmorency cherries. Parker's appointment is by no means the first instance of England rugby seeking expertise from the Great Britain cycling team. Most notably, at the 2007 World Cup, the psychiatrist Steve Peters stepped in to assist Brian Ashton's team following their defeat by South Africa in the pool stage. The team went on to the final. Peters also assisted the England hooker Dylan Hartley with anger management issues resulting in an improvement in his disciplinary record. After the Beijing Games the RFU hired Mike Hughes, one of the performance analysis team within the English Institute of Sport who worked closely with the cycling squad; he is now their senior analyst. Another analyst, Duncan Locke, who has been with them two years, has a similar background to Hughes. More recently England called in Wiggins to speak to the team at a pre-autumn international training camp. Dave Brailsford, the cycling performance director, said during the weekend's World Cup event in Glasgow that he expects to lose more of his staff after the London Games than proved to be the case after Beijing. As well as now having to replace Parker, the cycling team's head of Research and Development, Chris Boardman, stepped down after London, while Peters is now allocating one day a week to UK Athletics. There is also speculation that one of the coaches from GB cycling may join Team Sky as a directeur sportif."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
