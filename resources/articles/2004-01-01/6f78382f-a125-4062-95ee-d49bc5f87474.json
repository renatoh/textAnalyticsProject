As the board at Hollinger International meets to decide whether to try to block the Barclays' bid or accept it but try to freeze the proceeds of the deal, Lord Black was sliding ever deeper into the corporate mud. Andre Bisson, a former banker in Canada, has resigned as a director and member of its audit committee \"due to a conflict\", the Toronto-based company said. He is the eighth director at Hollinger Inc to leave since Lord Black quit as the chief executive of subsidiary Hollinger International after it emerged he and other executives had pocketed \u00a319m in unauthorised payments. Shareholders in Hollinger International are furious with the disregard with which they believe Lord Black has treated their protests and to the official sale process that was launched by bankers Lazard on Friday. The Chicago Tribune today quoted \"more than one source\" close to the board saying that one of the options at today's emergency board meeting was to freeze the proceeds of the sale to safeguard its hopes of recovering payments from Lord Black, against whom it has filed a \u00a3110m lawsuit. Lord Black was sacked as Hollinger International's chairman on Saturday night in New York just 10 hours before the Tory peer shocked everyone by announcing he had agreed to bail out and sell everything including the Telegraph to the Barclays. It is unclear what powers Hollinger International will have to stop the deal going through - the Barclays are buying the company through a Canadian subsidiary and Hollinger Inc is a Canadian company whereas Hollinger International is American. Lord Black has asked a Canadian court to prevent some Hollinger International directors and the board's special committee counsel, Richard Breeden, from interfering with his deal with the Barclays. Mr Bisson's departure from Hollinger Inc comes after Saturday's resignation of three independent directors of the Argus Corporation, which, along with its parent company Ravelston, owns 78% of Hollinger Inc. The 74-year-old joined the Hollinger Inc board on Friday, just two days before Lord Black unveiled his deal with the Barclay twins. His resignation is another setback for the Hollinger Inc board, which shrank in numbers from 12 two months ago to a five-strong rump of loyalists by the start of last week. On Friday Mr Bisson and 79-year-old retired major-general Richard Rohmer arrived at Hollinger Inc, followed yesterday by former Ontario politician Gordon Walker. Before these appointments, Hollinger Inc had been hit by the departure of seven directors since the end of November. The four-strong audit committee quit en masse on November 21 after Lord Black refused to stand down as the company's chief executive. The next director to depart was Lord Black's London-based lieutenant, Dan Colson, who quit his role as vice-chairman of Hollinger Inc just before Christmas, \"to devote his full attention to the affairs of Hollinger International\". Peter Atkinson walked last week, citing \"personal reasons\", while veteran company secretary Charles Cowan announced his retirement at the same time. That left just five people on the Hollinger Inc board - Lord Black, his wife Barbara Amiel, chief operating officers David Radler and Peter White, and Jack Boultbee. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
