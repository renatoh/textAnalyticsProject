Having left Margaret Atwood\u2019s seminal source material far behind at the end of season one, the show\u2019s writers are now plotting a path for our protagonist June entirely under their own steam. The action picks up 10 minutes after the final scene of season two \u2013 here\u2019s what to expect \u2026 1. They have dialled back the \u2018torture porn\u2019 Even some ardent fans of the show abandoned season two, unable to endure its unremitting brutality, from the fake public executions to the drowning of two young lovers. Showrunner Bruce Miller has taken that on board. \u201cWe listened to the feedback, and in terms of it being too harsh, I agree. June went through a really tough year last year, and in the end she triumphed, but it was really hard,\u201d he says. This season, the on-screen brutality has been reduced. \u201cSo much of this season is about hope,\u201d says Elisabeth Moss. \u201cIt\u2019s radically important to have that for the world right now, and for our audience, to show that there is hope and that there is a way out.\u201d 2. There is a resistance in Gilead The tagline for this season is Blessed Be the Fight, and our protagonist is gearing up to take on the barbaric, oppressive Gilead regime. \u201cJune\u2019s struggle has been a very personal one until now \u2013 for survival for herself and her unborn child, and for Hannah,\u201d says the show\u2019s producer Warren Littlefield. \u201cBut having got Nicole [June\u2019s daughter in Gilead] out, it now becomes about being an active part of the resistance; what does it take to align forces to fight the Gilead regime?\u201d 3. We travel to Washington DC, where the oppression is worse The show\u2019s 2019 Super Bowl advert previewed some of the most eerie scenes from the series so far: the Washington Monument replaced with a cross, thousands of Handmaids assembled in front. Washington DC is still the centre of power in Gilead \u2013 \u201cGilead on steroids,\u201d says Littlefield \u2013 and the regime in the capital, where June, Fred and Serena all spend time, is more fundamentalist, orthodox and restrictive. 4. New depths of religious fervour means more extreme uniforms The red robes of the Handmaids have achieved significance well beyond the story, co-opted by protesters in the US, Brazil and beyond, campaigning against restrictions on women\u2019s reproductive freedoms. In Gilead\u2019s capital, the uniforms are even stricter, with all women\u2019s mouths (bar those of the Aunts) entirely covered by veils, and Handmaids\u2019 mouths pierced closed, with three rings through the lips. \u201cGilead claims that a vow of silence has been taken by the most devout Handmaids,\u201d says the show\u2019s producer, Kim Todd. 5. Even Aunt Lydia has her limits A fearsome enforcer of Gilead\u2019s oppressive regime for the past two seasons, Aunt Lydia, we shall see, has limits to her adherence. \u201cThe creepy thing about Washington, other than the veils, is that everyone seems to be so in compliance,\u201d says the actor behind Lydia, Ann Dowd. \u201cPeople have either given up or it\u2019s like in North Korea, where you don\u2019t even dare step out of line. This is not Aunt Lydia\u2019s thing. She doesn\u2019t believe in these extra, more extreme steps. She just wants to go home.\u201d The Handmaid\u2019s Tale starts on Hulu on Wednesday 5 June in the US and on Channel 4 in the UK on Sunday 9 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
