Johnson asked Von der Leyen if they were taking their masks off. She agreed that they could do so, but told him to \u201ckeep distance\u201d as they briefly removed their face coverings, prompting him to quickly step back. She added: \u201cThen we have to put it back on. You have to put it back on immediately.\u201d The PM responded as he donned his mask again: \u201cYou run a tight ship here, Ursula, and quite right too.\u201d The pair then headed off for a three-course dinner as talks on a post-Brexit trade deal remained \u201con a precipice\u201d. Flanked by his chief negotiator, David Frost, and senior aides, Johnson spelled out the UK\u2019s position, telling Von der Leyen and the bloc\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that he could not accept the terms in a treaty that would tie Britain to EU rules. EU sources told the Guardian the bloc planned to publish its no-deal contingency plans \u201cvery soon indeed\u201d in order to keep planes flying and to protect borders in the event of the talks collapsing irretrievably. The outcome of the dinner was being anxiously awaited across the continent, amid growing fears of economic and security chaos when the transition period ends in just three weeks\u2019 time. When the 27 EU heads of state and government meet on Thursday to begin a two-day summit, Von der Leyen is likely to update them on the talks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
