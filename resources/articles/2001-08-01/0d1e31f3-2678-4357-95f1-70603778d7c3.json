Fears over unemployment, an end to interest rate cuts and a cooling off in the housing market will all curb spending, according to Consumer Futures, the consumer research arm of economic analysts Business Strategies. The group predicts that growth in consumer spending has now passed its peak, and will rise at a much slower rate for at least the next two years. Inflation-adjusted spending for the third quarter of 2001 will be 3.2% higher than during the same period last year, compared to the second quarter of this year when spending was 3.8% higher than it had been in 2000. For the year as a whole, the group is forecasting a 3.4% increase in spending, followed by a 2.4% rise next year as wage inflation slows and people try to increase the amount of money they save. Dr Neil Blake, Consumer Futures research director said: \"Consumers have been the salvation, not the villains of the UK economy this year. \"While concerns over the two-speed economy have been understandable, manufacturers and the tourist industry would have suffered more - not less - if consumer demand had been weaker than it was in the first six months. \"It would be a grave mistake for the government or the Bank of England to try to reduce consumer spending now, especially since it is probably about to slow anyway.\" Associate director Melanie Lansbury added that while a slowdown in consumer spending was likely to contribute to a slowdown in the economy the effect would not be drastic and would not cause a recession. In London confidence remains high as City bonuses and the housing boom make people feel optimistic about their own finances and the state of the economy. But in areas such as Scotland and the East Midlands fears over job cuts have already led to a deterioration in confidence. According to the group consumer spending on wine is growing fastest this year, rising by 12.4%. Other areas that have seen sharp increases are life assurance and pension contributions, medical costs, foreign holidays and television and other forms of recreation. The fastest increases in the volume of goods and services consumers are buying was in audio-visual equipment, including mobile phones, which increased by 14%. Other big increases were in sales of telecommunications, clothes and shoes, and electrical goods. Consumer Futures added that falling prices meant the amount of cash consumers had to spend on these goods and services was slowly going up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
