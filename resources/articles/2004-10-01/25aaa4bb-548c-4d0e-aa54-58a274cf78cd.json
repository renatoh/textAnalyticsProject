Police say they are analysing more than 1,000 exhibits, including 59 phones and several computers. The inquiry is examining allegations of fixing involving more than 80 races over the past two years. The extension of the police bail, originally set for November 2, for the champion jockey and others among the total of 22 people arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud came amid official confirmation that none of the six more recent arrests were of Jockey Club-licensed individuals. The jockeys Fergal Lynch and Darren Williams and the trainer Karl Burke will also now answer police bail on April 2 to be questioned. Fallon, in Texas to ride Ouija Board at the Breeders' Cup meeting, was one of 16 people taken in after widespread dawn raids on September 1. He has said he was questioned about any involvement he might have had with Miles Rodgers, formerly a director of Platinum Racing Club syndicate. Rodgers was warned off for two years by the Jockey Club in March after he was found to have made substantial bets on the Betfair exchange that two of his syndicate's horses would lose. Rodgers has described the club's ruling as \"a travesty\" and denies wrong-doing. In clarifying that none of those arrested in the past few days is a jockey or trainer, City police leading the inquiry said the six included a woman from Shrewsbury, a woman from Sheffield, a Doncaster man, two men from North Yorkshire and a Bristol man. During the investigation, more than 130 officers have raided 19 addresses across Suffolk, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and Hertfordshire. Detective Chief Superintendent Steve Wilmott, leading the inquiry, said more arrests are likely. He added: \"We have made a large number of arrests and we expect to carry out more over the next few months. \"This has grown into a huge investigation and will require more time and resources to fully investigate. For this reason we have taken the decision to extend their bail to early next year.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
