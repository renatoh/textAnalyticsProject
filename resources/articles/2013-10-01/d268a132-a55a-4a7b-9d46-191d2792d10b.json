A slow start to the campaign with Gloucester has jeopardised his place in England's back row for Saturday week's Test against Australia. Morgan was the oil in Gloucester's engine in Limerick, recovering from an early gaffe when he dropped the ball into touch to return Munster's robust, physical approach with some thumping tackles. Most of what he did was not eye-catching but it did not escape the notice of the director of rugby, Nigel Davies. \"Ben has been below his own standard this season but he is getting there and I was delighted with him against Munster,\" said Davies. \"He put himself about and was in all the right places. People forget he is a young man who is only in his third full season as a full-time professional: everything had been positive for him until now and he has taken a knock. He is getting over it and what is significant is that there is far more to his game than ball-carrying.\" Morgan stood out in a much changed team that pushed Munster more closely than the scoreline suggested. Munster's head coach, Rob Penney, wondered if Davies had been looking to lull the province's players into assuming victory would be a formality by making 12 changes from the opening weekend and there was not much of the territorial, controlling rugby Munster are renowned for. Instead they made regular forays from deep that made little impression on a resolute defence. \"I was delighted with the way we played,\" said Davies. \"To be successful, you need strength in depth which means looking beyond the short-term and giving players opportunities. I am disappointed that we did not win: you have to take the referee out of the equation when you are playing in front of such a hostile crowd but we did not react to the free-for-all that was the breakdown. \"The game swung on two key moments \u2013 their tries. I cannot see how the television match official could award the first because no camera angle showed the ball being grounded while in the build-up to the second, Rob Cook was taken out in the air and we should have been awarded a penalty. Otherwise, the game was an arm-wrestle and we did not give way.\" Gloucester's scrum, taken apart by Exeter two weeks before when the prop Rupert Harden was hauled off on 36 minutes, was a source of strength. \"We did a lot of soul-searching,\" said Davies. \"We were dominant in that area and the frustration about us as a team at the moment is that we have big performances in us but also poor ones. We have to close that gap.\" Munster made up for a surprise defeat at Edinburgh the week before but they have shed a layer of skin since their days of European dominance. \"Players drove it then but we are not as experienced now,\" said the second-row Donncha O'Callaghan. \"We have to be self-critical because while we got the win we needed, we were not at the level we aspire to.\" Munster Jones (Hurley, 57; Hanrahan 66); Earls, Laulala, Downey, (Sheridan, 78) Murphy; Keatley, Murray; Kilcoyne (Cronin, 66), Varley (Sherry, 72), Botha (Archer, 75), O'Callaghan (Coughlan, 66), O'Connell, Ryan (Stander, 69), Dougall, O'Mahony (capt).
