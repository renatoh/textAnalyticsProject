Strip away this biography, though, and these songs shrivel like raisins. The Deal is a young man\u2019s fantasy of groovy hotels and suntans that lumbers like a first-timer\u2019s attempt. The weedy Good Time Gals sees a wife kindly shrugging away her husband\u2019s Stateside shagabouts. Sha-la-las and bluesy riffs, shoehorned in to sound reflective, just sound naff. There are a few moving moments: The Great Highway\u2019s girl with \u201cbright eyes like wishing wells\u201d reminding you of Davies\u2019 lyrical delicacy, plus Silent Movie\u2019s spoken-word eulogy to Big Star\u2019s Alex Chilton (Chilton told Davies a good song \u201ccheats time and makes you feel safe\u201d). The general mood, though, is one of an Alan Partridge-presented country happy hour, unsuitable all of the day and all of the night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
