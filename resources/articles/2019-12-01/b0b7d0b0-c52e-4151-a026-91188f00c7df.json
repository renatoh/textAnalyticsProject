Since joining from Lille in the summer the 24-year-old has had an impact on games chiefly as a substitute, and the winger again impressed off the bench against Bournemouth on Boxing Day. P\u00e9p\u00e9 played the final eight minutes as Arsenal earned a point in Arteta\u2019s first game in charge before hosting Chelsea on Sunday and the new Arsenal manager is certain the Ivorian has plenty to contribute. Arteta accepts the club\u2019s poor form has not aided P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s development but believes he will improve and has challenged the player to become more consistent. \u201cI think it was a big change for him to come here from France,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cHe found a team that wasn\u2019t performing at their best. The environment for him to settle wasn\u2019t ideal. It\u2019s not only about him but we are here to help him. If he\u2019s willing to learn, if he\u2019s willing to work hard, I am sure he has the potential to be top, absolutely top. [Against Bournemouth] he showed in two or three actions how good he can be. But he has to be consistent.\u201d Arteta has given every Arsenal player a clean slate, including Mesut \u00d6zil, who returned to the starting lineup at Bournemouth, but said it was difficult for P\u00e9p\u00e9 to build confidence unless he was in the XI. P\u00e9p\u00e9 has scored twice in 10 league starts but Arteta is confident the winger can recapture the form that brought 22 goals in Ligue 1 last season. \u201cThe problem with confidence is that the confidence is only good if he plays. If he trains well enough to convince me, then I have confidence in him. There has to be a mix between the two.\u201d The manager said the entire Arsenal team will help P\u00e9p\u00e9 evolve at the club. \u201cWe can\u2019t demand attacking players to generate things just like this,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cWe have to have the play sustained behind them, to tie everything together. We need to arrive in better positions as many times as possible for them to be able to create as many situations as we want. It is the overall structure, the way we play and approach the game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
