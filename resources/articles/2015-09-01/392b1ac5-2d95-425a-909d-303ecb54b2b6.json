West Ham United\u2019s fine victory had a jubilant manager, Slaven Bilic, likening his emotion to entering a hostelry \u201cfull of girls\u201d and Pellegrini visibly upset at the close of a disappointing week for his team. On Tuesday Juventus had won the opening Champions League group match here by the same scoreline. That was City\u2019s first reverse of the season. The first defeat of the league campaign arrived in similar circumstances. West Ham were dominated yet the advantage was spurned. Pellegrini\u2019s post-match verdict had the manager branding his side \u201ccrazy\u201d for the manner of West Ham\u2019s first-half goals. He admitted his frustration and told his players there could be \u201cno excuses\u201d for losing to Bilic\u2019s side at home. The visitors deserve huge credit, of course. Their victory came despite Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s memorable full debut. David Silva\u2019s late withdrawal \u2013 he strained a calf muscle in the warm-up \u2013 meant the Belgian was shifted into an attacking berth and he shone. De Bruyne controlled proceedings in a manner reminiscent of the man he replaced. The 24-year-old has similar vision to Silva but also a turn of pace that can leave an opponent trailing, which the Spaniard lacks. On this evidence the \u00a352m City paid Wolfsburg for him appears money well spent. Yet still West Ham claimed all three points. When they arrived in Manchester, City had yet to concede a goal in five Premier League outings and boasted a perfect 15 points. Bilic\u2019s men departed having ended that run by turning over a stellar XI featuring Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Yaya Tour\u00e9, Raheem Sterling, De Bruyne, Fernandinho and Joe Hart. In doing so West Ham complete an unlikely treble. To the scalps of Arsenal (2-0) and Liverpool (3-0), each defeated on their own patch, is added that of City. Bilic, who took over in the summer, is piloting the club with notable prowess. Pellegrini, though, was as close to anger as he has been since replacing Roberto Mancini two years ago. Victor Moses beat Hart in the sixth minute from 25 yards but Eliaquim Mangala and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi might have got closer to him. Diafro Sakho\u2019s finish resulted from further poor defending. Winston Reid beat Aleksandar Kolarov to a Dimitri Payet corner and headed towards Pedro Obiang. Fernandinho failed to clear and the ball fell to Sakho, who made it 2-0. Pellegrini tried to explain his post-match demeanour: \u201cIt was the frustration of the first half. It was exactly the same as Juventus. We were playing in that crazy way. We must retain our unity because we are just starting the Premier League and we must recover from this point.\u201d As well as Silva Vincent Kompany was also missing due to a calf injury. But Pellegrini was not interested in mitigation. \u201cOne thing I never do is to have an excuse about players that cannot play,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had players that could play and those players know the way they must play. They are good players, I have a strong squad and because David and Kompany could not play we cannot have excuses that we have lost to West Ham at home.\u201d Bilic, his side now in third place in the Premier League on 12 points, was understandably happy. \u201cOf course it is brilliant,\u201d he said of having outmanoeuvred Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Brendan Rodgers and now Pellegrini. \u201cIt is like when you come to a pub that is full of girls. You will like it.\u201d Can West Ham finish in the top four? \u201cHopefully. But you would be the first one to say before the season that this would be impossible,\u201d the Croatian said. \u201cBut still, just six games have gone. We have to maintain, we have to improve. There are going to be ups and downs of course. But we just have to continue working and live for every day of training and every game. Then we have a chance.\u201d Next up for the Hammers is a visit to their fellow high-flyers Leicester City, for Tuesday\u2019s Capital One Cup tie. City are also in action that evening, visiting Sunderland in the same competition. Silva does not think he can return, though Samir Nasri should again be available following a minor knock. What City require then is a prompt return to winning ways. Man of the match Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
