The high court in London on Friday ruled that Bentley Motors had infringed trademarks owned by Manchester-based Brandlogic, which owns the Bentley Clothing brand. Bentley Motors said the company was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the decision, and added it would consider an appeal. If it does not win permission to appeal, Bentley Motors could be forced to destroy its stock of branded clothing \u2013 including that worn by staff in its dealerships \u2013 or hand it over to Brandlogic. The court could also award damages. The British carmaker, which is owned by Germany\u2019s Volkswagen, makes luxury cars in Crewe whose list prices start at about \u00a3135,000 for its cheapest model, ranging to more than \u00a3275,000 before extras are added. It makes clothes to match. Bentley Motors\u2019 website still offers a variety of clothing bearing the Bentley name, including a \u00a32,400 leather jacket, knitted jumpers costing \u00a3215, and a set of matching father and child striped polo shirts for a combined \u00a3167. Lawyers for the carmaker argued that there would not be confusion between the two brands. However, in his judgment, Judge Hacon wrote that a trademark search would have revealed \u201cBentley\u201d could not be used. Bentley Clothing started trading in 1962, and its clothes have previously been sold in stores such as House of Fraser and Fenwick. It makes T-shirts, sweatshirts and hats for men, women and children, priced between \u00a325 and \u00a345. Christopher Lees, a director of Brandlogic, said he was \u201cvery relieved\u201d by the judgment, and hoped the ruling would allow him to start to grow the Bentley Clothing business, which has declined to an annual turnover of less than \u00a3100,000 from a peak of more than \u00a35m. \u201cIt has been a battle for a long time,\u201d Lees said. \u201cIt has given us a lot of hardship in my family.\u201d Brandlogic first approached the carmaker about the trademark in 1998, but Bentley Motors continued to make clothing bearing the Bentley name, and at one point made a \u201cfalse claim of ownership\u201d of the trademark, the ruling said. The judge wrote that he thought Bentley Motors made a \u201cconscious decision\u201d to gradually increase the prominence of its logo \u201cin the hope that no one stage would provoke a reaction from Bentley Clothing\u201d. In a statement, Bentley Motors said: \u201cBentley Motors was founded 100 years ago and is an internationally recognised brand operating in 60 different markets around the world. We have been selling clothing for more than 30 years in the UK and at no point has there been any evidence of confusion with another company\u2019s trademark.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
