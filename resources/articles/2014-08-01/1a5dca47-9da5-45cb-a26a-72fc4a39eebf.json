The submission is publicly available to download on the Australian Human Rights Commission website, and states: \u201cWe believe that the children [on Nauru] have been subjected to multiple violations of their human rights and wrongdoing from multiple parties.\u201d Many of the observations, including allegations of physical, verbal and sexual assault of children, inadequate child protection framework for local workers in the centre, delays in medical treatment and delays in providing basic amenities have previously been reported by Guardian Australia. But the anonymous workers\u2019 document, with redacted references to documentary evidence, contains these further observations: Childcare workers cannot remove children who are abused from detention Children are bullied and threatened by fellow detainees Save the Children staff are \u201cactively discouraged\u201d from advocating for the removal of children by their managers except \u201cin the most extreme cases of documented harm\u201d A lack of access to interpreters inhibits the capacity to conduct child protection investigations Inadequate access to food and nutrition for children Inadequate child protection training for security staff \u201cChronic\u201d understaffing, meaning children cannot be adequately supervised Family members being separated across the detention network, with some children left on Nauru while a parent receives treatment on the mainland Unaccompanied minors self-harming and a lack of clarity over who has guardianship over them There are only two bathrooms for about 200 children to share at the recently created classroom inside the detention centre Save the Children and other stakeholders are pressured to remove children from \u201cvulnerable minor management [VMM]\u201d and \u201ccomplex behaviour management [CBM]\u201d lists. \u201cConsequently, the number of children that are placed on VMM and CBM do not reflect the frequency or magnitude of mental health problems that exist in the general child population\u201d The submission also contains many shocking case studies: A young female who was at risk of a \u201cserious sexual assault\u201d after \u201cseveral adult males were overheard making plans\u201d to attack her who was moved, with her family, to different housing but was then moved back within a \u201cfew weeks\u201d. \u201cSCA [Save the Children] was informed that this was a directive from DIBP [Department of Immigration and Border Protection] and was provided with no notice to prepare the family for this transition. Despite the family\u2019s concerns regarding their safety, the family was relocated closer to the perpetrators of bullying and threats,\u201d the submission says A seven-year-old boy was separated from his mother and sister for more than a month when they were flown to the mainland for medical treatment. \u201cHe was left in the care of his father who had serious mental health problems where he absconded from the centre on numerous occasions and assaulted another minor, resulting in an overnight stay in jail and assault charges\u201d A 13-year-old boy described as \u201csocially isolated\u201d with \u201cmultiple mental health issues\u201d who was observed by other asylum seekers as \u201creceiving oral sex in the camp from another boy\u201d. No action by security guards was taken, but the boy was later observed by two guards with another child as \u201ctouching each other\u2019s groins (over clothing)\u201d. \u201cAlthough two Wilson\u2019s Security officers wrote two separate incident reports describing this behaviour, they allowed it to continue and did not stop the boys.\u201d The submission adds that the officers misidentified one of the boys. \u201cThis further demonstrates the inadequacy of training and skill to Wilson\u2019s Security officers to intervene in inappropriate sexualised contact between children and to conduct timely and accurate child protection investigations\u201d A 13-year-old girl who started menstruating on Nauru but had only two pairs of underwear; \u201cShe felt shame because ... each day she had to wash her underwear and hang them to dry in front of her father which was not culturally appropriate\u201d A Syrian father who was unable to care for his young children as he was awaiting surgery for his hernia. \u201cHe was in constant pain and the doctor had previously told him to limit his walking and talking as it would make it worse\u201d In March 2014 a group of children attending school were subjected to an \u201cattempted assault\u201d by a detention centre bus driver with a cricket bat. \u201cAlthough this bus driver was dismissed, it highlights the lack of safety that children experience from employees that are hired to assist them and protect them\u201d The submission says it has provided \u201ccomprehensive evidence of the systematic violation of their human rights and a history of wrongdoing in the Nauru offshore processing centre\u201d. A Save the Children spokesperson said, \u201cWe are on record as strongly opposing the government\u2019s decision to send children to Nauru. We know that prolonged detention of children threatens their physical, mental and emotional wellbeing. \u201cHowever, the Australian government has been very clear that no child sent to Nauru will come to Australia, so we take the pragmatic view that children accommodated there need our help. We are proud of our staff in Nauru who do their best, in an incredibly tough environment, to safeguard the rights, safety and wellbeing of children.\u201d The immigration minister, Scott Morrison, declined to comment. The Australian Greens called the report \u201cshocking\u201d and that it showed child abuse in the Nauru detention camp was \u201cout of control\u201d. The party\u2019s immigration spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young said: \u201cThe children on Nauru have to be brought back to Australia now. Every day that the government refuses to act, another child is hurt.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
