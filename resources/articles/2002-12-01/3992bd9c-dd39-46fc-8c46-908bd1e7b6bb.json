They will usually only act when cajoled into doing so, or if there is a safety issue. Designer goods' manufacturers want to achieve the cost savings of outsourcing production to poorer countries while maintaining absolute control over the manner of marketing. They, and the private enforcement agencies who represent them, often obfuscate the issue by stating that what turn out to be parallel imports are illegal counterfeits. The situation is complicated by the way the manufacturers vary the quality of branded products to suit particular markets. Many members of the public are happy to buy \"pirate\" goods sold cheaply and are in no way deceived by the counterfeiters. Such goods can be found easily at car boot sales and markets. Many branded goods' manufacturers have ignored what made their products desirable in the first place: quality and style. It is a popular joke among designer clothing suppliers that the best way to distinguish a counterfeit product from the genuine article is that the counterfeit will survive the first wash. An obvious way to reduce the incentive for counterfeiting is to make a product that offers such value for money that it becomes unprofitable for others to produce illegal copies. Tony Troy tony.troy@virgin.net A majestic site I am amazed that Lousie Ferguson can write an article about wine on the web without mentioning the best wine site (and one of the best retail sites), namely Majestic. And no, I don't have any connection with them - except as a very satisfied customer. Peter Smith peter.smith@eudoramail.com Lindows style Adrian Langford (Feedback, November 28) confuses difficulty of use with complexity of structure. When Unix became widely available and was adopted in computer science departments in the UK in the late 70s and early 80s, we were amazed at its simplicity and elegance, compared to what was around at that time. None of us dreamt, though, that 20 years later it would still be the best thing around, both technically and now, thanks to the efforts of Apple and others, in its ease of use. You don't need to open a terminal window in OS X if you don't want to, but for those familiar with Unix, or interested in learning, the fact that you can is a huge plus. The real threat to Apple's new-found geek appeal comes not from Microsoft, which most geeks I know have striven strenuously to avoid, but from Lindows, another attempt to put a pretty face on the elegant bone structure of Unix (in this case, Debian's flavour of Linux). I recently purchased the e-scape Li PC from Evesham for under \u00a3250, which comes with Lindows and OpenOffice installed. This looks like being able to do everything I need it to do at least as well and as easily as my iMac, which cost four times as much. Alistair Kilgour alistairk@blueyonder.co.uk Geek-less Mac The new Mac OS X system really is different. The only time I reboot is when I install new software, usually sent automatically from Apple. Everything on my system works fine - ADSL, Ethernet network, photo downloading from my D1, scanners, Bluetooth portability and emailing with no glitches. If anything, OS X is the geek-less system that just misses a few drivers occasionally like any other upgrading system. I can hardly remember what the Mac start-up chime sounds like. OS X works. Martin Shallcross martfoto1@btinternet.com Fast link Last week in your business solutions section, you printed an article saying satellite broadband is now affordable, starting at around \u00a325 a month. BT has no plans for installing terrestrial broadband here (Hay-on-Wye), and I would be interested in a satellite option at around the above price. Who offers this? Jon Field jon@thebear-hay-on-wye.co.uk Blurry edges Michael Cross's article (E-gov at the ready, November 21) makes sensible reading on what has been a blurry issue for the government. The prime minister's pledge at the e-summit about setting new targets for the delivery of public services via broadband is not enough to bridge the digital divide and extend the infrastructure to difficult-to-reach places such as rural England. The fact that only one in 10 Britons has used an e-government service isn't surprising: the existing structure doesn't come up to scratch. Before asking us to use these new facilities, make sure the infrastructure is there first. Don't promise motorists and ambulance crews access to broadband when the promise is a dream. What our broadband industry needs is an increase in efficiency and a decrease in costs - instead of government targets that have been set against already unmet demand levels.
