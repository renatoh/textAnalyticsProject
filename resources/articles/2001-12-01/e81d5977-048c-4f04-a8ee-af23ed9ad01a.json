Saint-Andr\u00e9, whose contract runs out at the end of the season, has guided Gloucester into the top half of the Premiership this season but there have been reports this month that he was nowhere near agreeing terms with the club's owner Tom Walkinshaw, who was balking at a reported salary demand of \u00a3200,000 a year. Cardiff want their current director of rugby Rudy Joubert to devote all his time to coaching the first team, creating a vacancy which they would like filled by Saint-Andr\u00e9, who impressed them in January in the Heineken Cup quarter-final between the clubs. The Frenchman last week declared he was considering other options but yesterday he said: \"Tom Walkinshaw has given me his 100% backing, which is nice to know.\" Gloucester expect a decision by the middle of next month. A surprise decision was made yesterday when it was announced that the 12 clubs in the Zurich Premiership would remain salary-capped for the next three years, though the limit will rise in stages from the current \u00a31.8m to nearly \u00a32m. The announcement by Premier Rugby, the organisation that runs the Premiership, was unexpected given the hostility of a number of clubs and the Professional Rugby Players' Association to the cap. The former Ireland coach Warren Gatland will decide after Christmas whether to accept an offer to take charge of Wasps' forwards. Nigel Melville, the club's director of rugby, met him this week. The Newport prop Adrian Garvey was yesterday banned for six matches by the Welsh Rugby Union after being found guilty of stamping on the Leinster outside-half Nathan Spooner at the end of the Celtic League quarter-final at Donnybrook this month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
