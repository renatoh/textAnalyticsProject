Mine was a 20-year-old Renault 5. It cost \u00a315 - cheap not because I am so incredibly old, but because we bought it from a neighbour who was (literally) on her way to the scrapyard and so it seemed only fair to give her the 15 quid she was going to get for it. It was orange with a black roof and had been driven to Algeria and back by a previous owner. The windows were ringed with green mould, it had no heating, no wipers and, amazingly, no starter motor. We had to bump it each time. To cover our embarrassment, we used to pretend it had 'just broken down' every time we went out. When my wife had to ask a heavily pregnant friend to give her a push, we knew its days were numbered. But we did get \u00a315 for it from the scrappie... Renault long ago dispatched the perky 5 to the great carpark in the sky, but its cheeky smile and can-do spirit lives on in the marque's new Modus. The Modus is an ultra-compact MPV - though you could just as usefully describe it as an ultra-roomy supermini. It's the love child of the rather unlikely union of Renault and Nissan and, like all good mongrels, it looks a little like both parents - a sort of Micra/Scenic cross. It's a five-door runaround aimed at city families who want space and agility. It is a five-seater, but the middle seat in the rear would only be comfortable if you had short legs and rubbery buttocks. Having said that, the back seats do offer endless stowage variations... in, out, shake them all about. As with all Renaults, design is paramount, and the Modus has its own distinct style. The front lights boast a pair of indicators like bright orange circumflexes, which give it a quizzical Dame Edna expression, while its steatopygic (look that one up) rear has a useful 'boot chute' - a sort of cat flap ideal for dropping in the shopping without having to heft up the hatch. It's tall for such a small car, making it easy to get in and out, especially after a heavy lunch or if you're wearing a mini skirt, perchance. It's neat and nippy - 0-60mph in 13 seconds. But it has a mpg of 26, which isn't that great really - a car this size should be cheap to run and surely more environmentally friendly. It starts at \u00a39,250 and heads up to \u00a312,600. The future for Modus looks bright. Since last September, when it was first launched, almost 90,000 have been sold - most of them in France, but with a good showing over here, too. (Renault shifted 2,488,523 units in 2004. In total, more than 62m cars were sold last year - no wonder we're all going nowhere fast.) There are, of course, a few frustrating niggles. It has a baffling stereo, a horrid wobbly gear stick and the most vicious brakes I've encountered since I knocked my front teeth out on a Raleigh Chopper. And the seats are beige which, if trend analysts are to be believed, is the 'big new colour for 2005'. Yuk... Anyway, now I've re-lived my first car, maybe it's time to track down that first girlfriend..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
