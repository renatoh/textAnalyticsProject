Derby's Pride Park will host its first full international when Mexico visit on Friday May 25, 12 days before the Greece game. White Hart Lane will be the venue for the Wednesday match against Holland on August 15, just over a fortnight before the visit to Germany. Tottenham have not staged a senior international since 1949. The choice of opponents follows consultation by the Football Association with Eriksson and the Leicester manager Peter Taylor, who remains part of England's coaching team. \"Both agreed that Mexico will provide the most suitable opposition as part of their preparation for the World Cup qualifying fixture in Greece,\" the FA said. Holland are deemed similar in approach to the Germans. Eriksson will now take charge of nine games in just over seven months between the friendly against Spain at Villa Park on February 28 and the final qualifier at home to Greece on October 6. Two important qualifiers at home to Finland and away to Albania await in late March. \"We are keen to qualify for the World Cup,\" stressed the FA's chief executive Adam Crozier. \"But the most important thing is that every time we play we are improving and moving in the right direction.\" Mexico lie 12th in Fifa's rankings, one place below Germany and five ahead of England. Their visit is due six days after this season's final Premiership fixtures and two days after the Champions League final. The FA's choice of Pride Park reflects the fact that the stadium has been filled twice in the past two years for England Under-21 matches. A couple of days after facing Mexico, Eriksson will take his squad to southern Spain for a week-long training camp to acclimatise to the heat expected in Greece on June 6. Holland's visit comes just after the start of the new Premiership season, which may anger managers. Semi-finalists in Euro 2000, the Dutch have made a disappointing start to their own qualifying campaign under Louis van Gaal, drawing and losing at home to Ireland and Portugal respectively. Eriksson will begin his sweep of Premiership grounds at Upton Park on Saturday, where West Ham play Sunderland. In November the Swede admitted he did not know the name of Sunderland's left-back, so Michael Gray will hope to return after injury. Meanwhile, wearing his Leicester hat, Taylor hopes to make Roberto Mancini, 36, the Premiership's latest high-profile foreign recruit but concedes his club may not be able to afford the Italian's wages. Mancini left his player-coach's role at Lazio yesterday after being overlooked in favour of Dino Zoff to succeed Eriksson as head coach. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
