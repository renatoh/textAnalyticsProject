Yet this is precisely what happened in the 1956 Belgian grand prix at Spa-Francorchamps, to the highly regarded automotive writer Paul Fr\u00e8re, who has died aged 91. However Fr\u00e8re was no chance selection by the flustered Ferrari team manager Eraldo Sculati. On the Wednesday before the race, Sculati telephoned Fr\u00e8re at his home in Brussels saying: \"Please come to Spa. Mr Ferrari wants you to take over Luigi Musso's car.\" The fact that the Italian driver had just broken an arm crashing a Ferrari sports car at the N\u00fcrburgring was brushed aside, the only consideration being who could take his place in the next race only a few days later. Fr\u00e8re had already finished fourth behind his team-mate Giuseppe Farina in the 1955 Belgian race, the two Ferraris completely eclipsed by the Mercedes W196s of Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss, which ran away to take first and second positions. Initially Fr\u00e8re thanked Sculati, but declined. \"I flatly refused the offer, telling him that I had not driven a formula one for a whole year, and did not want to make a fool of myself in front of the Belgian public ... And to make it quite clear, I stayed at home while first practice took place. My main job was to be a motor journalist and I had to make my report for the paper Sports Moteurs. This forced me to go to the circuit and after long hesitation, I took my helmet with me.\" After inquiring whether he might take a few laps in one of the Lancia-Ferrari D50s, and reasoning that the experience might give him some excellent insight for journalistic purposes, it was only a short hop to being cajoled into racing the car, which he duly did with distinction, finishing a strong second to British world championship contender Peter Collins. Born in Le Havre, France, Fr\u00e8re was by nationality a Belgian and trained as an engineer, eventually starting out on a racing career on two wheels in 1946 on the Spa-Francorchamps circuit, where he also drove an elderly 10-year old MG PB in the 24-hour race. In 1952, driving for HWM, Fr\u00e8re won the non-championship Grand Prix des Fronti\u00e8res at Chimay in 1952. He also raced for Jaguar and Aston Martin, steering a Jaguar D-Type to second place in the 1956 Rheims 12 Hours in 1956 with Mike Hawthorn, then won the race for Ferrari in 1957 and 1958, with compatriot Olivier Gendebien. In 1960 came his crowning achievement when he shared a Ferrari 250TR to win the Le Mans 24 Hours co-driving with Gendebien. That year he also triumphed in the non-title South African grand prix. He retired at the end of the season, aged 43, to take over the prestigious role of European editor with Road &amp; Track, the leading US motor sports magazine. Fr\u00e8re found it difficult to slow down. At 89, he suffered multiple fractures when he somersaulted a Honda Civic type-R during testing at the N\u00fcrburgring. Two months before his death he was preparing a review of his 1956 Belgian grand prix performance. He is survived by his wife Suzanne. \u00b7 Paul Fr\u00e8re, journalist and racing driver, born January 31 1917; died February 24 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
