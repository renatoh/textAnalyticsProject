Nine fires are currently burning at watch and act level, and one at emergency level (the Little L complex fire). The Three Mile fire was at emergency level at 2pm, but was later downgraded to watch and act. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, rejected suggestions that volunteer firefighters should be professionalised, or that the federal government should do more, saying the firefighters \u201cwant to be there\u201d. Cricketers playing in the Sheffield Shield at the SCG said the air was \u201ctoxic\u201d and called on the sport to review its air quality policy. Buildings all over Sydney \u2013 including RFS headquarters \u2013 were evacuated as the smoke triggered fire alarms. The maximum temperature in Sydney today was 42.4C in Richmond. The dropped to 28C by 4pm, due to a sweeping southerly. An emergency warning has just been issued for the Little L Complex fire, in Yengo national park. This is the first fire to worsen this evening, after others were downgraded during the day. There is increasing fire in the Glenroy Estate area, near Putty Rd, the RFS says. Earlier today, Sheffield Shield cricketers at the SCG said it was \u201ctoxic\u201d playing in heavy smoke. Footage was dramatically hazy but the game was not called off. Queensland captain Usman Khawaja said it was \u201chard to breathe\u201d and New South Wales spinner Steve O\u2019Keefe said Cricket Australia needed to take action and look at its air quality policy. \u201cFor someone like me who smokes 40 a day, it\u2019s now smoking 80 cigarettes a day,\u201d he told AAP. \u201cThe one thing they need to look at is the air quality policy. It\u2019s not healthy. It\u2019s toxic ... that was shocking. I don\u2019t have kids but if I did they\u2019d be locked up inside, and if I was at home I wouldn\u2019t be training or playing.\u201d That rain could fall over fires near Grafton, and the Bangala Creek fire, which is at watch and act, near Tenterfield. Still waiting on an RFS update on this. A severe thunderstorm warning has just been issued for parts of the mid-north coast and inland. That includes the possibility of hail. Doctors from some of Sydney\u2019s hardest hit areas have spoken to Melissa Davey about the impacts they are seeing in patients. Dr Kim Loo works in Rouse Hill, which recorded some of the worst air quality ratings today. \u201cMy poor patients, many live on the margins of poverty,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey live in houses that aren\u2019t sealed. I know there are guidelines telling people to stay inside if they have certain health conditions, but that\u2019s no good if your house isn\u2019t sealed and you can\u2019t afford an air filter.\u201d At Circular Quay, ferries are severely delayed and passengers are being told they are running 30 minutes or more late. This comes after cancellations due to bushfires earlier in the day. The southerly has hit the Green Wattle firegrounds. And read this from Katharine Murphy: Dear prime minister. The country is not parched but desiccated, and it is burning like a tinderbox, and people are frightened. They are frightened about today and the terrible business of defending property and saving lives, and they are frightened about whether this is what spring and summer in Australia now looks like. NSW Health has put out a statement urging people to \u201ctake precautions to protect their health\u201d. \u201cNSW Health is particularly reminding the elderly and parents and carers of young children to stay inside with doors and windows shut, where possible, and postpone outdoor activities,\u201d said the chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant. \u201cThe best way to reduce exposure to smoke is to stay indoors with the doors and windows shut. People with existing lung and heart conditions can also protect themselves by following their disease management plans.\u201d The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, has told people to follow the NSW Health advice. Sydney\u2019s ferries are running again but there\u2019s still a reduced service on many routes. The ACT\u2019s emergency services agency has tweeted this map. More smoke is heading Canberra\u2019s way. The website advises: \u201cA change in wind direction has caused the smoke to blow across the ACT region.\u201d If you\u2019re wondering if you should get an air purifier \u2013 and from where \u2013 this explainer from Martin Farrer has some info. In short, they need to have a HEPA filter, but their effectiveness varies. And in many parts of Sydney, they are sold out. 5pm update from RFS: 83 fires burning across NSW, 40 uncontained. 12 are at watch and act. Tomorrow there are three areas with total fire bans (central ranges, northwestern and northern slopes). Potential respite coming tomorrow for Sydney \u2013 but not every part of the state. Temperatures have dropped across the state as a southerly change has come through in the past few hours. But that most likely will worsen fire conditions and make the job harder for firefighters on the ground. Unlucky. This is Naaman Zhou taking over the blog from Helen Davidson. Former fire chief Greg Mullins has warned that firefighters may have \u201cnothing left in the tank\u201d as they battle with an abnormally long and extensive fire season. He told AAP: \u201cEveryone is getting pretty worn out and in my experience that\u2019s where all the bad stuff happens. The troops, if they\u2019re worn out, you get to a stage where it just overwhelms everyone, so that\u2019s a worry. \u201cI\u2019m buggered ... and I haven\u2019t done as many [shifts] as some people. People will step up. Firefighters \u2013 they are men and women who give their all \u2013 they will do whatever is asked of them and more, but I do fear for their welfare.\u201d Last month Mullins and 23 other former fire chiefs said the government had ignored their warnings because it \u201cfundamentally doesn\u2019t like talking about climate change\u201d. Mike Bowers is down in Braidwood where firefighters have been battling a large fire. It\u2019s at a watch-and-act level. Our data team has updated their graph of total area burned in NSW. There\u2019s a fuller story here, but it\u2019s worth this quick explanation of what happened in 1974 when 3.5m hectares burned, and how this differs. Scientists says fire conditions today are fundamentally different, and fundamentally worse in many ways, when compared with some of the fires in the past. The director of the University of Wollongong\u2019s centre for environmental risk management of bushfires, Ross Bradstock, says the 1974 fires burned through largely remote country mostly in the state\u2019s far west, devouring green, non-woody herbaceous plants. The conditions were created by above average rainfall which produced ample fuel in outback grasslands. By contrast, the fires in the east of the state this year have been fuelled by a lack of rain. The extent of the fires is in significant part driven by the amount of dry fuel available, some of it in highly unlikely places, and the amount of dry fuel is linked to the record-breaking drought. Here are the new or upgraded ones: \u2022 A blaze near Cessnock, which is being referred to as the Crumps Complex fire, is burning in the Corrabare state forest, east of Wollombi. It is being controlled but has burned through more than 5,000ha and fire activity has increased on the western side of the fire, near Narone Creek. \u2022 Directly west of the large Gospers Mountain fire, at Palmers Oaky in the Lithgow council area, an out-of-control fire has gone through more than 600ha. The Bangala Creek fire near Tenterfield has been upgraded and is burning out of control after a storm cell above the fireground caused erratic winds and increased fire activity. The Palerang fire near Braidwood is \u201cbeing controlled\u201d but was upgraded to a watch and act this afternoon. Fire activity is increasing around Foxs Elbow and Watsons Road. Two grass fires have sparked at Corrys Road and Meander Street in Thurgoona, near Albury. The Three Mile fire on the Central Coast has been downgraded to a watch and act, thanks to firefighting efforts. Fire and rescue station 505 at Wyong has released some comparison stats on bushfire emergencies in recent decades. This is by far the biggest in terms of area burnt (but is a distant second after the disastrous Black Saturday fires in terms of lives and homes lost). \u201cThis information shows the sheer destruction that has occurred and could have been worse if it wasn\u2019t for everyone doing their bit,\u201d it said. 1994 January - 800,000ha burnt - 225 homes lost - 4 lives lost 2001 Black Christmas, 25 Dec 2001 - 7 Jan 2002 - 753,000ha burnt - 109 homes lost - 433 out (non-house) buildings destroyed 2003 January - 160,000ha burnt - 470 homes destroyed - 4 lives lost 2009 Black Saturday, Vic, 7 Feb - 14 Mar - 450,000ha burnt - 2029 homes lost - 3,500-plus out buildings destroyed - 180 lives lost 2013 October - 118,000ha burnt - 248 buildings destroyed - 40 out buildings destroyed - 2 lives lost 2019 July to December and still burning - 2.7m ha burnt - 684 homes lost - 1452 out buildings destroyed - 6 lives lost This morning Scott Morrison addressed media and dismissed calls for greater federal support of the bushfire response and of volunteer firefighters. It came after the opposition and Malcolm Turnbull called for a restructured nationally coordinated response, with the latter saying the threat was now a \u201cnational security issue\u201d, as well as a growing concern from the community about volunteers being in the field for weeks or months with no end in sight. The Australasian fire and emergency service authorities council (Afac) said this afternoon: \u201cAustralia has never been better prepared to face natural disasters.\u201d Afac, which counts fire and emergency management professions as members, said cross-state firefighting resources were funnelled and distributed across the country where they had been requested, by its national resource sharing centre. \u201cWhile many volunteers are not available to travel far from their homes or interstate due to local responsibilities, employment or managing drought-stricken stock that require daily feeding, others are prepared to deploy,\u201d Afac said. It said there was integrated engagement with the commonwealth and national protocols for managing incident responses and the available fleet of 140 aircraft and international personnel. \u201cNone of this comes with guarantees. However, a great deal is in place and has been practised, providing Australia with a truly national capability drawn from state and territory agencies from across the commonwealth.\u201d A quick update from Victoria, where there are also several fires burning out of control in the East Gippsland region. From AAP: Several fires burning across Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland region have been downgraded to advice level, but remain out of control. Firefighters are still tackling bushfires in the towns of Ensay and Timbarra, about 340km north-east of Melbourne. Fire crews are assessing the spread of the fire and developing strategies to tie it into existing containment lines. Aircraft are also monitoring the areas, as well as the nearby towns of Buchan, Buchan South, Sunny Point, who have also had their fire danger downgraded to advice level. A watch-and-act warning was in place early Tuesday morning after a blaze began during Monday\u2019s extreme heat in Timbarra. Residents were also advised to stay indoors as a precaution. Another 10 bushfires are burning across the state, covering about 47,000ha, according to the Country Fire Authority. \u201cThe fires mainly cover remote forest regions, where extreme dryness and rough terrain is making it difficult for firefighters to reach,\u201d a spokeswoman said. Northern and north-east Victoria remains at very high bushfire risk despite the cool change overnight. Guardian Australia photographer Mike Bowers is in Braidwood where a fire is at a watch and act level. The University of NSW has also closed some its campuses, but not all. It has clarified some reporting out there to say that only its Biological Sciences north and south campuses have shut down \u201cto avoid further disruption\u201d. There are many organisations involved in the bushfire response effort. Marine Rescue teams have been on standby to provide backup for the RFS and SES on the Hawkesbury for the past few days. The organisation\u2019s volunteers know the river, and where properties are, and they can increase the radio communication coverage and coordinate resupplies. On Saturday Marine Rescue\u2019s Peter Moore told me they sent three vessels out to where the Three Mile fire was burning along Mangrove Creek. Between them, the SES and others about 20 boats were stationed about 1km apart in case residents needed to get out quickly. \u201cThe residents along the road had no way of getting out easily \u2013 the winds are variable \u2013 so they just wanted every contingency covered,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if we have to move people, we had the facility without too much fuss.\u201d That part of Sydney has about 2,000 people without road access to their properties. \u201cIt\u2019s the third time we\u2019ve been deployed,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe went out on the previous two hot days. You had this feeling of impending doom. The smoke was that thick you couldn\u2019t see the side of the river. We used radar. \u201cLuckily we weren\u2019t needed.\u201d We looked earlier at the overall air quality index but the numbers for the PM2.5 particles (the ones small enough to get deep into the lungs and into the bloodstream) are pretty shocking across the state. Health department data measures rolling 24-hour averages, and in the past few hours a number of regions have bounced into the red \u201chazardous\u201d zone, which is above 200. Armidale in the northern tablelands has hit 542, and to the south-west in Tamworth it has reached 428. Goulburn in the southern tablelands is also extraordinarily high at 462. Most of the greater Sydney region is also in the red, with measurements above 300 across the north-west except in Rouse Hill where it has hit 430. Sydney\u2019s east ranges from 157 in Earlwood to 353 in Macquarie Park. Sydney University\u2019s campuses at Camden and Molonglo are still closed to staff, students and visitors, after being evacuated last Thursday. A limited number of staff attending to the critical care of animals were allowed access to the sites this morning, the uni said, but those people had pre-approval from their line managers and security. People are being told not to return until at least tomorrow. A quick update of the current fire situation as that southerly change starts moving through the state. Emergency level: The Three Mile fore, in the central coast, has burned through more than 31,000ha. Watch and Act level: The Gospers Mountain fire, in the Hawkesbury, has burned through more than 319,000ha. The Green Wattle Creek fire, south-west of Warragamba Dam Wall in the Blue Mountains national park, has burned through more than 109,000ha. The Kerry Ridge fire, near Muswellbrook, has burned through more than 53,400ha. The Little L Complex fire at Singleton has burned through more than 65,900ha. There are 86 other fires burning. In the context of those health warnings we\u2019ve just heard, here\u2019s the Climate and Health Alliance - a coalition of healthcare stakeholders lobbying for climate change action as a health issued. From a NSW Ambulance Service spokesman: \u201cIn conditions like these, New South Wales ambulance is responding to between 70 and 100 instances of respiratory illness per day, from asthma to emphysema. \u201cToday they\u2019ve treated a 93-year-old woman in northern Sydney and a 23-year-old woman in western Sydney, both of whom had pre-existing asthma conditions. \u201cBoth of those patients did not have their asthma medication with them. To the vulnerable people in the community \u2013 that is children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions that are either respiratory or cardiac-related \u2013 we encourage them to say indoors and to have their medications with them. These conditions should not be taken lightly.\u201d NSW Health is addressing the media, urging people to stay indoors and seek out air-conditioned environments. The air quality is up there with the worst they\u2019ve ever seen, and the southerly change is expected to bring \u201csome relief\u201d. Sydney has experience poor air quality episodes before, for instance the 2009 dust storm, but this smokey period for the past month is \u201cunprecedented\u201d. \u201cMost people are going to be experiencing this as sore eyes, nose and throat, or perhaps a bit of a cough, but there are other people who will find it makes their symptoms worse,\u201d Dr Richard Bruen said. \u201cFor example, if you do have asthma or emphysema, it could your respiratory condition worsen.\u201d Asked about the utility of face masks, they\u2019ve said the \u201cloose fitting material masks\u201d don\u2019t really have a material effect but the P2 or N95 masks are \u201cin theory effective\u201d but need to have a really good fit. I\u2019m going to hand you over to my colleague Helen Davidson now. Thanks for reading. As expected, conditions are worsening as the temperatures drop along with the strong gusty winds moving up through NSW from the south. The latest air quality figures have gone live. This covers 12pm - 1pm AEDT, so it\u2019s still half an hour behind. The maximum AQI has dropped in Sydney city\u2019s centre (Cook and Phillip) and east (Randwick). Those were hitting over 2000 between 10-11 but are now down to maximums of 1223 and 907. That is still four to five times the hazardous level. They remain over 2000 in the west, at Richmond and St Marys. That\u2019s up to 11 times hazardous. Parramatta North has dropped marginally to 1719. Hazardous levels begin at 200. The NSW Rural Fire Service has issued an emergency warning for the Three Mile fire near the Hawkesbury River on the state\u2019s central coast. The RFS said the fire has merged with another Wrights Cree fire and was increasing in the areas of Central Mangrove and Kulnura. It said if you are in those areas it is now too late to leave. Seek shelter as the fire approaches and protect yourself from the heat. \u201cConditions are expected to deteriorate today with fire expected to spread to the east and north after a southerly change,\u201d the RFS said. For other areas affected, the Gosford RSL Club has been set up as an evacuation centre. While the cricketers play on, the smoke has forced the cancellation of the traditional Sydney to Hobart lead-up race for safety reasons. A spokeswoman for Transport for NSW said all Sydney ferry services were suspended and vessels would remain in port until the smoke lifted. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know when that is going to be. It will be when the smoke lifts and we get the all-clear for the ferry services to resume.\u201d Replacement bus services are running between Manly and Circular Quay. For passengers on other routes, passengers are advised to seek alternative public transport. Steve O\u2019Keefe still rolling the arm over despite Sydney\u2019s big end of the world energy. From Kensington in Sydney\u2019s south-east. In some good news, the thick smoke is preventing fire conditions from worsening. But they may worsen in the afternoon as strong winds pick up. Some live footage from today\u2019s Sheffield Shield game at the SCG. Nearly empty stands, almost invisible players. The offices of the Sydney Morning Herald are being evacuated, after their smoke alarm went off. Sydney\u2019s ferries have now been cancelled due to the smoke. Buses are replacing ferries. Sydney\u2019s air quality has reached as high as 11 times the hazardous level, according to the state\u2019s monitoring index. The worst reading is currently at Macquarie Park in Sydney\u2019s north-west, which recorded air quality of 2,214 between 9am and 10am this morning. Any air quality index reading above 200 is considered hazardous. Prospect in Sydney\u2019s north reached 2,075 and Parramatta North has reached 2,024 with levels continuing to rise. Liam Gallagher is in Sydney and has weighed in on the smoke. A few views of Sydney... Severe heatwave conditions combined with \u201cgrotty\u201d smoke pollution will put stress on vulnerable people in the coming days, authorities have warned. The haze may cause breathing issues for those with heart or lung disease, while Sydneysiders have been encouraged to stay indoors and avoid exercise. NSW Health environmental health director Dr Richard Broome said Tuesday would be \u201cvery hot and very smoky\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be putting a lot of stress on vulnerable people, particularly elderly people who have existing heart and lung conditions,\u201d Broome told reporters. Asked about concerns about the time that volunteer firefighters are being asked to continue volunteering without pay, and reports they\u2019re crowd-sourcing funds for water and food on the ground, the prime minister Scott Morrison rejected the suggestion the federal government could do more. Speaking in Sydney a few minutes ago Morrison said: No, I don\u2019t share that view because I know what the practice is and I know what the experience is and I know what\u2019s happening on the ground and I know that whether it\u2019s the ADF or any other agency of the commonwealth, all of those agencies, our efforts have been channelled and coordinated [into] the response of the state and territory staff on the ground. That is what is set up. That is what was intended to be set up and that is operating and I\u2019m pleased with the way those arrangements are being worked out and if there is any other matter that would need to be addressed, it would be raised with the commonwealth, because there is a direct line to make sure that happens. He also rejected suggestions the country\u2019s volunteer firefighting forces should be professionalised: We are constantly looking at ways to better facilitate the volunteer effort, but to professionalise that at that scale is not a matter that has previously been accepted and it\u2019s not currently under consideration by the government. But as is the case with all fire events, or as is the case with all flood events and other natural disasters, this nationally coordinated effort is designed to constantly look at those issues, post these events. Smoke alarms continue to go off at random because of the thick smoke covering so much of Sydney and the rest of the state. Parts of the University of New South Wales have had to be evacuated, as has Fisher Library at the University of Sydney and the ABC\u2019s Central Coast studio which has been evacuated twice on Tuesday morning. https://twitter.com/alix_thoeming/status/1204197285497733120 Elsewhere, fog horns are going off across Sydney harbour as ferries try to find their way through the thick haze. Air quality across NSW continues to decline. By 9am PM2.5 fine particle readings had reached \u201cvery poor\u201d to \u201chazardous\u201d in much of Sydney, the Hunter and central coast and Illawarra regions. The worst readings, between 262 and 337 on the air quality index over a 24-hour rolling average, have been in the north-west around Richmond and St Marys. Some parts of Sydney have recorded levels of 1789 on the index, where anything above 200 is considered hazardous. Most of the upper Hunter, and the central, southern and northern tablelands are also experiencing hazardous air quality, according to the Department of Planning and Environment. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with what a PM2.5 fine particle is, my colleague Naaman Zhou has helpfully explained it here: The Green Wattle Creek fire burning in Wollondilly west of Sydney has now been upgraded to watch and act. The fire has already burned through about 100,000ha. The RFS says the fire is burning on both sides of Lake Burragorang and that activity is increasing across the fireground. Quite a few reports of this today, now it appears the RFS headquarters in Sydney has been briefly evacuated after smoke alarms were triggered. Sydneysiders love to refer to the glory index; that is, how glorious the city is looking on any given day. Sad to report that, like the air quality, today\u2019s is very, very low. Meanwhile in Victoria there are still 12 bushfires burning, with evacuation warnings still in place in the state\u2019s East Gippsland region. A watch-and-act warning remains in place for residents on the Timbarra settlement, about 340km north-east of Melbourne, after a blaze began during Monday\u2019s extreme heat. \u201cDon\u2019t wait, leaving now is the safest option \u2013 conditions may change and get worse very quickly,\u201d the warning reads on Tuesday morning. A bushfire directly south of Timbarra, in the town of Ensay, is also out of control with a watch-and-act warning in place for residents in Ensay North, Holstons and Reedy Flat. About 100 firefighters are working to put out the blaze, with an emergency warning downgraded overnight, AAP reports. Another 10 bushfires are burning across the state, covering about 47,000ha, according to the Country Fire Authority. \u201cThe fires mainly cover remote forest regions, where extreme dryness and rough terrain is making it difficult for firefighters to reach,\u201d a spokeswoman said. Northern and north-east Victoria remains at very high bushfire risk despite the cool change overnight. The Gospers Mountain fire has already merged with the fire at Kerry Ridge further north, but as the RFS map shows there is a real possibility that it could also join with the fire at Three Mile Creek. That would create a huge fire front for firefighters. Two more blazes \u2013 the Kerry Ridge fire near Muswellbrook in the Hunter Valley and the Three Mile fire on the central coast \u2013 have been upgraded to watch and act by the Rural Fire Service. The Three Mile fire has merged with the separate Wrights Creek fire. The RFS says the fire is increasing in the area of Bloodtree Road at Kulnur. The Kerry Ridge fire continues to burn within the Wollemi national park but has now moved east into the Putty state forest, as well as west into the Coricudgy state forest. The RFS says the blaze, in combination with the Gospers Mountain fire, has moved towards some isolated rural properties. The NSW Rural Fire Service has updated the status of the mega blaze at Gospers Mountain on the central coast to watch and act, saying activity has \u201cincreased across the fireground\u201d. There are a number of fires burning across the Hawkesbury, including at Gospers Mountain where the fire is burning between Newnes and Wisemans Ferry, Putty (St Albans) and Central Colo. The fire has burned through more than 319,000 hectares. \u201cConditions are expected to deteriorate today. This may see the fire spread to the east and north following a southerly change,\u201d the RFS says. The smoke isn\u2019t just affecting Sydney, believe it or not. Here\u2019s two pictures of the same view across the Hawkesbury River on the NSW central coast. The first, which shows backburning operations, was taken last night. The second, which shows nothing, is from this morning. Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke to reporters from smoke-covered Sydney on Tuesday. \u201cAs we can see here, standing on the lawn in Sydney, there are fires across Australia today, particularly here in New South Wales with a mega fire to our north-west which I had the opportunity to be briefed on on the weekend when I visited Wilberforce and the control centre there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut up in Queensland, in Victoria, in South Australia, there are heatwave conditions here on the east coast today. I would just ask, as always, these fires have been going on for months now, not just weeks, and to continue to follow the instructions of fire authorities in your respective states, to be aware of the information that has been provided.\u201d Our Canberra photographer Mike Bowers took these shots of the sun setting through a cloud of bushfire smoke hanging over Parliament House on Monday evening. Andy Ball has made several updates to our map which demonstrates the immense scale of the bushfires. The area burned in NSW and Queensland is now a staggering 2.9m hectares, which is larger than many small countries \u2013 somewhere around the size of Albania. We also had many requests from people to add more locations for comparison, so it is now possible to reposition the map, and Andy has added a larger number of cities. NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay thanks the more than 2,000 firefighters on the ground across the state. \u201cWe know you are weary,\u201d she writes. The bushfire smoke has delivered a haunting sunrise over Parliament House in the nation\u2019s capital. The Bureau of Meteorology says a southerly wind this afternoon will help ease the smoke choking Sydney this morning, though it may not help firefighters battling blazes across the rest of the state. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has just been speaking about the bushfire crisis. He says there are 111 aircraft working to battle fires not just in NSW but also in Victoria and Queensland. Emergency assistance payments have been running now for some time and I must say I\u2019ve been incredibly impressed by the coordination that has occurred between our states and territories, with great support from those from overseas. We\u2019ve had firefighters here from New Zealand, from Canada, from the United States, and they will be out there assisting in so many different roles again today. So I would ask people to take great care and to follow the advice and warnings that have been provided and to stay safe and to exercise appropriate judgment, particularly with fire conditions being the way they are today. Our thoughts are with all of those who are out there doing their job today. Sydney has again woken to a thick blanket of smoke, with officials issuing a \u201cpoor\u201d air quality alert for the city on Tuesday morning. By 5am, air quality was graded as \u201cvery poor\u201d to \u201chazardous\u201d in parts of Sydney\u2019s north-west and south-west as well across the Hunter and Central Coast regions. Air quality also remained \u201cvery poor\u201d in Lismore in the state\u2019s north. Good morning, New South Wales is staring down another difficult day of bushfire danger, with smoke pollution set to smother Sydney and temperatures to soar past 40C. The Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, warned on Monday that while wind conditions won\u2019t be as difficult as previous high fire danger days, that could be cancelled out by the high temperatures and low humidity expected on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as the catastrophic weather we had weeks ago but it\u2019s certainly going to be another difficult day, particularly given the scale and complexity of these fires and their proximity to so much more built-up and populated areas,\u201d he told reporters on Monday. Almost 3,000 firefighters will be deployed to fight the more than 80 bushfires which continue to burn across the state, including a so-called mega-fire north-west of Sydney, which was formed when the huge Gospers Mountain blaze merged with the neighbouring Little L Complex, Paddock Run, Three Mile and Kerry Ridge fires. Total fire bans are in place for nine regions across NSW on Tuesday, including in Sydney, amid fears that temperatures in the high 30s to 40s and strengthening winds will fuel existing fires and potentially ignite new ones. Along with Sydney, total fire bans are in place with \u201csevere\u201d fire danger forecast in the Hunter, Illawarra/Shoalhaven, southern ranges, central ranges, Monaro Alpine and the ACT."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
