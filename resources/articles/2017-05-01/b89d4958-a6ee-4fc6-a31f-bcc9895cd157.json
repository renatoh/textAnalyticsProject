Over the past century, millions of people have braved violence, intimidation and other obstacles to demand the right to express their will through the ballot box. The result was a heartening increase in the number of countries that could be described as democratic. But in the past few years, the trend has reversed: countries such as Turkey, Poland and Hungary that are nominally democratic \u2013 in the sense they hold regular elections \u2013 have succumbed to various degrees of authoritarian rule. Freedom House, an independent watchdog dedicated to the expansion of freedom and democracy, which monitors political activity in 195 countries, says 2016 was \u201cthe 11th consecutive year of decline in global freedom\u201d. Western societies regard themselves as immune to this illiberal trend, on the assumption that their electoral systems are beyond reproach. This is dangerous hubris. To be truly democratic, elections have to be both free and fair. Fairness requires that electoral contests take place on a level playing field, yet in the past two decades that field has become dangerously tilted by the influence of campaign funding. In the US, it is estimated that members of Congress spend between 30% and 70% of their time raising money to get elected or re-elected and most of that money comes from the 0.01% of the population, who donated more than $10,000 to an electoral campaign, or from the 132 Americans who provided 60% of the Super PAC funding in the 2012 election cycle. This is government of the people by the super-rich. Popular revulsion at the dysfunctional Congress that is the result of this skewed funding was one of the factors that led to the election of Donald Trump, a candidate who made much of the fact that he was, supposedly, running on his own money and beholden to no one. The UK has ostensibly strict rules on campaign funding administered by the Electoral Commission, which is charged with ensuring the income and spending of campaigners is transparent, controlling the sources of political funding and limiting spending at elections and referendums. But an investigation by this paper\u2019s Carole Cadwalladr into the Brexit referendum campaign suggests the commissions\u2019s rules were either irrelevant or easily circumvented by the Leave campaign. Her stories reveal that new forms of online campaigning based on exploiting citizens\u2019 social media data have not only changed the ways that political parties target voters but have also increased the risk that big money \u2013 some of it of foreign origin \u2013 may manipulate political debate in the UK. In a pre-internet era, lavish funding could buy advantages for particular political groups \u2013 more and better TV advertising in the US, for example; high-quality print and billboard advertising; resources for supporting leafleting, canvassing, getting out the vote; and so on. But in an online world, campaign funding can buy more powerful kinds of advantage, especially by enabling the targeting of individual voters based on their social media and related profiles. And the requisite databases can be constructed way before a campaign begins, which is why that kind of expenditure is not seen by the Electoral Commission and why campaign financing by foreign interests may stay invisible. That a regulator\u2019s rules and terms of reference have been rendered obsolete by technological change is nothing new. But the combination of uncontrolled campaign funding and digital technology poses worrying problems for democracy. It is unlikely that the outcome of the referendum was determined solely by online campaigning, but there is now a technological arms race under way. We\u2019re in the middle of a general election campaign, the outcome of which will probably determine who governs Britain for some time. If we don\u2019t want our futures to be determined by technology, then we need to recognise the scale and seriousness of the problem. A tech-savvy Electoral Reform Commission would be a good place to start. \u2022 Comments will be opened later"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
