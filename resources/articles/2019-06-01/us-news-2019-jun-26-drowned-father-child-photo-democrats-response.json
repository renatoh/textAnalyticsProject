The photograph, which emerged on Tuesday night, showed \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez, 26, and his 23-month-old daughter Valeria laying facedown near Matamoros, Mexico, on the bank of the river that marks the US border \u2013 reopening a fierce debate about the scale of the crisis. The picture, by journalist Julia Le Duc, has drawn comparisons to the 2015 image of three-year-old Syrian boy Alan Kurdi, who drowned off Kos in Greece \u2013 sparking a significant moment in the European debate over migrants and refugees. Beto O\u2019Rourke said: \u201cTrump is responsible for these deaths.\u201d Writing on Twitter, the former Texas congressman added: \u201cAs his administration refuses to follow our laws \u2013 preventing refugees from presenting themselves for asylum at our ports of entry \u2013 they cause families to cross between ports, ensuring greater suffering &amp; death. At the expense of our humanity, not to the benefit of our safety.\u201d Fellow 2020 hopeful senator Kamala Harris condemned the picture as \u201ca stain on our moral conscience\u201d. She wrote: \u201cThese families seeking asylum are often fleeing extreme violence. And what happens when they arrive? Trump says, \u2018Go back to where you came from.\u2019 That is inhumane. Children are dying.\u201d Corey Booker, New Jersey senator and 2020 candidate, also blamed the president. \u201cWe should not look away. These are the consequences of Donald Trump\u2019s inhumane and immoral immigration policy. This is being done in our name,\u201d he tweeted. At a town hall in Miami on Tuesday night, Elizabeth Warren talked about her distressing experience visiting a detention centre in McCallen, Texas, last year, which she compared to a \u201cgiant Amazon warehouse\u201d full of cages full of people. Responding to a request by an audience member, she agreed to visit Homestead detention centre in Florida ahead of the first televised Democrat debate in Miami. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to Homestead tomorrow, come with me,\u201d she said, bringing audience members to their feet. To cheers she called for \u201cmore aid\u201d for central America and help to stabilize those countries and better treatment for those who cross the border into the US. \u201cTreat the people who come here with the dignity and kindness that marks the United States of America,\u201d she said. But frontrunners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders so far appear to have remained silent on the issue. Trump did not comment directly on the picture, but used the opportunity to criticize the Democrats over their border policies, making a series of untrue claims. \u201cToo bad the Dems in Congress won\u2019t do anything at all about Border Security,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThey want Open Borders, which means crime. But we are getting it done, including building the Wall! More people than ever before are coming because the USA Economy is so good, the best in history.\u201d He added in a second tweet: \u201cDemocrats want Open Borders, which equals violent crime, drugs and human trafficking. They also want very high taxes, like 90%. Republicans want what\u2019s good for America \u2013 the exact opposite!\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 June 2019 to correct the spelling of Alan Kurdi\u2019s name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
