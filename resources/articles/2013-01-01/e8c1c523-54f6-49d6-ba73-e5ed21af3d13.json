Lord Justice Leveson, Lord Hall of the BBC and Lord Hunt of the Press Complaints Commission are all native sons of Merseyside. Each knows the quickest, cheapest way to catch a ferry across the Mersey and the ups and downs at Anfield and Goodison Park. From William Gladstone to Cilla Black, Liverpool has never failed to produce successes, and the three lords a-debating grew up in a specially enterprising period of Mersey history. Hunt was in on the early years of the Liverpool poets. Leveson and Hunt were two years apart at Liverpool College during Beatlemania. All have brought lustre to their home patch and could bring yet more. Lord Heseltine's vision of a great region revived would benefit from these three backing devolution. And might the PCC's successor share the benefit of north-western origins? \u2022 This article was amended on 7 January 2013 because the original said Lord Hall went to Liverpool College. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
