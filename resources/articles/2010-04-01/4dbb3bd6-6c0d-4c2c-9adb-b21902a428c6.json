For instance, where I live in west London, the council has been determined to ram through a riverside development full of \"executive\" flats, in spite of the fact that most of the public hates it. Active citizens of the kind Cameron wants have been battling against it, and good luck to them. Mind you, I agree with them on this issue. It might be very different on others. What I would fear from the Tory plans is the Lynda Snellisation of Britain. Lynda Snell is the busybody on The Archers, who always knows what's best for the community, who wants to organise everything, and who treats anyone who disagrees with a terminal disdain. People try to stop her in her tracks, but it's hard, because Lynda is unflinching in her certainty. It's the bourgeois equivalent of what the old lefties used to call the \"democracy of the committed\", which meant that decisions were all taken by people who could be bothered to turn up and stay to the end of the meeting. They're the folk who pretty well wrecked the Labour party in the late 70s and early 80s \u2013 revolutionary Lynda Snells in dungarees and Che Guevara T-shirts. In the end, we'll all get weary. As Gary Gibbon of Channel 4 put it to Cameron this week, most people will want to watch TV or be in the garden. Meanwhile, Lynda Snell and Dave Spart will be beavering away on our behalf, without our support, relentless in their efforts. \u2022 I think Vince Cable's description of the public debt as \"the elephant in the room\" ultimately derives from an old and well-loved joke. A census taker calls round to someone's house, and after listing the people asks if they have any pets. \"Yes, a dog, two cats, a goldfish and an elephant.\" \"An elephant?\" asks the astonished official. \"Where does it sleep?\" \"Where it bloody well likes, of course.\" I may be wrong. But I'm right in saying that Vince was mistaken. The other parties (or \"the old parties\" as Nick Clegg calls them, as if the Liberals weren't far older than Labour) have banged on about the debt at immense length. What they've done is exactly what the Lib Dems have done, which is imply that it can be solved by \"cutting waste\" or \"reform of the system\", without any real pain for anyone. It's irrational, twisted logic, which reminds me of another old joke involving animals. A chap is travelling on a train. Every few minutes he tears up bits of paper and throws them out of the carriage window (I said it was an old joke). Another passenger asks why. \"To keep the lions away,\" he says. \"But there are no lions in Britain!\" \"Works really well, doesn't it?\" No more a mad fantasy than most of the economic nostrums we've heard. \u2022 Reader Dan Atkinson has sent me a photocopy of pages 44 and 45 of a novel published in 1971, by Don DeLillo. It proves that grisly round robin letters were around in enough quantity then for writers to be satirising them. The one DeLillo invented could have been written last Christmas. It includes all the now-familiar boasting about the triumphs of the year, the famous people encountered, and the bizarre mixture of trivia and bad news. The family lives in Florida: \"We had a hurricane in September with many killed. Then it was time for Vaughn to go into first grade. Our little 'scholar' combed his hair and put on a brand new suit for the occasion! However, just last week Bob had to rush him to hospital for surgery to correct some kind of congenital problem. I hope we'll have good news on this subject next year.\" I suspect this is the earliest fictional round robin, but I'd be happy to hear of any others. \u2022 A colleague recently spent ages collecting for Marie Curie cancer care, the wonderful organisation that provides round-the-clock nursing for patients who are on the brink of death. She distributed those plastic tub things to pubs and clubs, and this week went to pick up the contents. Folk had been generous, and the nine venues had raised more than \u00a3460 between them. What saddened her was that this is not even enough to provide one day's care, which the Marie Curie people say costs \u00a320 an hour. Even generous people who put in a pound coin provided just three minutes of help. Not a reason to stop giving, but depressing all the same. \u2022 There were bizarre cards available in the Manchester hotel where I stayed. At the bottom it said: \"Single lobster, \u00a33.25, pair of lobsters, \u00a36.20.\" I thought this was amazingly cheap, except it turned out this wasn't the price for eating the things, but adopting them. \"Adopt a baby lobster, and it will be released into UK waters \u2026 you will receive a certificate of adoption from the National Lobster Hatchery. Fill in your details, choosing names for all the lobsters you are adopting.\" Choosing names? What next? Will you go down to Padstow to see how they are getting on? Are the lobsters expected to send you cards, thanking you for your help and saying how pleased they are to be living in the sea off Thurso, signed: \"Your grateful adoptees, Lobby and Lobelia\"? Adopting a panda or a white rhino I can understand. But adopting a lobster in the hopes of creating yet more edible crustaceans just seems weird. Why not adopt a scallop, or foster a flounder? \"You can turn the life of a whitebait around.\" And don't we have enough to worry about in our lives without spending time thinking of names for lobsters?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
