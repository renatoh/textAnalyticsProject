As Sinclair McKay says in this entertaining book, by the 1970s vampires were as familiar a part of British life as sliced white bread and Morecambe and Wise, and it was largely due to Hammer Film Productions. Hammer gave us a world all their own, a place with Home Counties woodland masquerading as Transylvania (it was Black Park near Slough), heavily cleavaged vampire women, lashings of fake blood with a strange milkshake texture, and the occasional bad sets, particularly in the later films, as if Dracula lived in a branch of the Angus Steak House. It's immediately recognisable, this land where 'the inns are full and boisterous only until someone mentions a certain word', and McKay does a tasty job of evoking it. We all remember the red lining of Dracula's cape, but what a pleasure to be reminded of Peter Cushing's eyeball, suddenly seen huge through a magnifying glass as he examines the brain. Nostalgic stuff, but it was thought to be frightening in its day. In a Fifties publicity stunt, a Baltimore cinema challenged a young woman to watch The Curse of Frankenstein alone in the auditorium, to test whether she could endure its mind-sapping terror. Today it has a '12' certificate. More than scary, Hammer films were thought to be nasty, and here there was more truth in the charge. Early reviewers pulled no punches: these films were 'a sickening and nauseating way to make a living' - degrading, debasing and repulsive. Observer critic CA Lejeune wrote that she was 'inclined to apologise to all decent Americans for sending them such sickening bad taste'. Part of the trouble was the contrast with Hollywood productions of the Thirties and Forties. Horror films from Universal Studios were more ethereal and dreamlike and the monsters were overcome by the redemptive power of love. The Hammer world, in contrast, was more brutal and amoral, not to mention cheaper, with rubber bats from Woolworths wobbling about on the end of wires. The low production values must have contributed to the stigma Hammer had in the British film industry, so that actors might say they were just going down to Bray (where the studios were) for a few days rather than mention the H-word. Rank Films, too, were very different. J Arthur disliked working-class vulgarity, and his firm rejected one screenplay because they said 'it appealed to the stalls and the Rank organisation caters to the dress circle'. Hammer made no bones about appealing head-on to the stalls. McKay mentions an old photo of a Hammer cinema queue made up of mean-looking young men in pork-pie hats, and things were hardly any better as Hammer slid into its final decadence in the Seventies, watched by 'loon-panted, tank-top-sporting Herberts out for a laugh on Saturday night'. McKay rightly notes that Hammer films were in some way spiritually related to Carry On films (as he puts it, they were two studios that 'kept churning out monstrously vulgar films for working-class people, but did so with humour and panache'). Hammer films became so familiar that they earned their own Carry On send-up in Carry on Screaming (1966), and Hammer themselves made a number of dismal comedies, notably On the Buses. Now almost unwatchable, it was the year's highest grossing film in 1971. Late Hammers such as Dracula AD 1972 now seem like a cultural high point amid the malaise of the times. Beauty pageants topped the TV ratings, there was 'the ubiquitous crackle of purple and brown synthetic fibres', and the food was awful too ('Who remembers that restaurant chain the Golden Egg?'). All this was accompanied by an epidemic of 'permissiveness', and Hammer-style horror itself had become a genre of soft porn: the increasing availability of harder stuff is sometimes blamed for Hammer's demise, although the real reasons are probably more complex. If yesterday's audience was tank-topped Herberts, today it's an art-house crowd, characterised by McKay as 'earnest beard strokers' having their pre-movie drink 'in the subsidised bar'. There have been several serious studies of Hammer, and it has to be said that this isn't one of them. It's a critical romp. Where a critic such as David Pirie can superbly encapsulate the work of Hammer director Terence Fisher as a matter of 'bourgeois splendour versus decay and death', McKay's slapdash and jokey commentary is more often along the lines of: 'It sounds execrable but in fact it isn't. That's not to say it is good either... It's a classic of something, although it is difficult to say quite what.' That was The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires, while on Dracula Has Risen From the Grave McKay opines: 'Sorry, Christopher Lee, but it's true. That film is the drunk person's Citizen Kane.' Still, if this book has a touch of the potboiler then it's not inappropriate to its subject. Most Hammer films began as a title and a mocked-up poster, and it was only then that they cobbled together a film to go behind them. A Thing of Unspeakable Horror is fun to read, and it certainly makes you want to see the films again. You can hardly go wrong with Hammer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
