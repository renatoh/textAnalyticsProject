And yet who can resist the allure of the listicle? This December offers even more than usual, because it marks the end of a decade. Surveying the Australian film landscape as I whittled down my selections, the first thing that leapt out were the number of productions that emerged from first-time film-makers: seven in total. Just as strikingly, all except two of these deeply impressive works were helmed by directors who either wrote or co-wrote the script. The question of authorship in the collaborative medium of motion pictures has existed since virtually the beginning of the art form. There is no doubt, however, in the films listed below, from whose visions they emanated. These films are bold, unique, dramatic, funny and, at times, shockingly good, presenting thrillingly varied depictions of Australian life. 10. Terror Nullius (2018) and Spear (2015) Terror Nullius director: Soda_Jerk Spear director: Stephen Page It isn\u2019t easy to whittle a decade of national cinema down to 10 highlights, so please forgive the tie. Terror Nullius and Spear are very different films, though both have something striking in common: they are powerful challenges to the male-dominated, Judeo-Christian centric view of Australian history and identity, representing more diverse stories and broader cultural significance. The former \u2013 from the two-person art collective Soda_Jerk \u2013 is a work of remix and reassembly, plucking bits of pre-existing materials from a wide range of Australian films and TV in order to create new, incendiary political statements. Lord Humungus from Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, for example, now has Pauline Hanson as one of his gang. The film-makers describe their fiercely contemporary approach as a form of \u201crogue historiography\u201d; read this more detailed review to get your head around it. The director Stephen Page\u2019s Spear feels, to me, not just an individual film but a celebration of one of the most exciting movements in the history of Australian cinema: the first mainstream wave of Indigenous films from Indigenous film-makers, which only emerged, in full glory, at the turn of the century. Adapted from work developed by Sydney\u2019s Bangarra Dance Theatre, Spear \u2013 the first contemporary Indigenous dance movie \u2013 is a unique, atmospheric experience, matching beautiful choreography with striking visuals and an exquisite soundscape.

Animal Kingdom (2010) Director: David Mich\u00f4d The writer/director David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s Scorsesian gangland drama \u2013 inspired by real-life events involving Melbourne\u2019s infamous Pettingill family \u2013 won an Academy Award nomination for Jacki Weaver. As the crime family matriarch Smurf, the veteran actor hissed snake-like charm into lines that might have sounded ordinary coming from somebody else \u2013 such as: \u201cYou\u2019ve done some bad things, haven\u2019t you sweetie?\u201d And Mendo. Oh, Mendo! Plonk this guy on a couch, in front of a TV playing a music video for Air Supply\u2019s I\u2019m All Out of Love and hey presto: suddenly you get an unforgettably creepy scene. When it arrived in cinemas, Mich\u00f4d\u2019s film became an instant classic. Read more: David Mich\u00f4d on Animal Kingdom: I feared I was making a gigantic mess 8. The Infinite Man (2014) Director: Hugh Sullivan The writer/director Hugh Sullivan\u2019s joyously entertaining and fiendishly clever comedy follows a sad sack scientist (Josh McConville) who deals with a broken heart by inventing a time machine (as you do) in order to attempt to recreate the perfect weekend away with his girlfriend (Hannah Marshall). Things do not go to plan, especially when her ex (Alex Dimitriades) rocks up. This under-appreciated gem of a film, partly inspired by the nano-budget American indie Primer, is a chamber piece as zany as they come, with fastidiously arranged story architecture. Beneath the plot double-backs and parallel timelines, there is a meaningful message about how we cannot control the emotions of the people we love. Read more: The Infinite Man review \u2013 playful sci-fi with masterful plot manoeuvres 7. Acute Misfortune (2018) Director: Thomas M Wright The author, journalist and publisher Erik Jensen\u2019s book about Archibald prize-winning artist Adam Cullen is the sort of highly ambitious read that tends to be described as \u201cunfilmable\u201d. The debut director Thomas M Wright (who co-adapted the script with Jensen) turned it into a biopic for the ages, led by a mesmerisingly gloomy performance from Daniel Henshall, playing Cullen during his final, alcohol-soaked and heroin-filled years. Conflicted by the task of separating the myth from the man, Wright shirks the \u201ctortured artist\u201d trope and explores \u2013 like the great 2000 character study Chopper \u2013 big ideas about the nature of Australian culture and celebrity. Read more: Acute Misfortune review \u2013 Adam Cullen biopic is an enthralling, complex triumph 6. Snowtown (2011) Director: Justin Kurzel Nobody evokes a sense of festering dread quite like the great auteur Justin Kurzel, who kicked off his cinematic career with this icky drama about South Australia\u2019s infamous \u201cbodies in the barrels\u201d murders. Take a bow, again, Daniel Henshall, who was ghoulishly effective and compulsively watchable as the serial killer John Bunting. Threaded into a story of violence and abuse in decaying suburbia is an exploration of how the residue of traumatic experiences leaves an imprint on people\u2019s lives. The residue of this film left a hell of an imprint, too: it sits alongside The Boys, Chopper and Animal Kingdom as one of the great modern Australian crime pics. Read more: Snowtown rewatched \u2013 a supremely unsettling portrait of a killer 5. Sweet Country (2017) Director: Warwick Thornton The director Warwick Thornton\u2019s second masterpiece \u2013 after 2009\u2019s brilliant Samson and Delilah \u2013 is a neo-western of painterly beauty and biblical scope. Set in central Australia during the 1920s, Thornton\u2019s cross-country morality play follows an Aboriginal man (Hamilton Morris) who kills a bigoted war veteran (Ewen Leslie) and is chased across unforgiving landscape by a doggedly determined, hard-bitten cop (Bryan Brown). Thornton, who is his own cinematographer, conjures both achingly personal and grandiose compositions, with notes of a John Ford western. On a purely visual level Sweet Country ranks among the all-time greatest depictions of the Australian outback \u2013 up there with classics including Walkabout and Wake in Fright. Read more: Sweet Country review \u2013 brutal Australian western soars with Biblical starkness 4. Casting JonBenet (2017) Director: Kitty Green The director Kitty Green\u2019s enthralling film \u2013 beautifully shot by fellow Aussie Michael Latham, whose recent work includes Strange Colours \u2013 may investigate an American crime story \u2013 but it received development and production support from Screen Australia, which qualifies it for this list. How do you make a documentary about a murder case when nobody knows who did it? Green audaciously explores the (still unsolved) 1996 murder of six-year-old beauty pageant star JonBenet Ramsey by filming actors\u2019 audition for various roles, for a movie that was never intended to exist. She then uses those audition tapes \u2013 plus short re-enactment scenes and other embellishments \u2013 to present a meta, self-reflexive quasi-documentary that explores the relationship between truth, legend and performance. The resulting mind-melting film is twisted, complex and ingenious. Read more: Casting JonBen\u00e9t review \u2013 magnificent provocation to the very notion of truth 3. Hail (2011) Director: Amiel Courtin-Wilson Pretentious. Maddening. Inaccessible. I assume all these words have been hurled at the writer/director Amiel Courtin-Wilson\u2019s fiercely unique character study, which follows an ex-con struggling to adjust to life outside prison. He is played with bulgy-eyed intensity by the magnetic Daniel P Jones, whose life inspired the film. Hail combines hallucinogenic moments (one of which involves a dead horse being dropped from a helicopter) with bone-rattling verisimilitude, creating an unusual dance between realism and fantasy; perception and delusion. The uncompromising Courtin-Wilson is one of those most interesting Australian film-makers to have emerged since the turn of the century. 2. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) Director: George Miller Returning to his signature franchise to again capture a world gone to hell in a petroleum-doused handbag, director George Miller\u2019s desert-set explode-a-palooza is the most decorated Australian film in history \u2013 winning six Oscars, and accruing an Immortan Joe-sized bounty of accolades. The AV Club voted Fury Road the best film of the decade, local critics called it the finest Australian film so far in the 21st century, and this week Miller confirmed there is a follow-up in the works. The plot is simple: an on-the-road story about the world\u2019s greatest U-turn, which sees Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) meet his match with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). Not a scene nor a moment is squandered in this intensely visceral beast of a film; you don\u2019t so much watch it as experience it.

The Babadook (2014) Director: Jennifer Kent The writer/director Jennifer Kent\u2019s shockingly brilliant feature debut is another hard-wired genre pic synonymous with dropped jaws and countless accolades. The \u2018dook\u2019s many champions include The Exorcist director William Friedkin, who (not inaccurately) described it as one of the scariest films ever made. Essie Davis delivers a gooseflesh-raising tour-de-force performance as a single mother experiencing a \u2013 shall we say \u2013 turbulent period in her life, thanks to a creepy character from a children\u2019s book that leaps into existence and terrorises herself and her son (Noah Wiseman). Kent\u2019s film is brilliant work of atmospherics that evokes deep, dark and terrifying emotions; it is ultimately about the fear of being a bad parent.
