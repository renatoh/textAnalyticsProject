With all the snow and reindeer tropes, it can feel like Australians are already one step removed from the traditional idea of Christmas, but being incarcerated with nothing but your own jealous imagination and violent inmates \u2013 well, it\u2019s a lonely time and Paul tells it well. White Wine in the Sun \u2013 Tim Minchin \u201cI really like Christmas,\u201d opens this shamelessly sentimental ode to how \u2013 despite the commercial drive of the silly season, and how oddly a religious holiday is placed in our secular society \u2013 sometimes you need to just shut up and be excited by what Christmas actually means: how family reigns supreme, how everyone is happier and more forgiving, and how Christmas is just \u2026 nice. Sometimes nice is exactly what you need. Season\u2019s Greetings \u2013 Stella Donnelly Or on the other hand: a different but equally accurate distillation of the push and pull and push again of the family Christmas lunch, with the differing opinions and political leanings all rubbing up against each other \u2013 with liquor to loosen the mood and add to the messy emotion of it all. Everyone is sweaty, everyone is stuffed, everyone is day-drunk and letting their anger out. Bit of a language warning on this one, which you\u2019ll find at the end of the Spotify playlist as a result \u2026 Merry Christmas! Spend Christmas Day with Me \u2013 Darren Hanlon Is there a more romantic notion in the entire world than humbly, hopefully asking someone to spend Christmas day with you? Island Christmas \u2013 Christine Anu \u201cThe colours of an island Christmas are as colourful as me and you.\u201d This charming Christmas carol by one of our country\u2019s finest singers flatly rejects the usual snow and eggnog for a reality check. No breeze, no snow \u2013 just singing, dancing and dreaming. Plus, she sings the words \u201cfair dinkum\u201d, which I don\u2019t believe anyone else has ever done successfully. Home and Broken Hearted \u2013 Cold Chisel Nothing can illuminate a broken heart quite like a holiday season when love, goodwill, companionship and good vibes are wrapped into the package. Don Walker\u2019s lonely lyrics and Barnesy\u2019s grizzled delivery nail this sentiment perfectly. Santa Never Made It to Darwin \u2013 Bill and Boyd More a bleak history lesson than the usual tidings of Christmas joy, this classic is nevertheless woven into Australian holiday lore due to its message of resilience in the face of devastation. Although it is specifically about the havoc Cyclone Tracy brought to Darwin in 1974, it doesn\u2019t take a leap of logic to find the parallels with the current bushfire disasters that loom over this Christmas. Christmas Day \u2013 The Tin Lids Easily the cutest Christmas single to ever chart in Australia, this song has charmingly off-key vocals, stars four of Barnesy\u2019s kids, breaks into a massive half-time emo-esque chorus and is from an album that sold 100,000 copies. A job well done. Christmas Photo \u2013 John Williamson Cricket, ham, goannas, cake and beer. This song nails both the delicate dance of conversing with extended family and the impossible task of taking a definitive Christmas photo that everyone will be happy with. Boxing Day Blues \u2013 Courtney Barnett A classic Christmas comedown, when you realise that if your lover isn\u2019t into you any more, the whole season is useless. Like a Christmas tree on Boxing Day, you have a full year until you are relevant again. Another short and spiky one from Barnett. \u2022 Got your own Australian Christmas classic?
