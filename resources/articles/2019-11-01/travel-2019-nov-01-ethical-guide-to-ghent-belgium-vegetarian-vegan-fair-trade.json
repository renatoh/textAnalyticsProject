To keep prices low, Arno de Mol, the cafe\u2019s owner, ditched costly vegan staples like avocados in favour of doing creative things with local produce such as celeriac, and served the dishes on mismatched crockery from charity shops. Eventually, however, living for his principles took its toll, and with the support of a commercial partner, de Mol increased his prices \u2013 although he was disappointed to see that even a \u20ac2 rise has made it harder to reach people on lower incomes. De Mol typifies the local, grassroots economy that is expanding in Belgium\u2019s third-largest city. Ghent has long been known for its student population and left-wing politics, but increasingly it is developing a reputation for socially conscious, eco-friendly food and shopping. Part of this is down to the town\u2019s youthful demographic. \u201cYoung people are more conscious of the fact that the earth and its resources aren\u2019t as endless as people thought 20 years ago,\u201d says de Mol. He also credits the support of the city council, which has just appointed him to advise on a new online platform, Vanier (van hier means \u201cfrom here\u201d in Flemish), which encourages restaurants and businesses to buy from local farmers and producers. Lokaal is just one of a number of quality plant-based, socially conscious restaurants in Ghent. Others include vegan cafe Barbiet, all-you-can eat vegan joint Konkommertijd, Cafe de Walrus, a stylised rendering of the traditional Belgian bruin caf\u00e9, and Lekker GEC, a veggie cooperative. At organic food market Beo Versmarkt, customers can sip natural wine as they peruse locally sourced groceries. All aim to foster a gezellig vibe (the Dutch answer to hygge). De Mol\u2019s aim is for Lokaal to feel like \u201cour living room\u201d \u2013 and lots of the enterprises are involved in social projects, such as a scheme enabling customers to purchase items for donation to the homeless. Just Hazel Feelgoodstore (Burgstraat 14) is a new boutique selling fairly made clothes and jewellery. Owners Siel Vandamme, Fien Drieghe and Nina Spooren haven\u2019t been able to quit their day jobs yet, but when I meet them at the shop on a Saturday evening, they tell me, over glasses of Roomer, a delicate local elderflower liqueur, that it\u2019s important boutiques like theirs exist, even if it requires a few sacrifices. \u201cOur parents raised us to think about food and clothes and where they come from,\u201d says Vandamme. \u201cWe wanted to sell clothes like in H&amp;M but fairly and locally made.\u201d Other shops flying the ethical fashion flag in the city include Mieke and A.puur.a, purveyor of independent sustainable designs; and local gender-neutral lingerie designer La Fille d\u2019O, which champions body positivity by using customers of all shapes and sizes as Instagram models. Just Hazel itself specialises in carefully curated European fair fashion brands in affordable, youthful styles. The stock reflects the city\u2019s laid-back sense of style: trend-led but not as high-end or polished as neighbouring city and fashion capital Antwerp. Like people across Flanders, Ghentians are bike-mad. The streets are stuffed with parked bicycles \u2013 often left unlocked. The airy Bidon Coffee &amp; Bicycle is arguably the epicentre of the city\u2019s cycling culture, but there\u2019s also Tuub, a quality bike shop with an environmental message, and Plum, a celebrated Flanders institution. The city is home to 44,000 students, and their influence can be seen in the city\u2019s laid-back nightlife, which usually involves new and unsigned bands playing in casual cafe venues. Eric Smout runs popular music promoter Democrazy. Over a high-strength Belgian craft ale in the recently opened Bar Mirwaar, a moodily lit cafe which regularly hosts funk, soul and jazz jam sessions, he tells me that Ghent is a breeding ground for new music talent in Belgium. \u201cGhent has an artistic feel,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have a lot of artists and bands here, lots of free concerts \u2013 and you can hop around and see what\u2019s happening.\u201d This is in part thanks to the local music schools, as well as a proliferation of relaxed cafe venues such as Trefpunt and Charlatan, outdoor pop-up Dok, and larger spaces such as former socialist party headquarters-turned art centre Vooruit (whose beautiful, high-ceilinged bar serves an array of craft beers). Outdoor concerts showcasing new talent are a key feature of Gentse Feesten, an annual week-long summer festival (17-26 July 2020). Ghentians joke that babies born nine months later in April are the festival\u2019s children. One influential venue is Zebrastraat, an unusual development that combines private housing with an eclectic contemporary arts programme. Its new bar, Xyz Lounge, has won plaudits for its dramatic design by Parisian \u201cstarchitect\u201d Didier Faustino, which features \u201cgender neutral pink\u201d walls with embedded Sonos speakers. Xyz Lounge also hosts regular of events \u2013 including outdoor concerts next to a manmade beach in summer, and inside a cosy forest cabin in winter. In unpretentious Ghentian style, it also puts on a weekly bridge club for the elderly. Democrazy is also working on opening a venue of its own to respond to the city\u2019s voracious appetite for live music \u2013 from indie rock to techno or contemporary jazz. New bars are popping up all the time, according to Smout. I ask him why there have been so many recent openings and he raises a glass of Bar Mirwaar\u2019s home brew: \u201cThe combination of beer and music \u2013 it\u2019s very good.\u201d Looking for a holiday with a difference?
