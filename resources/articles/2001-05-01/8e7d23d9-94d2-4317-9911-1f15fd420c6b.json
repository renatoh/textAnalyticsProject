Francis, who this season took the club to the Worthington Cup final against Liverpool and a third successive qualification for the First Division play-offs, has a year of his current contract to run. The board had indicated before the Worthington Cup final in February that his contract would be reviewed at the end of the season. However, when he met the club's co-owners David Sullivan and David Gold for their end-of-season meeting on Wednesday he was not offered an extension to the deal he signed two years ago. The refusal follows a renewed insistence by Sullivan that Premiership football is a priority at St Andrews. \"We must achieve Premier League status in order to maintain the kind of growth we have experienced over the past five years,\" Sullivan said. \"It is true that it is getting harder each year to make ends meet as we strive for the Premiership, adding to player wages at an alarming rate each season. \"If we wanted to be a middle-of-the-table First Division club we could probably increase short-term profits, generate cash and even pay dividends each year; but this is not our goal.\" Sullivan's words followed the announcement of City's \u00a31.16m pre-tax profit in the latest interim results, figures boosted by earnings from their Worthington Cup run. Hamburg have completed the signing of Jorg Albertz from Rangers. The clubs had appeared deadlocked over the fee for the German midfielder but finally agreed on \u00a33m, a club record buy by Hamburg. Albertz has signed a three-year contract with the Bundesliga club after five years at Ibrox. He had joined Rangers from Hamburg for \u00a34m and was a member of three championship-winning sides. Albertz was named Scotland's player of the month yesterday, but for much of the season his first-team opportunities have been limited. Wales are likely to be without the Leicester midfielder Robbie Savage for next month's World Cup double-header with Poland and Ukraine. He is not due back from a holiday in Florida until the weekend, when Mark Hughes's squad will gather for the fixture with Poland at the Millennium stadium a week tomorrow and Ukraine in Kiev four days later. Leicester maintain that Savage needs several weeks of rest after a knee operation towards the end of the season, despite the fact that he played in five of the midlands club's last six matches, including their final league game at Leeds. However, Savage has not been training fully in recent weeks and may ask Hughes if he can join the squad to play in the two internationals but be excused serious training. The Wales manager is unlikely to agree to that arrangement. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
