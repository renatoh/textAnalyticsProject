If you\u2019re trying to decide what level of cover is right for you, here are a few things to keep in mind. If your car is registered, you already have compulsory third party insurance (also known as CTP, or green slip insurance). It covers you against compensation claims if you hurt someone in an accident. But CTP will not cover you for loss or damage to your car, or someone else\u2019s. Before you hit the road, you may want to consider additional insurance to cover any property damage caused by an accident. If you take out third party property damage insurance this will protect you financially if you damage someone else\u2019s car and are asked to foot the bill. Third party property, fire and theft provides the same cover as third party property damage, with extra protection against loss or damage to your vehicle due to fire and theft. But if you\u2019re looking to insure your own car against more of life\u2019s perils, you need what\u2019s called comprehensive car insurance. What does it actually cover you for, and why is it worth considering? Here are its five key benefits: 1. It covers you for loss or damage to your vehicle The biggest difference between third party insurance and comprehensive insurance is how your own car is covered. Third party insurance covers you for damage to other people\u2019s vehicles, should you become involved in an accident and are deemed at fault. Comprehensive insurance not only covers you for damage to other people\u2019s vehicles - but covers your own car as well. If your vehicle is stolen or damaged in an accident, even if you\u2019re at fault, comprehensive cover has your back. It\u2019s a good idea to think about how you\u2019d fare if you suddenly found yourself without a car. Would you be able to get to work without it? Would you be able to afford to buy a new car straight away? If either answer is no, comprehensive cover might be a better fit for you. 2. You can tailor your cover If your car is involved in an accident, you may not be able to drive it while it\u2019s being repaired or replaced. But your comprehensive insurance provider may be able to cover the cost of car rental to keep you moving in the interim. Some insurers will cover the cost of car hire for up to 14 days if your car is stolen, and indefinitely if you\u2019re involved in a no-fault accident. Comprehensive insurance can also cover the cost of emergency transport and accommodation, if required. Again, the decision here comes down to how you could manage day-to-day life if you had to go without a car. If you live somewhere without reliable public transport, for instance, that car hire could be a lifesaver. 3. You can get new-for-old replacement If you bought a brand new car within the past couple of years, some insurers offer new-for-old replacement if your car is a write-off. Some insurers will even take care of the registration and CTP on your new car if you meet certain criteria. This can make comprehensive cover a smart option for those who have bought a new car recently. 4. You\u2019re covered for fire, theft, storm damage and floods Another benefit of comprehensive cover is that it doesn\u2019t only cover you for road accidents. It also insures your car against a range of other situations, including theft, fire, flood and storm damage (think: hailstones through the windshield). If your car is caught in severe weather, you won\u2019t have to stress about it. 5. All the little things We\u2019ve summarised the big benefits of comprehensive cover. But it can help with a lot of smaller things too. Your insurer may provide a guarantee on authorised repairs, for example, and may cover you for some or all of these, up to certain limits: - If your car needs to be towed following an accident. - If your keys or remote are stolen. - Theft or damage to personal effects in your car. These are things you might not normally think about, but it can be great cover to have if something does go wrong. And to make things feel more rewarding, taking out insurance also means you can access benefits such as earning Qantas Points simply by paying your premiums. Find out more about Qantas Car Insurance.
