Why is it hitting the NBA? What's Macaulay Culkin got to do with it?", "bodyText": "First, why is it suddenly a big deal that Drake is at an NBA game? It is not, in and of itself, significant that Drake was at an NBA game. He is, after all, the most passionate adherent of the great North American celebrity past-time of performatively watching basketball. In fact, he\u2019s become a sort of quasi-mascot for his beloved Toronto Raptors and has been extremely present throughout their journey in this year\u2019s NBA playoffs. He paces the sideline, trash talks opposing players, celebrates annoyingly and sometimes rubs the Raptors coach\u2019s neck. Other teams do not like it. When the Raptors played the Milwaukee Bucks earlier in the playoffs, the city\u2019s newspaper published an article headlined: \u201cMilwaukee totally hates Drake, who doesn\u2019t own the Raptors but is somehow allowed to freely roam the court.\u201d It\u2019s just that the stakes are higher right now. The Raptors are in the finals against the Golden State Warriors and it\u2019s really the ultimate test of the Drake curse. Sorry, what? Drake is cursed? Yeah, I mean I don\u2019t believe in curses but Drake is obviously cursed. What\u2019s the Drake curse? It\u2019s simple: if Drake wears a jersey, poses for a photo with an athlete or in any way appears to be supporting any particular team or person, that team or person will go on to lose, often against the odds. After Drake posed for a photo with Layvin Kurzawa from the French football giant Paris Saint-Germain, they lost their next match 5-1. It was their worst defeat in nearly two decades. The UFC fighter Connor McGregor lost his fight to Khabib Nurmagomedov after he took a photo with Drake. The Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero met Drake and then missed a penalty in a Champions League game. Seriously, the list goes on and on. The latest victim was Anthony Joshua, the (now former) heavyweight champion boxer. Going into his last fight Joshua was the overwhelming favourite. His opponent, Andy Ruiz Jr, was an 11-1 underdog, and Joshua was an undefeated superstar. So confident was Joshua that before the fight he tweeted a photo of himself with Drake along with the caption: \u201cBout to break the curse.\u201d He lost the one-sided fight in the seventh round after getting knocked down four times. Oof, that\u2019s rough. I\u2019m surprised Drake hasn\u2019t been banned from sporting events entirely. Yeah, well: Seems fair. Tell me about the hoodie. Why did he go to a game wearing a jumper saying \u201cKEVIN?!?!?!\u201d with a picture of a Home Alone-era Macaulay Culkin screaming on the back of it? I mean, apart from the fact he\u2019s used way too much punctuation, Home Alone is a film about a kid accidentally left behind from a family holiday while the house gets burgled. That\u2019s hardly good luck? You could read the jacket as Drake acknowledging the curse\u2019s power, and harnessing it for his own use. Kevin is a reference to Kevin Durant, the Golden State Warriors star who has missed the first two games of the NBA finals. It\u2019s also, obviously, Culkin, who played Kevin McCallister in Home Alone. Maybe Drake is trying to direct the curse\u2019s power towards the Warriors. There is precedent for this. Drake was seen wearing a pair of Philadelphia 76ers shorts when the Raptors were playing them during the NBA\u2019s eastern conference semifinals. It\u2019s more likely, though, that Drake is just being a troll. Why is it all over the internet though? In a glorious moment of serendipity, Culkin was actually at the same game as Drake, sitting a few rows behind him and his hoodie. Culkin snapped a pic and uploaded it to Twitter, where it went viral: Drake made a joke about Culkin, who then made an even funnier joke. The internet loves jokes. Especially when they get meta. That\u2019s wild. It\u2019s pretty wild. I don\u2019t get the barbecue reference though. Who is hosting a barbecue? How do I get an invite? In the first game of the series Drake trolled the Warriors by wearing the jersey of Steph Curry\u2019s father, who played for Toronto. He then got into what appeared to be a heated exchange with a Warriors\u2019 player, Draymond Green, after the game. It seemed like maybe they really didn\u2019t like each other!? But then it came out that after the game that they both met up at a fancy Toronto restaurant and are actually pals. So even though Culkin is trolling Drake trolling the Warriors, they are all still friends in the end. Aww. So did Drake\u2019s team lose the game? Not only did they lose the game but afterwards Durant was filmed giving Drake a hard time. \u201cSee you in the Bay, Aubrey,\u201d he said. \u201cYou weren\u2019t talking tonight, were you?\u201d Drake appears to respond, \u201cIt\u2019s 1-1\u201d \u2013 a reference to the seven-game series now being level. It really will be the ultimate test of the Drake curse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
