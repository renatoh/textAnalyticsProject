Their director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, gave a strong hint that, with the RFU disciplinary panel accepting that Clark had not intended to break the arm of Leicester's hooker Rob Hawkins in the LV Cup final a fortnight ago, and the remorse Clark had shown, Northampton were likely to throw their weight behind an appeal. Mallinder seemed less certain about contesting the eight-week ban on the England hooker and club captain, Dylan Hartley, for biting during the Six Nations. \"We'll support him as we will with Dylan,\" said Mallinder when asked about a possible appeal by Clark. Without it, the 22-year-old will be out of the game until November, not only ending any chance of making England's summer tour to South Africa but probably the four autumn Tests as well. \"What you have there is two very competitive players, outstanding rugby players, and you can't take away that competitive edge and sometimes, whether it's through frustration, people sometimes go over the top,\" said Mallinder. \"With Calum, the disciplinary panel found what Calum said from the outset and that there was no intent to injure. If you couple that with Calum's remorse, genuine remorse, it's a shame and to us that 32 weeks seems harsh.\" Mallinder was speaking after Northampton had all but ended Bath's chances of making the Heineken Cup next season, while reclaiming their final play-off spot, jumping over Exeter whose win over London Irish three hours earlier had seen the Chiefs temporarily move into fourth place. Northampton visit Exeter after hosting Leicester in a fortnight and the likelihood is that the semi-final line-up will be decided before their final regular season game against Worcester. Hartley would be available if they make the final and Saturday's performance \u2013 a mixture of good Northampton, dire Bath \u2013 would suggest Mallinder's team have rediscovered the form to get to Twickenham. Bath, bar a brief period early in the second half, were not at the races and it will be interesting to see what their ambitious and wealthy owner, Bruce Craig, does now that his friend Andy Robinson has decided to stay with Scotland. Uncertainty surrounds the role of Sir Ian McGeechan, Bath's director of rugby, but one of his deputies, Martin Haag, dismissed suggestions that the club was suffering from the swirl of suggestions that a new head coach was heading for the Rec. \"We didn't play very well today, in fact we were awful,\" said Haag, who had just seen his forwards concede a penalty try before being bullied back over their own line. \"It's nothing to do with anyone else outside the changing room. We have to put it right, to be mentally tough and strong to come through this,\" he said. \"Playing at home you expect more than we gave out there today so we owe everyone an apology.\" Bath Abendanon; Banahan, Hipkiss, Carraro (Vesty, 59), Biggs; Donald, Claassens (McMillan, 65); Flatman (Catt, 52), Dixon (Batty, 60), D Wilson (Bell, 65), Attwood, Caldwell, Skirving (Mercer, 28), Fearns, Taylor (Ovens, 65).
