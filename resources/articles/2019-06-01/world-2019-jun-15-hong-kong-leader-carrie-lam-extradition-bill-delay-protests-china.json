Lam\u2019s announcement represented perhaps the most serious government climbdown in the face of public pressure since a security law was dropped in 2003, an important democratic moment for a city where people are free to demonstrate but not able to choose their leaders. However, opponents warned they saw it more as a tactical retreat than an admission of defeat, aimed at buying time to intimidate or demoralise opponents. There have already been reports of arrests in hospitals, as people sought treatment, and of digital activists. \u201cYou can say it was a partial victory, in the sense she has halted this bill at this moment,\u201d said the opposition lawmaker Charles Mok. \u201cWe are not celebrating. Many of us were still not satisfied that she hasn\u2019t withdrawn it completely, and the way she talked about police [brutality].\u201d He joined other activists and critics in urging residents to take to the streets again on Sunday to keep up pressure on the government and chief executive. Lam has proved a lightening rod for protesters, with many demanding her resignation. In a combative press conference after three days of silence, Lam repeatedly described herself as \u201cheartbroken\u201d, and admitted that the bill had \u201ccaused a lot of division\u201d in Hong Kong. But she insisted her only errors were of communication, defended the law as vital to security and promised to relaunch an improved version after further consultation. She also played down the size of demonstrations and repeatedly claimed police use of force was defensive. Earlier in the week she added fuel to public anger when she doubled down on support for the law and criticised protesters who had endured a day of teargas, rubber bullets and police beatings as \u201cspoiled children\u201d. Her abrupt reversal \u2013 reportedly made after meeting with one of China\u2019s most powerful leaders on Friday \u2013 was apparently aimed at warding off further chaos on Sunday, although Lam denied she was trying to appease the crowds. \u201cThe decision I made is not about pacifying people or, as some have said, restoring my damaged reputation,\u201d Lam told journalists, claiming she acted to stop violence escalating. \u201cThis is time to restore as quickly as possible calmness in society.\u201d The rise in tensions was almost entirely self-inflicted, after Lam tried to ram the hugely unpopular bill through the legislature before it broke up for the summer, leaving minimal time for consultation or debate despite its sweeping implications for everyone from dissidents to entrepreneurs. If the extradition bill becomes law, it would allow both residents and visitors to be sent to China for trial in opaque courts controlled by the Communist party. Critics say that would destroy the judicial \u201cfirewall\u201d that protects Hong Kong, and fatally undermine its economy and way of life. Some Hong Kong tycoons have already started moving assets abroad amid concern about the extradition law, Reuters has reported, citing financial advisers, bankers and lawyers. Lam\u2019s hurry was ostensibly aimed at bringing to justice a man who brutally murdered his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan, but authorities there worried it could affect their sovereignty and so said they would not use it. In response, hundreds of thousands of protesters thronged Hong Kong\u2019s streets to oppose it at the weekend and prevent legislators reaching parliament Wednesday to vote it through. The scale of the protests prompted intense international scrutiny, with the US presidential hopeful Joe Biden the latest figure to weigh in on the showdown, praising protesters\u2019 bravery and warning officials that the \u201cworld is watching\u201d. Lam and officials in Beijing now appear to have calculated that the political cost of temporary retreat and caving to public pressure would be less than that of further confrontation. Lam met one of China\u2019s most senior politicians, Han Zheng, in the Chinese border city of Shenzhen on Friday night to discuss the situation, the pro-Beijing Sing Tao reported. Zheng is the central government\u2019s point man on Hong Kong, a vice-premier and one of just seven members of the elite politburo standing committee. The legislature is due to go on summer recess in July, and Lam said it would not be possible for lawmakers to examine the bill within this year; it is possible it will not be reopened for even longer. \u201cIt looks unlikely they would dare to resume the controversy in the near future, not within this year,\u201d said Claudia Mo, another opposition lawmaker, although she feared the bill would return. \u201cA suspension is essentially a postponement. They are just delaying the pain.\u201d Others were more hopeful that, particularly if public pressure continues, the government might back away permanently as it did after mass protests about a new security law in 2003. \u201cThere is some historical precedent here. Article 23 that was supposed to regulate national security was also indefinitely shelved, and it hasn\u2019t come back since,\u201d said Lokman Tsui, Assistant Professor at the School of Journalism and Communication of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cSo if you look at that, it might mean that it won\u2019t come back. But at the same time, I think people are right to insist on more forceful language including the actual retraction of [the law].\u201d Organisers of Sunday\u2019s march said it was going ahead and called on Hong Kong residents to turn out again in large numbers, to protest police violence and a round-up of many demonstrators, as well as the law itself. \u201cWe saw so many innocent citizens subject to police force,\u201d said Sham Tsz kit, convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, which is helping organise the demonstration. \u201cOur anger is unprecedented, we call on people to protest tomorrow, we need to tell people we are guarding Hong Kong,\u201d The group has also set up a trust to support arrested and injured protestors. A small crowd of protesters already gathered near government headquarters on Saturday said they had no faith in Lam\u2019s promises of greater consultation, and were bracing for a long fight. \u201cIt\u2019s a temporary measure to cool our anger. I don\u2019t believe them,\u201d said 63 year-old Alexandra Wong. \u201cEven if they don\u2019t properly launch this again, they are only going to use more shameful, hidden ways to sneak the agenda back in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
