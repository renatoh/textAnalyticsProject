Dobraje refused to confirm reports that Leeds United had made a late bid for the player over the weekend. The Newcastle wing-back Olivier Bernard signed a new three-year contract at St James' Park yesterday, less than a week after trying to leave the club to join West Ham. Newcastle alleged that West Ham had made an approach during last season and complained to the Premier League but the Frenchman, 22, insisted that he was out of contract. Newcastle claimed his contract still had a year to run. West Ham denied any illegal approach. An arbitrator appointed by the Premier League ruled in United's favour last month. \"Newcastle United will tell Bernard 'no hard feelings, just report for training with the rest of the squad next week',\" a club statement said at the time. Bernard appealed against the ruling, only to make his surprise u-turn yesterday. The Nigeria defender Taribo West could be set to return to the Premiership with Bolton. \"Taribo is a quality player with a great deal of experience. He is a player that I would like to have in my squad,\" said the Bolton manager Sam Allardyce, who recently signed West's Nigerian team-mate Jay Jay Okocha. Meanwhile the Bolton midfielder Paul Warhurst has signed a new one-year contract with the club. Sunderland's manager Peter Reid has signed the Tranmere midfielder Sean Thornton. The highly rated 19-year-old, who is out of contract at Prenton Park, will join Sunderland for pre-season training this week but the clubs have yet to agree compensation despite months of talks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
