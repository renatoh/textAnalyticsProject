The Scottish forward had been pencilled in to return after flu in last night's reserve fixture with Aston Villa but was absent from Bellefield yesterday and overlooked for the match. The fall-out is likely to herald the end of Ferguson's turbulent second spell at Goodison Park and possibly the forward's career. Moyes has run out of patience with a player who has managed only 28 Premiership starts since rejoining Everton from Newcastle for \u00a33.75m three years ago. Injury and disciplinary problems have nullified the 31-year-old's impact even though Ferguson's tally of four goals in eight appearances this season might suggest he was still capable of making an impact. The last of those games was against Charlton in the Carling Cup last month after which the Scot retired to his sick bed. Everton will struggle to shift him from the wage bill since the striker has 18 months to run on his \u00a334,000-a-week contract. Manager and player have clashed in the past but the latest incident could not have come at a worse time. Everton approach Saturday's visit of Wolverhampton Wanderers enduring their worst spell under Moyes and languishing in the relegation zone after failing to win any of their last five league games. The Wolves defender Paul Butler has been charged with misconduct by the FA over incidents which followed the club's 2-0 defeat at Middlesbrough earlier this month. Butler is alleged to have used \"aggressive behaviour constituting improper conduct\" after the referee Steve Dunn and other match officials submitted their reports to the FA. Wolves' captain Paul Ince has also been asked to explain his post-match comments regarding Danny Mills and the refereeing of the game. Mills's actions during the game prompted an angry response from Wolves' players, notably when he initially disputed the award of a free-kick after a clash with Lee Naylor. The free-kick had been awarded to Boro and some Wolves players were still involved with Mills when Gaizka Mendieta scored the first goal. The Wolves midfielder Alex Rae was sent off towards the end of a bad-tempered match at the Riverside and the visitors' manager Dave Jones subsequently confirmed there had been an incident in the players' tunnel after the game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
