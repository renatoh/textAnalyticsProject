Uefa confirmed yesterday that disciplinary action will be taken against Celtic for failure to control their supporters after one fan ran on the field and gave Dida's face a slap just after the hosts' last-minute winning goal. While no charge has been issued against Milan's Brazilian goalkeeper, Uefa has asked the Champions League winners for an explanation as to why Dida was substituted. The goalkeeper was guilty of elaborate play-acting after starting to chase the fan before collapsing to the ground and being taken from the field on a stretcher. Uefa saw no legislative cause to charge Dida or Milan but it seems likely that, if the Italians' explanation does not meet with the disciplinary body's approval, some form of punishment could be issued. Responding to claims from the Celtic chairman Brian Quinn on Thursday that Dida's \"antics have to be taken into account\", Adriano Galliani, Milan's vice- president, said: \"Regarding the case of Dida, Milan has made no formal complaint but we must not allow the situation to be inverted so that it looks like this is Milan and Dida's fault. That seems unjust to me. Fans should not enter the field of play and strike people violently. Milan's way of behaving is determined by the club and the club therefore will not make a formal complaint. We have more class than that. This case is not about Dida.\" A heavy fine remains the most likely sanction, with an outside chance that all or part of Parkhead could be closed for future European matches. The case will be discussed by Uefa's control and disciplinary body on Thursday. The Celtic manager, Gordon Strachan, has insisted the inquiry will not detract from a famous maiden victory over the Italian giants. The fan, Robert McHendry, of Cambuslang, admitted a breach of the peace at Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday. He will be sentenced next month after reports."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
