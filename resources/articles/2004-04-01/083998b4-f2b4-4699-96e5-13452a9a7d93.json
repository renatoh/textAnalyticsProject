I am an idiot'", "bodyText": "'Big Ron' Atkinson has made a name for himself with his clever catchphrases and colourful cliches. In one moment of madness last week, though, he showed a side of his personality that was neither big nor clever when, speaking into a microphone he did not think was on, he referred to Chelsea defender Marcel Desailly as 'what is known in some schools as a fucking lazy, thick nigger'. The next day Atkinson's world collapsed around him. He resigned from his job at ITV. He had to give up his column in the Guardian. And he lost a fortune - as much as \u00a31 million - when other commercial projects were ditched by the companies he was associated with. To be fair, a phrase he often uses himself, Atkinson has been big enough to face what he did head-on. Instead of hiding, he held up his hands. During the week he gave a television interview to explain what had happened and apologised. Yesterday, Atkinson opened the doors of his home in Worcestershire to sit down and talk about the worst week of his footballing life. He agreed to an interview with me because I edit the New Nation, the biggest-selling newspaper in Britain's black community, and asked for forgiveness from those whom he most offended. He wanted to 'put it all into perspective'. I arrived at Atkinson's mock Tudor house at 9am. The gates opened on to a drive where a Mercedes saloon and a Jeep were parked. Atkinson greeted me with a grin and a firm handshake. 'Hello Mike, you'll get in trouble coming round here, ya know.' After being ushered into his living room, we spent the next two hours talking frankly about what he said, why he said it, whether or not he can be classified as a racist, and football in general. In reply to my opening line - 'It's been a tough week' - Atkinson said: 'I think I'd have been better off shooting somebody. 'I tell you what's been great, though. I've had tremendous support. Late last night, and I don't know the guy, G\u00e9rard Houllier [the Liverpool manager] rang me up. So has Sir Alex [Ferguson], Bobby [Robson], Terry Venables, Pleaty [David Pleat of Tottenham]. Loads of 'em.' When one of the boys is in trouble, the football community certainly rallies round and Atkinson singles out a call from former Liverpool player John Barnes as a particular favourite. 'Barnsey said, \"Ron, you're not a racist, coz if I wanted a job and you were in a position to give it to me you'd give it me. People who are racists are the ones who look at you and go [because you're black] you're not getting the job\". He said: \"You've always proved who you are with your actions\".' I ask Atkinson to take me back to last Tuesday when, after commentating on Chelsea's 3-1 Champions League defeat against Monaco, he was heard to utter those fateful words. 'I've got to the end of the game and I am so angry. There's a commercial break from what I can remember and I'm just talking to myself. And to be fair I've been critical of several of the players. 'And then your man comes up [Big Ron can't bring himself to say Desailly's name]. My job is to analyse and I've criticised him in the match. Then I've come out with this infamous line, which to this day I don't remember saying. And it must have gone into the lip mike which has gone down to Dubai [the offending words were broadcast in the Gulf, but not in Britain]. I didn't know anything about it till the next day.' He goes on to say that Andy Townsend, a fellow match summariser, was first to tell him that 'something's gone out on air and it's come out in the Middle East'. Then he rang a friend in Dubai who told him exactly what he'd said. As Atkinson is talking, the doorbell rings. Maggie, his wife, comes in to let her husband know that someone called of Paul has dropped by. Paul is black. Embarrassed, Atkinson insists this is not stage-managed, saying 'he's never been to my house before'. Paul is a local businessman and friend who pops in just long enough to say: 'Speak to you later, keep your chin up.' After a while his mobile phone rings. 'Whereabouts?' says Big Ron. 'Gleneagles, Loch Lomond?' It's Jim Smith, the Portsmouth director of football, on the line, trying to organise a golfing escape in Scotland for the coming week. Eventually Atkinson tells his old friend: 'I don't think I'm going to be able to make it, after all that's gone on.' Has there been a difference in the reaction from people who have nothing to do with football? He pauses before saying: 'I dunno. But there was a poll on the telly last night, and 82 per cent were in favour, not of what I've said, but of giving me a second chance. 'I've offended nobody more than me at the moment. Christ almighty it's cost me roughly a million quid. I've done my penance.' An expensive mistake, to be sure, but what about the cost to his reputation - and why on earth was he so wound up about Chelsea losing? 'If it had been Man U, I would have been worse.' Pause for thought. 'Well, I wouldn't ... It's just that you want English teams in the final. We all do.' So why hadn't he just shut up? Where had the racist language come from? Surely he realises only a racist would have such a word in their vocabulary? He concedes: 'What I said is racist, I understand that, but I'm not a racist. Don't forget, I was brought up ... look I've had pairs of shoes that have been nigger brown, that's what they used to say. Does that mean anything to you? 'Now I realise more than ever the implications of it but it never meant...' He trails off, but my impression is that he was about to add the words 'anything serious'. The reason so many people were shocked is partly because of his track record as a manager. In the late Seventies, as manager of West Bromwich Albion, he brought through three black players, Cyrille Regis, Brendan Batson and Laurie Cunningham, who are now regarded as pioneers. For that reason alone in Britain's African Caribbean communities, Atkinson has had more respect than many other managers. What does he have to say to people who were, until last week, big admirers of Big Ron? At this point he seems close to tears. 'Look, all I can say is sorry, I genuinely did not mean to offend anybody. What else can I say? I'm an idiot, but I'm not a racist. A racist is someone who won't give a black man a chance. My actions over the years prove that I have no problem with that. Not to my knowledge. I'm hoping that people look at the broader picture and see all the good I've done. I've never used that word before.' 'You know what, if somebody had said what I said about Desailly to one of my players, I would have got 'em by the throat and chinned 'em.' Then Atkinson asks me: 'Look, I've seen a black guy with the word nigga, or something like that, on his number plate? What's that?' I explain that some young black people have, in an attempt to lessen the effectiveness of the word, used the term nigger, or nigga, as they spell it, as a term of endearment. I also tell him that most African Caribbeans see such people as misguided imbeciles. Some gay people call themselves queer, I say, it's the same principle. Atkinson looks confused. 'But we always used to call gays queer, didn't we, you mean you can't...' Once again he trails of, this time with incredulity. Then he offers an anecdote. 'I remember Brendan Batson, back in the Seventies after Arsenal got rid of him coz that wasn't their policy, had a chip on his shoulder, maybe rightly. But anyway, we were doing something in training and I dropped him and he said to me: \"Boss, you don't know my problems.\" He was talking about racism. I said if that's your problem you've got it for the rest of your life. Two months later he was club captain.' Of similar problems at West Bromwich, his advice to black players was: 'The way to overcome it [racism] is in the way you conduct yourself plus the way you play.' He tells me another tale about a black footballer. This time it's former West Bromwich, Sheffield Wednesday and England midfielder Carlton Palmer. 'CP rings me, he says, \"Gaffer, I've cracked it. I've played for England. I'm sitting here in my garden with a couple of cans of lager. And I've got a white gardener doing my lawn.\" Is that offensive? It isn't to me.' We go go outside in the sunshine to take some photographs in his huge and impressive garden. The lawns are as big as Wembley. Atkinson emphasises again how he feels and says: 'Listen, when all this happened it was the worst day of my life in football. I really want to make it clear to the black community that I'm genuinely very sorry. I've apologised - I don't know what else I can do.' Turning the tables, he decides to put me on the spot: 'So, tell me, do you think I'm a racist?' He listens intently to my reply: 'I don't think you are a racist, but I do think you have a racist element in you and I don't think you are aware of what racism is. 'No, you don't see colour when you are giving a person a job, and that's how it's meant to be, but you come from an era when certain things were acceptable and I think you are not quite aware of what those things are. That's when you can become racist. I think that in the instant that you used the term nigger you were a racist. 'I don't think that had Desailly been white you would have mentioned his colour. You might have called him a lazy bastard, but you certainly wouldn't have called him a lazy, white nigger.' He doesn't contradict me. I expect we'll see him back in the TV studios before long."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
