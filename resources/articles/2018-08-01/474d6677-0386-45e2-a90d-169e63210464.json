The Italian described the Spaniard as a \u201ccomplete player\u201d after a run of four goals in six appearances for the club, before going on to say something that was meant warmly but that in its own curious way damned the forward. \u201cYou\u2019d be open to have this type of person marry your daughter. A good guy, a polite person.\u201d Few men want to be described as polite daughter-marrying material and certainly not someone trying to establish themselves in the cut-throat environment of the Premier League. The compliment was particularly unwelcome for Morata given that he had been tasked with replacing Diego Costa, that most alpha-male of centre-forwards: ruthless, rugged and absolutely not the type of man a father would want to see with his little girl. More than anything, Costa was a deadly goalscorer for Chelsea and that is something Morata has failed to be since arriving from Real Madrid for a club-record \u00a358m fee in July 2017. He started well before tailing off, scoring 12 times in 42 games between September and May, and the sense going into a new campaign with a new man in charge was that his time in west London was coming to an end. Instead, however, Morata has started all three of Maurizio Sarri\u2019s games in charge and got his first goal of the season during Saturday\u2019s thrilling 3-2 victory over Arsenal. It was a fine finish, too, the 25-year-old showing clever movement, good strength and calmness under pressure to give the hosts a 2-0 lead after 20 minutes. Afterwards Morata insisted he had never contemplated leaving Chelsea in the summer and believes that, if anything, the change of manager will help him establish himself as the main man at Stamford Bridge. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s easy. I could have gone back to Spain or Italy, all the people believe in me there, but I want to change things here,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to, not for all the haters, but for me and for Chelsea. Chelsea gave me everything that I needed and now I have time to give back all that Chelsea give me. \u201cThe most important thing is the way we play. Last season it was direct balls and for me to protect the ball in the air is not my best quality. Now I can attack the space, I can play one touch and go in the area for the crosses. It\u2019s better for me.\u201d Morata is enthused by the success Sarri had with the likes of Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Dries Mertens and Lorenzo Insigne at Napoli and feels confident that under the 59\u2011year\u2011old\u2019s guidance he too can become a consistently potent centre-forward. \u201cHe [Sarri] works with the ball always and when you always have the ball the strikers have more chances,\u201d Morata said. \u201cI want to score more than 30 goals, but I would prefer to score 15 or 20 and get the Premier League or one big trophy.\u201d Morata also seems keen to lay down roots, having regularly been on the move during a career that has also taken in a spell at Juventus. He spoke of \u201clooking forward to buying a house\u201d and how he can\u2019t wait for his \u201cbabies to grow up and to put them in school\u201d. That kind of talk hardly helps Morata shed his polite guy image but, equally, it reflects a level of determination on the part of the Spain forward. He is here to stay and we had all better get used to it. Morata will hope \u2013 even expect \u2013 to start again when Chelsea travel to Newcastle on Saturday in search of a third successive league win. They will almost certainly achieve that should they perform with the cleverness and skill in attack that did for Arsenal but, equally, they could come unstuck should they display the naivety in defence that allowed Unai Emery\u2019s side to get back into the contest before half-time. \u201cWe did very well for 75 minutes of the 90. Inside there were 15 horrible minutes,\u201d Sarri said. \u201cWe lost distances, we were not able to press. We were really in trouble.\u201d Sarri will no doubt work on Chelsea\u2019s defensive deficiencies in training this week and he also took the opportunity to announce another, more personal attempt at improvement. \u201cI am going to stop smoking,\u201d he said. \u201cJust for one or two years, then I will start again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
