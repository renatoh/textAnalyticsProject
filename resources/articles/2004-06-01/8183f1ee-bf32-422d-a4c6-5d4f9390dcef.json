The second session is almost upon us, and England will be looking to clean up the tail end. If, like me, that's left you with an image of a man with a plastic bag on his hand and a snappy little dog, I can only apologise. 119th over: New Zealand 376-7 - McCullum 21, Franklin 2: I'll come clean and admit I have no idea what the boy Smyth was banging on about this morning. Too busy with, erm, other stuff. If anyone cares to sum it up in one short sentence, I'd be mildly grateful. WICKET! JUST! McCullum (21), caught Hoggard, bowled Harmison: New Zealand 382-8 As he often likes to do, McCullum tries to knock it beyond point. Michael Vaughan had clearly expected it and stuck Hoggard on the boundary where, having first juggled it like the Great Soprendo, he finally takes the catch. Kyle Mills is the new man in for his Test debut. Against Harmison. He survives the remaining three balls unscathed. ANOTHER ONE! Mills (0), caught Jones, bowled Hoggard: New Zealand 382-8 Four balls, four minutes, and Kyle Mills walks off to the sound of quacking on his Test debut. Clearly edged to Jones, there are question marks over whether it went to ground before being caught. Chris Martin is the new one in, and thank Christ it's not that one. Oh, and that was Hoggard's 100th Test wicket, which he'll be pleased about. AND ANOTHER ONE! Martin (2), caught Vaughan, bowled Hoggard: New Zealand 384 all out And that's very much that, with the skipper taking a straightforward catch at gully, albeit at the fourth attempt - they must have been at the butter in the England dressing room. Advantage very much England's. THE INBETWEEN BIT \"Smyth talked about really annoying people from real life,\" says Matthew Gibson. \"A good example would be people who turn up for work without having done the relevant preparation.\" Erm, [cough nervously]. Eh? Ah. Right. THE INBETWEEN BIT I might as well come clean, however. I failed to prepare for the cricket because I was helping out in a local soup kitchen. It's not much, I know, but it helps. Happy now, Gibson? Eh? 1st over: England 1-0, Trescothick 0, Strauss 0 One no ball. That's. Your. Lot. Sorry. Actually, no I'm not. It's not my fault. WICKET! Strauss (0) b Cairns, c McCullum, England 1-1 The ball darts away off the seam, little nick, and McCullum's gloves are of the non-grease variety. Great start for England, and Butcher's the new man in. 3rd over: England 1-1 I'm being called a liar! \"You've not been working in a soup kitchen, you liar,\" growls an aggressive Mark Bermingham, unaware that not only do I do much fine work for charity but I also know Kwan-Tae-Kwang, a rare form of martial arts. \"For one, Harper, you are a hack, not well know for their altruism. And anyway, it's too hot for soup.\" It was a hand-made gazpacho, I'll have you know. Oh, and by the way, Chris Martin hobbles off having tweaked a muscle. Someone else is bowling, I'm not sure who, for I'm too busy reeling. And I was in such a good mood. 4th over: England 1-1 This is what I'd term a cagey start from England. The word turgid also springs to mind. Still, long way to go etc. 6th over: England 6-1 Oh dear me, as a four from Butcher raced away to the boundary and bounced up into the crowd, it landed on some old chap's saggy chops. 5th over: England 6-1 A veritable flurry of runs there, the meat coming from Trescothick, working Franklin away to deep mid wicket. The temperature is-a rising. WICKET! Butcher (5), b Franklin, c England 18-2 Pitched up and invited Butcher to drive it - straight to Styris at slip. Moments earlier, a four from Butcher had bounced up and hit some old duffer in his saggy chops, waking the poor boy up. Shouldn't laugh, only it was funny. 8th over: England 24-2 Vaughan's in, obviously, and running recklessly for a quick single. Is desperation creeping in already? 9th over: England 28-2 Safety first from Vaughan this time, who prefers to pump Franklin to the mid wicket fence for four. \"Is the football going to get the minute-by-minute treatment over the next three weeks?\" asks Andrew Goldsby. Although you could be forgiven for thinking I've just made his name up so as to shamelessly plug the fact that we'll be covering every single kick of Euro 2004. In fact it's probably best I come clean and admit I wasn't really down the soup kitchen today, I was actually tweaking and polishing bits and bobs ahead of the big kick off. I've never made soup in my life. 11th over: England 35-2 Franklin to Vaughan, pitched up outside the off stump, and driven down the track to the long off boundary with the contempt it deserves. 12th over: England 41-2 Vaughan's timing is making our man Smyth drool on the other side of the desk. He's just plundered another four, tickling Mills past the diving square leg fielder. Vaughan, not Smyth. He's eating a Scotch egg. 13th over: England 52-2 Trescothick, who's been quiet so far, cuts Franklin away to the third man boundary for four, then steals three more to deep square leg. \"So apart from your benevolence etc, what is the topic for this afternoon?\" asks Alex Hearn, and while it's a valid point, I'm glossing over it by pasting a poser from Steve Warr. \"I saw a white van this morning which had no-less than seven England flags arrayed over its roof,\" he crows, sounding surprisingly proud. \"Can anyone out there else beat that level of heartfelt National Pride?\" He means cartoon xenophobia. 14th over: England 57-2 They're bludgeoning poor Mills all over the shop: this time Trescothick hammers him for four past the point fielder. \"What do you mean 'great start to England' after they lost Strauss in the 2nd over?\" asks Chris Stroud. \"Surely you mean New Zealand.\" Sorry Chris, I thought you'd be able to sense the sarcasm, clearly I over estimated. It won't happen again, and thanks for clearing things up for our other brain-dead readers. 16th over: England 58-2 \"Great commentary Nick,\" says Michael Hamilton, \"perhaps it's time to ask your boss for a rise?\" Perhaps worth pointing out for the benefit of Chris Stroud, he's being sarcastic. 17th over: England 62-2 Easy pickings for Trescothick, glancing Oram away to fine leg for four. They're... hang on... erm... 322 behind. 18th over: England 72-2 This Vaughan-Trescothick partnership has nibbled away at the New Zealand lead, with 50 just 66 balls. You missed two more fours from Vaughan, again off poor Kyle Mills. He's having a tough time on his debut. Meanwhile, apologies to all those nags complaining that I've missed a few overs. I'm blaming the computer. Again. But honestly, it's true. Would I lie to you? 20th over: England 81-2 First ball of the Mills over, Vaughan flicks him away to mid wicket for four more. It was a shocking line, and Chris Cairns is having a word, probably an F-word, I wouldn't wonder. 21st over: England 81-2, Trescothick 37, Vaughan 39 The individual scores at the top are for Tom Evans, who asked nicely. 23rd over: England 99-2, Trescothick 37, Vaughan 39 There's bad news and good. The bad is that the computer is having three-minute breathers between every over, so I can't keep you up to speed. The good, however, is that Vaughan escaped a dodgy Lbw, and that my time is nearly over. Georgina Turner has a competent computer, so you may have more joy in the third session. It's tea! Bringing an appropriately shambolic end to a hapless session on my part, I was just off to make a cup of tea when I realised I hadn't finished the session. Apologies, and England finished on 99-2, Trescothick on 45 and Vaughan 44. Ahem, sorry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
