On the 18th he hit his drive miles to the right. We get to the ball and it's in the trees, about 15 feet away from a 10ft-high wall surrounding a swimming pool. \"I've got a shot,\" he says. I tell him: \"Come on, I know you're Seve Ballesteros but you're not Paul Daniels.\" He told me to go away and then hit this shot out of the trees, through a one-foot gap, up and over the wall, across the swimming pool. It landed about two yards short of the green. The guy is an absolute legend. Geoff Ogilvy, 2006 US Open winner and world No8 Seve didn't create golf in Europe but you might not have a Jos\u00e9 or a Sergio if not for him. He was special. I played him once. He was past his peak but was so much fun to watch. He still hit a couple of shots where you just went, \"Oh, come on, you can't do that.\" Seve showed that you can grow up with a stick for a club and play on the beach and make it. Paul Broadhurst, former European Ryder Cup player I was there when he won the Open in 1979, in the grandstand behind the 18th green at Lytham as a 13- or 14-year-old. He was my hero. I'll always think of the Ryder Cup and how much it meant to him, how much he wanted to win for Europe. You have to respect his decision to retire and look back on a great career. Thomas Bjorn, twice a member of winning European Ryder Cup teams Legend: that is the only word to describe him. He has done more for the game on this side of the Atlantic than anyone and has made the Ryder Cup what it is. His character has been missed in the last few years - you don't so much know if you were in the same room as Seve as in the same town. To play with him when he played well was the most intimidating thing you could do. His holing of the putt at St Andrews to win the Open in 1984 is the thing that stands out for me, the defining moment of his career. John Daly, 1991 US-PGA Championship winner, 1995 Open winner He is the greatest short-game player I have ever seen. Playing with him was more fun than watching, because you could see it in real life. You could never count Seve out - I often thought his strongest point was when he missed the green. He is a very nice guy, who has always been nice to me. Every time I've played with him, his iron game and short game has been perfect - it just seemed like his driving let him down. I hope he changes his mind, because we would love to have him on the Champions Tour. It is strange not seeing him, Jack Nicklaus and Greg Norman - the greatest names in golf - at majors anymore."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
