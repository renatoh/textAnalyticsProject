The second-largest company in America by market capitalisation, seen as an economic barometer, saw its shares fall by nearly 13% after it reported a 6% decline in profits. GE also lowered its earnings forecast for the year. While the company blamed the profit fall on a slump mainly on its financial services businesses, analysts said the figures confirmed the dire state of the US economy and that the turmoil in credit markets has begun to spread from banking to the industrial sector. The FTSE 100 was badly hit by the news, slumping 69.6 points to finish at 5895.5 points, while the Dow Jones industrial average slipped more than 200 points on the news. \"These results confirm that the slowdown is widespread and beginning to impact capex [capital expenditure] and longer-cycle businesses,\" said Stephen Surpless, of Cantor Fitzgerald in London. \"While the credit crisis might be nearer to the end than the beginning, according to some, the impact on the real economy is taking place and is unlikely to abate in 2008.\" Reporting a 20% fall in profits at the company's commercial finance unit, GE chairman and chief executive officer Jeff Immelt maintained that the company was in good shape despite a decline in profits at the industrial unit, which makes lighting and appliances. \"Demand for our global infrastructure business remained strong, but our financial services businesses were challenged by a slowing US economy and difficult capital markets. While we are disappointed with our results, the fundamentals of our businesses are strong. \"We knew the first quarter was going to be challenging, but the extraordinary disruption in the capital markets in March affected our ability to complete asset sales and resulted in higher mark-to-market losses and impairment.\" The weaker than expected results from GE, which also owns entertainment group NBC Universal, come as finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading economies and central bankers prepare to meet to discuss the turbulent global economy. Other analysts warned of more bad news to come as the US corporate reporting season gathers pace. \"One of the themes we'll hear this earnings season is how bad within financials it was in the last few weeks. That's what GE highlighted,\" said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of US equity group at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management in New York. \"And the weakening US economy is another theme we'll hear.\" There are growing fears that difficulties being experienced by US companies will soon cross the Atlantic and affect British industry. A spokesman for the EEF, the engineering and manufacturing employers' organisation, said the fall-out from the credit crunch had yet to strike the British manufacturing sector. \"It would be incredibly naive to think there would not be a knock-on effect at some point, but prospects remain reasonably healthy for the rest of the year, there are no signs of distress,\" he said. In mainland Europe, some corporate leaders have already shown signs of succumbing to the credit crisis. Last month Siemens, Europe's biggest technology group, saw its shares plunge after it issued a shock profits warning that its earnings could be almost wiped out in the current quarter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
