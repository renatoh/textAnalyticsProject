Owned by David Carter, an interior designer with an international reputation, this four-storey Queen Anne townhouse is tucked away unnoticed on the busy Mile End Road. Beautiful enough to look at from the outside, the real joy starts as soon as you open the front door. A panelled hallway leads to rooms decked out with such exquisite taste and filled with so many beautiful objets d'art you'll feel like you're in one of the countless glamorous photoshoots that have taken place there. Take a camera and prepare to be dazzled. \u2022 109 Mile End Road E1, + 44 (0)20-7790 0259, 40winks.org, doubles from \u00a395 The Garden B&amp;B Slip out into the eponymous garden here and you're in for a surprise, for this is a prize-winning labour of love that has found its way into glossy magazines and on to television programmes worldwide. Split into four separate areas to suit all horticultural tastes, guests can take breakfast among the blooms on sunny mornings. The decor of the house itself, a Victorian villa tucked away in a quiet conservation area, reflects the owners' extensive experiences abroad. The two top-floor rooms \u2013 a double and a twin \u2013 are spacious and airy but you'll still have to suppress the urge to grab a duvet and sleep out in the garden. \u2022 Killieser Avenue SW2, +44 (0)20-8671 4196, thegardenbedandbreakfast.com, doubles \u00a398 Arlington Ave There are two bedrooms in this gorgeously appointed Georgian townhouse in the quiet backstreets of Islington. Stay in either and the owners claim the only sound you'll hear is birdsong \u2013 not bad for a des res just a short hop from the centre of town. The interiors \u2013 a happy blending of ancient and modern styles \u2013 reflect the unimpeachable taste of the owners. Clutter is out but comfy homeliness is definitely in. The trendy caf\u00e9s and independent shops of Upper Street are a short stroll away, and there's a small but abundant back garden to relax in once you're back. And no, the prices are not a misprint. \u2022 Arlington Avenue N1, + 44 (0)7711 265183, arlingtonavenue.co.uk, doubles from \u00a350, singles from \u00a340 6 Oakfield Street Imagine the untrammelled leafy streets of Chelsea. Now imagine how untrammelled and leafy the streets of an area within that called Little Chelsea must look. That's Oakfield Street \u2013 it's no surprise to learn that Sir Thomas More's lush estate was just next door. Number 6 is a mid-Victorian terraced house close to the bistros and restaurants of Hollywood Road and a few minutes from both the King's Road and the trendy \"Beach\" district. Inside, check out the beautiful mural and the collection of Egyptian prints. There's also a roof terrace, perfect for taking in some rays or watching the stars come out at night. Oh, and a cat called Kippa. \u2022 6 Oakfield Street SW10, +44 (0)20-7352 2970, athomeinnchelsea.com, doubles \u00a390 The White House B&amp;B There's a reason why this B&amp;B is called The White House and it has nothing to do with a fondness for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Yep, if your style is icy cool or clean 'n' fresh, this is the place to be. The Fulham home of an interior designer, the rooms are sleek, elegant and modern with a plant or painting adding a splash of colour to each blank canvas. The Thames is a pleasant stroll through residential streets in one direction with Fulham Broadway tube in the other. Come the evening, there's a range of restaurants to choose from less than a minute away. \u2022 41 Rosaline Road SW6, +44 (0)20-7385 8005, whitehouselondonbandb.com, doubles \u00a390 (minimum stay three nights) 108 Streathbourne Road Balham, famously mocked as The Gateway to the South, is actually home to a surprising number of desirable tree-lined streets, Streathbourne Road being one of them. Number 108 is a marvellous red brick Victorian pile built in the days when homes aspired to be castles and very nearly achieved their dreams. Thankfully, inside there's not a hint of Victorian stuffiness or chintz. Rather the owners have gone for a comfortable home-from-home feel, an effect increased by the fact that you can dine here, too. And if you fancy getting out and about in the evening, Balham High Road \u2013 just around the corner \u2013 is a haven for trendy restaurants. \u2022 108 Streathbourne Road SW17, +44 (0)20-8767 6931, sawdays.co.uk, doubles from \u00a390 Number 42 We all know that this is definitely, absolutely and unquestionably the year that an Englishman (oh, all right, a Scot) will win Wimbledon. When he does, nearby Number 42 will make an excellent base for your celebrations. Built in the 1930s, the house is large enough to contain not only a double bedroom and a super king suite but a family room complete with its own balcony overlooking the garden. And what a garden. 160-foot long, it contains an \"African Savannah Hut'\", an air raid shelter (now a wine cellar), and backs on to Kendor Rose Gardens, so success won't be the only sweet thing in the air. \u2022 42 Daybrook Road SW19, +44 (0)20-8543 8709, bedandbreakfast-wimbledon.com, doubles from \u00a380 26 Hillgate Place Notting Hill may not be quite as airbrushed as the eponymous film made it look, but it's still a pretty chichi kinda place. And there's nowhere better to get you into a West Eight state of mind than this 1840s townhouse. One bedroom has a flawlessly tasteful Caribbean theme and a huge bathroom boasting a claw-foot cast iron bath and tiffany lighting. The other is furnished throughout with Indian antiques and textiles from all over the globe. There's a Dutch breakfast on offer in the morning, a roof terrace should you wish to work on your tan, and a bijou courtyard filled with shady palms if not. \u2022 26 Hillgate Place W8, +44 (0)20-7727 7717, 26hillgateplace.co.uk, doubles from \u00a380 52 Becmead Avenue The perfect hideaway for those inclined to pronounce Streatham as St Reatham. This large Edwardian house has bright high-ceilinged bedrooms with original tiled fireplaces and a hall inspired by William Morris' Arts and Crafts movement. Guests can enjoy breakfast around an oak farmhouse table or on the patio if the weather permits. There are bus services from the end of the road, should your horizons stretch beyond Streatham. The owners themselves are very well travelled, a fact reflected in the Italianate library and the exotic prints and maps that adorn the walls. And those who crave a dash of olde England can book the room with the four-poster bed. \u2022 52 Becmead Avenue SW16, +44 (0)7752 473861, 52becmeadavenue.co.uk, doubles from \u00a380 A Nice Little B&amp;B Not many people can claim to make strides in the world of post-modern nomenclature while also providing a funky place to get your head down. The owners of Blackheath's A Nice Little B&amp;B manage just that though. \"Your bedroom is lovely,\" they further proclaim. And they're right, assuming you love spacious rooms with a simple fresh modern look (laced with a soup\u00e7on of Habitat). A hearty breakfast taken in the courtyard garden of a sunny morning will set you up for a pleasantly idle mooch around the little independent shops of Blackheath Village or a ramble through Greenwich Park to take in the Observatory, naval museum and deer park. \u2022 1a Heathway SE3, +44 (0)7958 419510, nicelittlebandb.co.uk, doubles from \u00a375 \u2022 Dixe Wills is a travel writer for the Guardian, specialising in green and budget travel.
