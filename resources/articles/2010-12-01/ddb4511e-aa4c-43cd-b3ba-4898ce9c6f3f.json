A Harris poll for the Financial Times shows that the British public are more ready than most to make financial donations, but less happy about being asked to volunteer to deliver public services. The findings raise doubts about the prime minister's aims of boosting \"mutual responsibility\" by supporting a new culture of volunteering and encouraging people to take an active role in their communities. Next week a green paper will set out government proposals to increase the amount of time and money given by the public. Cameron has rejected the suggestion that his mission is a cover for spending cuts, pointing out his idea of a big society preceded the general election and the government's deficit reduction programme. The poll for the FT, conducted in the UK, France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the US, reveals that 77% of people in Britain surveyed said they had donated to charity in the past year \u2013 a far higher figure than their European counterparts and above the 71% figure cited in the US. But when asked whether they agreed that they should be \"encouraged to give up some of their time to help support public services\", the UK response lagged at the bottom, with just 25% endorsing this view. The US topped the chart, with 42% agreeing they had a role to play. The findings suggest Cameron has some way to go to persuade more Britons to roll up their sleeves and get involved. To date, volunteering levels have been fairly constant over the past few decades, according to the FT, with the level of involvement ranging from 20% to 40%, depending on whether participation is measured monthly or yearly. In the run-up to next week's green paper, the Cabinet Office pointed to a range of initiatives already on the cards, such as the National Citizens' Service for young people, which give them the opportunity to develop life skills and serve their communities, and funding for the training of 5,000 community organisers who are intended to push social action by neighbourhood groups on the ground. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: \"The government is committed to driving forward the big society: putting power and opportunities in people's hands. We want to see people coming together to solve problems and improve life for themselves and their communities. \"Social action and volunteering is a key part of this and so we have already introduced a number of initiatives to help people get involved.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
