Almost a million festival-goers bought tickets for Fringe events last year, but critics claim many of its shows have become overpriced and out of touch with the people of Edinburgh. They have launched the Edinburgh People's Festival, which will be held in half-a-dozen venues away from city centre hotspots, thereby keeping costs down and taking events to areas overlooked by the main festivals. Corporate sponsorship and tickets costing up to \u00a315 - for comedian Ross Noble's show - fly in the face of the original spirit of the Fringe, according to those behind the new festival, which will run from 10-16 August. It was now geared towards tourists and beyond the means of many within the city, they said. Colin Fox, who is organising the People's Festival, said it would give a platform for new performers in areas such as Wester Hailes, Portobello and Gilmerton. 'The same thing is happening to culture that happened to football,' he said. 'It is being taken over by brewers and multi-nationals and prices have shot up. 'The festivals make millions for the hotel chains and big pubs in the heart of town, but does little for the people who live in the parts of Edinburgh not being shown off to the rest of the world.' A one-night prototype People's Festival was held last year at the Jack Kane centre in the Craigmillar area. Its success encouraged Fox, who is also a Member of the Scottish Parliament, to organise a full week of events this year. Tickets costing just \u00a32 will sell for performances of theatre, music and art. Despite Fox's concerns, the Fringe, which runs from 3-25 August, goes from strength to strength. Advance booking at most of the main venues have outstripped the phenomenal success of last year, when 975,000 tickets were sold - up 12 per cent on 2001. Last year, a third of ticket-buyers were from outside the UK and the average Fringe-goer spent eight nights in the city. Director Paul Gudgin boasted that ticket sales had outstripped sales for events at last year's Commonwealth Games in Manchester. 'In the not-too-distant future, the Fringe could be selling a million tickets in a single year, a feat absolutely unparalleled for a cultural event,' he said. Fears had been voiced that the destruction by the fire in December of the Gilded Balloon, one of the three main Fringe venues, might discourage people considering travelling to Edinburgh. But alternative arrangements have been made for the Balloon to be based in the Edinburgh University student union building on Teviot Row, a venue it began using two years ago. It will also use The Venue nightclub on Calton Road, The Caves on Niddry Street South and Cabaret Voltaire, a nightspot on Blair Street, almost directly opposite the old burnt-out site. A Fringe spokesman said 2003 was shaping up as their biggest ever year and denied that the festival had become a vehicle for multi-national commerce. 'We welcome new arrivals to the Edinburgh festivals, but 2003 is shaping up as a great year for the Fringe. There has been some criticism over pricing, but we do not control what people charge. The Fringe is an umbrella organisation, but performers and venues decide what is charged. And people are paying the prices to see top shows,' he said. 'But people should remember that there is plenty to see and do for free in Edinburgh. Across the city, there will be fresh, young talent taking making its mark.' Fringe organisers point to emergence of new venues as proof that the city's most popular festival still has its cutting edge. In the past, the Gilded Balloon, the Pleasance and the Assembly Rooms have formed the cornerstones. But the December fire sparked a move to develop newer venues and there are 207 Fringe sites this year - 24 more than last. The most talked about of 2003 are the The Pod and Smirnoff Underbelly. The Pod is situated within a tent outside the Sheraton Hotel, while Underbelly on the Cowgate - close to the burnt-out Balloon. Seventy temporary venues have been created and as usual, some Fringe acts are opting for bizarre venues in a bid to grab the limelight. Theatre goers are being invited to pack into a public toilet, the back seat of a Ford Escort and a lift. Traverse Four @ Your Convenience uses toilets behind the St James Shopping Centre and the audience will spend one half in the gents and the other in the ladies. The play, which tells of an affair between an MP and a call girl in the 1950s, has been described as 'a smart, slick piece of work with a glamorous film-noir quality'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
