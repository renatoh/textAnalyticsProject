Admittedly, Ian Hislop, the editor, let out a despairing 'I take this as a personal insult' during the election campaign when he saw a casually jacketless Blair pose in front of a stained-glass window and lead hundreds of ecstatic schoolgirls into the hymn 'We are the Children of the Future', which the PM clearly was not. His understandable frustration at years of hard satirical work having no impact on the target was misplaced for all that. He could equally have taken the pious photo-opportunity as a backhanded compliment. Private Eye had got Blair's measure, even if Blair hadn't got the joke. By playing with the stock caricature of the trendy vicar, it could claim to have captured his faults. The vicar is a power-mad egotist; he speaks English as if he learned it in an evangelical summer camp in Finland; he is meretricious, priggish, bossy, vacuous, simpering, dogmatic, vainglorious, saccharine, platitudinous and phoney to the core. Every inch of the ground is covered except one. The trouble with the vicar parody is that the most militant atheists in Britain don't believe vicars are evil. The mild anti-clerical tradition doesn't go that far, even Richard Dawkins doesn't go that far. But you can't understand Blair unless you recognise the streaks of malevolence in his politics and cowardice in his character. Incitements to the evil of racism were heightened a few weeks ago when the Express came out as a true mirror of the filthy mind of its owner, Richard Desmond, a hard-core pornographer and new friend of our Christian Prime Minister. It joined the Sun and the Mail in saying the Third World men and women should stay where they are. Unforgivably, the paper didn't declare that Desmond has an interest in keeping women in slums: his websites promote group-sex fantasies about girls in Brazil and Bombay being bought for $5 apiece by gangs of tourists. Riots and murders can't deter Fleet Street from daily peddling the pretence that old England is being overrun. If there are stabbings now, when interest rates and unemployment are at their lowest for a generation, imagine if you can the violence when recession comes and anyone with a funny accent can be presented as a stealer of native jobs. While we wait for the crash to do its worst, hatred is spread by two methods. First, the credulous must be persuaded that asylum-seekers aren't genuine refugees but illegal immigrants. The rebuttal of this cheap lie has been rehearsed many times in these columns. The Government has made almost all asylum-seekers illegal immigrants by denying them visas to travel to Britain legally. Of those who are smuggled in, about half turn out to be genuine and are allowed to stay after they've been through the appeals system. I'm sorry to repeat myself, but the Prime Minister could have spared me the necessity of boring you. He might have changed a foul climate for blacks and Asians as well as asylum-seekers if he had the courage to speak the plain truth. He chose to remain silent. Second, asylum-seekers must be branded as aliens. Modern New Labour rejected the yellow stars of the twentieth century and marked refugees with the ghetto currency of asylum vouchers. A single asylum-seeker has to live on \u00a336.54 a week - 70 per cent of basic income support. A large proportion of the tiny sum, \u00a325, comes in vouchers. A study by Oxfam of life on the asylum dole found hunger and beggary. The Home Office took six weeks on average and three months at the extreme to deliver vouchers. When they arrived the indigent still couldn't afford baby milk, bus tickets, tampons and other luxuries. Refugees were often abused by check-out staff and shoppers when they produced vouchers at supermarkets, Oxfam continued. The stores themselves were, in a sadistic twist of the knife, authorised by the Home Office to pocket any change. New Labour is a novel social democratic movement: it's redistributing wealth from the dirt poor to Sainsbury's board of directors. Blair might have found time to tell the public about the misery and quash the canard that asylum-seekers are cosseted. But he's been a busy man. For all his evasion of duty, there is a chance of reform. Jack Straw told Parliament vouchers would stem an influx of foreigners whose claims were 'wholly without foundation [and] who come in principally to claim cash benefits'. If he was right, then asylum applications ought to have fallen in 2000 when vouchers were introduced. They rose. After the election, David Blunkett was promoted to the Home Office. He promised Blair he would 'make Jack Straw look like a liberal'. He was bragging, there's not a politician in Britain who can do that. But again it tells you something about the PM that Blunkett was obliged to make it. Blunkett proved his words were empty when he ordered a review of vouchers. A fierce Whitehall contest has been raging since. Straw and Blunkett would be contenders for the Labour leadership if Tony Blair should be crushed under a Big Mac. Both know Blunkett can please the backbenches and unions if he humiliates Straw by reversing a discredited policy. In the briefings which have followed, all kinds of sources are revealing where vouchers came from and why. The idea appeared from nowhere in 1999. Refugee charities tell me they had had long consultations with Government about dispersing asylum-seekers away from London and the South-East, but the suggestion that a new currency should be minted was made very late in the day. Mike O'Brien, the Immigration Minister, was dead against vouchers. Martha Wooldridge, a civil servant, had examined what was to be done with asylum-seekers and rejected them. Apart from anything else, she said, running a parallel currency was too expensive to be worth the bother. O'Brien was the man in charge and that should have been the end of the matter. He was overruled by Downing Street and Straw. They insisted on pauperising the genuine victims of torture, along with the undoubted chancers, and rejected O'Brien's further suggestion that asylum-seekers should be put in cheap hotels rather than dispersed to estates in cities such as Glasgow where they are now being murdered. The assault on refugees was a consequence of New Labour's adoption of Bill Clinton's degraded doctrine of triangulation. The theory holds that an allegedly centre-Left party must always follow the opposition, however far to the Right it staggers. Downing Street thought the Conservatives might make something of asylum at the next election. New Labour would neutralise the threat by being almost as nasty or nastier still; by 'out-niggering' them, as white politicians in the American Deep South used to say. O'Brien promoted a policy we now know he didn't support and was roundly abused by your correspondent and other critics. You might have thought that, after doing Blair's dirty work and drawing sustained abuse, O'Brien had the right to expect gratitude in return. Even Mafia bosses stick by compliant lieutenants. O'Brien was fired in the June reshuffle, not for telling lies about refugees but the truth about Peter Mandelson. Mandy went for the second time after O'Brien revealed he had lobbied him to give a billionaire friend of the political class, Prakash Hinduja, a passport. It was delivered with an alacrity which would stun a refugee waiting for years in fear and poverty for his case to be settled. Why Mandelson and O'Brien had to go when it was Straw who suggested to officials that Hinduja should have the special treatment of Zola Budd was never explained by the ludicrous Hammond report into the affair. But Blair's disloyalty to O'Brien fits a comprehensible and ignoble pattern. Harriet Harman was required by the Prime Minister and Chancellor to cut the benefits of single mothers and was then fired. Robin Cook was instructed by Blair to sell weapons to the genocidal rulers of Indonesia and then demoted. Ken Follett got the nature of his former friend just right when he wrote in this paper of the 'poison' spread by the centre against Ministers. There was something rotten about Blair, he said. He lacked the ability to live up to 'the behaviour my parents' generation called \"manly\"'. I haven't been to a church in years and am in no position to judge the clergy. I'd still like to know, though: How many vicars are there who exacerbate rather than confront racism? And how many reward their colleagues for taking the heat with a stab in the back?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
