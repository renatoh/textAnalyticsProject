Eight out of 10 FE students left with an academic or vocational certificate of some sort in 2000-01, up from 74.5% the previous year, according to the sector's funders, the Learning and Skills Council. Drop-out rates showed improvements too, with 13% of students leaving before the end of a course, down from 14.4% in 1999-2000. Last week, the Education Secretary, Estelle Morris, said the government was pressing ahead with plans to close or merge failing colleges or send in hit squads of external managers to turn them around. She also launched proposals to send lecturers back to school to learn how to teach better, saying the FE sector, which educates around four million people aged 16 and up, had to improve the quality of education it offered. Both Ms Morris and higher education minister Margaret Hodge have claimed that low achievement was an argument for reform. David Gibson, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said: \"This excellent news [the latest figures] is in marked contrast to recent ministerial statements about quality in local colleges. \"It demonstrates, as we have always claimed, that quality is already high, and rising at a significant rate. These results are even more impressive given that 25% of local college students come from the 15% most deprived wards in the country and that most colleges take all-comers - they are not selective.\" The LSC also reported a drop of 1.3% in the number of 16 to 19-year-olds studying in FE colleges, however, which chairman Bryan Sanderson said was a \"matter of concern\". FE colleges will play a crucial role in improving vocational education in England, are seen as vital to the future of the economy and to efforts to improving the nation's skills base. Mr Sanderson added: \"It is important that we recognise this and attract more young people into learning in the sector.\" The AoC are calling for support from the government to improve the sector. In particular they want maintenance grants for young people in colleges, Paul Mackney said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
