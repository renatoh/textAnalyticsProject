The village of Bar Hill, near Cambridge, is home to a 24-hour Tesco Extra superstore which is reputed to be the second-largest in the country, but it's pointless to try buying the Saturday edition of the Guardian there before about 9am. At least Mr Greenslade can buy his Saturday paper from a friendly and efficient newsagent. The only newsagent in Bar Hill closed in July after its lease expired and it couldn't afford the increased rent demanded by the landlord. Who was the landlord? Tesco. David Harper, Bar Hill, Cambridge \u00b7 Roy Greenslade's piece was spot on. Try asking some monosyllabic Tesco employee for all the pieces to a Sunday heavy - or any newspaper for that matter - and you'll always get a shrug. Tesco can deny it all it wants - but supermarkets are simply not capable of selling newspapers properly. They don't have the right counters, they don't have the right staff with the right attitude and, in my experience, newspapers and bar codes don't mix. Tesco is not alone. The sale of news-papers in the Twickenham and Teddington branches of M&amp;S is a shambles. But saddest of all? The dire performance of WH Smith in Richmond upon Thames. Yup - WH Smith! Newspaper publishers should take this very seriously. As Greenslade points out, the solution is obvious. Support your local newsagent! The quality of service at the Patel sub-post office and newsagents of Strawberry Hill, Twickenham, is second to none. Gary R Curtis, Twickenham \u00b7 Well done to MediaGuardian for publicising the problem with Tesco and newspapers. In my area (near Blackpool), two new Tesco Express stores took over shops which used to provide paper deliveries, but of course Tesco Express don't - and I despair at how they display the papers. In my experience, the local evening paper is frequently unceremoniously dumped on top of a fridge by the door, face down, with, at best, the bundle wrapper simply cut away. If we are not careful, with their discontinuation of deliveries and their cavalier attitude to display, Tesco will see off local papers, never mind the nationals. Tony Durkin, Lytham St Annes \u00b7 The horror story around here is United NorthWest Co-ops. Where I live in West Stockport, the Co-op embarked on what looked like a deliberate attempt to put local newsagents out of business so that it could then corner the newsagency trade. The Co-op stores open at 7am, but whether or not you get your entire newspaper is a lottery; and if it is Saturday or Sunday and the rostered teenage staff have slept in or have a hangover, forget the store opening on time. We now buy our papers and magazines from the last remaining independent retailer in the area at Heaton Chapel Rail Station. This is old-fashioned service from an old-fashioned newsagent who knows his stuff, whereas the Co-op employs teenagers on barely above minimum wage who have no interest or inclination in learning more about the goods they are selling. Paul Catlow, Stockport \u00b7 Roy Greenslade's attack on how supermarkets treat newspaper sales is fair enough, but to speak out in praise of newsagents is going too far. Agreed some are good. Most however are of the kind that don't carry too many copies of the Guardian (dangerously radical) and inform the police the moment you ask for the Morning Star or Socialist Worker.
