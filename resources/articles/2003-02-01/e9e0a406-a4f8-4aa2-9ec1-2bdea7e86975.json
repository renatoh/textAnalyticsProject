Seventeen votes and the shameful leadership of a prime minister who seems to have lost touch with a people he does not trust to elect their own representatives. The shambolic result of the many votes on the future of the constitution left the House of Commons laughing - but it wasn't funny. And it was all Tony Blair's fault. There is much to be said for the Blair plan for an entirely appointed House of Lords. Unfortunately all of it is bad. Oligarchy has its charms - but since the days of Cromwell those charms have eluded all but the oligarchs, where in the Lords gerontocracy masquerades as experience, bishops with empty pews represent an empty shell of faith and yesteryear's politicians are pensioned into a golden dotage. No surprise then that the old turkeys on the red benches did not vote for winter festival but for their own perpetuity without the inconvenience of a trip to the hustings where most could be guaranteed a roasting. Hybridity, they clucked, would be a very bad thing and they are right about that: there would be a strange divide between the legitimate and the illegitimate peers in any future House, part-elected and part-appointed. One hundred per cent democracy was the only possible outcome. How extraordinary it seems in the 21st century that, as we are about to go to war, yet again we are trumpeting for the democratic rights of far-away people, and still find it necessary to quote Winston Churchill: \"Democracy is the worst form of government, except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time\". How can Labour have let itself be out-reformed by Iain Duncan Smith - even if he commanded as little obedience as Blair. This progressive reform has waited a century: now the House of Lords will remain the laughing stock of the western world. Now the chance of reform has collapsed, all due to a moment of madness in which a prime minister already accused of anti-democratic instincts has done himself needless harm. Was it the insouciance of a mind floating somewhere between Washington and Baghdad? It felt dangerously like a Thatcher mistake, a droit de seigneur moment that reminds us that five-and-a-half years is beginning to look quite a long time in No 10 (though the lady hung on for 13). Robin Cook's brave open rebellion led the way for other big beasts to express serious dissent for the first time: Patricia Hewitt, Charles Clarke, Estelle Morris and David Milliband among a roll-call of honour. Trying to repair the damage, the Blair camp hints this was all a cunning plan. How clever of the dear leader to allow a little harmless dissent on an arcane issue to defuse a greater rumbling of unease on everything from Iraq to public service delivery. If so, that was too clever by half. It was cavalier treatment of an electorate that overwhelmingly wanted a democratic second chamber. It signified something that people suspect may be the truth, (egged on by the Tory press) - Tony Blair is losing his sure-footed third way nimbleness, his skill at ducking and weaving to keep most of the people more or less content most of the time. Does an arcane dispute over the archaic Lords really matter? The next cunning plan is to do nothing. There is no obligation to draw up a bill on Lords reform in this parliament. Let the sleeping turkeys roost through the next election: after all, it was always bizarre to choose how the Lords should be elected before deciding what its powers should be, or how big it should be. How would members be elected, from what size or type of constituency? If it is to shrink down from its present 690 members to a manageably small number who would (unlike the excessive 650 MPs in the Commons) have some chance of public recognition, then any hybrid appointed members would be few - and what sort of people? Surely not chosen by their position, rather than their personal qualities. Please god, not bishops, rabbis, monseigneurs and mullahs. Since the mob is not waving scythes outside Westminster, No 10 fixers may reckon this can stay in the pending file indefinitely. But last night's vote changes things. They reckon without Robin Cook in charge of the business of a House that has at least expressed its strongest preference for an 80% elected chamber. Tony Blair should step in at once, declare himself persuaded and call a further vote soon, this time backing democracy. The sad death of Roy Jenkins was a sharp reminder that once a shiny new prime minister seriously considered electoral reform. That was his chance to push proportional representation through his unwilling party in the first flush of success, alongside Scottish and Welsh devolution, just as he might have swept straight into a referendum on the euro: had Britain joined on day one, much later political pain might have been spared when the inevitable day comes to take that plunge. This is a low political moment. A cold February, mid-second term, would always be prone to low spirits - but Labour MPs and ministers have never been glummer. Few want war, there is tribal distaste for such closeness to an extreme rightwing White House and alarm at such distance from Europe. The \"project\" feels thin, lacking any new trajectory after the second election success. The work is hard, criticism nags at them wherever they go and there is no warm over-arching legend to sustain them through this bleak time. If Tony Blair thinks the message of the shocking turnout in 2001 was that the people don't care about politics, then he has miscalculated. People are cynical about politicians who never voluntarily share power and suspicious that democracy is a sham if all it means is a four-yearly chance to choose between two broad parties that are de facto coalitions already. Now this denial of democracy for the Lords confirms their worst mistrust. New Labour's record on the constitution has been a muddle of inherited obligations reluctantly carried out for London, Wales and Scotland, clumsily sabotaged by Blair's attempts at imposing his own candidates. He funked proportional representation that would have saved Britain ever again suffering a hard-right government elected by a minority: when Labour loses power, that regret will be bitter. Local government might have become a trusted partner if proportional representation had brought healthy coalitions to local politics instead of corrupt fiefdoms elected by fragments of the local population. Now is the time for a full constitutional commission (no, not royal, but the people's) to make sense of how power should be shared between two chambers, local councils and the regions with proportional voting. There is still time - just - for Tony Blair to enter the history books as the leader who forged a good constitution (but don't hold your breath.) p.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
