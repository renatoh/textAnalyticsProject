Emergency services were called to a stretch of the River Derwent in Darley Dale, close to Matlock, in the early hours of Friday morning, Derbyshire police said. Derbyshire was hit with more rainfall in 24 hours than it normally receives in a single month. The Environment Agency\u2019s gauge in Glossop, a market town on the edge of the Peak District, recorded 114mm of rain in the 24 hours up to 4am. Derbyshire receives an average of 90.7mm of rain for the month of November. Flooding has sparked huge transport disruption today, leaving thousands of commuters facing a battle to get to work. Train operators warned passengers not to travel on a series of routes through Yorkshire \u2013 particularly in the Sheffield area \u2013 and between Hebden Bridge and Rochdale in the north-west. Stranded shoppers who were forced to camp out for the night had to buy spare clothes from Primark as they sheltered from the floods. Saskia Hazelwood, 17, a student from Doncaster, who was among those trapped in Sheffield\u2019s Meadowhall shopping centre until 7am, told how she took refuge on sofas in M&amp;S. \u201cWe instantly started panicking and, when we found out there was no way of getting home, we went into Primark and all bought spare clothes and we bought food and drinks to keep us going throughout the night. As the clean up operation begins, the rainfall has eased off with little or none across the Midlands and north, bar the odd isolated shower. Tomorrow a weather front will move from Wales towards the east of England but it will fizzle out by the evening, according to the Met Office. While flood waters have left many stranded, one woman was determined not to let the weather get in the way of her journey to the shops. Footage captured by a passerby yesterday shows an older woman ploughing through flood water on her mobility scooter. As cars grind past at snail\u2019s pace, the scooter continues in determined fashion. Stephanie Jubb, who witnessed the scene in Sheffield and posted the video on her Facebook page with a caption reading \u201cOMG [Oh my God]\u201d, said: \u201cThe woman just started driving and we were like, \u2018she\u2019s not gonna do it, she\u2019s not gonna do it\u2019 and then she just carried on. She didn\u2019t even lift her legs up or anything.\u201d Jubb, who works in a pharmacy, said the woman later returned with shopping bags onboard her scooter. \u201cShe\u2019s come back through it with her shopping bags, but we didn\u2019t get that on tape,\u201d Jubb told PA Media. She said she could not believe the clip had gone viral, adding that she felt the clip illustrated \u201cnorthern spirit\u201d. \u201cThe people up north are quite strong. They just carry on doing their daily thing.\u201d More from Doncaster, as it has emerged one woman was rescued from her property and carried through flood waters on a man\u2019s back. Meanwhile, another resident, Lacey Hanrahan, was taken away with her baby by boat when water started flooding into her home. The 24-year-old told PA Media: \u201cI live down the end where there\u2019s a dip in the road, so we were one of the first to be affected. It got to the point where I wasn\u2019t able to walk out, so I was taken out on the boat. I just can\u2019t believe how deep the water has got.\u201d My colleague, Paul Scruton, has produced a map showing the array of flood warnings put out by the Environment Agency as of 10am this morning. Since then, the number has reduced to 70 in addition to six severe flood warnings, which indicate a risk to life. The emergency operation to find the woman whose body was recovered from flood water in Darley Dale involved a coastguard helicopter, a drone and mountain rescuers. Local worker Mark Hopkinson, who workd told BBC Radio Derby: \u201cThere was a police helicopter flying up and down this area as though they were looking for somebody or something. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know whether they were just checking the water levels or the extent of the flooding. Then police vehicles started turning up and we learned they were looking for a missing person. \u201cThey had people on the ground looking, and mountain rescuers. We saw a little drone go up and the coastguard helicopter came, and that was then circling, hovering over some trees.\u201d A woman\u2019s body has been pulled from flood water in Derbyshire after reports of someone being swept away by a river, police said. Emergency services were called to a stretch of the River Derwent in Darley Dale, close to Matlock, in the early hours of Friday morning, Derbyshire police said. A spokesman said:\u201cThe woman was reported as having been swept away by flood water in Rowsley and the body of what is believed to be the same woman was found in Darley Dale and was recovered at 10.40am. \u201cThe family of the woman have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this time. Formal identification has yet to take place.\u201d Stranded residents in Doncaster had to be rescued from their homes by boat yesterday as waist-high water filled the road. Rescue teams put down sandbags in an attempt to stem the flow of water, while police cars surrounded the area. One woman, who has lived in her home in Yarborough Terrace \u2013 near the banks of the River Don \u2013 for more than 20 years, said the downstairs of her property had filled with water at about 7am on Friday. \u201cI\u2019ve never known it to be this bad\u201d, she told PA Media. Another woman, who did not wish to be named, said she would have to house her daughter and grandchildren for the next few days because of the flooding. She said: \u201cWe\u2019ve just taken the decision to get out of here as soon as possible \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous as it is and it\u2019ll only get worse.\u201d South Yorkshire fire and rescue service received nearly 1,200 emergency calls in 24 hours. The service, which took more than 500 999 calls last night, said it has rescued more than 120 people. As people battle to get to work, the fire service is warning them not to put themselves at risk by entering flood water either by car or foot. Here\u2019s some pictures of the trail of devastation left behind by rainfall last night. In Rotherham, abandoned vehicles sit submerged in water in a car park. A member of the fire and rescue service wades through flood water as he escorts a JCB towing an truck along a flooded road in the town. Meanwhile, a smart car appears not to have made it to the gates of a warehouse because of rising waters. In Sheffield, a lorry struggles to drive through flood water near Meadowhall shopping centre, where people were trapped overnight because of the weather. Derbyshire was hit with more rainfall in 24 hours than it normally receives in a single month, the Guardian has confirmed. The Environment Agency\u2019s gauge in Glossop, a market town on the edge of the Peak District, recorded 114mm of rain in the 24 hours up to 4am. Derbyshire receives an average of 90.7mm of rain for the month of November. At local business Glossop Caravans, staff were forced to move dozens of vehicles to stop them being submerged in flood water. Receptionist Kirstie Booth told the Guardian: \u201cThe motorhomes were all moved on the main site. They had to be put on the top car park. The water was really deep. It\u2019s cleared up a lot now, we\u2019re still clearing up all the mud and leaves that it\u2019s left behind. \u201cThere\u2019s still a bit of a stream coming down off the top fields but it\u2019s not as bad as it was yesterday. I know someone came in and said it was nearly up to their knees at one point on the main road.\u201d Good news for those affected by the flooding as the Met Office says rainfall is due to ease off today with little or none across the Midlands and north, bar the odd isolated shower. Tomorrow a weather front will move from Wales towards the east of England but it will fizzle out by the evening. The Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge told the Guardian: \u201cIt may linger a little bit over the Midlands, I would be looking at Oxfordshire, Warwickshire. But we\u2019re not expecting significant rainfall. As of the moment, there\u2019s no plans to issue any warnings for that.\u201d Schoolchildren were forced to wade through freezing knee-high floodwater to get home yesterday in Sheffield after their bus was forced to stop because of the weather. Daniel Harrison, 12, was among children told to leave school early at 2pm on Thursday because of the flooding but says he and classmates had to walk because their bus could go no further. \u201cThe water was up to my knees,\u201d Daniel recalled, as he waited to catch a different bus this morning to get to school. Speaking to PA Media, he added: \u201cI had to get home straight away because the water was absolutely freezing. The river had completely opened and all the water had flooded on to the road, it was terrible. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be in that water but there was no choice \u2013 you had to go through it to get home.\u201d Villagers in South Yorkshire have described how they suffered \u201calmost biblical\u201d amounts of rainfall overnight. Kathleen Overton, a Post Office worker in Toll Bar, a village near Doncaster, told PA Media: \u201cIt must have started at around 9am yesterday when I was taking my grandson to school, and then it just didn\u2019t stop. At one point the water was coming right over my doorstep, and my daughters and I were worrying that it was going to come into the house.\u201d The village was also hit by severe flooding in June 2007. Overton, 61, added: \u201cPeople\u2019s cars were getting submerged in the water, gardens were ruined, you couldn\u2019t drive anywhere. It was carnage.\u201d Roy Kerr, 71, said the situation could have been far worse were it not for the help of young volunteers who put down sandbags and pumped out water. He said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as bad as it was in 2007, but it easily could have been if it wasn\u2019t for those lads.\u201d In Derbyshire, locals are bucketing water out of their cars this morning. The BBC\u2019s Heidi Booth reports from Darley Dale: Footage shows cars submerged and a Premier Inn sign peeking out from the waters: The flooding has also devastated farmers\u2019 livelihoods as they wake up to find their fields submerged in water. Andrew Ward, a farmer in Lincolnshire, which has also been hit by heavy rainfall, tweeted footage of rain covered fields this morning. He wrote: \u201cWe\u2019ve had wet periods but never as much as this and at this time of year. Situation is dire. The river is to the top, dykes can\u2019t empty so field drains not working. A lot of worried farmers in this area.\u201d He added: \u201cAnother 30mm yesterday and this is the result. In the last six weeks we\u2019ve had the amount of rain we usually get in six months. Not one acre planted and not looking too hopeful.\u201d Another farmer, Jono Dixon, in east Yorkshire, said his land had received 44mm of rainfall in 24 hours. He wrote: \u201cAfter the gloom of yesterday, wake-up sun is shining. However, not for long as the gloomy clouds are gathering again.\u201d Stranded shoppers who were forced to camp out for the night had to buy spare clothes from Primark as they sheltered from the floods. Saskia Hazelwood, 17, a student from Doncaster, who was among those trapped in Sheffield\u2019s Meadowhall shopping centre until 7am, told how she took refuge on sofas in M&amp;S. Her father tried to reach the shopping centre by car to rescue her but had to turn back because of the flood water. Hazelwood says shoppers were provided with free refreshments throughout the night but complained it was \u201cnot enough\u201d. She told PA news agency: \u201cWhen we got to Meadowhall it was very hectic and we heard about the flooding and saw the river about to burst. Our trains were then cancelled so we went to get food, then spoke to the police and security and they told us it was unsafe to leave and there was no way of getting in or out. \u201cSo we instantly started panicking and, when we found out there was no way of getting home, we went into Primark and all bought spare clothes and we bought food and drinks to keep us going throughout the night. \u201cWe were in M&amp;S for a while on the sofas until they closed the store, and we were then moved to the Oasis food quarter. We were there until 7am.\u201d Meanwhile, a photojournalist tweeted footage of river flood defences being breached near Meadowhall last night: Hazelwood added: \u201cWe were provided with free refreshments throughout the night and morning but it was certainly not enough. \u201cWe had to basically camp out in the food area until they finally got a taxi to us at 7am. None of us had slept for over 24 hours. We were very tired, stressed and, of course, our families were panicking and kept keeping in touch. \u201cMy dad even tried driving to us around 11.30pm but, because the centre was gridlocked and also flooded and shut off, he wasn\u2019t able to get to us and so he had to turn around and go home. \u201cAt the start we thought it would be fun, a nice sleepover, something to certainly remember, but after 14 hours of being stranded in Meadowhall we just couldn\u2019t wait to get home, get into our own beds, feel safe again, and catch up on sleep.\u201d My colleague, Rachel Obordo, the Guardian\u2019s community editor, wants to hear from you.

Sky\u2019s Steph Oliver has made it through flood water to assess the scene this morning in Rotherham\u2019s town centre: A determined lone commuter wades through waist-high flood water with his bike. Asked if he was cold, he replied that his bike will keep him warm. \u201cI would have turned back if I felt the current was too strong,\u201d Michael the cyclist tells Sky. The River Don is following very high near the city\u2019s train station: More from the trapped shoppers last night as 12-year-old Dakota Hallam tells a reporter how she was stuck at Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield. The schoolgirl told LBC yesterday: \u201cI don\u2019t know how long but we\u2019ve been here absolutely ages.\u201d She added: \u201cWe\u2019ve asked Greggs [the shop] if they were going to stay overnight and they\u2019re staying overnight so we might as well.\u201d Meanwhile, Hannah Crossley, who was also trapped at the shopping centre, tweeted this video that apparently showed the scene outside Meadowhall last night: She later tweeted that she had made it home: Meadowhall, which says it is reopening at 10am this morning, said at 10.46pm last night that the \u201cmajority of customers left the building\u201d but that there were \u201ca small number of people who have chosen to stay with us for now\u201d. Flooding has sparked huge transport disruption today, leaving thousands of commuters facing a battle to get to work. Train operators are warning passengers not to travel on a series of routes through Yorkshire \u2013 particularly in the Sheffield area \u2013 and between Hebden Bridge and Rochdale in the north-west. Network Rail, which owns Britain\u2019s rail infrastructure, said track inspections would take place \u201cwhere possible\u201d. Northern rail warned disruption could continue into the weekend despite the weather improving in many areas. The company has issued an update on blocked lines: A spokesman told PA Media: \u201cWe are still advising customers on several routes not to travel as flooding is making rail and road travel extremely difficult. \u201cColleagues at Network Rail are inspecting the tracks and working hard to return them to normal, but at present we have no estimate as to when we will be able to operate services on the affected routes.\u201d Other train companies hit by the weather include CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, LNER, TransPennine Express, Transport for Wales and Virgin Trains. The BBC weather forecaster Simon King gives a good summary of the numbers on rainfall in south Yorkshire as of 7.45am. Meanwhile, readers can view the Environment Agency\u2019s flood warnings in their area and across the country here, which are updated constantly. And for those wondering how the weather will fare later, King tweets: One villager near Sheffield described how he had a sea of water across his carpets in his home this morning following the rain \u2013 and up to four feet outside. James Barber, who lives in the village of Whiston, near Sheffield in south Yorkshire, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThis morning it seems to have subsided quite a bit. It got to its peak at around two o\u2019clock this morning. In our house it got to about seven inches or so in the lower levels.\u201d Asked if he had a sea of water across his floors and carpets, he replied: \u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d adding: \u201cBut outside, in the yard, in the drive, it got to about four feet.\u201d He continued: \u201cI moved my car out earlier on and I\u2019m really glad I did because we thought that the pinnacle of it was at around three o\u2019clock yesterday afternoon.\u201d An emergency contractor from Streets Ahead, which has been helping local residents overnight, also told the programme: \u201cWe\u2019ve got teams our there. They\u2019ve been supporting members of the public providing sandbags. We\u2019ve been taking people out of their cars that\u2019ve been flooded, trying to remove those flood waters from roads to allow people to commute through the city.\u201d The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has tweeted about the floods this morning: Sheffield city council has issued an update on road closures as of 7am. Rotherham council did the same last night at 1.55am. Meanwhile, Derbyshire olice have issued a warning about motorists driving in flood water: Nearly a month\u2019s worth of rainfall has fallen in Sheffield in 24 hours, according to the Met Office. The forecaster told the Guardian 75.6mm of rain fell in the city up to 6am this morning, compared with a monthly average for the whole of November in Yorkshire of 89.7mm. Five severe flood warnings remain in place, 117 flood warnings and 121 flood alerts. The Met Office forecaster Craig Snell said: \u201cOver the last 24 hours it\u2019s been a very wet. It\u2019s come after a wetter than average October so it\u2019s almost been the worst possible combination for Sheffield. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very wet autumn and yesterday was extremely wet, almost a month\u2019s worth of rain falling in 24 hours over an urban area. It\u2019s never a good combination. That\u2019s why we are seeing the flooding across parts of Sheffield.\u201d Good morning, folks. Simon Murphy here, I\u2019ll be liveblogging the latest developments in Yorkshire and the Midlands, where torrential rain has caused flooding that has led to chaos overnight. Hundreds of shoppers were trapped in shopping centres in both Sheffield and Rotherham. Many homes have been forced to evacuate and 116 flood warnings remain in place, the majority of them in Yorkshire. The Met Office predicts flooding rains will clear, moving south-east by lunchtime. But, as the clean-up operation begins, flood warnings are expected to remain in place for several days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
