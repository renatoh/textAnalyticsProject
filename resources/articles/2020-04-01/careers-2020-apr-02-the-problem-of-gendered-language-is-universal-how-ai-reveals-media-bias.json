If the answer to this question seems obvious to you, that\u2019s because logically it is. But it also demonstrates the power of language to shape our thinking and influence our behaviour. \u201cGendered language is understood as language that has a bias towards a particular gender [and] reflects and maintains pre-existing social distinctions,\u201d explains Roxana Lupu, an expert in applied linguistics. It shows us two things \u2013 not only does it \u201csignal the presence of sexism in the society\u201d, but it also \u201creinforces those beliefs and perceptions\u201d. To put it simply: gendered language is that which promotes bias towards one gender, while simultaneously entrenching such bias further. For a relatively new field of study in sociolinguistics (gendered language only rose to academic prominence in the 1970s), it has had no shortage of attention \u2013 emerging alongside second-wave feminism, it deepened the collective understanding of how gender discrimination is proliferated, both directly and indirectly. Lupu believes the media plays a fundamental role in disseminating gendered language among the population. \u201cWe need to raise awareness to drive change,\u201d she says. But raising awareness is hindered by a lack of information on just how big the problem is. That\u2019s where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in. \u201cNever before have we had the capability to analyse language in such a meaningful way at such massive scale,\u201d says Rich Wilson, owner of Deviance (a technology company that focuses on language analytics). \u201cThis represents a huge opportunity for broad areas such as cultural or gender research,\u201d he continues, which means that \u201cevidence is now indisputable and quantifiable rather than just anecdotal.\u201d It was precisely this thinking that inspired a recent media coverage study conducted by a female-led marketing agency, Mac+Moore, with the support of Deviance. As marketeers, the brand\u2019s founders, Jess MacIntyre and Natalie Moores, spend a large portion of their time discussing the power of language and messaging with their clients. \u201cWe work closely with companies to craft and shape the way they communicate with their audience,\u201d Moores says, \u201cso we know better than most how language can be a very powerful and persuasive tool \u2013 and has the ability to shape people\u2019s perception.\u201d The difference in the media\u2019s treatment of men and women is a topic that has been growing in coverage over the past decade. Savvy brands such as Gillette have been using their marketing campaigns to highlight \u2013 and challenge \u2013 gender discrimination and how it damages women. But Mac+Moore wanted to take this one step further. \u201cWe wanted to produce a data set that irrefutably demonstrated how gendered language is used in the media,\u201d says Moores, \u201cso that we had hard evidence that couldn\u2019t just be dismissed as \u2018an opinion\u2019.\u201d Using a technique known as comparative linguistics (where two data sets are analysed in relation to one another), Deviance\u2019s software would enable them to analyse in a detailed way any linguistic differences in the way men and women are described in the source material. Not only this, but it would enable the analysis of articles by publications from all across the UK\u2019s media landscape at a volume higher than humans alone have ever been able to process \u2013 and in only a matter of hours. \u201cAI is perfect because it allows the analysis to be completely removed from any bias that we may have \u2013 it allows for complete neutrality,\u201d says MacIntyre. \u201cWe chose the Labour leadership race as source material because it\u2019s so topical and, what\u2019s more, there\u2019s never been a female leader of the party, but the odds of one being elected in this contest were four to one,\u201d says Moores. \u201cStatistically, it is more likely than ever that a woman will be elected, which would enable us to see with more clarity how gendered language is affecting the candidates\u2019 chances \u2013 for better or for worse.\u201d And so they fed 145,000 words through the software, sourced from recent coverage of all five candidates from a broad cross-section of the media\u2019s online content \u2013 amounting to 250 articles in total. The results were startling: articles covering the only man in the race, Keir Starmer, were 4.4 times more likely to describe him using words meaning \u201cpreferred\u201d and \u201cfavoured\u201d, whereas the female candidates were 1.9 times more likely to be described using words such as \u201cbrave\u201d (arguably patronising in this context), \u201csad\u201d, \u201cviolent/angry\u201d, and \u201cdislike\u201d. Moreover, the results show that there is a huge focus on gender through the use of titles such as \u201cMs\u201d or \u201cMrs\u201d, which they were three times more likely to use for female candidates, whereas Starmer was referred to mostly by just his surname or the honorific \u201cSir\u201d, which holds a positive connotation. Finally, Starmer was 1.6 times more likely to be discussed in terms of professional employment, politics, law and order, and belonging to a group, whereas the female candidates were much more likely to be discussed in relation to their families and, particularly, their fathers. Not just this, but the web scraper tool used on the first analysis picked up the content of digital advertising on each website. \u201cThis revealed that whenever a female candidate was discussed, ads were served against the content for clothing, fashion and beauty,\u201d says MacIntyre. \u201cThis never happened for Keir Starmer \u2013 the adverts served in articles for him were much more gender neutral.\u201d This, they believe, indicates an entrenched data bias in the software used by digital ad services that could potentially influence who consumes the content, \u201cthe implication being that articles written about female candidates are only relevant for female readers\u201d, says MacIntyre. \u201cThere is strong evidence to support the theory that women are being portrayed and represented within the media in an overly negative and gendered way, which could be impacting the outcome of election campaigns,\u201d says Moores, \u201cand the implications of this are potentially huge both in politics but also wider society.\u201d The two women are energised by the research and plan to use the results to push for companies to think more carefully about how content is presented. \u201cAlthough these results tell the story of one leadership election, the problem of gendered language is universal,\u201d says MacIntyre. More than anything, the study demonstrates how AI can drive forward our awareness of the scale of the problem of gendered language: the first step to addressing the issue. \u201cThe media has a responsibility to contribute to an equal society,\u201d says Lupu. For Wilson, \u201cif AI can help to highlight a path to progress, then we should grasp that opportunity with both hands.\u201d MacIntyre agrees: \u201cAfter all, if the world is changing, why shouldn\u2019t our language change too?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false}}}
