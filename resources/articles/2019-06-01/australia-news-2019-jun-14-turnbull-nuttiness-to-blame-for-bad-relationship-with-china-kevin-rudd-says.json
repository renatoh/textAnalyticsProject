Rudd, who is now the director of the Asia Society Policy Institute based in New York, and is studying for a PhD on Chinese president Xi Jinping at Oxford University, spoke at the Lowy Institute in Sydney on Thursday night in an unguarded manner, repeatedly expressing his disdain for Donald Trump whom he called \u201cthe Trumpster\u201d or \u201cthe Donald\u201d and comparing China\u2019s state-run media to News Corp. But Rudd saved his most scathing comments of the evening for Turnbull, referencing an incident in December 2017 during the controversy about foreign interference and Labor MP Sam Dastyari\u2019s connections with China. When asked if he felt \u201cbullied or intimidated\u201d by China, Turnbull invoked a famous Chinese slogan to declare Australia would \u201cstand up\u201d against meddling in its national affairs. Switching between Mandarin and English, Turnbull said: \u201cModern China was founded in 1949 with these words: \u2018The Chinese people have stood up\u2019. It was an assertion of sovereignty, it was an assertion of pride. And we stand up and so we say, the Australian people stand up.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On Thursday night, Rudd said politicians needed to \u201cbe very judicious about when you open your big mouth\u201d. \u201cBy which I mean, Turnbull\u2019s egregious statement that the Australian people have stood up. That stuff that he did at the end of 2017, that was just nuts, it was domestically and politically self-indulgent nuttiness.\u201d Rudd said he was in Beijing at the time of the comments, and the discussion of foreign interference was passing by without much attention from Chinese leaders. \u201cAnd then suddenly, in thunders Malcolm, and he picks the phrase that Mao Zedong used\u2026 Picks that phrase, or blabs it out in his own appalling rendition of Chinese, and then suddenly it was in every Chinese headline. \u201cYou want to pick the day when the relationship went, in my judgment unnecessarily, down the gurgle [sic], it was that day, so just be judicious about when you embark upon public language.\u201d Rudd also made a jibe at News Corp, of which he has been a vocal critic since leaving office, calling Rupert Murdoch \u201cthe greatest cancer on the Australian democracy\u201d. Rudd said that after the Chinese government decided on their \u201cred lines\u201d in the dispute with the US over tariffs, the government\u2019s position then \u201cmysteriously\u201d appeared on the front page of all the Chinese newspapers. \u201cIt\u2019s like News Limited,\u201d he said. Speaking about the ongoing trade war between China and the US, which has seen the US impose tariffs of 25% on some Chinese goods sold in the US, Rudd said there was an \u201coverwhelming\u201d economic case for the two countries to reach a deal, but there was a question of whether they could overcome the political barriers to do so. \u201cI think we\u2019re in a 50-50 territory about the likelihood of producing an agreement,\u201d he said. Rudd pointed to the relative weakness of China\u2019s domestic economy and the fact that Trump will not want to spook Wall Street in the lead-up to next year\u2019s election as motivation for the two leaders to reach an agreement. \u201cThe Trumpster knows two things, one is, I read opinion polls, and two is, I read the Dow. That\u2019s all the Trumpster\u2019s interested in... So he knows how skittish Dow sentiment is on the question of can there be a deal done on trade, so he at that level wants it done.\u201d But Rudd said one of the most challenging things for allies of the US including Australia was dealing with a \u201cbifurcated American administration\u201d in which the president had one view, but his departments and the bureaucracy of the administration might have another. \u201c[T]here is Trump-land up here which is deeply transactional and deeply non-strategic, in the sense of where does America want to be in five, 10, 15, 20 years\u2019 time? What is China\u2019s role in the future of that world? \u2026 That\u2019s not the way the Donald thing, never has been and never will be. So the danger that European and Asian allies encounter with America\u2019s chief executive and commander-in-chief is, what does he say tomorrow?\u201d Rudd, who served as a diplomat in Beijing before entering politics and speaks Mandarin, said in order to engage well with its regional neighbours, Australia needed to show respect, which he said was \u201csomething which doesn\u2019t necessarily come easily to the Australian way of thinking\u201d and said a key way of doing this was to learn the languages of the region. \u201cI\u2019ve been preaching this message for 30 years now: a much much bigger slab of us need to be comfortably bilingual and trilingual in our own region, just as a matter of what I call disciplinary etiquette,\u201d he said. Rudd added that it wasn\u2019t easy for him to learn Mandarin, which he describes as \u201ca crazy language to learn if you\u2019re an Anglo and grew up in rural Queensland\u201d, but said: \u201cI think this is a mark of respect \u2026 Every now and then a Chinese leader will say to you, it means a lot to us that you bothered.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
