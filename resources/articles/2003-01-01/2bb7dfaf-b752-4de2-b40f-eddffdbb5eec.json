Hundreds of travel agents, villa companies and internet travel sites have side-stepped the bonding that protects passengers in the event of a company collapse by selling flights, accommodation and car hire separately. The Civil Aviation Authority has asked the Department of Transport to change the regulations to outlaw these \"split contracts\": the changes are expected to be cleared later this year. Agents, villa companies and hotel websites that sell flights or other elements such as car hire as well as accommodation will be forced to take out an Air Travel Organiser's Licence (Atol), which will guarantee passengers a full refund or repatriation from abroad if their company collapses. But the change in regulations will not protect passengers on scheduled airlines. This means that low-cost airlines can continue to sell accommodation on linked, though separately operated, websites in addition to their flights without an Atol. Helen Simpson, director of consumer protection at the CAA, said: \"There was a lot of recognition that contract splitting represents a real gap in protection.\" She added that many felt it was a \"major flaw in the system that scheduled airline sales weren't protected even where passengers bought accommodation from a linked supplier.\" She said this couldn't be changed by regulation but \"we may recommend more fundamental changes later\". The closing of the loophole was welcomed by Noel Josephides, deputy chairman of the Association of Independent Tour Operators (Aito): \"This is particularly important because we believe that this is going to be a difficult year ... There are likely to be more collapses than usual.\" He also warned that the popular \"fail-safe\" protection of booking by credit card was under threat. \"We are the only country in the European Union that makes credit companies liable in the event of a collapse. This is almost certain to be lost within the next two years as the pressures grow for harmonisation within the EU.\" In the past 16 years, the CAA has dealt with 330 tour operator failures; 190,000 people have been repatriated and more than a million others given refunds at a total cost of \u00a3159 million. In the last year alone, 7,000 people have been rescued and 13,000 refunded at a cost of \u00a313.7m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
