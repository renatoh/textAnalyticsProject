He defended Mauritius and the Chagos Islanders, who were cheated from their homeland by the British government 40 years ago to make way for the US base. The islanders now live mainly in Mauritius, which is seeking to regain sovereignty over the islands. He expressed surprise that Britain allowed the issue to drag on into the 21st century and criticised Tony Blair and the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, for failing to meet the Mauritius prime minister, Paul Berenger, during a visit to London yesterday. The Commonwealth secretary general, speaking at a press conference after talks with Mr Berenger, said: \"People do not like being lifted up and taken away from their homes. It is not the kind of thing you could get away with today.\" Mr McKinnon, a New Zealander and normally mild mannered, said: \"There is an issue here that needs a political solution. I am sorry that the prime minister [Berenger] says he is not able to meet the British prime minister or foreign secretary. These are issues that can only really be resolved at a very high level.\" Mr Berenger has threatened to leave the Commonwealth to pursue a legal action against Britain to regain sovereignty of the Chagos Islands. He met lawyers in London last night but said no decision had been made. On the question of leaving the Commonwealth, he said: \"We will do it broken heartedly, but we will do it.\" Mauritius's anger is over recent changes to the law by Britain denying the islanders a right to resettle in their homeland. A further change was made this week to prevent Mauritius taking Britain to the international court of justice. Mr McKinnon also criticised Britain over these changes on the eve of Mr Berenger's visit. \"You do not hit someone over the head before they come to your front gate.\" The Foreign Office hinted yesterday that it was prepared to pay extra compensation to the Indian Ocean islanders, a resolution that found favour with some but saw others maintain that they would not give up the fight to return to their homeland. Britain separated the Chagos archipelago, which includes Diego Garcia, from Mauritius in 1965 to set up the British Indian Ocean Territory, in order to provide the US with an air base. It evacuated the population of 2,000, scattering them to Mauritius, the Seychelles, and the UK. The latest confrontation began with a June 10 British ruling that the islanders will not be allowed to resettle on the Chagos archipelago. This angered both Mauritius and the former inhabitants. Foreign Office minister Bill Rammell said in a Commons debate this week that the British government had already made two payments to the islanders, amounting in today's money to \u00a314.5m. But a Foreign Office source said: \"If people make a representation, we are constitutionally bound to look at it.\" He made it clear that should be read as a hint of more cash. The comment contrasts with efforts made by the Foreign Office until now to fight off a legal action by one of the island leaders, Olivier Bancoult, for more compensation. Britain is also offering to organise a return trip by the islanders to visit the graves of their relatives on the 52 islands that make up the archipelago, other than Diego Garcia. But the government will promise it will also approach the US for permission for the islanders to visit graves on Diego Garcia itself. Allen Vincatassin, a spokesman for the islanders in the UK, yesterday welcomed the prospect of compensation. He said that, of the original islanders, 20 were living in the UK, 400 in Mauritius, and 300 in the Seychelles. He said most were in poverty. Asked about compensation, he suggested that, since the islanders would have been given land and a house if they had resettled in the Chagos archipelago, they should each be given land and a house, and a pension. He added that acceptance of compensation should not mean the end of their claim to a right of return. Some islanders in Mauritius take a tougher line and remain intent on resettlement. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour MP campaigning for the islanders and who initiated the Commons debate, said they should not face a choice between compensation or resettlement. \"These are two separate issues,\" he said. \"They've a right of return, and an absolute right to compensation.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
