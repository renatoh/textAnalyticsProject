Yang, an Australian citizen and globally influential pro-democracy political blogger, has been held by China\u2019s Ministry of State Security since being detained in Guangzhou in January. After months held in secret detention, Yang\u2019s conditions of incarceration had eased, but sources with knowledge of his case have told the Guardian his maltreatment was now growing worse. For some of his incarceration, he had been subjected to a single interview each month during which he was not shackled, but the last 10 days had seen a return to daily interrogation sessions, sometimes commencing at midnight, while his wrists and ankles were held in chains. Yang is granted one half-hour consular visit each month. His already limited contact from family has been cut off: letters are not being delivered and verbal messages are not being passed on. He has still not been allowed to communicate with his lawyers, after nearly 11 months in detention. Yang\u2019s Australian defence lawyer, the human rights advocate Robert Stary, said Chinese officials were attempting to isolate Yang from the outside world. \u201cChinese security officials have already blocked all written messages, letters, books and documents from being passed to Dr Yang. Not a single letter of support has been passed on, including multiple letters each month from his immediate family. There is a plain attempt to have Dr Yang be subjected to interrogation in complete isolation, cut off entirely from his loved ones and supporters.\u201d Stary said Yang was \u201cnothing more than a political prisoner\u201d. \u201cHe is not alone, he is not without support, and it is imperative that he is aware of this.\u201d Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, confirmed reports of the resumption of daily interrogations and the shackling of Yang, and said his treatment was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \u201cWe have made repeated requests to the Chinese authorities for an explanation of the charges against Dr Yang. We have also made repeated requests for him to be afforded basic standards of justice, procedural fairness, and humane treatment\u2026 including access to his lawyers and to his family, both of which continue to be denied to him. \u201cThis has not led to any substantive changes in his treatment.\u201d The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia \u201chas to stand up for our citizens\u201d. He said he was deeply concerned by the treatment of Yang and said Australia would continue to advocate on his behalf. Another of Yang\u2019s lawyers, Sarah Condon, said Yang had been in good health before being detained. \u201cHe is now being told that he is suffering high blood pressure, and has serious problems with his kidney function. We understand that he is being given a number of unknown and unspecified \u2018medications\u2019, up to nine tablets daily. \u201cWe also understand that during interrogations, which are now taking place on a daily basis, that Dr Yang\u2019s wrists and feet are being shackled. He is being interrogated in a repetitive fashion. Despite being incarcerated now for many, many months, Dr Yang continues to be denied access to his lawyers.\u201d Yang\u2019s lawyers say the increased pressure is a reflection of an increased desperation from the ministry of state security for a confession, and efforts to \u201cbreak\u201d Yang. However, they say he has continued to deny all allegations of espionage. The ministry has until March before his case must be brought before a court, according to Chinese law. The conviction rate for those accused of a crime in China is 99%, in a criminal justice system almost entirely reliant on \u201cconfessions\u201d obtained through long, secretive detentions. Yang has not been given any detail about his alleged offence, but he has been charged with spying for a foreign power. There are a range of espionage charges under Chinese law, carrying penalties from three years imprisonment to execution. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Previous reports of Yang\u2019s interrogations suggest he has been repeatedly told he faces execution, that his country has abandoned him, and his family and friends have betrayed him. \u201cA [ministry of state security] investigation officer told me that Australia was small and wouldn\u2019t care about me,\u201d the writer said in a message relayed from detention earlier this month. \u201cHe said Australia was dependent on China for its trade and economy, and Canberra wouldn\u2019t help me, let alone rescue me. \u201cHe said Australia wouldn\u2019t help because I am not white. This is nonsense. He was wrong.\u201d Yang\u2019s former doctoral supervisor in Australia, Dr Feng Chongyi, said he believed \u201cthe Chinese authorities want to wind up the case and convict Yang\u201d. \u201cBut they have not got the evidence, therefore they have renewed and increased the pressure to \u2018break\u2019 him and coerce a confession from him,\u201d Feng, an associate professor in China Studies at the University of Technology Sydney, said. Fifty-four-year-old Yang, whose legal name in Yang Jun, was born in Hubei in central China. He was formerly a diplomat for China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, before working in the private sector in Hong Kong and moving to Australia, then to the US. A writer of spy novels, he has been a popular blogger, political commentator and agitator for democratic reforms in China for more than a decade. Yang, who became an Australian citizen in 2002, had been living in the United States, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University, before flying to Guangzhou with his family in January. His wife and child were able to enter China, but authorities escorted Yang from the plane into detention. He was initially held under a system known as \u201cresidential surveillance at a designated location\u201d, a type of secret detention of up to six months in which authorities can deny a suspect access to lawyers and to family, and restrict external communication. In July Yang was moved to a Beijing detention centre in the lead-up to being charged. Yang\u2019s long-running detention continues at a time of acute strain in relations between Canberra and Beijing, with Australia in the so-called \u201cdiplomatic freezer\u201d, enjoying little high-level access to the regime. And with relations already laboured over a laundry-list of issues \u2013 Chinese telco Huawei\u2019s 5G ban by Australia\u2019s Foreign Investment Review Board; allegations of Chinese interference in Australian education and political systems; and Beijing\u2019s military expansionism in the South China Sea \u2013 allegations aired in the Australian media last week that a self-declared China spy has sought to defect have angered the Chinese regime further. An editorial in the state-run China Daily said Australia was \u201closing the plot\u201d. \u201cA \u2018China threat\u2019 storm is building in Australia. If unchecked, this ill wind, which has been blowing steadily in recent years and taken its toll on China-Australia ties, will gain enough force to shatter the foundations of bilateral interaction.\u201d Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, has previously raised Yang\u2019s case with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, saying Australia held \u201cserious concerns\u201d for Yang\u2019s welfare and the conditions of his detention. She said there was \u201cno basis\u201d for any allegation he was a spy. A spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, Geng Shuang, has warned Australia against \u201cinterference\u201d in the case. \u201cChina deplores the Australian statement on this case \u2026 the Australian side should earnestly respect China\u2019s judicial sovereignty and must not ... interfere with a Chinese case,\u201d he said. He said Yang\u2019s arrest had been handled in accordance with the law and that the Australian citizen was in good health."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
