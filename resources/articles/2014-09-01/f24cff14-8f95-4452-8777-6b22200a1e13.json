The seven-year-old is justly popular but he has never won over six furlongs and Friday\u2019s times suggest the ground has not yet dried out to the sort of fast surface that suits him. Perverse though it may seem to oppose him with a rival who has also done all his winning at five furlongs, Extortionist (3.50) looks as though he may improve for the extra distance, having finished strongly in all his recent races. Most notably he was only half a length behind Sole Power in the Nunthorpe last time and 14-1 is attractive. He is only three years old, with his best days to come. Horses of that age have won this race four times since 2003. 1.55 Ascot Don\u2019t Call Me has a fine record at this track and is only 2lb higher for his success on Shergar Cup day. 2.05 Haydock A stablemate of Don\u2019t Call Me, Barnet Fair may give Dandy Nicholls a quick double in valuable sprints. He impressed in winning the Stewards\u2019 Cup consolation last time and had previously gone close over this course and distance. 2.20 Kempton When last seen Secret Number was finally making good on the promise he had long shown. A chance is taken on his fitness after such a long absence in a race his trainer does well in. 2.40 Haydock There are a couple of tricky rivals in the line-up but Captain Cat looks the pick of these. He was poorly ridden when beaten in a Group Two a fortnight ago. 2.55 Kempton A winner here in June, Buckstay was only narrowly beaten at Glorious Goodwood last time. 3.15 Haydock Circumstances conspired against Big Thunder in his two latest starts but he is only 1lb higher than when scoring over this course and distance last autumn. 3.30 Ascot A most surprising change of tactics caused Trip To Paris to flop at the Shergar Cup. He may show that form to be all wrong this time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
