Today it is tempting to yield to the feeling that the country is also simply accursed. In the last few years, Haiti's 200-year history of political violence and instability has given way to a catastrophic series of natural disasters, including four devastating hurricanes in one year alone. Now this. Founded by the only successful slave revolution in the history of the western hemisphere, Haiti has been a pariah state since its independence in 1804. The US and European powers surrounding it maintained slave regimes until the mid-19th century, and had no aid or comfort for an independent black nation in their midst. More recently it has been in the interest of the forces of globalisation to keep Haiti at the bottom of the economic food chain, at the bottom of the western hemisphere's wage scale. In serving those interests, foreign powers, notably the US right wing, have interfered perniciously in its internal affairs, contributing, since 1990, to the overthrow of two elected governments. To the extent that the interests of globalisation are responsible for global warming, even the hurricanes may be blamed on them. But no one has yet found a way to trace an earthquake to political, economic or human agency. What does it mean? First of all, thousands have died: those who migrated, once 200-year-old subsistence agriculture practices proved unable to support them, from the deforested and eroded countryside to the shantytowns of the capital. Many thousands more will die in the days to come, thanks to Haiti's lamentably inadequate infrastructure, which ensures help will not reach them efficiently, or at all. The ranks of the nameless dead will be, today and for several more tomorrows, enormously increased. But Haitians are expert in survival against all odds. They had been doing it for a century before their nation had a name. They now need this more than ever, but at least they have it. And they are also fortunate in that their cultural treasure is not so much bound up in architectural monuments (most of which, in the capital at least are now rubble). A spiritual resource is that much more difficult to destroy. A disaster on this scale is opportunity for opportunism as well as an opportunity to do some real good; Haiti will undoubtedly get its share of both. Already some Haitians are saying they may come out of this with clean-swept ground on which to rebuild. They'll need a lot of help from the world in that. Let us try to remember as we try to help that we have as much to gain from Haiti spiritually as we have to give materially; that we don't need to remake this country in our own image (whenever we try that we fail); that we don't want to turn Haitians into shadows of ourselves but to help them survive \u2013 flourish even \u2013 as who they are."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
