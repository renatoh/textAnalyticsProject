Snow Ridge set a new record for two-year-olds over Ascot's round course when coming from seventh place with less than a quarter of a mile to travel to beat Moscow Ballet with something in hand. His mark lasted only 35 minutes, though, until Red Bloom went faster still in the Group One Fillies' Mile. Snow Ridge was cut to 10-1 joint-favourite with Yeats for next year's Derby by Coral, although 16-1 is still available with Ladbrokes. Marcus Tregoning, his trainer, is also hopeful that the son of Indian Ridge will have enough speed to run in the 2,000 Guineas, for which he is 14-1 (from 25-1) with Hill's. \"I was worried for a while, but he has shown tremendous speed at home so I can't say that I am surprised by what he did,\" Tregoning said. \"He wants to grow up and learn a bit, but it would be fun to think of the Derby.\" Red Bloom is 10-1 joint-favourite for the 1,000 Guineas with Hill's, who cut her from 25-1 after her one-and-a-quarter length defeat of Sundrop. \"I thought she did it very well and she is an exciting prospect,\" Sir Michael Stoute, her trainer, said. \"That will be it until next season.\" Four fillies were withdrawn from Saturday's race as a result of the firm ground, and the withdrawals continued yesterday with more than 20 declared runners failing to get to the stalls. Ten were scratched from the Mail on Sunday Handicap Final alone, in which the excellent apprentice Lisa Jones scored the most valuable success of her career on James Toller's Pagan Prince. The Group Three Cumberland Lodge Stakes also lost several leading candidates, allowing High Accolade to dominate from the front and come clear of Compton Bolter in the straight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
