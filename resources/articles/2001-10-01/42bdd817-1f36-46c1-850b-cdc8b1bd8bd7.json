The British Chambers of Commerce used the publication of its quarterly economic review - which shows business confidence, exports and order books in the manufacturing sector declining sharply - to demand a package of confidence-boosting measures from Gordon Brown. \"Manufacturing needs some intensive care, and while the Bank of England's recent cuts offered the right kind of medicine, it may not yet be enough to bring the sector back to health,\" said David Lennan, the BCC's director-general, who described the state of manufacturing as critical. He said: \"It is essential in the coming months that government does all it can to target support at those sizes of firm, sectors and regions worst hit and with the worst prospects.\" The BCC's survey of more than 7,000 firms shows com panies across the economy suffering their worst quarter for three years, but cashflow is highlighted as a particular problem, with manufacturing firms reporting that their finances are in their worst condition since 1992. Mr Lennan called on the government to help cash-strapped firms by extending the VAT and National Insurance relief given to foot and mouth-hit firms to all small manufacturers, and said he hoped the chancellor would use his pre-Budget report in November to bolster business confidence. The survey shows the service sector still holding off the full force of the global slowdown, although falling business confidence and the lowest investment intentions since 1993 suggest the situation is deteriorating. Analysts said the fact that most regions responded to the BCC survey before the attacks on the World Trade Centre meant there could be worse to come for British industry. \"The figures almost certainly underestimate the impact of the events of September 11 by a considerable margin,\" said Simon Rubinsohn of stockbroking firm Gerrard. In London, the only region where the survey was completed after the attacks, manufacturers' confidence about future profitability fell 48 points, compared to eight points for the country as a whole. The BCC welcomed the two quarter-point rate cuts since September 11, but called for a further reduction to steer Britain clear of recession. \"The greatest risk to the economy at the moment is losing momentum,\" said Ian Fletcher, the BCC's chief economist."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
