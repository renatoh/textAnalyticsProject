A London-based criminal lawyer who was the youth justice practitioner on the Law Society criminal law committee until last year said violence was breaking out in magistrates courts after 15 of 33 in the capital had been closed since 2010. \u201cAcross Lambeth, Greenwich, Lewisham and Southwark, where 1.2 million people live, there\u2019s not a youth court. That is just appalling,\u201d Greg Stewart said. \u201cAll of those kids now go to Bromley, where there are wars breaking out with gangs of kids showing up and being dealt with from boroughs all across south London. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be there. They should be in local courts, with local practitioners, with their parents able to afford to go with them.\u201d He said an experienced security guard at Bromley youth court was being moved to another job because he was \u201cfed up of pulling kids apart who were trying to fight each other in waiting rooms\u201d. Stewart also said the remaining youth courts in London were sitting until 7pm on some days because the caseload was so high. \u201cThese closures are starting to bite the Ministry of Justice back,\u201d he said. Some defendants say they are now too scared to attend court, or have been attacked on arrival. Charlie Taylor, the head of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, said he had concerns about \u201cpostcode issues\u201d arising when members of rival London gangs ended up in the same court. Taylor said courts were doing their best to mitigate issues, citing the example of Highbury Corner youth court, which now serves six boroughs. \u201cThey try to do an Islington day and a Hackney day or whatever,\u201d he said, but \u201cthere is a risk that if someone has been in the cells and they are bailed and there is beef between those groups then it could be an issue. \u201cTouch wood there hasn\u2019t been anything serious I have heard of but it\u2019s something to watch out for.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
