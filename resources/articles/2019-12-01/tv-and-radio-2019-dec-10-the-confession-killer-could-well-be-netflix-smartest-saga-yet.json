But now that we\u2019re swamped with endless films and podcasts and series about people who kill people, or people who got away with killing people, or people who were convicted of killing people they didn\u2019t actually kill, it\u2019s hard not to feel a little queasy. These are horrible, terrible acts of violence, and they\u2019re also the source of a seemingly neverending stream of mass entertainment. The newest, thoroughly grisly addition to the fold is The Confession Killer. A five-part documentary that recounts the story of Henry Lee Lucas, it is currently among Netflix\u2019s top 10 most-watched shows in the UK. This won\u2019t count as a spoiler if you haven\u2019t seen it \u2013 after all, it\u2019s called The Confession Killer \u2013 but Lucas is famous for being the man who claimed responsibility for hundreds of murders. In 1983 and 1984, Lucas\u2019s apparently unstoppable urge for killing helped a taskforce of Texas rangers clear 213 unsolved cases from its books. It didn\u2019t matter that the victims, methods and weapons appeared to be chosen at random, nor that actual tangible evidence was scarce. Lucas had confessed, and that was enough. As such, The Confession Killer is less of a whodunnit and more of a \u2018hedunnit?!\u2019 It is, in every way, a classic Netflix true crime documentary. Structurally, it could have been created by an algorithm. The visuals are all grainy archive footage mixed with new interviews. There are clips of sensationalist old documentaries about Lucas that drip with cartoon blood. The theme tune is a wobbly video nasty number. It\u2019s much longer than it needs to be, with three episodes of good material padded out to five. If you saw Making a Murderer, or The Confession Tapes, or The Keepers, you could quite easily sleepwalk through all the major beats of this. Crucially, it also offers up no new information. That\u2019s because Lucas isn\u2019t some obscure little serial killer \u2013 he\u2019s one of the most infamous criminals in US history, whose death sentence was pardoned by George W Bush. Several films have been made about his life. One of them \u2013 Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer \u2013 is so notorious that it took 17 years to be released uncut in the UK. The Confession Killer is in many ways the ultimate boilerplate true crime documentary, dredging up a case that\u2019s already been dredged up countless times. However, there is a different way to read it, and it makes the whole thing more palatable. Perhaps \u2013 just perhaps \u2013 it\u2019s a comment on us, and our unquenchable thirst for murder. Looking back, it\u2019s clear that Lucas was more than just a potential killer \u2013 he was fascinated by death, and had a willingness to be whatever people wanted him to be. To the police, he was a bucket in which to throw all their unsolved crimes, with Lucas often appearing to cold-read investigators like a seaside clairvoyant until he\u2019d gained enough details of each murder to suitably pass himself off as the killer. He became a media sensation thanks to his happiness to fit into the profile of a serial killer. The term was still new and sexy in the early 80s, and the public was desperate to cram anyone they could into a mould they were yet to fully understand. And now he\u2019s back again, right as the true crime documentary epidemic is at its peak. We\u2019ve become a planet of armchair investigators, doling out sentences left and right between mouthfuls of crisps, based on nothing but what the television tells us about a case. We cannot get enough of murder shows. We want more of them, all the time, no matter what. Like the police who took Lucas\u2019 word that he had killed 600 people, we\u2019ll lap anything up. If The Confession Killer was simply intended to be a series about Lucas \u2013 a man who has already had more screentime than many other serial killers put together \u2013 it\u2019s a mediocre one at best. But if it\u2019s actually a sly jab at us and our obsession with reheating gruesome deaths, then perhaps it\u2019s Netflix\u2019s smartest true crime saga of them all.
