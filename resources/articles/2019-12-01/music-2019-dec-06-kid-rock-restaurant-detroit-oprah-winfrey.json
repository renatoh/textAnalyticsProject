The billionaire Ilitch family that owns the arena in which the restaurant is housed announced on Wednesday that Kid Rock had \u201cvoluntarily decided not to renew\u201d his licensing agreement for Kid Rock\u2019s Made in Detroit. The eatery, which served new American bar food with a southern flare, opened in 2017. Kid Rock confirmed the news on his Facebook page, but he wasn\u2019t done there. \u201cI appreciate all who have patronized our place and still have much love for the City of Detroit and the people / organizations that I have helped there for years, black, white, whatever, but learned long ago, go where you\u2019re celebrated, not tolerated,\u201d he added. \u201cI guess the millions of dollars I pumped into that town was not enough.\u201d Since the announcement, Kid Rock has attacked local and national civil rights figures such as the Rev Al Sharpton. In response, Detroit civil rights leaders at a Wednesday press conference said: \u201cGood riddance.\u201d \u201cThank you, and see you later, Kid Rock. We don\u2019t need hatemongering racists in our city,\u201d said the Rev Charles Williams II, director of the Detroit National Action Network chapter. The controversy also appears to mark a break for the musician with Detroit, the city where Kid Rock made his name with his brash style of music that meshes rap, southern rock and country. Despite his ties to the region and incorporation of the city\u2019s image into his act, Kid Rock has remained a polarising figure locally, and largely now resides in Nashville. He ignited the firestorm on 28 November while making what many viewed as racist and lewd comments about Winfrey and Joy Behar, co-host of the ABC daytime talk show The View, on stage at his Big Ass Honky Tonk &amp; Rock N\u2019 Roll Steakhouse in Nashville. \u201cOprah Winfrey is like, \u2018Hey, I want to get some white women to believe in this shit.\u2019 Fuck her,\u201d a visibly unsteady Kid Rock declared during the rant. \u201cShe can suck dick sideways \u2026 And if you say that, you\u2019re like, \u2018Hey, well I\u2019m pretty sure Kid Rock is a racist,\u2019 I\u2019m like, OK, fine.\u201d The following day, he offered an apparent explanation on Twitter: \u201cMy people tried to get me to do The Oprah Winfrey Show years ago and her people wanted me to write down five reasons why I loved her and her show. I said fuck that and her. End of story.\u201d The tweet included a LGBTQ+ pride flag emoji. Local civil rights leaders in response planned a Wednesday protest for outside Made in Detroit, but the Ilitches made the announcement before it happened. Kid Rock didn\u2019t manage the restaurant, but licensed his name and image rights, and helped design the menu and interior. Kid Rock conceded to being a \u201cloudmouth jerk at times\u201d but said that \u201ctrying to label me racist is a joke, and actually only does a disservice to the black community\u201d. In his Facebook post Kid Rock also included one last jab at civil rights leaders: \u201cHey Al Sharpton, you or your cronies will never beat me you tax evading, race baiting clown! Trump 2020!!\u201d Civil rights leaders are calling for the Ilitch family to replace Made in Detroit with a black-owned restaurant. They note that the city is about 80% black and its residents gave the Ilitches more than $320m in direct tax money to build the arena."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
