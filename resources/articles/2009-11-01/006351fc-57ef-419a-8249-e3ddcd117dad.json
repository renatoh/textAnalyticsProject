Just very agreeable", "bodyText": "By midday, an air of somnolence had already settled over the first day of Sir John Chilcot's inquiry into the Iraq war, and the public seats were empty of all but a scattering of people. Perhaps it was Sir John's stern admonition that he and his colleagues did not wish to be distracted from their task by disturbances. More likely, the spectacle of three grey-suited Whitehall warriors being gently questioned by a panel consisting of four knights and a baroness did not inspire the expectation of excitement. After all the sound and fury of the war and its aftermath, even the surroundings of the inquiry, at the Queen Elizabeth conference centre opposite Westminster Abbey, seemed conducive to a lowering of the temperature. No more millions marching; it has come to this at last: a desiccated, serious discussion that may possibly produce a verdict, but not the cartharsis of a finding of guilt or innocence. \"No one is on trial here,\" Chilcot announced. \"But I make a commitment that once we get to our final report, we will not shy away from making criticisms, either of institutions, processes or individuals, where they are warranted.\" To that end, the hearings are being held in a space the size of a classroom, decorated in subdued greys and blues. Blinds cover the windows so no outside light seeps in and large air-conditioning pipes snake across the ceiling. If you can have a bunker on the second floor of a building, this is it. The gentility of the first morning's hearing resembled an agreeable post-prandial chat in the senior common room and the murmuring of the witnesses was so quiet that the stenographer, sitting only feet away, was reduced to dotting the word \"inaudible\" repeatedly across the transcript that flickered silently across a screen in the corner. Later when Sir Roderic Lyne, one of the inquiry team, asked what Russia's position had been on Iraq, Sir William Patey, former head of the Foreign Office's Middle East department, now our ambassador to Saudi Arabia, courteously replied: \"You probably know more about Russia's position than I do, as you were ambassador there at the time.\" There were many questions demanding, in the manner of a Latin textbook, the answer yes. The latest of the series of inquiries into the government's conduct of the Iraq war began with a few moments' silence in memory of the dead of both Britain and Iraq and then an insistence by Chilcot that the inquiry, scheduled to report by the end of next year, will be independent and apolitical. He said: \"What we are committed to and what the British public can expect from us is a guarantee to be thorough, impartial, objective and fair.\" He and his colleagues will hold hearings until February, then retreat to examine documents during the general election, before resuming next summer. Tony Blair is expected to give evidence in the new year and Gordon Brown's spokesman confirmed that the prime minister would be happy to appear, if called. Today'shearing began with that distant, pre-lapsarian period in 2001, before the twin towers attack, a time, the mandarins assured the inquiry, when Iraq was but one of several foreign affairs problems and Britain relied for intelligence on a chap from the Ankara embassy asking the Kurds what was happening there. The Foreign Office had thought a tightening of UN sanctions would bring Saddam Hussein into line and, although some in the new Bush administration were speaking of regime change, such a scheme was dismissed in a brief Foreign Office paper as having no legal basis. \"In February 2001 we were aware of these drum beats from Washington and internally we discussed it. Our policy was to stay away from that. We didn't think Saddam was a good thing and it would be great if he went, but we didn't have an explicit policy for trying to get rid of him,\" Sir William explained urbanely. Outside by lunchtime two demonstrators were still braving the cold, heated only by their continuing fury. One carried a placard reading: \"7 million Iraqis killed, wounded, homeless since 2003\" \u2013 although even that was moderated by the Santa hat he was wearing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
