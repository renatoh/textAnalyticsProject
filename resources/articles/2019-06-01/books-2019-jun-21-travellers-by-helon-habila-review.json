This is the answer to the question of what contemporary fiction can do, and the reason I laugh whenever people say (as a character declares ironically in Travellers) that the novel is dead. Originally from Nigeria, Habila lives and teaches in the US. Back in the academic year of 2013-2014, though, he was in Berlin on a fellowship, and it is in this city that Travellers begins. The novel is divided into six sections. In One Year in Berlin, a nameless Nigerian academic, the principal narrator, falls in with protesters \u2013 who are \u201cprotesting everything\u201d \u2013 and in particular with Mark from Malawi, who turns out to have had a previous identity; he is now \u201cout-of-status\u201d and therefore deportable. He also meets a Libyan doctor, Manu, now working as a bouncer, who lost his wife and child in a boat that sank at sea. Each Sunday, Manu looks for them at Checkpoint Charlie \u2013 the title of section two. Portia, a young Zambian student, is the daughter of a dissident poet in exile in London. She sets off to Basel (the title of section three) with the narrator to interview the woman who married and then killed her brother. In The Interpreters, Karim tells the narrator the story of his flight through Yemen, Syria and Turkey and his year in a Bulgarian jail trying to protect his sons. In The Sea, a woman who has lost her memory languishes in southern Italy and marries again \u2013 only to remember the husband she already has. When the narrator comes to London with Portia, they chance upon Juma, an asylum seeker hiding from immigration officials in a neighbouring flat. His whereabouts have recently been made public and now there are two sets of protesters outside \u2013 those trying to prevent his arrest and those demanding it. Juma himself is fasting, also out of protest; this is the sixth story, Hunger. I\u2019ve read fine journalism that reports on asylum seekers, the refugee camps of Europe and the journeys across Africa and the Mediterranean \u2013 but this novel\u2019s great achievement is to make you feel it, smell it, live it. You\u2019re in the sea \u2013 drowning, panicking, lost, \u201cpeople clawing their way up to the deck, kicking and screaming and holding on to their children\u2019s hands\u201d. You\u2019re in the camps on an Italian island where refugees have \u201crotting feet in their wet shoes \u2026 [and are] delirious with fright from being between dead bodies in the boat\u201d. In London, you are jostled as you pass through the \u201cnativist\u201d protesters while a bus with \u201cforeigners out\u201d written on the side circles \u201cround and round, slowly, like a shark circling a drowning swimmer\u201d. You feel acutely the hostility of the \u201chostile environment\u201d that is the Home Office\u2019s cruel and inhumane immigration policy. Travellers is also replete with literary references that twist and gleam through the narrative, adding light and riches and setting off unexpected resonances. There is Flaubert\u2019s image of the \u201criver of shit relentlessly washing away at the foundations of every ivory tower ever built\u201d, and Dostoevsky on love; Milton\u2019s drowned Lycidas, Matthew Arnold and John Donne; TS Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land and The Leopard by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa. Shakespeare is everywhere. As Habila reinterprets Europe, so too with European literature; you read it, experience it, feel it anew. Arnold\u2019s \u201cDover Beach\u201d, for example, is invoked from the perspective of a refugee in the Jungle at Calais: looking at the French shore, Juma\u2019s friend comments that \u201cArnold says something about the \u2018eternal note of sadness\u2019\u201d. And Juma replies: \u201cI know what that means.\u201d And this is the novel\u2019s greatest triumph \u2013 to conjure in the reader the seemingly irreconcilable feelings of both intense revivification and displacement. By the end, you feel as though you, too, are seeing what Europe means afresh: its racism, its confusion, its attraction, its incoherence, its safeties. But you are also full of stories of African conflict, dispossession and human suffering. Again and again, Habila asks the deepest questions about the relationship of Europe to Africa and Africa to Europe. And with great skill, he makes the unfamiliar familiar and vice versa.
