The rhythms were unpredictable, the mood cuddly but confusing. Ironically for a remix effort, this album shifts the focus away from the band's adventurous nature and focuses on their strengths. Neverevereverdid sheds its pots and pans orchestra and reveals its impressive rock backbone. The pop sundae of sounds in It's 5 melts away to one shrieking sentiment and becomes a dance anthem. Not everything works, with the instrumental Rendezvous: Potrero Hill, a brief breathing space on In Case We Die, here stretched to breaking point, and if you didn't fall for the kitschy charm of the original album, you're unlikely to now. But Architecture in Helsinki's mischievous freedom infects these respectful reworkings and the tunes, no longer blurred and buried, shine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
