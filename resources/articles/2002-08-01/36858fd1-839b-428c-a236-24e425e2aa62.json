To the alarm of some, call centre employment is tailing off because of cuts and, more significantly, movement offshore. HSBC chief executive Sir Keith Whitson caused a stir by suggesting the bank's Asian call-centre agents were more motivated and harder working than the British, not to mention 80 per cent cheaper. But that's the tip of the iceberg. A slew of multinationals, including GE, ABN-Amro, British Airways and Zurich Insurance have moved their call centres eastwards in what is forecast to become a stampede. McKinsey, the consultant, expects India alone to account for $4 billion in offshore call centre services by 2008, with the overall market growing by 50 per cent a year. Nobody wants to see good UK jobs disappear. But most jobs in call centres are as vulnerable as poorly paid posts in manufacturing. Indeed, with its compartmentalisation, over-reliance on technology and tight controls, the average call centre often mimics the features and faults of mass production manufacturing in the 1970s. That's why it more often damages customer service than improves it and also why it is an unsatisfactory place to work. Such jobs are destined to migrate overseas, like their counterparts in textiles or assembly. That's not to say it's impossible for call centres to be great employers or contribute to successful businesses. But in that case there would be no reason to outsource them, still less to India. The irony is that, for the majority of companies, placing call centres offshore simply distances the issues and makes them harder to address. To understand why, look no further than BBC2's riveting recent fly-on-the-wall series, The Secret Life of the Office. Holiday Autos is no better and no worse than many other call centres. But like them it does nothing to solve the business's underlying problems. In fact it institutionalises them. While the bosses upstairs are congratulating themselves on running an open and effective ship, downstairs a demoralised workforce is complaining of impossible targets and picking the moment to leave. This is not primarily a matter of communication. The way most call centres are set up actually prevents the company from improving. This is because, instead of being tightly integrated into the whole system, they exist as stand-alone office factories, insulated from other departments and driven by internal metrics (typically calls per hour or minute) that have nothing to do with value to the customer and everything to do with managing cost. They seem to have learned nothing from the lean manufacturing movement of the last 15 years. Based on harnessing customer value to the principle of flow - pulling work just-in-time through simple, tightly coupled processes without stopping - lean manufacturing progressively exposes problems and directs attention to them. This triggers a cycle of continuous improvement in quality, cost, reliability and hence also (gulp) customer satisfaction that, if emulated everywhere, would wipe out the UK's productivity gap overnight. In Holiday Autos, however, it's impossible to tell what are the real problems - except that they are to do with the system, not the people. Unquantifiable (but always large) amounts of effort are wasted, adding cost without value. Work is about forcing the numbers to come out right rather than tweaking the system and eliminating waste. Now look what happens when, in addition, call centres are outsourced, as a growing number are, to 'facilities management' outfits such as EDS, Accenture and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Outsourcing is mass-production, batch-based thinking par excellence. The assumptions are that the best way to deal with problems is to hand them to someone else with the specialisation and economies of scale to solve them at lower cost. Sounds plausible. But the assumptions are false. The argument of economies of scale and specialisation is self-serving, benefiting providers, not purchasers. Having relieved a company of a specialisation - never to be regained - like any monopolist, the outsourcing firm can drive an ever-harder bargain. This helps explain Whitehall's chronic difficulties in managing computer contracts. In the 1960s the civil service was a centre of IT expertise. Having outsourced that capability to computer and outsourcing firms, it has locked itself into a cycle of dependency that would bring tears of admiration to the eyes of a heroin dealer . Moreover, like any company in the same position, Whitehall is up against contract negotiators who are more skilled and street-wise than it is. Not surprisingly, the negotiator's skill is deployed to protect the profit margins of the contractor, not the interests of the end customer - whether rail passenger, Government department or the Child Support Agency, as in the latest computer shambles. In the case of call centres, outsourcing contracts are typically negotiated around cost, eg cost per call. But such a deal gives the provider no incentive to try to improve the business by getting rid of the problem - an inaccurate bill or poor service - that may have prompted the call in the first place. Remember who sells call centres - IT companies and other parties that are looking at increasing income streams over a period, not diminishing or abolishing them. As before, the call centre decouples cause from effect, disguising the business issues behind expensive IT and a barrage of spurious service numbers. Outsourcing it to a third party adds another screen. Sending it to India or China makes it impenetrable. Setting up a call centre and outsourcing it, then, is anything but the simple business solution it sounds. Where's your differentiation if you outsource a key function to a provider who can sell it to anyone else? How can you improve if they have your processes in what is politely called a stranglehold? Tellingly, both call centres and outsourcing are much less popular in continental Europe. Perhaps they know, as lean manufacturers do, that you solve problems by embracing, not exporting, them. On the other hand, if a job's not worth doing well, then don't do it at all - whether in Bangalore or Milford Haven. simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
