As the African lion is not currently listed as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act, it is legal to import lion trophies into the US. The US Fish and Wildlife service proposed listing African lions as threatened under the act last October. Additionally, the service proposed a rule under section 4(d) of the act, which, if passed, \u201cwill establish a permitting mechanism for the importation of sport-hunted lion trophies, provided that the lions originate from countries with a scientifically sound management plan for African lions\u201d, according to a 2014 release from the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The service said sport hunting was not found to be a threat at the time. Kathleen Garrigan, spokesperson for the conservation group African Wildlife Foundation, said listing the African lion as threatened would not result in \u201ca blanket ban\u201d on importing hunting trophies. African lions have largely declined in population across the continent, mostly because of habitat loss and conflict with humans. Garrigan said that often, lions kill livestock and local communities retaliate by killing the lion or its pride. \u201cAdding any more human-induced mortality, through sport hunting \u2013 we oppose that,\u201d Garrigan said. Globally, the African lion is listed as vulnerable, with rapid population declines in both western and eastern Africa. National animal advocacy non-profit Born Free USA joined a coalition of several organizations petitioning the US Fish and Wildlife Service to list the African lion as threatened. In light of Cecil\u2019s killing, Kate Dylewsky, a program associate with Born Free USA, said the group was waiting to hear whether the African lion would be listed as threatened under the act. A statement on Born Free USA\u2019s website urged citizens to write the US Fish and Wildlife Service and urge it issue a final rule listing the lion as threatened. Dylewsky said listing the African lion as endangered or threatened would not affect US citizens who want to go to other countries and hunt. However, hunters usually have to pay tens of thousands of dollars to make these trips, and a ban on bringing home trophies might deter them. Garrigan said that while the most success will come from listing the African lion as threatened under the act, private companies \u2013 especially airlines \u2013 could do their part to curb importing hunting trophies. Earlier this year, Emirates Airlines stopped carrying hunting trophies of elephants, rhinos, lions and tigers on its planes. South African Airways, which previously banned customers from transporting hunting trophies, lifted the embargo on 22 July. \u201cFor many, it\u2019s not worth it because they want to bring home the trophy,\u201d Garrigan said. \u201cThe government could take matters into their own hands, but companies have a role to play. If they\u2019re ethically opposed to transporting trophies, they can make a corporate stance against it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
