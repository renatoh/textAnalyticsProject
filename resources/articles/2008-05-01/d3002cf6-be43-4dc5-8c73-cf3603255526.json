It takes its current name from the Moscow district. What's it like? From the outside it is reminiscent of Brighton's Royal Pavilion, minus the domes. From the inside an uninspiring bowl with an athletics track. Clashing yellow, orange and red seats further mar the aesthetic. Home to Spartak Moscow and Torpedo Moscow. Spartak - nicknamed \"Meat\" as they used to be owned by the Soviet collective farms - play in the Russian Premier League and include the Croatia goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa and a Brazilian called Mozart in their squad. Torpedo used to be good but are no longer. In the 1950s and 60s Eduard Streltsov - the \"Russian Pele\" - played for them. Now they are in the second tier of Russian football. The pitch Normally a plastic affair, as Steve McClaren could tell you after his England side lost their European Championship qualifier 2-1 there last year. There will, however, be a turf pitch specially laid for the Champions League final. The current turf has been imported at short notice from Slovakia after the first attempt failed to take root and rumours last week suggested the new effort is little better. Sporting history The stadium was the centrepiece of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, when the capacity was 104,000, hosting the classic 800m and 1500m battles between Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett, Allan Wells' victory in the 100m and Daley Thompson's gold medal decathlon performance. Extra-curricular activities The stadium has hosted rock concerts most notably the 1989 Moscow Peace Festival featuring heroes of the mosh pit such as Bon Jovi, Ozzy Osbourne and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. The Luzhniki Disaster On October 20, 1982 spectators were trampled to death during a Uefa Cup match between Spartak and the Dutch club Haarlem. The official death toll was 66 but other estimates put the figure at 340. How they see us \"Maybe the final can help unfreeze diplomatic relations between our two countries,\" said Alexei Sorokin, the official in charge of preparations. \"What should we be doing now? Congratulating ourselves on having 42,000 Brits coming to town or start regretting it?\" asked the paper Sport Express."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
