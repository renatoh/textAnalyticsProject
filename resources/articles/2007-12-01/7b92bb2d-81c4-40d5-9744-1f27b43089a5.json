As Ashton strolled through the first half to the derision of Middlesbrough supporters, there was a powerful case for West Ham to come to his mercy and dress slim in an emergency switch to claret and blue stripes. And they would have been wise to remove the XL sponsors' logo while they were at it. Then the joking stopped. With half-time imminent, Lucas Neill lobbed a hopeful ball forward, Henri Camara let it run loose and Ashton cracked in an equaliser from 20 yards. The outsize striker had gained a clinical revenge. He had even walked very slowly from an offside position to do it. Total calories expended: about 2\u00bd. Total Middlesbrough fans silenced: about 24,000. \"That's what I'm about,\" said Ashton. \"Sharpness is not just about running. You can run all day and get nowhere. If I'm scoring goals, everyone says I'm fit; if I'm not scoring goals, then I'm unfit. Hopefully this can now be put to bed.\" Ashton deserves patience as he gradually fights back from a prolonged absence with a serious ankle injury. \"I've got to get games under my belt,\" the former Norwich City player said. He could find a better place to keep them. A desultory match ended with a West Ham winner in the last minute of normal time. Scott Parker was heavily involved in an intricate exchange of passes, which finished with him skipping aside David Wheater, who had misguidedly tried to play offside, and shooting past Mark Schwarzer. Middlesbrough fans skulked out, peeved that their side had lain dormant after Wheater had given them a 40th-minute lead, stabbing the ball home after Stuart Downing's excellent free-kick enabled J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re - the only footballer whose name sounds like a football chant - to escape Jonathan Spector beyond the far post. On the whistle West Ham players stripped off their shirts and threw them into the crowd; Ashton sensibly kept his vest on. A local radio commentator scoffed that he was carrying \"a lot of timber\" but it was Middlesbrough who had been felled. There was little else to admire. Adam Johnson linked well in the first half with Emanuel Pogatetz down Boro's left but then switched flanks and the relationship was lost. Nolberto Solano curled a classy free-kick over the Boro wall in the second half but was thwarted by a fine save from Schwarzer. But the memory that lingered was a dreadfully weak piece of refereeing when Mike Atkinson booked Solano for rightly protesting at a free-kick that Middlesbrough had not retreated 10 yards. Solano had wanted to try something imaginative, which would have cheered everyone up, but was denied his right. Instead he was booked and then hoofed the ball high over the bar in desperation. That summed it up really. Man of the match Nolberto Solano (West Ham United)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
