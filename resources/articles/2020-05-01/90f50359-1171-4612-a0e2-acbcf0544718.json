It was the eve of the New Hampshire primary, an election that could bring the charismatic Arkansas governor closer to his lifelong dream of becoming president of the United States. But allegations of an affair with country music singer Gennifer Flowers were about to derail months of good work on the campaign trail. When the interviewer refers to their marriage as an \u201carrangement\u201d, Bill clasps Hillary\u2019s hands and says, blue eyes tearing up: \u201cWait a minute, wait a minute - you\u2019re looking at two people who love each other.\u201d Then Hillary gives a response that would shape the public story of their coupledom. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette,\u201d she says, pumping her fist emphatically. \u201cI\u2019m sitting here because I love him, and I respect him, and I honour what he\u2019s been through and what we\u2019ve been through together. And you know, if that\u2019s not enough for people, then heck - don\u2019t vote for him.\u201d This scene is one of the many pieces of footage - some of it never seen before - that the filmmakers weave together in the course of The Clinton Affair. It gives us a glimpse of the private story of the Clintons, the union of a pair of equals who met and fell in love in the library at Yale Law School, each emboldened by the other\u2019s ambitions, politics and intellect. It\u2019s a narrative that\u2019s reinforced in Hillary, a much-anticipated new docuseries coming to SBS and SBS On Demand later this year, which traces the arc of Hillary\u2019s political trajectory from her feminist awakening in the late 1960s to her 2016 presidential campaign. But The Clinton Affair also shows us how the private story of the Clintons\u2019 marriage would go on to shape a public narrative about a lack of faith in government and institutions, and the inability of American political dynasties - with their links to corporate interests - to understand the plight of everyday people. These ideas swirl around in today\u2019s culture, fragmenting votes around a range of interests and causes and widening the ideological divide. Hillary, however, depicts the ways in which Hillary\u2019s legacy has always been shaped by the ways in which she was forced, as a young female lawyer, to withhold her emotions to demonstrate her credibility. The docuseries also show how the scandals that rocked the Clinton administration led Hillary to further strengthen her defences to avoid public scrutiny. The gendered double standard that dictates female politicians must be \u201clikeable\u201d, and able to freely show their emotions, would undercut her political achievements even as she became a global feminist icon. It would contribute to her 2016 election loss to Donald Trump, despite winning the popular vote. The Clintons have played such a powerful role in modern history that it\u2019s easy to overlook their influence as a cultural barometer. But, as Amanda Hess puts it in a November 2018 New York Times article, The Clinton Affair takes a largely neutral stance, recounting the events of the 1990s in chronological order. In doing so, it shows us, for the first time, how the Clintons themselves were caught up in cultural change. The Clinton Affair introduces Hillary as a new kind of first lady. She isn\u2019t an ornament to be looked at. She\u2019s a formidable lawyer who sits near her husband, her closest collaborator, in the West Wing. When Bill is inaugurated, she\u2019s chosen to chair the Task Force on National Health Care Reform, an attempt at more inclusive healthcare policy that still haunts pandemic-era America. But revelations that Bill was involved in a two-year sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a bright 22-year-old White House intern, and the string of events that would lead to his 1998 impeachment, shattered national perceptions of the Clintons as a couple whose relationship was rooted in shared ideals. At the time, the tabloids framed this as \u201cthe Lewinsky scandal\u201d. Invoking age-old gendered tropes, they cast Bill as the philandering husband, Hillary as the long-suffering wife and Lewinsky as young seductress. But Lewinsky gives in-depth accounts of her version of events and its painful implications for her life and family, and by putting her front and centre, The Clinton Affair exposes the invisible misogyny at work during that cultural moment. The documentary makes clear how the scandal was exacerbated by a newly potent 24-7 news cycle interested in bankable stories and easy targets. Most importantly, The Clinton Affair asks us to reconsider Lewinsky\u2019s testimony, and the part she played in history, from the position of a post-#MeToo era, one in which powerful men like Harvey Weinstein are held accountable for exploiting young women. Just as The Clinton Affair reclaims Lewinsky\u2019s perspective, Hillary wrests back Hillary\u2019s story by illuminating the ways in which her own chances at the presidency were compromised by the failures of the men around her. Hillary reveals how leaked sexts sent by Anthony Weiner, the husband of her top aide, Huma Abedin, sparked James Comey\u2019s new investigation into her use of a private email server, fuelling rumours about her trustworthiness that had lingered since her husband was in office. In doing so, Hillary sheds new light on the age-old feminist struggle that demands women must be perfect to be taken seriously. Almost three decades on, the Clintons\u2019 60 Minutes interview is a powerful testament of the their legacy. It raises questions that still loom large in our culture, about the role of good wives and good husbands, about whether feminism can truly elevate all women, about whether lapses in moral judgment compromise the ability to lead. But it also shows us that it\u2019s impossible to reduce people to ciphers and that even events that have become symbolic are a consequence of specific moments in time. Since we were first introduced to the Clintons, the world has changed in ways we could never imagine. When Hillary was asked, on an October 2019 ABC interview, to name the gutsiest thing she\u2019d ever done, she replied, \u201cmake the decision to stay in my marriage\u201d. Was she right? Only history will tell.
