I must admit to reservations: after all, Oxford and Cambridge are two of the top 10 universities in the world and there is not a shred of evidence that either has had any leadership for the past 900 years. Many years ago, I went on a course designed to teach \"vision\" and \"strategy\". I found it less of an educational experience and more like a revivalist meeting. When asked what mission statement I would impose on the university, I replied that my mission was to ensure the university never had a mission statement. I said that I found mission statements rather trite and superficial declarations of the blindingly obvious that did nothing for institutions as diverse as universities except to further enhance the healthy cynicism of the staff. I failed that module. There are a few good ideas in these courses if you look hard enough. One year, I got quite keen on the idea of \"key performance indicators\". These are supposed to be simple, clear, straightforward figures that give a concise measure of how well the university is doing. Now, what do I need to know? How many students there are in the university would be a good start. Are there more or less than last year? How do I find out? Ask the registrar. \"Why do you want to know?\" the registrar replies, unhelpfully. \"Well, according to my recent management course, this is a key performance indicator. Surely we know how many students we have?\" \"Yes, of course. I can tell you the figure exactly at the census date.\" \"Thank you. And when will that be?\" \"December.\" \"But it's only March now. I want to know today.\" The registrar gives me a look of despair. \"Do you want late entrants included? Do you want HE students only? Shall I exclude those students who are only registered while writing up their projects? What about students at partner colleges? Students on validated courses?\" I lose the will and retreat in confusion. So, how do I find out whether the university has more students this year than last? I could ask the deans but each one will assure me with complete conviction that they have exactly the right number of students. Deans are programmed at birth to make that statement. The solution is not a technique you will be taught on any management course. Just put three simple questions to the head of catering: what was the cash take last week in the refectory? How much cash did we take in the same week last year? By how much have you increased the price of sausages this year? The answers come back within an hour and, provided you know how many students there were last year, you can work out the new student number. Just multiply the increase in the weekly take and discount the increase in the price of food. Bingo! Instant student numbers, accurate to 1%. The calculation went wrong one year when I forgot that we had moved the engineers to a new campus and brought over the faculty of education. A healthy lunch for an engineer still seems to be a chip butty with a side order of chips, while the largely female education students go for the cheaper option of a small lettuce leaf with no mayonnaise. As a result, my method showed our student numbers in meltdown. So, always remember, if you want to know how many students there are, ask the head of catering. Now, where can I get a good cup of coffee? Should I see the head of catering? Don't be silly. I'm off to ask the registrar. \u00b7 Dr Peter Knight is vice-chancellor of UCE Birmingham (which has 24,342 students)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
