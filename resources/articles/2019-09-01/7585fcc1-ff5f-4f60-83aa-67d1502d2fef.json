Announcing the winner, judge Annie Mac said the album \u201cshowed remarkable levels of musicianship, true artistry, courage, honesty. And it is simply exceptional.\u201d Dave hugged his mother before walking on stage to collect the award. Wearing a neon tracksuit, he covered his mouth with his hand and looked shocked. He told the room that he was lost for words and invited his mother up to stand next to him. He thanked the \u201cexceptional musicians\u201d who performed alongside him tonight, namechecking fellow nominees Little Simz, Slowthai and Nao. He continued by paying tribute to his brother Christopher, who is serving a life sentence for his involvement in the killing of Sofyen Belamouadden: \u201cThis is your story, and even though you can\u2019t be here, I know you\u2019re watching this bro, and I\u2019m so grateful, thank you so much.\u201d Speaking after the ceremony, he added: \u201cThis is surreal. It is a massive honour and I am glad that I\u2019ve been able to repay the faith that a lot of people have put in me \u2026 I have good days and bad days, but you see the team around me, my friends, my family, they kept me strong through this process.\u201d Dave was presented with the \u00a325,000 prize at the Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith, London. His album Psychodrama is framed as a therapy session, and covers his brother\u2019s incarceration, prison reform and the diversity of the black experience. Psychodrama was one of a number of nominated albums that commented on life as a young black Briton today, alongside Slowthai\u2019s Nothing Great About Britain and Little Simz\u2019s Grey Area. Speaking before the ceremony, Little Simz said she thought there was still \u201ca ways to go\u201d before their messages reached the mainstream. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re getting there,\u201d she said. \u201cEven outside of music, like [TV series] Top Boy, that represents something that is bigger than ourselves and that will hopefully ignite change and make people really aware of and understand issues in gang culture and London. I feel like everyone\u2019s on the same mission.\u201d Slowthai was the bookmakers\u2019 favourite to win the prize, with odds of 9/4 in the hours leading up to the ceremony. He was followed by Idles and Dave (both at 4/1). The 28th edition of the award was hailed by critics as its most political in years. \u201cIt\u2019s never seemed quite so engaged with and informed by current events,\u201d wrote Guardian music critic Alexis Petridis when the shortlist was announced in July. Slowthai performed wearing a T-shirt that read \u201cFuck Boris\u201d, spelled out in letters made up of illustrations of the prime minister\u2019s naked body. He repeated the phrase throughout his performance, which ended with him pulling a rubber model of Johnson\u2019s decapitated head out of a rucksack and shouting: \u201cFuck Boris Johnson, fuck everything, and there\u2019s nothing great about Britain.\u201d By the end of his performance, the T-shirt design was available to buy through his website. Nominee Yannis Philippakis, of Oxford band Foals, told the Guardian on the red carpet: \u201cThere\u2019s a genuine thrust of more political music as a response to the current climate, whether it\u2019s to do with British social issues or more of a general feeling that we\u2019re entering into more of a dystopia.\u201d Cassie Kinoshi, of 10-piece jazz group Seed Ensemble, said that she hoped the group\u2019s debut album, Driftglass, highlighted the British political issues that she felt \u201cneeds to be continually discussed and highlighted. The track Wake is there to make sure that we continue to keep Grenfell at the forefront of people\u2019s minds. And the first track on there, The Darkies, is about what it means to exist as a black British person in society where you\u2019re treated as an other.\u201d \u201cI think there are lots of different types of politics in the shortlist,\u201d Jeff Smith told the Guardian earlier this week. The head of music for BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music has judged the awards for nine years. \u201cThere\u2019s the politics of austerity, climate change, urban decay, the politics of the heart and the mind. It\u2019s interesting to see how they reflect life for modern British people and the conditions they\u2019ve found themselves in over this last year.\u201d The prize is decided on the night by a panel of judges, which this year consisted of musicians Stormzy, Gaz Coombes of Supergrass, Jamie Cullum and Jorja Smith, broadcasters Annie Mac, Clara Amfo and Danielle Perry, radio directors Jeff Smith and Mike Walsh, and journalists Phil Alexander, Tshepo Mokoena and Will Hodgkinson. Music Week reported that the Mercury shortlist had resulted in the traditional sales spike for the nominated artists: Seed Ensemble saw the biggest increase in sales, with 85%, although their total number of albums sold is still under 1,000 copies. Black Midi saw 49% sales growth; Slowthai 31%, Cate Le Bon 28.7%, Little Simz and Fontaines DC 21%, Dave 14.5%, Foals 8.7%, Nao 8.2% and Idles 7.6%. The 1975\u2019s A Brief History Into Online Relationships is the list\u2019s biggest seller, at 148,000 to date. This year\u2019s full list of nominees was: Anna Calvi (for her album Hunter); Black Midi (Schlagenheim); Cate Le Bon (Reward); Dave (Psychodrama); Foals (Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Pt1); Fontaines DC (Dogrel); Idles (Joy As an Act of Resistance); Little Simz (Grey Area); Nao (Saturn); SEED Ensemble (Driftglass); Slowthai (Nothing Great About Britain); the 1975 (A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
