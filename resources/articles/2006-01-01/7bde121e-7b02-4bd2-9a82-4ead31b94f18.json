Or to be more precise he told Captain Alatriste. You may remember, Your Mercies, the two men were present on that same attack on the walls of Ostend some 20 years ago. Alatriste fingered his sword. \"Madrid has become too dangerous,\" he said. \"I'm thinking of returning to my old tercio.\" Your Mercies, please indulge me when I tell you that the Spain of Phillip IV had become a corrupt and immoral society, and that clipped, inconsequential dialogue had become the order of the day. Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted the great poet don Francisco de Quevedo, the equal to Cervantes. Little did I know how our lives would change. \"I have a favour to ask,\" said don Francisco. Alatriste, a man never given to many words, merely grunted. He could not refuse. While Alatriste was glum and terse Quevedo oft did speak in verse \"Go outside, \u00cd\u00f1igo,\" the Captain said to me, though I merely hid when don Francisco introduced an elderly man, Don Vicente de la Cruz, and his two sons. \"My daughter, Elvira, has been taken by a due\u00f1a and is being held in the convent of La Adoraci\u00f3n,\" he said, \"where Padre Coroado treats the novices as his seraglio. We cannot free her, though, for fear the Padre will expose our Jewish blood.\" Your Mercies, please forgive me when I say that the Church was most cruel and unholy at this time. Never trust a man who only reads one book. Alatriste stroked his melancholy moustache. \"There will be bloodshed.\" As we unlocked the convent's garden door, we were ambushed on all sides by armed men. Alatriste bade me flee while his sword ran red with rivers of blood. I hurried past the dying Don Vicente straight on to the blade of Alatriste's greatest enemy, Gualterio Malatesta. As events become more torrid So the rhyme becomes more florid \"It gives me little pleasure to hand you over to the Inquisition,\" said Malatesta. But turn me in, Your Mercies, he did. And though at 13 years old I was too young for the rack, I was whipped mercilessly, but I am proud to say that never once did I betray my master, Alatriste. \"Pardiez. We have been undone. Alqu\u00e9zar has used us to discredit the convent and to settle his account with me,\" growled Alatriste in the longest sentence he ever uttered. \"But we must save \u00cd\u00f1igo.\" I watched Elvira burn as I awaited my own sentence at the auto da f\u00e9. Your Mercies, I tell you that I never saw don Francisco approach Alqu\u00e9zar with a document in the royal box. We have the proof that you're a Jew Release the boy, or I'll run you through Neither did I see Alatriste draw his dagger in the plaza, leaving two henchmen to rot in hell, and Malatesta himself reeling from his wounds. Your Mercies, as I enjoyed my freedom, Alatriste hunted Malatesta to his rooms. \"Finish me off,\" Malatesta cried, as the Captain held a pistol to his head. But Alatriste just turned and laughed.
