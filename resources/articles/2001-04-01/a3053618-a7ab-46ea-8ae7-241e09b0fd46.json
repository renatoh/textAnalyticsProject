Any evidence that a combination of the two banks would decrease competition in the sector would be more likely to lead to an outright block on the merger rather than the suggestion of potential \"remedies\" such as selling branches, the commission's deputy chairman, Denise Kingsmill, said. Publishing a letter sent to the two protagonists yesterday, Ms Kingsmill said the 25 points raised were intended to form the basis of private discussion between them and the commission in the days shortly after the Easter break. Among the points raised was the question of whether the level of profitabilty of the \"leading suppliers of retail financial services in the UK point to there being a low level of competition in these markets, or some of them\". However, Ms Kingsmill said the commission was not trying to conclude whether Lloyds TSB made \"too much money\". The inquiry would analyse whether by taking over Abbey National - which had been trying to merge with Bank of Scotland before Lloyds' intervention - Lloyds would be able to increase its margins. Ms Kingsmill and her three colleagues will consider whether any particular importance should be attached to competition offered by Abbey National as it is not one of the \"big four\" banks. Ms Kingmill said that while a list of potential solutions to any evidence of anti-competition had been published yesterday, the most likely suggestion was to block the bid entirely."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
