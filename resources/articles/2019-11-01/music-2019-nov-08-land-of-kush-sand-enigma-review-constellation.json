Cleverly, however, he manages to glue these genres together in such a way that the final result doesn\u2019t resemble any of them. Born in Libya to Egyptian parents, Shalabi was five when his family moved to Canada and he has been a leading light in Montreal\u2019s alternative music scene since the 1980s, leading punk, electronica and bebop bands with names like Swamp Circuit, the Dwarfs of East Agouza, Nutsak, Moose Terrific and Detention. Land of Kush is his most ambitious project, featuring around 20 members in its various iterations. The last Land of Kush album came out in 2013, its heady optimism inspired by the Arab Spring, and Shalabi has spent much of the last six years living in Cairo. Sand Enigma seems to reflect the confusion and dislocation of latterday Egypt: a santur solo is interrupted by dramatic string stabs and arrhythmic baritone sax squalls; a cello freakout coalesces into a stately Arabic love song; an ecstatic free jazz duet for tenor sax and wordless vocals mutates into a delicate flamenco ballad. The best tracks unify these disparate sources. Recuerdo finds singer Katie Moore warbling over a harmonium drone and ends up sounding like Portishead\u2019s Beth Gibbons singing Egyptian classical music. On Ana, Sarah Pag\u00e9 plays a harp that appears to have been tuned in Arabic microtones. Tensor has Devin Brahja Waldman improvising on his alto sax as if replicating a muezzin\u2019s call to prayer. Trema has Egyptian singer Nadah El Shazly crooning gently over a galloping rhythm. Best of all might be Safe Space, on which eccentric Japanese singer Maya Kuroki howls over a weirdly funky slice of Tinariwen-style fuzz-rock. It\u2019s a disorientating, exhausting but ultimately quite compelling collection. Also out this month: European-based US duo A Winged Victory for the Sullen make post-classical instrumentals pitched somewhere between orchestral miniatures and ambient music, often for soundtracks and ballet scores. The Undivided Five, their debut for Ninja Tune after four albums on the Erased Tapes label, adds modular synths to their string arrangements, but the synths are designed to sound like strings, while the low-volume violin and cello drones shimmer and mutate so delicately that you\u2019d think they were analogue synths. Nothing much happens harmonically but the textures are exquisite. Songs from the Bardo is a collaboration between pianist Jesse Paris Smith (daughter of Patti and Fred) and Tibetan singer and flautist Tenzin Choegyal, who have enlisted Laurie Anderson to recite passages from the Bardo Thodol, or the Tibetan Book of the Dead, in her calming, quizzical, hypnotic voice. Rubin Kodheli\u2019s cello blends well with the bowed gongs, crystal bowls and assorted Tibetan instruments, but it\u2019s difficult to see this as anything other than a rather upmarket new age meditation tape."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
