The Wellcome Trust, which runs the institute, has decided that the \u00a330m animal laboratory, where mice, rats and zebrafish are bred for medical experiments, should be shut within the next three years. It was set up 12 years ago and employs 70 staff. The institute \u2013 which played a leading role in the first sequencing of the human genome \u2013 says its scientists are now using fewer and fewer animals in their research. \u201cOur science strategy is changing. It is as simple as that,\u201d Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, told the Observer. \u201cNew laboratory techniques have recently been developed which mean we simply do not need the numbers of animals that were once required for our experiments. We still need animals for our research, but not as many as in the past.\u201d As a result, the Sanger is seeking a partner organisation that would provide an animal experimentation service for its scientists, though this will no longer be based at the institute. But this approach has been questioned by other scientists. \u201cI think that the Sanger decision is disappointing,\u201d said geneticist Professor Ian Jackson, of Edinburgh University. \u201cAt present, techniques such as cell cultures cannot tell the whole story of what a mutated gene does. You need to observe what it does inside a living animal. A gene can have an unexpected impact in some organs.\u201d The use of animals in scientific experiments has been a cause of controversy for decades and has been opposed \u2013 sometimes violently \u2013 by activists. However, scientists have defended the practice on the grounds that it has led to significant medical advances, from the development of penicillin to the creation of drugs to treat breast cancer. The crucial point is that animals like mice may have very different appearances from that of humans, but they share virtually the same set of genes. Almost every gene found in a mouse so far has been found in a closely related form in a human. And the importance of this genetic similarity underpins the worries that some scientists have about the Sanger decision. \u201cWe recently carried out experiments on mice in which we had disabled a random set of their genes and found several that, unexpectedly, affected their hearing,\u201d said Professor Karen Steel, of King\u2019s College London, whose current research focuses on deafness. \u201cThese have been shown to affect humans in a similar way, which greatly helps us to understand deafness in men and women. You simply cannot make discoveries like that in a culture dish, and it is premature to move in that direction,\u201d she said. Sanger scientists said they did not intend to halt all animal experiments but merely planned to carry out fewer procedures on living creatures. The development of techniques such as cells grown in culture and the creation of organoids, miniaturised versions of animal or human organs \u2013 such as the pancreas and kidney \u2013 now made it possible to think about reducing numbers of animal experiments, they argued. \u201cThis is a positive story,\u201d Farrar said. \u201cThe development of tissue culture and organoids has opened up the possibility of reducing animal experiments. It won\u2019t take away the need to carry out all such procedures, but it should help to keep them down.\u201d This point was backed by Professor Mike Stratton, director of the Sanger. \u201cThis has been a difficult decision,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we believe it is the best way to continue to deliver science and make discoveries that impact on human health.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
