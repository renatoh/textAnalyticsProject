The allegation, which was denied by the Tibetan spiritual leader, came as security chiefs in Beijing claimed monks have been building up arsenals of weapons that could be used to escalate the conflict, which has already claimed at least 20 lives. Wu Heping, a spokesman for the public security ministry, said police had searched monasteries and uncovered 176 guns, 13,013 bullets, 7,725 pounds of explosives, 19,000 sticks of dynamite and 350 knives. \"To our knowledge, the next plan of the Tibetan independence forces is to organise suicide squads to launch violent attacks,\" Wu told a news conference. \"They claimed that they fear neither bloodshed nor sacrifice.\" The Tibetan government in exile denied the accusation, saying it remained dedicated to nonviolent struggle. \"Again, the Chinese are trying to portray that we Tibetans are instigating violence and now they are talking about suicide squads, and we strongly deny these allegations,\" said Tenzin Taklha, a senior aide of the Dalai Lama. He said Beijing should focus on why Tibetans feel resentful about Chinese rule, and engage in dialogue with the Dalai Lama. No evidence has been forthcoming for any of the charges and the ministry has not provided the names of the suspects. However, Wu said China has arrested \"key members\" of an underground network in Lhasa working with overseas pro-Tibet independence groups to prompt a \"Tibet people's uprising movement\". He said the Tibetan Youth Congress and other participants drew up a blueprint last year to disrupt the Olympics and foment unrest in Tibetan areas. \"They reached agreement after consulting with high-level leaders in the Dalai clique,\" Wu said. Beijing announced at the weekend that a monk had confessed to working as an agent of the government in exile. State media said the monk had distributed pamphlets calling for an uprising, as well as passing on information using coded language. \"Uncle\" was a reference to the Dalai Lama, while \"skirts\" meant the banned Tibetan snow lion flag, Wu said. The protests started peacefully in the Lhasa and several cities in other countries on March 10, the anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising in 1959. Four days later, they erupted into violent riots in Lhasa, where Han and Hui Chinese were among the victim of ethnically motivated attacks by mobs of angry Tibetans. China says 22 people died in the chaos, including five female shop assistants who burned to death in an arson attack. Tibetan exile groups say the death toll is closer to 140, including protesters who were shot or beaten by police in Lhasa and Tibetan communities in neighbouring provinces. Washington defended the Dalai Lama, saying he was as \"a man of peace\". \"There is absolutely no indication that he wants to do anything other than have a dialogue with China on how to discuss the serious issues there,\" US state department spokesman, Tom Case, told the Associated Press. \"We continue to encourage the Chinese to engage in dialogue with the Dalai Lama and his representatives.\" The unrest has either been doused down by a heavy riot police presence, or news has been prevented from reaching the outside world by tight restrictions on the movements of journalists. However, the rhetorical assaults have intensified. Tibet's Chinese Communist party boss, Zhang Qingli, has branded the Dalai Lama a \"wolf in monk's robes, a devil with a human face, but the heart of a beast\". The Chinese state media has condemned protesting monks as the \"scum of Buddhism\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
