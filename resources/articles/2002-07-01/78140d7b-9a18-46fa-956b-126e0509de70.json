For evidence one only has to look at the case of Jean Van de Velde. In the 1999 Open at Carnoustie, the Frenchman famously threw away a three-shot lead on the final hole to leave himself slogging his way through extra holes in the soupy gloom with Paul Lawrie and Justin Leonard. Lawrie won, but over the past three years Open-winning ghosts have cast more conspicuous shadows than the Scot. Meanwhile, the image of a barefoot and cheerful Van de Velde, quickly turning the best day of his life into the most humiliating, has become something enduring and lovable: a symbol of golfing heroism. Van de Velde did not qualify for Muirfield. Surely any governing body with a heart would have granted him a 20-year exemption after watching what happened at Carnoustie, and how gracefully he dealt with it. The good news is that Van de Velde still made the trip to the Open as part of the BBC's new-look (sort of) commentary team. This says a lot about the Frenchman's forgiving nature, since more hard-hearted competitors might have opted not to come within a three-wood of the corporation's Peter Alliss, given the sort of comments that Alliss made about Van de Velde as he played that final hole in 1999. \"I could listen to you speak all day,\" said an emollient Alliss to Van de Velde during Thursday's commentary, before proceeding regularly to talk over him for the remainder of the session. This trend has repeated itself over the first two rounds: Van de Velde - a man who applies the preparatory skills to commentary that top-class caddies apply to yardage charts - tries to say something insightful, then Alliss, or his partner in misnomers Alex Hay, interrupts by suggesting that all French people eat insects or describing a \"beautiful\" shot by \"David\" Love III. A Mr O'Connor from Dumfries emailed to complain about the BBC team's overuse of the word \"beautiful\" but asking Hay and Alliss not to say \"beautiful\" is like asking Tiger Woods not to beat par. The sense is that golf on the BBC is on the threshold of something new and groovy, without quite knowing what it is. Everywhere in the corporation's coverage this year there are incongruities, as new values battle old. Out on the course, the famed Olympic rower Matthew Pinsent and the former rugby speedster Jeremy Guscott conduct vox pops. By contrast, Ken \"Fascinating\" Brown makes a life-and-death issue out of grounding your club in a bunker. In the box, Sam Torrance tries to apply some arid wit to proceedings, while Alliss says things like \"Get on there, ykuk, get on there\" at ravens and Hay mistakes a six-month-old baby in the crowd for Andrew Oldcorn, the veteran European Tour player. Not since the time that Steve Rider cooked sausages live on TV with Colin Montgomerie at the US Masters has the BBC golf team seemed so at odds with its own image. And right in the middle of this identity crisis is Van de Velde: serene, sharp, with a velvet voice to match his Alain Delon looks. Buried within this most happy-go-lucky of golfing psyches, you sense, is a more relevant future for the game's terrestrial coverage - a way of being modern without being trivial. But we won't be able to confirm this until he's been given the chance to get a few more full sentences out.
