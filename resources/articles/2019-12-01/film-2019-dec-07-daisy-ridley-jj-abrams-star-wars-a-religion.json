She was surrounded by grownups, towering above her, when she abruptly and dramatically declared: \u201cI\u2019m shy!\u201d before running out of the room. \u201cMy mum told me I did that, so maybe I\u2019m remembering half an imprint of someone else\u2019s memory,\u201d she says, laughing at the irony of both commanding attention from her audience and then immediately rejecting it. It\u2019s a trait that has somehow stuck. At 27, Ridley finds herself at the centre of the universe. With three Star Wars films under her belt, the actor is adjusting to multiple layers of fame: there\u2019s the gilded A-list Hollywood kind that comes with red carpets, stylists and outfits gifted by the most sought-after designers; then the sort of fame that has tabloids tracking her most mundane moves, breathlessly documenting Ridley\u2019s \u201cbrave\u201d trip to the dry cleaner\u2019s (with no makeup!) or strolling through London wearing \u2013 gasp \u2013 a daisy print skirt. And then, of course, there\u2019s the fierce, cult-like superfan fame, where the force of millions of Star Wars obsessives will always be with her, the legacy of being plucked, as a fresh-faced 21-year-old unknown, by director JJ Abrams to play Rey, the scrappy scavenger mentored by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). We meet on a late autumn afternoon in one of London\u2019s grandest hotels. The Star Wars press campaign has occupied an entire floor and a corridor of suites is taken up by publicists, assistants and executives fixed on their phone screens. Ridley, wearing a dark denim Ulla Johnson boilersuit, cinched in at the waist and tucked into Christian Louboutin mesh ankle boots, takes a seat on a beige chaise longue in a very beige room, expertly low lit for movie stars. Her dark bob is slicked back, her cheekbones wide and high. She looks terrific \u2013 and when I say so, she immediately credits her stylist (Samantha McMillen, whose longest-standing clients are Johnny Depp and Elle Fanning), and a new trainer. \u201cI\u2019m the strongest and healthiest I\u2019ve ever been. I didn\u2019t get injured once [on set]. I actually got my kickboxing green belt during filming, which really felt like something.\u201d Ridley mugs a goofy face at her achievement. \u201cIt was honestly the best thing ever.\u201d The daughter of a communications director and a photographer, Ridley had done a few bit parts on TV (Toast Of London, Casualty, Mr Selfridge) and was working in a pub when she got the part of Rey six years ago. She was an ideal blank canvas for Abrams who, Ridley has said, wanted to project \u201cvulnerable and tough, sweet and terrified\u201d on to the character. Although comparisons to a young Keira Knightley were swift \u2013 the two look remarkably alike \u2013 Ridley held her own with fans and critics, and was heralded as \u201cterrific in a doozy of a breakout role\u201d by Variety. It\u2019s obvious Ridley enjoys an ease on screen; it helps, perhaps, that she was never really a Star Wars fan \u2013 like the then-unknown Mark Hamill in the original films, she was able to play her part unburdened by the weight of the franchise. Whether this delicate alchemy works in The Rise Of Skywalker remains to be seen: nobody gets to watch the new film until its premiere. From the start, Abrams warned her to understand the scale of what she was taking on: \u201cThis is not a role in a movie. This is a religion for people. It changes things on a level that is inconceivable,\u201d she recalls him telling her. But Ridley, who won a scholarship to boarding school in Hertfordshire and grew up with her older sisters Kika-Rose (a former model who works in production) and Poppy Sophia (a reiki instructor) in a pretty cobbled street in west London, radiates a natural charm and confidence. She is chatty, sitcom-expressive and enthusiastic; life right now is \u201cso amazing\u201d, \u201cglorious\u201d, \u201cfabulous\u201d. I can see how she won Abrams over. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard at points,\u201d she says of the attention that followed the release of The Force Awakens in 2015, fiddling with her earring. \u201cI have a thing with control, but it does get a bit easier. I texted my friend the other day and I was, like: \u2018Dude, please don\u2019t put pictures of me online.\u2019 Because it\u2019s that weird disconnect, that people don\u2019t ask people\u2019s permission before they post things.\u201d Ridley began therapy and binned social media two years ago, considering it an unnecessary invasion of her now closely guarded privacy. She is reportedly engaged to her boyfriend, the English actor Tom Bateman, whom she met while filming Murder On The Orient Express two years ago (a ring is on her finger, but she won\u2019t talk about her love life). Friends are reminded to put their phones away when they go to dinner together. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018You can\u2019t say where we are, not just because it\u2019s me \u2013 because it\u2019s not safe.\u2019 My friend has 50,000 followers and you\u2019re telling 50,000 people where you are right at that moment? That\u2019s scary.\u201d Was that an awkward conversation? Did she worry her friends would think she was becoming grand, or difficult? \u201cI\u2019ve never had an issue with saying things like that,\u201d Ridley says. \u201cI\u2019m not passively aggressive \u2013 I\u2019m just directly aggressive. It is a bit uncomfortable, because obviously I don\u2019t want to say to my friend, \u2018Please don\u2019t do that.\u2019 But I\u2019m not the one who should be feeling uncomfortable.\u201d She pauses to sip on a juice shot we\u2019ve both been given. \u201cFucking hell, is that just ginger? Oww, it\u2019s just ginger.\u201d She winces. \u201c Everybody needs to be more accountable for what they post and what they share. Recently, I met someone that knew of someone I vaguely knew that knew something about me they shouldn\u2019t have known. I was, like, \u2018Yeah, please don\u2019t talk about stuff like that.\u2019\u201d She exhales, before continuing. \u201cPeople think they know things about you, and that they know you \u2013 it\u2019s a constant imbalance. I wish people sometimes would go: \u2018Hey, what do you do?\u2019 so I can say it, but people see me and are, like, \u2018A-haaa!\u2019\u201d She is careful to add the caveat that she is \u201cof course, grateful and lucky\u201d. It gets to her most when the fame affects those closest to her. \u201cRecently, my family went to a wedding and it was really uncomfortable, because people assumed they knew me and only directed questions to me. My sister who was with me was basically ignored. I cannot stand that. It\u2019s just rude.\u201d I ask if she thinks it has been easier to be confident and navigate her celebrity because of the privilege in her life \u2013 of boarding school, her upbringing and so on? Ridley is suddenly incredulous. \u201cThe privilege I have \u2013 how? No, genuinely, how?\u201d Well, I say, in terms of wealth, class, education \u2013 that kind of privilege, in knowing how to decode the rules in certain spaces. As a caveat, I add that both of us have privilege, and it\u2019s not a criticism; I was simply curious to know what she thought. Things take an awkward turn. \u201cWell no, because, no\u2026 \u201d There is a very long and tense pause, before she insists that, actually, there is little difference between her experience and that of her co-star John Boyega, who grew up in south London to British Nigerian immigrant parents. \u201cJohn grew up on a council estate in Peckham and I think me and him are similar enough that\u2026 no... Also, I went to a boarding school for performing arts, which was different.\u201d But surely nine years of private education gave her some additional confidence? \u201cNo.\u201d Ridley leans on her elbow while twirling a small knot in her hair. \u201cNo. I think, also, it has taken me a little while to be OK with it. I was always fairly confident, and I think that comes from being part of a big family who are all quite chatty.\u201d It\u2019s an unexpectedly defensive detour, as if the mere mention of privilege is an attempt to diminish Ridley\u2019s hard work or talent. I try to change the subject but get the distinct feeling that her publicist, sitting behind me in Ridley\u2019s eyeline, has made some sort of silent intervention. \u201cI\u2019m not saying what you\u2019re saying is wrong,\u201d Ridley adds. \u201cI\u2019ve just never been asked that before, so I\u2019m like, oh. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d We move on. * * * Despite starring in one of the biggest film franchises in history, Ridley didn\u2019t know much about cinema while growing up and is still working through lists of \u201cmust-sees\u201d that have been passed on to her by friends. Her cultural touchstones were the film Matilda, Disney, Pink and the Spice Girls, and musicals such as Chicago. At the wrap party for the final instalment of the sequel\u2019s trilogy, Abrams gifted her a Lion King score signed by Elton John, \u201cbecause me and John [Boyega] were always messing about re-enacting the, \u2018Waahh, Simba!\u2019 scene\u201d. But for the most part, growing up she was, \u201cI don\u2019t know, just hanging out. I worked in Abercrombie &amp; Fitch as a mere T-shirt folder.\u201d She says this meant she was able to gatecrash nights out with the models who worked there, \u201cgoing to fancy places like [Mayfair private members\u2019 club] Maddox where I\u2019d be on the fringes of their table, sipping my free vodka cranberry\u201d. Parties aren\u2019t her thing anyway. She got invited to an Oscars one hosted by \u2013 she thinks \u2013 Madonna. \u201cI want to say Madonna? Anyway, I was so tired and didn\u2019t go, so my dad went. He\u2019s great at parties and had a great time. I\u2019m more of a dinner person, I was never really a partier.\u201d Has she ever been out until lunchtime the next day? \u201cNo!\u201d Ridley gags and laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t take drugs, so if I make it past 2am, I\u2019m like, \u2018Look at me! This is only life and a little bit of alcohol, and I am still going!\u2019\u201d Ridley is vegan and doesn\u2019t drink often \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about not letting go, I just don\u2019t like being drunk\u201d \u2013 but did revel in the wild anecdotes that Carrie Fisher would let slip on set. \u201cOh my God, she was so sassy and had all these amazing stories. I can\u2019t mention any names but things that only happen with Americans who live in big houses in the middle of nowhere.\u201d Fisher famously told Ridley to be careful about who she dated after Star Wars because, as in her case, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to give people the ability to say, \u2018I slept with Princess Leia.\u2019\u201d Were they particularly close on set? \u201cOh, she was so smart and so funny. She went through things, like wearing the gold bikini [in Return Of The Jedi], so I didn\u2019t end up having to do those things, and I\u2019m so grateful.\u201d Ridley was in the cinema when she got the phone call telling her that Fisher had died. \u201cI spoke to [my publicist] Heidi, and went to the bathroom and wailed. Someone sweetly came up to me and asked if I wanted a refund for my ticket. I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m fine\u2019 and then I wailed more, and then I had a parking ticket and was, like, this is all awful.\u201d Fisher had played Leia as a general leading the Resistance against the First Order in the last two films. How did they work around the loss in The Rise Of Skywalker? \u201cEveryone is really happy with the way the footage has been used, even though it\u2019s difficult to do and watch. Billie [Lourd, Fisher\u2019s daughter] is in the film, and she says it was a way of working with her mum again. It\u2019s one of those weird things where it\u2019s as satisfying as can be, even amid all the trauma.\u201d As for what comes next, Ridley says she\u2019s \u201csadly unemployed, but I have itchy feet\u201d. There are projects she can\u2019t talk about yet, \u201cthings that are almost ready\u201d. She is full of praise for her agent who she says deserves a producer credit on Ophelia (Ridley\u2019s last major film, a reimagining of Hamlet also starring Naomi Watts and Clive Owen), as \u201cshe practically made that happen\u201d. For the most part, she is now sifting through scripts. \u201cI had an amazing script and then a meeting with the director and it was just really weird, like, a really weird vibe.\u201d She grins. \u201cThen Hylda had a conversation with the director and was, like, \u2018Nope \u2013 no, you\u2019re not doing it.\u2019 \u201cStar Wars has given me the opportunity to do smaller things and allowed me to say no, which is glorious. I don\u2019t talk a lot about various things because there are people fighting the good fight, and I know I have safety in that the people I have worked with have loud voices.\u201d It\u2019s an elliptical allusion to \u2013 I think \u2013 equal pay and #MeToo in the industry. She rubs her nose, before explaining some more. \u201cWell, there was another film I really wanted to do, but there were a number of factors that meant I didn\u2019t believe it was right.\u201d How so? \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t equal and all that stuff, so I said no, even though that\u2019s really scary. But how much of a blessing is it to be able to say no?\u201d Given that Disney owns Star Wars, is she conscious of what issues she can talk about publicly? Does she have to modify, say, her politics? \u201cNo. I don\u2019t feel I have to edit what I say \u2013 the things that make me angry are the things that make everyone angry. Everyone is annoyed with BoJo. Everyone has an issue with Trump \u2013 every sane person anyway.\u201d She smiles brightly at me, almost apologetic, reluctant to expand. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t talk about this stuff, but other people are so much more articulate than me and say it better.\u201d Our time is being signalled to a close. She bounces up from the stiff-looking chaise longue, still lively and energetic. \u201cThis [was] starting to feel like a therapy session,\u201d she jokes, exhaling. A buzz of voices breaks out in the corridor, as the line of people looking to speak to Ridley, or get a picture of her, to find out what it\u2019s like to be her, gets imperceptibly smaller, interview by interview. I wonder where she\u2019s at her happiest. \u201cOn my parents\u2019 sofa,\u201d she replies without hesitating. \u201cI\u2019m happiest when I\u2019m having a nap on their sofa, because there\u2019s always a murmur of their voices. I find that very, very comforting.\u201d \u2022 Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker is out on 19 December. Styling: Samantha McMillen/The Wall Group. Hair: Mara Roszak/SWA.
