People liked it, and so Packham began posting daily videos enthusing about spring unfurling around his home in the New Forest. Shortly before lockdown, he was called away for a final film commitment, but still wanted to post a daily video. He persuaded his stepdaughter, Megan McCubbin, 25, to step in. The Self-Isolating Bird Club was born, with Packham and McCubbin, who locked down together at his cottage, using two mobile phones and Skype to broadcast a live daily show online that celebrated our connection with the natural world. There seemed unquenchable thirst for their enthusiasm, their banter, and ordinary wildlife \u2013 from nesting blackbirds to badger skulls. Eight million people around the world tuned in over a month of broadcasts. Five months on, as coronavirus tightens its grip on an increasingly downcast nation, people are again turning to the zoologist and her stepdad, who are now presenting together on BBC2\u2019s Autumnwatch. The secret lives of other species are consoling and cheering, but so is the rapport between McCubbin and Packham. They tease each other, but also nod in harmony over their shared beliefs in the wonder of nature and the importance of activism. When I meet them at Packham\u2019s home, tucked in the woods west of Southampton, I ask why they think audiences responded so well when they began broadcasting together? \u201cA lot of people were locked down with their families, so it was this mirror image,\u201d says McCubbin. \u201cThe familiarity of those relationships are quite nice to watch. People saw a different side to Chris, too, we both relaxed into it. We were ourselves, there was no script. It was just very natural.\u201d An obsessive, occasionally irascible naturalist trapped with his more free-wheeling stepdaughter who usually drifts between the homes of her mum, dad, Packham and her partner, sounds like a recipe for conflict. What irritated them during lockdown? \u201cOooh, the list comes out,\u201d laughs McCubbin. But Packham\u2019s having none of it: \u201cWe are quite unspokenly sensible. There are certain things that each one of us can do which the other one can\u2019t do well, or at all.\u201d \u201cCooking. Cleaning,\u201d murmurs McCubbin. The Self-Isolating Bird Club was classic Packham: he did it himself. Ever since the teenage Packham lowered his record player needle on to the opening track of the Damned\u2019s Damned Damned Damned LP purchased from Woolworths in March 1977, he has been in thrall to punk music and its rebellious, DIY principles. He abandoned a doctorate to become a wildlife cameraman and then, despite his long-hidden Asperger\u2019s, or perhaps because of it, talked his way into presenting a hugely successful children\u2019s series, The Really Wild Show, when he was 25. He\u2019s rarely been off screen since. But a prolific career as an increasingly cherished TV naturalist has not hindered a myriad of other creative projects \u2013 Packham paints, takes professional photographs, wrote an astonishing memoir called Fingers in the Sparkle Jar, and has become an outspoken voice against this age of extinction. In the past three years alone, he\u2019s organised a mass march for wildlife, corralled experts to write A People\u2019s Manifesto for Wildlife and co-founded Wild Justice, a crowd-funded legal group that has successfully challenged the government\u2019s treatment of wildlife in courts. His latest side-project? A calendar celebrating animal poo, photographed, written, designed and sold by himself via his website. Another theme of these endeavours is Packham\u2019s eagerness to collaborate with young people. Alongside his creative partnership with McCubbin, Packham readily admits that the Self-Isolating Bird Club only took flight because of a \u201cunique wizard\u201d, a 21-year-old conservationist called Fabian Harrison, who met Packham at his wildlife march and told the broadcaster he could much better \u201cmaximise his social media potential\u201d. Packham handed over his passwords to Harrison \u2013 \u201cI might be nearly 60, but I still take risks,\u201d he says \u2013 and Harrison produced their online show from his bedroom in Norwich. \u201cHe was the brains behind it,\u201d says McCubbin. \u201cHe was the real driver. He said, \u2018We can get live guests in from around the world and we can show live cameras of birds from anywhere you want.\u2019 He had this vision and drove us.\u201d The success of the Self-Isolating Bird Club and its intimate focus on local wildlife may yet prove to be transformative in how wildlife television is made. More immediately, it transformed McCubbin\u2019s working life. Springwatch, a fixture in BBC TV schedules since 2005, was looming but because of lockdown, Packham\u2019s main co-presenter, Michaela Strachan, couldn\u2019t travel from her home in South Africa. So McCubbin was thrown into presenting duties alongside Packham. \u201cIt\u2019s different obviously, Michaela and I, and Megan and I,\u201d says Packham, \u201cbut that chatty interaction, unscripted banter, a bit of frivolity, was there. I think [Springwatch\u2019s producers] saw that happening [on the Self-Isolating Bird Club] and thought, \u2018We can\u2019t miss a trick here.\u2019 It made sense. But they just needed to trust Megs to pull it off.\u201d McCubbin was understandably nervous, having never presented live TV to an audience of millions. \u201cAs I repeatedly said to her, you\u2019ve been doing it for weeks online, with no script and no planning,\u201d says Packham. There was a hugely positive audience response to a young woman joining the Springwatch presenting team, but did McCubbin receive social media barbs that she only got the gig through her stepdad? \u201cThere\u2019s been a couple of comments, definitely, but not as many as I thought. I\u2019ve worked hard getting my degree, researching and getting involved in science. But being around Chris I know is a huge privilege. I\u2019m very aware of how lucky I am.\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019ve still got to be able to do the job,\u201d chips in Packham. As a child, McCubbin \u2013 whose mum, Jo, was Packham\u2019s partner for a decade \u2013 travelled with him as he made wildlife programmes. She was initially hesitant around some animals, such as the family\u2019s pet tarantula, but credits Packham with shaping her love of nature. When her mother split from Packham, he and McCubbin remained close. \u201cHe took me to art galleries, the opera and punk rock gigs \u2013 he showed me the whole spectrum. But when you go on set and there\u2019s lion cubs around, it\u2019s hard not to go down that route.\u201d Did she learn from watching him communicate complicated natural science on live TV? \u201cI like to take my time and prep a little more than Chris does because he can just turn up and they\u2019ll tell him five minutes before he goes live, \u2018You\u2019re talking about the hairstreak butterfly today,\u2019 and he\u2019ll just ramble it off without any prior preparation.\u201d \u201cI long ago learned how to be talking about something and thinking about something else at the same time,\u201d says Packham. \u201cSo you can be thinking about what you\u2019re going to say in a minute while having a conversation now.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know this, but Chris is half alien,\u201d whispers McCubbin. \u201cThere is something extra- terrestrial about him. I often say I\u2019d like a sliver of his brain, and he kind of smirks.\u201d Packham has experienced the fluctuations of a career in television. Was he worried about McCubbin following in his footsteps? \u201cMegs knows that TV is not the be-all-and-end-all. It\u2019s not about saving lives, it\u2019s about trying to share a passion, entertain and inform people. You\u2019ve got to have other interests. If Megs had said to me when she was 12, \u2018I want to be a TV presenter\u2019, I would\u2019ve been horrified, because it\u2019s one of those things you\u2019re better off drifting into. Then it\u2019s not about your ego, it\u2019s about your purpose.\u201d As part of their drive to convince us to better cherish other species, Packham and McCubbin have also spent this summer writing a book together, Back to Nature. It celebrates the bond with wildlife that many formed for the first time while confined at home this spring, but also explains the biodiversity crisis and examines contributors to this great wave of extinctions \u2013 from salmon farming and pesticides to the persecution of hen harriers. It is well-researched \u2013 with McCubbin providing short scientific interludes \u2013 and more nuanced than you might expect from Packham\u2019s many Twitter rants. Is he becoming more diplomatic in old age? \u201cNo, I\u2019m getting more strategic,\u201d he says. \u201cI got very angry this afternoon about the Japanese restarting whaling. I don\u2019t blame the Japanese, I blame the world\u2019s conservationists for letting them do it. They just said, \u2018Er, that\u2019s not a very good idea at all.\u2019 And then nothing happened. It\u2019s our fault. I still get very angry. There\u2019s no dulling of the blade. The blade if anything is getting sharper and more useful because I\u2019m running out of time. There\u2019s less time in my lifetime to make a difference.\u201d And so Back to Nature is also an invitation to take action, showing how ordinary people can help wildlife and become activists. Does McCubbin, for all her tact, belong to a generation of young people who are more radical than Packham\u2019s punk peers? \u201cI think we have to be,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are growing up in a time when we\u2019re going to see the climate crisis more than generations before. Kids younger than me are going to really feel it \u2013 and their children certainly will.\u201d So far, however, despite parliament\u2019s pledge to go net zero by 2050, there seems more patronising head-patting of the young than action. Since the world was consumed by coronavirus there\u2019s been hopeful talk of a post-Covid \u201cgreen recovery\u201d, but the British government has pledged a pitiful \u00a340m to green jobs creation while throwing half-a-billion at Eat Out to Help Out and billions more on HS2 and new roads. Business as usual. \u201cIt\u2019s buffoons as usual,\u201d says Packham. But he and McCubbin remain surprisingly hopeful. \u201cYou need to mobilise 3.5% of a population in order to see proper legislative and policy change. It\u2019s not much at all,\u201d says McCubbin. \u201cSo much has changed because of peaceful activism. Look at the civil rights movement and the suffragettes. We\u2019re now at a point where we need environmental change and we need an environmental revolution. That\u2019s coming.\u201d \u201cThe problem is, we see the world as a big place. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s a small place,\u201d says Packham, \u201cYou drive from Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats 30 times and you\u2019ve reached Australia. It\u2019s a relatively small planet and everything we do as individuals, wherever we are, influences other individuals in other parts of the planet, and that recognition will kick in at a certain point. Then change will happen quite quickly.\u201d Back to Nature: How to Love Life \u2013 and Save It by Chris Packham and Megan McCubbin (Two Roads, \u00a320) is out on 12 November.
