Tash, the daughter of a mysterious Russian billionaire, arrives at an English boarding school. Then we\u2019re into 224 pages of sheer audacity and voice as Tash tries to figure out who she is. Thomas is satirically attuned to the intricate frustration of teen life, the ignoble obsessions of puerile minds and the speed at which hygiene, decorum and false pretences vanish in a single-sex boarding institution. This makes for an entertaining, irreverent and wrong-hilarious read. The girls engage in competitive anorexic narcissism (\u201cFruit has been specifically bred by insatiable, corrupt farmers to be full of sugar\u201d), mortification of the flesh through sport and snobbery about local \u201cplebs\u201d whose tattoos are \u201cdesperate cries for help rendered in fading ink\u201d. The girls both enact and encounter various forms of contempt, inappropriateness, ambiguity and sleaze. The novel is full of brilliant lines and I\u2019m deliberately not quoting the best ones, to save them for buying readers. OK, just one. Some male trauma counsellors come to visit: \u201cLook, where do you even get two therapists who look so much like paedophiles? ...[One of them] has the eyes of a lifeguard who lets people down.\u201d I came to Oligarchy having devoured Thomas\u2019s brilliant Worldquake fantasy series, similarly set in a remote town with young characters and a strange school. She is on a red-hot streak of invention right now and these narratives succeed because of the novelist\u2019s deep understanding of the cracks and quirks of such communities. Underneath the inconsequentiality of Tash\u2019s teenage high jinks is a barely repressed sense of panic and self-doubt. She is full of fear about returning to her old life of \u201cpeople shouting at each other, but always about the wrong things\u201d. When Thomas slows down for a moment I am reminded how excellent her dialogue is. She expertly conveys the complexities of character through natural speech, as when Tash is advised by her worldly Aunt Sonja or has a date with a privileged guy who is at once snobbish and observant and \u201csmelled triply of boy and man and animal\u201d. The text is haunted faintly by other narratives. I caught whiffs of The Virgin Suicides, The Crucible, The Bling Ring, Clueless, Alan Warner\u2019s The Sopranos, Picnic at Hanging Rock, the fervour of Antonia White\u2019s Frost in May and the anguish of Edward St Aubyn. But these don\u2019t stick, banished by the sheer blast of stroppy, scathing energy. This is more like Malory Towers with wifi or Sweet Valley High with the sweetness taken out. There are sinister whispers about murder, suicide, mass hysteria and tragic school folklore. But they are outweighed by the wit, which is plentiful, freewheeling and almost shocking in its callousness, like the childhood memories of when a girl \u201cdropped acid and watched The Silence of the Lambs while the house flooded and no one did anything\u201d. Despite the occasional spangles of darkness, this is hugely enjoyable. It\u2019s about as menacing as a cool girl\u2019s black glitter nail polish \u2013 and just as much fun. \u2022 Oligarchy by Scarlett Thomas is published by Canongate (\u00a314.99).
