When Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand began his 14-year rule with his presidential victory in 1981, a leading opponent was prompted by the civil war on the centre-right to wonder (anonymously) \"Do we have the stupidest right wing in the world?\" The question might now be asked of the French Socialists after the recent poll between the two sides in the party, which ended with a victory for the \"traditionalist\" camp led by Martine Aubry by just 102 of the 134,784 valid votes cast. The rancour surrounding the party is such that a reconciliation between Aubry and the former presidential candidate S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal seems out of the question. There may be efforts to paper over the cracks, but the melodramatic exchanges at the weekend, including accusations of cheating and threats of legal action, have aggravated the bad blood on the left. Royal still wants a new ballot while Aubry heads a coalition whose only rationale is \"Anything but S\u00e9go\". In historical terms, the Socialists are back to kind of infighting seen between Jacques Chirac, Raymond Barre, and Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing that doomed the French right to the presidential wilderness, before Chirac was ushered into the Elys\u00e9e Palace in 1995 by the collapse of the Mitterrand experiment and the long depression that ensued his failed burst for growth in 1981/2. That is excellent news for a head of state elected on the promise of economic growth, tax cuts, liberalisation of the labour market and reduced unemployment. In his first year in office, Sarkozy certainly stumbled and aroused debate about just how serious a figure he was \u2013 a bruising politician and election winner, for sure, but perhaps lacking the gravitas needed to assume the raiment of Charles de Gaulle. Now, like Gordon Brown, Sarkozy has benefited politically from the crisis. His stock has risen in the polls. He can jettison policies that were not working in the name of flexibility. With Angela Merkel adopting a low profile across the Rhine, he has no difficulty in striding forth as the leader of the euro zone \u2014 even if the anti-inflationary dogmas of the European Central Bank still irk him. What makes the plight of France's Socialists so dire is that this is not a matter of policies or of building a new platform with which to challenge Sarkozy. It's personal, and poisonously so, in its way worse than the plight of the Labour party pre-Blair. Royal's failed bid for the presidency in 2007 has bred a legacy from which any sane party would have wanted to run a mile. The candidate insists that she would run again, in 2012, but she and the party elders \u2014 the \"elephants\" \u2014 are at loggerheads, as they were during her campaign. Royal and her former partner, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, have split both personally and politically. Sarkozy played a clever hand in detaching two of the party's top figures: Bernard Kouchner to become the minister of foreign and European affairs and Dominique Strauss-Kahn to head the IMF. The pragmatic mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delano\u00eb, who briefly seemed to offer an answer, has faded. The far left, in the person of the winsome Trotsykite postman, Olivier Besan\u00e7on, still in his mid-thirties, drains off support from those fed up with traditional politics. The once-powerful Communist party, which had allied with Mitterrand in 1981, is a shadow of its former self. The unions can flex their muscles, but face declining popularity. An attempt to launch a strong centrist movement, with which Royal says she will talk, has made little impact. Time, one might think, for something new on the left. But what we got during the inner-party campaign was an ever-more determined Royal holding meetings at which she appeared to float into the realm of metaphysical dreams while Aubry, the Socialist minister who brought France the 35-hour week, emerged form her northern stronghold in Lille to head the old Socialist faithful. There was rhetoric aplenty, but little in the way of new ideas, let alone cohesive answers to the challenges France faces. The fervour Royal arouses among her supporters burns brightly, as does the hostility she arouses with her one-woman crusade for what she calls renewal, but which her opponents regard as the vacuous phrase-making of a hyper-charged ambition. Equally, there is no doubting the determination of the old guard round Aubry to cling on to the party with which they have spent their lives. After 12 years of often dispiriting rule by Chirac, the 2007 election should have been the occasion for the left to regain power in the swings-and-roundabouts pattern of French politics. Royal, and the internal bickering on her party, blew that chance. Now, the same factors look like depriving France of an effective opposition in the midst of an economic crisis where it should be coming up with constructive critical ideas. Perhaps Strauss-Kahn will ride in as the white knight from Washington with his reputation enhanced by the IMF's role in bailing out faltering economies without the opprobrium that stuck to it in its 1990s rescue packages. But, for the moment, France has reverted to its 1980s character as a one-party state. This has an international implication in leaving Sarkozy even freer to act as he wishes than provided for by the quasi-monarchical constitution. He has problems, starting with a lack of money and a high state debt. But, if his record is anything to go by, he will live out his action-man persona to the full. That may be good in confronting the crisis, but it is hardly encouraging for the democratic process across the Channel. \u00b7 This article was amended on Monday December 1 2008. Bernard Kouchner is the minister of foreign and European affairs, not the prime minister. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
