The former presenter of Late Night Line-Up and Heart of the Matter said she was \u201coutraged and distressed\u201d when she heard the government was going to \u201cfoist\u201d the cost of free licence fees onto the BBC, describing the corporation as a \u201clifeline\u201d to many of the 5 million people aged over 75 in the UK. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite sneaky to roll out social policy disguised as a BBC contribution to austerity,\u201d Bakewell wrote in the new issue of Radio Times. \u201cIt isn\u2019t for the BBC to decide how and who receives government support.\u201d A Labour peer, Bakewell said BBC director general Tony Hall \u201cmust be smarting under the blow\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the social benefits government bestows on the old, like free bus passes and the winter fuel allowance,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen you are over 75, there are few perks in life as welcome as the free BBC television licence.\u201d Bakewell said older viewers and listeners who can afford it should write to TV Licensing, the body which collects the annual charge \u2013 currently \u00a3145.50 \u2013 and ask to start paying it again. \u201cSo what can we over-75s do? The BBC says it will introduce a scheme for those who want to opt back in to paying the licence fee. But that will take time. \u201cRight now I\u2019m told the best plan is to get in touch with TV Licensing, who collect the fee, and tell them you want to start paying again. If you love the BBC, and if you can afford \u00a32.80 a week, what are you waiting for?\u201d Bakewell said she got a \u201cstream of support\u201d when she floated the idea on Twitter. She compared the free licence to the winter fuel allowance which she said \u201cwasn\u2019t for the likes of me \u2013 well-heeled middle-class people with enough money to pay. My neighbour [singer] Robert Plant was bemused too, when he received his. Didn\u2019t they know he\u2019s a millionaire rock star?\u201d The BBC has said it will ask over-75s to voluntarily pay their licence fee after it was asked to take on the cost of the scheme in its latest controversial funding deal with the government, announced last week. The BBC said it would lead to a 10% real terms cut in its budget, although the Office for Budget Responsibility said it would be as high as 20%. Bakewell described the BBC as a \u201cpillar of British civic life, there\u2019s nothing on the planet like it \u2026 Heaven knows, what with the increase in aches and pains, and the loss of people you love, life gets bleaker as you get older. But there is always the BBC.\u201d A spokeswoman for TV Licensing said: \u201cAnyone aged 75 or over is entitled to a free TV licence for their main address, however this licence is not issued automatically and needs to be applied for. If you choose not to apply for your free licence when you reach 75 then you would simply continue to pay as normal. \u201cAnyone who has previously applied for an over-75 licence but chooses to start paying again would need to contact TV Licensing, cancel their existing concessionary licence and then pay for a new licence via any of our standard payment channels.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
