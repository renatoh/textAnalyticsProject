A band who will surely be featuring heavily on the tips for 2010 lists. They are the Andrew Weatherall-championed sound of young Sunderland: a quintet who only played their first gig last Christmas and have since been working in charity shops while rehearsing nights to become as tight as a street gang. The good old-fashioned route to pop stardom? Yes, and their name isn't the only other old-fashioned thing about the band. They dip into doo-wop and retro soul, love kitchen-sink dramas, the 1950s, \"jock rock\" (Altered Images, Postcard records), leftie politics and emerge somewhere between early Orange Juice and Kevin Rowland's stomping Dexy \"soul brothers\". All of which has been so unfashionable lately that Frankie and pals sound wonderfully fresh. Who is Frankie anyway? Frankie Francis, the latest fab pop Frankie after Frankie Lymon and the Holly Johnson-fronted Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Our Frankie is a part-time football commentator (covering Sunderland games for hospital radio) and mobile DJ turned bequiffed would-be icon. In the song Hunger, he urges his listeners: \"It's about time we made a stand ... We're waiting for you to come out tonight.\" And they claim to have the best trousers in pop. How can you deny their charms? Where can we hear them? The 7in single of Hunger, backed by Fragile, is released on 7 December on Rough Trade. A limited edition live 10in is also available from popsexltd.com and at their shows \u2013 they're the support for Florence and the Machine's December tour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
