Government members over the past two days had mostly described participants as patriots and played down the nature of the xenophobic messages. But Jewish groups called on the Polish authorities to condemn the message of banners with slogans such as \u201cpure blood, clear mind\u201d or \u201cEurope will be white or uninhabited\u201d that some nationalists carried at a march on 11 November \u2013 the anniversary of Polish independence from Russia, Austria and Germany at the end of the first world war. Though many families took part in the march, the event was organised by far-right groups and some carried banners with slogans like \u201cWhite Europe of brotherly nations\u201d or had flags with Celtic crosses \u2013 a white supremacist symbol. There were also antisemitic and anti-Muslim slogans and chants. One large banner read \u201cDeus Vult\u201d in Gothic lettering. Latin for \u201cGod wills it,\u201d it was a cry used during the First Crusade in the 11th century, when a Christian army from Europe slaughtered Jews and Muslims in the Holy Land. In recent years, it has been used by the radical right to show hostility to Islam. President Andrzej Duda said that \u201cthere is no place in Poland\u201d for xenophobia, pathological nationalism and antisemitism and that the country must remain a land open to all who want to come together and work for the good of the nation. He said it makes no difference if a person\u2019s father was \u201cGerman, Jewish, Belarusian, Russian, or whatever\u201d. Earlier, the foreign ministry had said it strongly condemned racist, antisemitic and xenophobic ideas, but insisted the march was largely an expression of patriotic feeling, calling it \u201ca great celebration of Poles, differing in their views, but united around the common values of freedom and loyalty to an independent homeland\u201d. Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon called the event \u201ca dangerous march of extreme and racist elements\u201d. \u201cWe hope that Polish authorities will act against the organizers,\u201d Nahshon said in a statement to the Associated Press. \u201cHistory teaches us that expressions of racist hate must be dealt with swiftly and decisively.\u201d Agnieszka Markiewicz, director of the Warsaw office of the American Jewish Committee \u2013 a global Jewish advocacy group, said the holiday \u201cwas seriously marred by hateful, far-right throngs that threaten the core values of Poland and its standing abroad\u201d. On Monday, a small group of civic rights activists also protested what they saw as the authorities\u2019 failure to respond properly to the behavior of the nationalists. In a really in front of Warsaw city hall they chanted \u201cWarsaw free from fascism!\u201d One man held a banner saying, \u201cPoland, wake up. Fascism is coming.\u201d They then proceeded to a police station to protest there too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
