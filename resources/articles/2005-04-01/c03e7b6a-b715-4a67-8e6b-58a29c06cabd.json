Campaigners are feeling the strain of early morning starts, meetings every three hours, the constant pressure to deliver the knockout blow and rebut the endless attacks. But there are fleeting moments to sit back and dream of a jubilant election night. Before 1997 I remember at this stage contemplating the possibility of Labour finally winning power after 18 years, yet knowing that one horrendous blunder could make it all go wrong. The aim of the final 10 days is to hone the campaign into its essential winning components. This is where political judgment - a mix of instinct, polling information, the mood on the ground - counts for everything. There will be heated arguments about the right combination of positive and attacking campaigning. What is more likely to get Labour's vote out - revulsion at Michael Howard's nasty rightwing campaign, the threat the Tories pose to economic stability or positive messages about schools and hospitals? Iraq still looms over the campaign. Tony Blair will be tempted to make the case again on Iraq in the last 10 days. If the Lib Dems run hard on it, he may be forced to. The Tories' only strategic success, and Labour should not underestimate it, has been its ability to stay focused on its 10-word campaign. My sense is that on the ground this is proving more effective than the headline poll numbers suggest. I believe in the repetition of messages during elections, on the basis that the public hear so much from so many sources that they need to know in boiled-down terms what each party stands for. That was the point of Labour's five pledges in 1997. Labour needs to boil down its own messages for the final 10 days. It has got a powerful new line: \"If you value it, vote for it.\" It needs to return to both the economy, where low mortgages, one of Labour's trump cards, has been underplayed, and improved schools and hospitals as the two big reasons for voting Labour. Two further things are needed. We need to see Tony Blair, unscripted and spontaneous, setting out his passionate case for a third term. Finally, Labour needs to build on its successful manifesto launch by fleshing out what it would do in the first few months of its third term. What the Labour campaign will fear most is that people see the lead in the polls as a reason to \"send Blair a mes sage\". The race is too tight in too many key seats for that luxury to be a safe option. In some ways Labour will hope there is a rogue poll this week that shows the parties neck and neck. It will want natural Labour voters to realise that there is still a lot at stake and unless they vote Labour, there is a real - not imagined - danger that the Tories will get in. \u00b7 Peter Hyman was a strategist on the last two Labour election campaigns.
