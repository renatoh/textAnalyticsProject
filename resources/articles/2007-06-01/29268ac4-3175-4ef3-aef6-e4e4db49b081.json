It followed Melanie South's win over Alicia Molik, the former top-10 Australian, on Monday, and a 6-2, 2-6, 7-6 success earlier yesterday by Elena Baltacha over Anne Keothavong, her regular sparring partner during her formative years and the current British No1. Baltacha celebrated as though she had taken a title, not because she was settling old scores but because, after years of injuries and illness and a back operation which almost ended her career, it suggested that she is back at least to her former level. This means that, draw permitting, she might make a first-week ripple at Wimbledon, as she did in 2002, and might even go on to become the first British woman to break in the top 100 in eight years. The 23-year-old still has a heavy serve and a big forehand which, when she imposes them on the rally, bully many players. But there were 150 ranking places at stake here, which made Baltacha play more introspectively after the first set, and at 2-4 in the decider she looked in trouble. But Keothavong fell and strained a thigh at 5-4, just when Baltacha was rediscovering some assertiveness. \"The trouble was, I knew that I would make a big leap if I won this match,\" she said. \"I went on my computer to have a look and then tried not to work just how big the leap would be.\" The win lifted her to \"270-ish\" in the world, up from last week's 437. It may not sound much, but in early May, five tournaments ago, she was 822nd and wondering if she would ever be doing this again. The Wimbledon champion Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo arrived here yesterday having had only one brief practice session in the last fortnight - at the British embassy in Paris, reputedly the only grass court in France. Like all the top four seeds Mauresmo received a bye in the first round. Today she returns to competitive action against Mara Santangelo, an Italian with an idiosyncratic swing which makes the ball sit down on clay, and behave sometimes like a snake on grass."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
