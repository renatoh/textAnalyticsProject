It could not be happening again, could it? The Chelsea defender had already got in the way of a deflected Nacho Monreal header to concede an own-goal equaliser in this helter-skelter Carabao Cup semi-final, second leg. It was happening again. Alexandre Lacazette had found a small pocket of space following a forward surge but Chelsea looked to have him under control. The Arsenal striker dug out a low cross and, almost in slow motion, it deflected off R\u00fcdiger to fall perfectly for Granit Xhaka. The Arsenal midfielder stretched out a leg and, following one more thump of R\u00fcdiger\u2019s heart, the ball was on its way into the far corner for the winner. It had been impossible to separate these rivals over 90 minutes in four previous meetings this season and it felt as though it might take something freakish to do so this time. R\u00fcdiger provided it and so Arsenal will face Manchester City in the final next month. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has never won this competition. Is the wait about to end? It was the most eclectic of tactical triumphs for the Arsenal manager. He had lined up in a 4-3-3 formation but, after a wobbly start, he switched to a system with wing-backs and Mohamed Elneny in front of the three centre-halves. Wenger\u2019s more advanced midfielders interchanged positions, with Mesut \u00d6zil in a particularly free role. Jack Wilshere said that \u201cwe might have got the formation wrong in the first 25 minutes\u201d. Wenger firmed up his changes at the interval and, by the end, he had Elneny in the middle of his three-man defence, Sead Kolasinac \u2013 a substitute \u2013 in front of the left wing-back, Monreal, and \u00d6zil roaming as a false nine. The new signing from Manchester United, Henrikh Mkhitaryan \u2013 who was cup-tied \u2013 watched from behind the bench. Wenger had been asked on Tuesday where he intended to play him. \u201cCentre-back, on the right,\u201d he began. On this evidence anything is possible. It was difficult to fathom, at times, but it worked. Arsenal deserved to progress to Wembley for a 10th time in four seasons \u2013 they have won each of the previous nine \u2013 and they never looked as though they would surrender the advantage that Xhaka gave them. Willy Caballero, the Chelsea goalkeeper, came up for a last-gasp corner but it came to nothing. Eden Hazard apart, Chelsea were off-colour and their cause was not helped when Willian felt his hamstring on the half-hour and was forced off. Conte suggested that the problem was not too serious but he launched into a post-match speech about the pressures on his small squad. These kind of injuries, he suggested, were the result of players playing too much. Where were the reinforcements from the transfer market? Conte\u2019s frustration was obvious and, he continued, the situation was not an overnight phenomenon. \u201cIt is the same from the summer,\u201d Conte said. He went on to lay the blame at the club\u2019s board. They decided on every player, he said. \u201cFor sure, I don\u2019t have a big impact on the transfer market,\u201d he added. Conte\u2019s future at Stamford Bridge is already in doubt. This felt like him picking an argument. The tie had crackled to life at the outset, with Chelsea pressing and Arsenal making mistakes. Alex Iwobi and Shkodran Mustafi erred with loose passes and the home crowd howled. Pedro had a fifth-minute header correctly disallowed for offside before he sent Hazard through and the forward beat David Ospina. Arsenal responded. Caballero blocked from Wilshere and then pawed the ball clear of the onrushing Monreal before R\u00fcdiger suffered his first moment of misfortune. Monreal\u2019s header from \u00d6zil\u2019s corner hit Marcos Alonso before ricocheting off R\u00fcdiger and flying past Caballero. Conte described the loss of Willian as \u201cdecisive\u201d. It led to a debut off the bench for Ross Barkley but Conte made the point that the January signing, bought from Everton for \u00a315m, was not yet fully assimilated. It was Barkley\u2019s first appearance since last May and Unsurprisingly, he looked off the pace. The attacking options of both teams were under the microscope. With Arsenal pushing hard to sign Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Borussia Dortmund, Lacazette needed a big game but he was restricted to feeding off scraps. On Chelsea\u2019s side it remains plain that Conte does not trust Michy Batshuayi. With \u00c1lvaro Morata injured he preferred Hazard as a false nine. Meanwhile the club\u2019s target, Edin Dzeko, played for Roma and he scored a last-minute equaliser against Sampdoria. Xhaka and \u00d6zil went close before the interval while Hazard slipped as he ran through early in the second half. Iwobi might have made the closing stages more comfortable for Arsenal had he finished from \u00d6zil\u2019s cross on 76 minutes but Wenger\u2019s team had done enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
