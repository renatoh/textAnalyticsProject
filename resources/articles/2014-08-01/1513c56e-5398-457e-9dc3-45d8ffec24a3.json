The day after her fifth birthday, her mother sent her away from their home in Kharkov, Ukraine, to the notoriously tough Perm ballet school in Russia. She would stay there as a boarder, seeing her mother only intermittently, for the next 13 years. Possibly as a consequence of her treatment at the school \u2013 a 2008 documentary film directed by David Kinsella (A Beautiful Tragedy) shows teachers insulting and intimidating Skorik and her fellow students \u2013 she developed an eating disorder, which she has since overcome. Skorik joined the Mariinsky Ballet in 2007, since when her ascent through the company's ranks has been steady. But she has had to cope with a campaign of unparalleled viciousness directed against her by a cabal of Russian ballet fans who claim that she has been promoted at the expense of other, better dancers. Montages of her onstage mistakes and more awkward moments have been posted on YouTube, with vitriolic comments attached. The authors, naturally, claim that this is all in the name of criticism and the good name of the Mariinsky, but one can only imagine the effect on Skorik herself. So it was instructive to see her take the star role in Swan Lake, on the first night of the ballet's run at Covent Garden. The dual role of Odette and Odile is a test of any ballerina, ruthlessly exposing any technical or dramatic weakness, so giving Skorik the opening performance was an important statement of confidence by Mariinsky director Yuri Fateyev. From her first entrance, you know that you're watching a potentially very fine dancer indeed. Skorik has a wide-set gaze, articulate arms and a streamlined physique in the long-legged, soft-backed Mariinsky mould. She makes resplendent shapes and strong lines, but her musical phrasing is uneven. As Odette, the white swan, she is by turns wild, sad and lonely, her eyes frequently freezing to blankness. With her Prince, the passionless if academically faultless Timur Askerov, she appears to have little rapport \u2013 strange, since he's her offstage partner. Watching Skorik is an unpredictable experience. But her flashes of brilliance, when they occur, are memorable. As Odile, the black swan, she seems to be hurling her performance in the face of all those who have ever made her unhappy. \"Watch this,\" her steely gaze orders, as she whips off 32 high-speed fouett\u00e9s and pulls up into a perfect double pirouette. It's impossible to tell what the future holds, but under the guidance of her coach, the former Kirov ballerina Elena Yevteyeva, Skorik has made astonishing technical progress. What lies behind her eyes may be harder to fix. The following day Yulia Stepanova performed the same ballet with Yorkshire-born Xander Parish. Stepanova is a smaller-scale dancer than Skorik, and without the same grandeur of line, but she is gorgeously sleek, and her work has a very appealing musicality. Like Skorik, Stepanova is much more engaging as Odile than Odette. Her white swan has its joyful moments \u2013 following the Act 2 adagio she gives Parish a look of the sheerest rapture \u2013 but she is too reliant, at moments of high emotion, on the knitted brow and the General Pained Expression. In the role of Odile, Stepanova cuts loose both dramatically and physically, delivering her steps with the creamy exultancy of a cat in a dairy. As her prince, Parish is nothing short of superb. He has come a long way in the four years since he departed the Royal Ballet for the Mariinsky, and Fateyev has turned him, as he promised to do, into a Russian danseur noble. Parish's Black Swan variation \u2013 soaring grand jet\u00e9s, effortlessly stylish tours en l'air \u2013 won him a huge roar of applause from the home crowd. His partnering is tender and self-effacing, his bearing aristocratic, his stage manners impeccable. Nor is any praise too great for the Mariinsky corps de ballet. They're not always perfect; at Skorik and Askerov's performance there were uneven swan lines and stony-faced cygnets. But when on form, as they were for Stepanova and Parish, they're heart-stopping \u2013 moving, breathing and hearing the music as one \u2013 especially in the great set pieces of the final act. The Mariinsky are here for another week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
