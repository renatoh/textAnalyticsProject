It is the most prestigious victory yet for the Isle of Man rider who avoided a final-kilometre crash and held off a late charge from Robert F\u00f6rster of Germany and third-placed Daniele Bennati. The 22-year-old was fortunate not to be involved in the crash, which took out about a dozen riders 800 metres from the line. It appeared to be caused by the rider directly behind Cavendish, Nick Nuyens, with the Belgian touching a wheel and coming down heavily, instigating a domino effect on those around him. In the sprint for the line Cavendish was boxed in but got out and positioned himself behind Bennati, allowing the Italian to lead out before putting in a powerful surge to pass him with time to begin his exuberant celebrations as he crossed the line. \"This is the biggest win of my career,\" said Cavendish. \"A win at the Giro is great for any rider but it makes it even sweeter the way the team worked for me. It was a perfect show of teamwork.\" He had been dropped on the day's final climb, 20km from the finish, but was paced back by his High Road team, which includes Britain's Bradley Wiggins. As the peloton sped towards the end of the 183km-stage Wiggins was prominent among his team who set up the finish for the young sprinter. \"The only thing I could do after that was finish it off with the win.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
