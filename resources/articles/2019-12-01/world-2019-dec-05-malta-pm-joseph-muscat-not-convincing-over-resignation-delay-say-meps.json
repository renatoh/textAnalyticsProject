Yorgen Fenech, who was charged last week for allegedly masterminding the 2017 killing, appeared in court to seek the removal of the police chief leading the case, saying he was too close to Schembri. His testimony in a packed courtroom piled further pressure on Malta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, who has said he will stand down next month after his party elects a new leader. The prime minister is a friend of Schembri, who resigned last week and was briefly arrested in connection with the investigation. He was released without charge and has denied any wrongdoing. Fenech has denied accusations of complicity in the murder and has instead blamed his close friend Schembri, who was Muscat\u2019s righthand man and the architect of his two electoral victories. Fenech said Schembri had passed on information from briefings that the chief investigator, Keith Arnaud, gave at Muscat\u2019s office. This meant he knew swiftly about key developments, including that his own phone had been tapped, Fenech said. Schembri\u2019s lawyer did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Fenech\u2019s testimony. Arnaud made no immediate comment but the police last week issued a statement saying there was no reason for his removal and that the investigation was proving effective. Fenech did not address the murder allegations levelled against him and is due back in court on 10 December. But he said that following his arrest, Schembri managed to pass him notes on two occasions telling him what to say in interrogations. He ignored the advice and instead implicated Schembri. At that point, he said police rushed to charge him and skated over the allegations he was making. \u201cBut all the recordings and evidence link Schembri with the murderers,\u201d he told the court hearing. The self-confessed middleman in the murder, Melvin Theuma, who has been given legal immunity in return for providing evidence, told a court on Wednesday that Fenech was the sole mastermind behind the killing. Caruana Galizia was a campaigning journalist who regularly accused government ministers and business leaders of corruption. On Thursday, a European parliament delegation to the Mediterranean country said the integrity of the murder inquiry remained at risk while Muscat was still in power. Muscat was \u201cnot convincing\u201d over why he should delay his resignation until mid-January, said Sven Giegold, a German Green MEP who took part in a two-day emergency mission to Malta. The European parliament delegation welcomed progress in the murder inquiry but said its integrity remained at risk while Muscat stayed in office. \u201cThe next 40 days will be crucial, also for trust in the integrity of the investigation,\u201d said a statement from the MEPs. Giegold said Muscat told the group he would not be in a position to destroy evidence in the case. The MEP described their encounter this week as \u201cnot a friendly meeting\u201d . Giegold said Muscat seemed quite different to the \u201cvery self-confident\u201d man he recalled from previous meetings. \u201cThis time it was totally different. He was on the defensive. He admitted misjudgment when it came to his chief of staff, Keith Schembri.\u201d Giegold said EU leaders would find themselves in a difficult position if Muscat attended a European council summit next week. \u201cThe decision to stay on for four more weeks puts Malta into difficulty and puts Europe into difficulty, because who wants to shake hands at the Euro summit with this prime minister,\u201d he said. The MEP said Malta\u2019s troubles went beyond the Caruana Galizia case. He also criticised the new European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, for not focusing on wider problems in the EU\u2019s smallest member state.
