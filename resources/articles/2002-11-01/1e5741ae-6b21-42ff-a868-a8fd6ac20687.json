Then you realise there is something missing. Testosterone. Not a whiff. For the 14 walkers having the time of their lives as they push up the somewhat serious slope from Grasmere to Helm Crag are all women. Men tend to walk like they drive - boy racers, eyes fixed on an end point and foot hard on the accelerator - destination-acquisitive. These chilled-out hikers are on a weekend break with WalkingWomen, an organisation offering guided women-only walks that are as much about being there as getting there. The all-inclusive holidays in the Lake District, Scotland, Ireland and abroad cater for every level of walker, from lakeside strollers to high-level hikers. It's a runaway success. \"WalkingWomen is about making wonderful walks accessible to women, taking in the fantastic scenery and enjoying each other's company,\" says founder Diana Clarke. \"It's a nurturing, non-threatening environment where you can challenge yourself as much or as little as you wish.\" Our autumn weekend is being led by Sarah Rycroft, a landscape architect with a passion for the fells. She became one of WalkingWomen's 14 leaders after enjoying three holidays with the group. \"I love the wildlife, the scenery and the weather up here in the Lakes,\" she says. \"It's wonderful to be able to show it to others in a safe, non-competitive set-up and have lots of laughs along the way. It's a joy to see people develop skills they didn't know they had. \"Plenty of women on these holidays have never even been on the fells before. If you live in the Home Counties, for example, you may have no idea how mountainous the Lake District is.\" Sarah, 46, from Manchester, has made many friends through WalkingWomen: \"You get closer to people when you are walking. Women are going to make friends when you've got four or five hours together on a hill. There's something very unifying about being with a group of women, all or most of them strangers. It's great therapy.\" Trish Jones, a 41-year-old supply teacher, has left her husband looking after their four kids on Merseyside, while she takes part in the intermediate-level weekend. \"I had no idea what I was letting myself in for,\" she says. \"I came here with someone I got to know in the school playground. I have never really walked before. The only time I've been this high is on an aircraft.\" The previous day's seven-mile circular walk and 460m ascent in glorious sunshine took her from Grasmere up to Easedale Tarn, across to Blea Rigg and down to Alum Bank. Today, it will be around six miles and 420m of ascent to Helm Crag and across to Gibson Knott. \"I've taken lots of photos to prove where I've been, because no one back home will believe me otherwise,\" says Trish. \"Having no TV in the guesthouse where we are staying and the fact that my mobile doesn't work around here has taken loads of pressure off me. It has been a fantastic experience.\" Conveyancing assistant Pat Herriott, 49, from Reading, is also on her first trip with WalkingWomen. \"I love the camaraderie and laughter,\" she says. \"There's also a willingness to stop and enjoy the space and being with each other. The group has bonded so well. It's wonderful, such a beautiful place.\" Pat says the weekend has given her a great sense of personal satisfaction. \"I've pushed myself and succeeded. That means a lot to me.\" She has also enjoyed evenings with the group, which involves rooming at Glenthorne, a comfortable guest house, with breakfast, evening meal and a packed lunch included in the \u00a3135 cost of the holiday. Saturday evening was spent chatting in the pub or, for a few, enjoying a quiet walk alone. Diana Clarke set up WalkingWomen just 2 years ago. \"I was a homeopath and burning out,\" she says. \"I needed a change. I loved walking in the Lakes, but work commitments in Denmark had kept me off the fells. I couldn't afford to buy somewhere to live up there, so I decided to build walking into a change of career. \"It has grown faster than I imagined, although last year's foot-and-mouth crisis caused a major panic initially. We had to switch one holiday from the Lakes to Italy at short notice, but it made me realise how easy it would be to extend our range of holidays abroad.\" Clarke says the women on the holidays come from a huge range of backgrounds and are aged between 16 and 80: \"Ninety percent are here on their own. On one trip, there was a former policewoman, some ex-Greenham women, a couple of social workers and a croupier,\" she says. Next year, WalkingWomen will offer close to 60 trips at home and abroad, including four new destinations - Namibia, Mont Blanc, Bavaria and the south of France. There are special-interest holidays such as photography, navigation on the hills and a week's skiing in La Plagne in France. Accommodation varies from comfortable inns and guesthouses to more basic but well-run youth hostels. Other Lake District locations include Patterdale, Buttermere and Langdale. One five-night high-level trek starting at Borrowdale and staying in B&amp;Bs en route offers Great Gable, Scafell Pike, Bow Fell and the Langdale Pikes. \u00b7 WalkingWomen, 22 Duke St, Leamington Spa, Warwicks CV32 4TR. 01926 313321, walkingwomen.com.
