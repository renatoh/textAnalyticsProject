At the London branch of Supreme, the cult skatewear firm driving this trend, its weekly Thursday collection drops have resulted in three-person-deep queues snaking around surrounding streets, while the desperation to bag an item once inside could lead to scuffles and queue jumping. The lines became so raucous that Westminster council threatened Supreme with closure, resulting in the introduction last year of a new ticketing system, which shoppers must sign up to for a chance to enter the shop on drop day. As a result, its highly anticipated collaboration with the Japanese streetwear label Undercover and US hip-hop group Public Enemy, featuring the artwork from the band\u2019s 1990 album Fear of A Black Planet, went on sale on Thursday in a positively orderly fashion. Four hundred pre-registered shoppers were allocated a time slot between 11am and 6pm to attend the Soho shop. Early arrivals were directed to a holding area out of sight down the street, to be escorted, at 11am, with passports checked and cross-referenced, in small groups to stand outside the shop, where mobile phones were not permitted. Shortly afterwards, seven people at a time were allowed inside, with up to 15 minutes to peruse and purchase. Outside the understated black shop facade, anyone who was seen to be dawdling \u2013 inquisitive tourists included \u2013 were moved along by a coordinated team of security guards. The aim of the strategy, a Supreme employee explained, was to give fans what they wanted without diluting the spirit of the drop which, with its top-secret meetings to get tickets, has become a sub-culture of its own among devotees of the brand. \u201cThe level of fervour surrounding \u2019preme has grown exponentially of late, so the complicated method of obtaining access to a drop definitely makes it more covetable to newcomers,\u201d said Byron Hawes, author of the forthcoming book Drop, which documents the culture around the launches. \u201cSupreme\u2019s hype game is so strong that nothing can truly dampen it. The general feeling of hype, community, and camaraderie remains.\u201d Loyal shoppers arriving for Thursday\u2019s drop expressed mixed views. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier and a lot more difficult,\u201d said 19-year-old Victor Chapman, a Supreme fan since he was 13 who used to camp outside the store before the new system was introduced. \u201cIf you were camping, you would just get there early and get in and get what you wanted, and now you have to get your ticket or you can\u2019t go in.\u201d The system has helped curb the infamous resale market, with some people buying in store and then selling at inflated prices on the internet. \u201cBig drops gather a lot of attention from resellers and it\u2019s especially worse with sneakers,\u201d said 18-year-old Jiajia Hang, who spent about \u00a3400 at Thursday\u2019s launch. \u201cPeople would come to drops and push in to try and get a pair, but with this line-up system, that sort of stuff doesn\u2019t happen any more.\u201d Hawes recounted rumours that Supreme attempts to counter the resale market by tracking resellers who, when they try to get tickets to drops are \u201cgiven \u2018sucka numbers\u2019, which are late in the day and won\u2019t allow admittance to the shop at all\u201d. Supreme\u2019s ticketed queuing did, however, jar with long-time fans, said Hawes. \u201cOld heads have been hustling for ages, so it doesn\u2019t really change their opinions, although I\u2019ve spoken with lots of cats who\u2019ve collected for years, and now feel that Supreme is over, what with all the suburbanite hype.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
