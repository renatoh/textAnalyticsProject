That happened last October, in a horrifying multi-car crash during a race in Las Vegas; the images of his machine were prominently featured in the British mass media, which had barely bothered to mention his two wins in the Indianapolis 500, America's biggest motor race. Not much space was devoted on Monday to reporting a third win in the Indy 500 for Dario Franchitti, the Scottish driver who was among Wheldon's closest friends. It was not always so. Early attempts by British cars and drivers to win at Indy were given large amounts of publicity, particularly in 1965, when Jim Clark became the first non-American to capture the race, earning a distinction he holds to this day: that of being the only man to win the legendary 500 and the Formula One world championship in the same season. Clark had conquered a citadel of American sport, and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was never quite the same again. Not that you would know from its enduring and sometimes eccentric rituals. They still hold the race on Memorial Day weekend, pork tenderloin sandwiches are still sold at the food stalls, the Purdue University Marching Band parades in front of the start-line grandstand (segueing from Stars and Stripes Forever into Louie Louie the last time I was there), a guest sings The Star-Spangled Banner, a local clergyman says a prayer for the drivers' safety, US military aircraft swoop down the main straight in tight formation, the veteran singer Jim Nabors performs Back Home Again In Indiana and the wife of the speedway owner utters the celebrated command: \"Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.\" But it is now seven years since a US driver won a race in which home-produced competitors triumphed without a break between the first edition in 1911, when Ray Harroun won in his locally built Marmon Wasp (creating a stir by using a rear-view mirror instead of relying on the then-customary riding mechanic) and 1964 when A J Foyt secured the last victory for the traditional front-engined \"roadsters\" before the invasion of British-built rear-engined lightweight machines swept them away. This does not seem to have cooled the ardour of the fans, who throng to the speedway in their hundreds of thousands on race day and are as happy to acclaim an Australian or a Frenchman as they are to cheer on a fellow American from Ohio or Pennsylvania. Most interestingly they have never had a problem accepting women competitors, starting with Janet Guthrie in 1977 and including Danica Patrick, who in 2005 became the first woman to lead the race. On Sunday there were three female drivers on the grid, each having qualified at an average speed of more than 200mph: Ana Beatriz of Brazil, Simona de Silvestro of Switzerland and Katherine Legge of Guildford, Surrey. This makes a striking contrast with Formula One, in which no woman has started a grand prix since 1976. Here is another contrast: this year's race featured more than 30 changes of lead, breaking a record going all the way back to 1960. Franchitti, the winner, moved to America 15 years ago after working his way up through the ranks in European racing but not quite managing to make it into Formula One. Sunday's victory followed wins in 2007 and 2010 and was certainly the most eventful, given that at one point he found himself lying 28th in a field of 33 cars after being hit from behind by the accident-prone Venezuelan driver E J Viso while making an early pit stop and finding himself facing the wrong direction in the middle of the pit lane. Having worked his way back up the field, he was challenged for the lead in the final stages by Takuma Sato, the erstwhile Formula One driver, who tried to dive inside Franchitti at the start of the last lap but discovered there was not enough room to get through and lost control, slewing across the track and hitting the wall. With the yellow caution flags out, Franchitti cruised to the chequered flag in the close company of his team-mate, Scott Dixon, and the third-placed driver, Tony Kanaan. Clark is his hero and I suspect that his successes at Indy more than make up for his failure to scale the heights of F1. Fittingly the trio on the podium were all particular friends of the popular Wheldon. Franchitti dedicated the win to his fellow Brit and lost no time in putting on a pair of the white-framed sunglasses that were Wheldon's trademark, replicas of which had also been handed out to the spectators earlier in the day. The winner and his wife, the Hollywood actress Ashley Judd, were joined by Wheldon's widow, Susie, on their victory parade. Several hours after her husband had crossed the finish line, Judd tweeted a photograph of the deserted speedway, taken from above the pits, with the last rays of the setting sun fading in the sky over Turn Four and not a soul in sight. \"I swear this track is a living, breathing thing,\" she remarked. Indianapolis can be a raucous place, in which the pretty people who thronged the paddock at Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix would not feel at home, and it can be lethal, too, but it has a poetry of its own. richard.williams@theguardian.com twitter.com/rwilliams1947"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
