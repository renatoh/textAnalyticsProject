An examination of CCTV showed the plastic bottle had been thrown by a pupil from a school \"on the other side of the country\", according to a Gloucester spokesman, who on Wednesday said the club had also received complains about \"the behaviour of a very small minority of supporters \u2026 in particular, the use of foul and abusive language towards the match officials.\" He added: \"The club's stance on these matters is quite clear. The following are strictly forbidden \u2013 use of foul and abusive language, obscene chanting or racial abuse towards any person.\" The club, who could still be subject to RFU sanction, said they had also studied the CCTV regarding the abuse of officials and were \"now liaising with the relevant authorities to determine an appropriate course of action\". At their final home game of the regular season, against London Irish, 10,000 cards will be handed out saying: \"I am part of the rugby family.\" \"Gloucester Rugby is rightly proud of the passionate and committed support that it receives week in and week out from its supporters, the vast majority of whom always respect and abide by the values of the game,\" the spokesman said. \"However, it also accepts that a very small minority crossed the line at the Bath game and behaved in an unacceptable manner. This simply cannot be condoned.\" In future, supporters will be asked to report similar incidents to club stewards. \"The club will take the strongest possible action against the very small number of individuals who bring the club's name into disrepute by their actions.\" The Wales scrum-half Tavis Knoyle, who is joining Cardiff Blues in the summer, has been suspended for a month for punching the Bath No 8 Leroy Houston during Saturday's derby. The ban will mark the end of his season unless Gloucester make the play-off for the final place in the European Rugby Champions Cup. Knoyle was sent off, as was the club's prop Sila Puafisi who felled Nick Abendanon with a high and dangerous tackle. He was suspended for a week at the same disciplinary hearing in London and will miss Saturday's clash with Wasps at Twickenham. Meanwhile, Dan Carter believes Stuart Lancaster has whipped England into genuine contenders for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The New Zealand fly-half is on a six-month sabbatical and is set to miss the three-match series against England in June but expects it to be an important stepping stone on the road to next year's tournament. \"It's going to be a great Test series, they are building momentum and getting a strong squad together and building a lot of confidence,\" he said. \"I'm sure they'll love to challenge themselves against the best around, they are right up there and they are looking forward to coming down and playing us. Having a win there would add a lot of confidence to the direction that they are moving, so there'll be a lot of hype and excitement that will make for a great Test series in June.\" Carter capped a three-week world tour by booting rugby balls off a barge on the river Thames in the shadow of Tower Bridge. After a whistle-stop tour of the United States and Europe, Carter will now return to New Zealand to fight to return to full fitness in July after an achilles problem. Tipping England as one of title-holders New Zealand's main World Cup threats in 2015, Carter admitted he has relished a chance to refresh as much mentally as physically during his planned sabbatical. \"It's been great to have this break, but now I've got to go home and work extremely hard to make sure I'm part of the All Blacks team that defends the trophy here next year,\" he said. \"I've been working hard on getting on top of a few injuries and niggles I've had for the last few years, and just freshening up mentally. The end goal is definitely worth it, to be here at the World Cup for the All Blacks.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
