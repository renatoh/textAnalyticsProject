The court also used its ruling to push back at accusations that its role in assessing the constitutionality of laws was an affront to Beijing. The judgment, delivered on Thursday afternoon, said Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive could use colonial-era laws to make emergency decrees for public safety and that banning masks was constitutional at unlawful gatherings. But it also found that banning masks at lawful gatherings and allowing police to demand their removal was unconstitutional. Hong Kong\u2019s mask ban was introduced in October as widespread protests in the city grew increasingly violent. The chief executive, Carrie Lam, invoked the colonial-era emergency regulations ordinance (ERO), categorising the protests as a state of \u201cpublic danger\u201d, to ban the wearing of masks at both lawful and unlawful assemblies. \u201cThe violence and damage are mostly caused by protesters wearing masks and dressed in black outfits,\u201d said Thursday\u2019s court judgment. \u201cAt the same time, it is a common phenomenon that many other protesters participating in public assemblies and processions who are not involved in violence are also wearing masks and dressed in black outfits.\u201d The judgment said there was \u201cnothing objectionable\u201d in Lam having the power to determine whether a public danger existed, and the chief executive was \u201cevidently the only suitable person to make the call\u201d. \u201cThat said, it does not follow that the CE could act freely without any rein as she wishes,\u201d it added. The court found the mask ban, which indisputably \u201cimposed restrictions on fundamental rights\u201d, did not meet standards of proportionality in applying to lawful gatherings, and noted the risk to bystanders or people who joined a lawful rally and did not realise when authorisation had been revoked. \u201c[A] total ban of facial coverings from all public demonstrations, processions and gatherings cannot pass the test of reasonable necessity even in the context of the public danger in which the [anti-mask law] is meant to address,\u201d the judgment said. It added that police already had powers to seek identification of suspects, and found the powers granted to police to physically remove masks was unconstitutional. Speaking outside court, one activist, Leung Kwok-hung, popularly known as \u201cLong Hair\u201d, said he was disappointed with the ruling, the South China Morning Post reported. \u201cThe definition of \u2018public danger\u2019 is too wide, it will allow the chief executive to abuse his or her power in order to avoid ordinary people from exercising their basic rights such as freedom of assembly or freedom of speech,\u201d he said. The mask ban in October prompted further protests as well as legal challenges by pro-democracy legislators, and in November the high court ruled the ban and the use of the ERO was unconstitutional, a decision that angered Beijing. Under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework, the city is meant to enjoy semi-autonomy from China until 2047. \u201cWhether Hong Kong\u2019s laws are consistent with the Basic Law can only be judged and decided by the [National People\u2019s Congress standing committee],\u201d said Zang Tiewei, the spokesman for the committee, which is China\u2019s top legislative body. \u201cNo other authority has the right to make judgments and decisions.\u201d However, in Thursday\u2019s ruling the court appeared to defend itself against this charge. It said laws could be adopted and later found to be in contravention of the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, which does not \u201cin any way diminish the authority of the NPCSC\u2019s decision\u201d. There were 632 people arrested under the law, but only three were arrested solely in relation to that offence. Sixty-one were charged. The maximum penalty is one year in prison or a fine of HK$25,000 (\u00a32,600). Since the coronavirus pandemic took hold the law has been criticised for contradicting public health measures. Hong Kong, like many other Asian cities, embraces the use of masks to prevent the spread of disease. This week health experts called for the wearing of masks to become mandatory in Hong Kong. Ho Pak-leung, a microbiologist at Hong Kong University, told local radio masks were effective to an extent, and that some infection clusters may have been related to people not wearing masks. Ahead of the ruling legal academics called for the Hong Kong government to repeal the law regardless of the outcome, to avoid confusion that could put people\u2019s health at risk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
