Gillett died on 18 July 2005, when she was struck by a teenage driver while training in Germany with the Australian cycling squad. If Duncan Gay has seen those posters, however, he has not let it affect his views. Gay, a member of the junior party in the Liberal-National coalition, is minister for roads for New South Wales, and has described himself as \u201cthe biggest bike-lane sceptic in the government\u201d. The NSW government is about to get rid of a much-loved and much-used AU$5m (\u00a32.4m) protected cycleway in Sydney\u2019s city centre \u2013 a move Clover Moore, lord mayor of Sydney since 2004, describes as \u201ca shocking breach of trust\u201d. Gay\u2019s move seems to go against the flow, with cycling increasingly feted as a potential congestion and pollution game changer in major cities around the world. Take the segregated bike lanes currently under construction in the centre of London, for example, or the introduction of protected cycleways in New York, where pedestrian and cyclist injuries are down and traffic is moving quicker. But he is not alone. Earlier this year Gainesville, Florida, returned bike lanes to cars on a 1.6km stretch, resulting in cyclists moving to the pavement. In San Antonio, Texas, the city council removed 3.7km of bike lanes, which the local Express-News paper described as \u201ca failure of leadership from council\u201d. And, in Toronto, the colourful former mayor Rob Ford oversaw the removal of bike lanes at a cost of CA$300,000 (\u00a3147,000). Stephen Hodge, a former professional cyclist who now works for Australia\u2019s Cycling Promotion Fund, says the decision will put cyclists at greater risk. \u201cThe one unifying measure everyone agrees on, that has been shown to increase both perception and actual safety of cycling, is infrastructure such as cycleways,\u201d he said. \u201cDuncan Gay is a hero to Nationals for breaking through barriers. By hook or by crook he has got his mind fixed on [removing the College Street cycleway], so he\u2019ll do it.\u201d \u201cThe government\u2019s own city centre access strategy, the blueprint to unclog our congested streets, has a target of doubling the number of bike trips in Sydney by 2016,\u201d said Moore. \u201cRipping up cycleways will send Sydney in the wrong direction. We won\u2019t get the results everyone agrees Sydney needs without a network of safe, separated cycleways \u2026 [which] are essential for fixing congestion in the [city] and protecting people who choose to ride.\u201d The chief-executive of Bicycle NSW, Ray Rice, says the NSW government\u2019s move is bad for motorists as well as cyclists. \u201cThey are saying over 2,200 riders per day will have to use other paths, but they are not providing them. Riders are going to continue to use College Street, but mixed in with traffic. That\u2019s not safe: it\u2019s going to hold up the cars and it\u2019s going to piss everybody off. It\u2019s an incredibly bad message. Gay is prioritising cars over active transport \u2013 bikes and walking.\u201d Sue Abbott, a cycling advocate who pays her own way to international conferences on the benefits of bicycles, does not mince her words: \u201cGay wants to destroy cycling in Sydney,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you go to conferences such as Velo-city, we are completely backwards. Not just a couple of years \u2013 we\u2019re a couple of decades backwards. \u201cAt the conference, you listen to other city leaders; whether they are engineers or in politics or urban design, they\u2019re all talking about looking at the bicycle, looking at public transport. Basically, the car is history and the rest of world is getting it. But, in Sydney, we have Duncan Gay running our show.\u201d British cycling journalist Simon Withers has personal experience of how dangerous Sydney can be for cyclists. \u201cThe roads are geared for the motor vehicle at the expense of cyclists and pedestrians,\u201d he said. \u201cI was injured \u2013 I broke a finger \u2013 when I was hit by a car door in Oxford Street [in Sydney\u2019s city centre], which wouldn\u2019t have happened in the UK. In Britain, I would have been cycling further into the centre of the lane, where you\u2019re safest, but Australian drivers overtake so closely. \u201cBritish drivers aren\u2019t great by any stretch of the imagination, but I believe Australian drivers are even more aggressive when it comes to cyclists. Sydney is borderline terrifying, and that\u2019s from somebody who has cycled all over the world. It\u2019s not much better than Kuala Lumpur or Los Angeles, which is an indictment in itself,\u201d said Withers. Moore says the NSW government is on the wrong side of history. \u201cData shows young people are buying fewer cars and driving less, and so it makes sense to support other options, including cycling. Cycling as a chosen mode of transport is rapidly increasing. We need to support people\u2019s decision to ride rather than simply looking out for people who choose to sit behind the wheel,\u201d she said. \u201cThe value of cycling in Sydney has been undermined by hysterical claims that bike riding will cripple the city\u2019s economy, misleading stories that distort data to proclaim that less people are riding, and wilful ignorance of good practice overseas.\u201d Cycleway wars are being fought city by city around the world, but the situation in Sydney seems unlikely to improve under the current NSW minister for roads.
