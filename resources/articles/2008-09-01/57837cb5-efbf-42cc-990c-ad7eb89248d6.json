But yesterday's edition, which discussed secret government papers from 1974 on the future of Northern Ireland, really did crackle with the discovery of something special. To give you an idea of the gasp-value; the manuscript was known as The Doomsday Document and described as \"more or less a scream of rage\". It was also almost exclusively the work of then prime minister Harold Wilson. The doom-laden scenario Wilson anticipated was the failure of the Sunningdale Power-sharing Executive. Wilson, the documents revealed, had drawn up plans to hand the province to the Irish Republic. \"Harold Wilson,\" Thomson said with relish, \"was secretly preparing to cast it adrift, chopping off Ireland from the rest of the UK.\" One commentator described these plans - known only to a teensy committee at the time - as \"flaky\", and civil war was mooted as a likely response. Events ultimately led another way, but this was a gripping, hush-hush moment in our recent past. How different things might have been."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
