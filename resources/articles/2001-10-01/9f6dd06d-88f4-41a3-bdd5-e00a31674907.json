For well over half a century, an extremely faithful group of subscribers has attended concerts by string quartets from across the world. For this audience the Sorrel Quartet are established favourites, not just because they trained locally but also because they represent a special kind of vibrancy among the country's younger quartets. They were an obvious and strong choice to open the new season. In Frank Bridge's Three Idylls, from 1906, they showed why. At the gentle start they showed restraint and a warmth of texture that prepared well for the more excited music to come. They highlighted the ways in which Bridge is both a connoisseur's composer, and one whose music belongs alongside the famous works of Debussy and Ravel. His music needs careful presentation, which it received. Shostakovich's Second Quartet showed them in an entirely different mood. They launched into its almost Baroque-sounding overture with an anguished excitement that vividly placed the work in the last years of the second world war. Whether that was the best way to play the quartet's most famous movement, the bizarre Recitative and Romance, is a matter of opinion. Gina McCormack played the Recitative line with a boldness that left much to chance; its folk-music roots, however, need a more precise kind of intonation against the held chords in the lower instruments. She recovered much in a beguiling, fluent performance of the contrasting Romance. For the Brahms Clarinet Quintet they drew on the long experience of David Campbell, with slightly odd results. Any combination of an established group with an outside player has its musical consequences, often positive. But here Campbell seemed to be deferring too much to the quartet, and they to him. The playing here seemed too safe. There were moments at the start of the slow movement where the music began to catch fire, but then safety seemed to take over again: a search for precision rather than fantasy. That is something that can never be predicted; but this time the fire just failed to ignite."}, "isHosted": false}}}
