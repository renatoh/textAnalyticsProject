It's media shorthand, a euphemism for a failed suicide attempt, or a headlong plunge into drink or drugs that has slipped into common usage. It's also a phrase that often seems only to be used in retrospect, when it is realised that an earlier signal has gone unheeded. On last week's thread, there was an interesting diversion to discuss music made by people whose own lives were desperate and how that fact may or may not have permeated their music. Do we hear cries for help where there were none? Or are we only able to find them once we know where to look? Surely no one can listen to Joy Division without the fate of Ian Curtis passing through their mind. And that must affect our reaction to the songs. There is an ambivalence in New Dawn Fades, a numbness that is perhaps its own desperation. But when Curtis sings \"A loaded gun won't set you free/ So you say\" with the second line lilting upwards, it is difficult not to imagine a curl of the lip. Patti Smith's Fireflies shares a quiet anguish. It is slow, fragmented and full of echoes. The lyrics offer up religious imagery that seems to equate the trials of a relationship to a pilgrimage. The destination never seems as if it will be salvation, though, and the desperation lies in the determination to continue. Where Do We Go But Nowhere has desperation in its title and horror in its lines (\"Ravaged avenger with a clip in your hair/ Full of glass and bleach an my old razor blades\") but it is twinned with a delicate, beautiful melody that sells your ears a dummy. You have to listen closely to glean the song's true sentiments. Grudge Fuck is similarly two-faced; there's an obvious sexual desperation, but also a darker plot that unfolds as the apparently stoned and feckless narrator imagines controlling his former lover. The remainder of this list is more explicit in its desperation. Lorraine Ellison and Harold Melvin make plain in their voices the strength of their feelings. Elllison's performance is extraordinary. While the sentiments may be familiar, the performance certainly is not, coming in somewhere between a song and a ululation. Van Morrison may not quite match up in terms of intensity, but Them's famous plea to a departing lover does have the benefit of being backed by an awesome groove. In With or Without You, it's the dramatic qualities of the song \u2013 the phrasing, the structure, the guitar line \u2013 that make it stand out. The Bee Gees' entry is an unexpected three minutes of soul full of preachers and forlorn love that one might more naturally be associated with an Aretha or Dusty. There's no falsetto, but what there is is a melodic tenderness that claws at the heart. The falsetto, ultimately, is left to Skip James, who also displays some virtuoso finger-picking in a blues song that is non-traditional in everything apart from the desperate misery.
