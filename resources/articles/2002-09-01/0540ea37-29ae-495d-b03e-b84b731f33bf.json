In fact, as this week's UEFA decision to give ITV and Sky the rights to Champions League soccer for the next three years showed, reports of ITV's demise are premature. Airey's decision to duck the ITV challenge for a job at Sky - without any control over Sky Sports or Sky News - says as much about her own horizons as the plight of ITV. More importantly, that story relegated to the margins the equally significant news of Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell's strings-attached approval of BBC3, the last piece of the BBC's digital jigsaw puzzle which will target the nation's 'yoof'. The new channel, and Jowell's conditions, raise some interesting questions about how we'll know whether BBC3 is doing its job - and who decides. Coincidentally, in the latest book of essays just published by the Independent Television Commission, ex-BBC producer and journalist David Aaronovitch talks about the 'culturally separate attitude' of young people to TV. He illustrates this with an enjoyably graphic description of nudity, threesomes, and 15-times-a-week sex on ITV's Club Reps and Club Reps Uncut. This sort of stuff is meat and drink (especially drink) to the 18-30 generation, and is almost bound to antagonise the wrinklies if it is to have any street cred among its target audience. In order to succeed, BBC3 may not want to commission Club Reps Revisited but it will have to push the boundaries of conventional programming and be 'edgy'. There starts the big conundrum for the channel's controller, Stuart Murphy. Not only must he find a way of reaching a healthy chunk of youngsters who aren't great telly fans anyway, but he simultaneously has to abide by the most detailed quantified conditions ever imposed by a government minister on a BBC service. Apart from the usual quality, diversity and innovation strictures, there are obligations to commission 25 per cent of programming from independents; a 10 per cent cap on non-European (ie American) imports; a requirement to commission 80 per cent of output specifically for BBC3; and a ban on competing for 'well-established' foreign talent. Is Auntie being tied too closely for comfort to the government's apron strings? Is this the final proof that the BBC should be swept lock, stock and BBC3 under the umbrella of Ofcom - for its own protection. It's a tempting argument, but wrong for three reasons. First, most of the measurable conditions in Tessa Jowell's schedule fall within the 'tier 2' category of regulation which will be monitored by Ofcom anyway. The BBC's quotas of independent production, regional production and home-grown programming will all be subject to Ofcom scrutiny. It is only the less quantifiable areas of innovation, quality and diversity which are left to the discretion of the governors and ultimately the Secretary of State. Second, anyone who believes the BBC is a fragile flower that will wilt under the slightest whiff of ministerial disapproval doesn't understand the BBC's history and hasn't read Richard Lindley's book on Panorama . Unless it becomes paralysed by self-censorship, the BBC is quite capable of standing up to Ms Jowell and any successors who try to impose politically motivated judgments. Finally, the consequences of an Ofcom-run BBC will be programming decisions passed on the basis of what suits the BBC's commercial competitors. Remember that Ofcom will be fuelling the drive towards 'the most dynamic and competitive communications and media market in the world'. That doesn't bode well for a public sector driven by cultural rather than commercial demands. In the end, it comes down to this. If Club Reps emerged out of Murphy's BBC3, who would decide whether this was an unprincipled exercise in ratings-grabbing voyeurism or a masterly portrait of the rampant nihilism infecting today's youth? My bet is that any Secretary of State who attempted to damn BBC3 programmes on the subjective grounds that they weren't sufficiently innovative or distinctive would find themselves dragged into an unwinnable debate on the nature of artistic merit. Ministers, thankfully, have better things to do and will be very happy to leave matters to the BBC governors. \u00b7 Steven Barnett is professor of communications at the University of Westminster"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
