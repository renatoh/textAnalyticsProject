The Guardian poll, published on Thursday 26 August, lists the top ten science fiction films and authors as voted for by our panel of eminent scientists, who also reveal how they have been influenced by such works. \"Bladerunner is the best movie ever made,\" says Stephen Minger, stem cell biologist at King's College. \"It was so far ahead of its time and the whole premise of the story - what is it to be human and who are we, where we come from? It's the age old questions.\" 2001: A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick's 1968 epic masterpiece, comes in at a very close second, followed by the first two films of the Star Wars trilogy, Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. Isaac Asimov tops the poll of science fiction authors for I, Robot, and the Foundation trilogy. He's followed closely by John Wyndham for, among other works, his 1951 novel, The Day of The Triffids. Fred Hoyle comes in third for The Black Cloud. The top tens were voted for by a panel of sixty scientists including Richard Dawkins, evolutionary biologist, Oxford University; Steven Pinker, psychologist, Harvard; Steven Rose, neuroscientist, Open University and Steve Jones, geneticist, UCL.
