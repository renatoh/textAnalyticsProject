While a coronation for Vladimir Putin and the possibility of a run-off between Nicolas Sarkozy and Marine Le Pen is hardly a prospect to savour, the US contest could be a rare source of political good cheer in 2012. On paper it should be anything but. Barack Obama has disappointed those who had such high hopes back in 2008. The US economy has limped under him and he has proved a more hesitant figure than he promised. By rights, he should be vulnerable in November. And yet few would bet against him winning a second term \u2013 becoming, incredibly, only the eighth Democrat in US history to achieve such a feat. The explanation lies partly in his own record: he will have made good on his promise to wind up the war in Iraq and he achieved what eluded his predecessor, capturing and killing Osama bin Laden. But if Obama wins, it will be due less to his strengths than to the weakness of his opponents. For the Republicans appear to lack a candidate with enough popular appeal to defeat even the relatively unpopular Obama. The likes of Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry or Rick Santorum have just too many negatives to be electable. Frontrunner Mitt Romney, meanwhile, suffers from John Kerry/Al Gore syndrome: good CV, but lacking human warmth or likability. Romney struggles to enthuse his own party, let alone the country. And so, whatever else it might throw at us, 2012's travails are unlikely to include the removal of a US president who \u2013 however flawed \u2013 is still a voice of sanity. That's a blessing worth counting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
