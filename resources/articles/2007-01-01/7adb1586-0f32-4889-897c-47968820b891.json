Deicide means \"the killing of deities\" - controversy follows the band around. Singer Glen Benton caused outrage by branding his forehead with an upside-down cross. They are banned in Chile after fans desecrated a church, and Deicide's audiences have been known to lose control of their bowels. Alas, or to the joy of local church-goers, Benton has been detained by an American court, which is presumably an occupational hazard. He's replaced by Polish grunter Garbaty Yaha, who presumably invoked infernal assistance to learn 17 songs in a day. Even minus their singing great beast, Deicide still unleash a fearsome, cathartic noise, a purging purgatory so relentlessly heavy it's almost symphonic. Yaha's grunts make the songs sound like Bavarian drinking anthems performed by trolls. However, despite the fact that their latest album rejoices in the title of The Stench of Redemption, it doesn't sound obviously satanic. In fact, Deicide's demonic credibility took a lightning bolt recently after they recruited guitarist Ralph Santolla, a self-confessed Catholic more interested in 100mph solos than sacrificing babies. He does look nervous when someone shouts \"Kill Christians!\", although this turns out to be a song title. Rather than every parent's nightmare, the band are really family entertainers who invite fans up for \"karaoke Deicide\". On leaving the stage after grunting with his heroes, one hairy young chap informs us that he is available for \"weddings, funerals and bar mitzvahs.\" What, no satanic rites? \u00b7 At Glasgow Cathouse, tonight (0141-248 6606), and touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
