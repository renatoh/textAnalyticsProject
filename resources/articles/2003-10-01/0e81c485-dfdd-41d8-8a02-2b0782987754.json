Delving into the velvet bag he would pluck out a ball that was twice the size of any of the others and announce that the Ibrox club were at home to Gala Fairydean. Nowadays, he really is responsible for Rangers' fate and it is far harder to rig matters with Manchester United visiting tomorrow. McLeish is deeply conscious of the honour of holding his post at a club with such a heritage, yet the joke about the cup draw is indicative of a man who can also laugh at the pre-eminence of the Old Firm in Scottish football. He has a broad range of experience and, more importantly, has analysed every piece of it. Alex Ferguson, the manager when he and Willie Miller were the cornerstone of the Aberdeen side that beat Real Madrid to win the Cup Winners' Cup in 1983, calls McLeish \"hugely inquisitive\". That hunger for information serves him in the hunt for trophies. McLeish has an adaptable mind. Whether passing maths as a schoolboy at the Scottish equivalent of A level, furthering his enthusiasm for cinema, with a particular concern for Humphrey Bogart movies, reading extensively, recalling the names, faces and life stories of fans he met briefly, or assimilating information on teams around Europe, there is an unquenchable curiosity. This manager has never let conceit restrict him. He made 77 appearances for Scotland but, bruisingly, Andy Roxburgh dropped him from the squad in 1987 just as the landmark 50th cap was approaching. Another player would have seethed and sulked but Craig Brown, then Roxburgh's assistant, knew he could still count on McLeish's maturity. \"I wanted to pick him for the Under-21s, because we were allowed an over-age player in those days,\" said Brown. \"Andy told me not to be daft and that it would be an insult, but I thought Alex would be amenable if I was asking him for help. He agreed without hesitation and he steered all the young lads through our game with Ireland brilliantly.\" McLeish was unperturbed to be back among the colts then, and there has been a patient quality about his career. He was in charge of Motherwell and then Hibernian for a total of seven years before he was given the job at Rangers. The impression in that period was not of a managerial prodigy, but of a man improving gradually. Earning the Ibrox job confounded contemporary logic since a lack of resources at Scottish clubs outside the Old Firm makes it all but impossible for a person to prove their worth. Although McLeish had enjoyed a spell of sustained progress at Hibs, his side had not won a league game for almost two months when Rangers appointed him in December 2001. Dick Advocaat had stepped aside at Ibrox to become technical director for a brief period and many fans viewed McLeish as an unsatisfactory, cut-price replacement. His first match was against Hibs at Ibrox and there was a studied refusal by the crowd to make any particular acknowledgement of his arrival. McLeish, though, understood and met it with a mix of humility and assertiveness. \"I don't come here as a Ferguson, a [Louis] Van Gaal or an Advocaat, but I do come full of ambition,\" he said. \"And I'll do it my own way.\" Although that 2001-02 league title was beyond Rangers by then, McLeish has since gone on to win all five domestic honours open to him, including the treble last season. Considering Martin O'Neill's potent work at Celtic, it has been a fine achievement. The endless references to the calls he makes to Ferguson are a slight on McLeish. The aplomb he has shown cannot be poured down a telephone line. McLeish's maturity was evident on Sunday as he restrained himself from scorning his team for the 1-1 draw at Motherwell. Knowing that the match with United was impending, he did not take the risk of undermining confidence. Two years ago, in a similar situation, Advocaat ranted idiosyncratically about \"fatnecks\" who spent too much time on the internet and the golf course. His players reacted with a ruinous performance against Sturm Graz. \"Alex will always have team-spirit at any club he manages,\" said Brown. \"He has that gregarious, arm-round-the-shoulder manner that gets players together. His predecessor was the opposite.\" McLeish has created a positive mood, but a man who has picked his way forward carefully has to decide which step he should next take. Rangers had been run so irresponsibly that they now carry a \u00a365m debt and have sold players such as Barry Ferguson. Although McLeish has extended his contract until 2007, he would be unwise to remain if, with Celtic seemingly in the ascendant, circumstances threaten to defeat him. \"His name is recognised around Europe by the people who know football,\" said his old Aberdeen team-mate Miller. \"There are still huge opportunities for him, bigger than Rangers. I don't think Alex would see himself being out of place managing in Europe, rather than England.\" If McLeish has ambitions beyond Ibrox, though, a good display against Manchester United on Glasgow soil would further them significantly.
