Canada's 9-8 victory over Denmark handed the Canadians the fourth and final spot in the semi-finals and rendered the result of Martin's final round-robin match irrelevant. Skip Rhona Martin had almost half an hour to dream of a great escape having saved her most emphatic win of the competition for the final day, easing past her inexperienced opponents with four ends to spare. But while she watched the already eliminated Danes put up a brave fight in a topsy-turvy tussle, the favoured Canadians gradually got on top and secured victory with the final stone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
