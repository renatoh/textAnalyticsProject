The Arches' weekly Octopussy nights offer just about everything a hedonistic Mediterranean resort can provide, including a swimming pool and Jacuzzi, a bouncy castle, a casino (useful for that student loan), laser quest games, Elvis lookalikes and even a wedding chapel. Cheap drinks and funky house, chart and R&amp;B music ensure big smiles all round. Bloody students, don't know they're born. Patric Baird \u00b7 The Arches, Argyle Street, Wed 28 The International Amalgamation Of Champions London Real Gold are the sprightly, self-styled saviours of the London party scene, a collective with more bounce than a bucket full of Andrex puppies, and just as cute. Mixing it up in the way that only young urbanites know how, they stick two fingers up to genre restrictions and instead embrace eight hour stints of mashed-up mentalism. Tonight is in part the launch party for Real Gold partners in crime, Team Mega Mix's limited edition mixtape, a gay disco and grime hodgepodge that you can buy on the door for an extra \u00a34 on your ticket fee. Elsewhere, there's live action from electro-popper and Aphex Twin's best mate, DMX Krew, as well as Dev ex-Test Icicle debuting his solo hip-hop project, Nigga Bullshit. More DJ goodness comes in the shape of Vice mag's grime evangelist Prancehall, Young And Lost Records' Nadia and Sara, plus crunk and punk sounds from Mo Problems and 1990s Britpop from Ronojoy Dam. Leonie Cooper \u00b7 Corsica Studios, Unit Two, SE17, Fri 30 Swap-a-Rama Razzmatazz London The obvious beauty of this mouthful of a party is that you can approach it in a number of ways. You can see it as a chance to get yourself a spanking new outfit from some of east London's finest, drunkest and most ridiculous fashionistas, an opportunity to meet new and exciting people who like doing bonkers things of a Wednesday or merely use it as an excuse to take your clothes off in front of strangers and gawp at others doing the same thing. The premise is simple, every time the klaxon sounds, you free yourself of an item of clothing and swap it with some likely looking sort until at the end of the night you look like an accident in a dodgy suburban branch of Cancer Research. As with these sort of things, the music tends to be somewhat superfluous - there are people undressing and changing, for goodness sake! However, for those who care, the tunes will be of the 1970s vintage punk, 1960s pure pop and 1950s glamour swing variety. LC \u00b7 Favela Chic, EC2, Wed 28 Bad Taste Children's Party Leeds Every so often a club night emerges that, while possessing little in common with its peers, still manages to capture the attention of a loyal audience. Bad Taste is one such effort, a peerless fanzine and club revelling in debauchery and filthy fun. In their world, wrong is very right, sexual ambiguity and experimentation are compulsory and making an effort with your wardrobe is the least you can do. Taking inspiration from their fanzine, the Bad Taste parties are themed, and this month they're holding a children's party. It could be wrong on so many levels, but that's the general idea. Playing live are Sheffield band Hipshakes, supplemented by the super Bad Taste DJs, playing punk, pop, and rock'n'roll wrongness from Suicide and the Cramps to the Stooges, Gene Vincent, the Fall and the Monks. Dress to regress. Marc Rowlands \u00b7 Santiago's, Grand Arcade, Fri 30 Deconstructed Falmouth By their own admission, the Deconstructed DJs don't get many wedding gigs; with Falmouth's happy couples preferring the more trad delights of Robbie and Beyonc\u00e9. This is a shame because their wholly inappropriate sets of big band Hendrix covers, movie scores, surf rock, broken electronica, Erik Satie, Cuban rhythm and African hip-hop would surely make any post-nuptial knees-up remembered for years. The DJs are music journalist Kingsley Marshall and ex-film critic Karl Phillips, who combine an eager yet inept mixing technique with a passion for the strange. Over the last five years they've enticed names like Rob Da Bank, Chris Coco and Tom Middleton down the A30 with little more than the offer of meagre payment, real ale and a fresh fish supper. Friday's session is a residents-only affair which, in this instance, is no bad thing.
