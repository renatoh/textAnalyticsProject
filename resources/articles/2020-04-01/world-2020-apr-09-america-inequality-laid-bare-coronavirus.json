Then, out of the blue a decade ago, the mother of three was told she was working for a different company. Mary P would carry on cleaning the same offices, but over time, while executives whose desks she was polishing continued to enjoy the fruits of their company\u2019s fortunes, she saw her pay erode, healthcare coverage diminish, and what had seemed a secure job turn into an ad hoc position with few protections. Then coronavirus made its appearance. \u201cThey told me to go home. They would call me if they needed me. I won\u2019t get paid. The health insurance only lasts until the end of the month,\u201d said Mary P, who did not wish to be identified because she hopes to return to her job. Had coronavirus hit 15 years ago, she reckons she would have been in the same position as those whose offices she cleaned \u2013 at home, collecting salaries, reassured by good health coverage if they fall sick. But now she is cut adrift. \u201cI can apply for food stamps and unemployment, but it won\u2019t pay the rent. I\u2019m really afraid of what happens if I get sick. I will just have to stay home. I can\u2019t afford to pay for a doctor,\u201d she said. As millions of Americans apply for unemployment benefits, the coronavirus pandemic has brutally laid bare the extent of US\u2019s growing inequality, not only between the super rich and the rest of the country, but in the quality of jobs and the social protections that come with them. \u2018It\u2019s not just about jobs\u2019 Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said: \u201cIt has drawn into focus those disparities in a way that it\u2019s not just about jobs, it\u2019s not just about wages. It\u2019s about health and working conditions and access to health insurance. All of these things highlight that there\u2019s two different societies in this country. Because of rising inequality, more people are vulnerable.\u201d The US is not alone in face a huge surge in unemployment because of the pandemic. But American workers are particularly vulnerable because they have neither the welfare safety nets afforded by France or Germany, nor the public healthcare of the UK and Canada. The rise of outsourcing, contract work and gig economy jobs has seen ever increasing numbers of workers exposed to sudden economic shock, whether because of a financial crisis or a pandemic. Coronavirus has also thrown a spotlight on the president\u2019s claims of a strong economy when so many American workers lack the resources to cope with even a brief period without work. A Federal Reserve survey last year said four in 10 workers would struggle to find $400 in an emergency, with out-of-pocket medical expenses presenting a particular hardship. Pat \u201cDuke\u201d Dujakovich, the president of the Greater Kansas City AFL-CIO union confederation, said large numbers of his members were suddenly put out of work and now face an uncertain future with many of them losing their healthcare coverage in the middle of a national medical emergency. Dujakovich, who was a firefighter for 30 years, said he saw what was to come on a single day after a series of concerts and sporting events in Kansas City were called off because of coronavirus. \u201cEverything got cancelled on a Wednesday. Thursday, the stage hands tore down what they had already set up, and that is the last time any of them worked anywhere in the region. They were the first ones to go and they\u2019ve been out of work for quite a while.\u201d To Gould, the crisis has been deepened by companies shedding responsibility. \u201cPart of this is about employers not taking responsibility for people that should really be on their books, whether or not they\u2019re gig workers, contract workers, self-employed workers. Those people are actually employees and they should be treated like employees,\u201d she said. Scraping together $800 a month Many of those workers lost their health insurance at the time they might most need it, with bills for coronavirus treatment potentially running into the tens of thousands of dollars. Laid-off workers are eligible to continue their coverage under a government scheme called Cobra. But Dujakovich said many would not be able to afford it. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure out how someone who just lost their job manages to scrape together $800 or a $1,000 a month to maintain those Cobra benefits,\u201d he said. There is no way I have found for a person who is unemployed on their own to try to get healthcare in America. It just doesn\u2019t exist. And so the only way is through employment.\u201d But even those who still have jobs are vulnerable to inadequate protections. Gould said more than a quarter of private-sector workers in the US cannot claim paid time off for sickness.. That, she said, puts large numbers of people on low pay at increased risk of Covid-19, because many of them have little choice but to go on working, even if they show symptoms, increasing the likelihood of the virus spreading. \u201cThis virus exposes a vast inequality between the professional sector, white-collar workers, who are able to weather this at home with much less risk, have paid sick days if they need to take it, have health insurance,\u201d said Gould. \u201cAnd then there is another class of workers that has far fewer protections. Those that are more likely to be exposed because of their jobs, more likely to get sick, more likely have adverse consequences from getting sick because of rising inequality, because they don\u2019t have paid sick days or health insurance.\u201d Many of those same workers are also more likely to contract Covid-19 because they have jobs that bring them into contact with the public such as transport workers, shop assistants and carers, highlighted by the death of Jason Hargrove, a Detroit bus driver. Two weeks ago, Hargrove posted a Facebook video venting his anger at a passenger who coughed in his face several times. \u201cFor you to get on the bus, and stand on the bus, and cough several times without covering up your mouth, and you know that we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic, that lets me know that some folks don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. The 50 year-old father of six contracted coronavirus and died 11 days later. Gould said this goes some way to explain why African American communities have been so badly hit. Many black workers have jobs that make it difficult to isolate while minority communities also endure higher levels of medical conditions \u2013 diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure \u2013 that make people more vulnerable to coronavirus. African American communities also have a harder time obtaining good healthcare. \u201cEven if they\u2019re OK to go to work, and they\u2019re healthy and strong, they could still be bringing home that disease to elderly family members or to family members that are at higher risk with heart conditions, with their asthma or whatever it might be.\u201d In Milwaukee county, Wisconsin, black people accounted for 81% of deaths from coronavirus but just 26% of the population, according to ProPublica. Even in cities that have yet to be badly hit, such as Kansas City, the highest concentration of coronavirus cases is in the district with the largest proportion of African American residents. \u2018You have to think \u2026 what can kill me first?\u2019 Dujakovich said that while those at the top are better able to insulate themselves from coronavirus, he told a told a meeting of national AFL-CIO leaders that they will not be able to avoid its consequences. \u201cI said right now the bankers don\u2019t give a fuck about working people, but they\u2019re going to give a fuck about us very shortly. When we stop making car payments and house payments and rent and all of those things, because working people have to prioritise,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the first pay cheque is missed and the second pay cheque is questionable and the third pay cheque is really questionable, then you have to kind of think of things as to what can kill me first. I need to feed my family this week.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
