The decision prompted fury from Westminster politicians and London assembly members who said it appeared that a ruling had been \u201csuppressed\u201d in order to protect Johnson from potentially damaging headlines at a crucial stage of the election campaign. In a private meeting held before parliament was dissolved last week, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) officials agreed not to announce whether they were going to investigate \u201cpossible criminality\u201d over allegations about a conflict of interest in Johnson\u2019s dealings while mayor of London with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri until after the election. Sources close to the IOPC investigation said the watchdog was on the verge of announcing its decision on whether it was proceeding with a criminal investigation. The IOPC was tasked by the Greater London Authority with assessing whether criminal charges should be brought because of the then-mayor\u2019s responsibility for London\u2019s policing. It is alleged Arcuri received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Johnson, including receiving large sums of public money for her technology firms. The offence of misconduct in public office carries a maximum term of life imprisonment. Johnson has denied any impropriety. Jon Trickett, shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: \u201cThis is incredible. It\u2019s a suppression of information which the public is entitled to have. Given the fact we\u2019re in a general election there should be maximum transparency.\u201d He added. \u201cThis decision must be reversed immediately.\u201d Caroline Pidgeon, a Lib Dem member of the London assembly\u2019s oversight committee, said the delay raised the possibility of Downing Street contact with the IOPC before its decision. \u201cIt raises questions over how independent the IOPC really is and whether the prime minister\u2019s lawyers have been exerting undue pressure,\u201d she said. The news follows a chaotic week for Johnson, the government and the Conservative party. A cabinet minister, Alun Cairns, was forced to resign, and the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, was heavily criticised for suggesting victims of the Grenfell Tower fire had lacked \u201ccommon sense\u201d for not defying advice of the fire services and fleeing the building. Saturday\u2019s latest Opinium poll for the Observer suggests the Tories\u2019 rocky campaign start could already be doing damage to the party\u2019s election prospects. Its lead over Labour has been cut by four points from 16 to 12 over the past week. When the prime minister was referred to the IOPC on 27 September, government sources described the move as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. Instead of announcing its decision on the investigation last week, the IOPC decided to cite election \u201cpurdah\u201d \u2013 the pre-election period during which restrictions are imposed on policy announcements and use of public resources \u2013 as a reason for deferring the announcement until after the 12 December poll. Critics point out that if the IOPC\u2019s decision had been not to investigate there would be no problem announcing that before purdah began. Trickett said: \u201cThere can be no possible excuse for purdah in this case.\u201d Pidgeon added: \u201cAn independent agency shouldn\u2019t be hiding behind purdah rules that may not even apply to it. This is absolutely in the public interest.\u201d Tom Copley, a Labour member of the assembly oversight committee, which has launched its own inquiry into allegations related to Johnson\u2019s relationship with Arcuri, said: \u201cIf it is true that the IOPC is hiding behind purdah rules, then that would be outrageous. The IOPC must do their job without fear or favour regardless of whether we happen to be having an election.\u201d The IOPC says it places great emphasis on being \u201centirely independent of the government\u201d. Its website adds: \u201cAs a totally independent body, not part of the police or government, we investigate and make decisions on serious and sensitive cases.\u201d When asked, a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said she was \u201cunable to confirm\u201d if purdah rules applied to the IOPC. In the Cabinet Office\u2019s special guidance for the 2019 general election, released last Monday, there is no reference to the IOPC. Similarly, the updated Commons briefing paper on purdah, published last Tuesday, has no reference to the watchdog. Purdah applies to non-departmental public bodies and other arms\u2019 length bodies but the official list of 407 agencies and other public bodies does not name the IOPC. An IOPC spokesman admitted he was \u201cnot entirely sure\u201d whether purdah rules applied to the organisation but because of the case\u2019s significance it may receive Cabinet Office guidance to be \u201con the safe side\u201d although they did not believe that had occurred. \u201cThe assessment is still ongoing as far as I\u2019m aware, nothing is imminent that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said. Despite the postponement of the decision it is understood the investigation is ongoing, although it remains limited to a \u201cscoping exercise\u201d. An IOPC spokesperson said: \u201cThe IOPC strongly refutes claims published in the Observer. This matter has not been finalised. We have not delayed any announcements on the status of this referral. Our assessment of this matter is ongoing as we continue to collect information and seek legal advice.\u201d She said the IOPC had not been \u2018tasked\u2019 by the GLA but that the monitoring officer was required by law to make the referral. The IOPC\u2019s involvement meant that an earlier, separate, misconduct inquiry into Johnson\u2019s relationship with Arcuri had to be paused. On 16 October it asked for a postponement of the London assembly\u2019s inquiry while it was \u201cacquiring material \u2026 to determine whether it is necessary for this matter to be criminally investigated\u201d. It has also emerged that London assembly members were told that the IOPC investigation would be \u201cdone and dusted\u201d by the end of this month. Among the allegations being investigated by the IOPC are questions over a payment of \u00a3126,000 of public money to Arcuri\u2019s businesses and why she was on three overseas trade missions with Johnson, despite not qualifying as a delegate. \u2022 The headline was amended on 11 November 2019 to clarify that the inquiry referred to would be conducted by the police watchdog, the IOPC, not the police."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
