There is the version of Night on Bare Mountain the conductor made for Walt Disney's Fantasia, as well as the Entr'acte to the fourth act of Khovanshchina, the \"symphonic synthesis\" concocted from Boris Godunov and his vivid orchestration of Pictures at an Exhibition. All those pieces are also included on Oliver Knussen's Stokowski/Mussorgsky disc with the Cleveland Orchestra for Deutsche Grammophon, and this really is the kind of spectacular orchestral writing that repays the kind of top-notch playing that is the Cleveland's stock-in-trade. Good though they are, the Bournemouth Symphony hasn't got the same tonal resources; though the results they produce for Jos\u00e9 Serebrier are decent, they lack the spine-tingling presence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
