This year, the 46-year-old grandmother won\u2019t have the money for stamps to send them out. Instead Coleman, a home healthcare worker in Memphis, who works three different jobs at wages that hover around $8.50 an hour, will care for patients on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in hopes of earning enough money to stave off eviction. At a time when labor market and consumer spending statistics point to a booming holiday season economy, Coleman is one of millions of Americans who are one missed paycheck away from homelessness. Some must even choose between holiday gifts and rent. Coleman has already received a warning from her usually agreeable landlady that she needs to catch up on back rent by Christmas or face eviction. She makes $1,300 a month and pays $600 rent. She recently had to take out a payday loan because the power company had turned off her electricity. Now she isn\u2019t sure where she will come up with the extra $200 she needs to stay in her apartment. \u201cThe holidays are very depressing for me,\u201d said Coleman. \u201cI\u2019m not a material person. But I don\u2019t have the extra to spend. I\u2019ve been stretching to make ends meet. But I can\u2019t even get the ends to come close to each other.\u201d While the economic indicators are up for some, a deeper look at the realities facing those at the lower end of the economic spectrum shows many who, like Coleman, are barely able to hang on. For instance, a survey of nearly 7,000 Americans released by the Federal Reserve Board in May found just under half of respondents said they would not be able to handle a $400 emergency expense, without having to borrow. \u201cPeople are working; they are just not working at high enough wages or for enough hours,\u201d said Sarah Bohn, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, who studies the economics of poverty. \u201cWages are not increasing at the rate housing costs are rising. We see that as the number one factor driving poverty.\u201d Tonia McMillian, who has been running a home-based childcare center in Bellflower, California, for the last 25 years, recently had to scale her program down to six children from 12, because when she paid her assistants minimum wage she found she was no longer earning it herself. After business expenses and taxes, she said she only makes about $12,000 a year. \u201cEvery time you get an extra penny,\u201d she said, \u201csomething comes along that costs a nickel more.\u201d For the holidays, she wanted to get gifts for the children she cares for, so she is financing it through an online retailer that offers credit for purchases. She\u2019ll be paying it off for the whole year. Sarah Delte is just managing to survive being a single mom in the expensive San Jose, California, housing market. She said she scrapes by because she has a Section 8 housing subsidy, food stamps and her mother living with her, in addition to having a part-time job at Jack in the Box. But even working in a city, where the $12 minimum wage will go up to $13.50 on 1 January, Delte said she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford her $2,500 rent without a housing subsidy. \u201cI\u2019m blessed to have help,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who are working and who don\u2019t have anything to fall back on.\u201d Ann, a home healthcare worker raising a 10-year-old son in Vancouver, Washington, doesn\u2019t know how she would do it if she didn\u2019t have her fiance to share her $1,300 a month rent. The holidays just add a strain to her budget. \u201cThe whole thing\u2019s expensive,\u201d said Ann, who did not want to give her last name. \u201cThere\u2019s the Christmas tree. Then you\u2019re expected to host dinner and buy presents.\u201d This year she had to wrestle with whether to spend the money to take her son to the holiday light show at the nearby Oregon zoo. In the end, she decided it was worth scrimping on something else, so she could spend time with her son. Charities and homeless services groups around the US will often hold an adopt-a-family program so that donors can help families who are homeless or on the verge celebrate the holidays with gifts. \u201cThat tries to address the problem of what do families do for the holidays,\u201d said Lenine Umali, of the nonprofit Compass Family Services in San Francisco. \u201cAnd there are people who do want to help.\u201d For Tonia McMillian, the best holiday strategy is to throw her energy into sharing Christmas with the children she cares for and worry about the bills later. \u201cI put up the tree this week,\u201d she said. \u201cMe and the kids are going to decorate it. Then we will probably bake cookies.\u201d \u201cBeyond that, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out. I always do.\u201d Do you have an experience of homelessness to share with the Guardian?
