I feel like this is the natural place to let this lovely rain-soaked day come to rest. Inspection: the dream within the dream. Here\u2019s the Guardian interactive World Cup standings, on your way out. Thanks everyone for all your correspondence over the day. The rainy OBO is often perversely the nicest OBO, because we get to spend a bit of time together rather than manically update the scores. That said, let\u2019s hope we get some cricket next time. England v West Indies at the Rose Bowl tomorrow, and remembering what they did to each other in the Caribbean a couple of months ago, that match couldn\u2019t be any bigger. And I\u2019ve got to give points for competing to Brendan Large, who also gets points for having a name like a British sketch comedy character. Now this is a bold new foray into Erasmus Land. One of the lesser-known Faraway Tree destinations. Neeraj just casually knocking it out in five minutes. Star. Oooooh. Sharad has really upped the game with this alternate poster use. Oh yes. This is exactly what was called for. Aditya is first cab off the rank. To go back to Jack\u2019s question from earlier, this abandonment isn\u2019t really worth anything to the Kiwis at all. It gets them one point, which can be handy for teams that need a tie-breaker to qualify for a semi-final. But New Zealand already have a vastly better net run rate than anyone in the tournament, so if they do end up level on points then it\u2019s a win for the Land of the Long White Cloud. As for India, they miss out on a chance to go three from three, and slot in right behind En Zed at the head of the table. For now the Indians have five points, sitting third behind Australian and ahead of England. It\u2019s a handy point for them, but they would have backed themselves to beat New Zealand, and they would have enjoyed the workout against another strong team after knocking off the Aussies in London last weekend. As for the rest of us, we\u2019ve been deprived of a truly tasty match-up between New Zealand\u2019s excellent pace attack and India\u2019s powerful batting. Ferguson, Henry, Boult slinging the ball down at Rohit, Kohli, Dhoni... a damn shame. Not to mention Ross Taylor\u2019s red-hot form against Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvi Kumar. The pitch would have been zippy for fast bowlers, and the cloud cover might have introduced another element. But no good. We may not see these two teams play at all in this World Cup, unless they meet again in the finals. A crying shame. Enough rain now, everyone. Let\u2019s just agree this has come far enough. David Malcom emails in some classic journo war stories. \u201cI go way back to the days of uncovered wickets. All the old guys used to talk about how it produced exciting cricket. But it also meant hanging around for hours waiting for the pitch to dry out. I remember covering as a young reporter Northants v the New Zealand tourists in the early 1970s when it was a lovely sunny day from early morning and there was no play until 3pm because of fussy umpires. Gave me time for a good interview with Richard Hadlee but really pissed off spectators. \u201cThe grounds have improved greatly since then with modern drainage but the past week has again shown there is no way of guarding against terrible weather. A long tournament like this was always going to be at risk of descending into a soggy anticlimax. I have memories of freezing in press boxes at early season county matches and watching the downpours. The UK just does not have the weather for a game which is so sensitive to rain. Pity it never took on in Spain.\u201d Well, in Spanish-speaking countries at least, I can tell you that Cricket Mexico is doing some very good work. Here\u2019s one of the people making it happen, Craig White. The inevitable announcement comes through, and the match has been abandoned. New Zealand and India will share points. Jack Jorgensen is an Australian living in southwest England, and writes in with some sensible meteorology. \u201cThe average rainfall figures are misleading. You want to consider average days of rain &gt; 1mm. This is more useful as Australian rain in March is likely more intense, leading to less time actually raining. By my reckoning Sydney has 9.9 such days in March on average, and London 7.4. So whilst London has half as much average rainfall in volume, it\u2019s likely spread out across more days, and hence the chance of rain affecting the play is not all that different. PS: thoughts on how happy this washout might make the Kiwis?\u201d Quite so. But if the chance of rain is not all that different, it still derails the rather silly argument that we shouldn\u2019t play cricket in England, the place where it was invented, in June, the month where more of it has been played than any other. And a couple more ticket price emails, which have some very useful detail. Thanks everyone. Starting with Andrew Cosgrove. \u201cPrices for tickets were in line with perceived demand, so the most expensive matches were those involving England, India and Pakistan. On the other hand, I don\u2019t think Ind vs Pak was any more expensive than Eng vs Anyone. There were about four bands of prices, with the lower one being cheap - tickets for \u00a318 were available, mostly for games involving Afghanistan or Bangladesh. It doesn\u2019t seem that unreasonable. India vs Pakistan was the most oversubscribed sporting event in this country since the 2012 Olympics, making the tickets cheaper just would have made it carnage.\u201d I can understand that logic, but the unfortunate corollary is that it reduces demand by financial clout. So basically it\u2019s a sporting body saying it will alleviate the pressure by limiting access to wealthier people. Not exactly an unprecedented strategy in our society, but not one that survives ethical scrutiny for me. Ishfaq Razzak, meanwhile, writes that \u201cit\u2019s been really difficult to get tickets through the ballot but I get it, everyone wants tickets and it\u2019s a fair way of doing it. I managed to get tickets to the Pakistan v Sri Lanka match (rained off) at \u00a320 but the Pakistan v India match was close to a hundred! Pakistan v India is the hottest ticket around, I\u2019ve seen offers at \u00a3800 (that\u2019s cheap) to \u00a31700 for Gold tickets. \u201cIt looks like the punters that have bought extra tickets are selling for at least double, I bought Pakistan v NZ at \u00a340 ea whereas face value is \u00a320. It\u2019s been 20 years since the last World Cup here so I guess there\u2019s no other way to buy tickets from friends / touts if you don\u2019t get selected. I paid \u00a395 (face value) to a friend who managed to get Pakistan v Bangladesh at Lord\u2019s on 5th July. Warner stand, terrace, front row, Gold tickets. Seems like an okay price when compared to football ticket prices. Friend is selling the remaining two tickets at \u00a3150 each and he\u2019s getting lots of interest. See you at Lord\u2019s.\u201d Indeed. I don\u2019t want to know what tickets to the final will cost, especially if a couple of teams in light blue make the cut. And that umpire inspection has led to an announcement of another umpire inspection, at 3pm. Layers within layers. Wait, wasn\u2019t Inspection that movie with di Caprio and Joseph Gordon Levitt? Can someone photoshop the poster for me in the next few minutes? Some ticket correspondence. It\u2019s time for another exciting episode of Umpire Walk, the show where umpires wander about and poke the ground with umbrellas. It\u2019s all rather Lady Bracknell, prodding something with your brolly tip to see if it\u2019s working or express your displeasure. Now they\u2019re meeting with a delegation of ground staff to discuss the terms of their surrender. We\u2019ve shifted narratives, now Tyrion Lannister may be involved. In other cricketing news, England\u2019s women are taking on the West Indies down at Chelmsford. So there\u2019s no rain (at the moment) out Essex way. Tammy Beaumont and Amy Jones are off to a good start, they\u2019re 40 without loss in the 10th over. But it looks like it might rain there soon, too. Beaumont has made 61 and 32 so far in this series, and Jones 18 and 91. So they\u2019ll both be keen to stay out there as long as possible. \u201cWelcome Geoff,\u201d writes Sreekanth Nandakumar, who is very kind to do so. \u201cAm I the only Indian fan who hope the India-Pakistan match is abandoned due to rain ? The ICC has been charging exorbitant prices for all the India matches, especially the Pakistan one. If it is abandoned, they will be at least three quarters out of pocket which will give me absolute happiness. The UK government have even increased the visa price to the UK from Europe to around 230 Euros from 100 Euros two years back, which is insane. It is only around 20 euros to fly from Brussels/Cologne to London. Normal fans have been abandoned and I see that the rain gods are not happy with that.\u201d This is an interesting point. I didn\u2019t realise that the ticket prices had spiked for specific games at this tournament. If anyone else has experience of this, let me know about it. What have you paid for tickets, officially? How did it vary by match? What have you paid for tickets from scalpers / touts? Drop me an email or a tweet. For context on rainy venues, here are Ric Finlay\u2019s numbers referring to Australia\u2019s most recent World Cup. \u201cAfternoon Geoff,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cIn the absence of any actual cricket, I\u2019m getting my summer reading list in order, and so have just ordered a copy of \u2018Steve Smith\u2019s Men\u2019, written coincidentally by someone with the same name as your good self. Any idea if it\u2019s any good?\u201d Simon, all I can tell say is that the man in a charlatan of the highest order. I don\u2019t know him but I don\u2019t trust him. I certainly don\u2019t trust a word he wrote. Also I believe that e-book sales give him a better royalty than paper copies, but also that giving physical books as gifts is a fine way to express love or friendship. What has particularly interested me over the last week or so is how angry some people are at the fact that it\u2019s raining. Lots of comments about how this is all the ICC\u2019s fault or England\u2019s fault or someone\u2019s fault, and that the World Cup should never have been staged here, or should have been at a different time of year, or something. The interesting part is that every cricket country has rain, and washouts, and abandonments. I seem to recall sitting through a lot of rained out Tests over Boxing Day and the New Year\u2019s week in Melbourne and Sydney. A lot of two-session days in Sri Lanka. The 2016 World T20 in India, where they played that blockbuster against Pakistan at what felt like midnight after delaying and delaying a rain-affected start in Kolkata. That was after a decision a week or so earlier to move the match from Dharamsala, where I was stationed, and where I can attest that we saw more than our share of Himalayan rain, deluges, and a massive hailstorm that blocked the roads in and out of town for a night. So, yes. Rain. It happens. Sometimes more and sometimes less than others. Maybe English grounds could look at covering their whole outfields though, so we could have got some play during the reprieves on a day like this. The rain seems to have stopped, incidentally. But even if we had full ground covers today, I can\u2019t see that we could have got more than about 20 overs in so far. It\u2019s testament to the hardy types that cricket attracts that there are any people still at the ground. Surely this is going to be a washout. The umpires had two hour-long delays to try to give the ground time to dry while it wasn\u2019t raining. Now it\u2019s raining all over that ground again. And yet the stands are a good portion full of optimistic souls in outdoor wear, wandering about with hoods up, chatting and eating their snacks and listening to a playlist that has obviously been lifted from a mid-popularity fast fashion store. Bless your dreams, all of you. Hello all. Today, we are all Virat Kohli in a beanie, leaning out of a window looking sad and cold. Who would want Virat to be sad? Monsters. But one cannot reason with weather. We drove up from Taunton to Nottingham last night through hours of teeming motorway rain, a real Douglas Adams sequence of different types of downpour. And here we are, with Type 72 (misting persistent drizzle that makes you much wetter than it has any right to by volume) causing a mushrooming of umbrellas all through the stands. And that, my friends, is me done. Thank you for making the last five hours fly by with your emails. Sure, we haven\u2019t seen a ball bowled. And yes, we\u2019re all very frustrated. But I hope we\u2019ve learned a thing or two about drones along the way. What more could one want? For the next stint, I wish Geoff Lemon, to my right, good health and dry weather. Talk to you all again over the weekend. Bye! \u201cA genuine query,\u201d in from Avitaj Mitra. \u201cWith the washouts so far (and the potential for more in future), I\u2019d say it\u2019s not beyond the realms of impossibility to assume that two teams might end up with identical records. (Even the NRR might be same). Say this is the case for the 4th spot. Which team progresses in that case? (Before you say head to head result, what if the match between those two teams was also washed out?) A pretty little dilemma for the ICC, eh?\u201d If my decade in politics taught me one thing, whenever you go through a process like this, eventually, at some stage, you end up drawing lots. This might be that. Alternatively. \u201cWhy not get all the teams together and play a game of musical chairs?\u201d asks Uma Venkatraman. \u201cLast four standing are the semi-finalists. Between now and July 14, there will be enough reserve days for two matches and the final.\u201d John Little rounding us out for the time being with a bit of Old Fashioned Commonsense. \u201cCan\u2019t they just have reserve days starting now? It\u2019s not bloody village cricket and they have a wedding to go to tomorrow or work on monday. How hard can it be to arrange a cricket match when even the ICC can manage it?\u201d Harder than it sounds, according to the ICC\u2019s statement on Monday in relation to this topic. These are massive events. But if they had their time again... This is a pretty cool radar type thing. Thanks to John Morrissey, who emailed it through earlier. It reads: \u201cLight rain stopping in 20 min., starting again 25 min. later.\u201d Rinse and repeat. Some pot pouri, shall we. \u201cBy the time England and Wales\u2019s turn comes around again for the CWC,\u201d begins John Starnuck, \u201cmeteorologists might have got even better at long-term forecasts. Not that this would necessarily be taken into account; after all, who would schedule a tour of Sri Lanka during the monsoon season? Oh. Still, built-in reserve days, plus possible extensions to a day\u2019s play to 10pm would still be worth it.\u201d I\u2019m a little bit worried what this will do to England\u2019s reputation. Talking to several senior World Cup officials a few weeks before the tournament, I asked them all the same question: what keeps you up at 2am? They all said rain. \u201cTalking of great songs,\u201d wrote Abhijato Sensarma a while back. \u201cSurely one wouldn\u2019t mind if I nominate \u2018Stand By\u2019? I wasn\u2019t that impressed by it at first, since it wasn\u2019t exactly World Cup-esque, but those thoughts have been long abandoned... LORYN and Rudimental have composed an absolute BANGER for the ages!\u201d I\u2019m with you. They have nailed it with the song. On what happens if rain hits later in the comp, Andrew Gladwin has the skinny, and it is as we assumed. \u201cIf both days of the semi-finals are rained off, then higher place in the round-robin table goes through \u2013and if final rained-off, trophy shared,\u201d he says. \u201cBut surely the ICC should now be looking at creative ways to settle rained-out knock-out matched in the highly likely event that it happens \u2013how about a dance-off with the Strictly Come Dancing judges?\u201d I DECLARE A THUMB WAR! \u201cSurely this is the kind of game where both sides would probably take the rain off,\u201d suggests Kevin Wilson. \u201cHelps then both with qualification seeing as they\u2019re both likely to make the SFs.\u201d At this stage, I\u2019m sure that will be the chat in the dressing room. It is still raining, although not as heavily as it was 10 minutes ago when it was sheeting down. Semi-heavily. Actually, upgrade that to quite heavily. We aren\u2019t far away from Geoff Lemon taking the baton at Trent Bridge, would you believe. I\u2019ll get through as many emails as I can before that special ceremony takes place. \u201cThanks for your perseverance!\u201d Thanks for being part of it, William Stenhouse. \u201cI just saw that the women\u2019s one day is at The CloudFM County Ground, so that seems apt. Still, you can multitask and OBO both of them.\u201d Like playing two pianos, it can be done but I wouldn\u2019t advise it. Whenver I think of the CloudFM, I wonder whether one day we can get the HatFM County Ground. Check out The Spin podcast! Subscribe in all the usual places with the excellent Emma John and her rotating panel of pundits. I\u2019m on next week, from memory. I said that we were moving on from roof chat, and we are. But I can\u2019t resist this from Tom Carver. \u201cTor Turner is on the right track but not quite there. What they need is a stadium sized one of these. Apparently Harrow school in Beijing has one over its sports fields (to keep the air pollution out), so they must come in fairly large sizes.\u201d Hold on. You\u2019re telling me the answer might be... a BIODOME?! Pauly Shore, at last it is your time to shine again. The big covers are off again. Yep. You better believe it. A lot of angry emails about rain and England and so on. Evidently last year was the outlier and it is normally very wet in June here. I suppose they could have played this in August and the Ashes in June? Alternatively, they might ban England from hosting it in 20 years from now when it is next their turn. Given broadcasters are now likely to miss an Indian fixture, you couldn\u2019t rule that out. \u201cFollowing the Guarding OBO for quite some time now, have to say its really entertaining especially when the weather is like this.\u201d Thanks, Kshitij Sikawar in Delhi. We\u2019re giving it our best. \u201cWe want reserve days!\u201d There were reserve days in 1999, of course. Indeed, it allowed England vs India to continue on a second day, the hosts eliminated after collapsing. Had the game been washed out, they would have progressed to the Super Six. It was Zimbabwe\u2019s mighty win (Neil Johnson\u2019s masterpiece) over South Africa in Chelmsford, as rain fell in Birmingham, which set up that crazy final day in the groups. Check it out. A good time to return to drones and tarps, then. Ian Forth is with me but doesn\u2019t want to \u201center the Beefy phase of my life and grumble to anyone who\u2019ll listen.\u201d Lucky, then, that we have solutions. Tor Turner has just travelled from Manchester to London and \u201ccan confirm it was raining every place the train passed through,\u201d which is far from ideal. It\u2019s given him time to think, though. \u201cIn terms of roofs, inflatable ones would be the way to go. I know it sounds weird but stay with me.\u201d Oh, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m with you. \u201cThis company reckons it could be manufactured off site and installed in a single night. I\u2019d like to see them manage that for a stadium mind.\u201d Be right back, off to throw my wallet at them for all the shares they\u2019ll give me. Elbert Matt Loubser is also into my inbox on the topic, from South Africa. He\u2019s not keen. \u201cI am an engineer, but not of the structural persuasion. Greatest challenges with implementing a temporary roof are matters such as the mechanics required for relatively quick setup or breakdown (rain cover times 20), man-power wouldn\u2019t cut it and the machines required would have to be integrated with the structure of the stadium (including lighting). Cost and inconvenience would lead architects to rather install a permanent roof. But indoor cricket is another matter; how high would the roof have to be? Will grass-care be assured? What will the white-clad Test Match officials have to say about this sudden change? It\u2019s just not on.\u201d Drones, though. Drones with tarps. With gutters that manage the flow. Et voila! Last but not least for now, M. B. Anand with his first ever email to the OBO! Welcome to the club. Make sure it is not your last. \u201cVery interesting ideas - holding up a tarp with drones or balloons,\u201d he begins. \u201cSome quick calculations below to check feasibility: 1) Drones - Problem is power. Considering most stay aloft for about half hour and the very best, costing around $7500, can last no more than a couple of hours before needing re-juicing, this is likely to be a problem. Of course, we could arrange a complicated \u201cchange of guard\u201d as drones rotate in and out constantly.... 2) Hot air balloon - Representative heavy duty tarp weight = 18 oz. per square yard With a ground, say a circle of about 80m, the tarp weight is about 12183 kg. Given that a cubic foot of air lofts about 7 g of weight, this translates to a large spherical balloon of about 150 ft. in diameter. About a third of the size of the ground. Or many smaller ones that add up to the same volume. That seems quite feasible. Balloon wins, I think. Let\u2019s do this!\u201d This started with a shadecloth in space and has morphed into a hot air balloon. I\u2019m proud of the progression. But I think, for now, I\u2019m going to move this conversation on. Thanks for the many, many emails on it. It\u2019s been fun. Of course it is. Within five minutes of the inspection announcement, all the covers are on again. This is the heaviest it has been since 10:15am, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m not even going to say it this time. And guess what: it\u2019s dark again, too. I must say, your emails today are outstanding. There are a lot of them, so please don\u2019t be angry with me if they don\u2019t all get the attention they deserve. \u201cAny mathematicians out there?\u201d asks Ian Forth. \u201cIs a compressed game likely to have a disproportionate effect on a net run rate?\u201d \u201cSo you are telling me there is not one ICC authority member that figured out that a World Cup in England could have some serious rain affected matches? yells Hugo. \u201cReally poor planning on their behalf accoring to me.\u201d I can\u2019t sign up to that one. There was 2mm of rain here last June. It sucks but it happens. Check out the days rained out during Sydney Tests over the years. But the broader point about planning, well, back to my giant umbrella bit shortly. \u201cIt\u2019s now 5am in Edmonton in Western Canada and the games start at 3.30 am and we are anxiously huddled around the TV, but this totally sucks!!!\u201d adds Mike Weerasooriya. Thanks for sticking it out. I really hope this happens today. The crowd outside this morning were just brilliant. Three hours should do the trick. More grounds that rock your world that aren\u2019t talked about so often. Garry Sharp loves Adelaiade for the nocturnal reasons - don\u2019t we all. Great night out, especially since they liberalised their laneways. He\u2019s also fond of Sophia Gardens. \u201cJust the perfect sized stadium. And that Welsh warmth.\u201d Also the scene of Shane Watson\u2019s final Test Match, let\u2019s not forget. The place was heaving that day. Back in the middle, all the big covers are off and only the hovercraft is left. More importantly: the darkest clouds seem to have lifted. It\u2019s still overcast but no longer deathly. No formal word quite yet on when the inspection will be, however. \u201cHardly an original sentiment I imagine, but a washout here is no bad thing for we Kiwis (collective noun: \u2018we-ki-wis\u2019),\u201d writes Ben Bernards. \u201cA shared point against India clearly helps the Quest For The Final 4. Worst-case scenario is the sunshine coming out at 3pm, and being defeated in a resultant 20-over slap-a-thon.\u201d For those interested in these things, in order to get a T20 played before time runs out, they need to spark up the first ball by 4:20pm. At least this was the time we were given last Friday when there was the Bristol washout. I\u2019m hopeful again. On that same theme, from Andrew Cosgrove. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to too many grounds, but I\u2019d agree with you that the Basin is my favourite. And obvious. Aside from that, I love that Sophia Gardens is slap-bang in the middle of the city, and just a short walk along the River Taff from the railway station (and it\u2019s a lovely walk). Hagley Oval is less convenient, but a great place to watch cricket; it feels like you\u2019re watching a Test match on your local park.\u201d Yes and yes. Cardiff because they sing Bread of Heaven over and over, which really gets me fired up and wishing I tapped more into my Welsh family history. Hagley Oval for the reasons you state. Geoff and I were there in January 2016 when Brendon McCullum smashed his 54-ball ton, to break the record in his final Test Match. I was on radio commentary for 20 minutes when he moved from 40 to 82. He made the next 18 runs in the next five balls. Special city. Love Christchurch. A nice note from Eoin in Dublin on an earlier topic. \u201cAlways love the OBO, especially when it\u2019s raining...saves me from having to do some work. On the subject of favourite cricket grounds, there are so many beautiful ones around the world. Adelaide, Basin Reserve, Newlands, Eden Gardens etc. The Himachal Pradesh ground at Dharamasala is spectacular, but for all that, my favourite ground I\u2019ve ever been to is the old Rec in Antigua. Full of noise and colour as you sat there in the sun with a gentle breeze, drinking a beer, looking out over the Caribbean and watching the Windies play a test match. Such a shame it\u2019s gone. What a way to spend a few days.\u201d Great nomination. Both times I\u2019ve toured Antigua have led to me spending hours there in repeat visits. Last November, this brought a lovely moment. Out the back, they still have the food stalls and so on. I pulled up at one to grab some lunch at the front bench. A couple of bites in I look up and who is sitting next to me but Sir Curtly Ambrose. \u201cHe always drops in when home,\u201d the boss told me after he left. I feel like we\u2019re being gaslit by the covers. Which, sure enough, after coming off again. Just the big ones. Can\u2019t wait to tell you in about 20 minutes that there is going to be an inspection at 1:30pm. Mark my words. Back to my idea, [Ted Hastings] now we\u2019re cooking with gas [/Ted Hastings]. Ben Finn to open the batting, from the many emails I\u2019ll try and get through on the topic. \u201cHere is my suggestion: in the event of washout-threateningly dreadful weather forecasts such as today, there could be an army of drones, tethered to the stadium, attached to some kind enormous tarpaulin. Arranged in a circle with one in the middle that would fly highest to allow runoff, these drones take flight and hoist the tarp above the entire ground. This could play havoc withlateral movement of the ball, so once in place, the roof would have to remain for the duration of the match, much like on Centre Court. What could possibly go wrong (provided the ground is not near an airport)? Thank you for your entertaining World Cup coverage in all conditions!\u201d BEN! What a start! Cop that! Broadly in line with this, my Airbnb host this morning suggested that the military now has the ability to use thermal technology to shift where rain falls. Was she having me on? I feel like maybe she was having me on. \u201cAn engineer or ideas person, you say?\u201d adds Joby Allen. This is promosing. \u201cMyself (engineer) and my mate Barry (ideas) were discussing this very matter whilst sat in the rain at the Ageas Bowl on Monday. Our conclusion was a giant tarp held up by drones (engineer) or miniature hot air balloons (ideas).\u201d Drones! I never even thought of this but now it\u2019s all so obvious. So clear. I\u2019m writing you a proper reply. Let\u2019s invent something brilliantly bonkers. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Brian Withington, always a pleasure. \u201cI was intrigued to read about your motor home journey from Taunton to Nottingham last night. I have visions of you pluckily criss-crossing the country and \u2018freedom parking\u2019 in side roads by the grounds, eking out your frugal Guardian daily allowance with a bag of chips and reading a well worn Wisden by street light.\u201d It\u2019s actually the bus of two colleagues doing pretty much as you suggest, Gav Joshi and Bharat Sundaresan, two of the very best people in all the cricket world. \u201cOr is it more like the epic VW Camper Van questing journey to and around Pakistan from Duckworth-Lewis Method\u2019s \u2018Meeting Mr Miandad\u2019? Speaking of which, the great man turned 62 years old yesterday (not many people know that - and I was shocked that he\u2019s older than me). Where (whither?) are you next hitching your wagon?\u201d We\u2019re finished for now; \u2018twas a one-night-only affair. But this is their #wconwheels from today, featuring Geoff and me at 1:30am looking as bad as we sounded after a day that included radio commentary, writing, video, podding and meal deals. \u201cJust reading your blog and notice you are recommending the Trent Bridge Inn to hunker down in while rain ruins play,\u201d Chris Slade begins, with a reference to coffee in the subject line, which I\u2019m looking forward to. \u201cIf it\u2019s a little too early for some of your readers to be on the sauce then I can highly recommend the excellent coffee served by Okende in West Bridgford. It\u2019s a great little speciality coffee shop that has recently opened up and is run by two young entrepreneurs.\u201d Consider it recommended. I\u2019m going to send Ben Jones out to grab me a flattie. Stuart Eaton has a suggestion as well. \u201cIn situations like this with the rain coming and going, why can the teams not just get the toss done indoors somewhere? Will save time and also warranting a pitch inspection for a coin throw.\u201d There is probably a logical reason for this to do with the ability for the captain to change their XI until the final moment in relation to the surface, but yes, this does seem a sensible way to save some valuable time on a day like today. I\u2019m just picturing Virat Kohli holding the trophy up with, oh, I dunno, Mashrafe Mortaza. One arm each, on the balcony at Lord\u2019s. And the world will live as one. Out come the big covers. You couldn\u2019t make this up because WHY WOULD YOU? YOU WOULDN\u2019T. There are only about six umbrellas up. Maybe ten. It can\u2019t be more than a spinkle. But, once again, it\u2019s enough to halt the process. \u201cI am Jeremy Flint enjoying your coverage in sunny and warm Manila.\u201d Hello Jeremy. Don\u2019t rub it in, man. \u201cPerhaps you could share on the feed what would happen if both the scheduled day and the reserve day are washed out during the knockout stage. It does not seem an unlikely outcome does it?\u201d Taking a quick sample of those sitting near me, we agree that it must be points in the group stage. I\u2019ll check this out when I see somebody wearing an ICC uniform. \u201cDo you know what happens if the Reserve Day of the Final is washed out?\u201d CricViz\u2019s Ben Jones asks from the seat next to me. \u201cThey share the trophy.\u201d What a circus that would be. I almost want it to happen for the yaaaarn. James Coyne from The Cricketer has a better idea: \u201cA bowl off in the indoor school!\u201d You know the drill by now. Just as it was at 10:30am and 11:30am: if there is no more rain, there will be an inspection at 12:30pm. Cue the rain then, right? \u201cThanks for the OBO and to you and Geoff for the daily pod,\u201d begins Tanya Wintringham. \u201cYou guys must be wired/knackered.\u201d Something like that. We hitched a ride in a motor home last night. And thank you; we\u2019re having a great time. Geoff will be along later for the second innings, provided we get that far. \u201cWith any luck Lockie will take 5 for 32, with back up from Trent who hasn\u2019t had a lot of luck/success in the last couple. Hopefully we will have learned to coordinate our outfield catching since the last game. We can then go on to find some proper batting form outside the Taylor/Williamson run out collective.\u201d I\u2019m very keen to interview Lockie Ferguson before the end of the tournament. I need to know the backstory behind the fan (family member? girlfriend?) who was dancing around in his official CWC19 jumper when making the winning runs against Bangladesh. I have an unhealthy obsession with cricket jumpers, which helps explain my delight in this photo wearing Zimbabwe\u2019s from 1992. I\u2019m not sure if I should even tell you this and raise hopes... but in the interests of transparency, the big covers are off once more. Don\u2019t take this as a sign of anything while it is so dark and unleasant. Let\u2019s do the pitch inspection dance again. \u201cWork,\u201d emails Ryan Bennett-Barlow. \u201cAbsolute belter of a song.\u201d Too right. I saw Charlotte play last year and she\u2019s the everything. \u201cA rather optimistic New Zealander hoping it clears up to continue the run of silky cricket our boys have been playing; if it doesn\u2019t at least I now have an absolutely wonderful tune from Charlotte Day Wilson in my head for the rest of the day.\u201d Now I\u2019m smiling. Calling all gamers. Cricket 19 is here. I had a brief look at it during the England kit launch before this World Cup. In that mock-up, Glenn Maxwell was batting at Lord\u2019s in a Test. I conclude that this is clearly a game conceived in my dreams. I\u2019m after an engineer. During the week, I\u2019ve been arguing on our daily WC pod that there must be a way to erect some sort of temporary tarp over a cricket ground. I\u2019m not saying that this is an easy fix but is it not worth having a conversation about? This is what Chris Meister is referring to below. Maybe what I\u2019m after is an Ideas Person rather than an engineer. Both, ideally. If you\u2019re it, email me. It\u2019s not a pretty view at Trent Bridge today. Brollies remain up, every cover in place. Nothing torrential but just enough to frustrate any hope of, well, anything. Although, as Rohit Singh notes, \u201cit is possible if you really try\u201d to play in the wet. \u201cGood to meet you today morning Adam!\u201d writes member of the OBO fam, Gaurav Jindal. It just happened to be that we met at breakfast at the AirBnb we were both staying at, Gaurav having made the trip from Mumbai to watch the Men in Blue. He also sent me the photo he took of us together, which serves as a fairly abrupt reminder that I\u2019m not 25 anymore. Not at 7am after four hours of kip, anyway. \u201cWhy did the infernally infuriating Steve Waugh refer to Hardik Pandya as the next Lance Klusener?\u201d ponders Amod Paranjape. \u201cI hold you responsible for this.\u201d Speaking of Lance, we have him on the 1999 World Cup pod next week and it\u2019s fair to say he still plays all his shots. The next ep is with Andy Flower on Zimbabwe and might be the best interview we\u2019ve ever done across two series. Great man. Remember what I said an hour ago about there being an inspection if no further rain at 10:30am? We just had the very same message from the ICC for 11:30am. The problem, from my vantage point, is that it\u2019s now very gloomy overhead. Oh, and as I was about to hit send the big covers are coming on again with umbrellas up and all the rest. Yep, the rain is back. Not heavy, but enough. \u201cConsole yourself with the fact that there\u2019s a rare AFL Thursday morning game on,\u201d writes my best Eurovision friend (he has other traits too), Matthew Woolston. \u201cAFL straight into a India vs NZ T20 smash-up. The dream.\u201d Speaking of 2017, it\u2019s a replay of that year\u2019s Grand Final: Adelaide vs Richmond. The cricket link is that they\u2019re playing at Adelaide Oval, which was repurposed as an AFL ground about five years ago. My favourite of all the cricket grounds. Bit boring and reflexive of me to say that though, isn\u2019t it? Same with where I am today, Trent Bridge. Or Basin Reserve in Wellington. All magnificent but always the answer when citing the best places to watch the international game. Where else? What ground have you been to which rocked your world? And why? For me, it\u2019s Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka. I had the good fortune to cover the Test there when Bangladesh knocked off Australia two years ago. Every Australian in attendance was moved by the response from the remarkable crowd, including emotional Bangladesh PM on the field at the end. I\u2019m not going to get carried away... but the the covers on the square are being removed. That was a nasty little storm half an hour ago, so we\u2019ve got some waiting to do yet. Then again, I just received a text from former Blackcap Simon Doull, who is on TV comms today and would have good intel. He\u2019s not optimistic. But we\u2019ll plough on in any case. Need some cheering up? We had Matthew Engel with us at Taunton yesterday and it was lovely to see him. He punched out 800 of the best at stumps about Somerset then and now, which I strongly recommend. The county championship rolls on. Tanya Aldred\u2019s blog is a must. \u201cOnly one thing to do now,\u201d suggests Gurminder Chera. \u201cFind a pub and set up camp.\u201d I had a similarly-themed email from John Starbuck, recommending the Trent Bridge Inn. It\u2019s a pub I know well. Not on this tour, though. I worked out yesterday that I\u2019ve had five pints since opening day. Five. I\u2019m no boozehound (promise), but I can\u2019t remember the last 15-day stretch where I\u2019ve been so anti-social. I feel this is enough of a link to pop in my favourite song of 2017. The heavy rain has stopped. But it continues to spit. All the covers remain firmly on, though, which suggests the ground staff are expecting more to hit soon. Sigh. \u201cDo you really think that\u2019s Kane Williamson in the commercial?\u201d I\u2019m just the copy/paste guy with that. But yes, I\u2019m sure David wouldn\u2019t mind me correcting the record that the Blackcap in the advert is, indeed, Grant Elliott - not Kane. They should name one of the second-tier domestic T20 comps after GE one day. I\u2019m sorry to report. Truly sorry. \u201cOver here in NZ with the Kiwis,\u201d begins David Perkins. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty level headed about the whole thing. But worst aspect (worse even than naming approach for all their sports teams) is one of the banks trying to drum up local fan support as the pyjarmy army. The advert featuring Kane W is as bad as you would imagine.\u201d Let\u2019s dig it out, shall we? Good grief. Make it stop. Then again, I want those New Zealand PJs real bad. \u201cThis World Cup is spoiled by rain gods and you have been splendid in its apt coverage,\u201d gushes Mahendra Killedar. I\u2019ll gush back on behalf of all of us: why, thank you. The OBO is a joy when operating every day through a major tournament, rain or otherwise. \u201cWhilst we are at it, how about renaming this blog to DBD? Drop By Drop!\u201d If this keeps up, we might have to. But I\u2019m maintaining the positive energy about today\u2019s prospects. We might here here until 9pm, but I reckon we\u2019re getting on. Official update from the ICC in the press box: \u201cif there is no further rain, the umpires will inspect the pitch at 10:30am.\u201d As we received that news there was a roar around Trent Bridge from the Indian faithful as the hovercraft was removed. It reveals a nice, fresh pitch. Delicious. \u201cAre you allowed to comment on the ICC\u2019s disgraceful slapping down of Michael Holding?\u201d asks Gary Naylor on the tweet. (In fact, that\u2019s one of those questions that requires no answer - its mere stating is enough to tell us all we need to know). A terrible time for that story to drop after two days had been rained out, becoming the talk of the tournament. I mostly loved Mikey\u2019s line about whether he should simply go home rather than heading to the next game. It reminded me of an answer Ian Chappell gave Geoff and me when interviewing him recently, in relation to the time he was told what he could/couldn\u2019t say on air by the BCCI. Okay, I\u2019m upstairs in my seat. That\u2019s a start. It\u2019s also a start that the main covers have been removed across the square. The hovercraft is still siting over the main strip, but we\u2019re heading in the right direction. The toss is scheduled for 10am local time, which seems destined to be delayed. We\u2019ll see shortly. Will there be cricket? When I arrived here last night in the motor home that took me from Taunton to Nottingham, we didn\u2019t think so. It was torrential. It was biblical. It was not fit for the sport we love. However, despite mizzle and drizzle and all the rest over the last couple of hours, it hasn\u2019t poured. There\u2019s a gentle breeze running across Trent Bridge. We\u2019re a chance. Probably not at the scheduled starting time of 10:30am, but provided this break of sorts in the weather continues, I think we\u2019re a big hope of getting on. At a modern ground like Trent Bridge, perhaps sooner than might be the case if we were at a non-Test venue. With expectations so cruelly built up like that, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll bucket down as soon as I hit send. But if we don\u2019t, both teams have a big opportunity to take advantage of the washouts from earlier in the week by claiming two points and remaining undefeated. Whoever does might already have a couple of toes into the final four. In Blackcaps land, they\u2019re fit and firing. Tim Southee - the Lennon to Trent Boult\u2019s McCartney in the swing stakes - is fit and available. They\u2019d be made not to pick both of them on a morning like this. Alongside Lockie Ferguson - the quickest bowler in the World Cup so far - and Matt Henry, that\u2019s quite the quartet. India boast similar selection riches. Well, with the ball at least. They are, however, missing Shikhar Dhawan with a thumb injury for a couple of games, which he acquired when stroking a gorgeous ton against Australia on Sunday. The margin of victory there (36 runs) should have been a lot greater. They thrashed them, really. Whichever way it all plays out, rest assured that the OBO will be here to keep you company. If they do get on, let\u2019s hope for a game half as captivating as yesterday. Given I\u2019m currently writing this sitting on the ground in the Trent Bridge car park (long story; accreditation, urgh!) I\u2019ll just be a few minutes getting my act together and popping upstairs. But don\u2019t delay: drop me a line. Tweet me. Good morning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
