The plan for a panel of 10 people to choose the prototype will be announced on Tuesday by Yvette Cooper, the Housing Minister. The panel will choose from designs shortlisted in a competition run by the Department for Communities and Local Government, with the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment. The design will be sent to the 10 councils to be locally adapted, for example by using local building materials. The government has said that five of the new towns, of up to 20,000 homes, will be ready to live in by 2016."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
