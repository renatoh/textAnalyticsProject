It\u2019s been a good day\u2019s work Novak Djokovic, Alexander Zverev, Petra Kvitova, Caroline Wozniacki and Angelique Kerber, but it\u2019s been another grand slam to forget for Johanna Konta after her first-round defeat to Caroline Garcia. The British No1\u2019s year goes from bad to worse. But at least Andy Murray\u2019s back in action tomorrow, when he will face Fernando Verdasco. We\u2019ll be back with more live coverage then. Bye! Adrian Mannarino double-faults and Frances Tiafoe breaks to lead 6-1, 1-0. This is appalling from Mannarino. Frances Tiafoe crushes a forehand down the line to take the first set 6-1 against Adrian Mannarino. The American is looking very nifty indeed. Ivan Lendl will be pleased with this show of ruthlessness. Maybe it won\u2019t be close. Frances Tiafoe breaks again to lead Adrian Mannarino 4-0. On Grandstand, there\u2019s plenty of excitement about Frances Tiafoe. The young American took Roger Federer to five sets in the first round last year and he\u2019s a break up early on against Adrian Mannarino, the 29th seed. This one should be close. Elsewhere Lucas Pouille leads Yannick Maden by two sets, while David Goffin\u2019s a set up against Federico Gaio. Alexander Zverev is making quite the statement on Louis Armstrong. He leads Peter Polansky 6-2, 6-1, 1-0. Novak Djokovic, explaining that he was trying to give a few silent signals to his phsyio in the locker room, goes on to reveal that he and Marton Fucsovics both sat naked in ice baths during the 10-minute after set three. \u201cWhat a beautiful moment,\u201d he says. His wife, Jelena, has a confused smile on her face in the stands. Novak Djokovic speaks! \u201cWe obviously both struggled. I think it was the start of the third we started playing better. Before that it was survival mode. Credit to Marton for fighting well. He is a great guy and a great fighter. He deserves a round of applause. I am praying that in the next moment I get to feel better because I wasn\u2019t feeling great for most of the first three sets. But a lot of players struggled today and you just have to deal with it. It was a three-hour watch. I just want to thank everyone for staying until the end. I want to thank the US Open for allowing us to have a ten minute break after the third stet. We both needed it. The rule is we are not allowed to speak to any of our team in the locker room.\u201d The admirable Fucsovics saves a break point with a lovely forehand. But he knocks a forehand long on the second and Djokovic is through to the second round after a minor scare. Fucsovics will wonder about what might have been given that he was a break up in the third set, but it was one-way traffic once Djokovic had found a way to cope with the sweltering conditions. Djokovic will play the USA\u2019s Tennys Sandgren next. Monica Puig has walloped Stefanie Vogele 6-0, 6-0. Ouch. The Puerto Rican plays Caroline Garcia next. The crisis seems to have been averted by Novak Djokovic. He\u2019s a break up in the fourth set against Marton Fucsovics and appears to be over his stomach problem. The first set goes to Alexander Zverev on Louis Armstrong. But the fourth seed was generous enough to allow Peter Polansky two games. Since reaching the semi-finals at Wimbledon last year, Johanna Konta\u2019s grand slam results are two first-round exits at the US Open, second-round exits at the Australian and SW19 and a first-round exit at the French Open. The world No46 hasn\u2019t had a top-10 win in 2018. Are we watching Konta regress to her true level this year? This is another limp defeat at a grand slam, sealed when she sends a forehand long on Garcia\u2019s second match point, and she can have no complaints after being outclassed by a superior opponent. I wonder if she\u2019ll blame the media for this one. Oh for Fucsovics\u2019s sake! The Hungarian, who was a break up in the third set, finds himself facing a set point. He should cancel it out, only to mess up forehand volley at the net and then a smash, allowing Djokovic to hustle him into a wild forehand! Djokovic roars as he takes a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 lead on Arthur Ashe; then he disappears for a comfort break. Caroline Garcia moves a game away from the second round. Her slice has worked magnificently so far and it\u2019s left Jo Konta staring defeat in the face. Meanwhile Aryna Sabalenka, who packs one hell of a punch, has beaten the USA\u2019s Danielle Collins 6-0, 4-6, 6-4. Dominika Cibulkova, the 29th seed, has enjoyed an escape against Arantxa Rus. The punchy Slovakian has fought back to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. This is more like it from Djokovic, who fights to 15-40 before breaking back with a glorious backhand pass from left to right. They\u2019re back on level terms in the third set. Garcia whacks a backhand volley past Konta to hold. She leads 6-2, 4-1. It\u2019s looking grim for Johanna Konta. Caroline Garcia leads 6-2, 3-1. Maybe Konta can bribe the sixth seed with a slice of cake? The errors are mounting from Djokovic, who knocks a forehand long to hand another game to Fucsovics. It\u2019s 4-2 to the Hungarian in set three. With Ivan Lendl watching on, Alexander Zverev makes a quick start against Peter Polansky, breaking straight away on Louis Armstrong. It would be good to see Zverev put a proper run together here. He\u2019s been a bit flighty in grand slams so far. Fucsovics wears Djokovic down with a huge forehand and earns a break point with a killer blow. He clenches his fist. But he nets a forehand, letting Djokovic scramble to deuce. Then Djokovic grinds to take the next point, prompting him to whip the crowd into a frenzy. In the stands, Jelena urges her husband to lift his level. Eventually Djokovic holds. But Fucsovics still has the break in the third set. That\u2019s a disappointing result for Belinda Bencic. The Swiss has fallen to Aliaksandra Sasnovich of Belarus, losing 2-6, 6-1, 6-2. Another heat victim? Marton Fucsovics slams an ace down the middle to consolidate the break. Djokovic is going to explode in a minute. But the real drama\u2019s taking place on Arthur Ashe, where Novak Djokovic slaps a forehand into the net to drop his serve to love! Marton Fucsovics leads 3-6, 6-3, 2-1 against the tournament favourite and I apologise for writing the Hungarian off earlier. With Jo Konta serving at 2-5, Caroline Garcia races into a 0-40 lead. She can\u2019t take the first two set points, but a big backhand return on the third forces an errant forehand from Konta, who\u2019s got a mountain to climb now. It\u2019s looking like another early grand slam exit for the British No1. A wheezing Novak Djokovic swings an ace down the middle to scrub out a break point at the start of the third set. He\u2019s not looking himself, though. The Wimbledon champion is into the second round and will play Johanna Larsson next. It\u2019s bad news from Grandstand for fans of British tennis. Jo Konta finds herself down an early break against Caroline Garcia. She\u2019s got her work cut out. We noted earlier that Djokovic tends to win matches after taking the first set - but just look at the state of this one now. Djokovic has wilted in the heat and Fucsovics has taken full advantage, roaring back to win the second set 6-3 and level the match on Arthur Ashe. The Wimbledon champion\u2019s stomach is bothering him and he needs to regroup quickly, else we might not see that quarter-final against Federer. Djokovic is given a tablet by the doctor for his stomach issues and has his shirt off and is getting cold towels to every available part of his body. He makes his way to serve to stay in the set - he\u2019s taken his hat off presumably to cool down - the sun isn\u2019t so much of an issue with the court in shade. It worked anyway, he held to love. Konta is 2-1 in the first and the match is on serve. Tennys Sandgren, who will play the winner of the Djokovic-Fucsovics match, has won in straight sets. Fucsovics has just held with a lovely winner down the line and is 5-2 up in the second. Djokovic will now get some attention for his illness. Jo Konta is on court for her match against Caroline Garcia. Garcia has won the first game. Djokovic is having what some would delicately call stomach issues and has asked to see the doctor at the end of this game. A break point for Fucsovics! A lazy shot from Djokovic wafts wide to make it 30-40 but the Wimbledon champ sends a big serve down the T to make it 40-40. But Fucsovics gets another chance when Novak double faults. He sends a forehand long and we have a break! Djokovic lost that game rather than his opponent beating him after three unforced errors. Twenty fans have been taken for first-aid treatment in today\u2019s heat, according to ESPN. How does Caroline Wozniacki handle the weather? \u201cI just imagine I\u2019m laying on a beach with a margarita in hand,\u201d she says. Kerber and Gasparyan are 2-2 in the second set after the German won the first. Djokovic\u2019s eyes were rolling alarmingly when he was in his chair between games but he seems a bit perkier after some ice and cool towels. He\u2019s 0-30 up on Fucsovics\u2019s serve but the Hungarian fights back - he\u2019s played well today - to make it 3-2 in the second. Diego Schwartzman, surely one of the 90 best Jewish-Argentinian men\u2019s tennis players of the last five years, is 5-2 up against his compatriot Federico Delbonis. The heat continues to beat down and early retirements are up. It\u2019s not just the heat (96F/35C), it\u2019s the humidity. Djokovic is struggling in these temperatures and is getting the wet towel treatment on the side of the court. The court is in shade but that doesn\u2019t help with the humidity. He\u2019s 1-2 down in the second but it\u2019s on serve. Serial Twitter deleter Tennys Sandgren is flying along against Viktor Troicki: he\u2019s 6-3, 6-4 up. A dicey time for the 2016 champion, Angelique Kerber: her match against world No370 Margarita Gasparyan goes to a tiebreak in the first. It should be noted that the Russian is down in the 300s because of injury problems. Kerber had served for the set but her opponent has fought back admirably. But Kerber\u2019s experience is too much in the tiebreak and she has won the first set 7-6. Elsewhere in the women\u2019s draw, last year\u2019s semifinalist Coco Vandeweghe has fallen to Kirsten Flipkens 6-3, 7-6. Vandeweghe has had injury troubles of her own this year so it\u2019s not a complete shock that the No24 has gone down. Fucsovics is serving to stay in the first set at 5-2 against Djokovic and doesn\u2019t do well to start - he starts with a double fault. He holds though and Novak will serve for the set. It\u2019s a brutal day in New York, it took me about 34 seconds out of the air-conditioning to sweat when I strolled out for lunch. I imagine playing world class talent is even worse. Djokovic falls behind 0-30 on his serve but comes back to seal the first set 6-3. Novak is 221-8 after winning the first set in grand slams, so there may be a clue to how this one is going. Marin Cilic is through to the second round, Marius Copil retiring injured while trailing 7-5, 6-0, 1-1. This could have gone so differently if Copil had converted his set points in the first set, but Cilic was unstoppable after stirring at 1-5 down. It\u2019s a comfortable win for Cilic in the end, although he might be a bit concerned about his erratic start to this match. With this one done, next up on Grandstand are Johanna Konta and Caroline Garcia. Kiki Bertens, scourge of top-10 players, has seen off Krystina Pliskova. The 13th seed wins 6-0, 7-5. At least set two was more of a battle. Marin Cilic leads 7-5, 6-1 against Marius Copil. He trailed 1-5 in the first set! Copil has left the court for another medical timeout. Novak Djokovic breaks straight away as Marton Fucsovics nets a forehand. Everyone else can go and enjoy the New York sights. Marius Copil, who now trails Marin Cilic 7-5, 5-0, has called for the trainer. This has deteriorated for the Romanian. On Louis Armstrong, Angelique Kerber is underway against Margarita Gasparyan. Kerber, the former champion, went out in the first round last year and this could be a tough test against the Russian youngster. Ricardas Berankis has been forced to retire on Court 10. The Lithuanian trailed Hyeon Chung 4-6, 7-6, 6-0, 2-0. I suspect the heat\u2019s played its part. Next on Arthur Ashe, it\u2019s Novak Djokovic against Hungary\u2019s Marton Fucsovics. This is two-time champion\u2019s first ever match against Fucsovics. Marin Cilic has fought back from 1-5 to snatch the second set 7-5 off Marius Copil. He will win this 7-5, 6-0, 6-0. There\u2019s no coming back from that for Copil. A double-fault on match point is no way to go. Sadly, though, that\u2019s Sam Stosur\u2019s fate. A champion makes her exit, a former finalist marches on. Perhaps this is why Marius Copil\u2019s ranked 82nd in the world. The Romanian led 5-2 in the first set on Grandstand, but he\u2019s wasted set points and let Marin Cilic pull it back to 5-5. This has a feeling of inevitability about it now. Kiki Bertens is having a terrific summer and it looks like it\u2019s going to continue for the 13th seed. She\u2019s taken the first set 6-0 off Krystina Pliskova. Elsewhere Coco Vandeweghe\u2019s a set down to Kirsten Flipkens. The American could do with some home support. Jan-Lennard Struff has sent the USA\u2019s Tim Smyczek on his way, winning in straight sets, and Johanna Larsson\u2019s also through to the second round. The Swede\u2019s beaten Alize Cornet 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. I think Cornet led by a set and a break. Marin Cilic has saved five set points in the first set on Grandstand. He holds and Marius Copil will try to serve for it again at 5-4. Jelena Ostapenko has finally overpowered Andrea Petkovic, though she made hard work of it. The Latvian wasted two match points at 5-3 in the third set and almost ended up being broken at 5-5. But she\u2019s dug deep to convert her fourth match point and beat the German 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 in gritty, typically unpredictable fashion. Marin Cilic has one break back on Grandstand. Marius Copil served for the first set, but now his lead\u2019s been cut to 5-3. Has Cilic woken up just in time? Jelena Ostapenko whirs her racket over her head after saving two break points and holding for a 6-5 lead in the third set on Louis Armstrong. Andrea Petkovic will serve to keep this engrossing match alive. This is threatening to turn into a spectacular meltdown from Jelena Ostapenko, who\u2019s under pressure from Andrea Petkovic at 5-5 in the third set. Meanwhile Taylor Townsend has beaten fellow American Amanda Anisimova 3-6, 6-4, 6-3. Anisimova is only 16. One to watch. Marin Cilic, the 2014 champion, is having a nightmare on Grandstand. The seventh seed, who suffered an early exit at Wimbledon, has been broken twice in the first set by Marius Copil, an unseeded Romanian. Andrea Petkovic breaks back! Oh Jelena! Petkovic will serve at 4-5 in the third set. Jelena Ostapenko butchers forehand on two consecutive match points. Less than ideal. Andrea Petkovic is still standing. Just about. Jelena Ostapenko moves a game away from the second round, holding to lead 6-4, 4-6, 5-2. Elsewhere Hyeon Chung, the 23rd seed, has levelled his match against Ricardas Berankis. Caroline Wozniacki takes the first set 6-3, sealing it when Sam Stosur nets a forehand. Meanwhile Richard Gasquet has beaten Yuichi Sugita 6-3, 6-1, 6-3. Gasquet\u2019s a former semi-finalist here, though it\u2019s difficult to expect too much from the Frenchman this time. Andrea Petkovic breaks straight back. But of course. Oh Jelena! This is the start to the third set that Jelena Ostapenko would have wanted. Andrea Petkovic double-faults on set point and Ostapenko leads 6-4, 4-6, 2-0. On Arthur Ashe, Caroline Wozniacki and Sam Stosur have split a couple of breaks early on. This could be a grind. Naomi Osaka, the 20th seed, is in the mood to make an impact here. The Japanese blaster has thumped Germany\u2019s Laura Siegmund 6-3, 6-2 to move into round two. On Louis Armstrong, Andrea Petkovic nails an ace out wide to take the second set off Jelena Ostapenko, who challenges to no avail. They\u2019re going the distance! Wickmayer spurns a break point, sending a backhand return wide for deuce. It\u2019s not long before Kvitova has a break point and that\u2019s the cue for Wickmayer to net a forehand. The former Wimbledon champion is through to round two after a pretty comprehensive win. Petra Kvitova chops a stunning backhand slice away for 0-30. Then Yanina Wickmayer hands over three break points with a double-fault. Kvitova converts the second to break for a 6-1, 5-4 lead; she will serve for the match in a minute. They\u2019re underway on Arthur Ashe. The opening match sees former champion Sam Stosur take on former finalist and No2 seed Caroline Wozniacki. Petra Kvitova is determined to get this done in two. She gives a Yanina Wickmayer second serve the treatment, walloping a backhand return away to break back, and hauls herself back on level terms in the second set. In an all-American battle, Amanda Anisimova leads Taylor Townsend 6-3, 2-2. Another American\u2019s struggling, though - Noah Rubin\u2019s two sets down to Mikhail Kukushkin. You wonder if the heat\u2019s having an effect on Petra Kvitova. She\u2019s under pressure again on serve and this time she cracks, wafting a forehand wide. Yanina Wickmayer breaks for the first time to lead 3-1 in the second set. Hyeon Chung led by an early break against Ricardas Berankis, but the South Korean is going to have to do it the hard way now. Berankis has fought back to win the first set 6-4. The exciting Naomi Osaka, meanwhile, is a set up against Germany\u2019s Laura Siegmund. The female spectator who collapsed on Court 17 has been helped to her feet and is receiving medical attention. Hopefully it\u2019s not too serious. The fact that play is about to resume is an encouraging sign. On Court 17, play has been stopped because a fan has collapsed in the stands. Petra Kvitova and Yanina Wickmayer are locked at 1-1 at the start of the second set. 2005\u2019s Richard Gasquet is in control against Yuichi Sugita, taking the first set 6-3. Back on Louis Armstrong, a swing in momentum favours Jelena Ostapenko, who battles back from a break down to take the first set 6-3 off Andrea Petkovic. Noah Rubin, the promising American youngster, has a job on his hands against the experienced Mikhail Kukushkin. The home favourite\u2019s a set down on Court 7. Petra Kvitova fights back from 0-30, earns a set point and lashes a vicious backhand past Yanina Wickmayer. She\u2019s taken the first set in 24 minutes, which will be a massive boost for her given the hot conditions. The first set of the day goes to ... China\u2019s Wang Yafan. Who had her in the sweepstake? She\u2019s taken it 6-1 against Anna Schmiedlova on Court 4. Hold that thought. Andrea Petkovic double-faults and Jelena Ostapenko breaks back for 3-3 in the first set. Elsewhere Alyson Van Uytvanck finds herself in a spot of bother against Lesia Tsurenko, who leads 4-1 against the talented Belgian. Yanina Wickmayer nets a sad forehand and Petra Kvitova breaks again to lead 4-0 in the first set on Court 17. On Louis Armstrong,meanwhile, Andrea Petkovic is dominating Jelena Ostapenko. My feed has stopped around five times in the first three games of this match. Which isn\u2019t great. Petra Kvitova races into an early lead on Court 17, breaking for 2-0. The Czech\u2019s set a fine pace already. On Louis Armstrong, Andrea Petkovic already has an early break against Jelena Ostapenko, the 10th seed. Hyeon Chung\u2019s also off to a flyer, breaking through against Ricardas Berankis. It\u2019s back. You\u2019re off the hook, Bezos. There goes my Amazon Prime feed! Bezos! The heat rule is in effect today. It only applies to the women\u2019s game and means if either player requests it, the umpire will implement a 10-minute break between the second and third sets. The main match on Amazon now is going to be Petra Kvitova versus Yanina Wickmayer. This is going to be a tricky one for Kvitova, the No5 seed, though she\u2019s been in fine form away from the grand slams this year. Players have arrived on the outside courts. Day two of the 2018 US Open is underway! They\u2019re expecting temperatures of 37C in New York today. That\u2019s sort of like a British heatwave. My Amazon Prime account is working! Daniela Hantuchova and Greg Rusedski are talking about tennis! Good old Bezos. On the women\u2019s side, the early intrigue lies in the match between Sam Stosur, the 2011 champion, and Caroline Wozniacki, the Australian Open champion. Elsewhere Angelique Kerber, the 2016 champion, looks to make up for last year\u2019s first-round loss and Johanna Konta, who\u2019s had a hugely disappointing season, meets Caroline Garcia in the third match on Grandstand. That\u2019s a horrible draw for the unseeded Konta, even though she beat the sixth seed at Wimbledon last year. On the men\u2019s side, there were notable wins for Rafa Nadal, Stan Wawrinka, Juan Martin del Potro and the returning Andy Murray yesterday. Today we get to see how Novak Djokovic\u2019s feeling as he looks to win his first US Open title since 2015. The Wimbledon champion is looking more his old self after a difficult period and is widely regarded as the favourite. All eyes are on a potential quarter-final between Djokovic and Roger Federer, who lost their Cincinnati final earlier this month. Federer, who has won\u2019t the US Open title since 2008, begins his campaign against Japan\u2019s Yoshihito Nishioka in the night session on Arthur Ashe. It\u2019s also going to be fascinating to see how Alexander Zverev fares against Peter Polansky now the young German\u2019s linked up with Ivan Lendl, Murray\u2019s old coach.

I\u2019ll be watching on Amazon Prime, so while I\u2019m hoping to bring you news from Novak Djokovic versus Marton Fucsovics, Caroline Wozniacki versus Sam Stosur, Caroline Garcia versus Johanna Konta, Margarita Gasparyan versus Angelique Kerber and Peter Polansky versus Alexander Zverev, there\u2019s a chance I\u2019ll have no choice but to spend the next few hours watching highlights of the 1977 tournament. If nothing else, at least the uncertainty over the new televisual experience lends a bit of unpredictability to proceedings, which is pretty exciting if you\u2019re willing to be like Jose Mourinho and find a silver lining in every dark cloud. No point grumbling, after all; this is how it is now. And you never know, I might yet get to watch some live tennis!
