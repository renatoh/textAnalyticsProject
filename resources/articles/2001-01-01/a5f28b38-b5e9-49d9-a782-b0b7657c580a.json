There they would have seen a demonstration of the basic art of passing and movement, or push-and-run as Spurs used to call it, accompanied by the frequent and bewildering interchanges of position which once characterised the teams of Arthur Rowe and Bill Nicholson. Unhappily for present Tottenham fans the exhibition was provided by their opponents, Ipswich reconfirming their status as the brightest new stars in the Premiership firmament with a 3-0 victory which also showed how misleading their 3-1 defeat at White Hart Lane on the season's opening day had been. As a result George Burley's side will begin the new year within striking distance of Arsenal, now only two points above them in second place. To advance they will have to beat Sunderland on Wearside today while Arsenal lose to Charlton Athletic at the Valley; a tall order but not an impossible one, given Ipswich's impressive away record and the recent poverty of Arsenal's travels. Far from aiming merely to consolidate the place they have regained in the Premiership, Ipswich are well placed to compete in next season's Uefa Cup or even the Champions League. Certainly the quality of their football would not be out of place in Europe. Naturally their manager is keeping his feet on the ground to the extent of nailing his shoes to the running track. According to Burley Ipswich now have \"a 90% chance of getting the 40-42 points which should be enough to stay up\". Given the alarming manner in which Sunderland collapsed last season, having made an even better start as a promoted side than Ipswich, Burley is probably wise to put security before celebration. Yet there is a greater depth to his side than to Peter Reid's team; the excellence of Ipswich's technique, vision and passing is universal and almost anyone is likely to score. Saturday's three goals were a delight not because of the finishing, which in each case was a tap-in, but because of the imagination that created them. Outstanding shots are good to watch but team goals bring a deeper satisfaction to players, coaches and, when they think about it, spectators. Hermann Hreidarsson, quick to exploit the absence of the injured Stephen Carr on Tottenham's right, instigated the first after nine minutes with an astutely angled pass to Matt Holland, whose low centre was missed by Alun Armstrong but diverted into the net by Marcus Stewart. The second goal, just past the hour, was a classic. Stewart exchanged quick passes with Martijn Reuser and delivered another low cross which this time found Armstrong timing his run to catch the Spurs centre-backs square and slip the ball past Neil Sullivan. The fact that Ipswich's late third goal should have been disallowed for offside - David Johnson, who had replaced Armstrong, was not only caught on the goalline when his fellow substitute Jamie Clapham shot but actually made contact with the ball - did not detract from a neat piece of improvisation in the build-up by James Scowcroft and Reuser. Nor could anyone argue that a 3-0 win for Ipswich, who also saw Sullivan tip a bicycle shot by Titus Bramble on to the crossbar and a later effort from Scowcroft denied by the same bar, accurately reflected the pattern of the game. Certainly George Graham was not contesting the justice of the result and he did not even mention the third goal. Instead the Spurs manager lamented his players' apparently unalterable habit of swapping silk cloth at home for sackcloth away. Tottenham are unbeaten in the league at White Hart Lane but have yet to win on the road. On Saturday in fact they could barely raise the energy to thumb a lift. It was nearly an hour before Richard Wright was required to stop a shot and even then Gary Doherty hardly tested his goalkeeping talents. Sullivan, on the other hand, achieved a series of saves which in theory kept Tottenham in the match but in reality merely delayed the inevitable. \"We started second best and that's the way we stayed,\" said Graham grimly before apologising to Spurs' travelling supporters for the team's performance. \"Teams associated with me don't give up as easily as this,\" he continued. \"We fight for it. \"Ipswich were nice and bright when they had the ball but off the ball they worked hard and were always competitive. We weren't. Even with the XI we had out there we should have made a better game of it.\" Presumably tomorrow night Spurs will change back from paupers to princes and beat Newcastle United at home. But they will go nowhere so long as they are only consistent in their inconsistency."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
