NHS statistics state that roughly a quarter of children aged 11 to 15 admit to having taken drugs. But a survey published yesterday found that while 22% of parents think children in their neighbourhood take drugs, only 1% think their own children have done so. The poll, commissioned by the drug and alcohol charity Addaction, indicated that young people have a far better idea of their parents' drug taking history than vice versa. One in five young people said their parents had experimented with drugs in the past. Ten per cent of young people said their parents \"still take\" drugs. That judgment conforms with government figures that find 10% of adults admit to having taken at least one illicit substance in the last year. Addaction, which today launches a \u00a310m appeal to tackle drug and alcohol misuse, said today's parents were more familiar with drugs because they grew up in the \"rave generation\" of the 1980s. But the survey indicated that parents remain naive about the drug taking behaviour of their children."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
