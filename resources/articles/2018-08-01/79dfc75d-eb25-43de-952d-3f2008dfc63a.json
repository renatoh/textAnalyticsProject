In new research presented at the Black Hat information security conference, a pair of security researchers remotely disabled an implantable insulin pump, preventing it from delivering the lifesaving medication, and then took total control of a pacemaker system, allowing them to deliver malware directly to the computers implanted in a patient\u2019s body. Jonathan Butts of QED Secure Solutions and Billy Kim Rios of Whitescope demonstrated the hacks in a live session, warning anyone with an implanted medical device to leave the room before issuing the disabling command to the insulin pump. To take control of the pacemaker, Rios and Butts went up the chain, hacking the system that a doctor would use to program a patient\u2019s pacemaker. Their hack rewrote the system to replace the background with an ominous skull, but a real hack could modify the system invisibly, while ensuring that any pacemaker connected to it would be programmed with harmful instructions. \u201cYou can obviously issue a shock,\u201d Butts said, \u201cbut you can also deny a shock.\u201d Because the devices are implanted for a reason, he added, withholding treatment can be as damaging as active attempts to harm. The pair criticised Medtronic, the manufacturer of the devices, for its response to the discoveries. \u201cWe first reported this to the manufacturer 570 days ago,\u201d Butts said. \u201cAbout 155 days ago we told them how someone could actually take it over,\u201d Rios added. The pair shared specific proof-of-concept attacks with the company, highlighting the damage that could be done. \u201cMonths ago, we hit a turning point and said \u2018enough\u2019s enough\u2019,\u201d he said, prompting them to go public with their experience at the conference. Butts and Rios also criticised Medtronic\u2019s slow response and attempts to downplay the weaknesses. In its cybersecurity alerts, the company said the attacks weren\u2019t possible remotely, and failed to fully explain how wide-ranging the weaknesses were. A bulletin warning about the weakness that Rios and Butts used to reprogram the pacemaker, for instance, said only that an attacker \u201ccould influence\u201d the data sent to its software update system. \u201cWhen someone gets this advisory and they\u2019re reading this language, it\u2019s almost impossible for them to understand what the risks are,\u201d Rios said. Medtronic has said it will not fix the flaws discovered, instead recommending patients and doctors take extra care with the networks they connect the devices to. The company says the flaws pose a \u201clow (acceptable)\u201d risk to patient safety. Suzanne Schwartz, an FDA director responsible for the agency\u2019s cybersecurity partnerships, said that the case study illustrates a \u201cgap in the ecosystem. \u201cManufacturers find themselves in different places in their ability to respond,\u201d Schwartz added. \u201cUltimately we want to make sure that these devices, that provide the extraordinary ability for patients to live good quality lives, are protected from attacks.\u201d A spokesperson for Medtronic said the company had \u201cindependently assessed\u201d the potential vulnerabilities highlighted by Whitescope and was \u201cnot aware of any additional vulnerabilities they have identified at this time\u201d. \u201cMedtronic places product safety above all considerations,\u201d the company added. \u201cAll devices carry some associated risk and, like the regulators, we continuously strive to balance the risks against the benefits our devices provide.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
