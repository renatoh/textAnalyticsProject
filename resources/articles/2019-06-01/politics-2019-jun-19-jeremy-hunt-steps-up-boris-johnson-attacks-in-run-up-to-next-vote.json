Stewart, who came fourth in Tuesday afternoon\u2019s second round of voting, told the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show his team had held discussions with Gove\u2019s aides, despite their differences over Brexit tactics. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about combining forces, because it\u2019s clear that Boris is going into the last round and the question is, who is best placed to sit on the stage with Boris Johnson and who is best placed to ask the testing questions that need to be asked and who has the vision of Britain that is going to excite people, get young people involved again in politics, and show us that we can build a much better country,\u201d he said. When questioned about their different stances on Brexit \u2013 Stewart says there will be no time to negotiate a revised deal, while Gove is confident this can be done by, or close to, 31 October \u2013 Stewart conceded it would need work. \u201cWe would have to sit down and come to a common position. I would have to say to him, how is it that you think you are going to get a different deal through Brussels, how would you get a no-deal through parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would have to agree to compromise. And if neither of us were prepared to budge on our analysis of the situation, then of course we couldn\u2019t combine as a team.\u201d While the latest round of voting left Johnson well ahead with 126 of the 313 votes cast, the remaining four candidates were closely clustered behind, with Jeremy Hunt on 46, Gove on 41, Stewart on 37 and Sajid Javid with 33. Dominic Raab was eliminated with 30. While Stewart did not specify who would lead such a joint ticket, a source in his camp said it would be him: \u201cClearly, at some point people will need to combine teams. But any team that gets combined, Rory wants to lead it \u2013 Rory believes that he is the only one with a chance to beat Boris in the final two, and to provide the clearest choice.\u201d However, Gove\u2019s supporters played down the idea. A source in his camp said: \u201cWe are in it to win it and obviously we would welcome the support of any candidate that wanted to drop out and support us.\u201d One key battle for the remaining candidates will be to secure some of Raab\u2019s supporters. Stewart told the BBC that he had so far gained pledges from two of them. Hunt stepped up his attacks on Johnson before the next round, questioning whether his predecessor as foreign secretary had the necessary grasp of detail, and declining to say he could be trusted. During a BBC TV debate on Tuesday, Hunt had challenged Johnson on whether or not he would force a no-deal Brexit on 31 October even if a deal looked imminent. Hunt used the example of a sheep farmer he had met, who warned that his family business would be wiped out by tariffs in the event of no deal. \u201cThe reason I asked that very direct question to Boris is because the job of prime minister is not actually about broadbrush statements,\u201d Hunt told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWe all want to leave by 31 October, we all want to have an orderly Brexit. That\u2019s the easy bit. It\u2019s actually about making finely balanced judgments on the basis of the facts in front of you.\u201d In the TV debate, Johnson said his intention, if he were prime minister, was to leave on 31 October, but he did not offer an absolute guarantee. Hunt said: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not entirely sure what he believes on this, having listened to him last night.\u201d Asked if he trusted Johnson, or whether the EU could, Hunt said he did not want to \u201cmake highly personal accusations against other candidates\u201d, but nonetheless declined to confirm this. \u201cI\u2019m going to answer it this way: I believe that they would trust Jeremy Hunt as prime minister, that they would sit round the table, they would talk to me,\u201d Hunt said. However, Hunt did not comment on the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran, whose husband, Richard, has said incorrect comments made by Johnson when he was foreign secretary had worsened her plight. \u201cI think that is for Richard Ratcliffe to comment on,\u201d Hunt said, saying it would be \u201cincredibly unseemly\u201d to use the case in the leadership race."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
