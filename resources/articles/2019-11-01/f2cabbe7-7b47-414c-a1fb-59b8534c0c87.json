But, increasingly, Australians are recognising food\u2019s impact beyond its ability to contribute to a delicious meal. Australians want to eat more sustainably. Dr Denise Hamblin, of market research firm Colmar Brunton, says there is rapid movement towards choosing food that supports a healthier planet. \u201cAs we see social values moving, we also see diet and food preferences changing,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a better way of doing things and we\u2019re courageous enough to scrap the old methods and start fresh.\u201d In fact, research shows that making good choices for our bodies is almost always better for the environment, too. So, what should be on our plates? A sustainable diet means cutting back on the sweet stuff we love and reducing some other macronutrients but there is still plenty to enjoy. This is what a sustainable diet looks like In a nutshell, we should be eating food that is more nutritious and has a smaller footprint. CSIRO researchers call this a higher quality and lower emission (HQLE) diet. Compared to eating lower quality and higher emission diets - usually those with lots of processed junk food - an HQLE diet cuts greenhouse gas emissions by almost half, CSIRO research has found. Principal Research Scientist from the CSIRO, Brad Ridoutt says \u201cDairy in Australian diets represents around 10% of the carbon footprint and around 15% of the water footprint, which in other words, means that 90% of greenhouse gas emissions are coming from other kinds of foods.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve also looked at the water footprint of plant alternatives and some have a lower water footprint, and some have a higher water footprint - so even if you stop drinking cow\u2019s milk, it\u2019s not that simple and there are trade-offs . It\u2019s best if you can consume an appropriate amount of food and avoid wasting it,\u201d he says. A sustainable diet considers the whole life cycle of food, from paddock to palate. Food production is a complex system that includes farming, logistics, processing and distribution - and that\u2019s just to get it into the store. With so many working parts, making the right choices in the supermarket aisle can be tricky. The CSIRO recommends we make three fundamental shifts: 1. Think about what your body needs and stick to it. We should be aiming for smaller serving sizes with higher value. Australians perform poorly when it comes to getting the right balance. The bigger the serving, the higher the impact on the environment \u2013 and our health. 2. Eat in line with Australian Dietary Guidelines. That means eating a wide variety of food from five groups: wholegrains; vegetables and legumes; fruit; dairy; and lean meat, fish and nuts. And it means consuming fewer chips, lollies and soft drinks. Tools such as the CSIRO Healthy Diet Score can show you how you measure up. 3. Reduce your food waste. In Australia, 3.7m tonnes of household food waste ended up in landfill in 2016-17 \u2013 that\u2019s a waste of food, but also of the environmental impact of making it. A truly sustainable diet considers every factor The food system is estimated to account for 19-29% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However, Dr Maartje Sevenster, from the CSIRO\u2019s Climate Smart Agriculture group, says the relationship between food and the environment is complicated. \u201cJust looking at the percentage contribution doesn\u2019t tell the whole story,\u201d she says. While the food industry contributes relatively high emissions, it has positive impacts, too, from employment (agriculture is the biggest employer in the world) to our mental wellbeing. With no alternative to food, it\u2019s impossible to cut emissions entirely. Instead, we need to think about how we can eat more efficiently for our health, and in a way that justifies the environmental and economic impacts. The EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet, Health says drastic changes in diet, food waste and production practices are required on a global scale. As well as having a positive impact on climate crisis, this shift would be likely to result in significant health benefits and reduce the worldwide burden of disease. The EAT-Lancet report recommends setting boundaries for food production in a number of areas, including greenhouse gas emissions, water use and cropland use. Ideally, it says, world agriculture will shift from carbon contributor to carbon sink - absorbing more than it emits. Climate health would not be the only benefit - eating this way is actually better for our bodies. Research shows that adopting an HQLE diet could reduce current adult mortality rates by as much as 23.6%. What does all of this mean for the way we eat? In Australia, farmers are finding innovative ways to be more sustainable from the very beginning of the cycle. Farming sustainably for our health and the planet\u2019s too Sevenster says sustainable agriculture has a dual benefit. \u201cIt\u2019s on the boundaries of environment and economy,\u201d she says. Farming more sustainably, through innovation and land care, often makes better financial sense, too. Dairying contributes about 1.6% of Australia\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions, and the industry has committed to keeping its nutrient-rich products on the menu while lowering its environmental impact. Dairy\u2019s sustainability goals include taking stewardship of natural resources to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% and reducing water use by 20%. It\u2019s all about striking the right balance between impact and output. This activity aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), which take an inclusive, big-picture approach to sustainability. Sustainable practice builds on itself - every innovation drives global progress forward. Your new sustainable diet will have global benefits True sustainability provides food and nutrition security for current and future generations. It meets multiple UNSDGs - not just zero hunger but also clean water and sanitation, life on land, and responsible consumption and production. Hamblin says consumers really want this level of equity, and are tired of waiting. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for absolute transparency and honesty in everything, from the animals and staff involved in creating a product, to where and how it is made and the impact on the environment,\u201d she says. \u201cSustainability starts to come out as really important because we are seeking fairness.\u201d So what is still on the menu? It\u2019s true: a sustainable diet means cutting back on the sweet stuff we love and reducing some other macronutrients but there is still plenty to enjoy - and cheese lovers will be pleased to find dairy is still on the menu. For inspiration, check out EAT forum\u2019s tasty, healthy and planet-friendly recipes. The upshot? Choose a diet that minimises your environmental impact by opting for one that is composed predominantly of foods with high nutritional value and small carbon footprint. Your body will thank you - and so will the planet. What matters to you, matters to us too. Learn more about Australian dairy from Dairy Australia."}, "isHosted": false}}}
