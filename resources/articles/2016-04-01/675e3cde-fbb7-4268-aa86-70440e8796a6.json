Last Sunday the Observer reported that the Italian-owned Parliament Hill Cafe faced closure after the City of London Corporation, which runs Hampstead Heath, had awarded the contract for the site \u2013 and two others in Highgate Wood and Golders Hill \u2013 to the upmarket chain Benugo. Alberto d\u2019Auria and his family, who had run the cafe for 33 years, faced eviction on 8 May and were running down their stocks. But, in the face of a public outcry, Benugo announced on Thursday that it was pulling out of all three bids. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing. I didn\u2019t believe it at first,\u201d said Alberto\u2019s son, Alfonso, who found out about the decision when they were contacted by a local paper. \u201cWe thought it was done and dusted. My dad is ecstatic.\u201d In a written statement, Benugo founder Ben Warner said that, as a local, he had been proud to win the contract, but that \u201chaving listened to the opinions of local residents and people who use the heath \u2026 we have paused to reconsider our position. Having given this a lot of thought, I and my colleagues now firmly believe the right thing to do is to step aside.\u201d The announcement came after a rising tide of pressure. When the Observer went to press last week, an online petition had 11,700 signatures; by the time Benugo withdrew it had more than 24,000. At a packed public meeting on Wednesday it emerged that the contracts had yet to be signed, and the corporation was urged to reconsider. The City of London Corporation\u2019s chairman, Virginia Rounding, admitted that it had failed sufficiently to take into account local feeling. Holborn and St Pancras MP Keir Starmer said it was \u201can amazing result, a real victory for local people. It\u2019s rare for a public authority to admit they\u2019ve got it wrong in this way, but it\u2019s very welcome.\u201d Kirstie McKevitt, one of the organisers of the campaign, said it was a welcome surprise. \u201cThose events can turn into a bit of a bunfight, but the City handled it really well, and it was very courageous of Virginia and Sue Ireland [the corporation\u2019s director of public spaces] to turn up like that. I think they were surprised at the level of resistance. Still, I was shocked when Benugo pulled out. At most we hoped we\u2019d open a dialogue.\u201d She added that the D\u2019Aurias shouldn\u2019t see it as an excuse to rest on their laurels: there was no guarantee they would be the owners to take the cafe forward. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a chain, or a place full of bearded brogue-wearers on their laptops. It\u2019s about creating somewhere with value for the community. But there is certainly room for improvement, whether that\u2019s with the D\u2019Aurias or another independent.\u201d A planned protest picnic at the caf\u00e9 at 1pm on Sunday will now be a celebration. Questionnaires will be handed out, to get a better sense of the kind of caf\u00e9 locals want. \u201cNow it is down to the people,\u201d says Alfonso. \u201cWhen we started this I thought it was pointless, but the customers pushed us to fight it. They\u2019ve showed us that there was a point.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
