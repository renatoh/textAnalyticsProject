Revenge is for the sacking some received as inept ministers. Ambition is the hope that a new prime minister might choose a new team for those highly paid frontbench jobs. And, sadly, the fear is of the local party members' backlash which has always been a serious political problem in the second year of a government. It is a hard fact of life for anybody entering the arena that those who have lost their council seats and income blame the manager. But what the hothouse Westminster villagers don't seem to realise is that Labour voters living in the outside world really do think that they have never had it so good. They do not turn out for local elections, but they are certainly not going mad to get rid of Blair. He has given them more cars, more jobs, more homeowners, more kids at university, more pensioners living longer, more holidays abroad, than they ever dreamed of. No wonder half of Europe wants to come and live here. Stick it out, Tony. All Gordon needs to win the next election is a 12-month honeymoon. After that the shine wears off. If Blair stands down in 2008, Labour will romp home at the next election. Joe Ashton (MP for Bassetlaw 1968-2001), Sheffield Your leader (September 4) appears to promote the myth that decisions about the Labour leadership are the responsibility of just one or two individuals. In a democratic party this is not so. As for \"proper debate ... about future direction\", successive party conferences have already debated and agreed a range of policies - eg on pensions, housing, transport and the financing of public services - which are popular both with members and the electorate. All that is now needed is a leadership candidate committed to campaign for their implementation. Francis Prideaux London Most of Labour's core vote would be hard pushed to show where Lebanon is on the map (Blair delay could provoke leadership challenge, September 2). Now that fighting has disappeared from our TV screens, the usual home-affairs polling priorities - immigration, crime and the NHS - will return. The Labour party is suffering the same debilitating illness as the Tories in the mid-90s, when a relatively small group of their eurosceptic \"bastard\" MPs continually briefed political editors against John Major's government. Voters correctly assumed the divided Conservatives had lost the will to govern and the 1997 Labour election landslide followed. If Labour MPs fracture the party to rid themselves of Blair, I'm not going to assist a party with a death wish. Martin Bell Port Isaac, North Cornwall Jackie Ashley believes there are some New Labour young turks out there who want \"to do politics differently\". Douglas Alexander and Jim Murphy are just another pair of capable (if a bit dour) apparatchiks. The notion that their ilk can transform Labour into a party with a philosophically and morally coherent left-of-centre vision is stretching credulity. Sadly the answer does not lie in policy reform by the wonkerati. It may be a tad apocalyptic but The Beast Must Die. Tom McFadyen Glasgow Blairites warn of a bloody transfer of power, citing the removal of Thatcher. Yet I remember the mixed emotions of seeing her kicked out, while fearing the Tories might just have saved their necks by removing a leader with unparalleled unpopularity. Remember 1992? Ric Carey Southsea, Hants The parliamentary Labour party seems to assume the debate about the timing of the prime minister's departure is one in which they have an exclusive interest. If MPs took serious account of their role in a representative democracy, this matter should have been resolved some time ago. Most voters have made their own position abundantly clear: the man must go and quickly. Democracy, accountability and transparency are mere rhetorical flourishes in the absence of appropriate mechanisms and action. The fact that New Labour MPs can't deliver a widely desired result calls into question their relationship with the electorate. Just do it. Who knows, we may even see the renaissance of due process, independent thinking and public virtue - essential elements if communities are to re-engage with the political process. Gus Pennington Faceby, North Yorkshire I am not one to join the baying for the demise of Tony Blair, without considering the alternatives. Why is it assumed Gordon Brown should automatically become prime minister? He has made an exceptionally good chancellor, but that does not mean to say he will fit the bill. I have serious doubts. Will some other suitable challenger step forward? Chris Shirley-Smith London Once again we see the true nature of our politicians. Do they turn on their leader because of questionable policies? No. They turn on him because their seats are at risk. Selfish to the end. Richard Bryant-Jefferies Great Bookham, Surrey Every Labour MP and member can surely foresee the lasting damage ousting Blair would do. Those with a real concern about Labour's future have to call for an orderly and controlled process now. Rory Palmer Worksop, Nottinghamshire Could it be Tony sees his legacy better nurtured by David than Gordon? If so, he may consider a short interregnum preceded by confusion and division is more likely to lead to his \"true\" successor.
