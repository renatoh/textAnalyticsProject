The column said: \"Unlike local authorities, the BBFC has no legal authority to ban films.\" However, the film's makers sought DVD certification only. As the BBFC notes: \"While we do not have legal powers where cinema films are concerned ... we do have the legal powers to reject a work for DVD. This means that it is 'banned' in the UK on DVD under the terms of the Video Recordings Act 1984.\" So our film writers were right in using this term; \"ban\" will be restored, where applicable, in online versions of the pieces (Don't ban this filth, 9 June, page 12, G2; Human Centipede 2 director criticises BBFC over ban, 7 June, theguardian.com). \u2022 Writing of Trinidadian calypso musician Lord Kitchener, an item in our seven-part History of modern music series began: \"When the Empire Windrush docked at Southampton, a new Britain was born ... The seeds of multicultural Britain were duly sewn.\" The Windrush arrived at Tilbury, and the seeds were sown (16 June, page 7, Series part six: World and folk). \u2022 A picture showed the playground of Northampton Academy but, based on agency caption material supplied to us, gave the school's location slightly improbably as Southampton (Gove's academy fanfare interrupted as mistakes in council funding are revealed, 17 June, page 18)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
