She was 95. \u201cGloria Vanderbilt was an extraordinary woman who loved life and lived it on her own terms,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cShe was a painter, a writer and designer but also a remarkable mother, wife and friend. She was 95 years old, but ask anyone close to her and they\u2019d tell you she was the youngest person they knew \u2013 the coolest and most modern.\u201d Vanderbilt died at home surrounded by friends and family, according to CNN. Gloria Laura Morgan Vanderbilt was born on 24 February 1924 and lived a storied life from infancy. Her father was the renowned rake Reginald Vanderbilt, the great-grandson of the railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt. Her mother, who married in her teens, was more of a party girl than an attentive parent. When Gloria was 18 months old, her father died of cirrhosis of the liver, aged just 45. She received a $5m trust fund which her mother used to fund a lavish socialite lifestyle full of travel and affairs. Gloria\u2019s paternal aunt, the sculptor Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, founder of the Whitney Museum of American Art, ultimately sued for custody of the little girl, resulting in her becoming the most famous American child of her time. The 1934 trial in the case became a tabloid sensation trial that resulted in Gloria being called a \u201cpoor little rich girl\u201d amid bitter family drama. \u201cFor five hours Mrs Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt \u2026 listened to a tight-lipped nurse denounce her with virtual relish as a cocktail-crazed dancing mother, a devotee of sex erotica and the mistress of a German prince \u2026 it was a blistering tale no skin lotion could soothe,\u201d Town &amp; Country reported. The courtroom devolved into chaos when a French maid testified that \u201cMrs Vanderbilt was in bed reading a paper and there was [the royal] Lady Milford Haven beside the bed with her arm around Mrs Vanderbilt\u2019s neck and kissing her just like a lover\u201d. The judge ejected the press. After seven weeks of testimony, he awarded custody to Whitney. In 2016, Vanderbilt told the Associated Press the \u201cpoor little rich girl\u201d moniker \u201cbothered me enormously \u2026 I didn\u2019t see any of the press, the newspapers were kept from me. I didn\u2019t know what it meant. I didn\u2019t feel poor and I didn\u2019t feel rich. It really did influence me enormously to make something of my life when I realized what it meant.\u201d Her foray into the world of fashion started at age 15 as a Harper\u2019s Bazaar model and at 17, after spending seven years with the \u201crigid\u201d Gertrude, she moved to Hollywood. Vanderbilt dated stars and vowed to marry the aviation and movie mogul Howard Hughes, but instead wed his press agent, Pasquale di Cicco. The marriage caused Whitney to write Gloria out of her will. Gloria, who came into her trust at age 21, in 1945, wound up divorcing Di Cicco, claiming routine beatings. One day later she married a 63-year-old conductor, Leopold Stokowski. They had two sons and their marriage lasted a decade. Her next two marriages were to the film director Sidney Lumet and the writer Wyatt Emory Cooper. Other romances included Frank Sinatra, whom she described as \u201ckind of just the most amazing person in my life\u201d, Errol Flynn and Marlon Brando. \u201cI\u2019ve had many, many loves,\u201d Vanderbilt told the Associated Press in 2004. \u201cI always feel that something wonderful is going to happen. And it always does.\u201d Vanderbilt married Lumet in 1956 and lived with him and her children in a 10-room duplex penthouse on Gracie Square in New York. She divorced him to marry Cooper in 1963. Their elder son, Carter, a Princeton graduate and editor at American Heritage, killed himself in 1988 at age 23, leaping from his mother\u2019s 14th-floor apartment as she tried to stop him. Vanderbilt\u2019s fame increased dramatically in the late 1970s, when she partnered with the clothing-maker Mohan Murjani to sell designer jeans that featured her name on the back pockets \u2013 a move that earned $10m in 1980, Bloomberg noted. After her success in designer jeans, Vanderbilt branched out into shoes, scarves, table and bed linens, designer fragrances and china, through her company, Gloria Concepts. Her wide-ranging career also included art, as well as memoir and fiction writing. At 85 she wrote an erotic novel called Obsession which told the story of a woman becoming obsessed with her deceased husband\u2019s relationship with a dominatrix. Excerpts leaked to a tabloid sent shockwaves through the New York elite. The New York Post columnist Andrea Peyser described the 143-page book as \u201cpure, elegant, unadulterated smut\u201d that could be \u201ceasily read with one hand\u201d. But Vanderbilt told the New York Times she wasn\u2019t embarrassed at all. \u201cI don\u2019t think age has anything to do with what you write about,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only thing that would embarrass me is bad writing, and the only thing that really concerned me was my children. You know how children can be about their parents. But mine are very intelligent and supportive.\u201d Cooper was also unfazed. \u201cI\u2019m often surprised by my mom but am always supportive of anything she does,\u201d the CNN anchor said. \u201cShe\u2019s totally unique and cool.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
