The Premiership leaders are still optimistic about adding the Frenchman to their payroll when the transfer window re-opens in January. For that to happen Saha, having spoken of his desire to go to Old Trafford, will have to agitate for a move. Fulham's manager Chris Coleman insisted the player would leave \"over my dead body\" and the London club seem unwilling to entertain the idea unless they receive an offer upwards of \u00a310m. \"The club can confirm it has received unsolicited and unwelcome inquiries from a number of clubs, including Manchester United,\" said Fulham's chief executive Jim Hone. \"However it has been made clear to those clubs that Fulham does not wish, and has no financial requirement, to sell the player, who is under contract until 2006. It is not in our plans to sell a player whose value to Fulham far exceeds any current offer.\" Whether that is enough to deter United remains to be seen, particularly as they know Saha wants to join them. Ferguson's admiration for the player extends well beyond this season, first inquiring about his availability during Peter Kenyon's time as chief executive last season. \"We are looking [for a new striker] and it's not beyond the realms of possibility,\" the United manager said last night. High among Ferguson's considerations is that his potential transfer targets should be available for the Champions League, requiring them not to have played in either that competition or the Uefa Cup. Saha fits that bill, as does Jermain Defoe of West Ham and Mark Viduka and Alan Smith of Leeds. A striker is Ferguson's priority regardless of Rio Ferdinand's eight-month ban for missing a drugs test and, in a move that will delight the club's corporate backers, he is close to finalising a \u00a31.5m-deal for Dong Fangzhou, an 18-year-old forward with Dalian Shide of China. About the only certainty is that any new arrivals at Old Trafford next month will be linking up with Van Nistelrooy, rather than replacing him. To Ferguson's disquiet, Madrid appear to have been wooing the prolific striker through the media recently, much as they did with David Beckham. United are worried that Madrid's president Florentino Perez is apparently briefing journalists about his desire to make Van Nistelrooy his latest signing. United's directors have subsequently accelerated their negotiations with Van Nistelrooy and his Dutch agent Rodger Linse about a deal that elevates him from the middle reaches of the club's earners to the top bracket alongside Roy Keane and Ryan Giggs. Van Nistelrooy has given his word and the contract should be signed in the next fortnight. \"You can't get upset about it,\" said Ferguson of Madrid's tactics. \"They are renowned for it. It's happened with all their signings - not just with Beckham but with Ronaldo, Figo, Zidane. More importantly, I can assure you I'm trying my best to make sure it won't happen again. We have to put it to one side and concentrate on our relationship with Ruud, which is very good. Ruud is very happy here, I've had a chat with him and we're on the point of signing his new contract. He's still got 2 years left of his present deal anyway, and he's a Manchester United player.\" The offer for Saha stems from Ferguson's dread that, with Ole Gunnar Solksjaer already sidelined, an injury to Van Nistelrooy would be a critical setback to United's season. Ferguson traditionally likes to have four strikers and, privately, there are lingering reservations about Diego Forlan's ability to trouble Europe's most accomplished defenders. \"I'm not surprised, to be truthful,\" said Coleman. \"Louis is a terrific player and has been banging in the goals. But it doesn't matter which club comes in for him, we don't want him to go. The chairman has told me we don't have to sell any of our players. \"He's invaluable to the club and even if we got \u00a320m for him we wouldn't sell because we would then have to find another striker halfway through the season and it would take him time to settle in. It's too disruptive.\" Hone added: \"Louis has consistently maintained that he is happy at Fulham FC and understands the importance of playing regular first-team football at this stage in his career. \"Neither the club nor Louis believes it would be beneficial for his future, to become a squad member elsewhere. Media speculation surrounding any player can become unsettling and is not welcome; Louis is very much part of our future and is simply not for sale at this stage.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
