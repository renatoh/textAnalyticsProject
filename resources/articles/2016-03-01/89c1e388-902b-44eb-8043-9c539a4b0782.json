Leicester\u2019s inability to beat the league\u2019s 13th-placed side means Tottenham Hotspur can move to the top of the table if they beat West Ham United on Wednesday, but Ranieri said he felt better about his team\u2019s chances than he had been after the 1-0 win against Norwich City on Saturday. \u201cIt was a fantastic match and I am very pleased with our performance,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cIt was just the goal that was missing but we created a lot of chances. We were a little unlucky but I am more confident now than after the game against Norwich. \u201cAgainst Norwich, we won the game at the end but we created very few chances. Tonight we created a lot of chances but we drew the match. It is OK \u2013 four points from two difficult matches, it is fantastic. We are alive and our spirit is ready to fight again. I am happy \u2013 not that we didn\u2019t get the three points, but our performance was fantastic.\u201d Leicester had gone behind to Salomon Rondon\u2019s 12th-minute strike before fighting back to lead 2-1 at half\u2011time through Danny Drinkwater\u2019s deflected shot and a goal from Andy King. Craig Gardner\u2019s free-kick pulled West Brom level early in the second half and Tony Pulis acclaimed his team\u2019s \u201cheroic defending\u201d during a late onslaught from the league leaders. \u201cWe didn\u2019t panic after the first goal and we managed the ball very well,\u201d Ranieri added. \u201cWe built the pressure from the back and our fans were behind us. We scored twice and if we had just a little more luck we would have won the match. Of course, the players were not so happy but I told my players that we are alive and we made a fantastic performance. There is Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester City who fight for the title, and then there is little Leicester, who are fighting against them. I want you to remember where we started.\u201d Leicester, 5,000-1 rank outsiders at the start of the season, have been top of the league for almost six weeks and Pulis turned his post-match press conference into a long eulogy about their season. \u201cLeicester City are an old-fashioned team in some ways,\u201d Pulis said. \u201cThey play through the pitch quickly, they get the ball wide and they get bodies in the box. They play really exciting football. \u201cThe way the team is set up, the balance, the enthusiasm, the commitment, every Leicester City supporter should be proud of their team. They\u2019re fantastic \u2013 their effort, their energy, they never stop. We\u2019ve done brilliantly and it\u2019s a fantastic point for us but now the game\u2019s over I hope Leicester win the league. I am supporting Leicester from now until the end of the season.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
