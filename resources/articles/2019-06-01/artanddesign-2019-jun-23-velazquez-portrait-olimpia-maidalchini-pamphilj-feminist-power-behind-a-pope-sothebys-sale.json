But now a portrait of one of history\u2019s most formidable women by one of the world\u2019s greatest painters has been rediscovered \u2013 and it will go under the hammer next month. The Portrait of Olimpia Maidalchini Pamphilj, painted in the mid-17th century by the Spanish master Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, has undergone painstaking authentication and conservation by Sotheby\u2019s since it was brought to the auction house\u2019s Amsterdam office 18 months ago. With an estimated price of \u00a32m-\u00a33m, it could be bought by either a private collector or a world-class museum. \u201cVel\u00e1zquez is one of the absolute stand-out titans of European and world painting. This portrait is unquestionably of interest to scholars and admirers of Vel\u00e1zquez alike,\u201d said James Macdonald, Sotheby\u2019s senior specialist in Old Master paintings. It is also a rare depiction of the most influential, avaricious and manipulative woman in 17th-century Rome. Olimpia Maidalchini Pamphilj was the power behind the papal throne, and the reputed lover as well as sister-in-law of Pope Innocent X. Nicknamed Papessa \u2013 the lady pope \u2013 Donna Olimpia was an ardent feminist, championing Rome\u2019s prostitutes and nuns alike. She was a \u201cbaroque rock star\u201d, according to Eleanor Herman, author of Mistress of the Vatican: the True Story of Olimpia Maidalchini. \u201cWomen from all over the Catholic world came to Rome to station themselves outside her palace and cheer as her carriage rolled out. \u201cThey could not believe that a female from modest beginnings had risen to such heights, running the nation of the Papal States and the Catholic church, an institution where women were not \u2013 and still are not \u2013 allowed any power at all.\u201d Donna Olimpia determined foreign policy and chose cardinals. Kings and queens across Europe sent gifts of gold and diamonds to curry favour. No decision was taken by Pope Innocent before consulting his sister-in-law. \u201cPeople in Rome hung banners over the pope\u2019s name on public buildings that read Pope Olimpia I. Medals were minted showing her wearing the papal tiara and sitting on the throne of St Peter,\u201d said Herman. But the men of the papal court despised and feared her. One cardinal deplored the \u201cmonstrous power of a woman in the Vatican\u201d. Another contemporary said that never before had a pope allowed himself to be \u201cso absolutely governed by a woman\u201d. Another cardinal said that the government of Rome was \u201cin the hands of a whore\u201d. Roman artists, musicians, playwrights and sculptors enjoyed her patronage. She was behind the commissioning of the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, the extravagant fountain in the Piazza Navona that is today a major tourist attraction. \u201cShe was a woman of fierce passions, keen intelligence and great charm, who protected weaker women against the injustices of men. She was also greedy, calculating and at times chillingly cold,\u201d said Herman. Soon after her death from bubonic plague in 1657, the Catholic church \u201cmoved to eradicate the scandalous memory of this audacious woman who had ruled them all\u201d. Several years earlier, Vel\u00e1zquez had made his second trip to Rome, during which Donna Olimpia sat for the master. \u201cHer character was captured in this portrait \u2013 you can see she was a pretty stern individual,\u201d said Macdonald. Ownership of the portrait \u2013 a companion to Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s Cardinal Camillo Massimi, which now hangs at Kingston Lacy, a National Trust house in Dorset \u2013 was meticulously documented until 1724. \u201cThen the trace went cold,\u201d said Macdonald. Now it is known that the painting ended up in the Netherlands, where in the 1980s it was offered at auction as the work of \u201canonymous, Dutch school\u201d. It was bought by a private collector, who bequeathed it to its present owner. \u201cWhen they brought the painting to us [Sotheby\u2019s in Amsterdam], they had absolutely no idea it was by Vel\u00e1zquez,\u201d said Macdonald. \u201cBut a colleague noticed a cypher and inventory number hidden on the back. I saw the painting soon after, and it was clear to me pretty quickly that, although it had suffered over the years, it was the long-lost Vel\u00e1zquez portrait of Donna Olimpia.\u201d Sotheby\u2019s showed the painting to Vel\u00e1zquez experts in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Macdonald recalled: \u201cBit by bit, the jigsaw fell into place. It was incredibly exciting. Everyone who saw it was amazed that this picture, long deemed lost and thought probably to have been destroyed, had actually risen from the ashes.\u201d The painting will be offered at a Sotheby\u2019s sale of Old Masters in London on 3 July, alongside works by Gainsborough, Constable, Turner, Rubens, Botticelli and Brueghel, collectively estimated to be worth up to \u00a366m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
