Watford's manager joined in applauding a team he describes as \"absolutely mind-blowing\" Watford face United in the last four of the FA Cup at Villa Park on Saturday, a match pitting the Premiership's top against bottom, but Boothroyd insists his side can reach the Wembley final next month.\"It's a semi-final and there have been shocks before,\" he said. \"It would be a major shock beyond belief, up there with a man landing on the moon\". Boothroyd believes a repeat of United's \"mesmerising\" performance would make them unstoppable but feels Watford should take credit for progressing so far in the Cup. \"To get to this stage is a real pat on that back for the players and everybody connected with the club,\" he said. \"A lot of teams would be down and out with the white flag up, but we aren't. It's going to be hellish at times [on Saturday]. But you've always got a chance.\" Leicester have appointed Nigel Worthington as caretaker manager for the final five matches of the season after Rob Kelly's 15-month reign ended with the sack. Worthington's first game is at home to his former club, Norwich, on Saturday. Barnsley and Birmingham have been charged by the Football Association after the mass confrontation involving players and officials at the end of Monday's game. Reading's striker Leroy Lita has been charged with violent conduct after an incident on Monday at Charlton involving the defender Talal El Karkouri."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
