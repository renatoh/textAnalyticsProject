Sturridge has appeared in only 18 of Liverpool\u2019s 52 matches this season because of a variety of injuries and misses Saturday\u2019s trip to West Bromwich Albion with the hip problem that forced him out of the FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa. Rodgers is unsure when the England international will be next available. The 25-year-old\u2019s fitness record has compounded Liverpool\u2019s problems in attack having sold Luis Su\u00e1rez to Barcelona and failed to sign a replacement suited to Rodgers\u2019 preferred style of play. Finally remedying that glaring weakness is a priority for the Liverpool manager in the summer and he admits Sturridge\u2019s reliability has to be factored into planning for next season. Asked whether Sturridge can be considered as Liverpool\u2019s main striker for next season given his injury problems, Rodgers replied: \u201cHe\u2019s not fit and once he can show that consistency and fitness, you can see in his performance level that it\u2019s a high one. But obviously he has missed a lot of the season so we need to assess it. Either way, if he\u2019s not available, we need to have that support.\u201d Rodgers added: \u201cWe have to hope with Daniel that this year was just an unlucky season and he can come back super-fit and super-strong because he has an immense talent. You can\u2019t argue with that. He can be as good as any striker in the world with his talent.\u201d Nevertheless, Rodgers admits adding a top-class goalscorer will be essential to correcting this season\u2019s faults. He said pointedly: \u201cI need one that is going to be playing and at a top level every week.\u201d Sturridge and Su\u00e1rez scored 52 Premier League goals between them last season as Rodgers\u2019 team came close to winning Liverpool\u2019s first championship since 1990. This term the established forwards \u2013 Sturridge, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini \u2013 have produced eight league goals in total. Raheem Sterling is the leading Premier League goalscorer with seven as Liverpool\u2019s goal ratio has plummeted from an average of 2.66 per game last season (101 in 38 league games) to 1.47 per game this campaign (47 in 32 matches). \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d said Rodgers of Liverpool\u2019s struggle to retain a Champions League place. \u201cWe haven\u2019t scored enough goals this year. If the sequence goes on we are on course to be around 60 goals down on last year. That\u2019s a huge amount. I came in the season before and we had 49 goals, so you\u2019re taking nearly a season of goals out of the team. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, we need more of a scoring threat. We missed it immensely this year and obviously that has affected results. I think what the players have done to arrive where we have is credit to them without that. So in the summer we have to try and find goals again. We looked last summer and certainly will again this summer. If we do that we have an opportunity again for next season to be like our second year.\u201d Liverpool were unable to land Alexis S\u00e1nchez, their manager\u2019s first choice to replace Su\u00e1rez, when they had the lure of Champions League football to offer potential targets last summer. The team are fifth in the Premier League with six matches to play. Rodgers expects more outgoings than incomings at Anfield this summer as he focuses on adding a few proven talents to the spine of his side. He believes Liverpool can compete against wealthier rivals in the transfer market regardless of where the team finish in the table. \u201cThey are not easy to find,\u201d he said of proven goalscorers. \u201cBut that is our job. We have to find a way to attract them here. However long I am here or not, Liverpool is a huge attraction for any player so that\u2019s something we will fight hard to do in the summer. It can make a huge difference. If you look at teams who are successful they will have that consistent striker and what that gives the rest of team is crucial. You saw it here with Su\u00e1rez \u2013 the impact that kind of striker can have.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
