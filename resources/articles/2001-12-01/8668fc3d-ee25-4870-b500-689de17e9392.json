The leading six boats finished within nine hours of one another and none had come through the Southern Ocean and the notorious Bass Strait unscathed. The German yacht Illbruck, which was in severe danger of sinking on the first night out of Cape Town, was first home, beating its Swedish rival Seb by 73 minutes. Third was Australia's News Corp, skippered by Britain's Jez Fanstone. Huge waves in the Southern Ocean had been extremely punishing and, after the frustrations of the calms off Western Australia, the fleet had to go back into the Roaring Forties and endure the rigours of Bass Strait, where six sailors died in the 1998 Sydney-Hobart Race. Many of the crews in this race needed emergency treatment. A split skull on one boat was stitched by the sailmaker, who had taken a medical course especially for the race. Cracked ribs were commonplace. The worst casualty appears to be Grant Dalton, skipper of Amer Sports One, which was fifth into Sydney. The New Zealander, with six round-the-world races under his belt, was thrown across the boat by a wave only 24 hours before the finish. Dalton, who sustained broken ribs and severe bruising, was confined to his bunk by the on-board qualified doctor, the navigator Roger Nilson, until the boat was alongside the customs berth. In obvious pain, he left the boat on a stretcher and was taken to the Royal Prince Alfred hospital for treatment and was detained overnight. He said he was injured after being thrown into the side of the boat when it fell off a wave during a gale in Bass Strait. \"I was in the galley area and I was suddenly launched into space,\" he said. \"I broke the stove and the fitting that held it to the bulkhead and slammed into the side of boat.\" The intensity of the competition had forced the crews to push their boats harder than ever before and carry more sail than they should, resulting in spectacular wipe-outs. Boats put mast and sails in the water and came up \"shaking them selves like dogs\", according to more than one skipper. In Sydney, Illbruck's captain John Kostecki said the first night out of Cape Town was so frightening that \"for two hours we weren't thinking anything about racing, we were surviving\". In 35-knot winds the boat was \"very much out of control as water gushed through the broken hatch. It was down by the bow by about 25 degrees. We were stopped dead in the water until we were able to bail out the ton or more of water.\" Illbruck restarted 20 miles behind the rest but took the lead two days from the finish. Seb, the previous leader, broke the 24-hour record for the race on November 20, clocking 460.4 miles in the Southern Ocean. Her skipper Gunnar Krantz told of the spectacular way in which Seb lost the lead, broaching with a masthead spinnaker and lying with mast and sails flat on the water in a 45-knot gust in the Bass Strait. \"It was crazy, fascinating, definitely dangerous and everything was on the edge,\" he said. \"Illbruck passed us and put seven miles between us,\" he added. \"You are heavily punished for any mistake in this race.\" Illbruck, which also won the first leg from Southampton to Cape Town, is overall leader with a maximum 16 points, followed by News Corp (12), Amer Sports One (11) and Seb (10). The next leg - from Sydney to Auckland, via Hobart - begins on Boxing Day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
