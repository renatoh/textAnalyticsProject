About 5.5 million British citizens are estimated to live outside the UK, with at least 1.2 million of these living in other EU countries, but only a fraction are on the electoral roll. Anyone who was registered in a UK constituency during the past 15 years is entitled to vote in British elections, but half of British expats are not aware of this fact. A survey of eligible voters by the Electoral Commission, the non-partisan body that oversees elections, found that 30% of people were unsure about the rights of overseas voters, while 20% thought, wrongly, that they were not allowed to vote. The commission surveyed 4,700 people, but mostly those living in Europe, meaning the survey is not representative of all British overseas voters. At the 2015 general election, only 106,000 Britons abroad were on the register, although that number has jumped by 80,000 since mid-March, when a voter-registration drive began. Britons living in other EU countries would be among the most affected by Britain leaving the union. Settling the status of their acquired rights would be \u201ca complex and daunting\u201d task, a cross-party committee in the House of Lords warned last week. David Lidington, the Europe minister, told the Observer in February that the right of British citizens to live and work in other EU countries would be at risk if Britain left the EU. \u201cEverything we take for granted about access to the single market, trade without customs checks, or paperwork at national frontiers, the right of British citizens to go and live in Spain or France: all those would all be up in the air \u2026 It is massive what is at risk.\u201d Shortly afterwards, Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, called on the leave campaign to explain what would happen to the 2 million Britons living in other EU countries. The government estimates that 2 million British citizens live elsewhere in the EU, although other figures by the UN and the Institute for Public Policy Research put the number at just 1.2 million. The data on the total number of expatriate Britons is also uncertain: the IPPR found 5.5 million Britons live abroad, while the World Bank puts the total at 4.7m. The Electoral Commission says it is easier than ever to register to vote, as applicants can now complete the process online in five minutes. Overseas voters are advised to register before 16 May if they want a postal vote, although those who want to appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf have until 7 June. \u201cThe EU Referendum is going to be a significant event and we know lots of British expats will want to make their voices heard, which is why we\u2019re urging them to get registered to vote,\u201d said Alex Robertson, director of communications at the Electoral Commission. There was \u201csome concern\u201d, he added, that overseas voters may not be able to vote by post in time, based on their experience in the 2015 general election. \u201cIf they register to vote by 16 May it should be easier to vote by post, as postal votes for the referendum will be sent out earlier than usual, giving them a bit more time to receive, complete and return their ballot pack to the UK. Of course, if they don\u2019t think they can return their postal vote papers in time or they find themselves applying after 16 May they can consider voting by proxy.\u201d Two disenfranchised British expats launched an appeal against a court ruling that denies them a vote in the upcoming referendum. Second world war veteran Harry Shindler, who lives in Italy, and lawyer Jacquelyn MacLennan, a resident of Belgium, are not entitled to vote because they have lived abroad for more than 15 years. The high court last month rejected their legal challenge, concluding that the government was entitled to adopt a cut-off period \u201cat which extended residence abroad might indicate a weakening of ties with the United Kingdom\u201d. Lawyers for Shindler and MacLennan are launching an urgent appeal as the referendum day draws near. The case will be heard under a fast-track process by three judges in the court of appeal: the master of the rolls, Lord Dyson, sitting with Lord Justice Elias and Lady Justice King."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
