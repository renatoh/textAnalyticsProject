People want kids, people have kids, so they are balancing all types of things. When you see Jessica Ennis, Dina Asher-Smith or Nicola Adams you think: \u2018God, if they can do it then I can.\u2019 You want to see everyone win.\u201d After Adams\u2019s retirement, Stokes was keen to highlight the boxer\u2019s contribution. \u201cAs a black female she has been really good [for all of us],\u201d said the 27-year-old. \u201cShe has shown people you can do what you want to do. She is just like anyone else, a young woman with dreams. She got out of bed the same as everyone. \u201cIt just shows that it doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re from, or what your background is, if you put the hard work in, put your mind to it, that you can do it. She has done a lot for women in boxing \u2013 one of the first to go pro \u2013 and then you have got loads of other female boxers coming through. She gave everyone hope.\u201d England inspired 11.7 million viewers to tune in to the BBC for their World Cup semi-final defeat by USA, and Wembley offers a further opportunity to put the Lionesses front and centre of the sporting conversation. Stokes is proud of how they are helping fuel the growth of women\u2019s sport more broadly. \u201cWe all want to win and sometimes that doesn\u2019t happen but you do need to remind yourself that there is a bigger picture: you are inspiring people, giving women hope,\u201d said Stokes, who is more used to Wembley than some, having played in two FA Cup finals. \u201cIn rugby there is talk of better resources and that kind of stuff. You can see conversations are starting, people are planting the seeds and that is what you want. It is massive for women\u2019s sport and if people can keep pushing, every little bit, it will help.\u201d She hopes the work being done by the Football Association to promote and drive investment in the women\u2019s game, as well as the role former players have played, will show other federations what is possible. \u201cIn Australia, they\u2019ve introduced equal pay. It takes time. We are in a very fortunate position at the minute but it is because of what people have done in the past, not because of what we have done. It is so important we keep pushing it, hold ourselves accountable for good performances and getting people in the stadiums.\u201d Phil Neville is pushing them to up the tempo. \u201cHe is challenging us,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cWe know we want to be fitter, we want to be technically better. There are things happening behind the scenes that people might not necessarily see but there is a lot going on and we are being challenged as individuals and as a squad to be better.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
