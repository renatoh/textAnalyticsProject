Trump has publicly berated Powell and the Fed and explicitly called on the central bank to cut rates, an unprecedented move that challenges the Fed\u2019s supposed independence from political interference. Powell refused to be drawn further on Trump\u2019s comments saying he does not \u201cdiscuss elected officials publicly or privately\u201d. \u201cAt the Fed, we\u2019re deeply committed to carrying out our mission and also that our independence from direct political control we see as an important institutional feature that has served both the economy and the country well,\u201d he said. His comments came a day after it emerged Trump had discussed demoting Powell. Trump has also previously praised China\u2019s central bank, which is controlled by the government, and said the US economy would be doing better \u201cif we had somebody different\u201d at the Fed. The Fed did not give in to pressure to change rates, leaving the federal-funds rate in a range between 2.25% and 2.5% But the Fed said \u201cuncertainties\u201d about the economic outlook had increased, signalling there may be rate rises to come in the near future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
