Yesterday the millennium cohort study reported on how they were doing at the age of three. In time, we shall know how they fare on their journey through school, college and life. It's far too early to tell, but we will eventually know if Labour made a difference. Long after Blair and Brown are gone, this is where Labour's real legacy will be etched. The millennium cohort will follow 15,500 children until their dying day. It mirrors studies of the babies born in 1958 and 1970; these tell us more than any other research about society then and now, how habits and attitudes change, how socially mobile Britain is and what seems to cause good or bad health and happiness in later life. These really are the crown jewels of social research. But this week's report doesn't make particularly encouraging reading for the government. After Labour had been six years in power, still 26% of all three-year-old children were poor - and the difference in attainment between the poor and the middle classes was stark, with the poorest nearly a year behind those from homes with graduate parents. Can they ever catch up? Past evidence would suggest most won't, unless the better schools now and new remedial programmes Gordon Brown promises catch them in time. True, these are 2003 figures. There may be slightly fewer poor children now and more Sure Start programmes. But the findings are no surprise. With great effort Labour has started to reverse the social calamity of the 1980s, when child poverty sprang up from 1:7 children in 1979 to the 1:3 they inherited in 1997. Investing heavily in tax credits and social programmes, it has now fallen to a quarter. But hardly a week goes by without an authoritative report finding the same - each one analysing the damage and dysfunction caused by inequality. The recent Unicef report put Britain bottom for the health, happiness and wellbeing of children. Last month a Barnados report showed the desperate hardship of bringing up children on a pittance. Even though the poverty threshold for a parent and two children is just \u00a3223 a week, the millennium report shows that 72% of children of lone parents still fall below it. Next week Rowntree reports on the fate of tens of thousands of 16-year-olds leaving school unqualified. Whichever way you look at it, for as long as Britain remains so unequal, battalions more children here than in other countries are destined to fail. What can be done? The Institute for Fiscal Studies and others show it needs nearly \u00a34bn to reach the halfway mark in 2010 and \u00a328bn to abolish child poverty by 2020. Since single parenthood is a prime cause, that means absent fathers must be made to pay: many might if mothers could keep all that fathers handed over, regardless of credits and benefits. Lone parents need priority-free Sure Start childcare places so their children get every help very young, regardless of whether mothers work. Professor Heather Joshi, director of the millennium cohort, says Bangladeshi and Pakistani children do so exceptionally badly because many have young, newly arrived, rural and uneducated mothers. Second generation children do better, but not when families keep starting all over again by bringing in new, uneducated non-English speakers. That's a challenge for migration policy. Some countries raise the age for foreign spouses to deter just this or else risk their social programmes making no measurable progress. Beyond more money, Labour knows exactly what to do. Sure Start children's centres in every community point the way, catching babies from birth with intensive health visiting to find depressed mothers and families in trouble. Early help with play, talk and parenting works. \"Early Talk\", \"Every Child a Reader\" and \"Every Child Counts\" are excellent programmes that rescue young children who are not talking, reading or counting at the right age. It's all there, every programme that works with hard evidence of success. It's not too late - quite - for Labour's millennium babies who have already fallen behind, but it needs big money and unflagging diligence. It needs a large dowry on the head of every child at risk, to see each one gets most spent on them all through their school years. That's not happening. In Sheerness, a poor white district with the UK's most single parents, Seashells is a purpose-built Sure Start opened two years ago. It serves 850 children with a budget of \u00a3750,000, providing all kinds of intensive professional help alongside local mothers who help run it. But next March, when another 10 centres are due to open and the funding is devolved from Whitehall down to Kent county council, Seashells will get only \u00a3200,000 - enough to run the building but with very few of the vital services inside it. Councils have been ordered to expand Sure Start fivefold on less than double the money. The myth was spread that it was \"overfunded\", but damaged children need intensive professional help. John Prescott's disastrous devolution legacy abandoned Sure Start to local discretion: he handed over Sure Start funds with no ringfencing. Most councils are Tory or Lib Dem, many with little interest in Sure Start. Unless Gordon Brown finds a lot of money, fast, and ringfences it firmly, Sure Start could become Labour's great might-have-been. Kent's priorities are already clear - it gives more per capita to grammars than to secondary moderns. But in all areas, the cries of pain from this fledgling programme show it's nowhere near being a universal service yet with enough power to kickstart social mobility. Prof Joshi reckons it will be years before a real evaluation can prove Sure Start's success. But there are early clues. In Sheerness, within a year, the number of children admitted to A&amp;E fell by 71%, breastfeeding doubled, so has children's membership of the library. The local primary head says it's very clear which parents and children have been through Sure Start. But it needs years more enthusiasm and high investment. Anyone visiting a Sure Start is struck by the stories mothers tell of what it has done for them, the depressed, the isolated and those able to work for the first time. Will this - and any future government - keep its nerve amid years of inconclusive evidence? And Labour needs to engage voters on inequality if it wants different results to flow from future reports. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
