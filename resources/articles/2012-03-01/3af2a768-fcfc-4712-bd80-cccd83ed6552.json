Actually, I am not even sure I know what I mean, but I like the expression and henceforth shall be using it at every available opportunity. It cropped up on Sunday morning on Man v Food on Dave, when host Adam Richman visited a doughnut shop in Portland, Oregon, serving delicacies like the peanut butter and bacon doughnut which go some way towards explaining why visitors from America sometimes need two seats on the tube. The owner of the shop was extolling the virtues of another speciality, the hot buttermilk bar, which, he said, could \"really put your shorts in a knot\", were you to \"hang a fang\" on it. Man v Food is one of those programmes of which there seems to be an inexhaustible supply. It is showing on at least three channels, but mostly on Dave, where I think something very sinister is going on. As an inveterate flipper, I regularly encounter Dave on my travels, invariably catching an episode of Mock The Week or QI, often ones I have never seen before. I may be wrong but I am sure they have shown more episodes of these shows than were ever made. I think Dave is cloning shows. Maybe, behind the scenes at Dave, it is like one of those anti-communist paranoid fantasies that occasionally surfaced in TV shows and movies in the 1950s, where the Soviets would capture some genius scientist from the West and brainwash him into doing their evil world-domination work. Dave, I reckon, has got one of these horn-rimmed bespectacled, white\u2011coated marvels in its basement right now, with a computer the size of a kitchen, magnetic tape whirring madly. They will be holding a gun to his head until he generates enough Stephen Fry and Dara O Briain to last for years. We can only hope they don't get hold of a copy of Two Pints of Lager. If Dave trades on its ability to take us to places we have been before many times, the same is true of football at this time of year. I fear, though, that Match of the Day may have gone a little too early with its annual Agony of Relegation from the Premier League show. In the match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers, there were rather too many cutaways of Wolves fans in the stands, looking depressed and anxious, biting nails and so on, followed by the obligatory shot of fans trooping disconsolately out of the ground five minutes from the end. We also had a short sequence of angry fans outside the ground voicing their discontent with the owners. This stuff should be left till the last day. MOTD will have nowhere to go, when relegation actually occurs, unless they are fortunate enough to get the money shot: a male fan, too heartbroken to move, sitting head bowed, in an empty stand, his girlfriend extending a consolatory arm around his shoulders. It also works the other way around: a weeping female fan, her quivering boyfriend trying to stay strong for her. Extra points for the director if either is attractive. I should like to think we are not too far away from the Brokeback version of this scene, a civil ceremony if you like: two men lovingly consoling each other \u2013 not in an alcohol-fuelled-I-bloody-love-you-mate way \u2013 on relegation day. That could be a giant step towards ridding our national sport of homophobia. In fairness, MOTD struggled to find anything particularly interesting for us to look at on Saturday. Basement battles tend to be nervy and artless, but even the matches with less at stake, like Sunderland\u2011Liverpool and Aston Villa\u2011Fulham, were pretty desperate. The Real Betis\u2011Real Madrid match on Sky on Saturday, and even more so Manchester United's defeat against Athletic Bilbao on Thursday, left you wondering whether the Premier League is always as advertised. An allied question this week was whether the Argentinian Lionel Messi would have flourished quite as spectacularly if his professional career had started in the Premier League rather than La Liga. A huge slice of scheduling luck saw a documentary about Messi going out on ITV4 \u2013 on the same night as the little magician scored five goals in the Champions League. A well-researched programme followed Messi from child prodigy in Argentina, through his apprenticeship, to his enthronement as greatest player of all time, according to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, and all\u2011round nice guy, according to everybody else. Had a talent like Messi's emerged in Britain, it would undoubtedly have been recognised, but only alongside the caveat that he was too small and slight to make it all the way. His ball-hogging would have probably raised eyebrows too. \"He always had the ball, he never passed,\" said Carles Rexach, Barcelona's technical director, who signed a 15-year-old Messi despite others' doubts. So impressed was Rexach that, to stop Messi and the player's father from flying back to Argentina, and in the absence of a handy contract, Rexach got the signature on a napkin. There was, of course, some remarkable footage of Messi, and tributes not only from Wenger, but from Sir Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo, Eric Abidal, Trevor Francis and others. Nobody actually said it, but here was a man who could put a knot in the tightest shorts \u2013 whatever that means."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
