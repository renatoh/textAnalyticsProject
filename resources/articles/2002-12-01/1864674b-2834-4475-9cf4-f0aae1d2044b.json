A dedicated website, which goes live next month to showcase them, will create a platform for young people to express what they care about. Known as Project Zool, the initiative has involved Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE) commissioning five documentary film profiles of ordinary people with extraordinary passions. These will be seen on the Zool website. Other young people will be invited to submit short films about themselves and the best 15 will then be added to the site in the coming months. Eventually SCEE hopes to use the films within an exhibition. It has already done a deal to have the first five played during the break at concerts given by Brit Awards favourite The Streets, and may soon distribute them in indie cinemas, or sell them on to a broadcaster. PlayStation is already a regular sponsor of grassroots sports and other activities, such as skateboarding and dragster racing. But creating content has become an increasingly important activity for the brand, says SCEE sponsorship and events manager Carl Christopher. \"To evolve as a brand you have to create content and instigate it. There's little point in merely reflecting what's going on around you. The difference is involvement. And we want to find new, different and interesting ways of getting people involved with the PlayStation brand.\" Brand-funded content is a strategy already established by BMW. Its bmw.films.com initiative has so far produced nine short films, each directed by leading Hollywood talent and accessible only via the internet. No films contain overt branding; each is united by the appearance of the actor Clive Owen and a BMW car. BMW estimates more than 13 million people have seen the first five films since their launch last year, generating a database of more than 2.4m email contacts. Earlier this year PlayStation got involved with the second series of Channel 4's youth lifestyle show Passengers which it co-funded. It also brought out the first three editions of a fanzine called Pilchard Teeth (an anagram of PlayStation's advertising strapline: \"the third place\"). Pilchard Teeth now sponsors the Clerkenwell Literary Festival. \"It's all about developing new forms of communication that go far and beyond the usual marketing routes,\" says Christopher. Yet PlayStation's past activities have had one fundamental weakness: lack of interactivity. Zool is an attempt to remedy this. Interaction and participation, after all, are what PlayStation products are all about. At one level the \"real lives\" theme is a natural extension of PlayStation's \"third place\" line. \"The third place is all about how people create their own entertainment, and how people define themselves,\" Christopher explains. \"We're featuring people who are pushing the boundaries - doing things away from the mainstream. It's not about highlighting the weird or bizarre. This isn't a freakshow - something to laugh at. But it is a platform to channel emotions and to bring out what young people today are really passionate about, and highlight this in a positive, celebratory way.\" \"This is a redefinition of 'reality TV',\" says Sacha Teulon, co-founder of youth content provider Hotbed which produced Zool's first five films. \"We set out not to reduce youth culture to the stereotypical snapshot you see throughout established media. We wanted to present the raw, rough, vibrant reality of what it is and what we saw.\" Her co-founder Kirsty Robinson adds, \"So-called reality TV offers such a polished, insular perspective on reality. This is much more honest, and wears its heart on its sleeve.\" The subjects selected for the first five films were chosen specifically because they did not fit into the London-Manchester-Leeds youth culture axis that dominates conventional media. Also featured is a traveller who regularly takes part in illegal horse races along Britain's motorways, and a British breakdancer who makes it into a leading US breakdancing crew. \"We looked for people who were distinctive and true to themselves rather than wannabes eager to bask in fame and glory,\" says Teulon. \"We used the old-fashioned, fly-on-thewall approach, and participants had editorial control. It's all about people defining themselves on their own terms.\" \"It's the opposite to how Popstars or Big Brother is run,\" Robinson says. \"Yes, I suppose there is an opportunity to become famous, but being totally genuine will make someone of real interest.\" In return for baring their passions on air, those featured will gain access to a platform likely to raise their profile, create contacts with like-minded enthusiasts and even secure sponsorship or other commercial backing for their chosen activity. But isn't all this taking the venture rather too close to the star-making obsession already gripping TV executive boardrooms? Christopher thinks not. \"We are not setting out to be responsible for making people famous,\" he insists. \"We have - and must be seen to have - more integrity. This isn't about money or fame. This is absolutely not about being manufactured, it's about being real.\" And as such PlayStation's involvement as commissioner, funder and executive producer is clearly signalled throughout. \"It's not advertising. These are genuine films: and people who have seen them so far are intrigued,\" Christopher adds. \"But we're not going to shy away from the fact that PlayStation is the content provider. Why should we? It's about providing the material, saying this is what it is - take it or leave it.\" People accept now that content has to come from a commercial entity, he adds: \"So long as we're not cheating, and content isn't compromised by any overt commercial message and, of course, it's entertaining - that's what really counts.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
