Join me at 7.05pm for, weather permitting, liev coverage of the final session, which the Windies will resume on 127 for 4. 6.40pm: rain stops play Sarwan adds three to the Windies tally before the rain returns and the players leave the field. How frustrating: England look like taking a wicket with every ball. \"Harmison bowled undeniably superbly in the second innings of Jamaica,\" writes James Bridgeman, \"and the Windies looked genuinely frightened of him. Is the same happening now, or are they chucking their wickets away like fools/England batsmen of the early 90s?\" They look frightened, James. Smith was lucky to get through that last over. 33rd over: West Indies 124-4 (Sarwan 10, Smith 10) Harmison whistles a couple past Smith's nose and the umpires consult briefly about the light. But they're happy with things for the time being. Harmison is in the groove once more and Smith is lucky to get away with a loose drive that flies just over the head of gully and away for four. Vaughan responds by posting seven slips. Superb stuff from Harmison. \"Was Boycott ever dismissed by anyone with a double-barrelled surname?\" muses Luke Shiach. Andy? You still there? 32nd over: West Indies 120-4 (Sarwan 10, Smith 6) Smith shows what he's capable of with an exquisitely timed flick for four through square-leg as Jones, searching for the yorker, strays onto his pads. Ever the card, umpire Billy Bowden pretends he was ready for the catch. Rain is in the air again. \"Thatt picture of Steve Harmison looks like he's seen something really unpleasant on the streets below and is recoiling in disgust,\" points out Olly Skinner. \"Doesn't Becca from Hollyoaks play for England or something? She usually scrubs up well for photos. Just a thought.\" 31st over: West Indies 115-4 (Sarwan 10, Smith 1) Harmison is getting close to 90mph here and is bowling as well as he did just before lunch. Smith pushes a single to cover and Sarwan plays out the rest of the over without looking particularly convincing. \"I stumped Andy Lyman,\" cries Rory McCafferty. \"He answered four, but the correct answer is Boycott was out six times in nervous nineties.\" If that helps Andy win Mastermind, Rory, then I think we've done our job. 30th over: West Indies 114-4 (Sarwan 10, Smith 0) The Windies have now lost 4 for 13 either side of lunch. It's a mini-Jamaica. The new batsman is Dwayne Smith, who earlier this year crashed a century off just 93 balls on his Test debut in South Africa. He can play but he gives the bowlers a chance. WICKET! Chanderpaul c Read b Jones 2 (113-4) Chanderpaul nibbles at Jones, who worked hard for that wicket. He had pushed him onto the back foot with a series of bouncers, then gave him the tempter outside off. Chanderpaul obliged, Read did the rest and England are cock-a-hoop. \"How do you decide if an e-mail is witty enough for inclusion?\" asks Adam Blackwell-Blackwell-Blackwell. \"Are there any objective criteria, or is it all instinct?\" Oh, it's pure instinct, Adam. When I see a triple-barrelled monicker such as your own, I just know I have to use it. 29th over: West Indies 113-3 (Sarwan 10, Chanderpaul 2) Harmison is over the wicket to Chanderpaul, with three slips and two gullies lying in wait. He finds the outside edge, but the ball lands a foot in front of Flintoff at second slip. Chanderpaul prevents a maiden from nudging a the last ball of the over to long leg for a single. \"On second thoughts,\" adds Ian Spencer, \"you do get the runs, but more slowly.\" 28th over: West Indies 112-3 (Sarwan 10, Chanderpaul 1) Simon Jones continues from the evocatively named Media Centre End and he's clearly working on a plan to get Sarwan lbw. But that was one was too straight and Sarwan moves into double-figures with a single to backward square. The skies are still grey, so this should in theory be a decent time to bowl. Chanderpaul gets off the mark with an unconvincing shovel to leg gully for a single. \"Can we do the Johnners joke?\" asks Ian Spencer. \"Boycott goat curry is just like other curries but you don't get the runs.\" 27th over: West Indies 110-3 (Sarwan 9, Chanderpaul 0) Harmison just had one ball of that over to complete and Chanderpaul watches it pass by outside off-stump. That was a double-wicket maiden spread over more than two hours. 6.05pm Right, just five minutes to go before the restart. If Harmison can wangle another wicket quickly, England really will be in business, especially given the length of the West Indian tail. Andi Thomas has a metaphysical Boycs poser. \"If Geoff performs a forward defensive in the woods and there's no-one there to see it, is it still boring?\" I like it. 6pm Andy Lyman is back - with the answers to the Boycs questions! \"In order of appearance,\" he begins. \"Tom Barton-Barton - Graham Roope-Roope. Can you imagine what the reaction of the faithful would have been if he hadn't jumped when he did? \"To Allen Knox - ITB usually says that he did this foul deed, but Geoff reckons not. According to his autobiography, anyway. \"James Bridgeman - Yes, I can spell career. Despite all evidence to the contrary. Anyway, It's the Guardian website, for Boyc's sake! \"Stephen Musgrave - I think he termed the meetings to arrange the rebel tour 'playing chess'. \"Louise Wright - because he's a legend. \"Rory McCafferty - four times, I think. Good question, and one that has a good chance of coming up. I'll check when I get home. Thanks. \"Tom Bowtell - One of my school mates in the mid-70's was genuinely amazed to find the word 'boycott' did not derive from Lord Geoffrey. Still, grammar school education, eh?\" How about that? 5.55pm While we wait for play to resume, here's Craig Finbow, who clearly hasn't had a good day. \"You're earning your money?\" he laughs dismissively. \"You type one sentence and then copy and paste an \"hilarious\" anecdote from some sterling fellow just before he nips off down the pub? Congrats Larry - you keep the wheels of the economy turning. And you had a day and a half off last weekend thanks to Mr Harmison!\" Rumbled. 5.50pm The rain has stopped. And the covers are off. Play will restart at 6.10pm GMT. Do hang around and keep me company. Please? \"A philosophical one,\" writes Tom Bowtell. \"How many sixes did Geoffrey Boycott NOT hit during his Test career?\" 5.45pm For those of you who have just joined us (and I'm sure you are many), here's what's happened so far. West Indies won the toss, batted, and raced to 100 for 0 about 15 minutes to go before lunch. Then Steve Harmison returned to the attack to take 3 for 1 in eight balls, including Brian Lara for a duck, to leave the Windies reeling at 110 for 3 at lunch. Then it started raining, and it hasn't stopped. Which is why we're talking about Geoff Boycott and Trinidadian cuisine. Here's John Rudlin. \"If you want to avoid tinned curry powder, take the road from Port-of-Spain down towards the pitch lake,\" he advises. \"On a sunny day (not today, obviously) you'll find roadside vendors of home made killer-driller pickles which you can add to any old goat to give a truly authentic Trini flavour.\" 5.35pm It's at times like this that I really earn my money. Still raining, needless to say. I'm not sure all of you are taking the Boycs Mastermind Challenge very seriously. Here's Tom Bowtell: \"How many times were puns along the lines of 'Geoff boycotts Test matches' used in newspaper headlines during his self-imposed exile in the 1970s?\" 5.30pm Good grief, there are some real anoraks among you. \"Just doing my maths, and if I am not wrong,\" calculates Graham Sharp. \"Harmison for the series has 102-12 with an average of 8.5. Pretty impressive.\" 5.25pm The Boycs questions are pouring in now, which could pave the way for a cheap weather metaphor, but I won't insult you. \"How many times was Boycott out in the nervous nineties?\" asks Rory McCafferty. If Andy Lyman doesn't get back to me, I'll post all the answers later. You can be sure of that. 5.20pm I suppose with England 1-0 up in the series, we should be cheering on the elements, but England must be itching to get out there again and let Harmison loose. He now has 12 wickets in the series in less than three innings. Here's Louise Wright with another Boycs question. \"How come so many women have found Geoff sufficiently attractive to do the naughty with?\" she asks, incredulously. 5.15pm No sign of the rain stopping. Groan. Another Boycs question for Andy Lyman, who has either been completely stumped by the last one, or just left work and gone home. \"On the India tour of 1981-82,\" writes Stephen Musgrave, \"Boycs recruited players for the rebel SA tour to take place the following year. How did he keep this secret from the tour's management?\" 5.06pm More rain. That 30% chance I spoke of before has proved optimistic. STOP RAINING! Well, it's worth a try. James Bridgeman has spotted a typo and, boy, is he running with it! \"Can Andy Lyman let us know how much caring Boycs' Test carer did in their career,\" he japes. \"And how long the carer's career lasted? And also what a Test carer is?\" Nothing like flogging a dead horse, eh, James. 5.02pm No sign of the rain abating here in Trinidad. I'm not sure why I used the word \"here\", when I'm actually stuck in Farringdon, trying not to listen to the banter of my colleagues. Allan Knox has made Andy Lyman's life easy by providing a question to which the answer is Geoff Boycott. It's a generous one, Allan, but I'm not sure John Humphreys will be quite so obliging. \"Who,\" asks Allan, \"was the last captain of England to be deliberately run out by his team-mates?\" 4.56pm Ah. It's started to rain again, really quite heavily. Shame. We have a Boycs question to exercise Andy Lyman's master-mind. It comes from Tom Barton-Barton, who rightly guessed that making his name double-barrelled increased his chances of getting a mention. \"Who was at the crease with Boycs when he scored his 100th first class hundred (and jumped over the ball to see Geoffrey's beautifully-timed on-drive speed towards the rope)?\" Any ideas, Andy? 4.52pm The rain has stopped, and the umpires are out, but there's no immediate prospect of play and the skies are still clouded in grey. \"Home Office Statistics show that should you have a double-barrelled surname, you're more susceptible to undertake in \"dogging\" as a pastime,\" writes Michael Garvey, who seems to know what he's talking about. 4.48pm I hate to say it, but for the third time in the series, the rain has come at the right time for the Windies. They would still have been shellshocked had they resumed at 4.45pm as planned. Instead, they get to regroup in the dressing-room. \"The Mango Rooms right by Camden Town tube does an excellent Goat Curry,\" reports Dominic Smith. \"I challenge Ross McEwan to find it anything other than tender and subtly-spiced.\" 4.42pm The answer is, we won't know for a while - because it's raining over the Queen's Park Oval. In the meantime, here's Andy Lyman. \"I'm recording a heat of Mastermind in Manchester on Sunday,\" he writes casually. \"I'm taking the Test Carer of Lord Boycott of Fitzwilliam as a specialist subject - any hints or tips will be greatfully appreciated?\" Might I suggest the readers write in with their Boycs questions in an attempt to warm Andy up before his date with destiny? 4.40pm How many surprises has this series got in store for us. The Windies were cruising at 100-0 when Steve Harmison turned the game on its head with a spell of 3 for 1 from eight balls, including Brian Lara, on his home ground, for a duck. Harmison has got one ball left in his eighth over - can he make it three wickets in the over?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
