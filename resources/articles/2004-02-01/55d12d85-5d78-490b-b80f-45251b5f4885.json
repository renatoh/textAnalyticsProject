Twenty suspected football hooligans were detained by police at airports across the country before flying out for England's friendly international match in Portugal last night, leaving most fans to enjoy Portuguese hospitality in the centre of Faro. Ten of those arrested were found to be the subject of banning orders preventing them from watching football matches, while the others were allowed to fly out after being served a notice under section 21a of the Football Disorder Act. More than 5,000 England fans were estimated to be making their way to the Algarve for the match in Faro, the first away game for a year in which the Football Association has accepted a ticket allocation. Around 2,000 known hooligans have been forced to hand over their passports to British police over the last five days and another 500 are expected to be made the subject of banning orders before the European Championship in Port- ugal this summer, when there could be 250,000 British holidaymakers and football fans in the country. That total of banning orders will be far higher than at Euro 2000 in Belgium and Holland. \"Our commitment to the Portuguese is that those individuals will not travel,\" Swift said. \"Never has there been more effort put into working with fans or more effort to get UK policing sorted out,\" he added. \"There have never been better relationships between local police [in Portugal], the UK police and the British government. \"All the basics that you could hope to have in position are as good as they have been in the past, and better.\" Almost inevitably there will be problems, given the past history of England football hooliganism, but Swift said he was confident that the Portuguese police would be capable of dealing with trouble. \"Nobody can guarantee the outcome, especially as often these incidents are single flashpoints,\" said Swift. He added that England's group game against Switzerland, to be played at the 30,000-seat stadium in Coimbra, gave most cause for concern. \"It's simply the fact that it's a small stadium,\" he said. \"Twice as many people can get into the other games at Lisbon and Porto. You've got an awful lot of people wanting tickets with nowhere to go. It's also difficult to get there in transport terms. Those sort of issues provide extra complications.\" Portugal's cabinet yesterday backed the police preparations by agreeing to measures, which still need government approval, aimed at preventing violence at Euro 2004. The organisers expect to have to deal with 500,000 fans and about 60,000 police and emergency workers will be mobilised. The measures include temporary rules on expulsion of foreigners, electronic surveillance, summary judgment and barring people from venues. Ministers also made it a crime to tout tickets, throw objects on to pitches, take alcohol into venues and cause disturbance while travelling. Yesterday hundreds of English fans mingled peacefully with locals, sat in the sun drinking beer and bought souvenirs. Some 2,000 had flown in for the match. Local police kept a low profile at Faro international airport as eight early-morning flights arrived from various English cities. The fans, some wearing white England shirts, moved quietly through the arrivals lounge. They were handed information leaflets but the flowers promised by the local tourism authority failed to put in an appearance. Many supporters boarded buses which were specially chartered to take them directly to a public park in the city centre, where the local authorities had organised day-long entertainment, including restaurants, bars and live music, and had erected a giant video screen. \"It's a big surprise,\" said Nuno Guedes, the proprietor of one of the stalls serving food. \"Everyone's calm, everyone's friends. We had expected problems.\" A 31-year-old regular England fan from Nottingham, who gave his name only as John, sat outside a bar drinking beer with three friends. \"This is the nicest atmosphere we've ever encountered,\" he said. Pairs of policemen, some with dogs and some on bicycles, mingled with the crowd. The stalls flew England flags and a large banner read: \"The city of Faro welcomes English supporters.\" However, riot police and cavalry were said to be on hand in case of trouble but were being kept out of sight, and police at the stadium were told to turn away fans thought to have been drinking excessively and to frisk all those entering."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
