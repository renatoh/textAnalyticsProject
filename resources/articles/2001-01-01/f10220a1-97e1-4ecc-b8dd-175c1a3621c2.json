In my mind's eye, the scene I watched him rehearse from Kevin Elyot's new play Mouth to Mouth would not let me go. Words and gestures kept coming back. I teased at them; they teased back. The scene seemed a riddle with many possible answers. It is the nearest I will ever come to understanding how consuming a director's work must be. Ian Rickson took over as artistic director of the Royal Court from Stephen Daldry in 1998. He presided over the last stages of the Court's \u00a329 million revamp, and his production of Conor McPherson's Dublin Carol opened the new theatre in March 2000. His zestful treatment of Jez Butterworth's 1950s gangster play Mojo (1995) launched him; his production of Conor McPherson's The Weir made his name. Rickson is tall and boyish (at 37) with toffee-brown eyes, a hooked nose and severely short hair. He is a little camp, though not gay. (He lives with theatre director Polly Teale and has a teenage son, Jack, by a previous partner). He is beautifully turned out on the afternoon we meet, in cream trousers and cardi gan and black leather slippers. His elegant, minimal appearance is like the quality of his work: no excrescences or gimmicks. In this, he is part of Royal Court tradition. When I ask him if he thinks Stephen Daldry a 'hard act to follow', he answers that Daldry is 'an inspiring person', but the question is not one he asks himself. He likens the Court's work to a 'narrative' of which he is a part. He acknowledges a stylistic link with the 1950s English Stage company who aimed to 'create actor-led, uncluttered stagecraft.' He says there is a 'collegiate' feeling between himself, Daldry, Max Stafford Clark, Peter Gill, Jocelyn Herbert and others who have worked at the Court. It was Stafford Clark who gave Rickson his first break, making him a director for the Young People's Theatre at the Court. Rickson is laid back and eager at the same time, a combination that is all his own. He is impossible not to like, even though his sweetness sometimes seems precious. But he is surprisingly hard to interview: there is a great deal that needs to be 'off the record' and about the record itself, he is visibly concerned. He does not want to sound pompous, pretentious, 'tight-arsed', evangelical. He need not worry so much. The only tricky thing about him is the extent to which he hopes to manage his own image. I put it to him that the flipside of his niceness is that he minds terribly what other people think. He looks a little taken aback (hurt even?) but agrees: 'Yes, true.' He reflects that sensitivity matters, it is important to care about work but maintains such feelings 'shouldn't be in the [rehearsal] room. Actors should never have to pick up on a director's insecurity - just as children do not want to know when their parents are unhappy.' Rickson was born in Chaldon, south- east London. His father was an agency sports reporter, his mother an usherette at the Ambassadors theatre. He read English at Essex where he also acted a great deal. I first met him in 1988 when he entered a Young Directors competition at the Battersea Arts Centre. He did not win. I no longer remember who did but have never forgotten Ian. He was clad in black like a trainee Hamlet, and something about him blazed. He was emphatic about what he wanted to do: to direct contemporary work. And now his wish has more than come true: the Royal Court is the largest commissioning theatre in the world. But why this absolute commitment to new writing? (I remember once commenting that Rickson's zeal was enough to make one feel one should take umbrage on behalf of all old or dead playwrights): 'It is the most interesting thing to work with playwrights on new plays because there is no context, no Coles notes, no previous perfor mances. We are hurtled into the present together... there is an exhilaration about this.' He did not need to tell me. I had seen it in practice. Between 2pm and 5.45pm in a snazzy rehearsal room opposite the Young Vic, I watched Rickson direct Lindsay Duncan, Michael Maloney and Barnaby Kay. My first impression was that Rickson resembled a gentle teacher (all good teachers get students to think for themselves). 'The best directors are good listeners,' Rickson remarked later. He asked actors questions about how their characters felt. 'What is the rhythm of that?' he might wonder, about a particular gesture. Rhythm is 'really important' to him. To direct well, you must have a 'good ear'. I was impressed by his careful approach to time and by the way he scored speech, as if it were music. Actors will be the first to tell you that their work is emotionally 'draining.' But I felt wrung out just watching Lindsay Duncan. Over and over, she found her way into the grief of the last scene in which she mourns the death of a son. She has a gift for elegy: a voice from elsewhere: soft, starved. Ian listened with total attention to everything she had to say about her part. When I read Kevin Elyot's Mouth to Mouth (Elyot is most famous for his My Night with Reg , though Rickson has also directed the tender, introverted The Day I Stood Still for the National) I found it a slender, depressed piece: all bones and no flesh. Ian regards it as 'beautifully written and formally precise' and thinks 'the sensibility which links sex and death feels very contemporary'. I tell him I was moved in rehearsal. Perhaps I had failed to mind the gap between page and stage. Rickson wishes he could have longer rehearsal periods. How much does administration interfere with his creative work? 'Attitude is all. If you feel the administration is cumbersome and beleaguering then everything becomes difficult. You have to think of going to meet some rich donor who might support the theatre as a creative act' Rickson intervenes more in the later stages of rehearsal. I liked the way that, at every chance, he seemed keen to extend the humanity of the play. 'I think you go to the theatre to try and understand what it is to be human', he said later. He is anything but a nihilist. There was a wonderful moment in which he suggested 'as an exercise' that Lindsay Duncan and Barnaby Kay tango - an allusion to their shared past. The exercise worked and was incorporated into the piece. 'As an exercise,' Rickson joked, is a 'trick' to get actors to try something out fearlessly. Watching, it seemed like magical sleight of hand. Rickson tells actors their gestures need to be 'earned'. Every line of the play is considered and given a context. The cast is encouraged to bring in anything that might help with the work, as a bird might fetch twigs for a nest. (I was reminded of a good primary school teacher again.) The cast was also sent on outings. Michael Maloney went to eat at the Ivy - as his character does in the play. Lindsay Duncan drew the short straw and went to Balham to identify the house in which her character might have lived. Kevin Elyot sat in on rehearsals and offered his comments and read aloud a marvellous piece, by A.C. Grayling, about death: 'The presence of those who lived can never be removed from the lives of those who cared about them, which gives them a kind of immortality.' What advice would Ian give to someone wanting to be a director? 'You need stubborn persistence' and 'an absolute fascination in people, so that you are sustained by curiosity'. I am sure it would be lovely to be directed by Rickson. He is unthreatening, hopeful, illuminating. In fact, he is top of the class. \u0095 Mouth to Mouth opens at the Royal Court on 6 February"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
