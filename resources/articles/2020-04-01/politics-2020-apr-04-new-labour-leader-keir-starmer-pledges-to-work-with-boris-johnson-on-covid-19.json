In a phone call with the prime minister after being elected Labour leader, Starmer offered to work constructively with the prime minister and not provide \u201copposition for opposition\u2019s sake\u201d. However, with pandemic experts warning this weekend about the difficult route out of the lockdown, Starmer said he would \u201ccall out\u201d the government over failings in its strategy. Starmer has agreed to meet the prime minister this week. Johnson remained in self-isolation on Saturday with a temperature after he contracted the virus. The pledge between the party leaders came as: \u2022 Numbers of daily new cases of Covid-19 dropped from 4,450 on Friday to a total of 3,735, leading to hopes that the disease\u2019s spread could be levelling off. Total numbers of UK cases of the disease now stand at 41,903. An additional 708 people died. \u2022 It emerged that 212 patients in the Midlands have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the last 24 hours \u2013 more than London, which has been hit hardest so far, which had 127 deaths. \u2022 There were signs of a slight drop in public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic. An Opinium poll for the Observer found that approval of the government\u2019s handling dropped from a net approval of +42% last week to +23% this week. \u2022 Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, warned that there was evidence that the young were less compliant with social distancing orders, as he pleaded with the public to show \u201cself-restraint\u201d and follow the lockdown measures. \u2022 It was announced that the Queen will praise the nation for its \u201cself-discipline\u201d and \u201cresolve\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic in a rare televised address broadcast on Sunday. The Cambridge University statistician, Sir David Speigelhalter, said the drop in the number of new cases gave grounds for optimism. \u201cI am relieved. We should be seeing a flattening of the upward curve of new cases and these figures are entirely compatible with such a trend. It looks like we are beginning to see a levelling off of the disease\u2019s spread,\u201d he said. But as ministers plead with the public to stay home, there are concerns in Whitehall over maintaining the lockdown in the weeks ahead. One source said: \u201cIf numbers turn, front pages saying we\u2019re winning the war, that will be tough. Broadly at the moment, no one is going outside. If that changes, it could change quickly.\u201d There was also a warning from a leading pandemic expert that failings \u201cranging from lack of preparedness to complacency\u201d meant that there was now no alternative to building immunity in the population, either through gradual infection or vaccination \u2013 which could be more than a year away. Francois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology and the director of the University College London genetics institute, said: \u201cI personally, cannot see any viable alternative to ensuring immunity builds up in the population, through infection or vaccination. What is critical is to minimise hospital overload, to ensure mortality is kept as low as possible. There was a window of opportunity earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, where it could have been controlled. We missed it, for various reasons, ranging from lack of preparedness to complacency. We should analyse our failings in the future, but now is not the time for blame.\u201d A No 10 spokesperson responded: \u201cAs set out by the prime minister, we are working to a scientifically-led, step-by-step action plan \u2013 taking the right measures at the right time.\u201d However, there is now an open debate in Whitehall and the scientific community about the best route out of the lockdown measures, which government advisers have suggested may need to be in place until the end of May. Professor Martin Hibberd, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, pointed to successful strategies employed in other countries. These have involved very large-scale testing and as much contact tracing as possible, to identify people with the virus. \u201cThis strategy was difficult to achieve at the beginning of the outbreak, because of logistic problems in testing at such a large scale and our lack of experience at large scale contact tracing,\u201d Hibberd added. \u201cHowever, we should now be able to overcome these problems.\u201d Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University highlighted three key strategies for dealing with the epidemic. \u201cOnce lockdown has driven down the virus to low enough levels in the community we can go back to chasing down individual cases. At the same time we build more ICU capacity in the NHS so we can relax the lockdown without the health service being overwhelmed. And thirdly, we place new emphasis in shielding the vulnerable.\u201d By contrast, John Edmunds, also of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argued that the only way to proceed was to continue with the lockdown policy for many months. \u201cTesting on its own will not stop this epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want the NHS to cope then you will have to take extreme measures for a long time. There is no way out. We will have social distance for many months or hospitals will be overwhelmed. Mass testing, mass contact tracing and more technology are fine, but what we really need is a vaccine.\u201d Starmer used his acceptance address to vow that the country could not go \u201cback to business as usual\u201d once the pandemic was under control. \u201cThis virus has exposed the fragility of our society. It\u2019s lifted a curtain. Too many will have given too much. Some of us will have lost too much. We know in our hearts, things are going to have to change,\u201d he said. Yesterday, Carrie Symonds, the prime minister\u2019s pregnant partner, revealed she had spent a week in bed with the main symptoms of Covid-19, but said she was \u201con the mend\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 April 2020 to correct a quote from Sir David Spiegelhalter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
