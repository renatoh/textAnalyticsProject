Murdoch, 84, who is currently chairman and CEO of the company, will become executive co-chairman alongside his eldest son Lachlan. The management changes, which had been expected, were approved by the company\u2019s board in New York on Tuesday. \u201cIt has always been our priority to ensure stable, long-term leadership for the company, and these appointments achieve that goal,\u201d Rupert Murdoch said in a press release. \u201cLachlan and James are each talented and accomplished executives and together, we, as shareholders and partners, will strive to take our company to new levels of growth and opportunity at a time of dynamic change in our industry.\u201d In a joint statement, Lachlan, 43, and James, 42, said: \u201cWe are both humbled by the opportunity to lead, with our father and the talented team of executives at 21st Century Fox, this extraordinary company.\u201d The brothers have long been battling to take over the reins of the company from their father, with Lachlan being thought of as frontrunner after James was mired in the phone-hacking scandal as chief executive of Murdoch\u2019s UK newspaper group before he left to join Fox in New York in 2011. He is currently co-chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox, which spans Fox News, X-Men film studio 20th Century Fox, and a joint venture TV production group that is behind shows including MasterChef, Big Brother and American Idol. It also owns 40% of the UK\u2019s Sky television. The 21st Century Fox entertainment business was split from Murdoch\u2019s publishing empire News Corp \u2013 home to the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times in the UK and the Wall Street Journal in the US \u2013 two years ago. Former editor of the Times Robert Thomson became chief executive of News Corp, while Rupert assumed the role of executive chairman. The Murdoch family controls almost 40% of the company\u2019s voting shares, while owning just 12%. Chase Carey, a longstanding lieutenant of Rupert Murdoch who has been deputy chairman, president and chief operating officer since 2009, will become executive vice-chairman until the end of June 2016. \u201cI can\u2019t thank Chase Carey enough for his friendship, counsel and leadership over the past decades,\u201d Rupert Murdoch said. \u201cHe will be actively engaged in supporting Lachlan and James as they step in to their new roles.\u201d Chase Carey said: \u201cI am grateful to Rupert for giving me the opportunity of a lifetime and truly believe there isn\u2019t a Company out there that\u2019s more exciting, with more growth potential, than 21st Century Fox. I look forward to continuing to work with Rupert to support Lachlan and James in their new positions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
