Asked again about his recent observation that it was unfair for Roger Federer to be moved above him in the seedings to No 2 behind the defending champion, Novak Djokovic, because of Wimbledon\u2019s emphasis on grasscourt results, Nadal \u2013 who almost beat the Serb to reach the final a year ago \u2013 said tetchily: \u201cI came here to play tennis.\u201d He added: \u201cFor me the goal is the same always: it doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m second or third. [But tennis] is not only about grass. The season is not only on grass. All the players work so hard to be where they are, then arrive here, they see [they might be] in a tougher draw because of that. \u201cIf I believe that is fair or not, that\u2019s another story. I personally believe [it] is not. But I respect the tournament so much, the history of this event. I understand they see the sport from another perspective. They want to do it by their own rules.\u201d After placating his hosts Nadal \u2013 who plays his first match against Japan\u2019s Yuichi Sugita on Tuesday - shifted some of the blame on to the ATP, for allowing Wimbledon to do what they want with the seedings. \u201cWe give two thousand points to this event. We are supposed to have something to say about [these] Wimbledon rules when we are giving them the maximum points possible in one event.\u201d As it happens, Nadal is on course to meet Federer in the semi-finals, the winner probably facing Djokovic in the final on Sunday week \u2013 if the natural order of things is not disturbed. Federer, obviously, loves these lawns, having won eight titles, and disputed the recent view that they are playing more like hard courts. \u201cMaybe for some, they feel it\u2019s not far from hard,\u201d said the 37-year-old Swiss, who opens against the South African Lloyd Harris on Tuesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s still quite different. The movement requires different talents. I believe also the way the ball bounces, the way it takes the spins or not, is quite a change still. Every year they get better and better, so it\u2019s easier to play from the baseline \u2013 especially I would say the first week. [But] it\u2019s still a huge change to hard courts.\u201d And playing it from the baseline much of the time will be Djokovic, the defending champion and world No 1, who plays Philipp Kohlschreiber on Monday. He revealed he was 17 the first time he played on grass \u2013 in trying to qualify for Wimbledon \u2013 but the surface holds no fears for the champion, who is seeking to move alongside Bj\u00f6rn Borg with five titles. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a baseline player but grass is the quickest surface in sport and unique. It makes you come in more, try to use short balls and slices and chip returns. You need more variety in your game. Everything happens very quickly. This surface requires more hours spent on the court training than any other, to get used to it. Probably the most radical change is coming from clay to grass. But over the years I guess you get used to it.\u201d Ever the historian, he added: \u201cWe have only a month a year, maybe five weeks, when we play on grass. It is the most historic surface and the most traditional. Of course this tournament is sacred. That\u2019s why you feel special and different than playing on any other surface on the Tour.\u201d One day, surely, F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime will make history here but, even if the Canadian teenager is being ushered towards the prize with unseemly haste, he appreciates the hunger for change, while profoundly disagreeing with the notion that the Big Three are there for the taking. Midway through a phenomenal summer, A-A \u2013 as he is known by those still struggling to pronounce his double-barrelled name \u2013 arrives in the main draw for the first time and his realistic hopes are to make the second week. The 19th seed starts his campaign against his compatriot Vasek Pospisil on Monday, in the same group of 16 as Djokovic. He will probably have to beat the former quarter-finalist Grigor Dimitrov, the 16th seed Ga\u00ebl Monfils and the 21st seed David Goffin to get anywhere near the Serb, so his caution is justified. \u201cThey are not going anywhere just yet,\u201d Auger-Aliassime said of Djokovic, Nadal and Federer. If they played on green cheese, these three would probably still be the main contenders for the Championship. None of which will matter a lot once the draw settles down, disturbed briefly when Borna Coric withdrew with an abdominal injury, giving a place to the lucky loser Brayden Schnur."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
