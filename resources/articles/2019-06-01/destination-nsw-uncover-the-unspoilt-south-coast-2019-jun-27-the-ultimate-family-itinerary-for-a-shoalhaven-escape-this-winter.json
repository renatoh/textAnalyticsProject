Luckily, this coast is also home to a thriving culinary culture, rich in quality produce, wine and coffee shops. From bushwalks, surfing, and scouring the local markets, to wineries, wood-fired pizza and doughnut vans, it\u2019s all just a few hours from Sydney and Canberra. Day 1 Il Locale Gelato, Berry 9am Drive out of Sydney for a scenic trip down the coastal strip to Berry. 12pm Once you hit Berry, make time for lunch at Il Locale, a cafe and gelateria run by Josie and Damian Jennings. The menu includes staples such as a hearty egg and bacon roll and specials that change almost daily. \u201cWe have a very local clientele,\u201d Josie says. \u201cRegulars will come in and request something and the next day it\u2019s on the menu for them - whatever people feel like eating, bowls of soup or burgers.\u201d Il Locale serves gelato by the Kiama dairy, the Pines, and coffee by Coffee Culture in Bowral. \u201cWe do about 60 to 70kg of coffee a week, which is quite a lot for a small country town,\u201d Josie says. Josie and Damian also own Quattro Pizzeria in Berry, open Thursday to Monday nights. While you\u2019re in town, pick up a loaf of the famed sourdough from Milkwood Bakery. 1pm On the way south, stop for groceries at the Nowra Farmers\u2019 Market, where produce from a variety of South Coast farmers is available under one roof (think Contadino olives, Ridgehaven eggs and vegetables from Terara Farm). The deli section is impressive. If you\u2019re ready for another coffee, Josie suggests Hyper Hyper in Nowra. \u201cIt\u2019s a small corner spot with milk crates out front,\u201d she says. \u201cThey make super strong, really good coffee. It\u2019s our go-to.\u201d 2pm Josie recommends taking a scenic walk while you\u2019re in the region, so with supplies sorted, head to the Florence Head walking track. This 6.3km trail is an easy flat path that begins at the Little Forest car park near Ulladulla. Walk through soft bushland to the cliff and lookout over to iconic Pigeon House Mountain. The walk will take around 90 minutes. 3pm Check in to your accommodation at Cupitt\u2019s Cottage on Cupitt\u2019s award-winning, family-owned winery. This 100-year-old stone cottage is set among the vines, 100 metres from Cupitt\u2019s Kitchen, and five minutes\u2019 drive from Ulladulla, Milton and Mollymook Beach. While you\u2019re there, explore the walking tracks through the vineyards. 4.30pm Later in the afternoon, head to Murramarang National Park, where banksias, coastal rosemary and lomandra grow on the exposed headlands buffeted by salt sea winds. At Pebbly Beach around dusk, you\u2019ll likely find kangaroos hopping about on the sand. This is the beach kangaroo capital of Australia. 6pm When it gets dark, head back to Milton for dinner at The Guild, an Italian wine bar and restaurant. Day 2 8am Enjoy breakfast at home with supplies picked up from Berry and Nowra. Grab a coffee from Native in Ulladulla. 9am Weather permitting, head to Burrill Lake for some stand-up paddle boarding, with a rental from Coastal Paddle Surf. The inlet is calm, with shallow, scenic waters to paddle through. 10.30am Visit Milton Village Showground Markets (held on the first Saturday of every month and long weekends). Stalls sell arts and crafts, plants and herbs, woodwork, jewellery, local artworks, pottery, candles, soaps and clothing. There are food stalls too, and the local brass band often plays. 11.30am Wander over to Milton Donuts, selling Greek-style loukoumades and cinnamon doughnuts from a caravan named Thunderstruck. Try a coffee from Marrickville roaster Mongrel Joe\u2019s to pair with your sweet treats. 1pm Head back to Cupitt\u2019s Winery, Kitchen and Brewery \u2013 you couldn\u2019t find a prettier spot for lunch than this lush Shoalhaven farmland overlooking Burrill Lake. After some casual wine tasting at the cellar door, order wood-fired pizzas or cheese from the fromagerie. In June, Cupitt\u2019s has Sunday sessions with live music 12.30-3.30pm. \u201cSit out in the grass with a picnic rug on your knees, a glass of wine and feast on a cheese platter \u2013 in winter it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Josie says. Cupitt\u2019s also makes beer in its on-site brewery. It\u2019s the perfect souvenir to take home. 3pm Rug up back at the house and head out on a 40-minute drive to Huskisson for some whale or dolphin watching with Jervis Bay Wild or Dolphin Watch Cruises. The winter months are ideal for seeing whales migrating north. 6pm Time for an early dinner at the Quarters in Huskisson, a stylish eatery and bar with ribs night, oyster happy hour, and kids\u2019 meals for $5 Monday to Thursday. Day 3 Pilgrims Vegetarian Cafe 8am Settle in for breakfast at Pilgrims Vegetarian Cafe, serving healthy comfort food such as buckwheat pancakes, full breakfasts and meat-free burgers, with patties made from brown rice and lentils. 10am Have a surf lesson with former world champion Pam Burridge at her surf school at Mollymook Beach. Coaching is available for all levels of surfer, from first-timers to budding pros. Pam offers private and group lessons from adults and surf groms for kids aged 5-8 and 9-12. 1pm Pick up lunch at Hayden\u2019s Pies in Ulladulla before returning to the city.
