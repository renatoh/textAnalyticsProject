The fears of a meagre crowd seem to have been unfounded. \"We anticipate in excess of 2,000,\" said the Wycombe secretary, Keith Allen. That figure is much higher than the attendances expected in the forthcoming Women's Super League, six matches from which are due to be televised by ESPN. \"We played a Super League club [Birmingham] in the FA Cup last week and there were only a hundred spectators,\" said the Barnet secretary, John Taylor. \"And they told us they were expecting crowds only in the low hundreds for WSL games.\" Barnet will head into the final as the Premier League's bottom club after a 2-1 defeat at Millwall Lionesses. Forest, second in the table and without a weekend League fixture, fell five points behind the leaders, Sunderland, who won 1-0 against third-placed Leeds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
