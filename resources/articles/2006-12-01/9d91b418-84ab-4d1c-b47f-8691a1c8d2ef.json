He smoked up to 100 cigarettes a day, then quit in 1983, at the age of 48, using the method he would come to call \"the Easyway\" - and went on to become a multi-millionaire. According to Carr, his method entails no willpower, but something much simpler - the realisation on the part of the smoker that nicotine addiction is a type of illusion or confidence trick. \"Once they realise that cigarettes are the cause of their stress, and not its remedy,\" he would write, \"they can no more believe in their need to smoke than they can kid themselves the Earth is flat.\" Before inventing the Easyway, Carr's life was hard. The second of four children, he grew up in a poor part of Putney, west London. His father, a self-employed builder, was also a boozer and gambler - and, of course, a chain-smoker. Carr described him as self-employed not out of choice, but because nobody would employ him; he was moody and aggressive - \"not so much a person as a zombie\". One of Carr's early memories was of his father drunkenly threatening his mother. When the young Allen tried to intervene, \"he had his hands round my throat and there was murder in his eyes\". Carr, who described himself as \"a typical street urchin\" - he was sent to juvenile court for petty theft - unexpectedly passed his 11-plus exam, and found himself in the top stream at Wandsworth grammar school. He was short, ginger-haired and ordinary looking, but good at boxing. He hated the sport but persisted with it, he later said, to attract the attention of girls. Another thing he did not like was academic work. But he ploughed on grimly, and passed 6 GCEs, two with distinction. His parents told him the school did not consider him university material, but this, he found out later, was a lie. The truth was that they did not think they could afford the fees. So, aged 15, Carr started work as an office boy at the accountancy firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Company. He found it just as dull as school, if not worse. Soon he was an articled clerk, helping qualified accountants with audit work. One day, holed up in the offices of a firm in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, with an accountant named Ron Gazy, he accepted the older man's proffered cigarette. And then another, and another. Carr made a vow: he would never buy or accept cigarettes again. But he broke the vow, and by the age of 18 was a confirmed smoker. During national service in the RAF, he smoked roll-ups and became a drill instructor, proud of his glassy boots and banshee howl on the parade ground. He set up a small business, polishing other recruits' shoes for a fee. He had, he said, discovered a way of spitting on the shoes to make them shiny in double-quick time. He also discovered a way of stitching a permanent crease into his trousers so he would not have to iron them every day. There followed years of accountancy, accompanied by cigarettes smoked in ever greater numbers. Carr, a fiend for detail, worked on the books of, among others, a car security firm called Autolock, a damp-proofing company and Pedigree Dolls, the company that launched the Sindy doll. He married Ellen Healey, a Wapping receptionist, and had four children, John, Karen, Suzanne and Richard. Later, he left his wife for a sales temp named Joyce - \"legs like Betty Grable, a bust like Jayne Mansfield and a mass of jet-black hair piled on her head\". During this time, Carr tried time and time again to quit smoking, or at least reduce his cigarette consumption. When he did cut down, he found himself obsessing about the cigarettes he was not smoking. For a while he used a pipe, but it hurt his tongue. When his father died painfully of lung cancer at the age of 56, he promised to give up. But he did not. He kept on and on, his failures mounting and beginning to haunt him. He developed a terrible cough. Nothing worked; not the switch to cigars, not the promise to his wife. Then, on the morning of July 15 1983, Carr hit rock bottom. Getting into his car, he had a coughing fit, followed by a nosebleed. When the nosebleed stopped, he lit a cigarette. The nosebleed started again. His wife discovered him sitting in the car, bloodied cigarette dangling from his mouth. That same day, he saw a hypnotist, who did not cure him. But later that day, he read a medical textbook, and saw the light. What Carr had seen was the central tenet of his Easyway method of quitting. Smoking, he reasoned, rather than being pleasurable, was merely a device to get rid of withdrawal symptoms - \"like banging your head against a brick wall in order to feel better when you stop\". He gave up immediately, and started a clinic from his home in Surrey. Throughout the 1980s, Carr's thesis is said to have cured thousands of smokers, including Sir Richard Branson, Ruby Wax and Sir Anthony Hopkins. He eventually opened 30 clinics in Britain, and an empire of 70 more in 30 countries. His book The Easyway to Stop Smoking, published in 1985, has sold several million copies. He also wrote books on how to stop smoking for women, on how to stop your children smoking and on how to control over-eating and alcohol consumption. There is speculation that Carr's lung cancer, diagnosed last summer, might have been the result of working in his clinics - he spent years sitting in smoke-filled rooms, trying to tell people that their addiction was an illusion. When his cancer was found to be inoperable, he said he was less shocked than he might have imagined. \"I've cured 25m smokers over the years,\" he said, \"and if my illness is the price for that, it's worth paying.\" He is survived by Joyce, the children of his first marriage, 11 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. \u00b7 Allen Carr, anti-smoking therapist, born September 2 1934; died November 29 2006"}, "isHosted": false}}}
