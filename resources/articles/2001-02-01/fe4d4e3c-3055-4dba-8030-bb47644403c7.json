West was expected back to play in County's 2-1 defeat at Charlton on Tuesday but had failed to arrive by yesterday. \"He's now expected back this evening and nothing should be read into his late arival,\" said the player's agent Ian Anderson. \"Sometimes it's very difficult to get out of Africa.\" The Derby manager Jim Smith will wait to hear West's explanation before deciding what, if any, action to take. \"If he's been kidnapped in the Congo then that's obviously out of his control,\" Smith said. \"But if he's late back for no good reason then that's a different matter.\" West joined Derby for three months after his release from Internazionale and, with the short-term contract almost at an end, Smith was concerned the player had absented himself to talk to another Italian club.\"The Italian window for signings closes tonight and we hold the player's registration. So time is running out for an Italian club to get in touch with us asking for it,\" Smith explained. \"He's agreed to stay with us until the end of the season and the contract just needs his signature. He's an important part of my plans and we need him to stay with us.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
