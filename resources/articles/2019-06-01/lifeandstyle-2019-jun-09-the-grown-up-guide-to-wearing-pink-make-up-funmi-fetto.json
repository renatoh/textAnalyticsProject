I didn\u2019t get the job. Sartorially, matchy-matchy is a faux pas \u2013 but not so in beauty. At Vivienne Hu, pink was used on lids, cheeks and lips with aplomb. The key to success IRL is to vary tones and texture, eg pale matte pink on cheeks, a deeper shade on eyes and a hint of gloss on the lips. Add a dark eyeliner, mascara and strong brow and you won\u2019t resemble a walking homage to Barbie. 1. MAC Let\u2019s Mesa Round Lipstick \u00a317.50, maccosmetics.com 2.

Pat McGrath Mini Lust Trio in Cool \u00a333, selfridges.com I can\u2019t do without... a natural, vegan conditioner for Afro hair Some of the longest conversations I have revolve around Afro hair. I always say my hair talk makes War and Peace look like a subheading. There are many reasons for these ongoing dialogues. Afro hair carries with it a complex history and many women of colour have convoluted relationships with their hair, so detangling all of this takes time. Products also make up a huge part of the conversation. Finding products that work on chemical-free, natural Afro hair (particular with a tight coily pattern) is an unending pilgrimage. Afro hair, surprising to most, is actually quite fragile, has a tendency to dryness and breakage, so needs intense hydration. Alas, most products don\u2019t touch the sides. Curlsmith, a wonderful vegan and organic hair product line, works brilliantly and this treatment serum should be a staple. It is formulated with jojoba, avocado, oat, andiroba, macadamia and apricot, which softens, hydrates and transforms brittle hair. Despite the putty-like texture, it is light enough to be used as a daily moisturiser, but I find it really comes into its own when used as a deep conditioning treatment. The results are phenomenal. Unlike Curlsmith, most brands, shamefully, do not cater for Afro hair, which is another reason I have endless conversations about hair.
