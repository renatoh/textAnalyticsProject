The Warriors are closing in on a deal to secure the services of Gleeson, who is not cup-tied after being left out of the Warrington team that overwhelmed York 56-10 on Saturday. Wigan are thought to have initially offered the full-back Richard Mathers and the centre Darrell Goulding in exchange for Gleeson, who was born in Wigan before being brought up in Australia. The 28-year-old moved to Warrington from St Helens for a fee of about \u00a3200,000 in 2005 in the aftermath of a betting scandal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
