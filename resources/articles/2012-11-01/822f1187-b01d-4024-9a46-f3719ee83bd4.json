Although carers are called in to help the wife, Anne, after she suffers a stroke, the arrangement collapses and virtually the only concession to her deteriorating condition is the introduction of a wheelchair. Anne is fortunate to have George to look after her: many people who are disabled, ill or vulnerable because of age do not have the full-time support of a partner or family. Nevertheless, the escalating costs of long-term care and the government's seeming inability to sort out a solution to meeting these costs, means many people have no choice other than to struggle on alone. Indeed, most prefer to stay in their own homes rather than move into a nursing or residential care home. So if you or someone you are close to is in this position, where can you get help and what can you do to make the best of the situation? Ruthe Isden, spokesperson on social care for charity Age UK, says: \"The best course is to ask for a care assessment with the local authority social services. This may be a specialist assessment for a particular need \u2013 such as aids and adaptations \u2013 or a more comprehensive assessment of the different sorts of help that may be needed to stay at home. \"A range of support may be available, from help with cleaning or transport, or the latest in adaptive technologies to support independence, right through to 24-hour domiciliary care. A social worker will advise on financial thresholds for arranging state funding, or self-funded social care, eligibility for NHS continuing care, and will liaise with family members if required.\" The council may allocate a personal budget for your care, enabling you to choose either to have services arranged for you, or a cash payment made direct to you so you can arrange your own care. Typically, local authorities (LA) provide care only for people assessed as having \"critical\" or \"substantial\" levels of need. If you are deemed to have moderate or low needs, you will probably have to pay for help yourself. You should check whether you are entitled to any benefits, such as Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance. Age UK provides a wide range of information on benefits, assessment and where to find help on its website. Even if you qualify for help, the LA will means test your finances before deciding who will pay for it. If you go into a care home, you will have to pay the full cost if you have savings of more than \u00a323,250. Most LAs also use this limit to determine whether you should pay for services in your own home. But while the value of your property may be taken into account if you are going into a care home, it will not be if you are staying in your house. If you need to boost your income or access a lump sum of cash, some equity release providers \u2013 Partnership and More2Life \u2013 offer \"enhanced\" lifetime mortgages. These offer a higher loan to value ratio than normal to those who have health problems that are expected to reduce their life. Partnership would typically lend up to \u00a340,000 to a man aged 60 who owns a house worth \u00a3200,000. But if that man were diabetic, he would be able to borrow up to \u00a352,800. Interest on these loans is set at the outset - Partnership currently charges 7.65% while More2Life charges 6.99% \u2013 and is rolled up until the property is sold. Case study Several companies offer technology that enables you to alert \"remote carers\" in a call centre if you get into trouble. Anthony Weaver was on manoeuvres with the Queens Lancashire regiment when he fell, and the gun barrel of the rifle he was carrying pierced his jaw, rammed through the roof of his mouth, and exited via his cheek bone. His doctors believe shattered bone was pushed up into his brain cavity, causing an infection which later developed into a tumour. \"Nothing happened for several years, then I was out walking with my wife when I collapsed and started fitting,\" he says. The fits and tumour caused severe damage, leaving him initially unable to use his left arm, then losing sensation on his left side, and eventually haemorrhaging started from his eyes and nose. An operation removed 90% of the tumour, but he now has short-term memory loss, epilepsy and loss of sensation in his left foot. Weaver's wife, Lisa, a teacher who works with troubled children, took long periods of time out of work to look after him, and was on the point of losing her job. The family \u2013 including two children \u2013 was moved to a bungalow by their local authority, but there were still fears of what would happen to Weaver if he fell or had a fit while alone. SSAFA, a charity that helps ex-forces personnel and their families, paid for him to receive a personal alarm pendant and bracelet linked to the Tunstall telecare service. While the pendant allows Weaver to send an alarm to Telecare if he has a fall and is unable to move, the bracelet will alert the Tunstall call centre if he becomes unconscious for any length of time.. This has given Lisa Weaver confidence to return to work full time. Her husband says: \"She knows that if anything happens she'll get a call from Carelink.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
