Worse still that final crash was virtually identical to his first, suggesting he was failing to learn from his mistakes. It had been a sobering weekend after the elation of a debut F1 win in the previous round in Spain, and in Montreal the Mercedes\u2019 executive director, Toto Wolff, stirred things further. \u201cMax Verstappen acts more like a teenager. In the car he\u2019s extremely good but, when you interact with him, he\u2019s a kid,\u201d he said. Already doubtless banned from a night on the cider, hanging around outside the chippy trying to impress girls with the moves on his BMX after Monaco, this will have stung. His reaction was a drive of exceptional maturity to hold off the charging Nico Rosberg at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. Verstappen defended fourth from Rosberg for several laps toward the end of the race with all the skill of a seasoned pro and was so successful that eventually a frustrated Rosberg was forced into a spin. \u201cMonaco was a tough weekend for him,\u201d said Red Bull\u2019s team principal, Christian Horner. \u201cBut the way he has bounced back here, the confidence he has had, throwing the car around, was great. It was a pretty mature drive for somebody that Mr Wolff said was not quite as mature as he thought. He looked pretty mature to me when he was fending off his very experienced driver.\u201d 2) Sebastian \u2013 the bird man Lewis Hamilton\u2019s relationship with his team-mate, Nico Rosberg, will not have improved after they touched at turn one, indeed a \u201cpissed off\u201d Rosberg left the track without doing his usual press briefing. Seeing his championship lead almost disappear in the space of two races will not have helped. But a frosty atmosphere between team-mates is nothing new, especially when there is a world championship at stake. However, in contrast, Hamilton\u2019s relationship with Sebastian Vettel seems to be reaching new heights of mutual appreciation. Vettel had explained in the post-race press conference how he had swerved to avoid two lackadaisical and one assumes, deaf, seagulls that had settled on the track. \u201cThere were two seagulls. I think it was a couple that wanted to commit suicide. They were at the apex of turn one. I didn\u2019t want that couple to say goodbye for good, but by the time Lewis came around they just flew off. It wasn\u2019t fair! I brake for animals, Lewis doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said to his and Hamilton\u2019s amusement. He went on to interrupt jocularly a TV interview the world champion was conducting to bring up the seagulls again and the pair turned on a double act like old pals. \u201cI\u2019m like Dr Doolittle, I told them to be there and they were there,\u201d Hamilton rejoined. Seeing the pair taking genuine enjoyment in one another\u2019s company was a pleasure, if one at least partly prompted by the fact that Vettel is, as yet, still not a real threat to Hamilton\u2019s title. 3) Real pace revealed But Vettel might yet make a challenge. As Hamilton pointed out after his win, there is still a long way to go this season \u2013 14 more meetings. Ferrari\u2019s step forward in power was obvious in Canada. The new turbo they had brought to the race put them just under 0.178 seconds off in qualifying compared with five-tenths last year and they were closer in race-pace. But equally encouraging for the chances of a proper fight at the front were the steps Red Bull have made with their Renault engine. In 2015 they finished a lap down from the leaders in Montreal. Yet this year they already have one win and but for the pit stop mistake in Monaco would almost certainly have two. A full one and half seconds off the qualifying pace last year they were within three-tenths last weekend. Indeed, the improvement was plain to see in Verstappen\u2019s defence against Rosberg. \u201cIn previous years Rosberg would have gone past no matter which side he picked. So for Max to be able to defend the way he did \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that 12 months ago,\u201d said Horner. He expects more as well. After the rancour that surrounded Red Bull\u2019s relationship with their engine manufacturer last year, the future is looking much more positive with Horner confident that personnel and structural changes have made for a very encouraging trajectory. The more of this the merrier and while neither team is there yet, Wolff admits the advances will keep Mercedes on their toes. 4) Williams successful but they still need more. Valtteri Bottas did a fine job to secure Williams\u2019 first podium finish of the season and, despite Rosberg dropping places at the start, it was well-deserved. The team\u2019s head of performance, Rob Smedley, made it clear before the race that they would not compromise their design philosophy that favours high-speed circuits such as Montreal, to look for performance at the low-speed tracks such as Monaco, where they scored only one point. He accepts that they will pay the price to make gains at the power tracks because it \u201cplays into where we have developed this car and where we will continue to develop it\u201d. It paid off in Canada, as did the team\u2019s bold decision to one-stop Bottas. Having done so they had the pace on track and beat both the Red Bulls to the line as well as Kimi Raikkonen\u2019s Ferrari. They are a solid fourth in the constructors\u2019 championship, 49 points behind Red Bull and 39 ahead of Force India. Having gone down the high-speed route, they must now make the most of it at the next three races \u2013 all of which will favour their design: Azerbaijan, Austria and Silverstone. 5) Hard times for tyres It appears the exciting new ultrasoft tyre is actually quite dull and not very soft, in cool climes at least. After failing to garner praise at Monaco, Pirelli\u2019s brand new compound for 2016, designed for maximum mechanical grip, continued its rather damp squib performance in Canada. Drivers struggled to switch the rubber on at its debut in Monte Carlo although the wet conditions which cooled the track were not perfect. Then in Canada the same thing happened. The temperatures were low for qualifying and the tyres needed a lap of running before they could be committed to a quick run in qualifying. Lewis Hamilton, who did exactly that on his way to pole, said that \u201cthe ultrasoft is not particularly soft for whatever reason, they\u2019re just such hard compounds; it takes us so long to get the temperature into them.\u201dThe tyre is designed to run in the race and for that purpose may just have too much durability built in. Nico Rosberg said he believed they should have been built far more towards being a qualifying special \u2013 to differentiate them further from the other compounds on offer. The temperature, both here and in Monaco, was certainly playing a part but, with their next outing in Austria where a hot track is not to be guaranteed, it may not be until Singapore where they function at their optimum."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
