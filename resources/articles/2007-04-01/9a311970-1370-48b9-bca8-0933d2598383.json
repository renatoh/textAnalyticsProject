Switch on the television tomorrow afternoon and Eoin Reddan will be scampering around the edges of the Wasps scrum in their all-English encounter with Northampton at the Ricoh Arena. The deposed European champions might even be reminded that there is another pocket-sized scrum-half to rival their beloved Peter Stringer and that the former member of Limerick's Old Crescent club can rise to the big occasion. It was Stringer's blind-side break from a scrum that foxed Serge Betsen and turned the tide in last year's final against Biarritz at the Millennium Stadium. And it was Reddan, at 5ft 8in bigger than Stringer but still dwarfed by those giant forwards, who had his Stringer moment at Adams Park three weeks ago. Wasps had fallen behind to Leinster in their quarter-final when Reddan pounced on a stray pass from his opposite number Chris Whitaker and ran half the length of the field to score a try that hauled Wasps back in to the game. Wasps were rampant after the break when Reddan scored their fourth try too as Leinster were run ragged. This is the time of the season when Wasps, like their pesky insect namesakes, traditionally rediscover their sting. \"He may be unsung outside the club but he's been very important to us,\" said Wasps' captain, Lawrence Dallaglio. \"It's been quite difficult for him this winter, flying out to join Ireland squads and not playing, but his performances have been outstanding. He must be putting serious pressure for the Irish No9 shirt on Stringer and Isaac Boss and I'm sure it won't be long before Eddie O'Sullivan has a long look at him.\" Two years ago, though, Reddan was still in Stringer's shadow. The 26-year-old is a Munster schools and Under-21 player who watched the men in red from the terraces at Thomond Park. He was noticed by the former Ireland and Wasps coach, Warren Gatland, and in the summer of 2005 Wasps offered Reddan the chance to understudy Matt Dawson. Except it did not turn out like that. By the middle of the season and after a shambolic defeat at Llanelli Reddan had deposed the World Cup-winning England scrum-half who eventually retired at the end of the season. Reddan says he owes Dawson an enormous debt and that, rather than resenting the newcomer, Dawson was a constant support. \"I know Matt has his detractors and he even said to me once that rugby was not a popularity contest but with me he was a complete gent. He was always full of advice and very helpful and I still speak to him from time to time. Sometimes you work with coaches who haven't played the game for 30 years. But Matt's advice was always relevant because he was familiar with the way a scrum-half plays in the modern game. \"And Wasps is a club like Munster in some ways. It has an earthy feel to it. I know people say that we don't have our own ground but there is something here you can't recreate, a real team spirit. Wasps have the knack of making shrewd signings, like Matt, or Phil Vickery or Raphael Ibanez. These are quality players but had lost their way a bit and they were grateful to be signed and have felt they owed the club something. Every time you pull on the jersey here, you know it's going to be difficult to hold on to your place. \"In the gym and when we train things are short, sharp and aggressive and well-managed and the system works. There's a real buzz about the place at the moment. But Northampton showed how dangerous they can be last week. You can't discount a side with the likes of Reihana, Spencer and Cohen, and we haven't hit out best form in out last couple of games.\" Meanwhile Reddan, whose contract lasts until the end of next season, has no plans to join Leicester's Irish forwards Leo Cullen and Shane Jennings and his fellow Wasp Jonny O'Connor in returning home. \"If it's not broken, don't fix it,\" he says of his happy life in exile."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
