Obama has met with Xi every year going back to 2012, when Xi was vice-president, for talks on cybersecurity and cyber-attacks, the militarization of the South China Sea, carbon emissions and human rights. China produces 20% of all US imports and is the third-largest consumer of US goods. Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, did not speculate on the risks of derailing the relationship by abruptly canceling the state visit, which is planned for September and which would be the first official visit by a Chinese president since Obama hosted Hu Jintao in 2011. It was the second time in as many weeks that Walker, who has been slipping in presidential polling in Iowa and elsewhere, echoed a high-profile attack line by Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. Last week, Walker called for an end to birthright citizenship after Trump floated the idea in an outline of his immigration policy. Walker appeared to walk back that idea at the weekend. On Monday, after US markets opened steeply down, Trump moved on to China. Walker\u2019s has not been the only voice, however, calling for a cancellation of next month\u2019s festivities. Last month, activists in China and the United States urged Obama to cancel the visit in protest over what they say has been a deteriorating record on human rights under Xi. A petition sent to the White House website said: \u201cSince Xi Jinping came to power, China\u2019s human rights record has kept worsening. \u201cXi\u2019s state visit to the US scheduled for September this year should be cancelled, and all official exchanges with the Chinese government should be suspended until this matter is resolved.\u201d Xi is to pay a state visit to Britain in October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
