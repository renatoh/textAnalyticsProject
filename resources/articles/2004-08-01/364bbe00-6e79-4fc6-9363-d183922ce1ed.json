And it tells Orwell's story about thought-criminal Winston Smith's doomed attempt to stay human in an inhuman world with such clarity that you cannot avoid being caught up in his struggle. The production uses flickering lighting very cleverly, so you soon feel part of the terrible, dead world that Smith inhabits. The success of the piece owes as much to Orwell's marvellous storytelling and striking use of language as it does to anything that Debut do, but the simple staging is effective, and the production is well paced as it builds to its climax of betrayal and double betrayal. Maybe not quite double-plus-good, but definitely not half bad. \u00b7 Until August 30. Box office: 0870 701 5105."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
