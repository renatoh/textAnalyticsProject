Given the predictably ludicrous levels of hype \u2013 Sky Sports News\u2019s Countdown To Kick-Off timer tells us there\u2019s (eek!) just two more days to go! \u2013 it\u2019s tempting to suggest that, as with New Year\u2019s Eve, the Phantom Menace, the Seinfeld finale and lists of things in tea-timely emails, anticipation inevitably leads to disappointment. But somehow Liverpool and Manchester City, who meet in The Game To End All Games And Definitely Decide The Title on Sunday, seem able to dodge that old cliche. We were spoiled in 2017-18 when the four-game series between the sides was a 9-9 aggregate thrillfest, but even last season\u2019s more sedate affairs had their memorable moments: Riyad Mahrez missing that late penalty in the 0-0 at Anfield and John Stones\u2019s goalline clearance when City ended Liverpool\u2019s 20-match unbeaten run to reignite the title race at the Etihad in January. No wonder there is plenty of mutual backslapping about. \u201cFor me Pep is the best manager in the world,\u201d cheered J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cRight now Liverpool is the strongest team in the world!\u201d right-back-atcha-ed Pep Guardiola. This time around, though, the signs aren\u2019t good for City. They\u2019ve not won at Anfield in November since 1930, they\u2019ve never beaten Liverpool in the league on a Sunday despite umpteen attempts and, obviously, Mercury is in retrograde which is, of course, bad news for Guardiola, the Catalan Capricorn. Perhaps of slightly more relevance, they\u2019ve also been Not Quite As Good this season, although when it comes to City that is very much a relative criticism (and we\u2019re not talking about Weird Uncle Fiver\u2019s Tin-fuelled \u201cfriendly feedback\u201d sessions), given they\u2019ve averaged 14,798 points over the past couple of campaigns. The blithering idiots have mustered a mere 25 points from 11 games so far this time around, scoring a frankly embarrassing 34 goals in the process. Ederson is knacked. They\u2019re second. Losers. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side are favourites, then, but he isn\u2019t taking anything for granted. \u201cEveryone has to be in top shape,\u201d he roared. \u201cThe guys who sell the hot dogs have to be in top shape!\u201d Which presumably they will be as long as they stick to selling their wares rather than eating them. Guardiola, meanwhile, was full of praise for his back-up goalkeeper \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re not going to lose because of Kyle Claudio\u201d \u2013 which must have been music to Bravo\u2019s ears. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Niall McVeigh from 8pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Norwich City 0-0 Watford. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThe club\u2019s working so I don\u2019t have to go there on Sunday. I just want to know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m fully focused on the game and I\u2019m certain I\u2019ll be playing. If needs be I can sleep at home, go down to the station, and then get myself to San Mames by car\u201d \u2013 Levante keeper Aitor Fern\u00e1ndez could miss this weekend\u2019s La Liga game at Athletic Bilbao after being called up to attend a polling station on general election day.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cHaving been a Fiver subscriber for a year or two now (it\u2019s a blur, but certainly time I will never get back), it\u2019s clear to me that it is written and read by no more than a few dozen people, many of whom are in the same room. Your tedious insistence that you reach at least 1,056 subscribers is clearly a Trumpesque factasy trotted out in a half-ar$ed effort to conceal from the bean-counters the absolute waste of time and salaries the whole sorry exercise represents. At a rough estimate, 98% of Fiver letters are from Fiver staffers or their mates, at least 50% of whom use the nom de plum \u2018Noble Francis\u2019. A transparently nepotistic farrago \u2013 but that is not a criticism. I have trouble sleeping and The Fiver is cheaper and quicker than own-brand vodka. I\u2019m generally out for the count by line two or the word \u2018Arsenal\u2019, if that occurs earlier. So keep up the good work\u201d \u2013 Steve Butler [it\u2019s 1,057 \u2013 Fiver Ed]. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting this twist, but is Oliver Billenness (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) suggesting Noble Francis\u2019s emails are \u2018prepared by some deepfake Russian bot\u2019?\u201d \u2013 Paddy Reilly. \u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s letters. So, we\u2019re writing to The Fiver to point out mistakes elsewhere on Big Website now? We\u2019re going to need a bigger Fiver Letters\u201d \u2013 Matt Dony. \u201cIs the \u2018Morris-Dancing Fiver\u2019 in your coverage of England\u2019s squad (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs) the son of longtime stalwart \u2018Morris Dancing Fiver\u2019? Or has he simply changed his name to ride the wave of double-barrelled surnames in an effort to secure that elusive first cap?\u201d \u2013 R Reisman. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS England face Germany in front of an 86,619 near-sellout at Wembley on Saturday and Big Phil Neville can\u2019t wait. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest game the team have ever had in terms of the size and I think \u2013 emotionally, physically and tactically \u2013 we need to be at our very best,\u201d he parped. The quarter-finals of Women\u2019s Big Cup are set: Arsenal v PSG, Glasgow City v Wolfsburg, Lyon v Bayern Munich and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid v Barcelona. Manchester United, Wolves, the Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers and the Queen\u2019s Celtic are all basking in the toasty afterglow of Big Vase victories. \u201cWe have qualified after four games. That is unheard of for [the Queen\u2019s] Celtic in Europe,\u201d roared Neil Lennon. Stoke City have appointed Norn Iron manager Michael O\u2019Neill. \u201cNaturally, we are extremely disappointed Michael is leaving,\u201d tooted IFA chief suit Patrick Nelson. \u201cHowever, we are delighted Michael will be in charge for the games against the Netherlands and Germany and potential Euro 2020 play-off matches in March.\u201d Club Brugge striker Mbaye Diagne has been fined and dropped after missing a penalty he wasn\u2019t supposed to take in their 1-0 Big Cup loss to PSG. \u201cIt was a dumb mistake and we are all very cross,\u201d harrumphed coach Philippe Clement. And Sol Campbell is looking forward to Sunday\u2019s FA Cup first-round trip to Dover, despite Southend having picked up a frankly pathetic five points from 17 league games so far this season. \u201cIt won\u2019t be the first time I\u2019ve had one of these rough and tumble games but this is a warm distraction at the moment,\u201d he tooted.
