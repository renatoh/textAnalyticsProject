The website Ultimate Classic Rock (UCR) had posted the image on Facebook, but it was taken down. UCR was told \u201cthere are rules regarding nudity and solicitation that we have to follow\u201d by a Facebook representative after the image was \u201cflagged by other members of the community\u201d. Facebook has now reversed the decision. \u201cAs our community standards explain, we don\u2019t allow nude images of children on Facebook,\u201d a spokesperson told UCR. \u201cBut we know this a culturally significant image. Therefore, we\u2019re restoring the posts we removed.\u201d The cover of the 1973 album was designed by Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis, the collective that became renowned for its cover designs for Pink Floyd, 10cc and others. It features collaged images of a pair of children with their backs turned to the camera, posing on Giant\u2019s Causeway in Northern Ireland. The children in the image, siblings Stefan and Samantha Gates, said in a 2007 interview that they were unfazed by the naked photoshoot. \u201cWe were naked in a lot of the modelling shoots we did, nothing was thought of it back then,\u201d Samantha said. \u201cYou probably couldn\u2019t get away with that now.\u201d The decision comes amid growing consternation at Facebook\u2019s policies on nudity. The US organisation National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC) staged a naked protest outside Facebook\u2019s New York offices earlier this month. \u201cThe nudity ban prevents many artists from sharing their work online,\u201d reads a statement on NCAC\u2019s website. \u201cThe ban disproportionately affects artists whose work focuses on already-marginalised bodies, including queer and gender-non-conforming artists. The policy also prevents museums and galleries from promoting exhibitions featuring nudes.\u201d Facebook has since agreed to re-evaluate its nudity guidelines. This week a separate protest was made against Instagram, owned by Facebook, by sex workers and adult models who argue that the social network\u2019s unpredictable policies on nudity are affecting their livelihoods."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
