Pochettino accepts Tottenham cannot compete financially with the biggest spenders but is determined to strengthen a squad that finished runners-up to Chelsea last season. He has not made a summer buy, with Kyle Walker\u2019s departure for Manchester City the most notable activity. The manager believes complacency can creep in if players are not challenged by new arrivals and made to feel their place is under threat. \u201cHow have Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and different clubs tried to improve their season?\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cBringing players and trying to put more pressure on their star players, their key players \u2013 and for us we need to do that too.\u201d Pochettino pointed out that whereas he arrived at Tottenham in 2014 amid fears that the leading players could leave unless the club qualified for the Champions League, expectations have changed. \u201cRight, now [I hear] we need to win some trophies, no?\u201d he said. \u201cThat is good, the pressure. I think it\u2019s important to understand now that we need to be clever how we manage the expectation and how we need to put pressure on our own players. \u201cWe understand that Dele Alli, Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen, [Eric] Dier, [Toby] Alderweireld are really good players. They want to win but need to feel the pressure a little bit to improve every season. \u201cIf there\u2019s no competition in behind it\u2019s normal to drop your motivation, it\u2019s normal to drop everything that you do. And then it\u2019s difficult to win.\u201d During the recent tour of the United States Tottenham fielded a number of academy products, which yielded mixed results and the realisation that although players such as Josh Onomah, Kyle Walker-Peters and Cameron Carter-Vickers have potential, they are not ready to push first-team regulars. Pochettino said he and Daniel Levy, the chairman, were in agreement regarding transfers. \u201cEvery season we need to be clever in how we bring more energy and make sure our main players are not in a comfortable situation \u2013 because if not it is normal in human beings,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIf some players arrive with different energy then it\u2019s: \u2018OK, come on, we need to push, we need to run, we need to do the same.\u2019 That is the risk we will have in the future if we only keep 11 players. \u201cWe are finding the balance because now is the moment to maybe refresh the team with some new faces \u2013 and it\u2019s sure that will happen. In three years, my experience with Daniel has always been trying to find a player to improve. The difference is were they the right or wrong signing?\u201d Tottenham broke their transfer record last summer for Moussa Sissoko, who has not proved he is worth \u00a330m. Fees have continued to rise, with significant outlay in this window by City (\u00a3200m-plus), Manchester United (around \u00a3140m) and Chelsea (around \u00a3120m). Levy has described the spending as \u201cunsustainable\u201d. \u201cThe problem is so clear,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe are not a club today that can compete with Manchester United and City for a player. We cannot fight. We are in a different way. But the thing is Daniel is very keen to sign like me. These type of player we are talking about they are not easy to find.\u201d Everton\u2019s Ross Barkley is a prime target for Pochettino, though the demands regarding fee and wages would need to drop for Levy to sanction the move. The midfielder recently rejected a contract at Goodison Park which would have taken his wages to around \u00a3100,000 a week and paying \u00a335m for a player in the final year of his contract deal does not sit easily with the Tottenham hierarchy. Pochettino was happy to allow Walker to leave in the belief that Kieran Trippier, who made his England debut this summer, is ready to step up at right-back. \u201cThe problem here is what happens when you say, \u2018I am No1\u2019, \u2018I am No2\u2019,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cAnd the No1 believes they have more right than another and the other feels he is less. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to manage that situation. That\u2019s why as a manager you must give the possibility to rotate when they\u2019re at the same level. But we are so relaxed and so calm. There is no doubt in what we are trying to do.\u201d Pochettino disclosed that \u00c1lvaro Morata, Chelsea\u2019s new \u00a358m striker, previously rejected a move to Tottenham for fear that he would be unable to compete with Kane. The revelations are likely to increase the intensity of the relationship between the two managers, with Conte angering Pochettino last week for questioning his ambition and declaring his admiration for Kane. \u201cMorata talked about myself, in the media \u2013 he said: \u2018Mauricio called me,\u2019\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cThat was from the beginning, two years ago or more. He said to me: \u2018Why do you want me if you have Harry Kane?\u2019 You know, if you go to try to sign a striker, they will say: \u2018Eh, gaffer, you want me for what? To be on the bench?\u201d Tottenham take on Juventus at Wembley in their final pre-season fixture on Saturday 5 August.
