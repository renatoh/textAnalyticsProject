By then the adrenaline had subsided, muscles stiffening as the pain in his ankle finally kicked in, though he could still wear the bruising as a badge of honour. It was the legacy of a hack at the Belgian\u2019s heels, the closest Francis Coquelin had come to checking Hazard\u2019s glorious, scuttling run from inside his own half just after the break, a charge that had in effect culminated in the dismissal of Arsenal\u2019s title challenge. Hazard can usually measure the impact he has had on an occasion by counting the scuff marks and scars which are covering his body in the aftermath. There was a time, not long ago, when he might have been subdued by such crude treatment. The clattering he took from Shkodran Mustafi midway through the first half would have sufficed, a challenge which had the Chelsea player sprawling and winded after landing awkwardly on a hip, and led to the German being booked. \u201cBut it\u2019s true, when I get a lot of kicks, I feel really in the game,\u201d Hazard said. \u201cAnd when people don\u2019t touch me, it tells me I\u2019m not doing well. No good. I\u2019m not saying I like to be kicked, but it\u2019s good for me to feel I am in the game. Definitely. A motivation. \u201cI try to be this kind of player: the type who does something whenever he gets the ball. Sometimes in the past I\u2019ve gone through games where I\u2019ve not touched the ball for 20 or 30 minutes. These days I\u2019m always trying to have lots of touches, to be involved and to play my football for 90 minutes. The manager asks a lot of me. A lot. When we don\u2019t have the ball, he wants me to defend, to close inside and be ready to chase the diagonal [pass], and when we do have it I have to counterattack and be free, always trying to do some \u2018magic\u2019 like I did here. With experience, you improve. I\u2019m a better player now, more complete than I was when I was player of the year.\u201d He earned that accolade two seasons ago, when Chelsea claimed the title by eight points and leant heavily upon the playmaker\u2019s zest when the campaign became more of a slog from its midway point. Hazard contributed 14 goals. He boasts 10 this time round with the latest \u2013 a skip away from Laurent Koscielny, twice, and Coquelin which allied close control, balance and unnerving strength, and a smart finish across Petr Cech \u2013 \u201cone of the best\u201d of his career. He left Mustafi sprawling before the end, the centre-half anticipating a dart on the outside and toppling over while Hazard calmly checked back and spread the play in-field. He tormented Arsenal with a smirk on his face. \u201cWe all enjoyed this game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to score this kind of beautiful goal in a big game, and this was a big game.\u201d Chelsea considered that reward an exorcism for the hammering endured at the Emirates Stadium in September, with Antonio Conte\u2019s delight unconfined. Both managers ended up in among the Chelsea fans on Saturday: the suspended Ars\u00e8ne Wenger reluctantly, ignoring the click of smartphone cameras delighting in his every pained wince; the other gleefully, head buried in among the east stand support in celebration. \u201cWe are in a good place,\u201d said Hazard, his team 30 points better off than at the same stage last season, before mimicking his manager\u2019s words of caution over what lies ahead. The title is not won yet. The chasing pack could still rally. There are threats at Chelsea\u2019s back. But surely not from Arsenal. The gap between these teams now gapes at 12 points, with everything about this defeat indicative of a familiar seasonal choke from Wenger\u2019s team. At least Coquelin had an excuse, of sorts, for his inability to suffocate Hazard\u2019s sprint. The French midfielder had been hampered by a hamstring complaint in the buildup only for Arsenal\u2019s lack of midfield options \u2013 Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla are injured, Granit Xhaka suspended, Mohamed Elneny in Gabon with Egypt and Jack Wilshere on loan to Bournemouth \u2013 to necessitate his inclusion. He had competed as well as could be expected of him, particularly during the first half when the visitors, aggrieved at the award of the hosts\u2019 opener after Marcos Alonso inadvertently left H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn concussed, had at least stayed in contention. Yet there was no excusing the wilt thereafter. Wenger did not attempt to deflect where his own team\u2019s deficiencies had been most evident. \u201cWe lacked some maturity in the buildup and were caught many times on the counterattack,\u201d he offered through a deflated monotone. \u201cIt\u2019s always worrying. Even our experienced players were not at their best, individually.\u201d These are the occasions when a team needs its stellar performers, but Cech was panicked, Alexis S\u00e1nchez infuriated and isolated. Whereas Hazard thrived, Mesut \u00d6zil was anonymous. The German looked shattered on the final whistle, socks round his ankles and tape stripped and discarded on the turf, apparently exhausted by his efforts. Yet, one scuffed shot at the near-post aside, it was hard to recall him summoning anything of note all afternoon. He ended up almost setting the tone of the entire team, plodding aimlessly through the game with no real urgency and even less conviction. In contrast, Chelsea\u2019s leaders always felt authoritative and influential, fuelled by N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9\u2019s tireless running and blur of interceptions. Therein lay the real difference between the sides, a familiar failing which damned the visitors. Hazard may have left with a limp, but Arsenal\u2019s challenge had proved feeble."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
