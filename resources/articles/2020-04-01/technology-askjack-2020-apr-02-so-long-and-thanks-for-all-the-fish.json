Jack was taken to hospital on Friday night following a heart attack and died on Tuesday afternoon. Jack spanned many different editors over his 37 years at the Guardian, including his last few with me. He will be sorely missed by those of us that knew him at the Guardian, but most of all by his readers. To those who have read, commented and emailed Ask Jack over the last 20 years, we want to thank you for being part of it. Jack leaves behind an extensive archive of columns and many more pieces before that in the paper and dating all the way back to 1989 in his online archive. He will not be forgotten."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
