In the centre of the fairway but 230 yards from the front of the green, Rose pulled a four-iron from his bag and rifled the shot to just short of the green. His ball took a hop and then rolled the length of the green, missing the pin by inches. The Englishman sank the putt from four feet to record the tournament's first eagle. Strop of the day Tiger Woods entered before his round had even begun, but was pipped at the the last by Colin Montgomerie 's Kournikova-like critique of Radio 5 Live's interrogation . Shirt of the day No contest. Duffy Waldorf might be up with the leaders, but that really is no excuse. Number of the day Not 15 , fortunately. Ian Woosnam's caddie Lee Adelly ensured the Welshman's first round did not get off to the same calamitous start as his final round last year, having apparently spent the week counting and re-counting Woosnam's clubs. Quote of the day Ian Poulter \"It's a very nice start even though I didn't get off to the best of starts.\" Rude member Bernhard Langer 's young son, nervously trying to mind his own business, found himself being barked at by one of Muirfield's honourable members for having the temerity to watch events unfold on the 18th green from in front of the clubhouse window, thereby blocking the view of the clearly far more important people inside - 99% of whom were tucking into their lunch at the time. Rough Ryders Continuing our series of Ryder Cup players who can hardly hit their hats, we had our pick of the Europeans yesterday but opted for Lee Westwood , who shot a one-over-par 72. Westwood has played in 17 tournaments this year and failed to record a top-10 placing. Luckily, some of the American team are also struggling: Mark Calcavecchia hardly looked worthy of his captain's pick after struggling to a three-over 73. Ballspotters' corner Thailand's Jaidee Thongchai leads the open driving distance table with an average belt of 326 yards. The former soldier averaged fully 90 yards further than Pierre Fulke, whose limp efforts were flying a mere 236 yards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
