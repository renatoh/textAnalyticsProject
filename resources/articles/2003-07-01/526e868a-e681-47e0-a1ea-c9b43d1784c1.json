The report piled further pressure on the US authorities to explain how crudely-forged documents relating to Iraqi attempts to buy uranium from Niger might have been used to argue for a war. Elisabetta Burba, a journalist at the current affairs magazine Panorama, said she received the documents in October 2002 but concluded they did not stand scrutiny and passed them to US diplomats in Rome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
