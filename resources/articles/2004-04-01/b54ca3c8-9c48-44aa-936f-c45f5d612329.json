But this time he is not only staying true to his declaration, he is working determinedly and quickly to implement it ... From the time he went public with his initiative, and until the Likud membership referendum, 12 weeks will have passed. If Likud, the cabinet, and the Knesset all approve the initiative, Sharon's plan may be deemed, to paraphrase Churchill, the beginning of the end of the occupation. The beginning of the end of the occupation Editorial, New York Times Mr. Sharon's idea of unilateral withdrawal is not really unilateral. In exchange, he wants the United States to give him a free hand in the West Bank. His plan includes dismantling some token settlements in that area and that would be it - the end of the process, with Israel's security wall as the final border. This is something the United States cannot endorse ... There can be no realistic substitute for a negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. That will never happen without Israeli withdrawal of most of its settlements. The United States cannot allow Mr. Sharon to manoeuvre it into sanctioning an indefinite Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Gaza first, but not last (registration required) Naomi Chazan, Jerusalem Post The present turmoil over the disengagement plan within the Likud fits the bill almost perfectly. Sharon's proposal to exit Gaza (and evacuate a handful of settlements in the West Bank) cannot at the moment pass muster within the government. The politically risky (and democratically questionable) move to hold a referendum within the Likud on these unilateral steps is Sharon's only hope of hanging on to power. This is precisely where George W Bush comes in. Whether the president is aware of it or not, he is being cast in the role of Ariel Sharon's saviour. A brief session in the oval office can assure Sharon's victory in the Likud referendum and prolong his precarious tenure in office. Stay at home, Mr Sharon (registration required) Alexander Jacobson, Maariv What would happen if Sharon loses the party survey about the \"disengagement\"? Such a vote of no-confidence by the members of his party on such a key issue will surely not allow him to remain in his office. Those who are afraid withdrawal from Gaza will be viewed by the Palestinians as a victory have to ask themselves how the Palestinians would interpret Sharon's downfall. Surely they would view it as a major victory: \"The intifada defeated Sharon\" - just as they predicted from its start. Arafat would be happy to add Sharon to the list of Israeli prime ministers he has toppled. If Sharon is defeated Boston Globe Many of Sharon's allies on the Israeli political right contend that his plan to withdraw from Gaza will be perceived as a victory for Palestinian militant groups that have waged a three-and-a-half-year campaign of bombings and shooting attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers. Many of Sharon's allies also object to what they see as his abandonment of the settlers, whom he has championed throughout his career.
