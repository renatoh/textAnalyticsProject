Its successor finds him back in Stockport, 'back to being who I was before', as the first song announces. One Plus One is probably a more straightforwardly enjoyable album for it, with amiable romps such as 'Four Leaf Clover' contrasting with elegant flute and harpsichord-laden folk episodes that underline Gough's debt to Elliott Smith. What's new here is the Boy's deadpan metaphysics. He invites us to trust the universe; recommends singing to kill off devils in 'Another Devil Dies'. 'The Year Of The Rat', meanwhile, urges us to 'find some new energy'. Unfortunately, the latter is marred by a cloying children's choir, one that resurfaces on 'Holy Grail', the album's equally overcooked finale. Gough is at his best when he steers whimsy away from sentimentality, something that doesn't always happen here. Kings of Convenience Riot On An Empty Street (Source/Virgin) Three years ago, the debut album by the Norse folk duo Kings of Convenience suggested that 'quiet' might be the new 'loud'. The Kings were right, insofar as the mellow moods of Norah Jones and Radio 2 soon became the dominant sounds of the early decade. Theoretically, then, the path should be clear for the Kings' triumphant return after three years of studying psychology (Eirik Glambek Boe) and discovering electronic music (Erlend Oye). But KOC's second album is a mixed affair. Lacking the shock of the new that made their debut such a talking point, Riot On An Empty Street ups the chirpy bossa nova quotient in the pair's Simon &amp; Garfunkel folk-pop. Their most regrettable indie tendencies are laid bare, too, on 'I'd Rather Dance With You'. But bookending the record's low points are lovely, intimate songs - like 'Homesick' or 'The Build Up', which features the new vocal presence of Canadian songbird Leslie Feist. All things considered, their limpid and sombre tunes still beat the hordes of 'big in Ireland' singer-songwriters hands down. Matt Goss The Other Side Of Later (Concept Music) It's somewhat inevitable that Matt Goss's indenture in Hell's Kitchen should have produced one particular platter - this new solo album the former Bros hunk obviously hoped to flog by donning chef's whites and letting Mr Sweary be rude about his spag bol. Thanks to some sarf London stoicism, Goss actually emerged from Hell's Kitchen as a likeable sort. If only the pop mincer were so kind. The Other Side Of Later is the sort of mature solo album that former pop stars write in their dotage: thoughtful, a little contrite, rather too keen to demonstrate that the singer's vocal range has been improved by life experience. There's lashings of George Michael-lite here; great dollops of cod-soul and banality stacked upon glutinous banality. It's better than, say, Peter Andre's recent comeback album. But still: pap. Orbital Blue Album (IHT) The twilight of dance culture has swallowed up two more old soldiers: Orbital, who will bow out with a final performance at Glastonbury and this album. The Blue Album boasts some excellent reminders of why the Hartnoll brothers have been so justly revered. 'Acid Pants' - with Sparks as guests - revisits their roots as organ grinders of the rave boom; there's room, too, for the Hartnolls' Kraftwerk and Michael Nyman fetishes. The terrific 'You Lot', meanwhile, borrows a Christopher Ecclestone sample about man's hubris, and superimposes it on to typically contorting counter-melodies and euphoric builds. Even so, it's not a flawless swan song - 'One Perfect Sunrise' ends the album on a ghastly chillout note. But Orbital's last dance remains a testament to the orchestral inventiveness and emotional pull of music that was once, quaintly, thought to be an aerobic soundtrack for E-guzzling oiks and a public menace to boot. Wilco A Ghost Is Born (Nonesuch) Alt-country bores who despair of Wilco's latterday sidle into left-field sonics should note that 'Less Than You Think', the penultimate song on Wilco's fifth album, features a 10-minute passage of oscillating white noise. For all that, this successor to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is actually a more conventional-sounding record than its predecessor. 'The Late Greats' is an easygoing chug, and 'Theologians' is a Band-like workout. But Jeff Tweedy and his rotating cast remain fearless with guitars. 'Spiders (Kidsmoke)' is as fine a piece of motorik Americana as has ever been penned; and there is plenty of lyrical darkness to match the euphoric guitar solos on songs like 'At Least That's What You Said'. Phoenix Alphabetical (Source/Virgin) There is normally no excuse for funk rock, the most execrable musical genre ever to sully the air. Undisputed pop craftsmen like Daft Punk and N.E.R.D. have both made flawed albums in recent years, influenced by the easy-listening guitar rock of the Seventies. They've been totally outclassed here by Phoenix, four men from Versailles. Phoenix's half-hour-long second album of impeccably crafted French filtered rock has no right to sound this good, given its debt to Steely Dan. And yet Alphabetical turns this flaccid, over-rich sound source into a pop swoon, one that marries exquisite sonic precision and fuzzy wonder. Phoenix wear their eclectic tastes lightly. 'Run Run Run' rides a processed country twang into the haze; 'Victim Of the Crime' refashions melancholy bells into a nagging, Dr Dre-style hook, and '(You Can't Blame It On) Anybody' shuffles and aahs its way under your skin with an ease that's almost chemical. An early contender for feelgood album of the summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
