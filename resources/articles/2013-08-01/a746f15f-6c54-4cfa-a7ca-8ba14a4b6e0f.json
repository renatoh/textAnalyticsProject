None of Strachan's Scottish team has faced England before. The manager, however, both played in the match and has taken charge of Celtic in Old Firm fixtures. Those experiences have taught Strachan of the dangers attached to letting aggression get out of hand. If there is to be Braveheart spirit at Wembley, Strachan insisted, it will come from Scottish fans rather than players. \"You don't get carried away with this passion thing; fighting, scrapping, we are the Scots and you took land off us so many hundred years ago. Forget that,\" Strachan said. \"If you are really passionate, jump higher, run quicker, run further. That's the way, not going fighting, screaming at referees and crashing into people. \"I always felt that the first team who lost their temper in an Old Firm match generally lost the game. There would be players on either side who, just to keep the fans happy, would go careering into tackles and kick someone up in the air. Then people would clap when they were sent off. \"I loved that; we are down to 10 men and you are clapping him, he's a hero. Not really, he's not a hero at all. He's indisciplined. OK, you could be unfortunate sometimes but I never bought that clapping thing when someone was sent off.\" Albeit refusing to name names, Strachan said he had team-mates who would become overawed by matches such as this, the oldest international in world football. \"They did,\" added the Scotland manager. \"And because they went crashing into tackles, the crowd cheered then we realised we were defending a free-kick because someone went crashing into a tackle.\" Still, Strachan admitted the buildup to the first meeting of England and Scotland since 1999 has been different to what he has encountered during his early months in international management. \"We will have to see how the game goes, how passionate it is,\" Strachan said. \"But in terms of who wants tickets, there is an enthusiasm to be at the game. Friendlies, as a player and a manager, I just couldn't get. This is a friendly but it is competitive, so that is different. Football players will take anything that is competitive seriously.\" Unsurprisingly, Strachan refused to be drawn into debate over whether England have underachieved as a team or the current, fevered discussion surrounding one of the players Scotland will come up against, Wayne Rooney. Strachan cited logistics as the main reason for Scotland not training at Wembley in advance of facing Roy Hodgson's team. The Scots have spent this week in St Albans. \"If it had been a 15-minute journey, we might have done it,\" Strachan explained. \"Sometimes you might go just to test the surface because they can be different but if there is anything better than the Watford training ground that we have been using, I would be very surprised. \"We don't want to be like holiday makers, going up to Wembley and getting our pictures taken. I think they are professional enough, they all know everything about the place.\" Scott Brown will captain Scotland in the continued absence of Darren Fletcher, who will look on from the Wembley stands. Gary Caldwell, Strachan's vice captain, is also recovering from injury. A more immediate worry for Scotland is in defence, with Grant Hanley's training session on Tuesday cut short by a hamstring problem. Strachan is short on alternatives at centre-back. Brown displayed only an element of devilment when asked by an English reporter on Tuesday if Scottish football is afforded a suitable level of respect south of the border. \"Well, could you name me a couple of Kilmarnock players?\" replied Brown. The Celtic midfielder hails from the same Fife mining village as the late Jim Baxter, who famously taunted England by playing keepy-uppy on the Wembley pitch as Scotland beat the then world champions in 1967. Brown knows he could create his own little bit of history by captaining the visitors to another win. \"There will always be emotion at an England v Scotland game,\" Brown said. \"There will be emotion for all of us, there always is for Scotland's players and fans. But we need to bring some composure to the game as well.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
