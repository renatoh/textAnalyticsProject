Now she is turning the skills she has developed in her writing to examine a much more modern theme \u2013 how fact and fiction can become confused to produce \u201calternative facts\u201d. The author of Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies, the first two parts of a planned trilogy charting the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell, is using this year\u2019s BBC Reith Lectures to explore the genre in which she made her name. She tells the Observer: \u201cFacts and alternative facts, truth and verisimilitude, knowledge and information, art and lies: what could be more timely or topical than to discuss where the boundaries lie? \u201cIs there a firm divide between myth and history, fiction and fact: or do we move back and forth on a line between, our position indeterminate and always shifting?\u201d The phrase \u201calternative facts\u201d has been gaining traction since the first chaotic media briefing by US president Donald Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, who cited figures that were widely denounced as falsehoods. A White House colleague, Kellyanne Conway, defended him by saying he had been presenting alternative facts. In a world away from the frenzied atmosphere of contemporary US politics, Mantel will take the podium on Monday for the first of five lectures around the UK and in Belgium. Titled Resurrection: The Art and Craft, they will be broadcast over the course of the summer from 13 June on BBC Radio 4. Monday\u2019s lecture will be recorded at Hall\u00e9 St Peter\u2019s in Manchester, a city with which Mantel has a personal link. She will argue that art can bring the dead back to life, starting with the story of her own great-grandmother. \u201cIt is apt for me to open the series in Manchester, as well as a pleasure to revisit a city that is almost home ground. I grew up on the fringe of the Peak District as a child of a mill-working family,\u201d says Mantel, who will describe how and why she began to write fiction about the past. \u201cIn the first lecture I will talk about what I know of their Irish roots, and introduce the figure of my great-grandmother who, though she could not read or write, helped me construct my own identity as someone who reverences the past.\u201d In a second lecture, titled The Iron Maiden and recorded at Middle Temple in London, Mantel will ask how pictures of the past are constructed and from where evidence is gleaned. She warns against two familiar errors: either romanticising the past, or seeing it as a gory horror show, adding that it is tempting but often condescending to seek modern parallels for historical events. \u201cAre we looking into the past, or looking into a mirror?\u201d she asks. \u201cDead strangers \u2026 did not live and die so we could draw lessons from them.\u201d In two subsequent lectures, recorded in Antwerp and close to her adopted home in east Devon, she will first tell the story of how an obsessive relationship with history killed the young Polish writer Stanislawa Przybyszewska, and then delve into the practical job of getting historical fiction on to the page. \u201cThe historian will always wonder why you left certain things out, while the literary critic will wonder why you left them in,\u201d she says. A final lecture, Adaptation, will examine how fiction changes when adapted for stage and screen, with Mantel arguing that well-written fiction does not betray history but enhances it. The same applies to theatre, film or television, according to the writer, whose work has spawned something of a mini-industry in its own right. Stage adaptations of Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies have both been critically acclaimed, as has a \u00a37m BBC television adaptation of the two by Peter Kosminsky, in which Mark Rylance plays Thomas Cromwell. Inaugurated by the BBC in 1948, the lectures mark the historic contribution made to public service broadcasting by Sir John (later Lord) Reith, the corporation\u2019s first director general. Previous lecturers have included Bertrand Russell, Robert Oppenheimer, JK Galbraith, Aung San Suu Kyi and Stephen Hawking. Radio 4 has released the first official Reith 2017 portrait of Mantel by the award-winning photographer Richard Ansett, from a collection of images that will accompany the series. The lectures herald a departure from the relatively low public profile kept by Mantel, who nonetheless has not shied away from controversy. Speaking last month at the Oxford Literary festival, she suggested that some of her rivals in the genre of historical fiction spent their lives \u201cin apologetic cringing\u201d because they felt that they were \u201csome inferior form of historian\u201d. Separately, some commentators have filed Mantel\u2019s imagining of the assassination of Margaret Thatcher, a short story published in 2014 described as \u201cwarped\u201d and a \u201cdistasteful fantasy\u201d by the Daily Mail, as alternative history."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
