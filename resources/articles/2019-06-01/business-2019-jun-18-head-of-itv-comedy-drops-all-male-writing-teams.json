Saskia Schuster took action after an audit of her shows revealed \u201can awful lot\u201d of all-male teams and a \u201csignificant lack\u201d of women in scripted commissions. She said for every five scripts sent to her by a man, she would receive just one by a woman. \u201cToo often the writing room is not sensitively run. It can be aggressive and slightly bullying,\u201d Schuster told Diverse Festival on Monday, according to the BBC, where she featured in a panel discussion titled \u201cwhy employing more women writers in comedy matters\u201d. After consulting writers, producers, agents and performers, Schuster, whose commissions include Benidorm and CelebAbility, said she changed her terms of commission and refused any offering written exclusively by men. \u201cI won\u2019t commission anything with an all-male writing team.\u201d Writer Brona C Titley, who works on Celebability, told the festival: \u201cIf you have the same type of writers in terms of race or sexual orientation or gender, then you\u2019re only getting one kind of joke.\u201d Schuster has pushed for equality in comedy writing for years in her role in ITV. She founded the initiative Comedy 50:50 in February 2018 after becoming inspired by an event about gender equality in the industry at Bafta and realising that \u201cas the comedy commissioner at ITV, it\u2019s up to me to drive the narrative\u201d. She discovered female writers were often at a disadvantage because men usually already had more writing credits, because it was hard to find producers who \u201cget\u201d their voices and develop their scripts and the fact that \u201cfemale writers often don\u2019t thrive as the lone female voice in the writing room\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
