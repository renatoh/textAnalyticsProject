In an ITV interview during a campaign visit to a factory in Sunderland, the prime minister was challenged about the plight of Jack Williment-Barr, who was pictured sleeping under coats on a hospital floor in Leeds as he waited for a bed, despite having suspected pneumonia. Johnson refused to look at the photo and, out of camera shot, eventually took the phone from the reporter and put it in his own pocket. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, responded by tweeting a video of the exchange with the message: \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d First asked if he had seen the photographs, Johnson said he had not. The ITV reporter, Joe Pike, then showed the prime minister the photograph on his phone, describing what it portrayed. Johnson declined to look at the picture, saying: \u201cI understand. And obviously, we have every possible sympathy for everybody who has a bad experience in the NHS.\u201d He went on to discuss investment in the NHS and Brexit. Pike pressed the prime minister: \u201cI\u2019m talking about this boy, prime minister. How do you feel, looking at that photo?\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cOf course. And let me tell you \u2026 I haven\u2019t had a chance to look at it.\u201d Pike asked: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look at it now, prime minister?\u201d Johnson, still not looking at the photo, replied: \u201cI\u2019ll study it later.\u201d Pressed again, he said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll give you an interview now. What we are doing is we are taking this country forward, and we are investing in the NHS.\u201d Johnson then appeared, out of camera shot, to take the phone out of Pike\u2019s hand and put it into his coat pocket. The reporter challenged him on this: \u201cYou\u2019ve refused to look at the photo, you\u2019ve taken my phone and put it in your pocket, prime minister. His mother says the NHS is in crisis. What\u2019s your response to that?\u201d At this point, Johnson removed the phone and looked at the picture for the first time: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible photo, and I apologise, obviously, to the family and all of those who have terrible experiences in the NHS. But what we are doing is supporting the NHS and on the whole, I think patients in the NHS have a much, much better experience than this poor kid has had.\u201d Johnson ended by handing back the phone: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have taken your phone. There you go.\u201d At a subsequent media Q&amp;A at the factory, Johnson was twice asked about his reaction in the interview, but declined to address the questions, instead talking about investment in the NHS. Johnson has previously been accused of showing a lack of empathy, for example during a speech at a police training college in September, when he pressed on with a speech even after a cadet directly behind him half-collapsed. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, tweeted: \u201cDon\u2019t give this disgrace of man 5 more years to carry on driving our NHS into the ground. Sick toddlers like Jack deserve so much better.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
