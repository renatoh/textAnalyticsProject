Not only did the team lose the Tour of Spain after leading for the entire race, the team manager Manolo Saiz lost his head and may face a lengthy ban for bringing the sport into disrepute. Lance Armstrong's team-mate Roberto Heras snatched the race lead - and overall victory - from ONCE's Isidro Nozal in an epic final time-trial on Saturday to the top of the Alto de Abantos mountain outside Madrid. Nozal had led the race for 16 stages but his strength deserted him over the seven uphill miles, and Heras overturned his 1min 55sec deficit, bursting into tears at the finish after sealing his second Vuelta win. All that remained was yesterday's brief stage in the centre of Madrid where the Italian sprinter Alessandro Petacchi took his fifth stage win. Heras forged his victory by chipping away at Nozal's lead - five minutes a week ago - in the final few days, culminating with an attack on Friday's mountain stage over the Navacerrada pass in the Sierra de Madrid. Nozal limited his losses but left Heras within reach before Saturday's decider. The wooded slopes of the Navacerrada also saw off Saiz who drove his car through the peloton and forced a television camera motorbike on to the side of the road where he and a mechanic threatened the driver and cameramen. Saiz believed the motorbike had been assisting Heras by enabling him to sit in the slipstream, and the cameraman was on hand to capture his angry outburst: \"I shit on your whore-mother. I will kill you and cut you into little pieces.\" Saiz is famously intemperate - in the 1998 Tour de France he left the race with the words, \"I have stuck my finger up the Tour de France's arse\" - and he had already threatened a marshal, but this was extreme even by his standards. He was fined 800 Swiss Francs (\u00a3400) and thrown off the race, which meant he was unable to support Nozal in his hour of need. \"This is particularly serious as the whole world was able to hear Mr Saiz's threats and insults,\" said the race's disciplinary officer, Jean-Michel Voets. Saiz may face an extended ban, but his future is unclear in other ways. He has yet to announce a replacement sponsor for ONCE who are pulling out after 13 seasons. Real Madrid have been mentioned as a possibility but the weekend's events may have lessened any chance of a tie-up with Beckham et al."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
