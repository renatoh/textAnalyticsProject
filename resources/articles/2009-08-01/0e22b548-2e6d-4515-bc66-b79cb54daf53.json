I am a 47-year-old graduate with an income of \u00a35,000 a year before tax, an annual carer's allowance of \u00a32,600, and net dividend income of \u00a313,000 from an Isa account of \u00a3300,000. I have no debt. Obviously, I wish to have my cake and eat it, capitalising on any stockmarket rises but also not throwing money down the drain by renting. Is this possible? DN A Yes, lenders are willing to offer mortgages based on a mixture of incomes. However, they do like predictability so are less keen to lend against an income which is likely to fluctuate. So it is highly unlikely you will find a lender willing to take your net dividend income of \u00a313,000 into account when assessing your mortgage application. If you want to buy somewhere I suspect you are going to have to use some of the capital from your Isa. This may not be the hardship you seem to think it is, however, because what you would lose in terms of dividend income you will gain in not having to pay mortgage interest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
