Described by the Guardian\u2019s Mike McCahill as a film to \u201cbreak your heart and sear your soul\u201d, For Sama is a chronicle filmed by Syrian activist-director al-Kateab as Aleppo is targeted during the country\u2019s ongoing civil war. Al-Kateab spends much of the time in a hospital where her husband, Hamza, works, recording the destruction and horror. For Sama won a total of four Bifas, including best editing \u2013 previously announced with other Bifa \u201ccraft\u201d awards on 15 November. The Personal History of David Copperfield, adapted from the Dickens novel by Armando Iannucci, had led the nominations count with 11, and ended up with five: three previously announced (best casting, costume design and production design), plus best supporting actor for Hugh Laurie as Mr Dick, and best screenplay for Iannucci and Simon Blackwell. However, David Copperfield\u2019s Dev Patel, who was arguably the favourite, lost out as best actor to Josh O\u2019Connor for the infertility drama Only You. O\u2019Connor has now won the award twice in three years, having taken it in 2017 for God\u2019s Own Country. Best actress went to Ren\u00e9e Zellweger for her role as Judy Garland in Judy, the biopic of the troubled movie star. Only You went on to win a second award on the night: best debut director for Harry Wootliff. The Last Tree, the autobiographical fable from director Shola Amoo, also won two awards, for best supporting actress for Ruthxjiah Bellenea and most promising newcomer for its lead Sam Adewunmi. Bait, the Cornwall-set drama filmed in black and white, won best breakthrough producers for Kate Byers and Linn Waite.
