But are they all in it together at the BBC?", "bodyText": "\u2022 Searing truth-telling after a bruising few weeks at the state broadcaster. \"As a BBC journalist, I should really be capable of writing analytical and in-depth prose,\" says The World Tonight's Paul Moss, baring his soul to the house journal Ariel. \"But I am sitting here thinking of the BBC management who took all that money meant for programme-making and instead lavished it on each other's farewell handouts. And I'm thinking of how we have all been left to scrimp and save to fund the work we do, and how the BBC's reputation has plummeted in the wake of the pay-out revelations. And I find myself unable to write anything except 'B*****d, b*****d, b*****d, b*****d, b******s'.\" They learn to keep the scripts simple. \u2022 But no wonder they're cross. Lots of money sloshing around, but precious little of it in the newsrooms up and down the country. Seems easier to shake the BBC money tree from the top. That's why, when two or three staffers are gathered, they take to wondering why the fearless Margaret Hodge \u2013 famously parsimonious chair of the public accounts select committee \u2013 has yet to pass gaze on the issue of BBC creative director Alan Yentob and his mooted mega pension? Yentob has been at the Beeb for 45 years, accumulating that pension pot of gold, and is now beyond the corporation retirement age of 65. Last month it emerged that Yentob is paid twice: \u00a3183,300 a year as creative director, and another goodly sum to present the arts strand Imagine. The BBC keeps the latter a secret on \"commercial\" grounds. Happy days for some; hangdog, groundhog days for others. Will Two Jobs retire on two pensions too? \u2022 We're not invited but a glittering, warm event occurs at Soho's Gay Hussar restaurant on the occasion of the 82nd birthday of that Labour warhorse Illtyd Harrington, Ken Livingstone's deputy at the Thatcher-baiting GLC. In keeping with his history and political preferences, many figures from the Labour left in London are there; also friends such as the photographer Nobby Clark, Elton John's former manager John Reid, and the celebrated QC Gavin Millar. The mood is convivial. And then in strides Mandelson. \"It was fascinating to watch,\" says Illtyd. \"He arrived on his fold-up bike and initially it seemed that quite a few noses were out of joint from those who don't much like him, but he was such a charmer. He spoke to everyone; signed autographs. I was impressed with the way he lit up the room.\" They talked at length. \"In the next three or four years, I think Peter will come back into the mainstream,\" says Illtyd. And his advice? \"I reminded him that life is about being human; not king of the world.\" \u2022 Yes, Mandy is definitely making nice. Yesterday Labour party members received a missive from Mandelson himself, trying to help raise a few bob for the grassroots network LabourList. \"I might not agree with everything that's written on LabourList \u2013 and I'm sure you don't either \u2013 but we need LabourList to encourage a healthy debate about our future,\" he says, addressing recipients as \"Dear comrade, oops, colleague.\" He's a fighter and a quipper. We shall be watching him. \u2022 And we are hearing more and more from Lord Deben, the former Tory minister, who apparently lives to stick it to the Tories. Last week it was a broadside against those who can't live with gay marriage and the coalition's poor show in abstaining on an important environmental measure in Brussels. Now, emboldened and unabashed, he tells the Lords that the government's policy towards a new waste tunnel under the Thames is out of date. He can't be stopped. He's landing almost as many blows as some of Labour's frontbench. \u2022 Finally, the royal baby brings joy in the most unlikely places. At the Libertarian Alliance, the leader Sean Gabb is poetically over the moon. He writes: \"Praise be to Balding Billy, Whose heir will have a willy, Which, thank God, will surely mean, Not another bloody Queen.\" Forward thinking in short supply at Libertarian HQ.
