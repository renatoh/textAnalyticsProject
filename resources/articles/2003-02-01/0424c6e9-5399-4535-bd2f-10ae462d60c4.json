This particular lurch was not on the old timetable, but it was essential to complete it quickly while IDS still basking in unprecedented popularity. The new chief executive of the Conservative party, Barry Legg, will announce IDS's decision to box Michael Portillo for Comic Relief. March 12: With Portillo still licking his wounds in hospital, Theresa May can now be safely released. John Redwood becomes temporary party leader as IDS leads special Tory mercenary force into Iraq, while Blair and Bush dither. April 1: Redwood's Commons April Fool's prank makes Blair look humourless and girly. Details still to be worked out, but we can count on John's impeccable comic timing. April 13: IDS returns from Iraq in triumph on Palm Sunday. The parade permits are already pending. It's been suggested that IDS could ride down the Embankment on a donkey, but many felt the symbolism would be a bit heavy-handed, and prone to backfire. Anyway, the tank has already been hired. May 1: Local election triumph. Vindication for IDS proposals to cut excessive NHS funding. Big poll bounce. June 23: Lurch back to the centre. By now we've just about caught up to the old timetable. Legg, David Davis et al defect to UKIP as planned, paving the way for Oliver Letwin's new hairstyle. IDS resumes \"Quiet Man\" mode to allow poll numbers to mature and ripen. His usefulness outlived, Redwood is reabsorbed into the Borg. July 4: Portillo, still walking with a cane, makes a rare public appearance to endorse IDS fully. We will need sharpshooters on all the adjacent roofs in case he goes off-message, but let's sort that out nearer the time. August 29: Announce lurch toward Europe. Don't worry, it's only a feint. September 3: Lurch back, collect poll winnings. October 5: Party conference. Announcement that William Hague is to be brought back into shadow cabinet to inject much-needed glamour. They'll stop laughing when they see his beard! November 1- January 31: Complete silence - designed to unsettle the opposition. February 3: IDS announces new range of policies: war on France, dismantling of public transport system, etc. The corresponding sharp drop in the polls will trick Blair into calling early election. Sacking Hague restores poll numbers. Final lurch to right in tune with public mood. May 1: General election triumph. Now it's donkey time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
