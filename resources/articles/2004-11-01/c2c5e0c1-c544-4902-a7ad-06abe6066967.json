The revolutionary technology, that will take you on a three and a half-minute virtual tour of Egypt, is being introduced in a Lunn Poly shop in Leeds before being rolled out by parent company Thomson to branches nationwide in January. The film's 3D surround vision, sound and smells will be accessed through a special headset worn by the customer in the travel agency, a pioneering example of the technology promising to change the face of high street holiday sales over coming years. \"This is a real taste of how holidays could be sold in the future,\" said Miles Morgan, Thomson's sales and marketing director. \"It's the first time any travel company has created technology of this kind and it allows customers to try before they buy. We'll be looking to expand the technology next year. Our plan is to work with different tourist boards to help fund the project so we can offer a wide range of destinations over the next 12 months.\" * Thomson is rebranding all Lunn Poly outlets as Thomson Holiday Shops next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
