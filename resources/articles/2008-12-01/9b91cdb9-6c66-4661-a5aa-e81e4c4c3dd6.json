As the Cuban revolution approaches the eve of its 50th birthday, there is still life in this most consummate of politicians. Se\u00f1or Castro, far from dead, is penning his thoughts to his nation by way of his state newspaper, Granma. In last Friday's edition in La Habana, he set out his reflections on the new phenomenon that is Barack Obama. For all the street signs and propaganda colouring Cuban roads with catchphrases about the imminent anniversary festivities, Castro's printed words might yet be a sobering staccato for those of us who have been jumping with glee at the thought of regime change in the White House. In an article entitled \"Sailing against the tide\", Fidel Castro reminds us that Obama gave a pre-election speech to the Cuban-American National Foundation in May, saying that he would continue the blockade that has destroyed the capacity of this country for three generations. Furthermore, the blockade has served no lawful purpose other than an unsuccessful attempt to destabilise the Castro regime. Obama's new secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, will need little reminder that it was her husband who sanctioned the Helms-Burton Act that tightened the blockade against Cuba in 1996. This legislation was invoked by Bush to keep his country's mortal enemy at bay after September 11. The clear implication in Castro's article is that Obama's policy on Cuba must be tightly monitored. Faced with this reminder of the limits of his power to change unpopular policy against stiff opposition, Obama would be wise to recall the words of one Ernesto Che Guevara. Guevara once thanked, sardonically, Joseph McCarthy for the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1963, noting that there is nothing like an American-backed invasion to unite a country gripped with the aftermath of a revolution. Those acerbic words were met with riotous applause by a knowledgeable and excited Habanero public last night, at the premiere screening of Steven Soderbergh's epic biopic, Che. The stars were out in force, including Benicio del Toro, who was clearly overwhelmed by the mass mobbing for photographs as he sat down, compa\u00f1ero-style, among members of the public in the eponymous Yara cinema, in the once-swanky Vedado quarter in the centre of La Habana. If the film does not glorify the revolutionary legend, then it certainly gives the story, and the man himself, a clear voice. Many Cubans are somewhat ashamed that this film was not created by one of their own, but it received spontaneous applause at moments which would have passed over the heads of most foreigners. The depiction of Ra\u00fal Castro in the first part of the film received many laughs, and the phlegmatic Fidel Castro himself was the subject of belly-gripping hilarity whenever he referred to a plan or his thoughts about the future. An astonishingly life-like Che was greeted with adulation from an audience that was mostly too young to remember him. What would be remarkable to an American audience, perhaps, is that there were no rallying cries of \"Patria o Muerte\", and no patriotic stamping or cheering when Castro spoke about the longevity of his revolution. There is barely any energy left here for that. By contrast to the interaction of the crowd for part one of the film, however, the second part of the film, set in Bolivia and leading to Che's death, left a usually noisy audience deflated, silent and morose. The film has people talking in Cuba, and while Che is a figure loved by almost all, the vision of a future which he helped to create is not shared by everyone. Those who desire change in Cuba, both inside and outside of the island, must begin to understand the complex emotions of a public that does not want to be American, but does want to belong to a global community. Real thought needs to be employed, not just by Cuban-Americans in Miami who are keen to bring their Florida dollars back home to Cuba, but by others who want don't McDonalds and Starbucks creating universal eyesores on the best real estate; therefore allowing Cuba to remain a truly individual, vibrant culture in control of its own future. It is thinking about the future that Fidel has somehow done best. Fidel always understood the power of hyperbole, unity and nationalism. He employed it to create a country which, weary both from sanctions and from its global isolation, is nevertheless rightfully proud of its extraordinary achievements. Make no mistake, however; this is a totalitarian regime, and the streets are alive with signs glorifying the 50th anniversary of the revolution at the end of this month. There are no democratic elections, and restrictions remain on people's freedom. There is, however, education, food, culture and excellent medical provision. Nor is there widespread and systemic brutal repression in the streets which are alive with life and determination. Cuba is not a banana republic, and this is not a country that deserves to be treated with arrogant first-world contempt. It has been 50 years since Guevara stormed the university city of Santa Clara and his band of rugged cigar-smoking men upturned a US-backed army. Guevara was killed 40 year ago, and since that time there has not been a Cuban figure who has inspired as many universal dreams of change. In a global era seemingly no longer suited to the triumphs and tribulations of an idealistic vision that Guevara and his followers once enjoyed, the international hysteria that surrounds Obama's victory must be viewed as extraordinary in itself. But, the hysteria must devolve quickly into rational and considered policy. There is no reason left \u2013 if there ever was \u2013 for the US to continue to pursue its ill-considered and vengeful acts of blockade. As a lawyer, Obama, must consider the legal implications and consequences of a Cuban blockade. As a world leader, Obama must use his power to rectify old mistakes that continue to have a haunting, destructive presence on ordinary people. After all, there is nothing like an American-backed attack to unite a 20th-century country dragged down by 21st-century spite."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
