But at least there's Vinnie Jones as Dinklage, the footie coach, to wonder at. Good Will Hunting 9pm, Film4 (Gus Van Sant, 1997) The film that showed hot young actors Matt \"Jason Bourne\" Damon and Ben Affleck were not just pretty faces. They scripted this well-crafted drama about Damon's Will Hunting, a university janitor-come-maths whiz who is brighter than the students. He has to learn to trust himself and others, such as Oscar-winning Robin Williams's volatile shrink. Poseidon 11.10pm, Sky Movies Action Thriller (Wolfgang Petersen, 2006) Petersen, director of Das Boot and The Perfect Storm, sets sail again with this relaunch of The Poseidon Adventure, a tale of a cruise liner capsized by a rogue wave from the biggest special-effects computer available. Kurt Russell replaces the Rev Gene Hackman as leader of the survivors in an action-laden, character-lite disaster movie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
