But few boxers can have battled with such ferocity simply to win the right to earn a living by stepping into the ring. And when the 32-year-old, Irishman takes on South Africa's Johannes Maisa at York Hall, Bethnal Green, in London's East End tonight, there will at last be visible evidence that McCullough's campaign to regain his British Boxing Board of Control fighter's licence has been a success. It was two years ago, while preparing for a fight in Belfast, that the former World Boxing Council world super bantamweight title holder failed a routine brain scan and was told a one-centimetre wide cyst was lodged between his brain and his skull and the cause of the abnormality, his boxing licence, would be suspended. Not surprisingly, when faced with a ruling which would end his career, McCullough sought a second opinion. The advice he received was encouraging and, with the support of his wife and manager Cheryl, McCullough set about compiling a dossier of medical evidence to prove that the cyst was not dangerous and probably not caused by boxing. \"I lost count of how much this has cost me. It runs into thousands and thousands of dollars. I visited 14 of the most eminent neurosurgeons in the world,\" says McCullough. \"When you are faced with something like that, money isn't the issue. You just want to prove to yourself that you are well. \"In any case the money I spent is nothing compared to what I might have earned in the ring over the two years. I was looking for another world title shot, against the WBC super bantamweight champion Willie Jorrin, and I believe I would have won. \"With a couple of defences I could have made over a million dollars and been able to say I had accomplished everything I wanted from boxing, and to be able to think about retirement. But not now.\" McCullough could be forgiven for feeling bitter, particularly about the initial intransigence of the British board who refused to renew his licence, even though the influential Nevada State Athletic Commission concluded there was no medical reason why he should not fight. However, he is determined not to dwell on the past and returned to the ring in January in Las Vegas, knocking out Alvin Brown in two rounds, only to receive another setback when his long-time promoters America Presents ran into financial problems. But now, after signing a promotional deal with Frank Warren, McCullough finds himself able to box in Britain after the board of control relented and issued a licence when it was made aware that its policy of denying McCullough the right to box would be unlikely to stand up in court. Nevertheless two doctors on the board's medical advisory panel resigned over the affair, including the Belfast general practitioner George O'Neill, who refused to discuss it this week, hiding behind \"the strict confidentiality between doctor and patient\". \"That's rubbish,\" said McCullough. \"I have the world's finest specialists saying I am fit to fight and a couple of GPs think they know more and choose to quit. One of them said I was brain-damaged. It's unbelievable and absolutely not the case. I have a professor of neurosurgery from Los Angeles University, one of the best men in the United States, and the board's own consultant Peter Richards saying that I am fit. I would not be back in the ring if I thought I was putting myself at risk, especially with a wife and family to think of.\" Despite the cost of the fight for his licence, McCullough is not continuing for money. A comfortable lifestyle in Las Vegas shows how well he has earned from the sport. Rather more, McCullough has a point to prove in the sport which has been his life since he turned professional after winning the Olympic bantamweight silver medal in Barcelona in 1992. \"Frank Warren has said he can get me a fight for the world featherweight title. But I believe I could win Willie Jorrin's world title as a super bantam. I feel fit and sharp. \"After that I want to go for Marco Antonio Barrera. I have always fought the best and everybody says he is the best featherweight in the world since he beat Erik Morales and Naseem Hamed. \"I will know when the time is right for me to get out of the sport but there are some big fights still in me. Two years ago my whole world was caving in. Now I have the chance to get out on my terms.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
