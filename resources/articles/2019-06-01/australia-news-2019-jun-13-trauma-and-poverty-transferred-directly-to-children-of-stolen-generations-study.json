The Australian Institute for Health and Welfare (AIHW) has found that compared with other Indigenous children, children in households with members of the stolen generations were significantly more likely to: have missed school without permission in the last 12 months live in a home not owned by a family member report having been treated unfairly at school for being Indigenous have experienced stress in the last 12 months live in a household that had cash-flow problems in the last 12 months have poor self-assessed health The AIHW report found that in 2014\u201315 there were almost 8,000 Indigenous children aged 0\u201314 who lived in the same household with a stolen generations family member, about 3% of all Indigenous children in that age group. \u201cThe data in the latest AIHW report provides a genuine evidence base that proves Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children living in households with members or descendants of the stolen generations experience greater levels of social and economic disadvantage,\u201d CEO of the Healing Foundation, Richard Weston, said. \u201cIt uncovers direct evidence of intergenerational trauma being passed down through the generations and still impacting today\u2019s younger generation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids,\u201d Weston said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are members of the stolen generations \u2013 people who were forcibly removed from their families as a result of government policies across Australian jurisdictions \u2013 are recognised as experiencing worse outcomes in a range of areas, including health, socioeconomic, justice and housing, compared with other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who were not removed from their families. The AIHW examined 20 selected outcomes for children over five areas, including health, life stressors, school attendance, language and culture, and some household measures. It is the first time children included in these surveys have been connected to adults in the same household who were removed from their families, to uncover direct evidence of the intergenerational effects of removal. In general, children living in these households were more likely to experience a range of adverse outcomes than other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
