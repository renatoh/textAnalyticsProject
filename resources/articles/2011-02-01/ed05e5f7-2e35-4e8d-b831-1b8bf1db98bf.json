The Scottish nationalists built an alliance with the Conservatives and Lib Dems to vote through their \u00a329bn budget by a 31-vote margin. Labour was left as the only major party to oppose the package, claiming the government had used a \"slush fund\" to buy opposition votes. The co-operation between the three parties allowed Labour to accuse Salmond's administration of passing on \u00a31.3bn worth of cuts engineered by the UK government, with three months to go before the Holyrood elections. Labour rejected concessions from John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, to fund another 1,500 apprenticeship places and increase spending on housing and student bursaries. Andy Kerr, Labour's finance spokesman, said: \"The SNP are implementing over \u00a31bn of Tory cuts with the heaviest blows falling in areas that drive growth and create jobs, such as higher education, enterprise and regeneration.\" He added: \"It is our duty to say that it is not good enough for Scotland. Scotland does deserve better. And in twelve weeks time Scotland will have the choice of a better government.\" His claims brought a furious rebuff from Swinney, who accused Labour of \"utter hypocrisy\". He said Labour was attacking his budget for failing to include policies which it had not asked him to consider. \"Every single thing I was asked by the Labour party to deliver, I offered to the Labour party,\" he said. The clearest winners from the horse-trading were the Lib Dems, who extracted a \u00a323m package to increase bursaries for poor students and fund more college places, which helped to restore their battered reputation among students at a critical time for the party. The Lib Dems have seen their support in Scotland slump as low as 7% in opinion polls. Private polling by other parties has suggested the Lib Dems could lose up to six of their 16 seats at Holyrood in the election in May; the Lib Dems admit the polls are depressing but insist they consistently underestimate their actual performance in elections. The bursaries package for mature students, worth \u00a315m, won applause from the National Union of Students Scotland, which has been furiously critical of the tuition fee increases introduced by the Lib Dem-Tory coalition in London. Despite the party's role in pushing through higher tuition fees at Westminster, Liam Burns, the NUS Scotland president, was quoted in a Lib Dem press release applauding its success in securing the additional funding. He said 40,000 adult students would benefit. \"This is great news and testament to the hard work of thousands of college students across Scotland and the Scottish Liberal Democrats,\" Burns said. But Hugh Henry, a former Labour education minister, said the Lib Dems were \"kidding themselves\" if they believed that students would be persuaded to vote for them. \"They will not forget their betrayal in a hurry,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
