In whatever time he has left Haye hopes to challenge the winner of Anthony Joshua and Wladimir Klitschko, who meet in April, then his old sparring partner, Deontay Wilder, who held on to his WBC title with a fifth-round stoppage of the rightly unheralded former tennis player and failed college footballer, Gerald Washington, in Alabama at the weekend. It was a dreadful fight with a predictable ending. There is little that is predictable about Haye so, if there is an echo in the room, it might be ringing through from 2012, when he vowed with conviction that he would quit the sport on his 31st birthday. He turned 36 last October. \u201cI believe I can achieve what I need to achieve before my 38th birthday but I don\u2019t want to put a timer on it, a date on it,\u201d he says. \u201cI did that from when I got into the boxing ring as a kid. When I first went to Fitzroy Lodge, I said I was going to be heavyweight champion of the world and retire when I was 30. This is when I was 10. I came real close. I rushed to get that fight with Klitschko [in 2011] before my 31st birthday because I really wanted to achieve everything. That was always the plan. That was going to be my last fight.\u201d But Haye\u2019s big toe famously gave up on him that night and he has had to ride the derision ever since in a stuttering comeback. Bellew would like to put a definitive full stop on Haye\u2019s career and, in another animated but thankfully incident-free press conference in his home city of Liverpool on Monday, the world cruiserweight champion left his opponent in no doubt he will carry the fight to him for as long as he is standing. Bellew and his trainer, Dave Coldwell [who once was in the Haye camp], believe the damage to Haye\u2019s right shoulder that caused him to pull out of two fights with Tyson Fury and required surgery, will haunt him the longer the fight goes. Haye, naturally, does not think so. \u201cI need to warm it up every day,\u201d he admits, \u201cstuff I should have done before it was injured. I do loads of stuff in my left arm that I never used to do because of having the injured right shoulder, it has allowed me to realise that I don\u2019t want this one to go. I believe my right shoulder is better now than it was before. I\u2019ve built all the muscles up around it so it is stronger, it is more solid. That was a worry at first. When I started sparring, the timing was out a little bit, obviously, but, since I started landing, since the timing is back, it feels as good as it ever has done.\u201d Haye reckons he has the most concussive single-punch power in boxing. \u201cI\u2019ve got no question of that. My punching power passes any other heavyweight,\u201d he says. \u201cOne punch, two punch, however you want to tally it up. I definitely believe if you give me any part of your chin, you are going to sleep.\u201d Physically, if not verbally, Haye is more imposing. He is a cut monster who will probably still come in under 17st. Bellew, who has always taken pride in his rounded appearance and enjoys life away from the gym, will definitely be in deficit. Haye, one of the few vegans in boxing, says: \u201cPeople say, \u2018Where do you get your strength from?\u2019 Well, where does an ape get his strength from? They are 20 times stronger than humans and they don\u2019t rely on a meat-based diet. They eat plants all day long. It\u2019s a myth that you need meat for strength. \u201cIf you strip off all the body fat, Bellew would still be a light-heavyweight. If you strip off the body fat from me, I\u2019d be exactly what I am today: that\u2019s the difference. When you see me on the scales on Friday, you\u2019re going to see a very close resemblance to the day I stepped on the scales nearly nine years to the day against Enzo Maccarinelli, in 2008.\u201d Haye has been turning back the clock for years now. Bellew, five years younger, hopes the Londoner has mistimed his latest calculations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
