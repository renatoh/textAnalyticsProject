The Brexit party leader gave a series of long interviews between 2011 and 2016 to Rick Wiles, who has long used his TruNews broadcasting network to spread conspiracy theories, including the idea that Barack Obama is a Muslim plotting against the US. In the interviews, unearthed by the anti-racist group Hope Not Hate, Farage repeatedly discussed a supposed plot by bankers and \u201cglobalists\u201d to impose a world government, a conspiracy theory strongly linked to antisemitism. Farage has previously been condemned by leading Jewish groups in the UK for using such tropes in other interviews. The Brexit party has described criticisms as attempts to smear Farage. The discovery of the appearances on TruNews are likely to increase concerns about Farage\u2019s apparent willingness to discuss such ideas with far-right figures, particularly given the increasingly open nature of Wiles\u2019s antisemitism. In a TruNews broadcast last month, Wiles described Democrat attempts to impeach Trump as \u201ca Jew coup, plain and simple\u201d. Wiles continued: \u201cAmerica is in the throes of a political coup led by Jews. President Trump is surrounded by a rabid pack of seditious, treacherous Jews who are intent on overthrowing the votes of millions of Christians who elected him in 2016.\u201d While this was said more than three years after Farage\u2019s last appearance, during the five-year period of the interviews the evangelical broadcaster repeatedly used antisemitic tropes, spread other conspiracy theories and was openly racist. In one broadcast in 2015, Wiles said the US did not need gun control but \u201cMuslim control\u201d, saying the government should \u201cround up the Muslims and ship them out of this country\u201d. The same year, Wiles said the introduction of equal marriage could see the US destroyed by \u201ca fireball from space\u201d. In 2016, Wiles warned listeners that Obama was \u201ccoming into the schools to rape your children\u201d. Two months later he argued that the Pok\u00e9mon Go computer game was a Satanic plot to target churches with \u201cvirtual, digital, cyber demons\u201d. Antisemitic tropes were aired on TruNews episodes where Farage had appeared. In 2012, after Farage\u2019s interview was over, Wiles described George Soros, the financier often included in antisemitic conspiracy theories, as one of \u201cour society\u2019s biggest rodents\u201d. Transcripts of Farage\u2019s interviews show him seemingly willing to indulge Wiles in discussions of ideas often linked to the far right and antisemitism, notably the idea that bankers and other corporations are plotting to create a dictatorial global government. Speaking to Farage in February 2012 about the Greek debt crisis, Wiles asked him: \u201cAre we going to see some day the central bankers of the world install the prime minister of Great Britain; they\u2019re going to install a future president of the United States? Is this where we\u2019re going?\u201d Farage replied that \u201canything now is possible\u201d. In a 2011 discussion, the pair discussed supposed plots for world government by the Bilderberg group of political and industrial leaders, which commonly features in antisemitic conspiracy theories. Discussing the EU debt crisis, Wiles said: \u201cNigel, what do you think the Bilderberg boys [are] thinking throughout this? The EU is their little baby.\u201d Farage responded: \u201cOh, very much so. Of course, the Bilderberg group and the EU have been very close from the start.\u201d Matthew McGregor, campaigns director for Hope Not Hate, said Farage\u2019s links to Wiles \u201cunderlines just how dangerous and divisive the Brexit party is\u201d. He said: \u201cWiles has become even more vicious since the election of Donald Trump but his hate was always clear and unapologetic. Nigel Farage frequently appeared on Wiles\u2019s platform up until 2016 and was happy to legitimise and expound radical conspiracy theories, some with antisemitic associations, on an outlet that no mainstream politician should ever have countenanced. \u201cThis was not a one-off or unwitting mistake. This is an individual that Nigel Farage enthusiastically and repeatedly engaged with over several years. His disgraceful behaviour fits in with his wider pattern of collaboration with disreputable and dangerous conspiracy theorists.\u201d A spokesman for Farage said: \u201cNigel has done a huge amount of US radio, TV and media appearances over the last decade and more. If Mr Farage did appear on this radio show as the Guardian suggests, then he was certainly not aware of Mr Wiles\u2019s views.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
