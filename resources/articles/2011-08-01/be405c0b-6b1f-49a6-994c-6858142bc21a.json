Hampered by injury and lack of proper preparation, an impression in no way altered by the indolent manner in which they approached their match in Northampton last week, they have been roundly beaten not once but twice by a side who for the last year have been playing a very high-class game. The hope that India, as notoriously slow starters, would be stung into action by the match at Lord's proved a forlorn one and as they go to Edgbaston, the closest England have to a fortress and the most hostile ground to opposition, they do not even have that to fall back on. The England side of the Andrews, Flower and Strauss, understand to the full not just their strengths but also their limitations. They bat well, brilliantly at times, but not so well or consistently that they could compete, in theory anyway, with the stellar nature of India's top order. But then they know that the lower-order batting, unmatched in the game at the moment, can compensate. This is not arrogance but the sort of trust in one another forged in places as disparate as Melbourne and the Bavarian Alps. Likewise, the bowling attack would not claim to be capable of sitting on the summit of Mount Olympus with the bowling gods that sustained West Indies and Australia through their decades of dominance. But they are pretty damn good for all that, a resource so deep that a monster such as Chris Tremlett can be sidelined to no effect other than allowing someone else, Tim Bresnan, to step into the breach and play a blinder. In all probability, had Tremlett recovered from his twin ailments of hamstring strain and back spasm, Bresnan would have hung on to his place regardless. Cliche it may be but the real strength of the England team is in the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. England's priority is firmly on winning the series, which of course they cannot now lose. But beyond that is the strong probability that by the end of this match or the next they will have risen, over the course of little more than a decade, from the bottom of the ranking heap to the top, usurping India in the process. Disputatious the rankings may be but they do add a context to the game and offer something at which to aim. The chances are that over the next year or so there will be considerable flux at the top, for even if India surrender this series, they have a home series against West Indies in November, while England face a difficult time against Pakistan and Sri Lanka over the winter. Next summer's series against South Africa, scandalously only three Tests when it had been agreed only a couple of years ago that such meetings should be accorded five-Test status, may yet take on the same mantle of shoot-out for the top spot that precipitated the current matches. Happenstance has dictated that India's has been a greasy-pole selection where gains have been offset by losses. The absence of Virender Sehwag from the outset was a blow, as was the loss, early in the first match of Zaheer Khan, although that surely cannot just be put down to bad luck when he was so obviously underprepared. The blow on the elbow that forced Gautam Gambhir out of the second Test was unfortunate and now Harbhajan Singh and Yuvraj Singh have followed Zaheer home to recuperate. Sehwag returns to the side, as does Gambhir, which at least will give the Edgbaston crowd the full house of leading players to savour. But brilliant as he undoubtedly is, Sehwag has played only six of his 150 Test innings in England and none for the best part of a decade. England will be confident that the moving ball that India are certain to encounter can trouble him as much as it has everyone else. The England team have not emerged unscathed from Nottingham, with Jonathan Trott not recovering from the jarred shoulder received while fielding. Yet even from his misfortune came the emergence of Ian Bell at No3 to play quite possibly the most accomplished innings of his life. Bell will retain that spot on his home ground and it will be no surprise if he, black arm-banded to mark the death this week of Neal Abberley, did not dig deeper yet in his mentor's memory. So into the side comes Ravi Bopara, an international batsman of contrasts, with the sublime of hundreds in three successive Tests following the ridiculous of three noughts in succession. In 2009, when last he played, he was found out by Australia but England believe he has matured sufficiently to fill the role at No6, as well as augmenting the bowling. He follows Monty Panesar as a Sikh playing against India. The groundsman Steve Rouse \u2013 in his final Test this week \u2013 encountered early season problems balancing the moisture content of his pitches. That appears to be rectified and he has promised something with grass but perhaps slower than Lord's or Trent Bridge. If the ball swings then that will be an incidental. England must remain strong favourites."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
