In its latest incarnation, Mindmap produces dynamic maps that can include Microsoft Office files and Google search results. Mindjet has 200 staff at its base in San Francisco and offices in the UK, Germany and Japan, and is backed by 3i and Investor Growth Capital. Chief executive Scott Raskin takes us through it. Mindjet chief executive Scott Raskin \u2022 Explain your business to my Mum \"Mindjet provides productivity and collaboration software for visualising and managing information, which allows individuals to more effectively think, plan, collaborate and take action. Mindjet products enable users to visually connect and synthesise ideas and information to improve decision-making, shorten business planning processes, and harness the intellectual capital in their organisations.\" [My Mum says: It sounds very to-the-point for techno nerds. I think it's techno jargon.\"] \u2022 How do you make money? \"The sale of our software and online services.\" \u2022 What's your background? \"Prior to Mindjet, I was chief operating officer of another great company, Telelogic. At Telelogic, I led the company through several strategic acquisitions and extensive organic growth. Before joining Telelogic, I held senior marketing, sales and business management roles at Nexgenix, Bachman Information Systems and MAI Basic Four.\" \u2022 Are we in the middle of a new dot com bubble? \"Not from my perspective. We are not seeing high growth in valuations and if anything, tech companies are potentially undervalued. A market bubble is a self-perpetuating rise based on speculation. When speculators recognise the fast increase and buy in anticipation of higher prices, a bubble occurs as companies become overvalued and then boom, the bubble bursts.\" \u2022 How many users do you have now, and what's your target within 12 months? \"We have over 1.4 million users and are growing daily.\" \u2022 Which tech businesses or web thinkers are the ones to watch? \"Charles Leadbeater, journalist and author and a leading authority on innovation and creativity, recently came out with a book called We-think which I really identified with. It's about the power of mass creativity, which charts the rise of participative approaches to innovation from science and open source software, to computer games and political campaigning. \"Tim O'Reilly, who is considered the father of the term Web 2.0. Tim is founder and chief executive of O'Reilly Media, thought by many to be the best computer book publisher in the world, and I am always interested in his take on what's next.\" \u2022 What's your biggest challenge? \"Getting the word out.\" \u2022 Name your closest competitors \"Drawing products like Microsoft's Visio, collaboration products like WebEx and various project management applications.\" \u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years? \"Our goal is simple. We will continue to pursue our mission aggressively to revolutionise the way people work with information and each other to increase personal and team productivity.\" mindjet.com So what do you think about Mindjet's products?&lt; \u2022 Mindjet has already survived one tech crash - can it survive this one? \u2022 Wouldn't this software be more effective online than on the desktop? \u2022 And have you actually tried mind mapping? Does it really work?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
