The animals \u2013 11 orcas and 87 beluga whales \u2013 have been held in captivity in a bay near the port city of Nakhodka since last year. They were due to be sold to Chinese oceanariums, before images of the animals languishing in the \u201cwhale prison\u201d caused an international outcry. Vladimir Putin last week hailed Russia\u2019s moves to return the whales to the wild. However, Greenpeace Russia said the two orcas and six beluga whales were simply dumped into the Sea of Okhotsk on Thursday after being transported 1,100 miles by truck and then boat to their natural habitat. The journey took seven days and the whales were held in small containers the entire time. The decision to free the animals came after a visit to their pens in April by Jean-Michel Cousteau, an oceanographer and son of the late marine expert Jacques Cousteau. Yet despite promises by Russian officials that Cousteau\u2019s team of maritime experts would be involved in their release, no international or independent scientists were invited to take part. Cousteau had recommended that the whales be transported only by sea. Greenpeace said no attempt was made to prepare the whales for their return to the wild, seriously raising the risk of trauma or death for the animals. It also said that the entire operation was carried out in secrecy. \u201cIt\u2019s cruel to release orcs and beluga whales who have spent seven days in these containers straight into the sea,\u201d Oganes Targulyan, a Greenpeace expert, told Russian media. \u201cThey weren\u2019t released, but dumped [into the sea].\u201d Russian officials said the operation had been successful, and that none of the whales suffered during the journey. Nine orcas and 81 beluga whales remain in captivity. They will be freed in batches over the next four months. A court in Russia\u2019s far east this month ordered a number of companies to pay fines totaling 150.2m roubles (\u00a31.8m) for their roles in the \u201cwhale prison\u201d. But according to documents published on Russia\u2019s state procurement website, the same companies were also hired by the state fisheries and oceanography institute to release the whales. They stand to earn more than 360m roubles in total."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
