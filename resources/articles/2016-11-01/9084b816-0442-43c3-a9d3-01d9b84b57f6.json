The last thing the Lions need, he said, is any extra attention. So if his words were spun into gaudy stories and sensational headlines, he would simply stop talking to the press. Then, with his very next breath, Gatland explained that some of the All Blacks\u2019 fans were so arrogant that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by their behaviour, a remark which seems unlikely to go down all that well back in New Zealand. Perhaps it was all part of the Lions head coach\u2019s elaborate plan to get himself out of the endless cycle of commercial engagements. Gatland was at Eden Park for the All Blacks\u2019 last Bledisloe Cup match against Australia last month. \u201cAs a Kiwi, I was embarrassed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was still a large portion of the crowd booing [Australia\u2019s] Quade Cooper. Get over it.\u201d Cooper has been a pantomime villain in New Zealand since he shoved Richie McCaw in a match in Hong Kong in 2010. In another game, the next year, he caught McCaw in the head with a knee. Despite all that, McCaw himself has described Cooper as a \u201cdecent bloke\u201d\u201a and Beauden Barrett echoed his words last month when he called Cooper \u201ca good bloke who deserves to be treated just like anyone else\u201d. Gatland, who played 17 non-international matches for New Zealand without appearing in a Test, said: \u201cOne of the things I was proud of as a Kiwi was showing humility. The All Blacks try to do that but there\u2019s a proportion of New Zealanders that have a little bit of arrogance and not humility. It was the first time that I\u2019ve sat there and thought: \u2018We\u2019re better than this.\u2019\u201d It was not just the boos that bothered Gatland. He was also unimpressed by a cartoon on the front cover of the New Zealand Herald\u2019s sport section which showed Australia\u2019s head coach, Michael Cheika, dressed as a clown. The Wallabies captain, Stephen Moore, said at the time that he thought the cartoon was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d. Gatland seemed to agree with him. \u201cYou can be proud but you\u2019ve still got to show humility and respect,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past New Zealanders have prided ourselves on that and been humble about the success of the rugby team.\u201d Gatland was keen to stress it was just a number of the fans who he feels were in the wrong, rather than the team themselves, despite the spat between Cheika and the All Blacks\u2019 head coach, Steve Hansen. \u201cObviously there\u2019s history between Steve Hansen and Cheika that\u2019s come out on a few occasions, but the squad and team have tried to play things down,\u201d he said. The 53-year-old insisted he is not so worried about how those same fans will treat the Lions next summer, however. \u201cI think it\u2019s just something that\u2019s between Australia and New Zealand.\u201d The New Zealanders, Gatland went on to say, have fond memories of the Lions\u2019 fans from their last tour in 2005. In fact he thinks they also learned a thing or two about how to behave. \u201cOne of the things the Lions fans taught the New Zealand public was how to support a team even when they weren\u2019t going well. The Kiwis aren\u2019t good at that, when the team\u2019s losing we\u2019re not good supporters. But the Lions fans were.\u201d Gatland is hoping that this time round the Lions fans may get to teach the Kiwis a little something about how to be gracious in victory too.
