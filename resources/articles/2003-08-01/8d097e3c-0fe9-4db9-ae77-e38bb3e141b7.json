You will never fully fathom it...'", "bodyText": "DH: I'm Dan Hawkins, guitarist for The Darkness. JH: I'm Justin from The Darkness, singer and lead guitar player. FP: I'm Frankie (Pouillan). EG: I'm Ed (Graham), I play the drums. Hello. I'm goin the bar, whatcha all drinkin'? From Tommy P DH: No Tommy, let me buy you a drink. You've been a keen supporter of the band for many years. JH: Tommy, have whatever you want but don't make it a double, that's taking the piss. EG: I'll have a large gin and tonic. JH: Sambucca with a Jegermeister top. DH: I'll have four drinks. One of each colour of Aftershock. FH: I'll have whatever you're having but quadruple it. I heard Justin deny the karaoke rumour on a radio show. Could he clear this up once and for all, as I would like to think that The Darkness didn't grow from such Pop Idol style leanings. From Jon Saunders JH: We are not competition winners! I did not sing karaoke! It is officially a lie! Yes, it was Millennium eve, my family was there and I just danced for them. I used my body to punctuate the lyrical content of that song (Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody). And it was good! DH: We just told the story in an interview and then it became \"How the band was started\". If you were dwarves in Snow White what would your names be? From Kati S DH: I have never even seen Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. FP: Sleazy. JH: Beastly. DH: Sushi. EG: Eddie. FP: Wankie? If you were a power chord, which one would you be, and who would you get to play it? From Gwilym Johnson FP: A bass chord played by none other than Lemmy. DH: An E 7th played by Shania Twain. The chord of love. JH: Major 7th? That's not a power chord. DH: Well just an E power chord then, by Shania Twain. JH: (to EG) What drum would you be? FP: Meg White hitting you with a magic wand? DG: A timpani being hit by Phil Collins. Who would be in your ultimate super cock-rock band? From Dominic JH: Tommy Lee on drums, Brian May doing rhythm guitar for the odd duel solo, Steve Tyler singing. And Mark King from Level 42 on bass. DH: We all agree on that. JH: And Enya? Why are you so cool? From Fanos JH: If you had gone to school with me that question would not have come up. We are anything but cool. Sure we are cool now, but this time three years ago we were fucking losers. The world has changed around us. We are still the biggest twats you are likely to encounter, but for some reason that is all the rage now. Being uncool is the new cool. FP: It's because we're being ourselves and keeping it real. DH: We were quite naturally twats for a long time but now we are considered cool for some reason. JH: It is people like you Fanos just making us cool. Cooool as. What do you argue about on tour? From Stephen Morley All: Alcohol. FP: Rationing, provision, distribution... JH: The practicalities and the emotional reactions. EG: Retribution, refrigeration and lack of contribution. JH: And abuse. DH: Aftershock was a standard drink for a while then it got banned from touring. JH: Basically I got upset with Ed on Aftershock and pulled a button off his coat and refused to sew it back on and then it was banned. EG: Wanker. That coat is still ruined. It is safety-pinned on. JH: Don't go on about it. Were you influenced by Spinal Tap? From Freddie Auld JH: Spinal Tap is funny because it is true. Everyone wants to be in a band because that means you don't have to be a 'good person' who has a grasp on responsibility. It is an escape, and in that environment stuff like what happens to Spinal Tap happens to us. Sometimes. The music is funny, but we are in no way influenced by their music. FP: Freddie, I have one thing to say to you. Hell is an inability to comprehend The Darkness. JH: The Darkness is like a sweet lady woman. You will never fully fathom it, and after a while you will stop trying because you love no other woman. The Darkness have a reputation for being a great group to see live. What are the best live performances by other acts that each of you has seen? From Barbara DH: AC/DC at Wembley 2001 Stiff Upper Lip Tour. JH: Thunder at the UEA, 1991. EG: Killing Joke at the Camden Underworld last week. FP: The Queens of the Stone Age tickled my fancy. For once the hype fits the band - they are good. JH: The worst one I've seen was Bon Jovi at Hyde Park - a colossal waste of time. They sound like the music off Ally McBeal. \"You know you make me wanna...ooh come on everyone!\" It was like a barn dance without the barn. Rubbish. DH: They don't rock any more, but Def Leppard still do. EG: Saw the Rolling Stones the other weekend. They were good. FP: For puppets in gold chains, they were good. Gareth Gates or Will Young? From Karen Badger DH: Shoot 'em both. FP: Will Young is a tosspot but I think Gareth is OK. DH: Just because the public has an insight into 'the personality' or what someone is going through, it doesn't make it excusable for this shit to be in the charts. JH: I couldn't believe it when I found out Will Young is gay. Apparently that Dale Winton is bisexual as well. DH: Don't feel sorry for these people. It is all propaganda. You've surely got an eye on the USA - does America 'get' The Darkness? From AJ Thompson JH: America's got no choice because The Darkness is coming to get it! Do you need anyone to play maracas? From Emma Rodican-Jones JH: You can play my maracas anytime. I love a girl with a double-barrelled surname. What makes you laugh? From James Boston FP: Gurning. EG: Anything that's funny really. What is the nicest thing anyone has every said to you? From Luke Paul JH: \"You look much better in photographs\". DH: \"Dan you sexy thing, you looked great on stage tonight but then you always do. Love Natasha, Tory, Natalie.\" FP: \"Frankie you are a fucking cool pirate, thanks for the help with the hand-clapping.\" JH: \"I really admire you for not dealing with your teeth and leaving them the way that they are.\" Thanks, what's wrong with my teeth? DH: That's really sweet though. Especially when people give you little trinkets and stuff. A girl gave us all a crystal to protect us from evil, saying \"Nothing bad will happen to you if you wear this.\" They are the sweetest things. I've heard rumours that Frankie's half-brother is comedian Phil Kay? Is there any truth in this? From Ed Brewer FP: True he's my stepbrother. I told him Santa never existed and he was in floods of tears. He was very upset and settled into a downward spiral of narcissistic situationist comedy. JH: When I first met him we were trying to outdo each other on a balcony at a party. He ran two doors down and got on someone's exercise bike so I pissed off the balcony into the street below. You make up your own mind who won that battle. Where can I buy some purple hipsters? From J Dennis JH: Topshop. DH: Burtons Menswear. JH: What I suggest is buy some hipsters, bleach them and then dye them. DH: If you get enough beetroot you can dye your own white trousers and they will become purple. What about this rumour of a The Darkness tribute band? From El Penya JH: There's The Lightness and there's also The Daftness. They have a girl doing me because they didn't know anyone with a high enough voice. Imitation, the highest form of flattery. DH: Unless they are taking the piss. Do you think it's possible to be 'too hot'? Bands as hyped as you rarely seem to last From killjoys inc. FP: We are not hyped. JH: We weren't hyped for the first three years and we are still here. We were around before we were fashionable, we are around while we are fashionable and we'll still be around when we are not fashionable. DH: We will probably wait until we've got our fingers burnt before we learn the lesson. JH: Basically we are not going to fly too close to the sun. But fuck can we flap our wings. DH: Efficiency: minimum effort, maximum lift. JH: We're going to hit a thermal and go to the States. DH: We are an albatross. Albatross can fly across whole oceans. A solitary bird, like us, we are on our own, we are out there, we are on our own and fucking flying. Describe what it felt like opening Glastonbury this year? Did you hang around afterwards and if so, what did you do? From Stephanie M JH: It was brilliant. A real honour and a privilege opening it and we really put on a good show. It was brilliant - the amount of people who got up just to see us. Who gives you rock before breakfast? The Darkness. FP: A lot of bands could be thinking, \"This is sad being the first band on,\" but we make up the rules as we go along, we change people's perceptions. That's what we do. JH: It's all about the positive and the negative. Take what could be a shitty slot and make it something special. FP: Next year it's going to be a big thing, opening Glastonbury, and that's because of us. DH: The last thing we did after 12 hours of promotion and drinking was a TV interview. JH: It was like boozy Tourette's. DH: It ended up with Colin Murray saying: \"Shut it!\" I am a genie and I grant you three wishes, but they must involve leather. From BigDave JH: A leather house. You just need to give it a polish and a bit of dubbin ever now and then, a leather car and a gimp mask. EG: A leather jacket, a three-piece suite sofa and some leather shoes. What is the most rock 'n' roll thing you have done this week? From RightSaidFred JH: We threw peanuts at a waiter in club class of the ferry. DH: We got upgraded to club class, drank loads of champagne then got told off for swearing because there was a family nearby. ... and what's the least rock'n'roll thing you've done this week? DH: We said sorry for our language. What's your favourite AC/DC album? From Dunc5 JH: Power Rage. DH: Back in Black. EG: The Best Of. What's your favourite non-rock album? From KJ DH: Abba, Arrival. EG: Talk Talk, Spirit of Eden. FP: Nick Cave, Tender Prey. I wouldn't say that's rock, at least not with a capital R. JH: I don't really listen to non-rock. Run DMC, Raising Hell, because it's got Aerosmith on it. When you supported Robbie Williams at Knebworth what was he like? From Adam Jeffes JH: I went to say thanks because it was a great opportunity for us and I think we delivered. He let me through his entourage of security and said to me: \"I love all your stuff, Moby\". He said he was a big fan of all our stuff, but he didn't bother to watch us. The next day he was much more frosty with me because he was with Mark Owen and Max Beesley. FP: Max Beastly? JH: Well, he was a little bit more distant and wouldn't look me in the eye. FP: Robbie was like John Travolta in Grease when he's with all his mates. How will The Darkness finish? In three separate groups using the same name playing piers and pubs, or a blaze of glory? From Tom Hicks JH: What is the end? What is at the end of the universe and what's stopping it and what is behind what's stopping it? I am going to fake my death. I can confirm that. You may think I am dead, but I am not dead, no matter how spectacular or tangible my demise, it will not be real. You will see me in supermarkets buying things. In terms of religion I am a lion. I walk alone. I have my own personal heaven and I don't want to share it. FP: We are here to annoy people. Just when you think were gone, we are going to be there, up your arse. All the time. We are going to be in your pub. You go home to try to escape, you can switch on the radio, the TV and we are going to be there. We are going to hound and harass you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
