London\u2019s male fashion shows, however, have traditionally been understated affairs \u2013 particularly when compared to their women\u2019s counterparts. But this season, something has changed. At parties and dinners in the run-up to this season\u2019s London Collections Men, talk was of wardrobe crises, borrowing clothes from magazine fashion cupboards, and the optimal deployment of that recently acquired piece by cult designer Craig Green. LCM\u2019s opening Topman show, on Friday, demonstrated the results of those endeavours: leopard print jackets vied for attention with silk pocket handkerchiefs, floral scarves and haute hoodies. Sunglasses were worn, unapologetically, inside. A scrum of street-style photographers captured every raw seam and naked mankle. \u201cPeople are definitely making more of an effort,\u201d says Shortlist style director Adrian Clark. \u201cThe biggest change I\u2019ve noticed is that a lot of designers contacted me this season to ask if I wanted to borrow clothes to wear to the shows.\u201d Lending clothes to much-photographed editors has long been the drill in womenswear, but in menswear this is new. Clearly London Collections Men is in the midst of a growth spurt. Only four years ago, menswear was judged to be such a poor relation to womenswear that there was no formal male equivalent to London fashion week. But since LCM\u2019s launch, in 2012 the number of designers showing has mushroomed from 46 to 77, while the market has boomed. Globally, menswear is growing faster than womenswear, with sales worth \u00a3298bn in 2014 \u2013 a year-on-year growth of 4.5% \u2013 compared with 3.7% for the women\u2019s market, now worth \u00a3448bn worldwide, according to Euromonitor. In the UK, menswear contributed \u00a312.9bn to the UK economy in 2014 \u2013 an annual upsurge of almost 5%. Mintel predicts that figure will be \u00a316.4bn by 2018. (Mintel estimates the 2014 value of womenswear to be \u00a326bn.) LCM\u2019s newest ambassador, Lewis Hamilton, is a living embodiment of this shift. The F1 driver has recently undergone a style evolution, experimenting with ever more esoteric outfits on the red carpet \u2013 such as Louis Vuitton menswear inspired by cult 1980s designer Christopher Nemeth \u2013 and wearing geek chic glasses and quirky hats. He joins a lineup of suit-wearing emissaries briefed with promoting British fashion to their fans around LCM, including musician Tinie Tempah, model David Gandy, presenters Dermot O\u2019Leary and Nick Grimshaw and Chinese actor Hu Bing. \u201cFashion is no longer just a girls\u2019 thing \u2013 those days are over,\u201d says Grimshaw. He believes Kanye West\u2019s love of fashion has helped men to get on board. \u201cI love that he is so vocal about it. Fashion can be seen as fluffy, or throwaway, but when you look into the work that goes into collections and the references, you see that it is an art form. I can\u2019t think of another man that is as vocal about it as [West] is,\u201d he says. So what\u2019s the look for menswear\u2019s finest this season? \u201cThey tend to fall into one of two camps,\u201d says Clark. \u201cThose who look like they don\u2019t give a shit, but actually everything\u2019s really considered, and those who look like extras from The Great Gatsby.\u201d Clark believes the divide echoes the reality of London menswear: \u201cCool street culture but also Savile Row history \u2013 that separation is what marks us out from womenswear.\u201dIf anything, says Clark, it is the artfully scruffy attendees who make the most effort. \u201cThat tailored look is actually a formula \u2013 you just need the right shape of beard, the right suit and shoes. The dressed-down look is more difficult to achieve. It\u2019s about getting the right type of vintage.Levi\u2019s are a thing among that crowd at the moment. And you can wear an APC sweatshirt but it can\u2019t be this season\u2019s \u2013 to show you were there at the beginning. It\u2019s about the fine details.\u201d \u201cYou can wear whatever you like at the shows,\u201d says Grimshaw. \u201cYou want to look stylish, but not styled.\u201d For Simon Chilvers, style director at Matchesfashion.com, it\u2019s all about Craig Green, the menswear designer so beloved that \u2013 as the fashion myth goes \u2013 critics weep at his shows. \u201cI\u2019m expecting to see the Craig Green jumper with the hole in the middle, and the padded utility stuff if it rains.\u201d Another key look, he says, will be the \u201cbohemian nerd cool dude thing\u201d spearheaded by the new creative director at Gucci. In womenswear the peacock has been absent for a few seasons, as many designers have favoured the androgynous, minimalist styles most famously backed by C\u00e9line over attention-grabbing designs. But for Chilvers, it\u2019s not a case of that bird taking flight and landing in menswear. \u201cThe mood in menswear is actually quite lo-fi and pared back,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to see that than anything more jazz hands.\u201dRather than a peacock then, what we\u2019re seeing is experimentation and confidence. As Hamilton told the Guardian, when his appointment was announced on Friday: \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of my professional life trying to fit in and prove that I can do my job. This feeling of uncertainty has faded as I\u2019ve been able to prove myself \u2026 It\u2019s that feeling that hasprobably influenced my style.\u201d Hamilton, like the menswear industry, is stepping into the spotlight \u2013 in ever more wonderful shoes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
