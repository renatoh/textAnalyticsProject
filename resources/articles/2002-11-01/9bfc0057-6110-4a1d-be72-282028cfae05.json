Peter Roebuck, the most influential cricket writer in Australia, warned after the first morning's slaughter at the Gabba that, unless England improved, \"this must be the last time their country is invited to play a five-match series\". He had a point. The idea of reducing Ashes series in Australia to three Tests has been trotted out so often in recent years that, in a rivalry thick with tradition, it has become almost a tradition itself. But this time the theory was greeted with vigorous nods. Maybe, just maybe, the Poms had bombed one time too many. What a difference a 384-run defeat makes. Crowds for the first Test touched 81,000, the biggest Brisbane attendance since the Bodyline summer of 1932-33. TV ratings soared; the number of Sydneysiders tuning in to last Sunday's anticlimax was almost double the number of viewers watching the news. Ticket sales for the remaining Tests are up 50% on the previous series four years ago. Rumours of the death of the five-Test Ashes series are officially off the agenda. \"The Ashes is one of the great things people look forward to,\" says Kim Hughes, the former Australia captain. Hughes believes the answer is not to reduce the number of Tests but to \"start praying the Poms get better. The average supporter I talk to just hopes to God that some bastard pitches up and can compete. The first touring team that does will be applauded all the way.\" Kerry O'Keeffe, the former Test leg-spinner and now a radio commentator, agrees that Australia versus England remains the game's biggest draw card. \"I was raised to do two things: to wait for the umpire's decision and to beat the Poms at cricket,\" he says. \"Playing in the early 1970s, England were the team to beat. I hardly think 30 years later we can put them on the same footing as New Zealand. Australians are raised with the idea that England is our toughest battle and you don't fight tough battles over short distances. It has to be five Tests.\" The spiralling crowd numbers and ratings figures support that view but these are the boom days for Australian Test crowds. All available evidence suggests they would happily walk miles to see Steve Waugh's men beat a team of one-legged Eskimos so long as they still knocked up 400 runs a day. Indeed if Tests were awarded in proportion to a team's competitiveness, rather than its spectator appeal, England would be lucky to sneak more than the occasional one-off match. In their last 15 Tests against Australia they have lost 11 times; only West Indies, who have also lost 11, boast so woeful a record. New Zealand, India, South Africa and Pakistan have all fared distinctly better, yet in the past decade none have been rewarded with more than three Tests against Australia. On paper it all adds up to one thing: the five-Test Ashes series is a dinosaur, a historical anachronism. \"There may be a view that we should start winding back this incredible tradition that is the Ashes but I'm not ready to jump down that course,\" says Tony Greig, who captained England in the mid-70s and has lived in Australia since. \"There was an incredible build-up to this series. There was also, among a lot of Australians, a slightly wary attitude towards what England might do. This may even stem from Bodyline, when most Australians thought Bradman would slaughter England and up came Jardine with the best performance in history as far as captaincy and strategy is concerned.\" One Australian who remains unconvinced by the romantic pull of the Ashes is Mike Coward, cricket columnist for The Australian newspaper and a long-time sceptic of the relevance of Anglo-Australian contests. Coward fears the Ashes have become a social, rather than sporting, occasion. The ultimate challenge for Australia's current crop, he says, is not the Ashes but the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, the prize for beating India in India. \"I don't say England are not entitled to five Tests; what I don't like is their automatic entitlement,\" says Coward. \"Just because the Ashes is the oldest trophy, and just because it has produced some marvellous memories, that doesn't give them a divine right to five Tests. It should be a level playing field. If they can't provide consistently good competition with their riches and resources and population, then other countries should get an opportunity.\" For now, though, thrashing the Poms in five prolonged, predictable Tests is one of the little luxuries that Australians will not let go of in a hurry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
