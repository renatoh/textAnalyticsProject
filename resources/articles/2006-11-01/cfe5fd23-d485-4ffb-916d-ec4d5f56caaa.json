Hence the need for a fitting tribute today on its 10 th birthday. At the party tonight, a rare variety of people will celebrate some major victories; the crowd of well-wishers will range from the heads of major multinational banks to the cleaners who do the night shifts which ensure their offices are spotless. The secret of Telco's success has been an unusual method of mobilisation; it connects religious institutions such as churches and mosques as well as schools and trade unions. In an area like East London of high immigration and ethnic diversity, the technique has been extraordinarily effective in reaching communities which are amongst some of the most deprived and least likely to participate in conventional politics in the country. Many faith communities in East London are a vital form of social capital - often the only form of social capital in a workforce which is concentrated in low paid, low unionised work. From black evangelical churches to Bangladeshi Muslims, from old Irish Catholic congregations to African Pentecostalists: this is a rare form of what the academics call \"bridging capital\" - joining together on campaigns of common concern, inspired by their very different religious traditions. Their most successful campaign was an American import, The Living Wage. A campaign which had scored notable successes in US cities. Telco were the first to put this on the political agenda; they argued that in an area of high rents and transport costs, a national minimum wage had limited relevance if the entrenched poverty of the capital was to be tackled (remember, a shocking fact: half of all children in London are living in poverty according to government measures - remember that the next time you sit on a bus or walk down a street and see the children around you). So they devised - with expert academic help - a living wage sufficient to enable someone to live in London. The first target of the Living Wage campaign was the invisible army of cleaners who arrive every evening in Canary Wharf and disappear long before the first office workers arrive. It was a fascinating case of the contract economy; everyone maintained that it wasn't their responsibility to ensure that the cleaners were adequately paid. The banks said it was all up to the contractors and the contractors said higher wages would cut into their small profits and if they upped the price of the contract, they would lose it. Everyone denied responsibility. But Telco's campaign of naming and shaming and of taking delegations in to meet chief executives paid off - particularly with Barclays who set a pioneering example. Many other banks followed suit. Since then the concept has been taken on by the Mayor of London, Ken Livingston as well as the 2012 Olympics and many other organisations. Telco has now got the hotel sector in its sights. It is a notoriously hard industry to unionise, characterised by a transient workforce and chronic low pay. But its clever combination of media savviness and old-fashioned grass roots activism make it a winning formula.
