Kenna last played for the Republic in their Euro 2000 qualifying play-off against Turkey in Bursa and, at the age of 32, the Birmingham City captain had acknowledged it was unlikely he would ever play for his country again. His chances looked increasingly remote last season after falling out of favour at Blackburn Rovers and being farmed out on loan to Wigan Athletic and Tranmere Rovers . But his move to St Andrew's six months ago has rejuvenated his career. He gets his chance because Steve Finnan of Fulham and Tottenham's Stephen Carr are ruled out by injury, and McCarthy's private concerns about the form of Ian Harte and Gary Kelly make it feasible that Kenna may be required to win his 28th cap. McCarthy has also restored Andy O'Brien to his squad after the Newcastle central defender missed last month's 4-2 defeat in Russia because of shin splints. However, Bobby Robson revealed yesterday that O'Brien is suffering from a tweaked hamstring and may have to pull out. John O'Shea retains his place after his excellent performances for Manchester United, both at full-back and at centre-half, but McCarthy is likely to keep faith with West Ham's Gary Breen alongside the captain Kenny Cunningham in the middle of defence. \"John O'Shea has done very well for Manchester United this season that's why he is in the squad and putting pressure on those vying for the central defensive roles,\" said McCarthy. Squad: Given (Newcastle), Kiely (Charlton), Colgan (Hibernian), Harte (Leeds), Breen (West Ham), Kelly (Leeds), Cunningham (Birmingham), O'Shea (Manchester United), O'Brien (Newcastle), Babb (Sunderland), Holland (Ipswich), Healy (Celtic), Kinsella (Aston Villa), Carsley (Everton), Delap (Southampton), McPhail (Leeds), Kilbane (Sunderland), Keane (Tottenham), Morrison (Birmingham), Duff (Blackburn), Doherty (Tottenham), Kenna (Birmingham)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
