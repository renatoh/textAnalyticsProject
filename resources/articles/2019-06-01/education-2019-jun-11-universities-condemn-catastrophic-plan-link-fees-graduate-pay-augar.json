Last week the prime minister\u2019s commission on post-18 education funding called for a cut in university tuition fees from \u00a39,250 to \u00a37,500 a year. The review, chaired by former equities broker Philip Augar, said the government should make up the funding gap, which vice-chancellors say will amount to around \u00a31.8bn. In addition, it called on the government to adjust support for different subjects to reflect the economic and social \u201cvalue\u201d of degrees, and how much they cost to teach. This proposal has sparked alarm in institutions with a heavy bias towards arts and humanities subjects, where graduates are less likely to earn high salaries early in their careers. Dr Jason Scott-Warren, a lecturer in English at Cambridge University, says: \u201cThe idea of measuring the success of degrees by graduate earnings is despicable and we can only hope that future governments will abandon this market logic.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt ought to be obvious that some degree courses are designed as feeders for particular forms of employment while others exist to nurture intelligence, to push the boundaries of our understanding and to make human lives worth living.\u201d The commission\u2019s findings were influenced by experimental new government data that tracks graduates to the age of 29 through their tax returns. The Longitudinal Educational Outcomes data shows that a 29-year-old male economics graduate will earn on average 33% more than his peers without a degree, but a male creative arts graduate of the same age will earn 14% less than peers who haven\u2019t been to university. Male graduates also don\u2019t see any major salary benefit by age 29 if they studied subjects such as English and philosophy, agriculture, psychology, languages and history. Prof Kate Williams, the television historian and author, says: \u201cIt is wrong to value jobs by how much we get paid. If we are really saying the only jobs that are worthwhile are in banking or high-level accountancy, I find that bizarre and ridiculous.\u201d Williams, a professor of public engagement with history at Reading University, who made the popular Royal Wives of Windsor series, says: \u201cMany history graduates retrain as lawyers and earn a huge amount of money. But others just love history. They want to become curators and work in museums, or heritage, or television or teach history. None of those jobs will mean starting out with a big salary.\u201d Nigel Carrington, the vice-chancellor of the University of the Arts London, which includes Central Saint Martins and the London College of Fashion, warns that if fees are cut and money isn\u2019t put back into arts and design courses there will be \u201ccatastrophic effects\u201d for some universities. He says his colleges would be forced to take fewer UK students and more international students, who pay higher fees. He adds that institutions outside big cities might find it harder to attract more foreign students to stay afloat. \u201cThere are arts schools outside London that will be devastated,\u201d he says. The Augar review does at least acknowledge that a course\u2019s value can be measured in ways besides cash returns, Carrington says, but the education secretary, Damian Hinds, shows no such nuance. \u201cHe focuses explicitly on early career earnings as the primary marker of value for money and has appeared specifically to focus on art and design. Presumably the intention is to reduce the number of students studying subjects in areas like the arts. That is very worrying.\u201d Carrington adds that the new salary data overlooks the fact that many arts graduates will freelance in the early years of their career, and freelance salaries will never match those in permanent employment. Megan Grinham, a third-year fashion student at Norwich University of the Arts (NUA), says that when she chose her course she was far more interested in pursuing her passion than in how much she would earn. Grinham, whose high-vis fashion range was paraded on stage at London Graduate Fashion Week this month, says: \u201cYou can\u2019t base value on salary. Why don\u2019t they look instead at all the new ideas we are creating?\u201d She adds: \u201cThe creative arts are sometimes looked down on, but my family and friends know it isn\u2019t an easy ride. In my final year I\u2019ve been in the studio from 9am til 9pm every day and worked at weekends. I\u2019ve loved every minute of my degree and learned so much about all aspects of the fashion industry.\u201d Prof John Last, the vice-chancellor of NUA, is \u201csaddened\u201d by the funding review\u2019s failure to see the strategic importance of creative subjects. \u201cThe creative industries are now calculated to contribute \u00a3100bn to the UK economy. That\u2019s not a lightweight degree option,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are a nation that celebrates our Oscar winners and our big names in fashion, but we don\u2019t ask where they came from. If that education pipeline is broken we will be poorer as a country.\u201d One head of a Russell Group university adds that there is no guarantee that even high-cost subjects will be properly supported after any fees cut. \u201cThe obvious danger is that the Treasury will decide that \u00a31.8bn would be better spent elsewhere. There is a massive danger that the difference will not be made up.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2019 to give the full name of university that Nigel Carrington is vice-chancellor of, the University of the Arts London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
