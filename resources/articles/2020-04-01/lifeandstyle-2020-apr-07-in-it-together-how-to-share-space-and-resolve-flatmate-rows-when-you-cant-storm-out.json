But as the coronavirus lockdown wears on, we\u2019re having to spend more time than ever cooped up in them. While all those useful places we once went to escape \u2013 the pubs, cafes, gyms and even friends\u2019 homes \u2013 are out of bounds. Social distancing isn\u2019t a problem for me; I\u2019ve been practising it for years. If I could avoid my own shadow I would. However, for the less introverted and most of you who don\u2019t reserve passing glances with long-time housemates solely for special occasions (such as when you have no choice), navigating this period might be quite difficult. For those sharing with friends, staying in might be slightly more bearable. But as the weeks wear on, it would be natural for tempers to fray even among the tightest groups. Those living with strangers may find it more awkward \u2013 although it could also be an opportunity to make a shared space more of a home. So how can you make sure you come out of this period with friendships intact, or deeper bonds formed? Here are some tips for successful lockdown living. How to help an anxious housemate The pandemic is affecting people in many different ways. Some manage to keep a level head, follow the official advice and make the best of it. Others find their worries spiralling, spending their time glued to 24-hour news feeds and weighing up every cough and hot flush with frantic Googling. If you have a housemate who is suffering with anxiety it may feel natural to rush to reassure them or dismiss their fears. But, says Dr Warren Mansell, a reader in clinical psychology at the University of Manchester, you should try to avoid this. \u201cAsk them what they are really concerned about, and what they are worried might happen. Even then, you don\u2019t need to provide reassurance, because often when people express their worries out loud, they question it themselves. So, just help them explore what they are worried about and what they want right now.\u201d How should you deal with a flatmate who is taking hygiene to extremes \u2013 or ignoring it completely? Mess is always a problem in house shares, even at the best of times. At one end, there\u2019s the housemate who is prone to leaving passive-aggressive notes for those who aren\u2019t following their high standards. Then there\u2019s the housemate whose bedroom smells vaguely like cheese. But there are things you can do to avoid conflict when avoiding your housemate is impossible. \u201cYou can help these people who are overly concerned by showing that you are following the recommendations of washing your hands at appropriate times,\u201d says Dr Anisha Patel-Dunn, a psychiatrist and chief medical officer at the US healthcare company LifeStance Health. \u201cPutting a sign in the kitchen and bathroom showing what the recommendations are can be helpful for both those who are overly concerned or messy.\u201d Or you could just have a chat. \u201cEveryone has different standards for hygiene and tidiness, and this will just be made more apparent when living with each other all day in lockdown,\u201d says Mansell. Often it is easy to assume what is behind another person\u2019s messy or fussy behaviour \u2013 and easy to get it wrong. So the solution is to talk, ask and listen. What can you do if your housemate is flouting social-distancing rules? Not everyone is taking the outbreak as seriously as they need to. For every anxious housemate, there is one who is still going out and visiting friends. Some of the myths around Covid-19 have endured since the initial outbreak. People are still comparing it to seasonal flu and concluding that the lockdown is an overreaction, while some still think being young and healthy makes you invulnerable. These myths are especially convincing when bouncing around an echo chamber. If one of your housemates is trapped in one, there are ways to bring them out. \u201cTry to understand that some people are reacting to the current situation with denial,\u201d says Patel-Dunn \u201cBe honest and try and use \u2018I\u2019 statements so as to not make your housemate feel defensive: \u2018I am feeling uncomfortable as I don\u2019t feel you are following social-distancing rules. This is making me worried that we are all going to get sick.\u2019 It can be helpful to gently direct them to what local and national officials are recommending.\u201d How can you share space fairly if you are all working from home? Those of us lucky enough to still have a job are working from our beds, sofas and kitchen tables. But if everyone in your household is having to work from home there could be landgrabs for the best spot. I have been practising bedroom journalism since the lockdown began, but others might prefer to keep their workspace separate from where they sleep. Lee Chambers, an environmental psychologist and founder of the life-coaching company Essentialise Workplace Wellbeing, says communication is key. \u201cIt really comes down to scheduling, designating spaces and making it really clear,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to actively listen when people are expressing concerns or difficulties. Try to designate yourselves a workspace \u2013 one particular space that is sanitised.\u201d Dr Elena Touroni, a consultant psychologist and co-founder of the Chelsea Psychology Clinic, agrees. \u201cUltimately, it comes down to communication and negotiation,\u201d she says. \u201cEnsure that there is a fair amount of taking it in turns if you need to be sharing the living room, for instance. That\u2019s going to save anyone from feeling resentful or as though their needs aren\u2019t being met.\u201d What if you can\u2019t find a quiet place to work? Many of us suddenly find ourselves with all the time in the world to twiddle our thumbs or use them to turn the volume up on our sound systems. \u201cJust be mindful of how your flatmates live. The technology is there to make sure that you\u2019re not disturbing each other,\u201d says Chambers. Using headphones is essential. \u201cThere is a lot of social communication going on now across video platforms.\u201d Approaching your housemates about this can be difficult, especially if you don\u2019t know them very well \u2013 or at all. \u201cIt is important to stay calm and try not to get upset as this won\u2019t be helpful,\u201d says Patel-Dunn. Like cooking and cleaning, devising a plan around work and play could be the way to go. \u201cAsking your housemates to all work on setting up a schedule for everyone to abide by in the house, including quiet time, can be helpful in showing respect for one another\u2019s time and creating a routine,\u201d she adds. How do you end an argument when you can\u2019t leave the house? Storming out is not really an option at the moment, especially if you\u2019ve already used your approved daily dose of exercise. So, as Flounce City is officially closed, conflict-resolution techniques are called for. \u201cThere is no right way to end an argument,\u201d says Mansell. \u201cAgain though, as soon as you can shift the argument to \u2018I want \u2026\u2019 and \u2018It makes me feel \u2026\u2019, rather than \u2018You do \u2026\u2019 and any overtly or implicitly critical comments, the better. Remind yourself that the goal is always some kind of compromise and understanding of the other person\u2019s point of view, and never just to \u2018win\u2019.\u201d What should you do if you think your housemate has Covid-19? With the lack of testing, we are all having to become expert symptom spotters, but we need to be careful about alarming people. \u201cIt will depend very much on what your existing relationship is with them as to when to tell them,\u201d says Mansell. \u201cIf you are hesitant to tell them, think why. Is your worst fear about telling them likely to happen or not?\u201d If someone in your household presents with the common symptoms (a fever and persistent cough) then you should follow the official guidelines, self-isolate and take steps to improve the hygiene in your home. Now you are facing weeks locked together, is it time to tell your flatmate you fancy them? \u201cProbably not!\u201d says Touroni. \u201cThe reality is that you\u2019re going to have to spend a considerable period of time with them, and it might end up becoming uncomfortable for both of you if the feelings aren\u2019t reciprocated. This is not the time to be taking major relational risks, particularly as we don\u2019t have access to the same coping mechanisms or distractions that would otherwise provide us with some comfort.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
