Selby, the world No95, had rushed downstairs at his hotel at 1.30am on the night before the match believing it was the afternoon and time to play. He even tried to order a taxi before a concierge told him the time. He turned up 13 hours later and opened a 3-0 advantage. Hendry cleared green-to-black to make it 3-1 but breaks of 65 and 84 completed the shock result of the season. \"Somehow I didn't notice it was dark,\" said Selby, 18. \"I was so embarrassed that when a referee who was coming in asked what I was doing I pretended I was going to practice.\" Hendry, who claimed he would not have recognised Selby before the match, said: \"I haven't been outplayed like that all season. Mark's safety was superb, he hardly missed a pot and his positional play was pinpoint. I'd never seen him before and I expected to win, but these days you can never take anything for granted.\" Ronnie O'Sullivan, the world champion, beaten 6-5 by Jimmy White in the last 16 of the Benson &amp; Hedges Masters this month, turned the tables by winning 5-1 in only 67 minutes to reach the last eight. Ken Doherty, the world No4, advanced with a 5-2 victory over Joe Perry. The Irishman meets Anthony Hamilton, a 5-3 winner over the Australian Quinten Hann, who will be appearing in his first quarter-final for two years. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
