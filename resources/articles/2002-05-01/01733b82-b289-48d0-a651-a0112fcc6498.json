The Rise 500 will be invited to attend one day at The Guardian Graduate Conference, taking place on October 16 to 18, 2002 at EXCEL in London's Docklands, where they will have the chance to hear inspirational speakers, meet Rise journalists and front cover stars and network with employers. If that wasn't enough, each day we'll be giving away one Compaq iPaq handheld computer. Tell us, in no more than 100 words, what you've done to merit a place in the Rise 500 . Give it a headline of no more than 10 words and paste your story into the body of an email message. Attach your CV, including details of degree grade (or expected grade) and contact details for two referees.
