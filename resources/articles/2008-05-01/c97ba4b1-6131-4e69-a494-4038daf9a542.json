Hope (1769-1831) belongs in the company of Horace Walpole, William Beckford and Sir John Soane: people of original taste and talent, who made legendary homes and filled them with quite extraordinary collections. Hope, a very wealthy merchant-banker whose family (Scottish in origin) came to London from Amsterdam, shortly after the French revolution, made himself two homes. The mission of the first, in Duchess Street near Cavendish Square, was to pioneer neo-classical taste in London - but the term neoclassical has to be stretched in this case to include Egyptian revival and an \"Indian room\" decorated in a \"Saracenic\" and \"Moorish\" style. Its ceiling, Hope explained, \"imitated from those prevailing in Turkish palaces, consists of a canopy of trellice-work ... The border and the compartments of this ceiling display foliage, flowers, peacock's feathers, and other ornaments of a rich hue, and of a delicate texture, which ... seem peculiarly adapted for this lofty and suspended situation.\" When he said the hues were rich, he meant it. He had travelled in the Middle East, and was familiar with the strong colours of Islamic tiles. His Indian room featured Persian carpets on the floor, and specially commissioned views of India on the walls. All this was done in about 1800, which predated the orientalism of the Brighton Pavilion by some 15 years. One has to imagine something on the scale of the Wallace Collection in Manchester Square, in London, a house (originally designed by Robert Adam) built around a courtyard, and incorporating - in a palatial sequence of rooms - a statue gallery, picture gallery, four \"vase rooms\" for the display of Greek pots, in addition to the Egyptian and Indian rooms, an Aurora room and a \"Lararium\" (a shrine for the household gods). Each interior was designed by Hope himself, as were the furniture and all the fixtures and fittings, the sconces for the lamps, the candelabras, the silverware, the bronze ornaments. And although Hope's collections have long since been dispersed, one can deduce a great deal about what his London house was like because he published a book about it all, in 1807, called Household Furniture. The purpose of this work - the first of its kind to be commercially printed - was to make it possible for others to copy Hope's ideas. The second home, in a wooded Surrey valley not far from Dorking, was called the Deepdene. Again, an adaptation of an existing building, the Deepdene was a demonstration of the picturesque style, which meant that, in the manner of a picture, it was asymmetrical. It had a tower, an \"Italianate\" belvedere, of a kind new to England - indeed, you might say new to architecture. One has to think quite hard, looking at images of this tower, before one realises exactly what it was in Italy that was being imitated, it has been so developed in the adaptation. More extraordinary, in this pursuit of the asymmetrical, is a wing that Hope added to this country house at a 45-degree angle to the existing structure. A large part of this wing consists of a conservatory and statue gallery, leading down to a \"theatre of the arts\", which was a structure like a miniature Roman theatre, the banked seating of which served as a display platform for yet more classical relics. The relation of house to garden is very marked, in the illustrations of the Deepdene that survive. There is a sense that the chief consideration is for the views afforded, both from inside the house looking out past the treasured relics, and from all kinds of vantage points in the grounds. That the place did indeed possess a power to enchant is illustrated by the fact that Disraeli acknowledged Coningsby to have been \"conceived and partly executed amidst the glades and galleries of Deepdene\". The expression \"glades and galleries\" reflects something of the intended effect: the woods came up very near to the house, but the garden was also full of colour. There were peacocks and large agaves in pots, giving a bright, sharp, exotic look. Inside, a colonnaded hall of double height displayed classical statuary: these were the galleries one might wander, deep in thought. And once again a vase room, giving home to part of the collection which had been transferred from London, and which had originally been purchased from Sir William Hamilton, the volcano-loving husband of Nelson's Emma. By the 1820s, the taste for rich colours had come to seem, to a younger generation, \"heavy &amp; inharmonious, tinselly, tawdry\". This was an era of tent beds and tent rooms, a military fashion brought from Napoleonic Paris, which not only gave a room the air of being something put up in the course of a campaign, but also contained a reference to the tent as being one of the primeval forms of domestic architecture. When Hope died, his son had the house remodelled and revised, although there is still something of its chief creator's vision to be seen in the photographs taken of it for Country Life in 1899. By now, the taste for Hope's furniture and his interior style was so specialised that when the contents of the Deepdene were dispersed in 1917, there was really only one purchaser interested in the furniture: Edward Knoblock, the author of Kismet. Regency itself, as a style, was generally discounted, and the Brighton Pavilion considered utterly ridiculous. Reading only slightly between the lines of the excellent catalogue, we find, however, that this taste was kept alive by a small minority of gay men, including Lord Gerald Wellesley, doomed (when he became Duke of Wellington) to the nickname The Iron Duchess. British Rail took over the Deepdene, and pulled it down in 1968-69."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
