As Rowena Mason and Kate Proctor report, Corbyn made the allegation as he defended himself against Johnson\u2019s charge that his handling of antisemitism complaints within the Labour party was a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d. Here is their story in full. And here are verdicts on the debate from a Guardian panel, with contributions from Martin Kettle, Katy Balls, Owen Jones, and Gaby Hinsliff. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. And here are the figures from the YouGov poll showing who won on particular issues. Boris Johnson was ahead on being likeable, on being prime ministerial, on Brexit, on goverment spending and on security and terrorism. And Jeremy Corbyn was ahead on being trustworthy, on being in touch with ordinary people. The results are roughly the same as they were when YouGov did a poll after the ITV leaders\u2019 debate last month. But I\u2019ve included figures showing how the gap between the leaders on each measure has changed. The biggest change has been on government spending. Johnson is still ahead on this measure, but by much less than after the ITV debate. Issues on which Boris Johnson won Who do you think came across as more likeable? 55% Boris Johnson, 36% Jeremy Corbyn, 9% Don\u2019t know Johnson ahead by 19 points (+2 from his lead on this measure in the YouGov poll after the ITV debate) Who do you think came across as more prime ministerial? 54% Boris Johnson, 30% Jeremy Corbyn, 17% Don\u2019t know Johnson ahead by 14 (-1) Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on Brexit? 62% Boris Johnson, 29% Jeremy Corbyn, 9% Don\u2019t know Johnson ahead by 33 (-3) Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on government spending? 48% Boris Johnson, 43% Jeremy Corbyn, 9% Don\u2019t know Johnson ahead by 5 (-10) Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on security and anti-terrorism? 55% Boris Johnson, 34% Jeremy Corbyn, 11% Don\u2019t know Johnson ahead by 21 (this question was not asked after the ITV debate) Issues on which Jeremy Corbyn won Who do you think came across as more trustworthy? 38% Boris Johnson, 48% Jeremy Corbyn, 14% Don\u2019t know Corbyn ahead by 10 points (+5 from his lead on this measures in the YouGov poll after the ITV debate) Who do you think came across as more in touch with ordinary people? 29% Boris Johnson, 57% Jeremy Corbyn, 14% Don\u2019t know Corbyn ahead by 28 (-6) Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on NHS? 38% Boris Johnson, 55% Jeremy Corbyn, 8% Don\u2019t know Corbyn ahead by 17 (+1) Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s take on how Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn both performed. Here are more findings from the YouGov polling. (This is an expanded and slightly revised version of the snap verdict posted earlier.) The conventional wisdom among the punditocracy has been that this was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s last chance to change the dynamics of this contest, and if that was the case he didn\u2019t manage it, even though in parts he had the best of the debate. The YouGov poll suggests Boris Johnson narrowly came out on top when viewers were asked who won, but on another measure Corbyn did better. Johnson\u2019s message about Labour not offering certainty on Brexit is a powerful one, and if anything the PM made it even more effectively tonight than he did in the ITV debate two and a half weeks ago. That said, Corbyn had the best moment, when he came back at Johnson over \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d and said what was a failure of leadership was using racist language. It was a powerful blow, and perhaps the best moment of the debate. After a question about Islamophobia and antisemitism, when Corbyn condemned racism in general terms, but declined to say that Johnson was personally culpable in this regard, Johnson switched the topic back to leadership. He said: I think that, you know, Mr Corbyn, I\u2019m sure is very well intentioned. But I think in his handling of this particular issue, his unwillingness to take a stand, to stand up for Jewish people in the Labour party. His unwillingness to protect them, to put an arm round them, is in my view a failure of leadership. You cannot be neutral on questions like this, any more, in my view, than you can try to lead this country and be neutral on the issue of Brexit. It is a failure to take a stand, to have a point of view, that in the end will cost this country gravely and deeply. At this point Corbyn hit back: A failure of leadership is when you use racist remarks to describe people in different countries or in our society. I will never do that and my party will never do that. In the first debate between the two leaders, Johnson\u2019s track record of using racist language in his journalism did not come up at all, and this moment left one wondering if Corbyn should have gone on the offensive on this issue much earlier in the campaign. It was an effective retort, but it did not silence Johnson and he recovered very well by pivoting back to Brexit, and asking of Corbyn\u2019s solution to Brexit: where is it? This has been Johnson\u2019s most powerful message throughout the campaign and tonight, although much of what he said was familiar, he was probably sharper and more incisive on this point than he has been before. He joked about how Corbyn\u2019s Brexit deal would be a \u201cmystery deal\u201d, because it was not clear what would be in it, and how he could not identify who would negotiate it in the shadow cabinet because most of Corbyn\u2019s team back remain. Johnson also claimed that, if he were able to get the UK out of the EU by the end of January next year, investment worth \u00a3150bn would come flooding into the country (an assertion that is unlikely to survive factchecking). For Corbyn, Brexit was defensive territory, but at least the audience was not as sceptical when he was explaining Labour\u2019s policy as it was in the ITV debate and he may have made an impression with his argument that Johnson\u2019s trade deal with the US might take seven years to negotiate \u2013 a point he made repeatedly. Corbyn was better on domestic policy. Although he may have overdone the tendency to reference the 1940s, he was calm and persuasive when arguing that Labour\u2019s plans to increase the level of state spending would only take the UK up towards an EU average, and on crime and the London Bridge terror attacks his points about the impact of prison cuts were at least as potent as anything Johnson said about sentencing. Much of what was said replicated what was said in the ITV debate, and that probably explains why the YouGov snap polling has recorded almost exactly the same verdict as it did last month. The most interesting question of the night came when Nick Robinson asked them which had done most to raise living standards: socialism or capitalism. Because it was a quick-fire round, we just got stock answers. But a one-hour debate between Johnson and Corbyn exploring this topic alone in more detail would have made excellent TV, and would probably have ended up being more illuminating. And here is the verdict from the YouGov poll. This is almost identical to the result of the poll from the ITV debate two and a half weeks ago, which had Johnson winning that encounter by 51% to 49%. See 7.32pm. The conventional wisdom among the punditocracy has been that this was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s last chance to change the dynamics of this contest, and if that was the case he probably didn\u2019t manage it, even though he may well have had the best of the debate. The Johnson message about Labour not offering certainty on Brexit is a powerful one, and if anything the PM made it even more effectively tonight than he did in the ITV debate two and a half weeks ago. That said, Corbyn had the best moment, when he came back at Johnson over \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d and said what was a failure of leadership was using racist language. It was a powerful blow, and perhaps the best moment of the debate. Corbyn also seemed stronger than Johnson on domestic policy. But probably not strong enough to shake up a campaign that (in terms of voting intention) the Tories seem to be winning. I will post a beefed-up version of this shortly. They are now on closing statements. Corbyn says on Thursday we can vote for real change. And Johnson says on Thursday we can vote to get Brexit over and move on. And that\u2019s it. The debate is over. I will have a verdict, reaction, analysis and a summary coming up. Q: What punishment should there be for politicians who lie during an election campaign? Johnson says they should have to go on their knees and (he pauses for a bit), and scourge themselves in the Commons with copies of the documents they claim say one thing when they actually say another. Q: Does it bother you that a diplomat has resigned today because she thinks the government is lying? Johnson says he does not know about this case. Corbyn says, when people put false numbers on buses in campaigns, there is a case for someone to police false claims. Johnson says the amount of money we are paying to the EU is going up. And he says, with the debate almost over, we still don\u2019t know what Corbyn\u2019s Brexit plan is. Q: What would you do to keep the hate out of politics? Johnson says this is an important point. On prejudice, Islamophobia, antisemitism \u2013 he is going to have an independent inquiry. Anyone in his party who is guilty will be out \u201cfirst bounce\u201d. Johnson says the scratchiness of politics, and the acrimony, is a consequence of the failure to get things done. Q: You say people get thrown out on first bounce. But you have candidates have have retweeted Tommy Robinson criticising Muslims. Johnson says all those candidates have apologised, or are being investigated. He says Labour\u2019s record on antisemitism is worse. Corbyn says there never will be any place for antisemitism in his party. Q: People says, if blacks were complaining about racism in your party, you would accept what they said. But you don\u2019t with Jewish people. Corbyn says has accepted there is a problem. He says he never uses racist language in any form. Q: Are you saying Johnson does? Corbyn leaves the audience to draw its own conclusion. Johnson says Corbyn\u2019s failure to take a stand on this is a failure of leadership. He says this is like Corbyn\u2019s failure of leadership of Brexit. Corbyn says a failure of leadership is when you use racist language to describe people in our society, and he will never do it. Of course there must be a solution to Brexit, he says. Johnson asks: What is it? He says he has not heard it. Corbyn says he hopes Johnson will understand the importance of using appropriate language. Factcheck Claim: Johnson says the Parole Board and probation were not involved in the release of Usman Khan, the terrorist behind the London Bridge attack on 29 November. Reality: The Parole Board was not involved in the case of Khan as he was released on automatic release. But the probation service is always involved in the release of any offender on licence, as it is the body responsible for the management of offenders in the community. Corbyn says there are no plans whatsoever to disband MI5, or any part of our security services. He says he has had terrorist attacks in his constituency. He knows how important it is to keep people safe. Factcheck Claim: A \u201cblockade\u201d in parliament is blocking the government\u2019s ability to change the law on automatic early release. Reality: During their party conference, the Conservatives proposed to scrap the automatic release at the midway point for some serious sexual and violent offenders. The government could present a bill to pass through parliament regardless of whether Brexit or the election is happening. To tie it to the Brexit deadlock is misleading. Q: Are you prepared to put public safety ahead of human rights? Corbyn says it is not an either/or. You have to ensure the police, the prison service and the probation service are there, and properly funded. Human rights are our defence. There is no reason to compromise them. Johnson says he agrees there is no need to compromise human rights. But he does not think it was right that the London Bridge attacker was allowed out early. Q: What is wrong with the idea that prisoners should serve their full sentence? Corbyn says one day almost all prisoners will come out. You need proper rehabilitation. He says early release can help with that. And you need to fund probation properly. If you don\u2019t, we all pay a price. Q: Jack Merritt\u2019s father said his son did not want a society where we lock people up and throw away the key. Johnson says he feels very sorry for Merritt\u2019s family. But we must put public safety first. Automatic early release is completely unreasonable. Q: What about Corbyn\u2019s point that you have decimated the prison service and the probation service? Johnson says, in this case, the probation service was not involved. Corbyn says we have seriously overcrowded prisons, and when that happens rehabilitation suffers. He says he accepts that there should be a review before people are released. What happened is appalling. Johnson says Corbyn has consistently voted against longer sentences. And Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has called for it to be disbanded. (Johnson is referring to a Commons early day motion Abbott signed in the 1980s.) Factcheck Claim: Brexit will allow a Conservative government to cut VAT on sanitary products, Johnson claims. Reality: EU rules do currently prevent a UK government from reducing VAT on sanitary products from the current rate of 20% to anything below 5%, so the statement is correct. However, new rules proposed by the EU will allow governments to introduce a 0% rate on these products. Q: What do you say to the claim that businesses need certainty, and that they would not get it under you? Corbyn says under Labour there would be one of two Brexits. And people would know what Brexit would be like. Q: You are both planning lots of spending. How will we pay? Johnson says he plans to spend more in areas like the police and the NHS, but the Tories would not borrow to increase spending as much as Labour. Under Labour\u2019s plans, ordinary people would pay more, he says. Corbyn says Labour is the only party with a fully costed plan. He says we have gone too far in the direction of free market economics. If all Labour\u2019s plans were implemented, the size of the state would only just about reach France\u2019s. Johnson says he won\u2019t rack up such debts that you end up with huge interest rates. He says Labour always ends with a crisis. Corbyn and McDonnell would start with one. Q: The IFS said your plans were not realistic. Corbyn does not accept that. He says they questioned some aspects of it. Johnson says, if you are going to have a dynamic economy, you cannot clobber business with higher tax. Q: The IFS says your plan is not credible. On the contrary, says Johnson. He says it is a great, great programme. Labour would have a fiscal meltdown. He says he would get the country move. The economy drag anchor of Brexit on the economy should not be underestimated, he says. Corbyn says the Tories always look after those at the top. It is communities that pay for it. He says we must rebalance our society. He would raise corporation tax to 26%. That would be lower than it was in 2010, lower than in France, and lower than in the USA. Johnson says a Corbyn-Sturgeon coalition would be an economic disaster. Corbyn says business organisation cannot stand the uncertainty they have. Factcheck Claim: Jeremy Corbyn says his party will invest \u00a340bn in the NHS. Reality: Labour party literature consistently says that \u00a326bn will be committed to the NHS. The \u00a340bn figure appears to be new. It is unclear if increasing health spending by Labour\u2019s previous figure of \u00a326bn would be enough to deliver all the improvements it is seeking. Q: What does more to raise living standards \u2013 socialism or capitalism? Corbyn says socialism, in this country and in other countries, for instance under the postwar government. Johnson says he believes in supporting capitalism under a one nation government. Q: Labour sent out an email asking people to consider what it would be like having a five-figure bill for cancer treatment. Why did you do that? Corbyn says that is what you would end up with under a Trump trade deal. Q: Are you still claiming the NHS is up for sale? The documents you released don\u2019t say that. Corbyn says people should read them. Extending the life of patents would increase drug costs. He says President Trump says people don\u2019t pay enough for American drugs. Johnson says this is Bermuda Triangle stuff. Corbyn will be talking about little green men next. He says he loves the NHS, and will not sell it off. Q: The documents show the US wants more access to the NHS. Johnson says he has made it clear that won\u2019t happen. He says it was Labour that introduced privatisation in the first place. Corbyn says Johnson\u2019s party opposed the NHS in the first place. Johnson says that was in the 1940s. He says he believes passionately in the NHS. Corbyn says it is a fact that there are 43,000 nurse vacancies. Factcheck Claim: Boris Johnson will spend at least seven years negotiating with the US on access to our public services and the price of medicines, which Jeremy Corbyn says are up for negotiation, and he knows he can\u2019t get a deal quickly with the US because of the way the political system works there. Reality: It will not necessarily take that long for a deal to be worked out \u2013 the US has previously agreed trade deals with countries in a matter of months \u2013 a deal with Jordan, for instance, took just four months. However, a deal with the UK is likely to be a lot more complex and lengthy. Unredacted documents released by Labour revealing details of high profile UK-US trade talks showed that over the last two years officials have regularly discussed healthcare, including the structures in place which moderate the prices of drugs in the UK. The NHS may not be \u201cfor sale\u201d but healthcare is certainly on the table. Q: I am going to retrain as a nurse. How will you make people like me stay? Johnson says he is bringing back bursaries for nurses. The Tories would have special visa applications for nurses, he says. He says he cannot understand how Labour thinks it could help the NHS by having a four-day week. Corbyn says it was the Tories who cut the bursary for student nurses. Labour would fund the NHS properly. He says Johnson promised 40 new hospitals, which became 20, and then six. Johnson says he has a clear agenda, to build 40 hospitals. Only six are funded now. But the seed funding is going in, so after 10 years there will be 40. Corbyn says it is not credible to make promises like this without having a proper plan. Q: Is it credible to have a four-day working week? Corbyn says he wants to bring down working hours. But there would not be a four-day week in the NHS. Johnson claims John McDonnell said there would be a four-day working week in the NHS. He claims there is investment worth \u00a3150bn waiting to come into the UK if he can get Brexit done. Factcheck Claim: There will be no border in the Irish Sea as a result of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Reality: The amount of friction in trade moving both ways across the Irish Sea is not wholly in the government\u2019s control, but will depend on negotiations with the EU. Friction on the trade route from Northern Ireland will also depend on WTO rules as well as measures introduced by the UK government. As a result, there is still a lot of work to be done before it is established how trade can and will operate between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Q: How will the UK be better off outside the EU? Johnson says the UK can have new rules on animal welfare, and new regulations on bio-science, and free ports. And it can control immigration, he says. Corbyn says, under his plans, manufacturing would be able to continue trading. He says many jobs have been lost. He repeats the point about a trade deal with the US taking seven years. Q: Why won\u2019t you say where you stand on Brexit. Is it because you don\u2019t know? Or because you won\u2019t say? Corbyn says it is because he has to bring people together. Johnson says you cannot end the uncertainty if you don\u2019t know what you want to do. It is a failure of leadership, he says. Q: You say you will get a trade deal done. But you don\u2019t have one yet? Johnson says he has a fantastic deal. Q: Not on trade. Johnson says he has ample time to negotiate a trade deal. Corbyn says Johnson will spend years negotiating with the US. And he has not been straightforward on the impact of the deal on Northern Ireland. He says the documents show there will be charges and restrictions on trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. Johnson says that is not true. The UK will come out as one. Johnson says it says \u201cunfettered access\u201d. Corbyn says the document does, but it also highlights things that would impact on trade. Johnson says he finds it a curiosity to be lectured on the union by someone who supported the IRA and Irish independence. Q: Johnson says you don\u2019t support the union. Corbyn says he has always supported a peace process in Northern Ireland. He pays tribute to the Labour government for achieving it. Q: Can you guarantee Brexit will happen next year? Q: How would Brexit make Britain better off? Corbyn explains his policy. Within three months, he will negotiate a new agreement, and then hold a referendum. As PM, Corbyn says his role would be to carry that out. No one voted to lose their job. Johnson says he is frustrated too. He will get it down by 31 January. Then he will be able to improve animal standards, cut VAT on tampons, have free ports and control immigration. He says he does not see who will negotiate the Labour deal. There is no one who will campaign for it. Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet backs remain. Corbyn says it will take seven years to negotiate a deal with the US. There could be delays at ports. Johnson says there would be a period of negotiation \u201cabout the mystery deal, led by someone we cannot identify\u201d. Parliament would spend a whole year more locked in debate about Brexit. Corbyn says Johnson will spend seven years negotiating with the US on access to our public services, access to our health services. He won\u2019t get a deal, so he will be left with nothing. Johnson rejects this. He says the UK will be able to take back control. Factcheck Claim: A Conservative government will recruit 20,000 more police officers and 50,000 more nurses. Reality: Two familiar lines from the Conservative offer in Johnson\u2019s opening. It\u2019s important to put the recruitment of 20,000 police officers into the context of the cuts over the last nine years, which saw around 21,000 cut. It\u2019s proposed that the officers will be recruited over the next three years - with 6,500 in the first year. As for the nurses, the Conservatives have confirmed that 50,000 target will include 20,000 retained nurses, who would have otherwise left the NHS - with no detail on how they will convince those nurses to stay. Q: Is Sir John Major\u2019s intervention worrying to you, Mr Johnson? And is Mr Blair\u2019s worrying to you, to Mr Corbyn? Will they make a difference? Or are they both has-beens? Johnson says he has the utmost respect for all former Tory leaders, but he does not think Major is right. He has a deal read to go, it is oven-ready. Unlike Major, he leads a party that is totally united. Because you got rid of people who did not agree with you, says Robinson. Johnson says it\u2019s because they agree with him. The mystery is Labour\u2019s position. Corbyn says the question is do we continue as we are, and have a Trump trade deal, or do we choose change. He says Blair and Major should consider the need for change. Q: Why can\u2019t Blair back you? Corbyn says he wants to change Britain. Q: People don\u2019t like either of you. Johnson says he will have massive investment, and take the country forward. Boris Johnson says next Thursday is a turning point. We can spread opportunity, and improve our services. But that will only happen with a Conservative government. If Labour gets in there will be chaos and two referendums. Jeremy Corbyn gives his opening statement. Labour is ambitious for the country, and for you. He wants a society where everyone is supported, and looked after in old age. Millions of people are struggling. They need an ambitious government on their side. A vote for Labour is a vote for real change. Nick Robinson starts by saying one of these men will be PM next week. Nick Robinson opens the debate. From Boris Johnson, or whoever runs his Twitter account From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley These are from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. From Jeremy Corbyn (or whoever runs his Twitter feed) Nick Robinson, the former BBC political editor who is now a Today programme presenter, is chairing the debate tonight. He posted this on Twitter earlier. From the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope Before the ITV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn last month, I posted what was in effect a five-point guide as to why TV debates don\u2019t tend to be as all-important as the broadcasters who host them sometimes suggest. If you missed it then, it all still applies. YouGov is going to release snap polling on who wins tonight\u2019s debate. In a press release the polling firm said: YouGov will be releasing a snap poll within minutes of the debate finishing at 9.30pm, revealing who viewers thought performed best out of Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn. During the ITV head-to-head debate, YouGov had results with a 1,500+ sample within 180 seconds of the debate finishing \u2013 the result showed a dead heat with 51% thinking Johnson won the debate while 49% thought Corbyn won ... YouGov will also be asking the public who performed best on the topics covered during the discussion and will be releasing characteristic ratings, such as who looked the most prime ministerial and who was the most trustworthy. As YouGov says, the poll immediately after the ITV debate two and a half weeks ago gave Boris Johnson a very narrow win. But about an hour later YouGov published more figures from the poll, and they gave a more nuanced picture. They suggested that while Johnson won on Brexit, being prime ministerial, being likeable and government spending, Corbyn won on being in touch with ordinary people, on the NHS, on being trustworthy and on other issues. And these figures also showed that more people thought Corbyn did well than thought Johnson did well. (That is paradoxical, but it may say something about expectations; there may have been people who thought Johnson won, but that Corbyn did better than they were expecting.) When the full tables (pdf) were published the following day, it also emerged that voters who had not yet decided how they would vote in the election clearly thought Corbyn was the winner. From the Labour South East account Michael Heseltine, the former Conservative deputy prime minister, also addressed the Stop the Brexit Landslide rally. This is how he wrapped up his speech. As a member of the Conservative party, as a foot soldier in its ranks through most of its recent battles, as a citizen proud of its achievements, I must put my country first. And the only way to revisit the Brexit dilemma is to vote first for the disenfranchised Conservatives, and then Liberal Democrat candidates and create a coalition of power. Only in that way can we clear the obstacle of Brexit and tackle the domestic agenda so long frustrated by the most divisive, corrosive, irrelevant political deviation of modern times. Jeremy Corbyn has arrived for the BBC debate in Maidstone, PoliticsHome\u2019s Alain Tolhurst reports. Here are the key points from Tony Blair\u2019s speech at the \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d rally in London. Some of the quotes were released in advance. (See 3.22pm.) Blair praised Sir John Major and other Conservatives supporting the \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d campaign. This is how he started his speech. Here are five words I never thought I would say: Thank God for John Major. To John, to Michael Heseltine, for years I stood against you. Tonight, it is an honour to stand with you. And to David Gauke and many others \u2013 good, smart, capable people across the political spectrum prepared to speak out, to put country before party and principle before position \u2013 your courage is an example. He said Brexit was a disaster, particularly for the young. Brexit is not a mistake, I wish it were, it is a disaster, a disaster our country cannot afford. And I say to those of my generation who voted for it, with age can come the wisdom of lived experience. But it is youth that has its finger on the beating pulse of the future and we have no right to steal that future from them. They know the world today works through connections, and Brexit breaks them. They see how success belongs to the open mind; Brexit closes that of their nation. They understand that their hopes will never prosper in the modern world without attachment to the hopes of their neighbours; Brexit throws those hopes on a bonfire of confusion, confusion between national pride and nationalism. He mocked the claims made by Brexiters in 2016. Remember when they promised that Britain\u2019s exit would be just the first, and once the rest of Europe saw the genius of our move, they would fall like dominoes. No other nation has followed, none will follow, and indeed there are nations to the east queuing to join. They promised a new trade deal would be easy, the Europeans battering our door down in surrender before the brilliance of our negotiating skill. Instead we are outside their door in anxious supplication. He said the DUP were \u201cprime witnesses\u201d to how Boris Johnson could not be trusted. When John Major and I warned the Irish border would create a dilemma between keeping the Good Friday agreement and undermining it, they derided us, promising the Irish cake would be had and eaten. And now the backstop is a front stop, we have not one border but two and the Democratic Unionists are prime witnesses to the dangers of trusting Boris Johnson. He said it was undemocratic to use a general election to resolve the Brexit issue. I will tell you what is undemocratic: mixing up Brexit with a general election. If Brexit is the question, ask us about Brexit. That is the democratic way. He said the Tories did not deserve a majority. Do not give Boris Johnson a majority, he does not deserve it. This Conservative party which now expels the likes of Michael Heseltine, disowns the statesmanship of John Major. A party whose chancellor, as of July this year, is now exiled in the wilderness for the temerity to say what he knows to be true, namely that a no-deal Brexit is a risk no responsible government would take. Such a Conservative party does not deserve to govern unchecked and the country would not be wise to let them. Some groan at the idea of a hung parliament. But better a parliament that\u2019s hung for want of a majority than a country hung for want of a leader. He urged people to vote tactically against the Tories. Its not one general election but 650 individual ones. There are great Labour candidates who deserve whole-hearted support. I am voting Labour. But let me put it this way: if you look, constituency by constituency, you will know the best candidates to back. Back them! He ended by saying this was the most important election of his lifetime. Six days to a decision of destiny. Six days to reclaim our future and shape it. Not in my lifetime, and maybe never again in yours, has there been a choice of such moment. So I beg you, I beg you with all my heart and all my mind, choose wisely. At the \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d rally in London the video message from John Major (see 2.52pm) has been played. And Tony Blair has finished his speech. As expected (see 3.22pm), Blair said that he personally would be voting Labour, but he urged people to vote tactically to stop Boris Johnson getting a majority, to create the possibility of a second referendum that could halt Brexit. Here are some lines from his speech. Downing Street has been forced to change its telephone switchboard message after a cabinet minister invited members of the public to ring up to find out the prime minister\u2019s diary details. As PA Media reports, Michael Gove told BBC Radio 5 Live listeners to call No 10 \u2013 and he read out the number \u2013 after being asked about the chances of Boris Johnson taking part in an interview with the corporation\u2019s veteran journalist Andrew Neil. Presenter Chris Warburton said: On a scale of one to 10, what\u2019s the chance of the Andrew Neil interview with Boris Johnson happening? Just give us a number? Gove replied: I think the number would be 0207 930 4433. That\u2019s the Downing Street number, and if you ring the prime minister\u2019s diary secretary, he will know, or she will know, what the prime minister is going to do. I am not the prime minister\u2019s diary secretary. As PA Media reports, No 10 has subsequently changed its pre-recorded switchboard message. Callers are now told: You have reached the Downing Street switchboard. Unfortunately we are unable to give out any information relating to the prime minister\u2019s diary on this phone line. To listen to further contact details, please press one. From the Financial Times\u2019 John Burn-Murdoch These are from Sky\u2019s Jason Farrell, who is covering the \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d rally in London. In many respects Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto is more radical than the one it proposed two years ago. But in at least one policy area there has been a minor retreat. In 2017 the manifesto (pdf) said Labour would consider the option of a land value tax. However critics attacked the idea as a \u201cgarden tax\u201d and in the 2019 version (pdf) this is just an option for commercial property. The manifesto says: A Labour government will review the option of a land value tax on commercial landlords as an alternative [to business rates]. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, was asked about this when he did a webchat with Mumsnet earlier today. This is what he said about the policy. We haven\u2019t put forward proposals on land tax but are encouraging a debate around land value taxation to ensure that, for example, when developments occur within an area, and individuals or companies benefit from those developments and their land values escalate, whether some of that value should be shared by the wider community. So I give the example in my own constituency, now that Crossrail is going through, paid for by public money, and land values are increasing fairly fast, local people are being squeezed out of being able to purchase a home in the area. One argument around land value taxation in these circumstances is that an element of the increased value going to corporations could assist in our local housing programme, providing benefits for the local people rather than, in some instances, overseas speculators. But there will be a full consultation in all our discussions on this. We will not be considering land value taxation on residential properties but on development land held by businesses and corporations. By a margin of five to one, voters do think Boris Johnson should agree to an interview with Andrew Neil, according to a YouGov poll. This is from the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. Andrew Neil said that if he got the chance to interview Boris Johnson he would want to ask a series of questions about trust. Johnson is frequently accused of being dishonest, and this afternoon a story from the US has provided a fresh example. According to a CNN scoop, the official in the British embassy in Washington responsible for matters relating to Brexit, Alexandra Hall Hall, has quit. Hall Hall was a career diplomat and CNN quotes from her resignation letter, which it says was widely circulated among diplomats. In it she said: I have been increasingly dismayed by the way in which our political leaders have tried to deliver Brexit, with reluctance to address honestly, even with our own citizens, the challenges and trade-offs which Brexit involves; the use of misleading or disingenuous arguments about the implications of the various options before us; and some behaviour towards our institutions, which, were it happening in another country, we would almost certainly, as diplomats, have received instructions to register our concern. It makes our job to promote democracy and the rule of law that much harder if we are not seen to be upholding these core values at home ... I am also at a stage in life where I would prefer to do something more rewarding with my time, than peddle half-truths on behalf of a government I do not trust. Here is more from the Conservative response to the Labour leak of the government document about how the PM\u2019s Brexit deal would affect Northern Ireland. (See 9.59am, 10.45am and 1.53pm.) This is what the party is saying in a briefing note for journalists. This leaked document is just an immediate assessment, not a detailed analysis of the deal, and misses key points. This document was produced immediately after the deal was struck and represents a \u2018flash analysis\u2019 of what the obligations of the protocol might be. It appears to have been based on a partial reading of the final deal. This document was not written for, and was not used for, decision-making purposes. This document has not been seen by the chancellor, the prime minister or any of the senior officials involved in the negotiations. The document contains a number of question marks which shows that it is an incomplete analysis. The paper does not highlight the power of the joint committee to address the issues that the paper identifies, or the power of key clauses to also address these issues. Here is the set for the BBC Boris Johnson/Jeremy Corbyn debate taking place tonight at 8.30pm in Maidstone, Kent. Peter Foster, the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, has a detailed and revealing Twitter thread on the leaked document about the impact of the PM\u2019s Brexit deal on Northern Ireland that starts here. And John Campbell, BBC Northern Ireland\u2019s economics and business editor, also has posted two good threads on the document. The first one starts here. And the second one starts here. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP chief whip and the candidate for Lagan Valley, has said the government document unveiled by Labour earlier (see 9.59am, 10.45am and 1.53pm) shows why Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal would be \u201cbad for Northern Ireland\u201d. In a statement he said: This latest leak from HMT is further demonstration that the prime minister\u2019s deal would be bad for Northern Ireland. The DUP warned the Prime Minister about this. Despite his protestations, the facts are in black and white. That is why we opposed the deal in the House of Commons and why Northern Ireland needs the deal changed. With polls narrowing in GB, we are urging voters to return a strong team of DUP MPs who will seek a better deal which works for every part of the United Kingdom. We have demonstrated over the last three years that we will stand up and speak up for Northern Ireland to ensure our economy is not decimated by a bad deal. Jeremy Corbyn is using this as a campaigning tool but no unionist will be tricked by his rhetoric. He has in the past and would in the future work in cahoots with those who want to destroy the union. Northern Ireland\u2019s best option is to elect a strong team of DUP MPs who will use their influence with the government. The former Labour prime minister Tony Blair is also due to speak at the \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d rally later this afternoon. We quoted some of his words earlier. (See 11.12am.) Like Sir John Major, he is also implying that people should vote tactically to stop Boris Johnson getting a majority, instead of just voting Labour. He will say: Do not give Boris Johnson a majority ... It\u2019s not Brexit that\u2019s getting done. We\u2019re getting done. This is the final chance for a final say. It\u2019s not one general election but 650 individual ones. Think long. Think hard. Time to choose. Choose wisely. At an event earlier in the campaign Blair said that he would be voting Labour personally, even though he could see why people might support the Lib Dem Chuka Umunna in his constituency. As a former party leader, he was in a special position, he explained. But he also said he did not want either of the main parties to form a majority govenrment. Here is a version of the video message from Sir John Major for the \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d rally taking place later today in London. Out with the SNP canvassers in East Dunbartonshire yesterday, I came across an interesting fact: 12,000 postal ballots had already been returned in that constituency by Thursday. Compare this with the total turnout in 2017 of 51,801. About 18% of the Scottish electorate are registered as postal voters, pretty similar to what it usually is for a general election, so no particular December surge as some predicted. But, with wintry weather forecast across Scotland next Thursday, it does make me wonder how much this election may be dominated by postal voters. The received wisdom is that postal voters tend to be older Tory women. But I\u2019ve been really struck by how many activists of all parties report that of those mortified by Boris Johnson\u2019s behaviour in the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg reclining on the benches and wotnot, it is older women who are most horrified. Anecdotally, I\u2019ve had lots of these conversations with older voters myself, and don\u2019t forget the Waspi (Women Against State Pensions Inequality) issue, which Johnson has not been convincing on. So does that make the postal voting constituency less predictable than usual? We\u2019re constantly being told that this is the most unpredictable election ever, so I suppose this is just one more factor to chuck into the mix. The Evening Standard, which is edited by the former Tory chancellor George Osborne, is also reading John Major\u2019s comments as a call for widespread tactical voting. (See 2.52pm.) I\u2019m told Major\u2019s office is not contesting this interpretation. We have already covered some of what Sir John Major, the former Conservative prime minister, is due to say to a rally this afternoon organised by Vote for a Final Say, a campaign being run by people who were involved in the People\u2019s Vote campaign until it imploded in infighting. (See 11.09am.) Major is formally endorsing three former Tories who are now running as independents because they had the whip withdrawn after voting to facilitate the Benn Act, the legislation that ruled out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. According to the news release issued in advance, he is backing David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton. Commenting on them, Major will say in a video message: Let me make one thing absolutely clear: none of them has left the Conservative party, the Conservative party has left them. Without such talent on its benches, parliament will be the poorer, which is why \u2013 if I were resident in any one of their constituencies \u2013 they would have my vote. But Major is also going to back calls for a second referendum. Addressing young people directly (the rally has been jointly organised with For Our Future\u2019s Sake, a second referendum campaign focusing on young people), he will describe Brexit as \u201cthe worst foreign policy decision in my lifetime\u201d. He will go on: It will affect nearly every single aspect of our lives for many decades to come. It will make our country poorer and weaker. It will hurt most those who have least. Never have the stakes been higher, especially for the young. Brexit may even break up our historic United Kingdom. And, making the case for a second referendum, he will say: When the nation voted on Brexit, they did so on a diet of fiction and undeliverable promises. As the facts become known, it is extraordinary that a new vote is denied: extraordinary and undemocratic. Your vote is absolutely crucial \u2013 for you have the longest lease on our country\u2019s future, and our place in the wider world \u2026 Don\u2019t wake up on Friday 13 December and regret not making a choice. So choose the future you believe in \u2013 for your own generation and the next. According to the news release, Major will say tribal loyalty to a party has its place. But he will also say that no single party has a monopoly on wisdom, and that: Sometimes you need to vote with your head and your heart for your country and your future ... This is such a time. Like most political parties, the Conservative party has rules saying members are not allowed to endorse other parties at a general election and, from the way the news release is worded, it sounds as if Major wants to avoid anything that would lead to him being thrown out of the party he used to lead. But it is impossible to read these words without concluding that he wants people to vote tactically to deny Johnson a majority. If overturning Brexit is the priority (and the rally is called \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d), then that could only happen if Jeremy Corbyn were to form a government and hold a referendum, or another party were to make a referendum a condition of supporting a minority Tory government. This is from David Merritt, whose son Jack was killed in the London Bridge terror attack last week. Boris Johnson has cancelled a visit to Rochester at the last minute, PA Media reports. He was due to give a stump speech to Tory supporters near Ye Arrow pub. A small number of protesters also arrived holding signs that read \u201cTories out\u201d, \u201cAusterity killed over 130,000, the blood is on your hands\u201d and \u201cNo to racism, no to Boris Johnson\u201d. A decision was taken to cancel the visit and the Conservatives claimed it was because of \u201clogistical reasons\u201d. In his lunchtime Brexit election briefing email, the Financial Times\u2019s James Blitz assesses whether Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to agree to an interview with Andrew Neil will make any difference. Probably not, he thinks. He explains: Opinion pollsters I\u2019ve spoken to this morning are united in saying this row is a less serious problem for Mr Johnson than his opponents think. They offer three broad reasons. First, people will view this row through the prism of their pre-existing support. Voters who dislike Mr Johnson think he is being cowardly. People who warm to him think it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue at the margins,\u201d said Ben Page, head of Ipsos Mori. \u201cThe people it excites are people who already don\u2019t like him.\u201d Second, the fact that Mr Johnson is appearing in a BBC head-to-head debate with Mr Corbyn tonight helps neutralise the damage. \u201cBack in the 2017 election campaign, Theresa May refused to debate head-on with Corbyn and that undermined her claim to be a strong leader,\u201d said Marcus Roberts, a former Labour strategist now at YouGov. \u201cMany voters will see Johnson debating Corbyn this evening and wonder what the fuss is about Andrew Neil.\u201d A third factor that should not be ignored is that this is a row that helps the Tories. The party is 10 points ahead of Labour in the polls. By filling the airwaves with lots of headlines about what is fundamentally an issue of process, they stop Labour getting on the front foot on issues that really could affect the election, like the state of the National Health Service and public services. In other words, this row suits the Conservatives\u2019 defensive election strategy. A senior government source said the document produced by Labour about the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal on trade with Northern Ireland (see 9.59am and 10.45am) was an \u201cinitial appraisal\u201d compiled by junior civil servants that had not been signed off at a senior level. The Conservative party said the document had been produced immediately after Johnson\u2019s deal was struck and was not written, or used, for decision-making purposes. They pointed to a number of question marks in the document, which they said showed it was an incomplete analysis. They added that the deal was fully compliant with the Belfast/Good Friday agreement. Thanks for all your questions Our political team will answer any questions you have about the election on Monday at 12.30pm. You can ask your question via our form here. Q: As a northern Labour voter, I think the patronising way in which it is being reported that northern Brexiters will vote Tory for the first time as they are hoodwinked by Brexit is being massively overblown. Everyone I know is voting Labour. What do you think the realistic chances are of the Tories or Brexit party gaining in the north? Lewie Magarshack, 31, small business worker, South Yorkshire If we take \u201cthe north\u201d in its greatest sense then I think there\u2019s a chance that Barrow and Grimsby might go Tory. Ashfield perhaps too, although the flooding may not play in the prime minister\u2019s favour. I have also heard from Labour MPs campaigning in Yorkshire mining communities that they are hearing people go Tory for the first time. It\u2019s an anecdote but an interesting one. On the other hand, it also seems very likely that the Labour vote holds in ultra-marginals because the Brexit party may shave a few thousand off the Tory vote. Q: What chance does the Brexit party have of winning any seat and continuing to function as a party if the conservatives win the GE? Jonathan, 22, games designer, Sheffield It\u2019s difficult to see that they have a realistic chance of winning any seat. Early on, there was hope in Hartlepool, which is why the party\u2019s most senior figure after Farage, Richard Tice, decided to run in that seat. But people on the ground there say they think they will even struggle to get the vote out at all, let alone get a surge for one particular party over another. This does appear to be a recurring theme \u2013 people who just don\u2019t have the desire to vote at all. They do have elected councillors and MEPs under the Brexit party name so it is expected that the party will have to continue in some format. Good Afternoon. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Sarah Marsh. I will be here for the rest of the day, covering the debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn on BBC One at 8.30pm. This is what Labour is saying about Boris Johnson\u2019s suggestion that turning down an interview with Andrew Neil was like turning down an interview with Lord Buckethead. Incidentally, it is worth pointing out that Johnson\u2019s quote (see 12.25pm), particularly when read alongside the briefing we have had from CCHQ about the apparent flaws with the extended interview format (see 9.45am - it is a self-serving view, not shared by most journalists, who value the extended interview format), effectively amount to a confirmation that he won\u2019t do the interview. Only yesterday he was not formally ruling it out. Just under 15 minutes left to ask any questions you may have on the Brexit party. Send them in to us here. Q: As the Brexit party appears to be filling the void for people disillusioned with politics in general, why are they not proposing more radical reforms to the current system? Will they pick up many votes from \u201cnon-voters\u201d? Tee, 32, Bristol They are proposing reform to the voting system by looking at more proportional methods and by introducing citizens\u2019 initiatives to allow people to call referendums if there are 5 million registered voter signatures. This proposal for direct democracy is a highly unusual addition to government, particularly for the UK, although something similar exists in Switzerland. It could be possible they pick up the vote of typical \u201cnon-voters\u201d. Certainly on the doorsteps people have said the only time they ever voted in their lives was for leave in the EU referendum. This might work in the Brexit party\u2019s favour at the ballot box. Q: Is covering the Brexit party as soul-crushingly depressing as it sounds? Tom, Lewisham No not at all! It\u2019s been really fascinating to see how Farage still operates after 25 years in politics and if his message cuts through. He is a performer and seems to really animate the audiences he assembles around him. Although these gatherings are a tenth of the size of some of the rallies he did earlier in the year. The most interesting thing is that many of the party\u2019s candidates are from Labour families who have turned their back on that party because they feel it no longer represents the working class. Their inability to support Jeremy Corbyn comes up in most of the seats I have visited. You have been sending in your questions about the Brexit party which I will be answering until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Q: Does the Brexit party mind what kind of Brexit we get? Milly McEwen, retired, Deal Farage has repeatedly talked of a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d, or, in reality, a different way of saying \u201chard Brexit\u201d. This was understood to mean leaving the single market and customs union and working with other countries on World Trade Organisation terms. Crucially, it also means having no political alignment with the EU. He has now said he will accept Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal because the prime minister has promised to try to negotiate a \u201csuper Canada-plus\u201d free trade agreement with the EU, and also to not extend the transition period beyond the end of 2020. In the Canada model, 98% of all tariffs on goods traded between Canada and the EU are duty free. Canadian importers do not have to pay around \u00a3529m in taxes on goods imported from the EU and European importers have a zero tariff on 9,000 Canadian goods. Q: Does the Brexit party support Johnson\u2019s deal or is it a capitulation to the EU? John Hibs, Glasgow They do now support Johnson\u2019s deal, although Farage says it is far from perfect. He did initially have significant problems with it, saying it was a sellout and, as you say John, a capitulation to the EU. This is because he said it would not get Brexit done and meant up to three years of negotiations and difficulty in achieving true free trade deals. There would also be continued regulatory alignment in social policy and environmental law. \u201cIt is not Brexit!\u201d he shouted on 4 November to members. By 11 November he said he could tolerate it because he was putting country before party. Q: Why did Mr Farage decide not run for a seat at this election? If he loses his seat as an EU MEP how can he be Brexit party leader? Maud, 46, scientist, London He decided not to run himself as an MP because he said he would be better served darting around the country giving speeches in marginal seats day after day. Sticking to one place geographically during the campaign might not have helped spread his message to the north of England, Wales and Midlands, he has said. Had he stood this would have been his eighth attempt to get into parliament. You can be leader of a political party without having an elected position in Westminster, like Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP. He does continue to have his seat as an MEP but has said he has no idea what the future holds after this general election. There are rumours that he might work more in the US. Q: Will the Brexit party cease to exist if and when the UK exits the EU? Andrew, 39, public servant, Glasgow They have sought to explain they are a party of wider political reform and have a life beyond Brexit which is why abolishing the House of Lords, scrapping postal voting and looking at new voting systems is all part of their offer. However the name is a bit of an issue. Farage said in the last week that he might need to change it to the Reform party. But yes, it\u2019s possible their initial reason to exist may at some point disappear. James Cleverly, the Conservative party chairman, said: Once again, Jeremy Corbyn is brandishing leaked documents that don\u2019t back up his wild conspiracy theories. This is just another desperate attempt to distract from his refusal to take a position on the biggest issue of the day. He simply cannot be trusted. He won\u2019t honour the result of the first referendum and now wants to fiddle a second referendum by changing the rules and allowing millions of EU nationals to cast ballots too. Labour have been exposed \u2013 they are planning to rig our whole democracy in a desperate bid to force us to stay in the EU. The Conservatives have negotiated a great new deal with the EU which takes the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland, out of the EU. The choice is clear: Corbyn\u2019s Labour, with a gridlocked hung parliament and the chaos of two more referendums, or a majority Conservative government that will end the uncertainty, get Brexit done and unleash Britain\u2019s potential. Some of your questions so far have been about funding and the party\u2019s policies: Q: Who funds the Brexit Party? Matt, 23, civil engineer, Leeds They are funded by donors, some of whom used to give money to the Tories, and also by the public. Businessman Jeremy Hosking is one such donor and he gave them \u00a3250,000 in November. In August of this year the Electoral Commission reported they had taken \u00a31 million in donations. To become a registered supporter there is a \u00a325 joining fee and \u00a3100-a-month club for members. They also run a pretty expansive merchandise website, with Brexit party T-shirts and baseball caps. During the general election they have charged \u00a32.50 for people to attend their rallies. The Electoral Commission has asked them to review how they take donations as they were using Paypal, which risked cash being sent from abroad. Q: What other policies do they have, besides Brexit? Paul, 47, company director, Merseyside Farage does not talk about himself as having prime ministerial ambition, it appears he wants to operate in parliament by holding the leader to account over Brexit and ensuring it is delivered. He believes even a small number of Brexit party MPs could have a huge impact on votes and legislation in the Commons, similar to the way the DUP had a grip over parliament. This election he has talked about scrapping the House of Lords, voter reform, a points based immigration system, ending the export of British waste to developing countries, and planting millions of trees. I\u2019m Kate Proctor, a political correspondent for the Guardian, and I will be answering your questions on the Brexit party today. I have been following Nigel Farage and his party around Labour heartland seats in the North of England, Wales and Midlands during the general election campaign. I have covered politics for six years, locally and nationally, and arrived in the lobby at Westminster the day after Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour party. Before joining the Guardian I worked for the Evening Standard for three years as their political reporter, and was the Yorkshire Post\u2019s political correspondent. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. Speaking at a Conservative campaign event at Kent showground near Maidstone, Johnson defended his decision not to submit himself to an interview by the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. \u201cI think most people would say I\u2019m the only prime minister to have done not one but, tonight, two head-to-head debates, I\u2019ve done 118 sit-down interviews with journalists, fielded innumerable questions at press conferences,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot accommodate everyone. There\u2019s a guy called Lord Buckethead who wants to have a head-to-head debate. Unfortunately I am not able to fit him in. We can\u2019t do absolutely everything.\u201d Johnson was also asked about former prime minister John Major\u2019s criticisms of his administration. \u201cI think it\u2019s very sad and I think he\u2019s wrong. He represents a view that is outdated, alas.\u201d Johnson said he respected Major and his record. \u201cI must respectfully disagree with my illustrious predecessor and urge people on Thursday, come on, let\u2019s get this thing done.\u201d Channel 4 has apologised after subtitles below a speech made by Boris Johnson suggested he said he wanted democratic control over the migration of \u201cpeople of colour\u201d. It said: \u201cBoris Johnson says \u2018people of talent\u2019 not \u2018people of colour\u2019. Our earlier tweet was a mistake. We misheard and we apologise.\u201d A senior Tory source said: This shows why it has been impossible to cooperate with Channel 4 News. They are campaigners in this election, inventing the most damaging things possible to further their campaign against Brexit. This sort of thing is why so many media organisations have collapsing audiences. We sadly do not expect the senior management at Channel 4 to take this terrible mistake seriously and we expect more of the same. Jeremy Corbyn was asked by Channel 4\u2019s political correspondent, Liz Bates, whether he thinks Labour would fare better among working-class voters with a different leader. He replied: \u201cI think Marmite\u2019s really good for you. Some people like it and some people don\u2019t. I lead the party and I\u2019m proud to lead the party.\u201d The Labour leader has produced a leaked report on Northern Ireland and customs checks, describing it as \u201ccold, hard evidence\u201d that Boris Johnson has been misleading people about his Brexit deal. Corbyn revealed the confidential document, titled Northern Ireland Protocol: Unfettered Access to the UK Internal Market, at a press conference in central London on Friday. Ask our experts a question As part of a new series you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and they will post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until election day. Today, Kate Proctor, a political correspondent for the Guardian, will answer your questions about the Brexit party. You can ask your question via our form here. At a Conservative campaign event at Kent showground near Maidstone, Boris Johnson was asked about the documents. (See 10.45am.) He insisted it is \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d to suggest his Brexit deal would lead to customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He said: I haven\u2019t seen the document you\u2019re referring to but that\u2019s complete nonsense, and what I can tell you is that with the deal that we have we can come out as one whole UK. He said voters should believe him when he says there will be no checks on goods going between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \u201cThey should believe exactly what I say, which is that there will be no goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland or from Northern Ireland to Great Britain because we are going to come out of the EU whole and entire, and that was the objective that we secured.\u201d Channel 4 has issued an apology after subtitles below a speech made by Boris Johnson suggested he said he wanted democratic control over the migration of \u201cpeople of colour\u201d. It said: \u201cBoris Johnson says \u2018people of talent\u2019 not \u2018people of colour\u2019. Our earlier tweet was a mistake. We misheard and we apologise.\u201d Footage of the leader speaking on Friday was put on Twitter with the subtitles. It sparked social media fury after it was believed Johnson said: \u201cI am in favour of having people of colour come to this country but I think we should have it democratically controlled.\u201d But the audio from the clip suggests he in fact refers to \u201cpeople of talent\u201d. Even the leader of the Scottish National party, Nicola Sturgeon, responded. In a tweet, now deleted, she said: \u201cAnd the Tories claim that their obsession with immigration is nothing to do with race. This is a shocking \u2013 and very revealing \u2013 comment.\u201d Nigel Farage had been billed to speak at a Brexit party defence rally in Westminster but failed to show up. A party spokesman said Farage felt his presence would be a \u201cdistraction\u201d at the event, following the resignations of four Brexit party MEPs. They walked out on Thursday to back Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. \u201cThis was an event about defence but if Nigel was here every question would have been about the defections,\u201d the spokesman said. Ann Widdecombe, the party\u2019s defence spokeswoman, led the speeches at the rally, pushing for Britain to leave the \u201cEuropean defence union\u201d after Brexit and strengthen ties with Nato. The Ulster Unionist party appears to trust Jeremy Corbyn rather than Boris Johnson over the Labour leader\u2019s leaked Treasury document stating that there will be a border down the Irish Sea between Britain and Northern Ireland. Steve Aiken, the former submarine commander and now UUP chief, said the material Corbyn was given proved that the Brexit withdrawal agreement would have \u201cruinous consequences for Northern Ireland\u201d. Johnson has insisted his agreement would not lead to customs checks between Britain and the region. Aiken said the information contained in the leak \u201ccomes as no surprise as our analysis of the withdrawal agreement since it first appeared in December 2017 was this was would be the inevitably grim consequences for Northern Ireland\u201d. The UUP leader said: \u201cThe fact that this identifies that Northern Ireland\u2019s SMEs will be likely to struggle to bear the cost should set alarm bells bringing in all sections of the business community and beyond.\u201d Aiken claimed the Boris Johnson withdrawal agreement puts the region \u201con the brink of being torn away from our biggest market (UK) with totally ruinous consequences\u201d. Boris Johnson has unveiled a new election poster in a visit to Kent. It declares: \u201cGet Britain out of neutral.\u201d The poster does not state which gear the Conservatives want to put Britain in but it shows a choice of gears. Channel 4 has apologised, saying Boris Johnson said \u201cpeople of talent\u201d and not \u201cpeople of colour\u201d. They said he had been misquoted. A lot of people expressed their concern at reports of Boris Johnson\u2019s comments on immigration, after it was alleged he said: \u201cI\u2019m in favour of people of colour coming to this country but I think we should have it democratically controlled.\u201d However, Channel 4 News later apologised saying it had misheard him and the prime minister had actually said: \u201cI\u2019m in favour of people of talent coming to this country.\u201d The leader of the Scottish National party, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted about the incident but has since removed it. The former labour prime minister Tony Blair will also speak at a rally in London demanding a second EU referendum. Blair will say: \u201cThis Conservative party which now expels the likes of Michael Heseltine, disowns the statesmanship of John Major, a party whose chancellor as of July this year is now exiled in the wilderness for the temerity to say what he knows to be true, namely that a no-deal Brexit is a risk no responsible government would take, such a Conservative party does not deserve to govern unchecked and the country would not be wise to let them. \u201cIt\u2019s not Brexit that\u2019s getting done. We\u2019re getting done. This is the final chance for a final say. It\u2019s not one general election but 650 individual ones. Think long. Think hard. Time to choose. Choose wisely.\u201d The former Conservative prime minister John Major is expected to urge voters to back rebel candidates running against Boris Johnson in the general election. In a video message, Major will describe Brexit as \u201cthe worst foreign policy decision in my lifetime\u201d. He will say that \u201cit will make our country poorer and weaker and \u201churt most those who have least\u201d. The comments come at the Stop the Brexit Landslide rally organised by campaigners who want to stop Boris Johnson. Other people attending include the former Labour prime minister Tony Blair. Major\u2019s message will endorse three former ministers \u2013 David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton \u2013 who he says are \u201cprincipled decent human beings\u201d. They are all running against Tory candidates. Jeremy Corbyn was asked by Channel 4\u2019s political correspondent, Liz Bates, whether he thinks Labour would fare better among working-class voters with a different leader. He replied: \u201cI think Marmite\u2019s really good for you. Some people like it and some people don\u2019t. I lead the party and I\u2019m proud to lead the party. \u201cAs prime minister, I want to bring our country together. I could reply in lots of ways but I believe personal abuse and personal attacks demean and lower politics, so I never reply. That\u2019s how it is with me, I\u2019ve got a jar of Marmite in my cupboard to prove it.\u201d He said he feels like he could be in the world of Alice In Wonderland, with facts becoming \u201ca little bit elusive\u201d in the election thanks to the prime minister. \u201cHence we have made this document available today,\u201d the Labour leader said. Boris Johnson visited a bakery in Golders Green, north London, on Friday morning. He tweeted: The Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has shared a document marked \u201cofficial sensitive\u201d that he says shows Boris Johnson has been \u201cmisleading\u201d the public on his Brexit deal. See pages from it below: A press conference is about to begin with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. Corbyn said the report claimed Mr Johnson\u2019s deal would be \u201chighly disruptive to the Northern Irish economy\u201d. \u201cIt says this deal will be the equivalent of imposing tariffs on 30% of all purchases made in Northern Ireland,\u201d he said. The Labour leader also said the report warns of the potential for fraud, saying Northern Ireland could become a \u201cbackdoor into the GB market for the avoidance of import duties\u201d. The BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that the document was not \u201csurprising or secret\u201d but that some of it had been \u201cadmitted under duress by ministers\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, tweeted: Labour\u2019s shadow secretary of state for Brexit, Keir Starmer, has tweeted about a leaked report showing Johnson is \u2018misleading people\u2019 about his Brexit deal. Watch footage of broadcaster Andrew Neil calling for Boris Johnson to be interviewed by him. Corbyn claimed the document \u201cdrives a coach and horses through the Prime Minister\u2019s claim that there will be, in his words, no border in the Irish Sea\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not true,\u201d the Labour leader said. \u201cJohnson\u2019s deal will be disastrous for businesses and jobs all across the UK, and the Government\u2019s confidential report confirms this.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn has produced a leaked report on Northern Ireland and customs checks, saying it is \u201ccold hard evidence\u201d that Boris Johnson had been \u201cmisleading\u201d people about his Brexit deal. The confidential document, entitled Northern Ireland Protocol: Unfettered Access to the UK Internal Market, was revealed at a press conference in central London. The Labour leader said it was proof there would be customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit. \u201cWhat we have here is a confidential report by Johnson\u2019s own government, marked official, sensitive, that exposes the falsehoods that Boris Johnson has been putting forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is cold, hard evidence that categorically shows the impact a damaging Brexit deal would have on large parts of our country.\u201d Corbyn said Johnson claims there will be \u201cno border in the Irish Sea\u201d but that \u201cis simply not true\u201d. He brings forward a report, marked \u201cofficial sensitive\u201d and says it shows that Johnson\u2019s deal will be \u201chighly disruptive\u201d for Northern Ireland. \u201cHigh street goods are likely to increase in price, which is likely to affect business profitability. If that is how Johnson defines a good deal for Northern Ireland, what has he got in store for rest of us?\u201d The Labour leader highlighted page 9 of the report, which says Johnson\u2019s \u201cdamaging deal may have a significant effect on the economies of Scotland and Wales\u201d. He said that the government was hiding this information and described the document as \u201cominous\u201d. Corbyn said: \u201cWhat we have here is a confidential report by Johnson\u2019s own government \u2013 marked official sensitive \u2013 that exposes falsehoods Boris Johnson put forward. It is cold, hard evidence that shows the impact a damaging Brexit deal will have on large parts of our country.\u201d A senior Conservative source has claimed the public are \u201cfed up\u201d with TV interviews that are \u201call about the interviewer\u201d. It comes after veteran broadcaster Andrew Neil called on Boris Johnson to face him in an interview. The Tory candidate for prime minister has refused to do an interview on Neil\u2019s BBC show. \u201cThe public are fed up with interviews that are all about the interviewer and endless interruptions,\u201d said the source. \u201cThe format is broken and needs to change if it is to start engaging and informing the public again. \u201cThe PM will focus on talking to voters about people\u2019s priorities including investing in our NHS and helping with the cost of living.\u201d Labour Party politician, David Lammy, tweeted: The Transport Salaried Staffs\u2019 Association (TSSA), which represents 540 station staff, condemned a Tory candidate for undermining RMT\u2019s South Western Railway strike \u201cfor his own political benefit\u201d. Chris Loder, who is standing in Oliver Letwin\u2019s West Dorset seat, boasted on his website that he was volunteering as a guard to keep the trains running. But he said nothing about his role as head of new trains with South Western Railways, responsible for driving through the new driver only trains at the heart of the dispute. TSSA leader Manuel Cortes said \u201cThe truth is there was a deal on the table that was acceptable to the RMT but it was pulled by South Western Railway at the last minute \u2013 most likely to give Loder the chance to further his political career while causing misery to passengers. \u201cThis is nothing more than a callous, cynical and disingenuous stunt by a former union member who\u2019s turned strike breaker to further his political career. \u201cIf Loder genuinely cared about passengers, he would support the RMT\u2019s efforts to protect safety. Instead this Tory candidate is now involved in undermining the strike for his own political benefit. A decade of \u201csavage\u201d austerity cuts to local authorities has led to the closure of vital public services, a new study suggests. Children\u2019s centres, libraries, bus routes and toilets are among areas affected, according to research that showed the impact of huge reductions in council funding. A series of Freedom of Information (FoI) requests by the union across England, Scotland and Wales examined the changes in local services between 2010 and 2019 for several council services. The report said cuts have led to a 17% fall in council spending on local services in England since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Today\u2019s front pages: The Guardian Today, we report on the rising toll of measles with nearly 10m cases and 142 deaths. Veteran broadcaster Neil\u2019s call for Johnson to be interviews also appears on the front page, which can be viewed here.

Financial Times The front looks at how Saudi Aramco $25.6B breaks initial public offering (IPO) record. Here is a link to it. i The focus on the frons is that it is \u201ccrunch time\u201d for Corbyn as it is reported that he makes last-ditch appeal to voters. A selection of more front pages The BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg has tweeted: She added: \u201cNot sure the very healthy viewing figures for the interviews quite back that up\u201d. A YouGov poll for the Times, published overnight, suggests that the Scottish National Party (SNP) will continue to dominate the Scottish political landscape after the election, with support for the nationalists up at 44% \u2013 higher than it has been at any point during the election campaign and up seven points on the 2017 general election result. Support for the Scottish Conservatives has increased eight points from August to 28%, a revival of their fortunes after the slump that followed Johnson\u2019s election to party leader but not enough to save five MPs. Seat projections from the poll see the SNP up from 35 to 46, Tories down from 13 to 8, the Lib Dems sticking at 4 and Labour losing all but one of their 7 Mps. While these findings could have a significant impact on the prospect of a Corbyn minority government, it\u2019s worth remembering just how marginal many of the seats in Scotland are, with a week of campaigning left. Analysing the results, polling guru John Curtice noted that while the SNP have managed to cross the Brexit divide and largely keep their Leave voters, they have also won Remain supporters from opponents. \u201cSouth of the border Labour has been able to advance during the campaign by winning back Remain voters from the Liberal Democrats. However, in Scotland the SNP dominates the Remain vote \u2014 more than half (54 per cent) of Remainers support the party, a figure that shows no sign of diminishing. Labour, on 16 per cent, is simply left to share the crumbs with the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.\u201d A Conservative candidate has said disabled people should be paid less as \u201cthey don\u2019t understand money\u201d. Sally-Ann Hart, the candidate for Hastings and Rye, was met with hostility from an audience and she defended sharing an article that suggested paying disabled people less. On EU citizens being able to vote in a potential future Brexit referendum, Long-Bailey added: \u201cI think it\u2019s right.\u201d She said: \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to ensure that those people have the opportunity to vote over their future, because essentially this isn\u2019t just about the future of people who were born here, it\u2019s about the future of people who contribute to our economy and have done for a very, very long time.\u201d The Economist has endorsed the Liberal Democrats in its final edition before the election. Rebecca-Long Bailey also discussed the Jewish Labour Movement\u2019s submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), saying that some of the comments in it were \u201cshocking\u201d. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Long-Bailey said: \u201cI haven\u2019t looked at it, no. I\u2019ve certainly seen media reports. \u201cAnd what I\u2019d say is, I mean some of the comments that I\u2019ve seen in the press have been absolutely shocking and the Labour party would never under any circumstances condone any antisemitic behaviour in the way that\u2019s been outlined in that report.\u201d She added that the Labour party \u201cdid not deal with the problem quickly enough when it was first presented\u201d but that now they have \u201csped up our processes\u201d and have a \u201cmore robust regime\u201d in place. Long-Bailey continued: \u201cSome of the comments that I\u2019ve certainly read about the way members have been treated, it\u2019s absolutely horrifying, and if they\u2019ve been treated that way by members of the Labour party then people who were in the Labour party certainly shouldn\u2019t be members of the Labour party \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d She added: \u201cBut there\u2019s still further to go, and as a party who\u2019s been proud to stand up against racism and antisemitism and all forms of discrimination, we want to have the gold standard. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to listen and look at the report and the comments that have been made and to very, very carefully consider and act upon any recommendations that the EHRC make.\u201d Labour\u2019s Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, spoke on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. She said: \u201cMany businesses need support ... before they have made their profits and don\u2019t feel they receive that support.\u201d Long-Bailey said Labour had released a 20-point plan to reform the business rates system to make it \u201cfairer for smaller businesses to operate.\u201d She added: \u201cWe will scrap quarterly reporting for companies with a turnover under \u00a385,000.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Jim Waterson explores the reality of how smartphones turned election news into chaos. Groundbreaking research gives snapshot of a world in which politics coverage is warped by social media algorithms and friendship groups. At least four ministers have gone on election campaigning trips to endorse Tory candidates facing allegations of Islamophobia since the claims against them came to light, the Guardian has learned. Read the full article here. Michael Gove has said allowing EU citizens to vote in another Brexit referendum would go against the principle of democratic fairness. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: There\u2019s a basic principle of democratic fairness. It is the case that EU nationals don\u2019t vote, have never voted, in general elections, and therefore don\u2019t vote, have never voted in referendums like the Brexit referendum \u2013 and, therefore, we just think it would be unfair. It\u2019s a bit like a rugby league final, 13 players on either side. If one team suddenly said we\u2019re going to play rugby union instead and bring two extra players on to the field, that simply wouldn\u2019t be fair. He added that he understands Labour\u2019s argument but that it is \u201cfundamentally an assault on the basic democratic principle\u201d. What makes it worse, I think, to fair-minded observers is the idea that the referendum next time round, if the Labour party were to come into power, would be run according to different rules, and rules that every objective observer says would be more likely to favour remain. Nick Robinson, who will lead a head-to-head TV debate between Corbyn and Johnson, said on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cDebates can be frustrating, interviews are limiting \u2026 Let\u2019s hope [politicians] do more interviews next week.\u201d He said head-to-heads such as this \u201clet us see the two men most likely to be in Downing Street \u2026 properly debate\u201d. A lot of the newspapers today lead on a dossier on antisemitism in the Labour party. The Jewish Labour Movement\u2019s submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission \u2013 which is investigating the party \u2013 was leaked. Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, gave up his place on the BBC Question Time panel last night after it was pointed out that it would be an all-male panel. Anneliese Dodds took up the position instead. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, has said four politicians who quit to back the Conservatives had been plotting against him ever since Johnson took over as leader. He pointed out that Annunziata Rees-Mogg was related to cabinet minister Jacob, and claimed another of the defectors was a \u201cpersonal friend\u201d of the prime minister. The broadcaster Andrew Neil laid out a challenge for Boris Johnson to commit to an interview with him. He said: \u201cIt is not too late. We have an interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at today\u2019s front pages: On Friday evening, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will face the Conservative leader, Boris Johnson, for the last time before election night. The pair will go head to head in an hour-long BBC debate in Kent. With only one week to go before voters go to the polls, it\u2019s seen as a last attempt for both candidates to secure votes and sway those yet undecided on who to back. The debate will be chaired by the BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Nick Robinson. It begins at 8.30pm, wth Corbyn giving the first 60-second opening statement. Questions will come from the audience. Suggestions have also submitted through the BBC website. Robinson has vowed to \u201climit the time [the candidates] spend delivering \u2018oven ready\u2019 soundbites\u201d. Former Labour and Conservative prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major are expected to appear via video link to headline a \u201cFinal Say\u201d rally on Friday. The event has been set up to stop Boris Johnson getting into power and will feature the former Conservative deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine, the journalist Ayesha Hazarika, and radio presenter James O\u2019Brien. Data analytics firm YouGov is conducting a snap poll and will declare the winner at 9.30pm live on Sky News. Corbyn has invited journalists to a press conference on Friday morning in central London, commencing at 9.30am. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, will visit a playgroup in Hampshire to promote the party\u2019s plans to increase childcare funding for disadvantaged children aged three and four. Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, will launch the party\u2019s small business manifesto in Bolton at 9.30am. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s politics live blog.
