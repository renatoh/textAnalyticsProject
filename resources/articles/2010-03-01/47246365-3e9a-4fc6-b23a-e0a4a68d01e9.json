It was to be his only tangible reward from a night when City's credentials as a top-four side were exposed as fundamentally flawed by ruthless, relentless Everton. A first home league defeat of the season, the failure to usurp Tottenham in fourth place and, on the other side of the coin, another step forward on Everton's impressive late surge were all overshadowed by the stoppage-time incident that saw Mancini barge into Moyes and go eyeball to eyeball with the imposing Scot. And he twice came back for more. A possible FA charge awaits while psychologists consider whether the Italian's over-reaction is a sign of unbearable pressure. The immediate hysterics should not disguise from City's failings, however. Blunt in attack despite dominating possession, and vulnerable in defence whenever tested, this was not a performance to promote an application to the European elite. Everton were found wanting on neither score. \"What you should be talking about was the performance of Everton tonight,\" said Moyes, who was sent to the stands with Mancini by the referee Peter Walton. \"Spirit, quality football - that should be the only talking point.\" He has a point. In fact, with 29 from the last 39 available, the Everton manager has more than enough to resent a start to the season that was ruined by injury and, as he claimed once again last night, City's protracted summer pursuit of Joleon Lescott. This may have been a result to unite both halves of Merseyside, but Liverpool will not savour what is coming up given their current form. It should not escape Moyes, or City, that Everton's textbook away victory was based on the pillars of John Heitinga and Sylvain Distin, two men bought with the proceeds of Lescott's sale. Combined with the flair and penetration of Tim Cahill and Mikel Arteta, who scored well-worked team goals in either half, the visitors possessed the ingenuity and solidity City lacked. With Manchester United, Arsenal, Villa and Tottenham to come for Mancini's team, they need to find both qualities fast. There was needle to accompany the incentive to this occasion even before the managers' tete-a-tete. Three former United players in the Everton ranks, Moyes' pre-match claim that City do not have the collective spirit he has engendered at Goodison Park, and a commanding Everton win when the sides last met in January made for a volatile atmosphere. Completing the explosive brew was the referee, whose laudable attempt to allow the game to flow unfortunately left him open to accusations of inconsistency - particularly from the home crowd and Mancini - once the yellow cards began to appear. Not that all the complaints were wrong, however, with Heitinga's challenge from behind on Stephen Ireland forcing the increasingly influential Irishman out of the game and signalling the end of City's dominant first-half spell. Tim Howard, the Everton goalkeeper, saved from Micah Richards, Carlos Tevez, who was booked for diving head-first into Phil Jagielka's leg as the defender cleared his lines, Craig Bellamy and Tevez once more as City's pressure appeared to be heading towards a breakthrough. Predictably, the team under siege got it. Walton infuriated the home ranks when he awarded Everton a dangerous free-kick on the left of the City area after a nudge by Gareth Barry on Cahill. Everton's prowess in such situations is well established and despite the seven sky-blue shirts packing the six-yard box, they produced once more, Arteta rolling a short pass square to Leighton Baines, whose driven cross was glanced home by Cahill. City were distracted by their own frustrations. Mancini brandished an imaginary card as Steven Pienaar escaped a booking for exacting revenge on Richards, a classless act that drew a furious response from Moyes, while Shay Given sprinted into Everton's half to demand similar punishment for Arteta when the Spaniard also failed to merit a mention in Walton's book. Given was rewarded for his 80-yard dash with a booking of his own. Of greater concern for Mancini was his side's inability to turn sustained pressure into openings. Indeed it was Everton who presented the greater danger and five minutes from time, with an exquisite move, they made victory secure. Jack Rodwell spun away from Vincent Kompany and had the presence of mind to pick out Cahill as he surged into the area. The Australian dummied, and Arteta arrived from behind to place a low right-foot shot through Given's grasp.
