A whole new meaning to the Great North Run. RETURNING HERO It was good to see Paul O\u2019Connell in the BBC\u2019s studio in Paris, five days after being forced to retire from the game. He got his montage and was an excellent analyst. Toulon\u2019s loss is punditry\u2019s gain. LOSING STREAKS OF THE DAY 9: The number of consecutive Six Nations matches lost by Scotland since their win in Rome in February 2014. 9: The number of consecutive Scotland defeats at the Millennium Stadium since Gordon Bulloch\u2019s tries sealed a 2002 win. Hot bonus fact: With four wins over Italy and two over Ireland you have to go back to March 2008 to Scotland\u2019s last Six Nations win over a team not beginning with I, when they beat England 15-9 at Murrayfield. BEST FADING For the second time in a week, Ireland led a match at half-time but could not hold on for the win. Last Sunday they converted a 13-10 lead over Wales into a 16-16 draw; on Saturday their 9-3 lead was overhauled by France with 10 minutes to go. MOST MISERABLE Anyone taking a train from a very busy Cardiff Central after a Wales game. Next up: a match against France a week on Friday that\u2019s due to finish at 10pm. Goody. HISTORY REPEATING During their World Cup win over France, Ireland lost Johnny Sexton and a towering lock \u2013 Paul O\u2019Connell \u2013 to injury. This time both Sexton and O\u2019Connell\u2019s replacement, Mike McCarthy, went off. Unlike the Cardiff classic last autumn, though, Ireland did not emerge victorious. PRINCIPALITY WATCH The people of Wales are quite clear on the matter \u2013 Wales is not a principality, hasn\u2019t been one since 1542, and woe betide anyone who says it is. Welcome, then, the Principality Stadium in a 10-year naming deal with a building society. Bravo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
