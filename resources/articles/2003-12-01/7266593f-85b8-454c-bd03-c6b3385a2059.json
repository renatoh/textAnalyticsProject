Ferguson entered the debate as United's lawyers announced they had requested from the Football Association a written explanation for the reasons behind its ban. It means United will have a fortnight to appeal from the day the FA's explanation arrives. It is arguable which will annoy the FA the most - what it is likely to see as an unnecessary request from Old Trafford, or the inflam matory nature of Ferguson's comments. \"We've got to support him [in an appeal] because there's absolutely no evidence at all,\" said United's manager. \"We're going to get a lot of criticism for it but we're entitled to support someone we feel is innocent and that's the nub of the matter.\" Ferguson praised Ferdi nand for his performances during the most turbulent chapter of his career: \"It's not easy for him. You wonder what's under the surface, whether he's ready to break and how much the strain is affecting him. He's shown great character to get on with his life. He was wrong not to go in there [for the test]. But he knows he's innocent.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
