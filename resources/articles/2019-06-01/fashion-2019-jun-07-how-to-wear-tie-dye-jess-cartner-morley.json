So, for that reason, I was planning to sit out the tie-dye trend, to be honest. Am I alone in this? Do you often get out of the shower and think: \u201cUgh, I am absolutely sick to the back teeth of looking so polished all the time, what I need are clothes that will make me look messier.\u201d Do you? Is that a thing? I don\u2019t think so. And yet here I am. Because tie-dye is everywhere you look this summer, to the point of being unignorable \u2013 unless we want to spend the summer blindfolded, which feels like an overreaction. So rather than just pretend tie-dye isn\u2019t happening and then end up making a misguided market-stall purchase on holiday, the grownup thing to do is to face tie-dye head on, which is what I\u2019m doing here. Tie-dye mostly comes as T-shirts, or all-over vest dresses, or as fray-hem denim shorts. Which is because tie-dye is associated with being ultra laidback to the point of horizontal, as discussed. But there is another way to do tie-dye, which pivots it back to respectable, and that is by wearing it in a slightly smarter format. A tie-dye shirt, like the one I\u2019m wearing here, with a pair of favourite old jeans of mine that you\u2019ve seen before, is a genuinely wearable summer option. A cotton shirt makes a great warm-weather top \u2013 crisp, breezy, smart without being constricting \u2013 but most shirts have an office-appropriate vibe that means you end up looking like you\u2019re on your lunch break, which isn\u2019t how I want to feel or look at the weekend. Note the sandals. I really like these shoes but I probably wouldn\u2019t wear them with the sort of pretty summer dress they feel like they were intended for. A pretty summer dress and a high, bare pink sandal is a bit too straight-up dressy. I love a fancy frock with a flat sandal, and I love a snazzy shoe with jeans and a plain white T-shirt. And it turns out, I\u2019m quite into a dressy shoe with denim and tie-dye, too. The shoes bring the tie-dye up a notch; the tie-dye stops the shoes looking prim or proper. Tie-dye isn\u2019t all about mess, it turns out. Sometimes it\u2019s the smart option. \u2022 Jess wears tie-dye shirt, \u00a3145 by D\u2019ascoli from matchesfashion.com. Jeans, Jess\u2019s own.
