Two Dutch research projects tried to take that measure. They hoped to confront the spectre of death - to either confirm or disprove the worry that good whisky and sacred candles, singly or in combination, are very, very bad for a body. The very specific object to be measured, both in the booze and in the candle smoke, was a particular group of chemicals. Known by the acronym \"Pahs\" (say it aloud, with pursed lips, to see how disgustingly nasty some people think they are) - these tasty, smelly molecules have a fairly well-deserved reputation for causing cancer and other illnesses. Jos Kleinjans, an environmental health professor at the University of Maastricht, led a pair of inquisitions. He joined with one bunch of colleagues to give whisky a good going-over. With a different bunch, he sniffed into church candle (and also church incense) fumes, in search of insidious inner nastiness. The whisky came first. As detailed in a report published in 1996 in the Lancet, Kleinjans and five friends obtained some of the finest whiskies on earth. For comparative purposes, they also picked up some of the cheap stuff. From Scotland they got six malts - Laphroaig, Oban, Glenkinchie, Glenfiddich, Highland Park and Glenmorangie - and also four blends - Famous Grouse, Chivas Regal, Johnnie Walker Red and Ballantines. From North America, five bourbons - Southern Comfort, Virginia Gentleman, Jack Daniel's, Four Roses and Old Overholt. From Ireland, three whiskies - Bushmill's Malt, Jameson and Tullamore Dew. \"Carcinogenic Pahs,\" the scientists announced, \"were present in all whisky brands\" but \"it is apparent that Scotch malts have the highest carcinogenic potential\". Eye-pokingly, they revealed that the most expensive Scotch malts contain the highest levels of danger. No worries, though. The report concludes that: \"Compared with smoked and char-broiled food products ... Pah concentrations in whiskies are low, and are not likely to explain the cancer risks of whisky consumption. This is danger with a tiny \"d\". It is the spice of life, and also of whisky. An almost-biblical seven years later, Kleinjans and three other friends published a report called Radicals in the Church. It tells of their adventures in a Roman Catholic church - the Onze Lieve Vrouwe Basiliek in Maastricht. There they sampled the fumes from a standard nine-hour session of burning candles and incense. They also, literally for good measure, sampled the air before and after what they call a \"simulated service\" in a large basilica. The Pah levels, they discovered, are higher than in a dose of whisky, but perhaps not high enough to shed clear light on the question \"Is it dangerous?\". And so their report ends with a murky diagnosis: \"It cannot be excluded that regular exposure to candle- or incense-derived particulate matter results in increased risk of lung cancer or other pulmonary diseases.\" Marc Abrahams is editor of the Annals of Improbable Research (www.improbable.com) and organiser of the Ig Nobel Prize"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
