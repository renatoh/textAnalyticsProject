The Dow closed up 342 points or 3% at 11,215, with the percentage rise matched by the Nasdaq composite index. Along with the Federal Reserve's half-point cut in interest rates on Tuesday, sentiment in New York appears to have been influenced by lower than expected US inflation figures for April, and by unexpected strength in the housing market."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
