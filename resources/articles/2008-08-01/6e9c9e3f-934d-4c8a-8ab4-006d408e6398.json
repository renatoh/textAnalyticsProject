But what they lack in glamorous titles they make up in blood and marital connections to Barack Obama. Today is unofficial family day in Denver, and instead of political luminaries and grandees of the party, the show will be dominated by the candidate's wife, brother-in-law and half-sister. Top of the billing will be Michelle Obama, with the build-up to her headline speech this evening provided by her brother, Craig Robinson, and Barack's half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng. There is nothing new in playing the family card at conventions - Tipper Gore spoke in support of her husband, Al, in 2000, John Kerry's daughter Alexandra was rolled out in 2004, and Laura Bush stumped for George on both occasions - but for family to dominate the first day's proceedings in this way is unusual. \"Family is shaping the content of the entire day, and that's not been done before,\" said Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University. The first of the three on stage will be Soetoro-Ng, who teaches in a school in Hawaii. Aged 38, she is nine years younger than Barack. They have the same mother, the late Ann Dunham. Soetoro-Ng is likely to talk about how Barack filled in as a father figure in her life after her parents divorced when she was nine. \"He let me know the world was large, and that I should get to know as much of it as possible,\" she said recently. Then it will be over to Robinson, who will introduce his sister, Michelle Obama. Two years her elder, he has been relatively sparingly used by the Democratic campaign so far but his charisma and engaging smile is expected to be highly televisual. More importantly, he also represents a story that the Obama campaign is keen to highlight throughout the week - that the senator for Illinois and his immediate family have got to where they are today through their own hard work rather than through birth or privilege. \"Craig is an example of the classic American dream,\" says John Rogers, a Chicago businessman who played basketball with Robinson at Princeton University. Rogers points out that Robinson, like his sister, rose from modest beginnings in a four-room bungalow on Chicago's South Side to professional success - in his case as coach for Oregon State university's basketball team. That theme of honest graft appeals to the Obama campaign as a stick with which to beat the Republican opponent, John McCain, whose wealth was largely acquired through his wife Cindy's inheritance. \"They want to contrast the story of Obama, who has been through struggles that many Americans are now facing, with McCain, who seems increasingly out of touch,\" said Mark Mellman, a top strategist for Kerry in his 2004 presidential run. It was Robinson's achievement in getting to Princeton that gave his sister the inspiration to follow in his footsteps. Her stint at Princeton led on to Harvard Law School and then to a Chicago law firm, Sidley and Austin, where she met her future husband. Michelle Obama's speech this evening, timed for maximum TV exposure, will be the highlight of the day but also carries the highest stakes. In the run-up to the convention, the attacks on her have gathered in intensity. Typical of the genre is The Obama Nation, a new book by Dr Jerome Corsi, who four years ago was a leading proponent of the swift boat attack on John Kerry, which sought to undermine the Democratic candidate's record as a Vietnam war hero. Corsi follows the by-now well-trailed portrayal of Michelle Obama as an angry black woman. He dwells on her Princeton thesis on race relations, with its references to the writings of black radical Stokely Carmichael - a connection first made by the British writer Christopher Hitchens - and reminds readers of her gaffe when she talked about being really proud of her country for the \"first time in my adult lifetime\". Corsi concludes that she is a bitter person \"filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the United States\". Such assaults are increasingly vexing for the Obamas. In a recent Marie Claire interview, Barack Obama decried the caricature of his wife as an angry person and said \"She's the most quintessentially American person I know.\" The use of the term \"American\" is pointed. The official title of today's events is One Nation, and through the week the Democrats will seek to present the Obamas as a mainstream American family - no different from any other ordinary American household. It is a picture that crucially is neutral on race - an area that Obama has been consistently keen to keep out of the debate as much as possible. In the run-up to the convention, the campaign has tried to shift Michelle's public image towards the more homely one of housewife and mother. She has appeared on daytime chat shows and talked in interviews about the struggle of juggling work and kids, and Tyra Banks of America's Next Top Model poses as her on the cover of September's Harper's Bazaar, along with an Obama lookalike. \"The challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen. The question is whether she is willing to go along with that,\" Schiller said. Jerry Kellman came to know Michelle in the early days of her relationship with Obama. He predicts that she will prove herself to be a huge asset when she steps on to the stage: \"She is bright and she is gifted, but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that American voters will respond to.\" Kellman will himself be on stage in Denver today, as the man who in 1985 gave Obama his first job as a community organiser in Chicago, on a salary of $10,000 a year. In his speech, he hopes to \"make people aware of the kind of sacrifice Barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope\". A similar tone can be expected in a feature film made for the convention by Davis Guggenheim, who directed Al Gore's Oscar-winning movie An Inconventient Truth about global warming. Edward Kennedy will also address the floor for five minutes by video link from his home in Massachusetts, where he is receiving treatment for a malignant brain tumour. One of the most interesting aspects of the emphasis on family today is who will not be present. The most poignant absence will be that of Madelyn Dunham, or Toot as Obama calls her, his maternal grandmother, who lives in Hawaii, but who at 85 is said to be in fragile health. Absent too will be George Obama, Barack's half-brother and the youngest child of Barack Senior, the Kenyan economist who was briefly married to Ann Dunham while living in Hawaii as an overseas student. George, aged 25, was last week tracked down by the Italian edition of Vanity Fair living in a 6ft by 9ft shack on the outskirts of Nairobi. He told the magazine that he was so ashamed of his impoverished circumstances, living on less than a dollar a month, that he never mentions the fact that his half-brother could soon become the most powerful person on earth. \u00b7 This article was amended on Wednesday August 27 2008. Tipper Gore (not Tippa, as we said in the article above) spoke in support of her husband, Al, at the 2000 Democratic convention. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
