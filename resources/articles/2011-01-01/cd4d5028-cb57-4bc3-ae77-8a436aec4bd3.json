So when I say that I am fearful for the future of maternity services, I do not say this easily. When I say there is a real danger that recent progress in improving the experience of childbirth for women is coming to an abrupt halt, and may even go into reverse, I do not say so to grab headlines. It is evident to me that the pressures facing maternity services \u2013 a historically high birthrate, increasingly complex pregnancies and births, staff shortages \u2013 are not going away and that, indeed, we are on the edge of our capacity to cope. Large maternity units have always experienced days that are extremely busy, and when the number of midwives on duty is lower than the numbers of women needing care, but these used to be the exception. Our members are now telling us that these very busy days are the norm. Midwives cannot carry on working like this day in and day out and continue to practise safely. I visited a maternity service recently where community midwives are regularly called in to help out on hospital labour wards, instead of being free to concentrate on their work in GPs' surgeries and in people's homes. Midwives tell me they are unable to give the time to women that they need in the postnatal period because of the relentless demands of the labour ward. Only last month a midwifery professor told me that midwives were getting used to working conditions that were actually unsafe. Despite assurances that the drive for financial efficiency will not be met by kneejerk cuts, we all know, and can all see in our local communities, that many NHS trusts are preparing to take a scythe to the services they offer. This assault is the result of a combination of factors. The increase in the birthrate has not been matched by a rise in midwifery numbers. Britain's pregnant population now has more older, more obese and more very young mothers than ever before, as well as an increasing number of patients with serious medical and social needs. Midwives are called upon to give advice on issues ranging from smoking and weight loss, to immunisation and swine flu, as well as being alert to the possibility of domestic violence in the families they are caring for and dealing with potential child-protection issues. This is all in addition to their regular duties. Expectations are high and yet efficiencies are expected. I do not argue from an ivory tower. I travel around the country meeting midwives and my worries are theirs. They are deeply anxious about the care being delivered. They believe that the service they are giving to women and babies is deteriorating, and that safety is too often being compromised. The service is teetering on the brink; the cracks are beginning to appear. I talked recently to three heads of midwifery. All were worrying about the latest Care Quality Commission survey of women's experience of maternity care. Yes, the headline finding of significant satisfaction among women was good, but that masked very negative comments about poor postnatal care and the fact that one-to-one care in labour from a midwife was a long way from being achieved. The last government oversaw extra funding for maternity services and an increase in midwife numbers. Welcome as that was, it was and still is not enough. Over the past decade, the birthrate has increased by 19%, yet midwife numbers have increased by just 12%, at least 3,500 short of the number needed to deliver a safe, high-quality service. Yet, despite this disturbing picture, the prime minister has reneged on his personal, pre-election pledge to increase the number of midwives. They are \"crucial to making a mum's experience of birth as good as it can possibly be, but today they are overworked and demoralised\". Not my words but those of David Cameron, in a national newspaper, a year ago. In the same article he pledged to increase the number of midwives by 3,000. Despite persistent requests from us for his government to honour this pledge, it will not. The government has also said it is committed to maintaining the number of student midwives in training. What is the point, however, if there are no jobs for them? The government's backtracking does not just relate to midwife numbers, it also extends to commissioning maternity care. The original policy was that it would be done separately from commissioning of other NHS services, an idea supported by us along with such bodies as the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. We all believed it to be a forward-thinking policy that would bring greater benefit to mothers and babies. We now know that maternity commissioning will, in fact, fall within the remit of GP consortia. I am deeply disappointed about this U-turn on one of the more innovative proposals in the NHS white paper. This may seem like dry policy discussion but it matters because its outcome will dictate the quality and safety of service that women and their babies will receive. This government is committed to higher-quality, women-centred care, committed to choice, committed to public health. Why is it therefore backtracking on its own policy ideas on maternity commissioning? Why is it reorganising the very structures that were, in our view, delivering the changes it wishes to see? Despite the fact that midwifery-led care, if developed, would be the key to pulling significant costs out of the current maternity services, the government has frozen midwives' pay and is now attacking their annual pay increments and their modest NHS pensions. And if this were not enough, this is all going on when frontline staff are increasingly concerned that they cannot provide basic and safe maternity services, far less high-quality services. Be in no doubt, the coming years are going to be difficult ones for women and families and for the midwives who care for them. Services will regress as the demands remain high, and resources stagnate, or even fall. I hope I am proven wrong. Is there time for a rethink? I, for one, hope so.
