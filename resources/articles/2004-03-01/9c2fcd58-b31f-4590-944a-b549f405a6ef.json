On Saturday the chairman Theo Paphitis was again forced to go out to bat for his club, on this occasion following allegations of racism levelled at the Millwall fans by the Burnley manager Stan Ternant. The Burnley left-back Mo Camara had been roundly booed by the home fans after an incident during the FA Cup game between these sides two weeks ago, when the Guinean clashed with Millwall's defender Matt Lawrence. \"The crowd abused Mo again, which I think is scandalous really,\" said Ternant. \"I feel very sorry for Theo and the Millwall people because they are trying extremely hard to eradicate it and there is no place for that sort of behaviour. \"I didn't mention it in the FA Cup game because it may have seemed sour grapes but I think those people should be surrounded and locked up. \"I don't mind if they want to boo him - that's OK. The monkey chants were here in the FA Cup the same as today. That is racist in my book.\" But an angry Paphitis, seated only a few yards from the Burnley manager during the game, was quick to rebut the allegations. \"Burnley lost - it was a fair game and they lost 2-0. That is it, it's a game of football,\" he said. \"But to try and mix it, because you lost, with racism is beneath contempt because it is such a serious issue. \"The police didn't see it, I didn't see it, no one else saw it, so Stan's got tremendous ears obviously. The player got booed and he'll get booed again. I'm certainly not going to criticise our crowd for that.\" For Paphitis the frustration must be close to unbearable. Following the riots that marred Millwall's exit from the play-offs in 2002, the club cracked down heavily on antisocial behaviour at the New Den at great financial cost. A membership scheme was introduced and away fans were banned from some matches - measures that saw Millwall's arrest figures fall last season. Microphones are also used in all the stands. The club could certainly not be accused of being unprepared to combat racism or of being unaware of the issue and on Saturday there were no monkey chants audible from the press box. The booing was keen but not unusually so for an opposition player returning to the scene of his perceived crime, though members of the press present at the Cup meeting remain divided as to whether Camara was subjected to racist abuse during that game. The police match commander in charge two weeks ago did not report any racist abuse. Nevertheless extra measures were taken in reaction to reports of racism that appeared in several newspapers. \"In view of the allegations made after the Cup tie, we had additional resources including plainclothes in all the stands,\" said Ken Chapman, the chief of security at the New Den. \"All we have reports of [today] is persistent booing.\" Camara was non-committal. \"I don't care about the Millwall fans,\" he said. \"I'm just doing my job. Maybe it's not because I am black. Maybe it is because they do not like me as a person.\" Paphitis said: \"We work our nuts off to deal with what we consider to be an incredibly serious issue in society - racism. We do more than any other football club. We work harder than anyone else and all we get is nonsense.\" It would be a shame if the issue was allowed to overshadow a successful period for the club. A workmanlike victory here, which lifted them into fifth place, came when the impressive Paul Ifill calmly rounded the Burnley keeper Brian Jensen to open the scoring and then crossed sweetly for Peter Sweeney to slide home the second. Tranmere visit the New Den next weekend to battle for a place in the FA Cup semi-finals.
