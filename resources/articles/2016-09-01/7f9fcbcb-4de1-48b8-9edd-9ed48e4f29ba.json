In an interview on Sky News on Tuesday Conroy defended his policy legacy in media reform. Conroy resigned from the Senate on Thursday evening, tabling a speech explaining that he did so for family reasons. When the news broke on Friday it caught the acting Labor leader, Tanya Plibersek, by surprise mid-press conference. On Sky on Tuesday, Conroy said he had \u201capologised profusely\u201d to Plibersek. \u201cI have to say I am embarrassed about poor Tanya \u2013she\u2019s a very dear friend of mine and I did embarrass her,\u201d he said. Conroy explained that the other senior figure in the Labor left, Anthony Albanese, knew of his resignation because he had told him during a conversation about Labor\u2019s national executive and the appointment of its next secretary. He said he had informed Shorten by text message because the Labor leader was in Canada at the time. Conroy said he hadn\u2019t known Plibersek was holding a press conference but hetook \u201cfull responsibility\u201d. Asked whether his resignation could weaken Shorten\u2019s leadership, he said: \u201cThere are a whole range of people that have got Bill Shorten\u2019s back. \u201cDon Farrell is a passionate Bill Shorten supporter and has been for a long period of time \u2026 And Richard Marles will be working within the Victorian group along with David Feeney and a whole group of other people.\u201d Farrell is in the box seat to replace Conroy as deputy Senate leader despite his history of tension with Labor\u2019s current Senate leader, Penny Wong. Reflecting on his policy legacy, Conroy conceded he had \u201cmade some mistakes along the way\u201d but trusted his impact was on the whole positive. He defended failed media law reforms, rejecting the characterisation that Labor had attacked free speech when it proposed the creation of public interest media advocate to oversee media mergers and the Press Council. \u201cI still believe that Press Council is a fairly irrelevant organisation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has improved but due to the pressure that there could be some regulatory reform.\u201d Asked whether he was or had ever been a global warming sceptic, Conroy replied: \u201cI\u2019ve always said publicly that I think humans are affecting the temperature and there\u2019s a big scientific debate about how much \u2013 that\u2019s always been part of the debate.\u201d Reflecting on advice he would give a young person considering entering politics, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I could put my hand on my heart and say go for it \u2013 because it\u2019s a pretty tough, fierce media environment. \u201cThat\u2019s a little sad. Being in politics is a noble profession. You can make a difference \u2013 I\u2019d like to think I made a difference. \u201cIt is getting harder and harder, with the rise of right and leftwing extremists and the demands of the media cycle \u2013 even when there\u2019s not much happening you\u2019ve got to make it sound like something\u2019s happening.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
