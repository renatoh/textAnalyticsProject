Local rescuers, helped by US and French emergency response teams, managed to extract only a handful of survivors from the wreckage of College La Promesse. The collapse killed nearly 100 children and teachers and injured almost 150 more. Attention remains fixed on Haiti's schools in the wake of another school collapse yesterday in Port-au-Prince. What is especially noteworthy, however, is how the story captured hearts and headlines around the world. Over 4,000 wire stories were filed in several days, and in record time, foreign governments and international organisations channeled millions of dollars of aid and in-kind assistance through dozens of charities and government programmes. The international response to this particular catastrophe is striking in Haiti, which over the last several years has seen storms, floods, political violence and quieter tragedies like hunger and disease claim tens of thousands of lives and livelihoods. If the sad story of College La Promesse is to have a silver lining, however, we can hope that these tragic scenes bring more attention to the less visible disaster of Haiti's education system, which suffers from the same endemic problems that brought down College La Promesse: short-term thinking and a lack of expertise and oversight. The lost opportunity for a decent and dignified life for most of Haiti's youth is not so easily reconstructed. To be sure, most Haitians across the country are denied access to any kind of quality education. The results (pdf) are both predictable and depressing. Haiti has both the lowest literacy rate and the lowest performing overall education system in our hemisphere. Haiti's public schools educate roughly 5% of the school-aged population, leaving most Haitians, who subsist on less than two dollars a day, to pay for a sub-standard service that we consider a birthright. Not surprisingly, less than 10% graduate from high school and only an elite 1% enroll in university. We believe that a game-changing investment in Haiti's education system is the single greatest measure that the international community could undertake to help move the country onto a more promising path. This would entail not only a substantial reform in the existing education structure but also enabling Haiti to create capacity where none currently exists. More and better school houses will be worth little if the students who attend them aren't learning anything. Haiti's current government has shown a willingness to tackle the daunting problems, but with an education budget of only $83m, or less than $70 per student, success depends on sustained attention from the international community. Haiti needs the international community \u2013 most critically, the US \u2013 to translate its short-term sympathy into a long-term partnership. This must include both financial flows to meet basic budgetary and infrastructure needs as well as incentives for better oversight, establishment of standards and learning measurements, improved and innovative teacher training and relevant vocational programmes. America's overarching, long-term goal should be to help Haiti move sustainably toward providing a free and decent education for every child. Haiti's short-term tragedies show no signs of letting up, and the international community will be called upon again to provide the bandages. Nonetheless, if we are able to look ahead, and if we are able to muster as much attention, care and help on the victims of Haiti's failed school system as we have on the victims of College La Promesse, we can look forward to replacing images of bloodied school children and grieving parents with smiling graduates and beaming families building a more solid future for themselves and their country.
