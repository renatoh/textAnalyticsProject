Unification of the rivals, we were told, would secure a defensible base for a business that once upon a time was the giant of British retailing. It also sounded like an outbreak of common sense from an organisation buoyed up by its earlier, devastating demolition of the upstart takeover attempt by Andrew Regan. Corner shops might not be glamorous, but the Co-op would concentrate again on serving its local communities. The Alldays chain was added in 2002 and the Co-op, now with 1,800 outlets, looked a decent second-tier player. Then came yesterday's little shocker. The key attraction of corner shops as businesses is meant to be their predictability: even in the age of the all-conquering Tesco, nobody wants to travel far just for a pint of semi-skimmed and 20 Bensons. But yesterday's \u00a345.6m fall in six-month profits to \u00a3135m indicates the Co-op found a way to shoot itself in the foot. At least it is honest about the fact. Its own execution, rather than increased competition, was the primary cause, it said. That is a better response than that of Sainsbury's, which has taken the best part of five years to admit the full horrors within its distribution network. It suggests recovery may also come more quickly to the Co-op than Sainsbury's. Thus and minus The two share price charts here are for the same company, \"alternative\" telecoms supplier Thus. But they cover different time horizons. The first, running from the company's demerger from Scottish Power in 1999 to the present, illustrates the wild optimism with which companies such as Thus were viewed during the Great Millennium Bubble. The second, covering the past three years, shows how - even after five years of analysis - the investment community still struggles to work out whether these putative competitors to British Telecom will ever succeed. Shares in Thus fell by a quarter yesterday, with holders stung by another gloomy warning on profits. On the five-year chart that move doesn't even show as a blip. On the three-year chart it shows how the minor renaissance of Thus has been so thoroughly undone. In short, Thus and its rivals - firms such as Energis, Colt and Cable &amp; Wireless - are tearing each other to pieces with overly competitive pricing in a saturated market for leased lines and other corporate telephony services. Meanwhile, their clients are increasingly moving their telecoms for data on to cheap and cheerful internet protocol services, further eroding the ability of firms like Thus to claim that the service they offer carries any sort of premium. What's more, it can only be a matter of time before substantial amounts of voice traffic begin to switch to IP as well. Over-capacity in corporate telecoms is as great as ever and, short of someone digging the roads up and saw ing through the cables, it is difficult to see when the situation may ease. Through Demon, which was one of the first internet service providers, Thus also has exposure to the smaller business sector. But here, again, customers are upgrading their technology (from dial-up to broadband) and the result is more pressure on Thus's margins. It may be that the only thing enabling executives from this hard-pressed sector to get out of bed each morning is the prospect that at some stage these forces are going to start eating away at BT's margins in a similarly painful way. That, or perhaps they are still hoping that someone will come along and act as prime consolidator - vacuuming up all of the alternative suppliers in the hope of creating some sort of truly viable alternative to BT. In fact, it is becoming increasingly clear that a consolidator may be the only thing that can get this industry out of its trough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
