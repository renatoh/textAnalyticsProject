It was almost cloying. The managers were inseparable, enjoying the luck of the draw and later joshing with generosity. \"It's brilliant,\" said Barnet's John Still. \"If we lose the replay,\" said Roddy Collins, \"I'll be sad, but glad for John.\" And back in March Carlisle's 1-0 victory here was crucial in saving their status and sending Barnet out of the league. But times and teams have changed. Barnet started with five of the same men, Carlisle three. Last spring Collins was doing the double with Bohemians before a fall-out with the Dublin club. In July Still was putting in a good word to help him get the Carlisle job. He is a boxing fan and was a mate first of Collins's brother Steve, the former world super-middleweight champion. Barnet have adjusted well to the Conference, lying fifth but falling short of break-even crowds. They cannot get back into the league on capacity, let alone level playing field, and have contingency plans with Leyton Orient if they finish top. Recent hopes of expansion on to land at the bottom end have run into a row over relocating Barnet cricket club. Carlisle have taken up their customary position, equal last on points. Their league survival is a matter of legend, dependent two seasons ago on a keeper of questionable eligibility scoring in the 92nd minute on the last day. Last week they were trying Vinnie Jones but he looks happier now with Hollywood at his feet rather than a football. They could have done with a smoking barrel or two. When Collins took over he said: \"I know I can be successful if I put my head down and graft.\" His midfield followed suit. If they had looked up, they might have served their strikers better. They barely landed a shot. Barnet had plenty in a lightweight contest that saw Barnet employing the jab, left or right according to which wing Mark Gower was on. He set up all that was best for the better side. But this was very much an under-card at Underhill. The rematch, with a trip to Tranmere at stake, at least will get a punchline. Man of the match: Mark Gower (Barnet)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
