The Conservatives won City of Chester by 2,583. In Chesterfield, on the other hand, Labour came 549 votes ahead of the Lib Dems (8 May, page 8). \u2022\u2008Surveying local-election outcomes, a piece said that in Liverpool, Labour last held power under Derek Hatton, a reference to the city's deputy council leader disqualified from office along with several colleagues in 1987, after a ruling by the law lords. In fact, Labour last held power on the city's council for much of 1995-98 under Frank Prendergast. The article also said Labour had seized Sheffield council from the Liberal Democrats. Not quite: Labour's three-seat gain has indeed ended the Lib Dems' majority, but no party has control (Fightback has to begin at local level, says Labour, 8 May, page 20). \u2022\u2008There were three slips on a national results map headed How the UK looks now. In England's north-west, Hazel Grove was shown as a Conservative gain from the Liberal Democrats, whereas the latter actually held it by 6,371 votes; and Rochdale was shown as a Labour hold when it was a Labour win from the Lib Dems by 889 votes. In Greater London, Finchley and Golders Green was shown as a Tory hold, whereas it was a Tory win from Labour (8 May, pages 6-7, How Britain Voted election supplement). \u2022\u2008Blaenau Gwent should have been described as held by an independent candidate since 2005, not 2006 (Tories celebrate gains as Plaid hopes for hung parliament role, 8 May, page 17)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
