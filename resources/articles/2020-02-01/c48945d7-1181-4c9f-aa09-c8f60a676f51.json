Critics say the government\u2019s choice to lead on the climate emergency has previously seemed a somewhat half-hearted environmentalist, the new attorney general has taken a dim view of the courts and the international development secretary appears to have questioned the value of international aid. Alok Sharma As president of the crunch UN Cop26 climate talks to be hosted by the UK this November, Sharma has a critical role. Yet he showed little interest in the climate emergency before taking over as secretary for international development last July. He has used the term \u201cclimate\u201d only six times in parliament, and on only two of those occasions did he have anything substantive to say about the crisis. A Guardian analysis showed he voted only twice in favour of climate protection in 13 votes on the issue. Campaigners are also concerned that his dual role as business secretary will make him beholden to powerful vested interests. However, he did urge the World Bank last October to devote more funding to the climate. Suella Braverman The new attorney general has often seemed at odds with the courts. She supported the proroguing of parliament, which was later ruled illegal by the supreme court. In an article last year, she defended the prime minister\u2019s controversial move. She said: \u201cThey [remainers] say that proroguing parliament is thwarting democracy \u2026 They argue that Boris Johnson is stopping MPs from holding the government to account. That\u2019s hypocritical \u2026 What the \u2018Outrage Brigade\u2019 has failed to mention during its angry five minutes on air is that parliament was already going to be away on recess for party conferences for three weeks.\u201d In a comment piece on the Conservative Home website last month, she accused the courts of exercising \u201ca form of political power\u201d. She said that while the Human Rights Act was \u201cnoble in its intentions\u201d, \u201cthe concept of \u2018fundamental\u2019 human rights has been stretched beyond recognition\u201d. Anne-Marie Trevelyan The new international development secretary has raised questions about the value of international aid. In 2012 \u2013 three years before she became MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed \u2013 she replied to a tweet from DfID saying: \u201cNo one in Africa should go hungry,\u201d by saying: \u201cNor in the UK. There r kids in NE who have no regular meals due to chaotic parents. Should they go hungry?\u201d A year later, she tweeted about an article by the Conservative donor Michael Ashcroft calling for an end to the guaranteed aid budget of 0.7% of gross national income (GNI), saying: \u201cInteresting article by Lord Ashcroft on the value (or otherwise) of the overseas aid budget,\u201d ending with \u201c#charitybeginsathome\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
