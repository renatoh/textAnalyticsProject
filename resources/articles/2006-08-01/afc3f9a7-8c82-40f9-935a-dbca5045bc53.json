It's a conservatory cum garden room and it's totally beautiful. I like the proportions. It's quite dainty in a way and it has a lovely view of the garden. But it was a long time coming because I wanted an office above it and there are a lot of rules and regulations about building two-storey extensions in this area. We bought the house 10 years ago after the previous owner, Connie, died. She had a bric-a-brac stall on Portobello Road and the place was falling apart because it hadn't been touched since the 1950s. There was just a lean-to behind the back door and the garden was covered in cracked tarmac but I always felt we should have a room to lead you outside. I'm allergic to the sun these days so I like to sit in here and look out. I thought for a while that it should have a Moroccan feel and I could have little sofas where you could lounge but I think with any room that's new you just have to let it develop. I've always liked the pure classicism of black-and-white floors so I insisted on these tiles and I'm a big fan of tongue-and-groove walls and this is the only place in the house where they're applicable. Then I brought the plants in. I don't like plants very much in other rooms - I like flowers but not plants - but it's quite a nice thing to see if you can conjure up how to grow a gardenia. I'm not succeeding very well but I'm still trying. The jasmine won't grow which is a shame because I love the perfume. The trouble is that there's no skylight so I think that perhaps ferns would be best. I think that if I had my time over again I would have done more with rooms and interiors. Rooms are to do with one's personality and good decorators can apply that personality to a place. The frustrating thing about designing home textiles is that your fabrics go off on a roll and are made up by somebody else and you never see where they land. With fashion you'll see someone tripping down the street wearing something that you've done and you can think that looks nice or dreadful or whatever but you don't have that joy with fabrics for the home. In order to understand interior textiles, you need to put them on a product because the sad truth is that a lot of people don't have an eye or a vision. The Madamoiselle fabric on the chair is the only print in the room because I really needed this space to be print-free. My sitting room is deep red and upstairs is all toile de Jouy fabric and wallpaper so this is the most tranquil room in the house. It was made as a place for relaxation, so I couldn't be surrounded by prints, could I? Especially not my own. \u00b7 Celia Birtwell (020 7221 0877; www.celiabirtwell.com)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
