Arsenal travel to Brighton on Saturday to begin a series of fixtures that, if navigated correctly, could at least haul them towards the Europa League spots. Falling further behind would have unhappy consequences and Arteta knows that, with Southampton and Norwich in store after they have faced Graham Potter\u2019s side, they are entering now-or-never territory. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have any margin for error,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cI think we have to be very, very consistent and get a streak of games winning in a row if we want to lift the belief and reduce the margin of points we have between us and the other top clubs.\u201d Asked how many points he believes Arsenal require, Arteta said he had \u201cno clue with the numbers\u201d. But the 70-point total that brought fifth place last season is mathematically out of reach and they remain four points shy of sixth. They may have to win at least seven of their nine games and their ability to retain players such as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is likely to depend on it. \u201cIt\u2019s a question for the club to respond to,\u201d he said when it was suggested Arsenal would sell Aubameyang if the captain does not agree a contract extension. \u201cI was very clear on Monday about my intentions and, whether we have the financial ability to do the deal and if we are able to convince him it is the right path to continue his career here, it\u2019s another question.\u201d It is one of many, including the issue of David Luiz\u2019s future. The defender, who had a disastrous cameo in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on Wednesday, will leave the club next week if no new deal is agreed. Given that Arteta wants to finalise a permanent move for the on-loan centre-back Pablo Mar\u00ed, despite the Spaniard\u2019s serious-looking injury at the Etihad, there is the sense David Luiz represents an unaffordable luxury. \u201cThis cannot be affected just because a player gets injured doing his job and defending our club,\u201d Arteta said of Mar\u00ed\u2019s status. Arteta also spoke of the need to coax more from the club\u2019s record signing, Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, an unused substitute in Manchester. \u201cIt\u2019s clear his consistency has not been at the level he can produce, he is the first one to accept that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to demand from a player of his level and calibre. He has to be producing every three days at the level he can.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
