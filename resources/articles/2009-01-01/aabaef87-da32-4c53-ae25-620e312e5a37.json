Having celebrated their coup in snatching the rights from the BBC and Sky when they paid \u00a3425m between them for TV rights to the competition and England internationals in March last year, the subsequent economic slump has left both broadcasters facing different pressures. Following an underwhelming third-round draw, ITV in particular will come under scrutiny from analysts and advertisers as it attempts to match the ratings that the BBC achieved during its most recent four-year deal, when it was acknowledged to have helped revive the FA Cup. Following the period at the turn of the decade when Manchester United failed to defend the trophy and some critics argued the competition was drifting into irrelevance due to domestic and Champions League pressures, the BBC threw the weight of its TV channels, radio stations and website behind it. Last year's final between Portsmouth and Cardiff City peaked at more than 8.2 million viewers, while the previous year's encounter between Manchester United and Chelsea peaked at more than 11.5 million. Potential giant-killings regularly won good audiences as well as clashes between Premier League clubs, although the BBC faced scheduling problems and was unable to show big matches in its chosen evening kick-off slots. ITV argues that it can also use the competition to enrich its online and regional offerings, and demonstrate its commitment to football at all levels. Games between non-league clubs in the early rounds were screened exclusively online, while Histon's second-round victory over Leeds was watched by a peak audience of 2.6 million. However, that match will be remembered for other reasons, with ITV reintroduced to the logistical difficulties of screening football from smaller grounds and forced to apologise after a fan swore on air and dressing-room cameras showed a naked Histon player celebrating. The broadcaster will face an even bigger challenge in convincing investors and advertisers that its decision to invest \u00a3275m over four years for its part of the shared deal will pay off. It will also have to do so without the matches being shown in Scotland, after ITV's franchises north of the border opted out of showing them. When ITV and Setanta snatched the rights after skilfully freezing the BBC and Sky out of the negotiating process, it sparked a furious row between the Corporation and the FA. Executives felt their role in reviving the competition had been undervalued and were affronted that they were not offered the opportunity to make a counter bid. Some argue that without the backing of the BBC and sponsor E.ON the Cup would have dwindled in popularity and accuse the FA of lacking a compelling strategic vision for its future. But the outgoing FA chief executive Brian Barwick stood his ground and argued that a 42% increase on the previous deal was too good an offer to turn down and insisted that splitting coverage between ITV and Setanta would not hit the popularity of the competition. ITV has gambled on putting all its sporting investment into top-class football, dropping formula one and the Boat Race and making expensive deals for the FA Cup, England internationals and the Champions League. The competition is also crucial to Setanta, the ambitious Irish pay-TV broadcaster that is attempting to hit its target of 1.5 million premium subscribers by the end of the season. Currently in talks with investors to secure the means to retain its live Premier League rights, currently out to tender, it hopes FA Cup weekends will give it a crucial window to win new subscribers in the absence of top-flight action on Sky."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
