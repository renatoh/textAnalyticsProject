Simon is wrong. Science is crucial for creating the knowledge that leads to all these things and will help us recover from our present economic crisis. Science starts with tentative knowledge and, through the rigorous testing of ideas and the checking of data and observation, proceeds to more reliable knowledge. So Simon is right to point out that science does not always get everything right the first time, giving examples of the volcanic ash cloud, swine flu and BSE. But he fails to observe that we would not even know what these things were without science. It is right that in tough economic times no sector should be safe from scrutiny. When times are tough, we need to invest in our strengths \u2013 and the UK is a real world leader in science. Science is perfectly capable of making the economic case for investment and will continue to do so. Simon recognises the wonder of science; so why does he attack the BBC for what he alleges is the cramming of the airwaves with science? It is not special pleading from scientists that has led broadcasters and publishers to produce more science programmes and books, it is the public's appetite. Like the humanities, science helps us to undertake exciting intellectual journeys to better understand ourselves and the world around us. So the BBC and Martin Rees are right to celebrate science \u2013 it is truly one of the great British success stories.
