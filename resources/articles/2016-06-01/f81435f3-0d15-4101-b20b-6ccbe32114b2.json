A major difference will be found in the stands. For the Italy game, the majority of those packed into the 50,100-capacity Stade Pierre Mauroy in Lille were Irish and how they made themselves heard. Against the host nation at the Stade de Lyon, which holds 58,000, Keane said that the organisers had given Ireland around 4,000 tickets. On behalf of the staff and squad, the assistant manager said that it was not fair. \u201cThere is genuine disappointment \u2013 not just for a silly quote \u2013 that there\u2019s not more Irish fans getting to the game,\u201d Keane said. \u201cThat is a genuine feeling among the whole group. It does seem unfair, for the supporters. Someone said we have three-and-a-half, four-and-a-half thousand; the capacity is 58,000 \u2013 it does seem a bit lopsided. \u201cYou\u2019d expect the home nation to have got an extra few, but that\u2019s a lot more. It\u2019s unfair, particularly the way the Irish fans have travelled and what they\u2019ve brought to the tournament. I was thinking we\u2019d have maybe 15,000 or 20,000 in the stadium, but we can\u2019t change it.\u201d Keane\u2019s other concern was the disparity in preparation time for each team. France, who last played against Switzerland in Lille on Sunday, will have had seven days, compared with Ireland\u2019s four. After the victory over Italy, Ireland returned by bus to their base here and did not make it back until 5am on Thursday. Keane estimated that the routine post-match doping tests delayed them by an hour. The squad had a recovery day on Thursday and they trained on Friday before flying to Lyon at 8pm. \u201cIt\u2019s more unfair about the ticket allocation, but if you asked me: \u2018Do I think seven days\u2019 recovery is better than four?\u2019 Then yeah, you bet your life it is.\u201d This is the first meeting between the nations since the 2010 World Cup play-off, second leg in Paris, when Thierry Henry\u2019s handball helped France to reach the finals. Possibly out of guilt, the hosts have been preoccupied with the story and Keane was asked by a French journalist whether Ireland were considering the possibility of revenge. He shot down the notion. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that mentality,\u201d he said. \u201cRevenge does not come into it.\u201d Keane stressed how it was about Ireland looking forward and at themselves. Against Italy, in what was a must-win game, it was noticeable how they left a few calling cards on their opponents in the early running. The stand-in captain, S\u00e9amus Coleman, was late on Mattia De Sciglio in the first minute and it recalled Keane\u2019s tackle on Marc Overmars at the start of the vital World Cup qualifier against Holland in 2001, which Ireland won 1-0. On both occasions, the challenges set the tone for the team; Ireland fought for the right to play. Keane talked about how important it would be to work tirelessly and win the ball back quickly against France, as they did in the Italy game, and he hoped that the do-or-die nature of it would chime more readily with Ireland\u2019s mentality, in terms of them liking to have a go. Sometimes in group matches, Keane said, they could be caught between sticking and twisting. \u201cAs Jack [Charlton] said years ago: \u2018Put \u2019em under pressure,\u2019\u201d Keane said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a song about that. You do that by getting a foothold, tackling, by getting the ball into the box, by getting midfield runners, by your decision-making, by being physical, having good energy levels. We had that against Italy. Can we get it back for France?\u201d Keane said nice things about Coleman, the right-back, who took over the captaincy from John O\u2019Shea, who was dropped against Italy. When it comes from Keane, it is never lip service. \u201cI can\u2019t speak highly enough of him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a top player. I know he\u2019s at a good club like Everton but he could play for any of the real big teams. He could do that with his eyes shut. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what went on in the huddle but apparently he said some pretty good stuff, which is good to hear. I was getting a bit cynical about huddles, thinking the more times teams do them, the more times they seem to lose. But it worked. Let\u2019s hope it works on Sunday.\u201d In the other full-back position, Stephen Ward is a doubt with an ankle knock. If he does not make it, Robbie Brady, who played well in midfield against Italy and scored the winning goal, could switch to left-back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
