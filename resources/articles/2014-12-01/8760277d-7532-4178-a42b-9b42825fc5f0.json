The proposals, still under discussion on Saturday, a day after the talks were scheduled to end, were too weak to keep global warming to the agreed limit of two degrees above preindustrial levels, setting the world on course to a climate disaster, according to developing countries at the summit. \u201cWe are on a path to three or four degrees with this outcome,\u201d said Tasneem Essop, international climate strategist for WWF. She said the final draft text, a five-page document put forward for approval on Saturday, offered little assurance of cutting emissions fast enough and deeply enough to curb warming. \u201cWe are really unhappy about the weakening of the text. This gives us no level of comfort that we will be able to close the emissions gap to get emissions to peak before 2020,\u201d she said. Saleemul Huq, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development, put it even more succinctly: \u201cIt sucks. It is taking us backwards.\u201d The disappointment with the progress of the Lima negotiations was widespread \u2013 and hugely at odds with the mood of optimism that prevailed at the opening of the talks following a historic deal between the US and China to curb carbon pollution. The deal between the world\u2019s two biggest carbon polluters \u2013 followed just days later by a US pledge to contribute $3bn to a fund to help poor countries deal with climate change \u2013 had created a sense of momentum at the opening of the talks. By Saturday, with exhausted negotiators forced to cancel flights and continue the talks into extra time, those upbeat sentiments were gone. \u201cNone of us is really happy,\u201d a figure in Switzerland\u2019s delegation told the negotiating session. \u201cAt this moment, we have to make sure we are not striving towards the lowest common denominator.\u201d The Malaysian delegate said the proposed deal would not hold the major polluters to account. The Democratic Republic of the Congo representative said: \u201cThis crosses all our red lines.\u201d Sudan flatly said the proposals were unacceptable. The talks at Lima had been charged with producing the blueprint for a climate change agreement due to be finalised in Paris at the end of next year. \u201cLet me be frank. There are parts of this text that make me very uncomfortable and parts that are very thin,\u201d said Tony deBrum, foreign minister of the Marshall Islands. It was initially hoped the agreement would push the world\u2019s large economies into making ambitious commitments to cut carbon pollution while also contributing funds and technology to protect the world\u2019s poorest countries from climate change. But those hopes were frustrated by the divide over whether rising economies should be under similar obligation to cut emissions as America and Europe. India \u2013 though quickly emerging as one of the world\u2019s biggest carbon polluters \u2013 says it should not be held to similar standards as the US and EU. By the time the final draft text appeared, it had been stripped of language that would have required the emissions cuts offered by countries to keep warming below the two-degree target. It was even unclear whether those targets would be subjected to a serious review. In an even bigger blow to small island countries, the draft made no mention of industrialised countries\u2019 responsibility towards the small island states which are under threat of being drowned by rising seas. The accountability gap was a big disappointment for the US and the EU \u2013 which had pushed for a strong review process of such commitments \u2013 as well as the small islands. The proposals also takes the pressure off industrialised countries to make good on promises to provide up to $100bn a year in climate finance to poor countries by 2020. \u201cWe are shocked that some of our colleagues would want to avoid a process to hold their proposed targets up to the light,\u201d DeBrum said. \u201cThere should be nothing to hide.\u201d Mark Maslin, professor of climatology at University College London, said: \u201cThough the weak text emerging from Lima is extremely disappointing, there are still 12 months for the negotiators to up their game before the critical Paris COP [UN climate talks]. Essential to this is for the negotiators to understand that the world\u2019s public expect a global legally binding treaty. Not because it is enforceable, as we know they are not, but it shows commitment to a safe, better and hopefully more equitable world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
