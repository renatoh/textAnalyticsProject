Reluctant as he normally is to reject any suggestion outright, the England manager always made it clear that he had no intention of doing so. In that regard, he was part of a trend across much of the globe. Even Germany marked the new millennium by ditching the 3-5-2 system they had trusted throughout the 80s and 90s. Steve McClaren has therefore been unusual from almost the moment of his appointment in signalling a desire, sooner or later, to try a trio of defenders. That moment could well arrive tomorrow when England face Macedonia in the Euro 2008 qualifier at Old Trafford. To be pedantic, McClaren has dabbled in it very recently. With England leading Andorra 4-0 on September 2, he attempted to shake the torpor out of the game by bringing on Aaron Lennon and Kieran Richardson so that he could have up to five players bursting at the visitors' defence. Just one further goal was added but an insight had been given into his thought processes. McClaren, on that evidence, sees the system as an attacking device. If adopted against Macedonia, Michael Carrick would hang back a little while Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard joined Wayne Rooney to swarm forward in support of Peter Crouch. Judging by parts of England's training sessions, the manager is so keen on the ploy that he has no hesitation about bringing in Shaun Wright-Phillips to flesh it out. The winger has started just two games at Chelsea this season and so slipped Jose Mourinho's mind that he kept claiming injury had left him with no wingers, even when only Joe Cole and Arjen Robben were missing. It is impossible to fault McClaren and his coach Terry Venables, though, for at least yearning to broaden England's repertoire. The manager, who fielded three centre-backs on occasions at Middlesbrough, has the comfort of knowing that it is simple to revert to trusty old 4-4-2 if necessary. England trained in a 3-5-2 formation on Wednesday and some think Steve McClaren might start with it against Macedonia, with Shaun Wright-Phillips and Ashley Cole on the flanks. If that went wrong, though, a quick change to 4-4-2 would be simple enough with the starting XI"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
