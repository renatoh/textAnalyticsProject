The front yard was full of volunteers, some wearing pink and green pins from the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority that Harris joined as an undergraduate at Howard University, a historically black college in Washington. A woman dressed in a sari wished Happy Diwali to Harris, whose mother was an immigrant from India and whose first name means \u201clotus flower\u201d in Sanskrit. As the Democratic presidential hopeful made her way toward the porch to address the crowd, a high school student clasped her hand and thanked her for supporting LGBTQ equality. A little girl bashfully approached her with a picture of an American flag that she had drawn. Harris\u2019s face softened as she knelt down to accept the gift. With a hand clasped to her heart in appreciation, the candidate smiled: \u201cThis is what it\u2019s all about.\u201d But the glow from that afternoon didn\u2019t last long. On Wednesday, Harris was forced to take dramatic action to salvage her beleaguered presidential campaign, slashing staff at her Baltimore headquarters and pivoting to an \u201call-in on Iowa\u201d strategy with less than 100 days before the official start of the Democratic primary contest. It\u2019s a stunning reversal of fortunes for a presidential campaign that began with dazzling promise. Early supporters believed Harris, the 55-year-old junior senator from California, was a candidate whose time had come. Who better to challenge a president accused by his detractors of lawlessness, racism and misogyny than a barrier-breaking prosecutor who would make history as the first black female president? \u201cKamala represents the now and the future of our party,\u201d said Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina Democratic strategist who is unaligned with a campaign. \u201cBut we\u2019re not living in normal times.\u201d In 2016, Democrats watched in horror as Donald Trump vanquished 16 Republicans rivals and their party\u2019s first female nominee, Hillary Clinton. This year, Seawright said, Democrats aren\u2019t trying to make history. They just want the president out of office. Harris\u2019s fate now hinges on her ability to convince voters that she is best suited to the task.And with three months left before Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses, the window for Harris to successfully turn around her campaign is closing. \u201cI\u2019m fucking moving to Iowa,\u201d Harris was recently overheard saying to a Senate colleague, as her poll numbers slipped and her fundraising stagnated. A USA Today/Suffolk poll released on Wednesday showed Harris at 3%, virtually tied with Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who she dismissed two months ago as a lower-tier candidate. Squeezed between the party\u2019s ideological poles in a historically diverse and crowded presidential field, Harris has struggled to turn breakout moments into sustainable momentum. Supporters and critics alike point to early stumbles and missed opportunities that muddled her message and left Harris vulnerable to criticism from moderates and progressives. She has waffled on policy, most notable on healthcare. After embracing Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All healthcare plan, she distanced herself from it then released her own version of it. Elizabeth Warren beat her to the punch calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment and she only recently unveiled a criminal justice reform plan that might have blunted progressive attacks on her prosecutorial record \u2013 as San Francisco attorney general and California attorney general \u2013 had she released it sooner. \u201cHer campaign began with a great deal of promise,\u201d said Lanhee Chen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, who advised Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cBut the campaign has lacked definition and a coherent thesis for why she is running. Is she a moderate? Is she a liberal? Is she a tough-on-crime prosecutor or is she a social justice warrior?\u201d There are also challenges out of her control. Democrats\u2019 deep-seated fear of losing to Trump has perhaps pushed some to perceive people of color and female candidates as less formidable opponents against the president. Harris has started to address concern about her electability \u2013 what she calls the \u201celephant in the room\u201d \u2013 on the campaign trail. \u201cThere is a lack of ability or a difficulty in imagining that someone who we have never seen can do a job that has been done, you know, 45 times by someone who is not that person,\u201d she told Axios in an interview last week. In Virginia on Sunday, Nelfred Tilly Blanding, the host of the canvassing event, said the prospect of Harris\u2019s historic candidacy fills her with pride \u2013 but also apprehension. \u201cShe speaks truth to power,\u201d said Blanding. \u201cI love the way she presents herself.\u201d But Blanding, who intends to vote for Harris, fears the country isn\u2019t ready for a black woman to be president. \u201cIs he going to be happy if we nominate a woman?\u201d she said, referring to Trump. \u201cThat worries me.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Harris entered the 2020 race in spectacular fashion with a rally in Oakland this January, against a backdrop of blue and red \u201cFor the People\u201d signs, a homage to Shirley Chisholm, an African American congresswoman from New York who was the first woman to seek the Democratic party\u2019s nomination. The event drew more than 20,000 people \u2013 the largest of any campaign launch \u2013 and was followed by a rush of donations that helped her emerge as a top fundraiser that cycle. But she faded from view as Sanders and Joe Biden joined and the field bulged with candidates who, like Harris, had been anointed rising stars in a party that is increasingly young, diverse and liberal, including Cory Booker, Juli\u00e1n Castro and Buttigieg. A premeditated attack on Biden over his record on race and federally mandated school bussing during the first presidential debate this summer was the jolt her campaign needed. In the days that followed, her poll numbers soared and donations rolled in. But soon she tumbled from the top tier. Biden rebounded on the strength of his enduring support among black voters. Warren continued to climb, surpassing Sanders and edging past Biden in several early state and national polls. Meanwhile, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, eclipsed Harris as a darling of the donor class. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over time is that Democratic voters are generally pretty happy with their top choices,\u201d said Sean McElwee, co-founder of the progressive analytics firm Data for Progress. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that the Democratic establishment is looking to find a fallback.\u201d He said the unexpectedly weak resistance to Warren\u2019s candidacy by the party establishment has complicated Harris\u2019s quest to emerge as an alternative to Biden. It\u2019s a frustrating position for a candidate like Harris, whose political career had been building toward this moment almost from the start. For years, she was viewed within the party as a presumptive heir to the multiracial coalition that twice lifted the first black president to the White House. As early as 2009, she had drawn comparisons to the 44th president, earning the woefully unimaginative nickname the \u201cfemale Barack Obama\u201d. From the Senate, Harris thrilled Democrats as she lashed into Trump appointees, viral face-offs that offered a preview of what a general election showdown with the president might have in store. In 2018, colleagues and candidates welcomed her support on the trail. And the Democratic National Committee said that fundraising emails sent with her name were particularly successful with party donors. Now as her campaign languishes, Harris has started to draw comparisons to Marco Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida who sought to make history as the nation\u2019s first Latino presidential nominee in 2016. He was tipped as the fresh face of his party, an eloquent speaker with a stirring personal story and a prodigious fundraiser well liked by the party establishment in equal measure. He left the race after Florida Republicans chose a snowbird over its native son. \u2022\u2022\u2022 In a memo on Wednesday to staff and supporters, Harris\u2019s campaign outlined its strategy to avoid a similar fate. \u201cKamala &amp; this team launched with 1 goal in mind: win the nomination &amp; take on Trump,\u201d Harris\u2019s communication director, Lily Adams wrote on twitter. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t to just participate. We\u2019re going to make the hard choices necessary to put us in a place to achieve that goal.\u201d Her campaign is laying off dozens of staff members and pouring its resources into Iowa, where Harris hopes a strong finish will pave the way into more diverse states such as South Carolina, where she has struggled to match Biden\u2019s appeal with black voters and in her home state of California, where she is trailing far behind the field\u2019s frontrunners. In the last month she tallied 15 days and 30 events in Iowa in what the campaign has optimistically dubbed the \u201cOctober hustle\u201d. She will continue to spend much of her time there in November, including the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cPlenty of winning primary campaigns, like John Kerry\u2019s in 2004 and John McCain\u2019s in 2008, have had to make tough choices on their way to the nomination,\u201d Juan Rodriguez, Harris\u2019s campaign manager, wrote in a memo to staff and supporters, \u201cand this is no different.\u201d Another wild card looms on the horizon: impeachment. If the House votes to remove Trump from office, Harris could find herself \u2013 along with Warren, Sanders and other senators still in the race \u2013 stuck in Washington for the president\u2019s impeachment trial during a crucial phase in the primary contest. But it may also present an opportunity for Harris, who has repeatedly pledged to \u201cprosecute the case against Donald Trump\u201d. \u201cDude gotta go,\u201d Harris said, after unloading on the president during the debate last month. \u201cShe is never better than when she is on that committee grilling these rightwing Trump appointees,\u201d said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, a progressive advocacy group that works to elect women of color. \u201cThis could be her moment.\u201d Allison, who has not endorsed a candidate, said there is still a desire to see Harris succeed, especially among black women who are the party\u2019s most loyal constituency. In a recent Essence survey of black women, more respondents chose \u201cother/prefer not to answer\u201d than any 2020 candidate \u2013 evidence, Allison said, that the race is still fluid. Harris has faced daunting odds before, said Andrea Dew Steele, the co-founder of Emerge America, which trains women to run for office, and a longtime friend. In the first race of Harris\u2019s political life for district attorney of San Francisco she ran against a two-term incumbent \u2013 and her one-time boss. It was a bruising contest, Steele recalled, but it revealed her instinct for political combat. When Harris launched her campaign in 2003, she had a Filofax full of potential donors and a polling average of 5%. By the end, she had raised more than $1m and ousted her opponent to become the state\u2019s first African American district attorney. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her win these races when nobody thought she would win,\u201d Steele said. \u201cMy advice: don\u2019t count her out.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
