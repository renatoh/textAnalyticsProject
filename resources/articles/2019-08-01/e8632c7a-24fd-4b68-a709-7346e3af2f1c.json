And above it all a looming AR-15 assault rifle spewing fire. Yet inside Gun Central on Sunday, barely 24 hours after a terrorist gunman killed 22 people and wounded dozens of others in a local Walmart, the expected white Christian nationalists defending the second amendment were not there. Instead there were terrified El Pasoans, mostly Hispanic, buying firearms for the first time. The scene on Sunday at Gun Central, located along Interstate 10 and two miles from where bodies are still being recovered, was more reminiscent of Black Friday than the wake of a national tragedy. People crowded shoulder to shoulder to consult with harried employees, pondering over pistols and assault rifles, banana clips and ammo. Others lined up for their turn inside the store\u2019s indoor shooting range. Staccato gunfire thundered behind the thin walls. \u201cI\u2019m on high alert,\u201d said April Sanchez, a marketing executive who along with her husband was buying her first weapon. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d carry a gun, but now I want something to defend myself, to defend my fellow El Pasoans.\u201d To that end she picked out a 9mm Taurus and her husband a .40 Ruger; their son had purchased his first handgun the previous evening. They sat near a Coke machine with several others awaiting their background checks. Before that day, Sanchez had never even held a gun. Now she\u2019s registering for classes that will allow her to legally carry her firearm in public. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something I\u2019m proud of,\u201d she added. \u201cIt makes me sad and angry that I\u2019m even here. I\u2019m heartbroken, but I\u2019m also afraid.\u201d Gun stores elsewhere in El Paso also reported being busy. At the Cabela\u2019s on Desert Boulevard, an employee who didn\u2019t give his name said sales on Saturday and Sunday were very high, many of them first-time purchases. \u201cWe were also seeing people who\u2019d previously owned guns and gotten rid of them,\u201d he said, adding that it was right after payday, which is usually hectic anyway. On Sunday an employee at Gun Central said they were too busy to comment; calls on Monday weren\u2019t answered. At Gun Central, people waited in line amid displays of red Maga shirts and a sign that said, \u201cJesus Has Risen.\u201d Among them were Denzel Oliver and his girlfriend Christabelle Guzman. On Saturday they had been shopping at the Foot Locker next to Walmart, and as they exited the parking lot, a fleet of police cars raced past. \u201cWe were shopping while people were being killed,\u201d Guzman said. After they got home and turned on the news, her boyfriend suggested they look for a gun for her. Turns out they were thinking the same thing. \u201cI just want to give us both some peace of mind,\u201d said Oliver, 29, who served in the army and owns his own weapons. \u201cI always tell her that El Paso is a bubble. This kind of thing happens elsewhere in the country, but not here. But now, we need to be better prepared.\u201d \u201cKnowing is better than not knowing,\u201d Guzman adds. When asked if buying guns seems a bit extreme, given one random act, Oliver shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s random,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s going to change this community forever.\u201d He points to the crowds as a pop-pop-pop rings out from the range like a soundtrack for a new reality. \u201cJust look,\u201d he says, \u201cit already has.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
