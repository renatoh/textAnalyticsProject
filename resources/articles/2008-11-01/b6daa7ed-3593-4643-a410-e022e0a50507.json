Hearts' players, who receive their salaries every week rather than monthly as is common at football clubs, discovered this afternoon that no wage payments had been received. The same affair occurred in September, with the club blaming a \"glitch\" for the delay on that occasion; the monies were eventually paid a week late. This time, Hearts say there has been a \"blip\" in the payment process. A club spokesperson said: \"The funds are in place, the money has been transferred and will be in the players' bank accounts on Monday morning.\" Routinely but randomly, money is transferred from Hearts' parent company, the Lithuania-based Ukio Bankas Investment Group, into an account with Halifax Bank of Scotland to cover costs. In September, such monies had not arrived and the bank were unwilling to provide an overdraft of more than \u00a3100,000 given that they hold no security. A week ago, the off-field staff at the Edinburgh club were paid their monthly wages but now players' salaries, which total about \u00a390,000 a week, have not been forthcoming."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
