(I like to think she added: 'Especially in the altogether.') Now come reports from Pereira, Colombia, that a group of young women is withholding sex from its gang member boyfriends. They have also recorded a rap about their efforts in order to encourage other women to do the same. Pereira sounds like something out of West Side Story without the singing and dancing (until now, obviously). It has the highest murder rate in Colombia. Allegedly, this violence is linked to the desire to appeal to women. Reports have quoted a survey in which gang members revealed sex to be their 'favourite activity' and said they belonged to a gang to assert their male power and as a form of seduction. In desperation, the mayor announced a gun amnesty. Nothing happened. So the women came on side to urge their men to hand over their weapons or go without sex. The lyrics of their campaign song are not the usual Top 40 fare, but they're trying hard: 'I choose how, where and when I give in/ Women united/ against violent men/ let's close our legs/ sexual strike/ sexual strike.' The two dozen women involved have dubbed their action 'the strike of the crossed legs'. It comes to something when we are looking to Colombia's gangster molls as our feminist icons, but would their 'make war, get no love' formula work elsewhere? Somehow I can't see it, mostly because I cannot imagine anyone who would be willing to record the song to accompany the campaign. And there would be a big problem getting lady singers to cover themselves up for the video. Turn on the radio here and it's less sex strike, more open leg policy. Pussycat Dolls' Nicole says she doesn't give a [beep] if you're looking at her [beep]. Nelly Furtado, who, in more innocent times, declared herself a bird who would rather fly away, is now happy with the label 'promiscuous girl'. Shakira, one Colombian who has not joined the strike, wiggles her hips at Wyclef Jean and claims that her 'will and self-restraint have come to fail now'. This lot would not last two minutes in a sex strike. In Aristophanes's Lysistrata, the Athenian women's action works, stopping the war, because the sisters are all in it together. I worry for the Colombians. Strikes are effective only when there is full union co-operation - and I fear there will be plenty of options on offer for their menfolk. Especially if that Shakira is anything to go by. Instead, I hope someone has told them (their mothers, perhaps?) that in future they might be better off finding different boyfriends in the first place, maybe ones who don't murder people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
