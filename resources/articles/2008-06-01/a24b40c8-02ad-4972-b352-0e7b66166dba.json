This might cause anguished pangs of envy in writers blessed with fewer square metres to play with, but fortunately Manguel explores libraries beyond his own: from the fabled one at Alexandria onwards, each chapter considers libraries historical and fictional in a different thematic light: as order, as space, as power, and so forth. He surveys eccentric schemes of classification, or competing ideas of architectural perfection - a circle within a square, as in the old British Library reading room; or a long rectangular hall, as chosen by Michelangelo for the Laurentian Library, and imagined by Etienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e in a wondrous drawing of a gigantic ideal library, one of many excellent illustrations in the volume. The book's guiding spirit is, inevitably, Jorge Luis Borges, whom we are always pleased to meet. \"To imagine the plot of a novel is a happy task,\" Borges said. \"To actually write it is an exaggeration.\" Of course Manguel's book is also a confession of his love of books, from encyclopedias to Dracula. He confides a lovely hope: \"In any of the pages of any of my books may lie a perfect account of my secret experience of the world.\" Wellsprings Mario Vargas Llosa (Harvard, \u00a311.95) When once summoned, the spirit of Borges likes to hang around a while, smiling at some secret joke. Here he is again, the subject of one of seven lectures-turned-essays. Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa is sceptical, for understandable reasons, of Borges's scepticism regarding the value of writing novels. A novel is not merely \"the expounding of a thesis\", he objects. None the less, he loves Borges, and recounts the charming story of how, as a serious Sartrean student, he attempted to be scornful of everything Borges stood for, yet became spellbound all the same. He also explains, fascinatingly, that Borges represented a revolution in literary Spanish, for \"his precision and concision are absolute\". This is to be contrasted with the \"splendid fireworks display\" of Cervantes, himself the subject of another chapter, wherein the polystylism of Don Quixote is noted for celebration. Other topics include Catalan and Basque nationalism, the Inca (who \"managed to eradicate hunger\"), and appreciations of Karl Popper and Isaiah Berlin. Vargas Llosa's novelist's eye is always on the lookout for tricks. \"The discretion and modesty of Isaiah Berlin,\" he writes in admiration, \"are, in fact, a wily stratagem.\" The Enigmas of History Alan Baker (Mainstream, \u00a39.99) A wily stratagem, too, this apparently half-sober title for what is really a compendium of amazing myths, occult nonsense and a few real mysteries. So we get old chestnuts such as the Holy Grail as Jesus's bloodline, or the amazing astronomical knowledge of the Dogon tribe, which Alan Baker cunningly reports as debunked only after pages of breathless exegesis; but also a few interesting tidbits on what might be the geological reality behind the legend of Atlantis, or the weird 16th-century Voynich manuscript, which looks like a storyboard for The Matrix with annotations in an indecipherable language. There's also an intriguing comparison of fairy and alien lore. Does all this add up to helping us understand \"history\", as the publishers promise? Let us be kind and say that's an enigma in itself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
