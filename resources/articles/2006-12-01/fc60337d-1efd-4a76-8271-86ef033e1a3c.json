Les Reed must be wishing his very own Clarence pays him a visit over the next couple of days, because he's going to need all the friends he can get after this latest shocking performance by Charlton. Dumped out of the Carling Cup by Wycombe and venting goals left, right and centre over the past fortnight in the Premiership, Reed must have thought things could hardly get any worse ahead of this relegation six-pointer. If so, he was much mistaken. Don't let the scoreline fool you. They may have scored only twice, but Middlesbrough were so in control of this match it was almost embarrassing. The fact that Charlton's first shot of any note came in the 85th minute speaks for itself. Charlton's game plan, according to Reed, had been to flood the midfield and counterattack at every opportunity in support of their lone striker, Marcus Bent. Yet something must have been lost in translation. Backed by fewer than 100 travelling supporters, the visitors created so little outside their own half that Middlesbrough goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer may as well have put up a cardboard cut-out of himself and gone Christmas shopping. So where do Charlton, and Reed for that matter, go from here? 'We'll be back at the training ground at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning and we will do our recovery exercise and analyse what went wrong and prepare for the next game,' said the manager. 'We lost the game through basic errors. Things that shouldn't happen did happen and it gave us yet again a mountain to climb.' Middlesbrough's two goals arrived in the 29th and 52nd minutes, with the revitalised Mark Viduka playing a big part in both. It was the Australian's run from midfield and pass to James Morrison, who in turn fed the goalscorer Yakubu Aiyegbeni, that helped put the Teessiders ahead. His downward header from Stewart Downing's corner allowed Julio Arca to drill home a 20-yard shot and make the game safe. Other chances came and were subsequently wasted by Middlesbrough. Against more formidable opponents, such misses could have been costly. Against Charlton, fortunately for Gareth Southgate, it did not matter. 'I think we deserved it on the day, but I thought we could have made it easier for ourselves in the last 15 or 20 minutes,' said Middlesbrough's manager, who had also been under pressure following a run of no wins and just three points from the previous six games. 'It was important that we won. Julio Arca was exceptional today and he capped that with a goal, which is always good for the confidence. There's loads of points to play for and loads of football to go.' Man of the match: Mark Viduka A toss-up between Mark Viduka and Julio Arca. Awarded a standing ovation for his efforts, when substituted in the 75th minute, Viduka gets the vote. Much maligned in the past, the Australian put in a towering performance against albeit poor Charlton."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
