Now a member of the royal family has joined the discussion. But it was neither Prince Harry, famous for being a bit of a hellraiser, nor his notoriously outspoken father Prince Charles who brought the subject up but the normally reserved William who asked former addicts the \u201cmassive question\u201d \u2013 should the ban on drugs be lifted? The Duke of Cambridge spoke about the subject while on a visit to drug addiction charity the Spitalfields Crypt Trust in east London. William asked three people who have been helped by the charity their opinions on whether drugs should be legalised. He did not give his personal opinion but told the trio it was a \u201cquestion I had to ask\u201d. Sitting in the trust\u2019s art room, the duke said: \u201cCan I ask you a very massive question? It\u2019s a big one, there\u2019s obviously a lot of pressure growing in areas about legalising drugs and things like that: what are your individual opinions on that? \u201cI know it\u2019s a big question, but you seem like the key people to actually get a very good idea as to, you know, what are the big dangers there. What are the feelings?\u201d Heather Blackburn said she thought the legalisation of drugs was a good idea and that money was wasted on \u201cdrug laws\u201d. She added: \u201cMost of the people I\u2019ve known in recovery, 95% had massive trauma and terrible stuff happen to them and using drugs to cope and then you get put in prison, you don\u2019t get the facilities and the actual help you need, you get punished ... which is not going to help anyone taking drugs, it\u2019s going to do even more harm, I think.\u201d She added that there should be more help, such as psychiatry, so people could turn their lives around earlier. The duke then asked whether prison tackles the root cause of why someone is taking drugs, to which Blackburn replied: \u201cNo, it just punishes what you\u2019ve done, not the reasons why.\u201d Recovering alcoholic Grace Gunn, 19, who is training to become a midwife, told the future king: \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, you know, \u2018drugs are illegal\u2019 or \u2018now we can all go and do drugs\u2019, because it doesn\u2019t stop the fact we\u2019re a nation of people hurting, and we can\u2019t undo all that overnight. It takes a long period of time.\u201d Jason Malham, a 45-year-old recovering heroin addict originally from Melbourne in Australia, said: \u201cPersonally, I believe that they should not be made legal.\u201d At the end of the discussion the duke thanked the group for giving him a \u201cvery useful little snapshot\u201d, adding: \u201cTalking to you and being here it feels like a question I had to ask, I appreciate your honesty.\u201d As he said his goodbyes William, in a jokey reference to the birth of his third child expected next spring, told Gunn: \u201cAll the best with the midwifery \u2013 might see you sooner than you think.\u201d William\u2019s question to the recovering addicts was welcomed by Danny Kushlick, head of external affairs at Transform, a charitable thinktank that campaigns for the legal regulation of drugs in the UK and internationally. Kushlick said: \u201cThe protocol in the [Westminster] village is \u2018we don\u2019t talk about drugs\u2019. That\u2019s why we appreciate the courage and foresight of Prince William to be stepping into the debate where even seasoned politicians won\u2019t go.\u201d The government\u2019s drug policy is not likely to change in the foreseeable future. In its drug strategy, published in July it said: \u201cWe have no intention of decriminalising drugs. Drugs are illegal because scientific and medical analysis has shown they are harmful to human health. \u201cDrug misuse is also associated with much wider societal harms including family breakdown, poverty, crime and anti-social behaviour. We are aware of decriminalisation approaches being taken overseas, but it is overly simplistic to say that decriminalisation works.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
