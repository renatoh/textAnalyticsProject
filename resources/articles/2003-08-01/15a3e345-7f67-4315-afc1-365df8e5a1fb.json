Atletico Madrid and Athletic Bilbao are also interested in the player, but the fact that Boro are more able to pay a larger slice of Mendieta's \u00a3100,000-a-week wage at Lazio than either Spanish club is probably not insignificant in him choosing the Riverside. Should he sign, Mendieta, 29, would become Steve McClaren's first high-profile summer transfer - so far he has captured only Carlo Nash from Manchester City as a stand-in goalkeeper and clinched the permanent signing of Doriva from Celta Vigo. Tottenham have failed to persuade Santos to part company with their midfielder Diego. The London club reportedly offered \u00a35.66m for the 18-year-old, but Santos apparently raised the asking price. \"We were waiting for an answer but a Santos official confirmed to me that they had closed the negotiations,\" said Djair da Cunha, Diego's father and agent. \"We will wait now for someone willing to pay what he's worth.\" The Senegal international Ferdinand Coly has left Birmingham by mutual consent. He joined the club on a six-month loan deal from Lens during January, but the full-back failed to hold a regular first-team place. Fifa is expected to decide today whether Osasuna have any claim on Birmingham's Argentinian striker Luciano Figueroa. It is reported that the player's lawyer signed an agreement with the Spanish club before he joined Birmingham in a \u00a32.5m transfer from Rosario Central. Both clubs have submitted dossiers for Fifa to review, though Birmingham are confident that their rivals have no legal claim on him. The Bolton manager Sam Allardyce has stepped up his efforts to sign the French winger Ibrahim Ba and has travelled to Italy to speak to representatives of the Milan player. The Reebok club hope to complete the move before the August 31 deadline. Emerson Thome is also expected to leave financially troubled Sunderland and join Bolton on a free transfer. Arsenal, meanwhile, are on the brink of signing Barcelona's teenage midfielder Cesc, 16."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
