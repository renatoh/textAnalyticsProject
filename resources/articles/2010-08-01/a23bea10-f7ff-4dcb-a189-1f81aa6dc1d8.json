GCE A-level passes from grades C to E have some currency and are recognised as qualifications that students may have worked hard to attain. When GCSEs were first awarded in 1988, replacing O-levels and CSEs, a D grade was deemed a standard achieved by an average 16-year-old student, a framework that rapidly became distorted as school league tables were introduced and disregarded passes below C grade. Rather than a situation where \"almost half our young people leave school with no qualifications\", we have an examination system that is failing our young people at 16. Dr James Hall Roehampton University \u2022 Your letters (23 August) and Ben Goldacre's piece on exam standards (21 August) are too focused on statistical evidence. They miss a key factor. Grades based on detailed lists of topic criteria inevitably drive down real standards. The difficulty of a problem depends on various factors \u2013 notably its complexity, unfamiliarity, technical demand and the amount of guidance provided. Most worthwhile problems involve all of these. But in exams it is only fair to enable students to meet the criteria for the highest level they might be able to reach. This is achieved by testing each concept and skill separately, with a short item that makes no other demands. So since 1989 maths exams have been made easier by chopping up problems into smaller parts, now averaging about 90 seconds in GCSE maths. This fragmentation has eliminated the need for teaching the substantial chains of reasoning that doing and using maths actually involves. The QCDA belatedly recognised this in the revised national curricula for key stage 3 and 4 mathematics. But the competition between awarding bodies not to be seen as \"harder\" makes improvement unlikely. Hugh Burkhardt Professor of mathematical education, Nottingham \u2022 It's that time of year again \u2013 the time when the adults of this country feel it their duty to undermine the hard work and success of the young. How many people who bleat the usual line of \"GCSE exams are getting easier\" have any understanding of the hard work and effort put into the exams by the students, teachers and schools? How about turning this on its head and considering that young people are becoming more aware of competition, we are trying harder and our teachers are more focused than at any time in our educational history. So come on \u2013 let's have a pat on the back. Sarah Lamb (age 16) Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
