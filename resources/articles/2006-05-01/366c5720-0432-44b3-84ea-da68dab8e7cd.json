It is a Cabinet Office committee drawn from both houses and appointed by the prime minister in consultation with the leader of the opposition. It reports directly to the prime minister, who places its reports before parliament after deletion of sensitive material. The British government's account of the London bombings does not compete with the size and scale of America's national commission on 9/11. Yet for all the familiarity of the events the two documents describe, they pack the same sickening punch. Each starts with a terse account of an ordinary day in a great city - a cloudless eastern seaboard autumn day in New York, an unsettled and showery summer one in London. Each meticulously tracks the timings as the undetected terrorists make their way towards their unsuspecting victims, normal people starting a normal day's work, some of them about to join the killers on a final journey. But at this point the rush-hour banalities suddenly give way to the sum of all modern fears. In the space of a few minutes, all four bombers killed themselves, taking 52 others with them and causing 700 injuries. An attack of some sort was not unexpected, but the form of it caught the authorities by surprise. The account published by the Home Office yesterday tells the British people something about how all this happened. A separate report from the Commons intelligence and security committee also tries to answer both how and why. Both reports are conscientious and significant. Yet there is no point to the reports if all they do is send a shiver down the spine as we read and remember last year's dreadful deeds. The purpose of such reports is to draw lessons and point to ways of improving the public's safety. In this respect neither report is entirely satisfactory. Each report leaves important questions hanging in the air. Each report tells a story of serious official failure. The failures were particular and general. Two of the 7/7 gang, Khan and Tanweer, were known to the security services. Both had visited Pakistan for extended periods in the months before their suicide mission. Khan, in particular, was already of considerable interest to MI5. It is MI5's job to collate, to sift, to match and to interpret information of this kind. Patently, the service failed to do that in these cases. This seems not to have been purely a matter of inadequate resources. It was also an operational failure, and thus a failure for which management must take responsibility. The new home secretary, John Reid, gave no indication yesterday that this has happened. The ISC report makes some sensible practical criticisms of the intelligence failure. But it provides few effective answers to wider questions. No one should imagine that intelligence can prevent every terrorist act. That is unrealistic. But intelligence should be held accountable for its failures nevertheless. How else can a society learn from mistakes? A significant part of the failure on 7/7 stemmed from a perception that \"home-grown\" suicide bombings were relatively unlikely in Europe (not surprisingly this assessment has now been revised). But this stemmed in turn from an inability to recognise the speed of radicalisation that was taking place in some parts of British Islam, partly because of the British government's support for the Iraq war. The evidence of such radicalisation was so obvious by 2005 that it is hard not to conclude that the security failure was both negligent and inexcusable. How should a strong open society respond to these failures? The twin pillars of the answer are to recognise the scale of the problem and to accept the need for proper accountability. There is much less of a case here for a public inquiry than there is for an independent, no-holds-barred, effective and ongoing review of the governmental and departmental efforts. The obvious way of conducting such a review is to strengthen the role of parliament and the simplest way of doing that is to strengthen the ISC by making it accountable to MPs. When the ISC was first established, it was envisaged it would develop into a fully fledged select committee with real powers. That would not solve all the problems, but it would be a good start."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
