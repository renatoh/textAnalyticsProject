Elsewhere the governing body stood accused of failing to act on multiple warnings about the behaviour of the former technical director Shane Sutton, who resigned on Wednesday following allegations of sexism, bullying and inappropriate behaviour towards the Paralympic racers in the squad. A statement from Yates\u2019s team Orica-GreenEdge confirmed that the Bury racer had tested positive for the anti-asthma drug Terbutaline after stage six of the Paris-Nice \u201cRace to the Sun\u201d on 12 March. The team offered the explanation that the substance was part of an asthma treatment but that the team doctor had failed to apply for a Therapeutic Use Exemption, or TUE, which would have cleared the rider to use the substance for legitimate medical reasons. \u201cThe substance was given to Simon Yates in the form of an asthma inhaler and accordingly this was noted by the team doctor on the doping control form signed at the time of the test,\u201d said a statement from the team. \u201cThe substance was given in an ongoing treatment of Simon Yates\u2019s documented asthma problems. However, in this case the team doctor made an administrative error by failing to apply for the TUE required for the use of this treatment. \u201cThe use of Terbutaline without a current TUE is the reason it has been flagged as an adverse analytical finding. This is solely based on a human error that the doctor in question has taken full responsibility for. There has been no wrongdoing on Simon Yates\u2019s part. The team takes full responsibility for this mistake and wishes to underline their support for Simon during this process. The team is concerned by the leak of this information and has no further comments until there has been a full evaluation of the documentation, statements and evidence that the team and Simon Yates are submitting to the UCI in order to clarify everything.\u201d Terbutaline is a fast-acting bronchial dilator, used for rapid treatment of asthma symptoms and to delay premature labour, which is banned in sport except when taken via an inhaler and with the appropriate TUE to confirm that the athlete in question has medical cause to ingest the substance. The news of Yates\u2019s test came amid a tumultuous week for British cycling, with Sutton quitting on Wednesday as technical director. The Guardian has spoken to several former and current British Cycling staff and the accusations of inaction over Sutton\u2019s behaviour date back at least to 2007. Ian Drake, British Cycling\u2019s current chief executive, had allegedly been informed about Sutton\u2019s conduct during an unfair-dismissal procedure involving the former Paralympic head coach David Mellor, whose case was settled out of court. Documents from Mellor\u2019s evidence shown to the Guardian cited an episode in which Sutton was described as coming to the coach\u2019s office and shouting \u201cget those fucking gimps off the track\u201d. Drake said: \u201cI have never been made aware, formally or informally, of any allegation that Shane Sutton had used the offensive term \u2018gimps\u2019 in reference to Paralympic athletes prior to the media reports of the past few days. The suggestion that I would have not acted on such an allegation is wholly wrong.\u201d Mellor said the episode had taken place after a Paralympic cyclist had wobbled on his bike during a warm-up behind a motorbike shared with able-bodied cyclists. In an email to the Guardian Mellor said: \u201c\u2018Get those Fucking Gimps\u2019 was a phrase that was used by Shane [Sutton] and I confirm was ignored by Ian Drake when raised by me.\u201d Mellor also stated that in his view the Paralympic athletes were discriminated against when it came to resources, for example travelling at times without a doctor or, on one occasion, being asked to scrap a training camp when the able\u2011bodied team\u2019s budget fell short. The governing body did not comment further on the allegations. Drake is under growing pressure to reveal what he knew about the \u201cculture of fear\u201d which is alleged to have prevailed in the National Cycling Centre under Sutton. Two sources told the Press Association that Drake was aware of claims of bullying and discrimination against Sutton and did not act. Several separate sources have described how Sutton was \u201csacked\u201d after the Beijing Olympics but reinstated. British Cycling is also fending off claims that it is covering up a report into the programme\u2019s structure carried out after London 2012, where staff claim concerns over Sutton\u2019s approach were raised. The report was carried out by the former British Cycling chief executive Peter King, who told the Guardian he had conducted interviews with \u201cabout two\u2011thirds\u201d of the team personnel from Dave Brailsford to the stores man and included riders. King said that the report was delivered on 11 November 2012 and \u201cdid not identify any individual either positively or negatively. There was no personalisation of any of the comments in the report.\u201d British Cycling\u2019s current team doctor, Richard Freeman, told the Guardian the report was \u201can opportunity missed\u201d. \u201cWe never got the results in spite of various requests to see it. Nothing changed,\u201d he said. Freeman says he saw the report as \u201can attempt to change the culture because we feared it would get worse if Dave Brailsford left\u201d. However, the Guardian has been told by a former staff member who contributed to the report that he had flagged up serious concerns about bullying of one particular staff member who subsequently left the team \u2013 and misappropriation of British Cycling resources in the report. He states that he categorically warned Drake about appointing Sutton as technical director. A second staff member, still on British Cycling\u2019s books, told the Guardian he had expressed serious reservations about Sutton\u2019s conduct in the report and said the lack of action \u201creinforced the culture of fear and blame\u201d. King said that, had the individuals concerned felt so strongly, their comments \u201cshould have been made as formal complaints\u201d but staffers contacted by the Guardian said this was never offered as an option. A statement from the governing body said: \u201cBritish Cycling conducted a comprehensive structural review after London 2012 to look at how we could build on that success. The report will now be made available to the independent review led by UK Sport. Until the review is concluded we cannot comment any further.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
