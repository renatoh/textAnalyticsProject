He was a recluse who scarcely left the Copenhagen apartment he shared with his wife, and which he painted over and again, with and without her, in beautifully still and silent pictures. And Hammersh\u00f8i seems to have been as secretive as his art. Even in Denmark he remains an enigma. It is not so much that nothing is known of his life. One might say there was little to know. Born to wealthy merchants in 1864, so precocious that even now the piercing portrait of his sister made in his teens stops one dead in the gallery, Hammersh\u00f8i was the star of the country's art academy. At least until he began to show the dark and knotted paintings - of a stalled conversation, of a woman at a bedroom window (shockingly inappropriate) - which seem to have appalled the establishment. At which point Hammersh\u00f8i turned inwards to the privacy of his apartment, except for a few forays to continental Europe and the occasional show. Poet Rainer Maria Rilke, who adored his work and travelled to Copenhagen just to meet him, told of the extraordinary quietude of Hammersh\u00f8i's life and his almost inaudibly soft voice. How bitter that the illness which killed him, at 51, should have been throat cancer. It is the work, not the man, that appears enigmatic: content to wander through the same few whitewashed rooms, day after day, year after year, as the sun comes and goes through the windows - the solitary visitor. Nothing moves. All is silent. The rooms, with their perfectly cleared tables and bare floors, are pointedly empty. The door is shut or it opens on to a corridor with another closed door beyond. Even the windows look on to other windows or walls of opaque light. There is no opening out into the world. And remarkable as it seems in a show of more than 70 pictures, Hammersh\u00f8i is always discovering something new. Like Morandi with his little group of vessels or Chardin with his apricots and cherries, he keeps testing the truth of what he sees. Perhaps the light is more powdery, the floor more opaque; perhaps the easel looks more like a figure than the stove in the corner. The character of each object is investigated as if it were a person - a piano, the table, the white ceramic bowl round which the daylight gradually sidles. Even when Ida Hammersh\u00f8i is present, her face is averted or she stands with her back to the viewer, a column of black, head to toe, interrupted only by the whiteness of her nape. But nothing is explained by her presence; everything remains opaque. At the piano, she plays no music; at the table, her cup stands untouched. Hammersh\u00f8i is by no means the only rear-view painter; think of Vermeer or Caspar David Friedrich, both of whom he is known to have studied. But he varies the convention. A rear view silences a picture - communication is closed - and it makes a figure mysterious; we don't know what he or she is thinking, feeling, we don't know who they are. But we always know that this is Ida and nothing could make these paintings quieter. Instead, one feels that she is under the picture's spell, too, lost in contemplation of this little world. No matter where she stands - hemmed in between door and stove, dead centre looking out of the window - she is never the protagonist. That role goes to the daylight itself, arriving in the room like an unexpected visitor, settling on the sofa, igniting fine particles of dust. In Sunbeams, the light seems to hover outside the picture itself, a remarkable illusion but, more than that, a hymn to this everyday marvel. There are shocks. Suddenly Hammersh\u00f8i is outdoors, though the rest of the world is just as silent: no pedestrians in the streets, no farmers in the fields; suddenly he is in London, where the light sinks muggy and brown. He did paint other subjects and they can be rapt and beautiful - dawn radiating through dark trees, low white farmhouses against whiter northern skies - but never as much as the apartment. The surprises here are of a different class. A fold in a linen tablecloth stands sharp as a cliff, shadowed valleys either side. One day there is a dish of butter and a hint of real time enters the scene, though it's soon gone. Ida turns round, but her eyes are downcast, obscured, and she turns blank in the hazy room. Hammersh\u00f8i runs a narrow palette between silver, pearl grey and black with a matt taupe reminiscent of Manet. He has a brief sharp-edged phase but mainly his pictures accrue as slowly as fine powdered snow. This increases their soft strangeness, but so do Hammersh\u00f8i's almost imperceptible manipulations of the scene: picture frames that contain no pictures, shadows neatly tidied away, a piano with only two legs; all done to distil and clarify, and so subtly that one does not even notice. Never believe that Hammersh\u00f8i only painted what he saw. Even the apartment itself, picture by picture, doesn't match the reality, as visitors to Strandgade 30 have discovered. His art reorders his world. One may think that the meaning of these paintings is not altogether complex or inaccessible - in praise of peace, order, silence, simplicity - but there is nothing simple about them. The tone itself shifts between serenity and a clouded pensiveness bordering on loss, but still Hammersh\u00f8i sits patiently at his easel, working away at these pictures with their strange, slow, clarity. He said it was only here he felt happy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
