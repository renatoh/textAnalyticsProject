Dominic Lawson, the editor of the Sunday Telegraph, warned the corporation would have to compensate the paper if Simpson was forced to breach his contract. Lawson described Simpson's deal with the Sunday Telegraph as \"pretty long term\" and said the paper would demand compensation if it were compelled to give him up as a contributor. The BBC said that far from offering compensation, it was planning to charge the Sunday Telegraph for publishing any articles by Simpson after the spring. This is when new rules barring BBC staff from writing for newspapers will come into force. \"We're not talking to the Sunday Telegraph about compensation,\" said a BBC spokesman. \"Clearly there's an appetite from the public for this kind of journalism but we believe it should be on the BBC first and we can syndicate it; we are talking to the Sunday Telegraph about that at the moment.\" The BBC has said articles that appear first on the BBC news website will be allowed to be syndicated as long as they are approved by a senior management and submitted to the relevant publication via the BBC press office. However, this is unlikely to be a viable option in the competitive world of newspaper journalism, where columnists are paid large sums for writing exclusively for publications. Politicians were today divided on the BBC's decision to ban presenters and journalists from writing about current affairs and \"contentious\" issues. They will be allowed to write on subjects such as food, music and film as long as their copy is approved by senior management. The Liberal Democrat culture and media spokesman, Don Foster, criticised the corporation for attempting to deflect criticism from Lord Hutton's forthcoming report on the BBC prematurely. \"This decision is overly cautious. Westminster villagers have been holding their breath for Hutton's conclusions for some time now and the BBC should have done the same,\" Mr Foster said. \"They've already expressed their deep regret and willingness to change and BBC journalists writing about truly contentious issues could create a conflict of interests. \"But a ban on writing about anything but cookery and DIY is far too strict. Do we really need any more celebrity cooks and handymen?\" Gerald Kaufman, the veteran Labour backbencher and chair of the Commons select committee on culture, media and sport, said BBC journalists and presenters should never have been permitted to express political views in newspaper columns in the first place. \"It's one thing for them to have areas of opinion in the BBC where they have people signed on to do specific programmes who are not associated to the BBC. \"But if the BBC signs on people who are regarded by those who listen to them or see them on television as impartial presenters or journalists who are presented as impartial, I don't believe it's right for those people to go off and write articles or columns for newspapers in which they express political opinions,\" said Mr Kaufman. Simpson's contract with the Sunday Telegraph extends way beyond the spring cut-off date by which BBC journalists are expected to stop writing for newspapers and magazines. He is just one of a handful of high-profile BBC presenters and journalists who are likely to be affected by the ban. Today presenter John Humphrys is reputed to receive \u00a3140,000 to write a weekly column for the Sunday Times; BBC business editor Jeff Randall also writes for the Sunday Telegraph and political editor Andrew Marr writes for the Daily Telegraph. Lawson today lambasted the BBC's decision as \"political and irrelevant\". He said he hoped a compromise could be reached by which the corporation felt it was in control but its staff were allowed to \"vent their journalistic expertise\". Rod Liddle, the former Today editor who was forced out of his job in a row over a column he wrote for the Guardian, branded the move \"intellectually muddled\" and said Fleet Street would lose some of its finest writers. The BBC has insisted it is not offering financial compensation to journalists who stand to lose tens - if not hundreds - of thousands of pounds as a result of the ban. However, senior insiders indicated the BBC contracts of high-profile staff are likely to be renegotiated on improved terms to soften the blow. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
