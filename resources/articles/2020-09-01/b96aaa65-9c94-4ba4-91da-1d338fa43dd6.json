Police were called to the home in Desota Drive in the Seven Isles community of Fort Lauderdale late on Sunday afternoon. The home is owned by Bradley and Candice Parscale. \u201cWhen officers arrived on scene, they made contact with the reportee (wife of armed subject) who advised her husband was armed, had access to multiple firearms inside the residence and was threatening to harm himself,\u201d Fort Lauderdale police said in a statement. \u201cOfficers determined the only occupant inside the home was the adult male. Officers made contact with the male, developed a rapport, and safely negotiated for him to exit the home.\u201d Police identified the man as Parscale. He did not threaten police and accompanied officers willingly under Florida\u2019s Baker Act, which gives police the power to detain a person who poses a potential threat to themselves or others for 72 hours for psychiatric evaluation. On Monday afternoon, police body-cam footage was released of Parscale being dramatically taken down and handcuffed by police. Parscale was taken to Broward Health medical center. The number and nature of the firearms in the Parscale home was not known. Fort Lauderdale\u2019s mayor, Dean Trantalis, said he had been informed there was a Swat team standoff at Parscale\u2019s home. \u201cIt was indicated to me that he had weapons,\u201d Trantalis told the Sun-Sentinel. \u201cI\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t do any harm to himself or others. I commend our Swat team for being able to negotiate a peaceful ending to this.\u201d Parscale was removed as Trump\u2019s campaign manager in July after a much-hyped campaign rally in Tulsa attracted an embarrassingly sparse crowd. He was replaced by the then deputy campaign manager, Bill Stepien, but has stayed on as a senior adviser to the campaign. On his Twitter account Parscale describes himself as \u201csenior adviser, digital and data\u201d for Donald Trump. The Trump campaign communications director, Tim Murtaugh, issued a statement late on Sunday offering support to Parscale. \u201cBrad Parscale is a member of our family and we all love him. We are ready to support him and his family in any way possible.\u201d A police report on Monday noted that officers were called by a woman reporting that Parscale had been heard \u201cranting and raving about something\u201d before a gunshot was fired. Candice Parscale told police that she ran from the house because she was alarmed by her husband\u2019s behavior, local TV station WPLG reported. According to the report, Parscale began to barricade himself inside the home, hanging up on callers, the police report said, adding that he later spoke to police negotiators. \u201cI initiated a double leg take down,\u201d wrote Sgt Matthew Moceri, a responding officer, noting that the 6ft 8in Parscale towered over him and would not get on the ground. When officers initially arrived, Candice Parscale said the couple had argued and Brad pulled out a handgun and loaded it. She said he had post-traumatic stress disorder and had recently become violent, showing police bruises on her arms from an argument two days prior. Police photographed the injuries, they said, and the Miami Herald reported.
