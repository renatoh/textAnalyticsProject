Take a short walk down Durnsford Road from Bounds Green tube station and turn right into Albert Park. Five years ago you would have thought twice before taking that turn. In the words of one local mother, the park used to be \"run-down and gang-ridden, definitely not a place where people wanted to hang about\". In the far corner was a sorry set of gravel-strewn tennis courts. In 2005 there were 250 reported incidents of crime here. In 2009 there was one. Last Tuesday the park was overflowing with teenagers playing football, parents pushing prams and hoards of clamouring schoolkids having tennis lessons on pristine new courts. Three months ago the Parliamentary All-Party Tennis Group published a damning report on the work of the Lawn Tennis Association. For the LTA's chief executive, Roger Draper, kind words were hard to come by, and the few that could be found were couched as the most backhanded of compliments. \"Esteem for the LTA seems to be at an all\u2011time low,\" read one line, \"and as a result much of the good work of the LTA is overlooked.\" A trip to Albert Park will soon convince you of the truth of that, though it has to be pointed out that much of the credit for what has happened here belongs to the Tennis Foundation, the LTA's charitable wing. All the same, it is easy to see why Draper has chosen Albert Park as the venue for this interview. The LTA has invested \u00a3300,000 to fund its refurbishment and the results are impressive. Draper is right when he says that the Albert Park club is \"at the heart of the community\". Albert Park is one of 46 \"beacon sites\" in the UK, offering access to new facilities and quality coaching to the public. The beacon sites are a key part of the LTA's strategy to develop tennis, and by 2013 there will be 225 of them. Three years ago Draper commissioned Sue Mappin, who is now the executive director of the Tennis Foundation, to review the LTA's grass-roots strategy. \"We are putting a lot of investment, both from ourselves and the money we get from Sport England, into facilities like this,\" Draper says, \"resurfacing the courts, putting in floodlights. This is one of many schemes that are going up around the country and it is all part of our drive to grow the sport and get more people involved in tennis.\" Before we met, a colleague told me Draper was \"the kind of man who has all the answers\". He needs to be. After Britain's Davis Cup defeat by Lithuania, Draper came under intense scrutiny. \"It is crucial that grass-roots tennis ought to be at the top of the LTA's priorities,\" said the all-party report, adding that \"the public perception of tennis as a middle-class sport has to be changed\". \"I don't have all the answers, I wish I did,\" Draper says. \"But I think my time as chief executive of Sport England gave me a really good, deep understanding of some of the issues sport faces in this country. Particularly as during that time the one thing I felt was missing was investment in the community area and I think that is beginning to happen now. One of the biggest jobs I have got is making sure, particularly in the schools and the parks, that we reach out and change some of the old myths and perceptions: that tennis is expensive, that tennis is white and middle class. It isn't, as schemes like this show. And this isn't just happening in Haringey, it is happening all around the country.\" So here we are in Haringey, a borough in which only 43% of the population are white and British by birth, and where several wards are ranked among the most deprived 10% in the country. And where the LTA already has two beacon sites. \"I come from Wigan and started playing tennis in a park myself so I'm not from a traditional tennis background,\" says Draper. \"We are trying to dispel some of those myths and change some of those perceptions that have been hanging around a long time. You will always find a snooty tennis club just as you will always find a snooty golf club or a snooty football club, but they are becoming exceptions to the rule.\" Draper has been in office for four years. For much of that time he has been criticised for focusing LTA investments on the elite level, including hiring big-name coaches like Brad Gilbert and Paul Annacone to work with the nation's top players. \"You wouldn't be human if you didn't make mistakes,\" Draper says. \"What you learn from some of those mistakes is the important thing. Because we put a lot of emphasis on sorting out elite performance, a lot of people sort of thought, 'Well that's all they are interested in. They are not interested in what's going on on the ground.' But we couldn't fix everything at the same time. \"If there is a mistake we made early on, it was in failing to communicate the fact that actually it is about growing the sport. And also the timescale that this would take. People want instant results, but transforming any sport isn't going to happen overnight.\" Gilbert and Annacone, Draper believes, will leave \"a strong legacy\" because of the help they gave to the country's young coaches. As with the beacon sites, that positive influence will take time to show through. Whether his words are vindicated or not, there is no doubt that the health of British tennis depends as much on what Draper and the LTA can deliver in the next 10 years in places with postcodes like N11 as it does on what happens during the next two weeks in SW19."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
