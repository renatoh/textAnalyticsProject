The Portuguese worked with Eto'o at Internazionale and would cost around \u00a35m from Anzhi Makhachkala. The move indicates that the club have all but conceded defeat in their pursuit of Wayne Rooney, though having had bids of \u00a323m and \u00a325m rejected by Manchester United, Mourinho may decide to test the champions' resolve one last time. Eto'o, who is available as Anzhi seek to cut costs, seems to be open to the move, saying: \"There is only one Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. I have played under a lot of great coaches \u2013 but there is no other character in the game like Jos\u00e9\". Jamie Jackson Willian to Liverpool Liverpool are poised to make a \u00a330m bid for the Brazilian midfielder Willian as the club's pursuit of a high-profile summer signing goes on. Willian moved to Anzhi Makhachkala from Shakhtar Donetsk during the last transfer window, also for \u00a330m, but having played only 17 times for Anzhi in all competitions the predominantly left-sided attacker has been put up for sale, along with the rest of his team-mates at the cash-strapped club. Sachin Nakrani Eriksen to Tottenham The Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen admits he would be keen on a move to Tottenham Hotspur. The 21-year-old has rejected interest from Russia and would jump at the chance to be reunited with his former Ajax team-mate Jan Vertonghen at Spurs should they make an approach. \"Tottenham are a great club,\" the Ajax midfielder told the Danish newspaper BT.
