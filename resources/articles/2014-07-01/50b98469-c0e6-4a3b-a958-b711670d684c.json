First up, in the flyweight division, was Michaela Walsh, a 21-year-old from Northern Ireland. \u201cIt was brilliant, I was just so excited, like a kid on Christmas morning.\u201d She beat Thessa Dumas, from Mauritius, posed for a few photos with Dame Mary Peters and then started tossing a few threats in the direction of Nicola Adams. \u201cI\u2019d love to meet her. She may be the golden girl now but now there is a new golden girl coming.\u201d Adams, whose gold medal at London 2012 was one of the highlights of those Games, was top of the bill and last on for the evening, well after 11pm. Plenty stayed late to see her fight Nigeria\u2019s Oluwatoyin Oladeji. In June Adams lost for the first time since she won that gold, defeated on points by a Bulgarian boxer in the quarter-finals of the European Championships in Bucharest. She was suffering from a shoulder injury at the time, which she has since recovered from. Mindful that, as Walsh showed, \u201ceverybody will be coming for me now I\u2019m Olympic champion\u201d, Adams promised before the Games to \u201cbox like every fight is the final\u201d. She did not need to go that hard against Oladeji, a decent fighter who was ranked 33 at the 2012 world championships and won a bronze in the 2014 African Championships. Instead Adams kept a lot back but did just enough to earn unanimous decisions in all four rounds and win 3-0 on points. Adams really opened up only in the final round, when she threw a few brisk combinations that left Oladeji reeling and the crowd roaring. \u201cShe was really tough, really determined,\u201d Adams said. She did not seem too troubled. \u201cIt feels amazing being here. I\u2019ve had a fantastic reception in Glasgow. These Games rank really highly, as high as the Olympics for me.\u201d As for Walsh, Adams added: \u201cI\u2019m not worried about meeting her at all. I concentrate on my grass and I don\u2019t worry about how green everyone else\u2019s grass is looking.\u201d She is enjoying being the favourite. \u201cThe fact that everybody thinks I can win, that I will win gold here, gives me the confidence to keep going on believing I can win it.\u201d The only disappointing thing was that she had not been allowed to wear a bandana, in the green-and-blue tartan of the Adams clan, which she had been sent by a 16-year-old fan. Adams is part of a three-strong women\u2019s team in Glasgow, along with two other fighters from the Great Britain squad at the London Olympics \u2013 Savannah Marshall at middleweight and Natasha Jonas at lightweight. She got a better reception than a couple of the other English boxers on the bill. Anthony Fowler, the cousin of the former Liverpool footballer Robbie Fowler, got a chance to play the pantomime villain in his middleweight bout against Scotland\u2019s Kieran Smith \u2013 and he relished every minute of it. He flashed a few grins to acknowledge the jeers and held his arms aloft in celebration after each round, although he only edged them. \u201cAll those boos really fired me up,\u201d he said. \u201cI love performing. That was one of the best nights of my life so far.\u201d Smith, 21, was so high on the adrenaline of the occasion that he rushed in from the first bell. \u201cObviously his coach has got him fired up and said \u2018look, you\u2019re at home, so let\u2019s get stuck into him\u2019,\u201d said Fowler. \u201cBut that\u2019s played into my hands.\u201d He picked him off with strong scoring shots. Smith started to hesitate. \u201cAs soon as he was thinking twice about coming in it got a little bit easier,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI said to him in the clinches, \u2018That\u2019s easy that, son.\u2019 But really he was very impressive. He took some big shots and he gave the crowd their money\u2019s worth.\u201d England\u2019s Qais Ashafq also won in the bantam category. He will now fight Scotland\u2019s Joe Ham on Wednesday. \u201cI have fought the English guy twice, I have beaten him and he has beaten me,\u201d said Ham. \u201cWe know each other but he is not beating me in front of this crowd.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
