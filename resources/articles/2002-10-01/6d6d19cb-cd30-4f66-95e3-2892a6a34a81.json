He was asked \"to present the essential arguments for higher funding for the BBC in one last letter to the prime minister\". He was then phoned by a Downing Street official: if the PM agreed a substantial rise, would the BBC squander it on sports rights or overinvesting in BBC1? \"I gave my assurance. I said [Greg] Dyke might be new, his ideas not yet settled, but [chairman] Christopher Bland wholly supported the BBC's publicly proclaimed strategic vision and was as deeply prejudiced as I was about the BBC paying ridiculous sums for sports rights.\" And on February 21, the government announced a generous new licence-fee deal. Which is why Dyke's commercial, competitive instincts - as shown by the fourth episode of EastEnders and Panorama's exile - provoke anger; and why Birt's refusal, when interviewed about his autobiography, to talk about \"current issues\", are so frustrating. In the end he answers me, but obliquely: \"There have always been tensions in the BBC between those who strive for ratings and popular programming and those who want to drive it in a public service direction. It is inevitable. It is perfectly understandable, those who run channels press to increase ratings. \"I saw myself the whole time applying pressure to drive the BBC in a different direction, to encourage innovation, break new ground in every area of programming. Trying to tip the balance. You have to talk in terms of balance. I always tried to place the pressure there.\" It's a very different approach from Dyke, the former LWT colleague he admits to coaching for his final BBC interview. Now a strategy adviser to Tony Blair, is Birt missing television? \"I have no inclination to return to that form of life.\" Pause. \"No one should ever say, 'Never'. But there's been no surprise yearning. I felt when I left the BBC, that was it. I had reached the pinnacle of my career. Thirteen years at the top of a large organisation going through punishing change is a form of penal servitude, and you are very happy to be out of it.\" Also different is the way Dyke is tackling the BBC, encouraging laughter rather than fear as he implements changes. Does Birt have any regrets over the way he drove BBC reform? \"Everybody has the defects of their virtues. I was very strategic, very effective in identifying the huge challenges the BBC faced. I was pretty ruthless in making sure the organisation reached those objectives. Did I occasionally go 2% too far? Yes. Two per cent too far, that's all.\" One of his few regrets is allowing Radio 4's programming and schedule to be too abruptly shaken up by James Boyle. But he prefers to focus on his overall record: \"I joined the BBC that was on the rocks in 1987, deeply divided, creatively patchy, journalistically weak, unaccountable, unmanaged, no sense of the outside world, no basic information about its own services. When I left in 2000 it was as creatively strong as ever in its history, had the most powerful force in journalism anywhere in the world, had a better understanding of the digital challenge than any other in the world, well-managed, lean, agile, alert. That transformation was remarkable. But it was painful.\" Marmaduke Hussey, Bland's predecessor as BBC chairman, fell out with Birt in 1994 and is highly critical in his autobiography of his poor judgment and management skills. Birt says this bitterness sprang from the director-general getting the credit for winning the BBC a new charter: \"His pride was wounded. I don't think he does himself justice. By writing about our relationship, he has failed to get over that he was one of the most important chairmen in the BBC history, arguably the first chairman not to be seen off by the BBC.\" Birt spent two decades in ITV before joining the BBC. How does he see recent changes in the network? Clearly referring to the likes of Charles Allen and Michael Green, he says \"a lot of people came into ITV who were leadership-, not programme-oriented. They didn't husband the tradition. The disappointment was that that leadership turned out to be very unstrategic. You might have hoped for that at least. One symbolic side effect is ITV only limping on to Sky in the last couple of months and another is ITV Digital. Can the Carlton/Granada merger fix anything? He clams up. Birt lost out to Jeremy Isaacs when he applied to be Channel 4's first chief executive, and now says he's disappointed by \"how few programmes over the whole life of Channel 4 are really going to go down in the chronicle of British broadcasting. It deserves very, very high marks for vitality, less high marks for creative achievement.\" To the outsider the most amazing element in the book is Birt's chronicling of the huge amount of schmoozing and networking he engaged in. Should the BBC director-general be so chummy with politicians? The then culture secretary Chris Smith stayed at his weekend home just before the last licence-fee settlement. He publishes a picture of himself with Tony Blair on holiday. \"The BBC has two kinds of dealings [with politicians]. One is its enormous coverage of political affairs. The other is about BBC policy. It's unavoidable, government is regulating all the time. So I am unapologetic about building over 10 years very effective relations with all political parties and senior civil servants. You don't win a case by sucking up to politicians, you win a case by making it well. It's a tribute to Britain's politicians that you were able to have a dialogue with them while also giving them an enormously hard time. It's a maturing of our democracy. The BBC won its independence in the 1980s, after Norman Tebbit's attack on its political impartiality. Since then there's not been a serious assault.\" \u00b7 John Birt's The Harder Path is published on Thursday by Little, Brown, price \u00a320"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
