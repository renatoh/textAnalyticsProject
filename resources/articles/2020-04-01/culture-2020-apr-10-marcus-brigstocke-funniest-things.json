But it\u2019s got to be Robin Williams Live at the Met. When I was a teenager I knew every word of it and quoted it constantly. The funniest TV show I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 The Day Today. \u201cWhere now for man raised by puffins?\u201d \u201c\u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u2019 yells exploding cleaner.\u201d And \u201cheadmaster suspended for using big-faced child as satellite dish\u201d. This is the TV show that introduced me to Alan Partridge \u2013 though he was on On the Hour first, of course, on the radio. The funniest film I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 Blazing Saddles. It has more jokes in it than any other film and makes me howl every time I watch it. The funniest person I know \u2026 Rob Rouse \u2013 he makes me giggle like a fool. He was in Upstart Crow in the West End when the virus came for us all. Now he\u2019s racing chickens in the Peak District on Twitter and Instagram. The funniest heckle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 I asked someone to say which was best \u2013 Byron or Five Guys (the burger shops) and she genuinely believed I was asking her to choose between the poet Byron and the musical Five Guys Named Moe. The funniest meal I\u2019ve ever eaten \u2026 Cheese fondue (homemade) at Glastonbury with Phill Jupitus. We dunked mini pork pies in when we ran out of bread. The funniest hairstyle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 I was a Robert Smith wannabe goth, so fluffy, spiky hedgehog style. The funniest dream I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 That the Edinburgh fringe might still somehow happen in 2020. Madness! The funniest joke I\u2019ve ever heard \u2026 Did you hear about the inflatable boy at the inflatable school who was sent to see the inflatable headmistress for bringing in a pin? She said: \u201cYou\u2019ve let me down, you\u2019ve let yourself down, but worst of all you\u2019ve let the school down.\u201d Marcus Brigstocke\u2019s new series, Jazz Family Trees, is on Jazz FM, Saturday 11 April, 9pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
