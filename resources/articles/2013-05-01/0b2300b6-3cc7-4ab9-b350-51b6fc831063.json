This album is effectively its female counterpart. The main work is the 1663 Mass Macula Non Est in Te for women's voices by Louis Le Prince, choirmaster at Lisieux Cathedral. The title \u2013 \"There is no stain in thee\" \u2013 refers to the immaculate conception, and its movements are interwoven with motets devoted to the Virgin Mary by Charpentier and Lully. Le Prince's polyphony is closely wrought and rather severe. Charpentier and Lully are less formal and more overtly sensuous. The performances are, as one might expect, ravishing, but both sentiments and soundworld are more conventional here than in its masculine equivalent: the latter, recorded in 2010, is also available on Glossa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
