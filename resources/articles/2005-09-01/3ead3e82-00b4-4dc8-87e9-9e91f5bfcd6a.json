Murdoch Sr billed Carlucci, who is head of News Corp's advertising and marketing company, News American Marketing, as a man \"without peer in the consumer advertising and marketing industry\". The 58-year-old will retain his position at News America Marketing, but spend most of his time at the Post. He began his career in advertising sales at the Post's main competitor, the New York Daily News. Damon Albarn, the lead singer of Blur, is to emerge from his cartoon alter ego at Manchester Opera House for the first unrestricted viewing of a live performance by Gorillaz, the animated band he created. The group has performed live before, but the musicians were hidden by a screen featuring the four cartoon characters. For the first five nights in November Gorillaz will perform their album Demon Days and tracks from their first album, and be accompanied by guests including Shaun Ryder, the Happy Mondays frontman. Chris Deering, president of Sony Europe, is to step down next month after 18 months in the role. He will join his wife and two children in his native America, where he will act as an adviser to the company. Deering's successor will be Fujio Nishida. Deering, 61, became president of Sony Europe in April 2004 after founding Sony Computer Entertainment in 1995, where he launched the PlayStation games console. Recently he has been reducing costs across the company and this year created a storm by announcing that Sony had lost its way, an admission previously considered inconceivable. He argued, however, that since missing trends such as digital music players the company had recovered. Patrick Eston has been elected the new leader of Veritas, the Eurosceptic political party founded by Robert Kilroy-Silk. The contest was triggered when Kilroy-Silk quit the party in July after facing a challenge from disillusioned members. Kilroy-Silk's deputy, Damian Hockney, also resigned and the outgoing leader handed over temporary charge of the party to Eston. In the poll Eston beat Colin Brown, the party's foreign affairs spokesman, and Winston McKenzie, the former boxer, on a turnout of 22.3%. Roast, the restaurant dreamt up by Cinnamon Club founder Iqbal Wahhab, is finally to open in London's Borough market next month. The launch was delayed by contractual and planning problems.
