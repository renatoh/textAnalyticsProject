Leading the charge has been Kayhan, the most influential newspaper on the authoritarian right and edited by Hossein Shariatmadari, an appointee of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. A few days after the mid-term congressional elections in the United States, Kayhan ran an article dismissing as \u201cpointless\u201d the change of venue for the nuclear negotiations to Oman, where back-channel talks in 2013 between the US and Iran helped pave the way for the interim Geneva agreement. Kayhan called US policy \u201cwar-seeking\u201d and described Obama as a \u201cscarecrow\u201d who was in no position to make an agreement. The article concluded that \u201ca deal with the US has been an illusion from the very beginning.\u201d A reformist journalist in Tehran gave Tehran Bureau an interpretation: \u201cThe defeat of the Democrats in the US mid-term elections gave Shariatmadari\u2019s team a chance to label Obama as an ineffectual \u2018scarecrow\u2019, something which is in line with their more general strategy of convincing Khamenei that even if Iran should reach a strong agreement with Obama\u2019s government, the inevitable power shift after the next US presidential elections will make all these efforts fruitless. This is the current tactic to disrupt and delegitimise the negotiations in Muscat [in Oman].\u201d On October 29 Vatan, a newspaper owned by Mehrdad Bazrpash, a confidant of former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, attacked the media for paying too little attention to the nuclear talks. Vatan contributor Amir Ali Jahandar predicted that a \u201charmful agreement\u201d was looming, with the public distracted by presumably more frivolous topics like the recent acid attacks on women in Iran. \u201cBeyond our borders there is a wealth of news regarding the negotiations, an issue which unfortunately remains far from the minds of the people at present. This news speaks of the current round of negotiations which...could result in an agreement that would be detrimental in every sense of the word and further endanger Iran\u2019s national rights. In all of this, it is crucial that revolutionary media correctly interpret the news they receive and refrain from publishing items simply for their exciting content.\u201d More recently, Vatan published an article snidely suggesting the negotiations were simply a means for foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his lackeys to preserve positions within Iran\u2019s political system: \u201cThose brave and sombre actors currently shouldering the task of the nuclear negotiations, in order to remain active on the domestic scene and further obscure their affinity for the west with smoke and mirrors, will submit to an agreement at any cost, so long as it does not affect their domestic brand.\u201d But this article, contrary to the earlier one, goes on to suggest there is no chance of an agreement. \u201cThe red line that has been drawn by the supreme leader can only be changed by the leader himself. The leader has also consistently shown that in implementing the country\u2019s broader policies - something which is his legal and divine right - he considers the interests of the country above all personal and material considerations. There is indeed no cause for worry that this red line will be crossed, for there are forces at home with whom these rational actors wouldn\u2019t want to find themselves at odds.\u201d This was apparently a rebuttal to Alireza Zakani, a fundamentalist member of parliament from Tehran, who had warned the assembly of \u201ca possibly tacit crossing of the red line that will undoubtedly lead to a defeat for Iran\u2019s national rights and a serious setback for our many nuclear achievements thus far.\u201d Also responding to Zakani\u2019s remarks has been Marzieh Afkham, foreign ministry spokeswoman. She insisted that \u201cthe negotiation team is completely aware of the red line and is acting with care and sensitivity to respect it\u201d. She implicitly threatened Zakani with legal action over his \u201csmear\u201d and accused him of being \u201cdisrespectful of the broader effort by the country\u2019s leadership to improve the situation at home for all Iranians.\u201d But no matter how often Zarif and his team have insisted they have kept Ayatollah Khamenei informed throughout the negotiations, the media barrage has continued. Ramze Obour, a fundamentalist weekly magazine, also took up the idea of Iran\u2019s negotiators as thespians, headlining a special report on the negotiations \u201cThe actors and their final mission\u201d. This explicitly targeted former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is close to president Hassan Rouhani and many of the Iranian negotiating team, and rings with a desire to settle old, lingering scores. \u201cIn the past few years, Mr Rafsanjani has always talked about a letter he wrote in 1988 to Imam [Ruhollah] Khomeini [supreme leader until his death in 1989] in which he beseeched the founder of the Islamic Revolution to solve the problem of Iran\u2019s relations with the US during his lifetime, arguing that no one else would be able to do so after his death. Even in the aftermath of the weak agreement reached in Geneva during the first 100 days of Rouhani\u2019s presidency [the November 2013 interim agreement], which has resulted in an overall loss for the country and has even made the negotiators\u2019 job more difficult, Mr Rafsanjani holds on to this cherished memory. It seems as though his only wish - or perhaps, it could be said, his sole mission in life - is to see Iran in a permanent relationship with the US.\u201d A member of Moharekat (Participation Front), the main reformist political party, told Tehran Bureau these fundamentalist attacks were predictable and cautioned against exaggerating their importance. \u201cThis is all very natural. They are betting on the eventual paralysis of the Rouhani government, and their most important card is his defeat in these nuclear negotiations. They know that if the negotiations fail, further sanctions will kick in, economic stagnation will worsen, and they will reap the benefits of widespread public disenchantment.\u201d But the Mosharekat member insisted the fundamentalists were not driving the process. \u201cThese articles don\u2019t really bear on the decisions of the current government. The main deciders are Ayatollah Khamenei, president Rouhani, the higher-ups at the Revolutionary Guards, and maybe [parliamentary speaker] Ali Larijani. The big decisions simply aren\u2019t made or even affected by the fundamentalist press.\u201d But there is nervousness in Tehran. A year ago, Ayatollah Khamenei came out in strong support of the negotiating team during a speech on the anniversary of the storming of the US embassy in Tehran. Now, as the November deadline draws ever nearer, Khamenei\u2019s website has published an expression of thanks to the leader from deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, for his \u201ceffective and heartwarming\u201d support, and a Twitter account associated with the leader has expressed support for \u201cinnovative diplomacy in foreign policy and international affairs\u201d. But Khamenei himself has maintained a silence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
