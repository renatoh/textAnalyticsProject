Butland fractured his right ankle close to half-time of the 3-2 victory over Germany in Berlin on 26 March. The player left on a stretcher and was forced to miss the European Championship in France. He was, however, expected to return for Stoke\u2019s first Premier League match of the season, at Middlesbrough, but aggravated the ankle just 24 hours before that game and has suffered a number of setbacks to his recovery since. A further operation last month was intended to mean a return to action in March, but Hughes, speaking after Stoke\u2019s 4-2 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday, and in the context of tieing up a long-term deal for loanee goalkeeper Lee Grant, said the 23-year-old may not play again during the current campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s a priority for us because we\u2019re in a little bit of a situation with Jack Butland being unavailable for any number of months and he might not come back this season,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cHe may well get back April/May time, we\u2019re not sure. But we\u2019re more comfortable with his situation now and understand what the problems have been. So he\u2019ll be fine when he gets back.\u201d Butland was in excellent form for Stoke before his injury and was deemed a certain member of Roy Hodgson\u2019s squad for Euro 2016. Sam Allardyce was also known to view Butland as a serious contender to Joe Hart as England\u2019s No1 during his brief spell in charge of the national team. Having managed Butland while in charge of England Under-21s, Gareth Southgate may well be keen to involve him at senior level, and would have potentially been able to do so for the friendly away to Germany on 22 March and World Cup qualifier at home to Lithuania four days later. However, the earliest Southgate might be able to select Butland is likely to be for the qualifier against Scotland at Hampden Park on 10 June. In Butland\u2019s absence, Grant, 33, has impressed following his arrival from Derby County at the end of August. He made another string of eye-catching saves at Stamford Bridge and is expected shortly to turn his loan deal into a transfer, thought to be in the region of \u00a31.5m. Derby had originally wanted closer to \u00a34m for the player. \u201cWe lost Jack the Friday before the first game of the season so had to move quickly,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cThankfully our goalkeeping coach Andy Quy had worked with Lee at Derby, so he knew him. It was still a risk. He\u2019d had 300-odd games at a good level but had never played in the Premier League. But credit to him, he\u2019s proven he\u2019s a Premier League keeper.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
