All days feel the same when you are a comedian. I\u2019m up at 9am if I\u2019m feeling hard-working. If I didn\u2019t set an alarm I think I\u2019d sleep forever. And that\u2019s how I\u2019d die. A day out? I prefer not to leave the house \u2013 I\u2019m a homebody, really. When you work in the arts you can convince yourself that watching TV is professional development. My favourite Sundays are the ones spent recovering from an intense Saturday night. People always complain about hangovers, but I enjoy feeling tender and reflective. Do you work? Sometimes I\u2019ll gig locally. But Sunday shows feel more chilled, so often I\u2019d test new material. What were Sundays like as a kid? Growing up in Malaysia there was a lot of pressure to be religious. My parents took me to church on Sundays, but that didn\u2019t work out. Once that was out the way, I just played video games in the basement. The taste of Sunday? Laksa from this shop on Gaya Street in my hometown of Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia. There\u2019s a big Sunday market to weave through before you get there. We went back over Christmas \u2013 it\u2019s still delicious. You used to have to fight for a table, but they\u2019ve got a bouncer now. Do you ever cook? I live with my sister and we\u2019d often have people over for dinner. I like to take too much on and start screaming in the kitchen when our guests arrive. I\u2019ve done all sorts: cod with capers and dill; confit duck and steak fiorentina. Netflix have a one hour-long fireplace programme: I whack it on by the table. The birchwood edition is only for special occasions. And what about Sunday night? There\u2019s no routine, no preparing for the week ahead \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019d have anything to do Monday morning anyway. Sunday might be my Saturday night, but there\u2019d be nobody to go to the pub with. You choose a lonely, poetic life as a comedian. It has ups and downs. philwang.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
