In her final practice she finished fourth at Utah Olympic Park yesterday. The RAF intelligence officer led after the first run but slipped back in the second to finish 0.18sec behind the United States' Lea Ann Parsley. \"The Olympics is no different from any other, you can have one little bit of bad luck, or one small mistake, or one piece of good luck,\" said Coomber. \"If I think about losing I may as well not turn up.\" On Coomber's side is class. She has won the overall World Cup circuit for three consecutive years and triumphed in a race on this course last winter. \"I will get nervous, I always do but I turn this nervous energy into something positive,\" said the 28-year-old from Shepton Mallet. \"Generally the bigger the race, the better I do. \"There are a lot of psychological games before the race. People think about start numbers, new runners, new suits, new helmets, but I'm sticking to the formula which has helped me win over the last few years.\" After the September 11 atrocity Parsley has emerged as the sentimental favourite here. Parsley was the Ohio firefighter of the year in 1999 and works as a nurse in Columbus. She was also the fastest in practice on Sunday, when Coomber finished fifth. Coomber still believes Maya Pedersen, Switzerland's two-time world champion, poses just as potent a threat in this fledgling sport which has been among the most keenly anticipated here. That is despite the fact that, with only 13 competitors, it is one of the smallest held in the games' 78-year history. Coomber said of Pedersen: \"She's a good athlete, a good slider. In the race she is my No1 enemy. After the race she is my best friend. I wouldn't want to win a race if I knew the rest of the field were absolutely hopeless. What would be the point of that?\" Coomber has been attracting so much media interest during the run-up to these games that she has recently launched her own website, but she is generally uncomfortable in the full glare of publicity. \"I'd rather not have publicity but I have to come terms with it,\" she said. \"I don't have an obsession with Olympic gold. I've proved myself over the years I've competed and I will go into next year as the world's No1 whatever happens.\" She has been flooded with good-luck messages, including one from the former world superbike champion Carl Fogarty, after he read in the Guardian that she had named her dog after him. Coomber has missed \"Foggy\" so much that she has been speaking to him on the phone while she has been away. The British team, which has already suffered plenty of disappointments here, will hope that tonight she will have a gold medal to tell him about. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
