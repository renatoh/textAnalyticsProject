There was no self-indulgence, just the desire to give himself over to the contest. This trait, so redolent of hearty British football, is now one of his great assets. On his competitive debut for the Spanish champions it was clear immediately that Beckham will have no difficulty with the crowd. The Madrid fans are a tough audience and, when things go marginally wrong, they treat booing as a birthright, but they are already charmed by Beckham's readiness to immerse himself in the action. That characterisation of him is not intended as a backhanded compliment. This was a good debut from a newcomer in a foreign country who has only just had the first of the Spanish lessons that are now meant to occupy him for an hour a day. Apart from the goal, he used the ball well and glowed with a sense of belonging when he and Zinedine Zidane batted the ball back and forth between them for a few second-half moments. He had been admitted into the fellowship. With just a single proper match completed no one can guess how large his part in Madrid's history will eventually be. On Saturday he simply did the right thing and did it frequently. Betis thought highly enough of the display to kick him now and again. Beckham regarded it as an initiation ceremony. \"I saw them having a dig at Ronaldo so it was nice to be in that sort of company,\" he said. The midfielder belonged there. The assignment of shooting into an empty net from Ronaldo's expert cut-back after two minutes was a sinecure, but Beckham had already made a textbook manoeuvre by haring in from the blindside to get ahead of the defender at the far post. It was all sublimely simple and he is among team-mates who can make a player look very good. The move had started with Zidane wheeling and putting a pinpoint pass to Ronaldo, who then got to the byline after an interchange of passes with Raul. With such openings Beckham will revel in life at Madrid. At the weekend he admitted at last to the shipwreck of his relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson, but there were positive reasons as well for getting out of Old Trafford. Since Madrid have been Champions League winners on a biennial basis since 1998 it is indisputable that his transfer has been a promotion. Despite his club's ascendancy Spanish football will stretch him. \"Joaquin is much better than Beckham and I'm not just saying that because he's my friend,\" the Betis midfielder Capi said before Saturday's match. The young winger, who is often linked with Manchester United, equalised with a free header from a corner-kick in the 34th minute and certainly stood comparison with the Englishman. Defeat was unjust for a good Betis side. \"There's so many great teams and players in this league that there aren't many easy games and that makes you a better player,\" said Beckham. Perhaps there will be some severe honing when Madrid go to Villareal on Tuesday but he will then join the England squad as quickly as possible. His club have chartered a plane that will take him to the training camp in Manchester immediately after the match. The logistical inconveniences will not perturb Sven-Goran Eriksson if Beckham improves in Madrid. \"I'd like to find out how to play better football,\" Beckham said, and there will be much for him to fathom at the Bernabeu. After the interval he came inside far more. He later explained that this was because the coach Carlos Queiroz wanted to close the gaps in midfield, but Real never really dig in. They are not cut out for trench warfare. Negligence in defence is generally overcome because of the improvisational scope of their loose organisation. \"If our players are in certain parts of the field it's because they think that's the best place to be,\" the substitute Santiago Solari said. \"Freedom must have a starting point in intelligence. Otherwise it's a mess. This is not a mess.\" Beckham, hitting the bar with a superb 30-yarder, caught the mood of a team that depends on virtuosity more than discipline. The winner was superb, with Beckham picking out Zidane and Ronaldo crashing home his cross. Whatever else happens the England captain will never be bored at the Bernabeu. Man of the match. Zinedine Zidane (Real Madrid)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
