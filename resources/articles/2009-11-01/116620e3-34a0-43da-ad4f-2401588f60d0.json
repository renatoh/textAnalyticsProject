It's nonsense, of course, because everyone collects, but there is no drama at all. Denman's performance in the Hennessy Gold Cup showed how a favourite should really win, for the punters and for the sport. Brave, strong and radiating power and intent, he pounded out his second victory in this race with top weight of 11st 12lb on his back. There have been few more impressive successes in a handicap in the last 20 years, and the jubilation on Newbury's normally staid members' lawn told its own story. Two years ago, Denman drifted in the on-course market to start at 5-1. This time, he attracted relentless support, from 7-2 to 11-4, and once he had warmed to his task over the first few fences, the first he had seen in public since falling at Aintree in the spring, Denman and Ruby Walsh were always up with the pace and pouring on the pressure. Denman was giving at least a stone to most of the field and inevitably there were a few who managed to lie up with him. Barber's Shop in particular was going well to the home turn, but his stamina gave way soon afterwards, leaving What A Friend, his stablemate, as the main danger with two to jump. The sub-plot was fascinating, as What A Friend - part-owned by Sir Alex Ferguson - was ridden by Sam Thomas, who was Denman's jockey two years ago but is a rare partner for a Paul Nicholls-trained horse these days. But while he had 22lb less than Denman on his back, What A Friend did not have the favourite's grit in the closing stages and the favourite ran on into a gale of noise to win by three and a half lengths. The winner's part-owner Harry Findlay, some of whose money was behind the late gamble on Denman, was in his usual raucous form, but Nicholls was in a more reflective mood, clearly moved by the enormity of the nine-year-old's achievement. Last season, it seemed that a heart problem might end Denman's career. Now, Nicholls has him back to his best and on course for a third, decisive meeting with Kauto Star, his next-door neighbour at the yard, in March's Gold Cup. \"This was one of those great moments that I'll never forget,\" Nicholls said. \"He worked last Saturday with Big Buck's [the easy winner of the Long Distance Hurdle earlier on the card] and then again on Wednesday and he made him really go. He had to be somewhere near where he used to be to work that well, and after Big Buck's won today I said to Ruby, this horse can't be far off. \"But to win with that weight with the problems he's had is a monumental achievement for 'Team Ditcheat'. I'm the front man, but there's so manypeople involved, it's just awesome.\" Findlay suggested afterwards that if Denman turns up at Cheltenham in March in the same kind of form, \"he'll win the Gold Cup pulling a cart\". It is unlikely to be quite that easy, but it was still a surprise to find one bookie, SkyBet, quoting 11-4 for the Gold Cup afterwards. Ladbrokes, who go 2-1 about Denman and Kauto Star and then 8-1 bar, are much closer to the mark. Denman is a possible runner in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown next month, two days after Kauto Star contests the King George at Kempton on Boxing Day, but Nicholls will not run him in Ireland if the ground is too demanding and may instead give Denman just one more outing, in the Aon Chase back at Newbury, before Cheltenham. Nicholls is now a heavy odds-on chance to win the Gold Cup, while Big Buck's is evens for the World Hurdle after cantering all over a decent field. The Champion Hurdle market, though, is much more open, afterBinocular's dismal failure to justify a short price in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle yesterday. Solwhit, another leading contender, was also well beaten as Go Native, last season's SupremeNovice Hurdle winner, recorded an easy success. Noel Meade's six-year-old is now a big-looking 12-1 for the Champion, with Binocular, Solwhit and Zaynar vying for favouritism at around 5-1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
