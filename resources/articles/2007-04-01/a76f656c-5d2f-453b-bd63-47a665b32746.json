The CBI's monthly snapshot of industry reported that UK factories were comfortably shrugging off the impact of a stronger pound and using the strength of demand - at home and abroad - to raise prices. Ian McCafferty, the CBI's chief economist, said: \"I think it's pretty inevitable that we are going to have a rate rise, if not next month then soon after.\" He added that mounting inflationary pressures justified a fourth rate rise even before the release of figures last week which showed inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, at 3.1%. Despite the upbeat tone, the CBI said it saw no reason at present why rates needed to go up by more than a quarter point. Previous rises had yet to have their full effect, and fears of a wage-price spiral had so far proved groundless, Mr McCafferty said. Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, signalled to MPs yesterday that the Bank was ready to raise rates next month, saying: \"We are completely determined to bring inflation back to target. That's our purpose in life.\" Giving evidence to the Treasury select committee, Mr King said that as last year's big rise in energy bills was reversed, there could be a \"quite sharp fall\" in inflation over the next four to six months, but that the Bank had to \"look through the fog\" to the medium-term prospects. The governor, who was forced to write an explanatory letter to Gordon Brown after inflation moved more than a percentage point over the government's 2% target, rejected suggestions that the Bank had allowed excess growth in money and credit, which had fuelled inflation. \"In a global capital market where money can move freely, what determines asset prices in the UK is very much what is happening in the world market. And in the last few years there's been a real sharp fall in risk premium around the world and that has driven up asset prices.\" The CBI said growth in manufacturers' new orders was - apart from a short period in 2004 - the strongest in a decade, while the number of CBI members citing a lack of orders or sales as a constraint on output was the smallest since early 1989. With cheaper energy prices, the survey found that unit costs for industry were rising at their slowest in two years, and firms were taking the opportunity to rebuild their profit margins. Strong demand has failed to stem job losses in manufacturing, the CBI said. It estimated that the number employed in industry fell 25,000 in the first quarter of 2007 and a further 30,000 decline was likely for the second quarter. \"Last year's profits squeeze, in which manufacturers had to absorb sharply rising costs, with no hope of passing them on to the marketplace, is now being reversed,\" Mr McCafferty said. \"Cost pressures are finally easing and firms are managing to increase prices and restore battered profit margins. The strength of the pound has not yet hit export orders. Firms remain positive about the prospects for overseas demand and still hope to raise prices for exports as well as domestic goods.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
