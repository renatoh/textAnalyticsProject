In what Labor and the Greens are calling the latest move in an increasingly secret culture surrounding immigration policy, a list of all briefings to the immigration minister was requested under freedom-of-information laws from the Immigration Department but the titles of all Morrison\u2019s briefings have been redacted under the laws. When the Labor government was in office, a list of briefings from 1 July to 15 August was publicly released by the department, detailing a number of meetings the then immigration minister, Tony Burke, had attended. The acting shadow immigration minister, Michelle Rowland, said: \u201cThere is no doubt the Coalition government has gone to extraordinary lengths to hide information from Australians who are still waiting for the accountability and transparency they were promised by the Coalition before the election.\u201d \u201cThe one thing these documents do make clear is the ongoing contempt of the Abbott government for open and transparent government. Australians have a right to know what is happening. The Coalition can\u2019t keep hiding the truth.\u201d Guardian Australia asked the immigration minister whether his office had any influence over the FOI decision. A spokeswoman for the minister said FOI matters are handled by the department. But the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said the Immigration Department\u2019s release of information had clearly been affected under the Abbott government. \u201cPrevious FOI requests showed an increasing reluctance to reveal information from the Immigration Department, but that has increased significantly under the Abbott government. Failing to uphold the objectives of the FOI Act will have regrettable and serious long-term implications for transparent governance in Australia,\u201d she said. A spokeswoman for the Immigration Department said: \u201cThe department has established procedures to help us make fair and consistent decisions about requests for information under FOI.\u201d \u201cThe department prides itself on a robust and impartial FOI process.\u201d Information about immigration matters has been heavily muted by the Abbott government, justified because it relates to \u201coperational matters\u201d. Boat arrivals are no longer reported as they happen, and instead the minister holds weekly news conferences on Friday afternoons. Those conferences now also appear to be in doubt, with Morrison refusing to confirm whether they will continue in 2014."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
