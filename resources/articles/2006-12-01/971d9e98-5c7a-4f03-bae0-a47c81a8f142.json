I've had the flu, I think. I've been keeping up with the work, pretty much, because we can view our lectures online. The lecturers but up the PowerPoint slides and you can go through them. So I've been doing that on the odd days I've had to miss college, and that's been really good - I would have got behind otherwise. Surprisingly, the lectures are still pretty much full all the time. You hear stories about how at every lecture there are fewer people. But in our course, even though you can look at them online, people still turn up. I think it's because they're really interesting. And obviously you can only learn a certain amount from looking at slides. If you're there in person you can see the lecturer explaining what each one is about, so it's better to go. This term, we've been doing programming in Java, web design in HTML, operating systems in networks - the full range. It's really practical, too. After the lectures there's an hour-long workshop on what we've been learning about. To actually do it really helps you to understand it. The work's been fine. It's still the first year so I doubt it would be that heavy for anyone. I have lectures four days out of five and then the rest of the time I'll do some studying at home. It's workable. One of the projects we've had to do this term is building a website. We were given topics by our tutors. Mine was a website about building a website, if that makes sense. It was really just to see how well we understood the information we'd been getting in the lectures. We've had a few tests, too, just to find out how we're getting on, one for each module. So we always have to be on top of what we've learned, but I suppose that's for the best. I think we're getting our marks back for those this week. And choosing our modules for next semester, too. I've stopped driving to college. It was easier to get the train. So now I get it from Birmingham New Street to Wolverhampton. It only takes 12 minutes; driving was about half an hour. And I had to find somewhere to park. I don't mind not being on campus. Obviously it would be different if I was there all the time and living in halls but I still have time to socialise. After lectures, I stay to make some notes or do some work and then I can go to the union and see people. I don't really need to spend that much time in the library. We've got a few books to read but most of the things we do are on the computer, so it's really easy to do it at home. There are really good resources and everything's available online. We've only got a couple of weeks left before the end of term. It's gone really, really quickly. It feels like we've only just started and now this bit's almost over. I'm going to spend a bit of time over Christmas catching up with some work, and then just relax. I might go on holiday, possibly abroad. It's not that I feel like I really need the rest, but while I've got the opportunity to go, I might as well. Matthew Holehouse is studying modern history at The Queen's College, Oxford Matthew's term has already finished - and he is absolutely exhausted. Last Thursday was the end-of-term party, and it went on until 3am. The next day he had his last tutorial and a meeting at the student newspaper. His first term has been intense. Tom Albone is studying business information systems at Sheffield Hallam University Tom is very busy at the moment. It's mainly work but everyone's getting excited about Christmas too. He thinks he and his flatmates will be having some kind of Christmas celebration before the end of term. He's also started house hunting for somewhere to live in his second year. The good houses go quickly, so you might as well get in there early."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
