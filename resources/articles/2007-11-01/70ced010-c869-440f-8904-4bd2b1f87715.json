Sweaty or dry? Manual work, skin condition and age all affect the quality of your fingerprints, along with simpler things like pressing too hard or from an odd angle. But with the increasing use of fingerprint readers for biometric systems, correctly identifying your fingerprints is essential. And it's not as easy as you might think. Fingerprints are often incomplete or distorted. The same finger can give slightly different results every time. Pressing down and rotating your finger against a hard surface will distort the print, while a light touch means less of a print remains. Dr Li Wang, a researcher in the University of Warwick's department of computer science, has devised a new means of identifying partial, distorted, scratched or smudged fingerprints in just seconds. Rather than finding a match by comparing a dozen or so features - the so-called points of comparison - his new system examines the whole print, regardless of how complete it is. From this, it digitises as much of the information from the fingerprint as possible. Fixing flaws Wang explains: \"Even if it's the same data, it sometimes looks different and this is the technical constraint for the biometric industry. If you can minimise that constraint, you can improve accuracy.\" Wang has worked with two other researchers at Warwick, Professor Roland Wilson and Dr Abhir Bhalerao, to develop a set of software algorithms to fix common fingerprint flaws by transforming the fingerprint pattern into a standard coordinate system. Wang calls this process \"unwarping\": it removes smudging, uneven pressure and other distortions. A clear digital representation of the fingerprint is then easily matched against a database of all other unwarped fingerprints by comparing digital signatures. \"Unwarping is the best lay term we can find to describe the approach,\" says Wang. Is it a big breakthrough? \"We would like to believe so.\" This mathematically based process is so effective that it's possible to compare the position of the hundreds of individual sweat pores packed in a fingerprint. What's more, identification takes place in seconds, regardless of the database size, whether one print or a million. And it doesn't require vast processing power: Wang runs the system on his laptop. This summer, Wang and his colleagues took the system to London's Science Museum for three days of public hands-on (or perhaps one should say fingers-on) testing. \"We tested our system on nearly 500 visitors and achieved 100% accuracy,\" says Wang. \"Children often tend to twist their finger when placing the finger on the scanner, creating an elastic deformation which provides a great testing ground for our technology.\" The children were asked to provide an initial fingerprint sample, and a few seconds later, the researchers were able to test if the print was recognised by the system. Assisted by Mathematical Capital, a new venture capital group which helps good mathematical ideas become companies, Wang, Wilson and Bhalerao have established a spinout company called Warwick Warp. While refining their prototype, they're exploring commercial opportunities such as access control, financial transaction authorisation and identity cards. While the technology at present is primarily aimed at commercial functions, the company hopes to work with any ID card contractor appointed by the government. Meanwhile, the ability to identify partial prints from crime scenes has also attracted interest from law-enforcement agencies. Inherent flaws Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, sees fingerprints as an important biometric tool, but also appreciates their inherent flaws. In his book, Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems, he describes how a half-inch scar on his finger crashed an FBI building entry control scanner. \"The problem with fingerprints as a biometric is that they're just not precise enough,\" says Anderson. \"Fingerprints can give you some benefits in authentication systems but the limitation is the equal error rate of a few per cent.\" The equal error rate is the point where the false accept (letting the wrong person in) and false reject (keeping the right person out) rates for automatic authentication are equal; 1% is a very good figure. Anderson says that improvements in fingerprint recognition algorithms are always welcome but points out that other, perhaps less convenient, biometric methods such as iris recognition already offer better results. There is, of course, a big difference between fingerprint evidence given by experts to convict people and a fingerprint used for access to a building or to authorise a transaction. No matter how good or fast automatic recognition technology becomes, correcting some biometric mistakes may be lot easier than others."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
