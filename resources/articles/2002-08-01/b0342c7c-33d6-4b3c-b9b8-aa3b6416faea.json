Instead, it's what they reach for thankfully before they set off on their travels, and later regurgitate. It begins as stodgily as a text book, and it finishes as briskly as one might expect of an author who has been the BBC's World Service correspondent in Central Asia for much of the past 10 years. It is well informed and highly illuminating about a part of the world that grabs our attention only when it is on the receiving end of various imperial instincts. Little attention is paid to London's long history of involvement in these bruising encounters. You will not find any reference here to Stoddart and Conolly's brutal end in 19th-century Bukhara, or to the \"great game\". Nor is there a lyrical description of the breathtakingly vivid Registan in Samarkand, or more than a passing reference to Tamurlaine the Great, whose unostentatious tomb lies in a quiet backwater of that city. There is a great deal of history in Whitlock's work, but it is the history of Russian activity in the area, and also of the latter-day American meddling. Her book is principally about the former Russian possessions north of the mighty river that Alexander the Great knew as the Oxus (now the Amu Darya). Generations of refugees from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have struggled across the Amu to the Islamic sanctuary of Afghanistan, which looms invitingly or threateningly across the water. The colonising from which they fled was begun by the tsars in the 18th century and ratified by the Bolsheviks after the revolution. These were not obviously improving influences such as - up to a point - the British inflicted upon India. Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Kirgizstan, as well as the lands of the Uzbeks and the Tajiks, were regarded by all Russians as the most backward and benighted parts of their empire; and for its endemic corruptions, Uzbekistan also became known as the sewer of the entire Soviet Union. Nothing much was ever done to raise the Central Asians above this abysmal level. As late as 1924, there were only two cars in Tajikistan. \"We were the trash at the bottom of the heap\" even in the 1980s, according to a man who had wanted to be a doctor but spent his life as a labourer. Soviet Central Asia was simply the place where thousands of local highlanders were deported to the flatlands to break in new ground for cotton plantation; where loyal Soviet citizens of distant German origin were dumped far from their homes when the second world war began so that they couldn't possibly collaborate with the Nazis; where prison camps as dreadful as any Siberian gulag were established in the middle of wastelands. It was the perfect springboard for the invasion of Afghanistan, though it provided less cannon fodder than might have been expected when the Soviet generals decided that too many of their Asian conscripts had divided loyalties. The independence of the new republics, as Whitlock demonstrates, has brought their people little respite. Since 1991, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have been in a chaos of internecine violence, where how you pronounce \"potato\" might mean the difference between life and death (it betrays your ethnic status), and where, according to a UN estimate, between June 1992 and February 1993, as many as 60,000 people may have been slaughtered in a Tadjik civil war, which cost one town 93% of its population. The appearance of the Taliban across the river only destabilised the region further: they were hailed as saviours by some Central Asians, and as unbalanced fanatics by others. Things have been so awful that an old and faithful Muslim in Dushanbe told Whitlock one day: \"I was sorry that the Russians left. They knew how to do things and they helped us build a country. They were good people. Everyone is sorry now, but it is too late.\" The Central Asians may have exchanged one form of domination for another. The overt appearance of the Americans in the region did not begin with carpet-bombing by B52s over Afghanistan in 2001, but the day in 1997 when 500 US troops parachuted into Uzbekistan (courtesy of President Karimov) after flying nonstop from Fort Bragg on an exercise. And so the imperial hegemony goes on and on into an indefinite future. \u00b7 Geoffrey Moorhouse is the author of Apples in the Snow: A Journey to Samarkand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
