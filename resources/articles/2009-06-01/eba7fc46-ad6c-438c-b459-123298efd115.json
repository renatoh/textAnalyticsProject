Last night we arrived in Cape Town for game five of the tour, knowing it will be tougher than anything that has gone before \u2013 that almost goes unsaid in this country \u2013 but with our confidence and motivation up another rung to match. We keep being told that our, or rather Ian McGeechan's master plan \u2013 not to play the Test team together until we meet the Springboks in Durban a week tomorrow \u2013 is a novelty and a gamble but we don't see it that way. What we are doing seems logical given the time restraints and in any case I have a sneaky feeling that this is how McGeechan went about the job in 1997 as well. The way things are, modern tours have to be pretty slim affairs. So the planning is rather different from the days when battalions of players boarded grand liners, kissed their wives and babies goodbye and didn't see their children again until they were practically grown up. Our bottom line was that we had about seven weeks to put together a side to play the world champions \u2013 a side that has probably taken seven years to get to where it is today \u2013 and that everyone selected to tour would be given the chance of making the Test 22. That was the promise given to the players when we left London and that's what we will stick to throughout the tour. The Test team will not be chosen until the Tuesday before Durban and until then every one is in with an equal chance, which is why tomorrow's game against Western Province at Newlands ratchets up the ante yet again. So far the midweek sides have had a huge advantage, if only because they have played in the cool of the evenings. But against Western Province any one of the match-day 22 can get himself into the Test squad. All the matches so far have been different, not only because of the circumstances, like altitude or heat or the quality of the opposition, but also because we are getting progressively further and further down the path we have charted for ourselves. Game by game we have tried different combinations \u2013 for example it was really important that Ronan O'Gara had a start with Mike Phillips inside him and Jamie Roberts and Brian O'Driscoll outside, which is what happened in Durban on Wednesday night \u2013 but watching matches alone, you get half the story. What you don't see is what is happening on the training paddock. At the very start Ian made it absolutely clear that every single training session is about beating the Springboks, not Western Province, the Cheetahs or any other side put up against us. In fact we are not doing a lot of analysis or research on the sides we will meet on the way to the first Test \u2013 almost nothing by the standards of a normal Test week \u2013 because beating them is not the main objective. Everything we work on, every move we practise, every tactical switch in emphasis is about the Boks and only the Boks. I have to admit that it would be hard to find footage of some of the sides we are facing even if we wanted it, but that is not dismissing what has gone before lightly. On Wednesday night the Sharks may have been short of a few backs, but they were far from as toothless as some have suggested. That was a decent pack and there were some mutterings before the game that it might be stronger in some respects than the one the Boks are likely to amass. I'll take that with a large pinch of salt, but it was nevertheless very nice to hear the view of the Sharks coach, John Plumtree, who compared us more than favourably with the 2005 Lions. And Plumtree should know what he's talking about \u2013 four years ago, he coached Wellington and gave Clive Woodward's tourists a decent game. Mind you, I have to admit that Plumtree, too, questioned whether we might be a little \"undercooked\" for Durban a week tomorrow. All I can say is that we are confident we won't be. OK, it might have been nice to have a couple more games, but then, would we have been satisfied with that? The whole point about the Lions is that they are a \"scratch\" side, four countries hopefully blended into one in not much more than the blink of an eye. They are wonderful for it. I'd also point out that the Boks aren't having too much game time together either."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
