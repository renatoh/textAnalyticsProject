We wish to make it clear that Mr Bamford was not involved in sectarian abuse of Trevor Brennan and we unreservedly apologise to Mr Bamford. We said in an article about the collapse of the Christmas savings club Farepak that the administrators had already charged \u00a32.7m. The administrators' fees amount to about \u00a3633,000 of that total; the rest is payments made as part of the administration (There is no Northern Rock rescuer for subprime savers, page 31, November 13). The POUM (Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista) was not a \"rebel socialist army\" during the Spanish civil war as it was described in a book excerpt published in G2 on November 14 (I love poor people - they know where the drugs are, page 11). Although the POUM organised a militia, it was a political party, not an army, and it supported the Popular Front government of the republic against the military uprising led by Franco. In 20m reasons to ignore Dubai's rotten record of exploitation, page 7, Sport, November 15, we said that Jimmy Hill fought to abolish football's minimum wage. We meant \"maximum wage\"; there were limits to what players could earn at the time. \u00b7 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.
