An article about Jersey's claim to be the warmest place \"in the British Isles\" \u2013 Scilly pours cold water on Jersey's warmer boast, 11 April, page 7 \u2013 rendered the island's mean minimum temperature of 8.9C as (a freezing) 32F. That should have been 48.2F. Elsewhere on the same page, a report noted the record high for an April day recorded at Santon Downham which lies just in Suffolk on the Norfolk/Suffolk border, not, as we had it, in Norfolk itself (UK basks in sunshine and fumes in traffic, 11 April, page 7). \u2022 Our obituary of the singer Johnny Preston described the song Endless Sleep as a \"death disc\", despite the fact that it had a happy ending when the singer saved his girl from drowning. The piece also erred when it stated that the Preston hit Running Bear influenced the sound of Jonathan King's record Hooked On A Feeling. (Obituaries, 7 March, page 35). \u2022 Reviewing Wastwater, a play at the Royal Court theatre, London, we described the lake of the title as the deepest in Britain. That should have been the deepest in England. When Britain is the area of reference, notes a reader, \"scores of Scottish Lochs are much deeper than that beautifully bleak lake in Cumbria\" (Sinister shadows that make the flesh creep, but to what end? 6 April, page 38)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
