Bubb will leave in June to head up the Charity Futures Programme (CFP) \u2013 a project that will research and develop new ways of securing strong governance and leadership in the sector. \u201cI am proud to have spent the last 15 years leading Acevo into the 21st century. Much has been achieved in driving a modern professional third sector,\u201d Bubb said. \u201cBut we all know that the negative attention of recent times has made us look at whether our leadership and governance is as good as it must be. It is now time for me to focus on this, the most important strategic issue facing the sector.\u201d The CFP, which will be run by Acevo, has been funded by an anonymous philanthropist who offered to help after hearing Bubb talk about the collapse of Kids Company on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme. It will examine all roles in the sector \u2013 from donors to executive level \u2013 and look at how the sector can achieve long-term stability. \u201cThe \u2018golden rule\u2019 of charity funding is that frontline delivery begins in the back office. No charity can deliver effective services at the frontline without a strong and professional team at the top,\u201d Bubb said. \u201cTo make that rule a reality, we need to build the leadership and governance support our sector needs but which funding does not always support.\u201d The CFP will initially run for two years, but Bubb told the Guardian Voluntary Sector Network that he has \u201cbig plans\u201d to secure additional funding from philanthropists, foundations and government. Paul Farmer, the chairman of Acevo, said: \u201cThe end of his tenure as Acevo\u2019s chief executive is the end of an era. He has already made a huge contribution to our sector, and will continue to do so in this new role.\u201d Acevo\u2019s director of public policy, Asheem Singh, will assume the role of chief executive while the organisation recruits a replacement.
