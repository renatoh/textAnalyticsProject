The idea is contained in a paper published yesterday by the prime minister's own think-tank, the performance and innovation unit. The paper proposes that a \"challenge team\" be set up at the centre of government, \"largely made up of people with proven experience of delivery, to test and probe departmental plans and report on deliverability and potential risks\". The report complains that now departmental ideas are only examined by the Treasury to test their cost, or subsequently if the policy has failed. The PIU report, largely written by its director Geoff Mulgan, also suggests the Whitehall centre could provide advice on implementation and timescales, and urges ministers to cut the number of initiatives. It says \"policy makers and ministers should be ruthlessly economical with goals .. for any initiative.\" A separate report from the PIU also published yesterday admits there is a crisis of leadership quality in the public services, and more work needs to be done to raise morale. The report concedes: \"The public services are not attracting or keeping the best leaders, and do not have sufficiently robust strategies for recruiting them to the posts that matter most; jobs and careers in the public services are undervalued, and top leadership jobs are, arguably, underpaid. Too few organisations seek actively to recruit the best leaders\". The report suggests that \"human resources problems threaten to be the biggest impediment to successful delivery in the next 5-10 years\". It suggests amongst senior managers base pay rates in the wider public sector are roughly 25-30% below the comparable private sector rate and civil service rates (for those in executive agency postings) 40-50% below."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
