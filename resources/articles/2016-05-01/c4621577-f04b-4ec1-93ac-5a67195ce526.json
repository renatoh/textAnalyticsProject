Far from being daunted, she posed with \u201cno vanity whatsoever\u201d because it was an honour to be painted by arguably Britain\u2019s foremost contemporary artist, who routinely turns down portrait commissions. Devaney was one of 82 sitters \u2013 family members, friends and associates \u2013 who have posed for Hockney in his Los Angeles studio over the past two-and-a-half years. They include well-known figures such as Barry Humphries, the artist\u2019s siblings John and Margaret, his housekeeper and a fridge repair man. The portraits \u2013 and a still life painted during one missed sitting \u2013 will be displayed in a major exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts (RA) in London this summer, ahead of a Hockney retrospective at the Tate next year. Devaney is the show\u2019s curator. Having her portrait painted was an unexpected perk. She had never been painted before and was taken aback when she visited his studio and he said: \u201cI\u2019d like you to sit for me.\u201d Coming face to face with her painted likeness, she says she saw herself in a new light. She was struck by a seriousness of expression that her mother recognised instantly, but which she had not noticed from photographs or the mirror. Nor was she aware that her pose \u2013 leaning forward with her head in her hand \u2013 is one she adopts when engrossed in conversation. It was pointed out to her later by one of Hockney\u2019s assistants. \u201cIn an age of the selfie, and endless meaningless portraits \u2026 it\u2019s interesting how little we know ourselves,\u201d she told the Observer. Hockney is the Bradford boy who set off for Los Angeles and found inspiration in the American dream, swimming pools and sunlight. A Bigger Splash, his 1967 image of a pool and an unseen diver, is among his best-known paintings. He was made a Royal Academician in 1991, and his 2012 show of East Yorkshire landscapes, curated by Devaney, was a big success, attracting more than 600,000 visitors. Each of the portraits in his new RA show was created within three days, on a canvas 122x91cm, and with each sitter on the same upholstered chair against a neutral background. Hockney painted them using acrylics, partly because they are quick-drying, and he views the series as a single work. He has long experimented with photography and new technology, but told Devaney that the camera cannot convey the intense emotion of a painted portrait. He would start work around 9am and continue until late afternoon in his studio, an airy space flooded with Los Angeles light. It is \u201cvery orderly\u201d, Devaney said: \u201cThe canvas is ready and the paints are all out.\u201d The studio doors tend to be open and he paints to the sound of birds in the garden. There were no preparatory drawings. Hockney drew a charcoal outline straight on to the canvas before painting. He created two portraits of her (although only one will be exhibited), because he suddenly decided to paint her with her hair tied back. She chose to dress informally, in jeans and a stripy top, and Hockney asked her to find a pose that felt natural. Studio assistants fixed her position with charcoal markings around her foot and the chair legs. She found herself mesmerised by Hockney: \u201cYou can tell what bit of your anatomy he\u2019s working on \u2026 He\u2019s got an electric easel that he\u2019s able to move up and down, so he\u2019s working at optimum level. You know if he\u2019s on your face or your hands. It\u2019s fascinating to see the colour he\u2019s picking up \u2026 \u201cThere are moments when your thoughts slide elsewhere. Then you have existential thoughts. If I\u2019m not concentrating on me, will I look less like me? It does make you think about what you represent in a way that you never do if you\u2019re having a photograph taken.\u201d She was struck by his \u201cabsolute concentration to the exclusion of everything else\u201d with \u201cno conversation at all\u201d: \u201cHe\u2019s walking up and down. There\u2019s real fluidity of movement.\u201d There were short breaks \u2013 long enough for him to smoke a cigarette: \u201cHe\u2019ll sit down in an armchair that\u2019s positioned looking at the canvas \u2026 He gets photos sent to his iPad at the end of the day and looks at that all night. The next morning, he knows exactly what he wants to do.\u201d She described her likeness as quite thoughtful and relaxed, but with a certain seriousness: \u201cHe has got me.\u201d David Hockney RA: 82 Portraits and 1 Still Life will be at the Royal Academy from 2 July to 2 October. It is accompanied by a catalogue, for which Hockney was interviewed by Edith Devaney"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
