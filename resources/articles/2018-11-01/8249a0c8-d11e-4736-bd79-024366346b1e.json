Following Alyssa Healy\u2019s rapid start with the bat Australia will feel they left a few runs out in the middle and know bigger totals will be required to compete with the likes of India and New Zealand later in the group. The performance with the ball was impressive though. Meg Lanning has a balanced attack at her disposal, offering a variety of angles, pace and spin. They should be dangerous whatever the conditions. Healy\u2019s glovework deserves special mention. Her performance behind the stumps was outstanding and diverted attention away from an otherwise sloppy fielding performance. Next up for Australia should be another routine victory against Ireland while Pakistan face a must-win encounter against India, fresh off their opening victory against New Zealand. 20th over: Pakistan 113-8 (Mir 20, Nawaz 0) That\u2019s the final action of a routine victory for Australia. Schutt returns to wrap up proceedings and she is rewarded with one of the quirkier dismissals of her career. Nashra advances, misses, and the ball ricochets back off Healy\u2019s pads to effect a stumping. 19th over: Pakistan 111-7 (Mir 19, Nashra 13) Pakistan deserve credit for fighting until the end but there\u2019s an obvious lack of timing and power compared to Australia\u2019s deep batting order. There\u2019s no shortage of intent though, especially running between the wickets, keeping the dot balls to a minimum even while they struggle for boundaries. 18th over: Pakistan 105-7 (Mir 16, Nashra 11) Gardner has caught my eye today. She has found more drift, dip, spin and bounce than any other spinner. She finishes with figures of 1-23 from her four overs but with a touch more luck they could have been much more impressive. 17th over: Pakistan 97-7 (Mir 10, Nashra 9) Pakistan throwing the bat at everything now in a forlorn hope of reaching Australia\u2019s 165. Delissa Kimmince has proven difficult to get away all innings though, and that doesn\u2019t change in another over offering no width or length to score from. 16th over: Pakistan 92-7 (Mir 9, Nashra 6) Alyssa Healy is all over this contest. Following up her runs with the bat she has been in the game often with the gloves. This over she almost completes a brilliant stumping off the pace of Schutt - denied by DRS and the narrowest of margins - then she fails to react to a gloved reverse sweep that runs away for a rare boundary. 15th over: Pakistan 86-7 (Mir 5, Nashra 4) Another tidy Wareham over goes for six. It should be more but Gardner completes some super fielding on the long leg boundary. 14th over: Pakistan 80-7 (Mir 2, Nashra 1) Australia cruising to victory here in Guyana and it\u2019s been an impressive display of bowling from a nicely varied attack. Gardner finally has the wicket her bowling has deserved, and it\u2019s the big one of Maroof. Looking to force the issue with the run rate climbing, Maroof aims a lusty blow into the offside but can only sky a top edge straight to point. Second wicket of a terrific over and the second featuring the combination of Wareham and Healy. This time a routine legspinner is feathered by Aliya Riaz into the safe gloves of Healy standing up to the stumps. Outstanding display by both Australians. Some more superb glovework from the outstanding Healy. This time it\u2019s to snaffle a splendid dipping legspinner from Wareham that outfoxed the advancing Dar. Healy collected the ball and whipped off the zing bails in the blink of an eye, ending Dar\u2019s innings just as she was starting to attack. 12th over: Pakistan 71-4 (Maroof 21, Dar 4) Kimmince has another go, again hitting a full length at pace, limiting Pakistan\u2019s scoring opportunities. 11th over: Pakistan 69-4 (Maroof 20, Dar 3) That was excellent umpiring by Jacqueline Williams, by the way. In real time that looked like a botched stumping opportunity by Healy but Williams had detected the faintest of edges. Pakistan\u2019s rally comes to an end. Molineux is recalled and the first ball of her third over sees Javeria advance down the pitch and swipe a thin edge into the gloves of Healy. It wasn\u2019t a clean take but Australia\u2019s wicket-keeper held on to complete the dismissal. 10th over: Pakistan 64-3 (Maroof 18, Javeria 9) Gardner has found the most turn and bounce of any bowler so far today and it\u2019s on display again in another testing over. Her second ball in particular lands and grips, beating everything to run away for four byes. 9th over: Pakistan 57-3 (Maroof 17, Javeria 7) Good over for Pakistan, nine from it. They deal in singles to begin with but Maroof eventually gets hold of one of Kimmince\u2019s full skiddy deliveries and smacks it straight down the ground for four. 8th over: Pakistan 48-3 (Maroof 11, Javeria 5) Ashleigh Gardner continues Australia\u2019s spin-dominated approach and she proves difficult to get away. It\u2019s an impressive over of flight, drift and spin away from the left-handed Maroof, and that pressure almost results in a run out following some good work from Villani. 7th over: Pakistan 42-3 (Maroof 7, Javeria 4) Wareham into the attack and she concedes a boundary first up after the latest in a series of misfields from Australia. Whether it\u2019s the quality of the outfield, the lights, the dew, or none of the above, Australia\u2019s ground fielding has been uncharacteristically sloppy in these early overs. 6th over: Pakistan 33-3 (Maroof 1, Javeria 1 ) Australia well on top and heading for the convincing victory everyone expected before the start of play. Kimmince is rewarded for her fielding by being invited to bowl and she strikes almost immediately, holding on to a sharp return chance high to her right. Nahida tried to dig out a full delivery but seemed to be caught between going over the top and checking her drive. 5th over: Pakistan 27-2 (Nahida 5, Maroof 0) Schutt\u2019s not out of the attack for long, returning from the Commentary Box End to send down her unerringly accurate quick and full inswingers. Both batters do their best to show intent but Schutt is so difficult to get away they resort to stealing singles. After a couple of let-offs Australia eventually make them pay. Tragedy for Pakistan! Omaima was looking impressive but one tip and run too many eventually took its toll. Kimmince with the sharp work at point, Healy with flawless glovework. 4th over: Pakistan 24-1 (Nahida 4, Omaima 18) Molineux gets another over from the Pavilion End but she encounters Omaima in an attacking mindset. Pakistan\u2019s number three adds another boundary, this time over the covers, to keep her side in touch early in the run chase. 3rd over: Pakistan 16-1 (Nahida 2, Omaima 12) Schutt is off after just one over, making way for the pace of Elysse Perry, and Australia\u2019s premier allrounder is the first bowler to concede a boundary - well, sort of - it arrives via overthrows after a shocking shy at the stumps from skipper Lanning. A more conventional four arrives a few deliveries later. Short and wide from Perry and Omaima throws her hands at the ball, sending it skimming across the outfield just in front of point. 2nd over: Pakistan 4-1 (Nahida 1, Omaima 1) Sophie Molineux gets an early bowl and her left-arm spin keeps the pressure on Pakistan. 1st over: Pakistan 2-1 (Nahida 0) Megan Schutt, the number one ranked bowler in T20is, opens for Australia, and her pace, angling the ball in to Ayesha Zafar, restricts Pakistan to just two runs from the first five deliveries. That pressure tells with Ayesha out from the final ball of the over, missing an attempted slog sweep to a skiddy delivery with a hint of inswing. Perfect start for Australia. Pakistan\u2019s reply to Australia\u2019s 165 is about to get underway. Elsewhere in the World T20, favourites England will have to cope without the injured Katherine Brunt. Given Brunt\u2019s absence Sciver, the all-rounder who took 10 wickets in the KSL with her medium pace, is also likely to play an important role with the ball in a squad dominated by spinners. The loss of Brunt may open the way for either Gordon or Smith to make their debut, with the coach Mark Robinson hoping his surfeit of left-arm spinners \u2013 the 19-year-old Sophie Ecclestone makes up the trio \u2013 will make up for any failings in the fast-bowling department. An innings of two halves then for Australia as they post a solid 165. After Alyssa Healy\u2019s rapid start something above 200 looked on the cards but the introduction of Aliya Riaz\u2019s pace changed the momentum of the game. Once Aliya accounted for Healy boundaries proved hard to come by, helping Pakistan grow in confidence. 40s to Beth Mooney and Meg Lanning kept Australia moving but the late acceleration was interrupted by a flurry of wickets. 165 should still be enough on a pitch that lacks pace, especially considering Australia\u2019s attack and Pakistan\u2019s lack of quality with the bat. 20th over: Australia 165-5 (Haynes 1, Perry 2) Superb closing over from the pick of Pakistan\u2019s attack, Aliya Riaz. Two wickets during the over and only the one boundary conceded, that a final ball slog to the square-leg fence by Ellyse Perry. Australia making a mess of this final over. Villani follows Lanning back to the sheds after a communication breakdown with Haynes. Villani hit the ball straight to point and set off for a single but Haynes wasn\u2019t interested, sent her back, but took too long to make the call and a simple run out was completed. The third Australian falls in the 40s, Lanning this time chopping on an inswinging yorker from the excellent Aliya Riaz. 19th over: Australia 158-3 (Lanning 41, Villani 7) Elyse Villani doesn\u2019t require any sighters, she sashays down the pitch and creams Sana Mir through mid-off for a rasping four. After admiring that stroke from the non-striker\u2019s end Lanning ups the ante, stepping to leg and carving a majestic boundary over extra cover. That was a work of art. 18th over: Australia 145-3 (Lanning 35, Villani 0) Gardner\u2019s six-hitting power enters the World T20 - only just, mind you - the ball dropping just over the rope at midwicket following a long series of scampered one and twos. Gardner goes for the same spot again next ball but gets more bat on it, that extra wood sending the ball flat and hard straight to Dar, the boundary rider, and she has to go. 17th over: Australia 135-2 (Lanning 32, Gardner 6) Australia scampering through for runs from every delivery now with their complement of overs nearing an end. They can\u2019t find the rope though, Dar keeping the damage to just six from her final over, ending with figures of 0-31. 16th over: Australia 129-2 (Lanning 30, Gardner 2) Lanning and Gardner exchange singles before the former gets in an awful mess trying to work Anam from outside off behind square on the legside. She fails to connect with the slog sweep, Pakistan appeal and REVIEW an LBW shout. DRS is unimpressed though, the ball hitting Lanning outside the line of off stump and ball-tracker indicating it would not have gone on to hit the stumps anyway. Lanning responds with consecutive boundaries through the off-side. Both were all about timing and placement, the first behind square, the second in front. Australia\u2019s gun batter hitting her straps. 15th over: Australia 117-2 (Lanning 19, Gardner 1) Mooney\u2019s dismissal is the signal for Lanning to change gears, immediately taking charge and lofting an effortless six over extra-cover. What a shot! Ashleigh Gardner is off the mark with a single. Mooney did an excellent job for her country but like Healy she\u2019ll be disappointed not to have gone on to make a bigger score. That opening partnership has set the tone for the remainder of the tournament though and put the rest of Group B on notice. Mooney has ridden her luck with a few uppish drives but eventually that luck runs out. A slog-sweep to Nashra doesn\u2019t find the middle of the bat and Omaima Sohail takes a comfortable catch at long-on. 14th over: Australia 108-1 (Mooney 48, Lanning 11) Mooney enjoys opening her shoulders and carving the ball through the covers, and after a couple of dot-balls she does just that twice in a row to Anam Amin, collecting back-to-back boundaries. Lanning is not so fluent, she\u2019s taken 17 balls to creep to 11. 13th over: Australia 99-1 (Mooney 39, Lanning 11) Nashra Sandhu has another bowl and Australia are happy to deal in singles until Mooney pierces the offside ring to record the first boundary since the eighth over. 12th over: Australia 90-1 (Mooney 32, Lanning 9) Aliya Riaz\u2019s fast full and largely straight deliveries have been important for Pakistan in stemming Australia\u2019s flow and she sends down another over without conceding a boundary. Australia run hard though, turning a couple of ones into twos, to keep the scoreboard moving. 11th over: Australia 83-1 (Mooney 28, Lanning 5) Sana Mir keeps the pressure on, hitting a full length, varying her pace, keep both Australians honest. Lanning is patiently working her way into her innings. Mooney is trying to force the issue but is struggling for consistent timing. Australia restricted to 25/1 from the past five overs after Healy\u2019s explosive start. 10th over: Australia 80-1 (Mooney 26, Lanning 5) Aliya Riaz continues her excellent spell, bowling full and straight and forcing both Australian batters to check their drives. Two consecutive boundaryless overs. 9th over: Australia 77-1 (Mooney 25, Lanning 3) Nida Dar is unfortunate not to have collected a wicket today. She beats Mooney\u2019s slog sweep this over, then watches a lofted drive land between long-on and long-off, but she avoids conceding a boundary in a tidy over. Meg Lanning is off the mark with a cute dabbed three behind square on the off side. 8th over: Australia 72-1 (Mooney 23) Aliya Riaz is invited to bowl the first over of pace and immediately she looks more dangerous than her slow-bowling colleagues. Healy is fortunate to survive two mishit cover drives, both lofted in the direction of cover but both somehow avoiding going to hand. As is her wont, Healy brushes off those errors with the presence of mind to alter her hitting zone, guiding Aliya down to third for a boundary. And then she\u2019s out! Final delivery of the over, Healy goes downtown, but she sends straight down Nahida\u2019s throat at long-on. The end of a powerful and enterprising innings from Australia\u2019s opener, setting up her side perfectly. 7th over: Australia 64-0 (Healy 41, Mooney 22) Another let off for Mooney! Nida Dar is back and the first delivery of her second over finds Mooney\u2019s leading edge but the ball loops agonisingly over the bowler and just out of reach of the incoming cover fielder. Mooney responds by dropping to one knee and slog-sweeping through midwicket for four. 6th over: Australia 58-0 (Healy 40, Mooney 17) Nashra Sandhu is the fourth Pakistan player to be thrown the ball but her first delivery is eased sumptuously through extra-cover by Mooney. Her left-arm darts then force Mooney and Healy to check their shots before the latter opens her shoulders, smacking first over mid-on, then mid-off, to send the scoreboard rocketing along. Australia re going to rack up a massive total. 5th over: Australia 43-0 (Healy 32, Mooney 10) Anam Amin is back for her second over of left-arm finger spin and she delivers the first over of the match without a boundary, thanks largely to variety of angles denying either Australian the opportunity to line her up. 4th over: Australia 40-0 (Healy 32, Mooney 7) More poor fielding from Pakistan, this time Nida Dar dropping a sitter in the covers to hand Beth Mooney a life after some lovely bowling from Mir. Both Australians shaped up aggressively to the experienced Pakistani but her control of pace and length gave them nothing to hit cleanly and should have earned her a wicket. 3rd over: Australia 33-0 (Healy 31, Mooney 1) Healy is on a mission. Another new bowler and another array of boundaries all around the Providence Stadium. A misfield gifts a four through mid-off, a powerful drive through cover earns one more, and then a delightful late glance engineers a third for the over through the vacant slip cordon. Nida Dar will have some thinking to do before her second effort. 2nd over: Australia 19-0 (Healy 17, Mooney 1) The experienced Sana Mir shares the new ball for Pakistan but Healy is once again on top early, working her second ball nonchalantly through the legside for a boundary then dancing down the pitch and lofting another four over extra-cover. Mir\u2019s off-spinners from over the wicket not doing much off this Guyana surface. 1st over: Australia 10-0 (Healy 8, Mooney 1) Bosh! Australia up and running with intent. Alyssa Healy only required a couple of sighters to take Anam downtown, lofting ball number five into the sightscreen. Around that it was tidy stuff from the left-arm orthodox, aiming for the toes of the right-handed Healy from around the wicket and floating the up outside off against the left-handed Mooney. Here we go, Anam Amin with the ball for Pakistan, Alyssa Healy on strike for Australia. The two sides are making their way out for the anthems, Australia in their familiar all-gold uniform, Pakistan top to toe in green. Australia\u2019s women will be out to emulate their men\u2019s team who completed an ODI victory over South Africa a few hours ago in Adelaide. Quite the act for Australia to follow. This is match number two at this WT20. In the opener, India stunned a heavily fancied New Zealand to throw the cat among the pigeons in Group B. Once again the star of the show was Harmanpreet Kaur, the Indian skipper hammering 103 from just 51 deliveries. 1. Nahida Khan, 2. Ayesha Zafar, 3. Umaima Sohail, 4. Bismah Maroof, 5. Javeria Khan (capt), 6. Nida Dar, 7. Aliya Riaz, 8. Sana Mir, 9. Nashra Sandhu, 10. Sidra Nawaz (wk), 11. Anam Amin. Pakistan opting for four spinners and just the one quick on a slow surface they expect to take some turn. Australia go in as expected with Sophie Molineux retaining her place ahead of Jess Jonassen. It won\u2019t be long until our first look at Australia\u2019s impressive batting line-up with Meg Lanning winning the toss and deciding to post a score. Lisa Sthalekar believes Australia will be motivated to right the wrongs of 2016 and are hitting form just at the right time. Everything is aligning nicely for the Australians, at the right time too. History is on their side, they are heading to a place where they have enjoyed success before and most importantly, they might have cracked the formula for World Cup success. The trophy cabinet may not stay empty for much longer. If you need to get up to speed on all the sides in the West Indies ahead of this WT20, never fear, Adam Collins has your back. Providence Stadium, you say? Not yet seven o\u2019clock on the eastern seaboard? Around 29 minutes to the first ball of the day? Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of the second match in the Women\u2019s World T20, this one featuring perennial favourites Australia against Pakistan. The first ball at Guyana\u2019s Providence Stadium will be bowled at 4pm local time (8pm GMT / 7am AEDT). After conceding possession of the WT20 trophy in 2016 for the first time since 2010 Australia will be out to make amends in the West Indies. They enter the tournament sitting on top of the ICC standings and with an imposing squad featuring three batters and two bowlers in the top ten of the individual rankings for each craft. Coach Matthew Mott described the motivation in the Australian camp as one of \u201ctaking care of unfinished business\u201d in reference to Hayley Matthews\u2019 incredible knock that saw the West Indies triumph in the 2016 final. For Pakistan the mission is to progress beyond the group phase for the first time in a World T20 but they face an uphill task in a pool featuring not only Australia but India and New Zealand. Ranked seventh in the world by the ICC, remaining competitive will be no mean feat. These sides met recently in Kuala Lumpur with Australia dominating the three-match ODI series and claiming each of the three T20s with plenty to spare. In those three matches Pakistan could only muster a top score of 131, and finding enough runs to put pressure on Australia\u2019s formidable batting order looks to be their biggest challenge today. Feel free to join in the conversation as the game progresses.
