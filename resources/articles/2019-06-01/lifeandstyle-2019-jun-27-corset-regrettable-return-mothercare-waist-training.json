Last week, Mothercare was accused of pandering to the pressure on new mothers to lose their pregnancy weight and remain \u201csexy\u201d by selling a corset, modelled by a woman wearing patent leather platform stilettos. \u201cI\u2019m very anxious for women who are getting the wrong message,\u201d Jacqui Tomkins, the chair of Independent Midwives UK, told the Times. \u201cIt\u2019s saying the most important thing is for you to be back in shape, looking like Kim Kardashian. That worries me.\u201d The company has since removed the product and image, but is still selling a lace-print band, described as a \u201ctummy tucker\u201d, to be worn around the stomach, which it claims \u201chelps with slimming down\u201d. Despite this furore, the corset has been creeping back into fashion for some time. In 2016, Prada revived the garment in a more utilitarian style, worn loosely laced over thick tailoring and sweaters. This style, while still designed to bring attention to a trim waist, was not rooted in old ideas of \u201csexiness\u201d. But for autumn/winter 2019, fashion designers showed a more traditional style, with a return to full corsets and wide, waist-cinching belts. And on social media, this traditional silhouette has an even tighter grip. There are more than a million posts on Instagram with a \u201cwaist training\u201d tag. Many are niche corset-enthusiasts \u2013 a culture that could come under the categories of retro style, body modification, fetishism or cosplay \u2013 but the trend for an exaggerated hourglass figure has also turned waist training mainstream. Katie Thomas, a corset designer who set up her company in 1999, says corset culture and waist trainers are completely different markets. She remembers the garments that were supposed to aid weight loss in the 80s and 90s. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that 30 years on, women are looking for quick weight loss, and that\u2019s what the waist trainer market is trying to capitalise on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is selling women false hope.\u201d Corsets, she says, are \u201cdifferent because we\u2019re not focused on losing weight, it\u2019s just about emphasising your body shape and celebrating the curves you have. I wear a corset every day because I like the shape it gives me. We have a lot of transgender clients who want a more feminine figure.\u201d The look got a huge boost when Kardashian wore a corseted Thierry Mugler dress to the Met Ball in May. The dress, designed to look like wet skin, contained a corset made by the corsetier Mr Pearl, who has long made corsets for Mugler, as well as other designers including Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood (he also wears a corset and has a reported 18-inch waist himself). Thomas has noticed a recent flurry of interest since Kardashian\u2019s corseted dress, but she thinks the more traditional corset is \u201calways going to be a niche item\u201d with, she says, a close-knit and friendly community. The fad for waist trainers, however, has been growing more for the past few years. Kardashian, whose body shape has probably had the biggest impact on the extreme hourglass \u201cideal\u201d, has long been a promoter of waist-trainer bands on her Instagram account, as have her sisters Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. These bands are essentially wide, elasticated belts that cinch you in and claim to lead to a permanently slimmer middle. \u201cKim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner said it was their secret to an hourglass shape,\u201d says Chloe Lawrence, a beauty blogger who started waist training a year ago. She started wearing a tight-fitting band around her midriff for an hour a day, working up to eight hours. \u201cIt was very uncomfortable and caused me a lot of pain,\u201d she says. \u201c[I had] shortness of breath and pain in my stomach when the trainer was off.\u201d She says she didn\u2019t notice any real change in her shape. \u201cIt works while you are wearing it, but as soon as you take it off, your waist just goes back to normal. I sometimes wear it under a dress as a corset for that specific time. But for long-term, this does not work.\u201d Few items of clothing come with as much baggage as the corset. The modern view is that they are little more than an instrument of torture, invented to oppress women. The truth may be more nuanced. Corset-type garments \u2013 known as stays \u2013 took off in the 16th century, and were mainly designed to create an upright posture. In the 1800s, however, they became an essential part of women\u2019s fashion, and also tighter and more constrictive. But in her 2001 book The Corset: A Cultural History, the fashion historian Valerie Steele says the detrimental health effects \u2013 they were blamed for organ failure and spinal deformity \u2013 of wearing a corset were exaggerated, and that only a minority of women \u201ctight-laced\u201d to create an unnaturally tiny waist. They would have made life more difficult for many women, though, constricting the ability to move or sit comfortably, and even hindering basic functions such as eating and breathing. In May this year, the actor Elle Fanning fainted at the Cannes film festival and later blamed it on her Prada 50s-style dress, nipped in at the waist, being too tight. Kardashian had to travel to the Met Gala standing up in a vehicle, holding on to a pole, and said she wouldn\u2019t be able to go to the bathroom. But Thomas says she doesn\u2019t find her corsets restrictive. Although 19th-century women\u2019s rights campaigners set their sights on dress reform, and Coco Chanel helped liberate women from the corset, Steele argues it never really went away. \u201cThe corset did not so much disappear as become internalised through diet, exercise and plastic surgery,\u201d she writes. Corsets gave way to girdles; girdles gave way to shapewear such as Spanx, launched in 2000; and now waist trainers have taken off. Waist trainers and more traditional corsets are widespread on social media because they are a perfect fit. \u201cWe know that women\u2019s bodies are the subject of scrutiny and control,\u201d says Rebecca Scritchfield, a dietitian, exercise physiologist and author of the book Body Kindness. Social media reward anything \u201cthat is unusual or unique. The thin ideal is so rare and impossible to achieve, and this is another level of that. The picture on Instagram of somebody with a tiny waist and giant boobs is exotic, almost a fantasy. You get rewarded for participating in this uniqueness or rarity.\u201d Likewise, she says, \u201cSome people might be grossed out\u201d by the artificiality of the look, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t matter because it still drums up a reaction.\u201d The company Waist Train UK has more than 14,000 followers on Instagram and claims its products can \u201ccurb appetites as the body adjusts to eating smaller portions during meals\u201d. Some, such as the Kardashian-approved US brand Waist Gang Society, have hundreds of thousands of followers. Yet the idea that you can simply squeeze your waist into submission, says Scritchfield, is a myth. There may also be dangers to waist trainers. Wearing one all day could lead to skin problems, if it rubs or causes sweating. Some waist trainers claim to raise the body\u2019s temperature to encourage weight loss during workouts. \u201cWhere it raises your body temperature, if you\u2019re not drinking water, you could get dehydrated,\u201d she says, adding it could even lead to heatstroke. \u201cThey can constrict your breathing, which isn\u2019t helpful. They can make your organs feel constricted. Besides the physical discomfort and pain it can cause, I think that there is emotional pain when you don\u2019t get the result you expected.\u201d For postpartum women, the corset seems to be a new low. The fashion commentator Caryn Franklin says it sets \u201cunreasonable expectations. It is also normalising the idea that somehow the body getting back to its pre-pregnant state is a more focused achievement than the achievement of pregnancy and childbirth.\u201d The return of the focus on the waist is, she says, \u201cthe last place left to exploit. The waist has pretty much been left alone, while there has been huge focus on faces, lips, hair, breasts and latterly, thighs and buttocks.\u201d She is less concerned with the corset\u2019s appearance on the catwalk because she has seen it resurface several times in the nearly 40 years she has been working in fashion. \u201cA plus about fashion is you put something on for fun to present yourself in a certain way and make a statement, and then you take it off,\u201d she says. The trend for waist training, she says, feels different \u2013 it requires a desire to change your body. That the Kardashians are the prime drivers, she adds, \u201cdoesn\u2019t sit well with me. The Kardashian industry is built on the performance of femininity, where they present as hyperfeminised and hypersexualised. It\u2019s all about appearance, and the normalisation of cosmetic surgery within that family means that they\u2019re presenting an idea of femininity and making money out of the unachievable bodies they have crafted for themselves.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
