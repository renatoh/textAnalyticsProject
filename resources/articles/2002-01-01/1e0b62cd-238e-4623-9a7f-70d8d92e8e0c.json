Four days after seeing the proposed purchase of John Carew fall through, Fulham's need for a new striker was heightened when Hayles was charged with misconduct relating to alleged violent behaviour in an incident with Everton's defender David Weir. The 29-year-old can expect a suspension and fine if he is found guilty. Fulham are likely to be fined up to \u00a3250,000 if they are found guilty of failing to control their players in the confrontation, which involved almost all 22 players at Craven Cottage on December 8. It would be a surprise if Everton do not face a similar charge for their part in the brawl during a 2-0 defeat. Fulham's Luis Boa Morte and Weir were sent off, although Boa Morte's red card for allegedly biting Weir was rescinded. The FA has given the Cottagers a fortnight to respond. A statement issued by Fulham last night said: \"The club is obviously disappointed by this decision and intends to mount a vigorous defence against these charges. \"Fulham FC also acknowledge a charge has been issued to Barry Hayles regarding an alleged altercation between David Weir and himself at the same game. An answer to this charge will also be defended and submitted to the FA.\" The FA is also believed to be looking into Thierry Henry's outburst at the referee Graham Poll after Arsenal's 3-1 home defeat by Newcastle last month. It is expected that the French striker will face a misconduct charge that could lead to a fine and a ban. Chelsea's defender Graeme le Saux has had a yellow card for diving against Southampton overturned after the referee reviewed the incident on video. \"Eddie Wolstenholme has decided that the caution should not be recorded against Graeme le Saux,\" said the Football Association spokesman Adrian Bevington. Arsenal are optimistic that they can begin work on their \u00a3250m stadium soon after the start of next season and that the ground will be ready for the 2004-05 campaign. The only obstacle, following the London mayor Ken Livingstone's approval, is the remote possibility of the transport secretary Stephen Byers calling for a public inquiry, though it is expected that he will rubber-stamp the plans before the end of the month. \"We hope to start the building work just after the end of the summer,\" an Arsenal spokesman said. \"But the first part of it entails the removal of a waste plant currently on the site at Ashburton Grove.\" On the pitch, however, Arsenal suffered a setback when their captain Tony Adams limped off after 20 minutes of their 3-2 defeat in a reserve game with Coventry that also featured appearances from Francis Jeffers, who scored a fine goal, and the goalkeeper Richard Wright. The former England defender, now 35, is expected to be sidelined for at least two weeks. Arsenal's left-back Ashley Cole, as well as the midfielders Ray Parlour and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, are suspended for Sunday's visit of Liverpool, which will be Kanu's last before he joins up with Nigeria for the African Nations Cup finals, a tournament that could keep him away from Highbury for up to four weeks. Lauren is also wanted by Cameroon but is having treatment for an ankle injury. o You've read the piece, now have your say.
