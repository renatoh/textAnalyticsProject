In an interview with the ABC shortly after being released from immigration detention, Palfreeman said he feared the influence of far-right political movements, which are seeking to have him reimprisoned, on the judiciary and criminal justice system. Palfreeman served 11 years of a 20-year sentence for the 2007 murder of a student, before being paroled last month. Palfreeman has consistently maintained he acted in self-defence, a version of events supported by a recently released video showing him coming to the aid of two men being assaulted by a group of more than a dozen other men. While he was paroled last month, and this week released from immigration detention, Palfreeman has had his passport seized and cannot leave Bulgaria. He fears a political push to have his case \u201creopened\u201d could see him reimprisoned far beyond his original sentence. The nationalist VMRO party, a junior government coalition party which has protested his parole, nominated deputy minister of justice Nikolay Prodanov to his position. \u201cThe fear of going back to prison is connected with the fact this fascist party still controls the prisons,\u201d Palfreeman told the ABC. \u201cFor sure they would set me up, they would put drugs in my room, they would get a false witness against me, they would set me up to try to get me another sentence and to put me back into maximum security prison.\u201d Palfreeman said the rule of law in Bulgaria was being sacrificed for political expediency in his case, with politicians seeking to sate populist movements in the country. \u201cThe laws are clear that they shouldn\u2019t send my case back to be reopened, but the laws are also clear that when you\u2019re being attacked by 13 men that you\u2019re allowed to defend yourself, and I got 20 years anyway,\u201d Palfreeman said. While concerned about endemic corruption in the criminal justice system, Palfreeman praised the Bulgarian people for standing up to authoritarian forces in the country. \u201cWhat I would like people in Australia to understand [is] that there are many brave Bulgarians who have been trying to fight against the corruption, against the mafia, the powers that be, that are corrupting the justice system,\u201d he said. Palfreeman has said if he is freed, he would like to stay in Bulgaria to continue his work with the Bulgarian Prisoners\u2019 Association he helped establish, campaigning for inmates\u2019 rights in the country. However, if he is granted his liberty it appears certain Palfreeman will be deported from the country. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister Marise Payne has consistently raised concerns that \u201cnon-legal considerations\u201d were influencing Bulgaria\u2019s highly irregular treatment of Palfreeman\u2019s case since he was paroled. Payne has made repeated entreaties to her Bulgarian counterpart Ekaterina Zakharieva, insisting the Bulgarian government afford Palfreeman \u201cdue process, consistent with Bulgarian law\u201d. Palfreeman, from Sydney, was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years for fatally stabbing a 23-year-old law student, Andrei Monov, in Sofia during a night out in December 2007. He was also convicted of attempted murder of Monov\u2019s associate Antoan Zahariev, who was injured. The Australian has consistently maintained he acted in self-defence in the early hours of 28 December 2007, after intervening to prevent Monov and a group of more than a dozen friends from attacking two Roma men in the city centre. His lawyer, Kalin Angelov, has released security camera footage of the brawl, which Palfreeman said exonerated him and demonstrated clearly his stabbing of Monov occurred after the group turned on him. Then 21, Palfreeman pleaded not guilty to murdering Monov (he was carrying a large butterfly knife belonging to a friend with which he stabbed the student in the side of his chest) but was found guilty of murder. The conviction and sentence were upheld by higher courts. Palfreeman said he had been carrying the knife because he\u2019d previously experienced violence in Sofia. While his unexpected parole in September was greeted with elation by his family and supporters in Australia, it was condemned by senior politicians in Bulgaria, including the dead man\u2019s father, and has divided the country\u2019s legal fraternity. Monov\u2019s father, Hristo, a former MP for the Bulgarian Socialist party, said the court had made a mockery of Bulgaria\u2019s people. \u201cThe three judges \u2026 will carry a moral disgrace on their own,\u201d he said. Ultra-nationalist political parties marched on Sofia\u2019s Palace of Justice demanding Palfreeman be reimprisoned, and the country\u2019s prosecutor general launched a highly irregular appeal to the supreme court of cassation, the highest court in the land, for his parole to be overturned. A decision by that court \u2013 likely to ultimately decide Palfreeman\u2019s freedom \u2013 is expected within two months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
