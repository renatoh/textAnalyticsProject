Against Slovenia, he's tried to keep Gerrard and Lampard out of each other's way, but there's a double cost: pushing Gerrard out wide where he's wasted, while Barry, not Lampard, takes on Gerrard's role as the key creative player in the centre \u2013 not Barry's best role, which is the holding player. This happens because Lampard doesn't relish the role of central creator \u2013 he likes to be free to arrive in the box at the right moment to score. Only if Capello leaves out Lampard can Gerrard and Barry play their best roles for England. Releasing Lampard's place also means many more wide options, where England have enviable talent to attack the Germans. It's Capello's Jimmy Greaves moment \u2013 this is when we find out whether he really can face up to tough decisions and create the optimal team on the pitch, not simply juggle with the most celebrated names.
