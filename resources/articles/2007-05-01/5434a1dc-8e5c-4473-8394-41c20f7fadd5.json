The 32-year-old Saracens and France back ended speculation about his future at the Watford-based club by confirming he would not be asking for a further contract. \"I knew at the start of the year that this would be my last season,\" said Castaign\u00e8de, who had been a Saracen for seven seasons. \"My years in England have allowed me to experience a different style of rugby, a new culture and some fine people.\" He said he would continue training in the hope that he can gain selection with France for their tour of New Zealand this June - the touring party will be announced this week - while he also has his sights on the World Cup this autumn. If selected for the World Cup, he will retire from the international game at the end of the tournament to concentrate on a career in banking. He will remain based in north London. \"I hope I will go to the World Cup and then I will stop afterwards,\" he said. \"But there are no certainties for anyone, there are several stages to get there. However, I will keep training flat out, mentally and physically I want to be ready. In my head am going, as long as the selectors haven't seen my last match for Saracens.\" Castaign\u00e8de's Saracens' season came to an abrupt end last Saturday when his team were thumped by Gloucester in the semi-final of the Premiership play-offs, so ending the club's hopes of their first trophy for nine years. The World Cup, held on French soil this autumn, is at the heart of his decision to retire. \"Whatever happens it will be hard to pick myself up and do more of the same after that. If I do get there, everything will be an anticlimax afterwards and, if I don't, it will be just as tough,\" he added. Castaign\u00e8de began his club career at Mont de Marsan, in the south-west of France, moving to Toulouse where he was part of four French title-winning sides between 1994 and 1997. He subsequently moved to Castres, before making his Saracens debut on August 20, 2000. He scored 131 points in his first seven games but suffered an Achilles tendon tear while warming up before France's Test against Australia on November 4 that year. The injury took 18 months and two grafts before it healed and it was November 2002 before Castaign\u00e8de again pulled on a France shirt. Although not selected for the 2003 World Cup, he returned to favour to play an integral attacking role in France's 2006 Six Nations title."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
