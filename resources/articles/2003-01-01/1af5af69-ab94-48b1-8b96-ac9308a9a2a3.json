The mosque was raided at 2am this morning in an operation linked to the discovery of traces of the poison ricin in a north London flat. Police also discovered large numbers of passports, identity cards and credit cards. Seven people were arrested following the \"pre-planned and intelligence-led\" raid, which involved the mosque and two three-storey properties nearby. Egyptian-born Abu Hamza, a radical cleric based at the mosque who was not one of those arrested, denied any link between the mosque and the discovery of ricin earlier this month in a flat in Wood Green. He today accused the prime minister, Tony Blair, and the police of \"Rambo\" tactics and said he believed the anti-terrorism operation was in retaliation for the murder of Detective Constable Stephen Oake in Manchester last week. \"I was anticipating the raid. It serves a multiple purpose. It serves Mr Blair and the police. I see this as a retaliation for what happened in Manchester. This is the heartland of Algerian people in London. It is Blair giving out a message to America,\" he said. \"It is disgusting. The police have never been denied access to the mosque. I don't know what they have taken. They may have taken computers.\" He claimed if any dangerous substances were found in the mosque they would have had to have been planted by the police. The seven people who were arrested were detained under the Terrorism Act 2000 and taken to a central London police station for questioning, Scotland Yard said. Six of the men are north Africans aged between 23 and 48 years old. The seventh man is from eastern Europe and is 22 years old. A Metropolitan police spokesman said: \"[We are] aware of the sensitivity of such an operation but evidence gathered during recent counter-terrorist investigations in London and elsewhere has uncovered links between the premises and suspected terrorist activity. Such evidence has made this operation absolutely necessary at this time.\" Police wanted to make clear that the raid was not against the mosque itself or those who went there to pray, but that it had targeted specific terrorist suspects, the spokesman stressed. He continued: \"The operation is part of ongoing and extensive inquiries by the Metropolitan police's anti-terrorist branch into alleged terrorist activity in London and elsewhere in the UK. \"Although this operation is linked to arrests made in north and east London on January 5, at this stage there is nothing to suggest that chemical substances are on the premises and there is no suggestion at this stage that there is any risk to the public.\" Police had not entered those parts of the mosque used for prayer, taking \"every step possible to show respect for the Muslim faith\", he said. The home secretary, David Blunkett, said the operation had his \"complete support\", adding: \"As I made clear yesterday, and repeatedly in recent weeks, we must take firm action to investigate, and if necessary deal with, any potential threat to public safety without fear or favour.\" A quarter-mile area around the four-storey mosque, which was being searched by special branch officers, was cordoned off to traffic and any residents returning to their homes were being escorted by police. Local residents said the operation included helicopters with searchlights, dozens of police motorcycles and up to 50 riot police in riot gear. Some of the building's windows looked open or broken this morning, and the curtains were billowing through them. All roads were reopened except St Thomas's road, where the mosque stands. Local resident Ann Heyno, 60, a local councillor, said: \"It's very, very frightening if you think about it ... this mosque has been the centre of quite a lot of local interest and concern. People thought it was only a matter of time before something happened here but I was shocked to hear about what has happened this morning.\" Dr Mohammed Sekkoum, of the Algerian refugee council, said he used to worship at the mosque but stopped two years ago. \"I stopped coming because I didn't agree with Abu Hamza's methods,\" he said. \"I don't agree with all the hatred and war. I came here as a persecuted man, not to be a persecutor,\" he said. The operation was not linked to efforts by the charity commission to expel Mr Hamza as an agent of the mosque because of his \"inflammatory and highly political\" speeches at prayer meetings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
