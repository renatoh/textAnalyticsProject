Speaking in Westminster, Corbyn will shrug off his party\u2019s double-digit deficit in the polls and insist Labour is poised to form the next government. \u201cMuch of the media and establishment are saying this election is a foregone conclusion,\u201d he will say. \u201cThey think there are rules in politics, which if you don\u2019t follow by doffing your cap to powerful people, accepting that things can\u2019t really change, then you can\u2019t win. \u201cThey say I don\u2019t play by the rules \u2013 their rules. We can\u2019t win, they say, because we don\u2019t play their game. They\u2019re quite right I don\u2019t. And a Labour government elected on 8 June won\u2019t play by their rules.\u201d He will say that fatcat bosses and corporations should be afraid of a Labour victory. \u201cIf I were Southern Rail or Philip Green [chairman of Arcadia Group], I\u2019d be worried about a Labour government.\u201d \u201cIf I were Mike Ashley [chairman of Sports Direct] or the CEO of a tax-avoiding multinational corporation, I\u2019d want to see a Tory victory. Labour is the party that will put the interests of the majority first.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s team hope to channel some of the gutsy style of his two Labour leadership battles into the general election campaign. They will also take inspiration from Bernie Sanders\u2019 bid to win the Democratic nomination for the US presidency. He will tell his audience in Westminster: \u201cWhen we win, it\u2019s the people \u2013 not the powerful \u2013 who win. The nurse, the teacher, the small trader, the carer, the builder, the office worker win. We all win.\u201d The Labour leader made a symbolic visit to Croydon Central, the seat of housing minister Gavin Barwell, on Wednesday, to underline his ambition to \u201cprove the establishment experts wrong,\u201d and snatch seats from the Conservatives. Labour hopes to steer the debate to the state of the economy, living standards, schools and the NHS \u2013 while prime minister Theresa May has repeatedly presented it as a test of her leadership against Corbyn\u2019s. May flew to Bolton North East on Wednesday night by helicopter, to speak to an audience of activists. Downing Street said she plans to meet as many voters as she can once the campaign kicks off, rather than sticking to the carefully stage-managed events that characterised the failed remain campaign in last year\u2019s EU referendum. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all about meeting people, knocking on doors, having those personal conversations,\u201d said a No 10 source, adding that the campaign would have \u201cits own unique feel\u201d. Labour categorically ruled out entering a coalition with the Scottish National party on Wednesday, after SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was willing to consider a \u201cprogressive alliance\u201d to take on the Tories. Former Labour leader Ed Miliband was relentlessly pilloried by the Conservatives as the puppet of the SNP during the 2015 election campaign, and Corbyn is keen to avoid constant speculation about the makeup of potential coalitions. Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, Corbyn said, \u201cThere will be no coalition deal with the SNP and a Labour government.\u201d He added that he did not consider Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s party to be progressive, because it had passed on Tory spending cuts in Scotland. \u201cThe SNP may talk left at Westminster, but in government in Scotland it acts right,\u201d he said. May has already begun using the idea of a coalition as an attack line. She used her speech in Bolton \u2013 a seat Labour holds with a majority of more than 4,000 \u2013 to warn against what she called a \u201ccoalition of chaos\u201d, with the SNP joining forces with Labour and the Liberal Democrats. While Corbyn kicks off his campaign in London, Labour will be scrambling to hold emergency selections for hundreds of constituencies across Britain, with allies of the leader eyeing up key seats vacated by retiring MPs. About 10 Labour MPs are planning to stand down, creating a battle over their winnable seats between those loyal and opposed to the leadership. Those vacating their seats include Tom Blenkinsop for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, Andy Burnham in Leigh, Pat Glass in North West Durham, Alan Johnson in West Hull, Andrew Smith in Oxford East, Gisela Stuart in Birmingham Edgbaston and Iain Wright in Hartlepool. The makeup of the parliamentary party after 8 June will be hugely significant as any potential leftwing candidate to succeed Corbyn in future will need 15% of support of MPs and MEPs. If enough leftwingers make it into parliament, allies of Corbyn may no longer need to pass a proposed rule change, dubbed the McDonnell amendment, at conference which would reduce the threshold to 5% and guarantee the chance of a left-leaning successor candidate on a future leadership ballot. It has emerged that Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC) will take control of the selection process along with regional boards, as the short timeframe for the election means allowing party members a say as usual is impractical. Under emergency measures, all Labour MPs in England who wish to carry on will be readopted and unsuccessful candidates from the 2015 election will be asked to seek selection again. One party source said a third of MPs and former candidates had agreed, a third were considering it and a third had refused. The Scottish and Welsh Labour parties will run their own selection procedures. Candidates for other vacancies will be chosen by the party\u2019s ruling bodies on the national executive and regional boards to make sure there are enough people to contest every seat by the first week of May."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
