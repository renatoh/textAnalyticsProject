Before the coronavirus pandemic struck, Woodward was one of 20 chaplains and volunteers from maritime welfare groups who boarded ships at this port to offer help to the 500,000 seafarers who pass through here every year. Now, he is the only one left. As he travels from ship to ship, he now dons disposable gloves, keeps two metres from the crew and stops at the top of the gangway, rather than enter vessels. But he doesn\u2019t wear a face mask: he feels it is important to show his face. \u201cThey are anxious and lonely,\u201d Woodward, a chaplain for the Mission to Seafarers, told the Guardian. \u201cOne seafarer almost cried when I told him I was the last chaplain still visiting ships in the port. He was a seafarer from the Philippines and, like myself, had two small children. He was misty-eyed. He was checking in daily with his family, but coronavirus is also in the Philippines and they are thousands of miles away.\u201d The port is vital to the global supply chain of food, medicine and other goods, and many of the seafarers who work the container ships have not been ashore in months \u2013 and may not be able to land for some time yet. \u201cThey are tough guys and they tend not to show it, but you can see it in their eyes,\u201d says Woodward. \u201cThey are anxious. Their families are often thousands of miles away, in countries that are in lockdown. At this time, what they can\u2019t offer their families is protection. That is what they are worried about. We are all human and this is a big unknown.\u201d Anxiety is growing among crews. Some have reported non-payment of wages, or contracts being extended without consent. Other seafarers have been stranded in foreign ports without wages or flights home. Shipping organisations and seafarers unions are urging governments to make travel easier for ships\u2019 crews, amid reports of thousands of seamen becoming stranded on their vessels after their contracts have ended, due to coronavirus restrictions and a lack of international flights. In normal circumstances, Woodward, a dual British-Dutch national who was ordained in Cambridge and lives with his wife and two children in Schiedam, in the Netherlands, would offer seafarers a trip ashore to the supermarket to get supplies, a much-needed sim card to stay in touch with family, or pastoral support. \u201cNow, I try to have a brief conversation \u2013 about how grateful we are for their work keeping global supply chains open. I say, I\u2019m here to say thank you and unfortunately, then I will have to leave you. I\u2019m unable to have the in-depth pastoral conversations we usually have,\u201d he says. In recent weeks, Woodward has visited seafarers from the Philippines, India, Russia, the Ukraine and Romania. \u201cMost people don\u2019t realise it but these seafarers are essential workers,\u201d he says. \u201cOur heroes are the nurses and doctors, in the NHS and elsewhere \u2013 but without seafarers, how would the supermarkets work? We know that medical supplies and groceries are coming out of the port. If all that stopped \u2026 it is unimaginable.\u201d This week the UK became the first country to recognise seafarers as \u201ckey workers\u201d , following pressure from the international chamber of shipping, the UK chamber of shipping, transport unions and maritime charities. Earlier this month, Woodward received a WhatsApp message from a seaman from Mindanao, in the Philippines, who was desperate to see his wife and daughter, now in lockdown. The man\u2019s contract, on a vessel sailing in the Mediterranean, had ended in December and was extended for a month \u2013 but after Covid-19 struck, requests from the ship to countries including Turkey and Israel to allow it to dock were turned down. He has now been at sea for a year. \u201cThis has become a real issue, with many seafarers finding themselves trapped onboard their vessel, not allowed to disembark by their companies, the port state or the flag state,\u201d Woodward says. \u201cThis needs urgent intervention and a sustainable solution, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Woodward will continue his work as long as it\u2019s safe, he says. On Monday he visited five ships and distributed bags to the men, containing woolly hats, bibles and hand-written cards from children thanking the seafarers for their work. These gifts have touched many, he said, including a Filipino father of two he met last week. \u201cHe was blown away,\u201d Woodward recalls. \u201cHe just said, \u2018Wow\u2019. A simple thank you from a child.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
