If, as appears likely, Joe Biden wins, he will become the first president since George HW Bush to enter office without control of both the House and Senate \u2013 an outcome that indicates at least two years of legislative gridlock. It\u2019s a scenario Wall Street appears to love. One that may give Republicans in the Senate little incentive to enact a new, larger coronavirus stimulus package that Democrats have hoped for and the power to block tax increases, big spending programs and tougher regulations. Stocks jumped again on Thursday, the first time since 1982 that the Dow and S&amp;P 500 rose at least 1% on four straight sessions, giving the stock indices their biggest weekly gains since April, with the Dow up 7.1% week, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq up 7.4% and 9% in the week to date. Oliver Jones, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, told the Guardian: \u201cThere\u2019s definitely some relief that things like tougher tax policy, tougher corporate reforms look to be off the table without Democrats having more control over Congress. \u201cEssentially, it\u2019s going to look more like a continuation of the status quo, which is the outcome favoured by most firms,\u201d Jones added. Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, attributed some of the gains to the election\u2019s smooth running and, notwithstanding legal challenges, the likelihood of an imminent outcome. Looking forward, McMillan told the Guardian, markets were encouraged by prospects that a Biden administration\u2019s more progressive, high spending proposals are less likely to get through a politically split legislature. \u201cBiden\u2019s economic plan included substantial new corporate taxes and capital gains taxes, all of which would have been very disruptive to the market,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cThe risks from a blue wave and a Green New Deal are now off the table.\u201d Wharton professor of finance Jeremy Siegel also welcomed the result, even as the final outcome of the presidential election remained unresolved. \u201cTruthfully that combination is excellent for the economy and it\u2019s excellent for the markets,\u201d Siegel told CNBC on Wednesday Market enthusiasm for a split government has historical roots going back decades. In 2018, after voters handed control of the lower chamber to Democrats in the midterm elections, markets soared. \u201cThe better-performing periods are periods where the houses were split in terms of leadership,\u201d financial adviser Mellody Hobson noted at the time. Since Tuesday, markets have also been buoyed by the prospect of government infrastructure spending that could also pump billions of taxpayer dollars into an overhaul of the nation\u2019s energy and transportation systems. For big tech, which is facing antitrust investigations under the Trump administration, the political scenario could also be rosy. Ahead of the election, FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) stocks, in particular, showed jitters after months of impressive pandemic gains. \u201cThe Street appears to have gotten the \u2018Goldilocks election outcome\u2019 for tech stocks with no \u2018blue wave\u2019 expected (Senate staying red) and a likely Biden White House now on the horizon,\u201d said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities in an investors note on Thursday. \u201cWith the Republicans likely to control the Senate, the chances of major legislative changes to antitrust law now is off the table in the eyes of investors which posed the biggest risks to tech stalwarts with a ripple impact across the sector,\u201d Ives added. Ives said the likely election outcome was a \u201cgreen light to buy tech stocks\u201d and predicted that big tech stocks could rally another 10% to 15% into year-end. \u201cWe continue to be bullish on owning the secular growth stories for 2021,\u201d he wrote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
