President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono urged people to remember Suharto's achievements after cutting short an official visit to Malaysia to return home to monitor the former dictator's condition. Suharto's heart had stopped and his lungs and kidneys failed on Friday night but he was revived by a team of 40 doctors. He is still on respiratory support and has shown signs of intestinal bleeding, doctors said. A parade of the country's political and business elite has entertained the hundreds of reporters camped outside Pertamina Hospital in south Jakarta since Suharto was admitted a week ago. Even human rights activists have come to leave flowers for the 86-year-old. Five army planes were put on standby to ferry Suharto's body and his family to Solo, in central Java, for the burial after news wires began reporting his rapid decline on Friday night. Vice-president Jusuf Kalla rushed to his bedside, ready to announce the inevitable. It's hard to believe that the subject of all this attention was named and shamed by the World Bank and the UN last year, as the world's most corrupt leader. Transparency International estimates Suharto and his family stole $15-35bn of state assets. He was also the head of the army when it oversaw the destruction of the Communist party, in which more than half a million lives were believed lost. And during his reign as president, secessionists in East Timor, Irian Jaya and Aceh were brutally repressed. 'Suharto had some mistakes in the past, but that should not prevent us from giving our gratitude,' President Yudhoyono said yesterday. 'President Suharto is a leader of this country and has made some achievements, especially in economic development.' Many do credit Suharto with lifting Indonesia out of the economic doldrums. Supporters outside the hospital on Friday held a banner reading 'Father of Development, Indonesia will never forget you'. Helped along by an oil boom, the economy grew consistently above 6 per cent for the three decades Suharto was in power. Living standards rose as people had greater access to roads, schools and electricity and foreign investment surged. But the good economic run came to a shuddering halt with the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Paradoxically, almost 10 years ago to the day Suharto opened the hospital wing in which he now lies. It was one of his final acts as president, before being forced to resign amid riots and international pressure. Suharto will be buried in the family mausoleum, just outside Solo. Preparations are already being made at the site which is surrounded by bamboo groves and sits on the hilltop reserved for the royal family. Suharto's wife is already buried there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
