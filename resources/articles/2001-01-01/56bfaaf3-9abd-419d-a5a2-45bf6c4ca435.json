It provides quite a salutary lesson to those MPs, and even some government ministers, who bemoan the rigour with which prospective adopters are assessed in the UK and compare it unfavourably with adoption in other countries, particularly the US. Indeed, Matthew Engel in the Guardian last year was highly critical of the home study processes applied to his own application to adopt from overseas and described the civilised process in the US as a \"brief discussion over carrot cake and coffee\". It is of course true that there are 52 states in the US, each with its own adoption laws and procedures. Some states have procedures very similar to those in the UK, but there are others where adoption would appear to be merely a formality with very background information about the applicants, sometimes not verified (faxed criminal record checks can be acceptable for example) and few restrictions on the \"expenses\" paid to the parties involved in the adoption (these can be incurred by the birth mother, the agency or \"broker\" and the lawyer). The internet sites which encourage applications to such \"brokers\" are little more than shopping malls where you can trawl through a stream of seductive pictures of small children and fill in boxes to state your preferences - including the age, ethnicity and gender of the child and also asking to exclude all problems you do not want to cope with - for example \"attachment problems\", which are of course an issue to a greater or lesser extent for most children who have no secure families of their own. Costs on such sites are often explicit and guaranteed, differing according to the ethnicity and complexity of the child. It is hardly a surprise that such sites and potential lack of \"intrusive\" home study inquiries will attract some unsuitable adopters as well as people with paedophile tendencies - as child protection procedures improve and access to working with children becomes more highly regulated, such opportunities will inevitably be fully exploited. It is precisely the reason that parliament passed last year the Adoption (International Aspects) Act which will allow Britain to ratify the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption - although it is yet to be implemented, it is to be hoped the delay in achieving this will now be addressed as a result of this current example which has caused such serious concern. The US, however, have not yet ratified the Hague Convention, which is hardly surprising as adoption in participating countries has to be carried out by a not-for-profit accredited body - this clearly was not the position in the case of the internet twins. The convention also requires the country in which adopters are \"habitually resident\" to \"prepare a report including information about their identity, eligibility and suitability to adopt, background, family and medical history, social environment, reasons for adoption, ability to undertake an inter-country adoption as well as the characteristics of the children for whom they will be qualified to care\". Again the Welsh adopters in the twins' case admit they had no such official report and were not required to do so by the US. The inevitable question which must now be asked is why Britain continues to have reciprocal agreements with the US, given the enormous variety in the standards of procedures between different States, many of which would not be acceptable in the UK. Central to all our concerns must be the welfare of vulnerable children who find themselves caught up in any unregulated system of family finding and placement. The potential for unscrupulous, damaging or dangerous practice is all too real. Considerable efforts have been made both in the UK and in the international community in establishing a watertight framework that prevents the exploitation of children needing new families. It is of concern in the current case that significant loopholes have been exposed in the international adoption of children from the US. It is incumbent on the UK authorities to close these loopholes with the enactment of the Adoption (Intercountry) Act 1999 and regulations. It also important that urgent discussions take place with US authorities to ensure that their procedures do not expose vulnerable children to the tragedy and trauma that as been clearly evident this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
