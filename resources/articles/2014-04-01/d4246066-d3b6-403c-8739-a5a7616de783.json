Water sounds, African vocal chanting, softly pattering drums and mournful flute sounds unfold the opening Sunflower Song, while Sinho Zezinho D'Angola is a jubilantly whoopy flute-led dance that feels as if it could whirl all night. Mother Rain is jazzy, with Marcelo Andrade's soprano sax carrying the lazily graceful tune as flute sounds drift amid bird-whistles and chirps. Slow, guitar-like kora chords chime under percussion flurries and cello exclamations, tidal washes turn into songlike ballads, and the shouts and whistles of Awe get a Scottish-jig treatment with the arrival of Zawadzki's stomping violin. It's remarkably tranquil and elegantly executed world music, but it has plenty of muscle, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
