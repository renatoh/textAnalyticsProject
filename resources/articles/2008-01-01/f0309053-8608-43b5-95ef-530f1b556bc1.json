This week, a company launches an online map of central London which includes aerial photography at four times the resolution of existing online maps: the equivalent of looking down from the 10th floor. The map, from 192.com, publishes aerial photography at a resolution of 4cm for London and 12.5cm for the rest of the UK. In the right conditions, images at this resolution are enough to identify individuals - a step that existing online mapping ventures such as Google Earth and Microsoft's Virtual Earth have so far been careful to avoid. Alastair Crawford, 192's chief executive, makes no apologies for the possibilities: \"We're considering holding a competition. We want to challenge people to find out how much naughty stuff is happening. If you're having an affair in London, you'd better be careful!\" The mapping venture is likely to heat up the debate about the extent to which information about individuals is available on the web - especially as 192.com, which specialises in providing data about individuals gleaned from official sources has announced plans to attach estimated ages to every person in its database of 27 million Britons. Getting on the map The prospect is likely to alarm privacy campaigners. Dr David Wood, of the Surveillance Studies Network at Newcastle University, says he is worried by the power of such systems. \"When you combine detailed mapping with demographic data, consumer data and particularly things like credit ratings, you end up with very powerful tools.\" Crawford says he is simply presenting data that is already available, often in a less secure setting than through his website. The London map images, which combine aerial photographs shot over 20 hours last year with data licensed from Ordnance Survey's digital map of Great Britain, are strikingly more detailed than existing services, especially when individuals appear in oblique views. At present, coverage extends from Hyde Park in the centre of London to Dartford Bridge in the east, and Finsbury Park in the north of the capital to Tooting Broadway in the south. The west of London is unavailable because of flight restrictions around Heathrow. The plan to add estimated ages to its listings will help people look up old friends, says Crawford, especially when they have a common name. \"Most people seeking an individual have a rough idea how old the person is. Addresses are very variable, but age stays with you for your whole life.\" The estimated age bands are modelled on data gleaned from a sample of the population using what the company calls \"complex mathematical algorithms\". Several clues are already in the public domain, Crawford says. One starting point is the database of 4 million directors held at Companies House. This is a public record listing dates of birth as well as addresses. From national demographic statistics of age differences between married couples, it is then possible to estimate the likely age of the director's spouse. Another source is the electoral roll, which has an annually updated list of 17-year-olds. If a 17-year-old lives with two people of the same surname already listed in the register, they are probably aged between 40 and 60. Another clue is forename: all other factors being equal, Elsie Jones is probably from a different generation than Kylie Jones. Even house prices, again on public record, can provide a clue: two people of the same name living in a \u00a32m property are probably older than two living in a \u00a3200,000 one. All these can be cross-checked with the average age for the postcode area, which is contained in census data. Crawford says there is nothing new about using information in this way; all the software does is open it up to the non-expert. \"It gives that knowledge without having to be clever,\" he says. \"Our anticipation is it will help people get connected.\" Crawford says he has taken advice from the information commissioner's office. \"We're producing a product as responsible as it can be. 192 provides transparency. It's a safer place for data than the local library. We require users to register with their credit card details and put them through a vigorous verification. We log all IP [internet] addresses, we know what you looked at and we keep a log. If someone is going to abuse personal data, the last place you would get it from is 192.com.\" But, he admits, \"where I think there will be more fuss is when women have been hiding for many years how old they are. But we've always allowed people to have control of data: if anyone wants to correct it, we'll do it free of charge.\" The data is also not provided for mass unsolicited marketing, he adds. Who's watching you? What about stalkers, or worse? \"It's not like the movies where killers pick a victim from the phone book. In the real world, the stalker is almost always somebody who already knows where you are.\" But with public concern about the safety of personal data rising, the directory is likely to come under fire. Crawford says anyone worried about personal data abuse should start with sites such as Facebook: \"It's grossly irresponsible for social networking sites to canvass dates of birth, and publish them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
