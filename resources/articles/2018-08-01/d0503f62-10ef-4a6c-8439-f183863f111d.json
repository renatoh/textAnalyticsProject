No British woman has won a European 1500m gold medal, although Kelly Holmes snatched a silver in 1994 and Laura Weightman a bronze in 2014, but Muir enters the heats on Friday as an overwhelming favourite for the final on Sunday. Muir\u2019s only worries have been a troublesome achilles and a severe bout of hay fever that caused her to run well below par at the Anniversary Games last month, after which she decided not to attempt an audacious 800m-1500m double. But having spent the best part of three weeks training at altitude in St Moritz the 25-year-old believes she is back to her best. \u201cI\u2019ve no fears at all with my achilles now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a little bit irritated this summer but having massages at the camp helped. I\u2019ve not missed any training so it\u2019s really good. The hay fever is fine, too \u2013 there wasn\u2019t any pollen up in St Moritz at all. It\u2019s nice to be here feeling well.\u201d Muir does not have particularly fond memories of the European Championships, having been dumped out in the first round in Zurich four years ago. \u201cI was third on times going into Zurich and I didn\u2019t make the final. Now I\u2019m a completely different athlete both physically and mentally \u2013 I\u2019ve improved so much in both those areas. \u201cI have always been shy as a person and I\u2019m a lot more confident than I was before. I wasn\u2019t used to being in the spotlight and having that pressure to do well. I maybe let the pressure get to me a little bit and it\u2019s taken me a few years to learn how to deal with it and perform. \u201cI\u2019ve overcome that hurdle now and take it all in my stride and always perform better with that pressure. I\u2019ve gone from not making the final to hopefully winning the championship. It\u2019s crazy how far you can come in four years but I\u2019m really proud of myself.\u201d During the past two years Muir has set a number of British and European records at distances ranging from 1,000m to 5,000m, and won bronze and silver medals at the world indoor championships in March. But she has never won an outdoor medal even though she came mighty close at the 2015 and 2017 world championships and 2016 Olympics. The 1500m in London last year was particularly heartbreaking, with Muir close to tears after missing out on a bronze medal by seven-hundredths of a second to South Africa\u2019s Caster Semenya. She insists that failure has only inspired her to strive for more success. \u201cI think about it every now and again but if anything it\u2019s driven me to work even harder,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always worked hard but it\u2019s given me that extra motivation to get on the podium on the outdoor stage and these championships present that opportunity. \u201cI\u2019ve proved myself indoors but outdoors the medals have been stuck on delay. So it would be great to win that title. That would be a big confidence booster ahead of next year.\u201d Muir also admits the absence of Sifan Hassan, the pre-race favourite who has elected to run only the 5,000m, makes her chances even better. \u201cIt will open things up because she is one of the best athletes in the world,\u201d Muir said. \u201cWe\u2019ve raced each other a lot and the head to head is close. But there is no extra pressure. I\u2019m relaxed, and if I\u2019m relaxed I perform well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
