That's what they say. They hear about killings from their parents and teachers. Some even saw their own fathers killed. In the town of Bamiyan in central Afghanistan - where the giant Buddha statues stood for nearly 1,800 years before the Taliban blew them up in 2001 - the young are exposed to violence on a daily basis. \"They are not like western children, who see violence in movies,\" says Hana Makhmalbaf. \"It is something very close to them. A lot of foreigners, who say they are bringing peace, first destroy - and then in the chaos, they never get the chance to reconstruct.\" The huge holes in the rock where the Buddhas once stood are always there in the background at Bamiyan, like giant gaping wounds. Hana imagined the Buddhas witnessing what was happening in the valley below and came up with another reason for their disappearance, a reason that became the title of her new movie: Buddha Collapsed Out of Shame. \"Many people think that if there are statues of Buddha, this represents peace,\" says Hana. \"There was the contrast between what they represented and what was going on in daily life. I wanted to say that the level of atrocity could make even a statue, which has no feeling or humanity, fall apart from the shame of it.\" When the Buddha statues were destroyed, there was international outrage. \"When I talked to the people,\" says Hana, \"they all complained that everybody throughout the world was very worried about the destruction of a statue - but not so concerned with thousands of people being killed.\" Buddha Collapsed Out of Shame is Hana's first feature film. Only 19 years old, she is the youngest of the Iranian film-making Makhmalbaf family headed by her father, Mohsen, an influential, controversial figure. His wife, Marzieh Meshkini, is also a director, as is his prolific elder daughter Samira, 28, who has directed four films and received countless plaudits. Hana's film, which unfolds over the course of a day, follows a five-year-old girl, Baktay, who comes from a poverty-stricken family of cave dwellers. She wants to go to school because Abbas, who lives next door, has told her a funny story he learned there. He tells her she can't go, as she hasn't got a notebook and pencil. So off she goes, selling eggs to make enough money to buy her supplies. On the way, she encounters a group of boys, not much older than her, who are playing war games: some pretending to be the Taliban, others Americans. They hold her hostage, in what is meant to be a game. None of the children had acted before. \"They didn't have television, they had no notion of acting, they had no idea what cinema was,\" Hana says. \"It was very enjoyable because of their innocence and their energy. I prefer to work with amateurs because they make it real. Nikbakht Noruz [who played Baktay] had no experience of school and was familiar with poverty and hardship. She reflected the suffering of the place. Her hands showed the roughness of the girls living like that.\" The film is uncomfortable to watch: Baktay, clearly frightened, is held by the menacing, wild-eyed boys in a \"grave\" they have dug for her. They threaten to stone her for, among other things, not wearing a headscarf. Isn't there something questionable about using a young child, especially one who didn't have any concept of acting or films, in such traumatic scenes? \"I don't think what I have done is immoral,\" says Hana. \"The real immorality has been committed by those who have inflicted [violence] on the people. When the Americans bomb a country, they think they are dropping their bombs on the enemy, but the majority of those who are affected - and killed - are women and children.\" When Hana was eight, she left school and was taught at home by her father. \"Teachers were mostly concerned about whether we had our headscarves on correctly. If we didn't, we were told we would go to hell. Most of our lessons were about ideology and doctrine. At home, I began to learn about art, photography, poetry, cinema; we studied things like mysticism and philosophy.\" At first, Hana wanted to be a painter. \"My father used to put my paintings on walls, to give me confidence. But I could see the impact my father had on society through his film-making, and I preferred that.\" At eight, she made her first short film; at 14, her documentary The Joy of Madness premiered at the 2003 Venice film festival. It was about the making of At Five in the Afternoon, her sister Samira's film about a schoolgirl who wants to be president of Afghanistan; it was shot just after the fall of the Taliban. Does she feel intimidated by the success of her father and sister? \"Cinema is not like a race or a wrestling match where somebody wins and the other people lose,\" Hana says. \"I try to learn from their work and other works. I don't make films to compete with anybody, or to say that I can make films too. My main aim is to provide an impression, or an idea, to make people look at something from a different perspective and to become aware of some of the problems that exist.\" All of her films, and many of her family's, are banned in Iran. \"Film-making has made our family into nomads and refugees,\" says Hana. \"My father, in order to make films, lives abroad and moves from one place to another.\" In 2001, when she made The Joy of Madness, two kidnap attempts were made on her in Kabul. And she is always on her guard in Iran: \"Whenever I leave home, I don't know what will happen to me. Incidents are quite common. I might be arrested by a policeman because my scarf is not quite right. Or, if I walk with my brother, they might come and ask who we are. There might be a knock at the door and I might be arrested - because of my thoughts and the films I have made.\" \u00b7 Buddha Collapsed Out of Shame is out on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
