City were heading for defeat with five minutes left but then Leroy San\u00e9, a former Schalke player, struck a 25-yard free-kick to equalise before Raheem Sterling grabbed a late winner. While City are firm favourites to progress, Guardiola was alarmed at sloppy play that allowed the home side to take the lead via two penalties from Nabil Bentaleb before half-time. He also pointed to Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi\u2019s sending-off towards the end. \u201cWe\u2019re not ready to fight for the Champions League,\u201d he said. \u201cWe gave away the goals and the red card. They didn\u2019t have a shot on target and scored twice. If they\u2019d scored a third or fourth then maybe we\u2019re out. \u201cWe played incredibly well. I\u2019m delighted but it\u2019s not enough. We gifted the goals.Give me this result before and where do I sign? But every stage is more difficult.\u201d Bentaleb\u2019s first penalty was awarded via VAR. Otamendi was adjudged to have handled Daniel Caligiuri\u2019s shot, a decision that took around three minutes to take. The delay came because pitchside monitors for the referee, Carlos del Cerro Grande, did not work and so the verdict was finally taken by the studio-based officials. While Schalke\u2019s second penalty might also have been offside Guardiola had no complaints. \u201cI trust VAR. I have arguments sometimes but not this time. They are both penalties,\u201d he said. \u201cVAR needs time, they will improve. The referee told me the machine was broken. I support the initiative. The referees need help and that is VAR\u2019s intention.\u201d City\u2019s fans can be lukewarm towards the competition yet given the manner of the win \u2013 which started with Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s opener \u2013 Guardiola hopes they may now enjoy it more. \u201cWe need them in the competition. I remember at Bayern, these kind of games mean a lot to the fans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot do it without the fans.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
