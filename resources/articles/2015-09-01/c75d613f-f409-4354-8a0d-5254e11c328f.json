Everton revelled in their riposte to Chelsea\u2019s thwarted pursuit of John Stones but it was the absence of fight, effort and confidence in the champions\u2019 ranks that will have troubled Mourinho most of all. The magisterial Stones was the last outfield player to leave the pitch after a clinical 3-1 victory delivered by a perfect Steven Naismith hat-trick \u2013 header, left foot, right foot \u2013 and exemplary teamwork for every Everton goal. Having performed a Cruyff turn inside his six-yard box to outwit Pedro at one point, Stones made a symbolic U-turn in Evertonian eyes on the final whistle when he applauded all four sides of the stadium and reserved a thumbs-up for the heartland on the Gwladys Street. Goodison roared forgiveness of the 21-year-old who submitted a transfer request at the height of Chelsea\u2019s interest. John Terry also summed up his team\u2019s afternoon in one gesture. It came seconds after Naismith doubled Everton\u2019s advantage from a move that met no resistance as it crossed Chelsea\u2019s midfield. The former England captain picked up the ball and threw it at the feet of Diego Costa. \u201cYou do something,\u201d was the insinuation. Costa never did. Chelsea\u2019s front line of Costa, Pedro, Eden Hazard and Cesc F\u00e0bregas offered nothing. Chasing Everton\u2019s defenders after losing possession appeared beyond them. The visitors\u2019 goal, a magnificent long-range strike from the defensive midfielder Nemanja Matic, was a rare moment of discomfort for Tim Howard. Chelsea\u2019s leaking defence has attracted understandable criticism this season but the lack of protection and effort in front of them was remarkable for a team that swept to the title last season. \u201cI will say one thing and this is true,\u201d said Branislav Ivanovic. \u201cWe were one of the best defensive lines in the last couple of years but this is a team. Not just the back four. Also the players in front. As a team, we played very well and, because of that, we got the results. We have to get back to this form quickly. We have to defend as a team and try to win the games on our defence.\u201d Chelsea dominated possession in the second half yet Everton, with Naismith clinical, Ross Barkley energised and unsung players such as Arouna Kon\u00e9, young Brendan Galloway and Gareth Barry excelling, posed the greater threat. Something is wrong inside the Chelsea changing room \u2013 a place Mourinho did not linger in long after the game. He was on his phone in a corridor outside within minutes of the final whistle sounding on Chelsea\u2019s third defeat in five league games and worst start to a season since 1988. \u201cNo one was kicking off in there, nothing,\u201d said the stand-in goalkeeper, Asmir Begovic. \u201cWe have to pick ourselves up. There are lots of games to go. The guys know we can go on a big run. Once things start clicking for us psychologically, mentally and physically, we can be a very powerful team and everyone knows that.\u201d Asked if the atmosphere around the team was flat, Begovic replied: \u201cThat is probably a fair judgment.\u201d Costa embodied the contrasting attitude between Chelsea\u2019s 6-3 win in the corresponding fixture last season and Saturday\u2019s convincing defeat. The \u00a332m forward scored seven goals in his first four league games in English football and currently has one in five. He is snarling more than scoring and his aggression is channelled solely towards defenders who are wise to his antics, not towards his movement or intent on the ball. Naismith overshadowed him on all counts. The Scotland international was introduced from the bench after Muhamed Besic\u2019s first league start of the season was ended by an early hamstring injury. He departed with the match ball thanks to a bullet header from Galloway\u2019s perfect cross, a left-foot shot at the end of a flowing Everton move and a right-foot finish from Barkley\u2019s inviting pass. It was the first hat-trick by an Everton player against Chelsea since the legendary William Ralph \u2018Dixie\u2019 Dean scored five in November 1931. And to think Naismith considered joining Norwich City on deadline day. Stones was not the only player whom Everton refused to sell this summer. \u201cWhen it came about it was something I thought I had to consider,\u201d admitted Naismith. \u201cWhen you are not playing every week it is hard to look past these opportunities. At my age and having had a few years out with injury you do wonder how long it is going to be before you are playing regularly again. \u201cI am still coming on in games with a good bit of time to play, though, and so that gave me hope that I could still be here at Everton and, when the manager said it wasn\u2019t going to happen, the decision was taken out of my hands. I knew then I just had to work hard and be ready for a day like this. The manager said he saw me as a valuable part of the squad and wanted to keep me. He reiterated after the game that it is a squad game and everyone has a role to play. This is proof of that.\u201d Man of the match Steven Naismith (Everton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
