Building ministers will consider a ban on Friday on the importation of combustible aluminium composite panels of the type that were implicated in the rapid spread of London\u2019s Grenfell Tower fire in June, which killed at least 80 people. The ban is one of several measures on the agenda to toughen up building standards in Australia when the state and federal ministers responsible for building meet in Brisbane. A Senate inquiry called in September for an urgent ban on the sale, use and import of polyethylene composite panels in Australia, which have a polyethylene core between two sheets of aluminium, as a matter of urgency. Polyethylene is a petroleum-based product and is highly flammable. Some panels have a 100% polyethylene core, while others have a mix of polyethylene and a fire resistant material but are still potentially combustible. Once installed, it is impossible to tell the difference without testing the core. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said imports of polyethylene cladding ought to be blocked and has committed Labor to doing so if it wins government. The Property Council of Australia has also backed an importation ban and audit of existing buildings, while the Queensland government will push to prohibit the polyethylene aluminium composite panels. But the assistant industry minister, Craig Laundy, who is meeting with state and territory ministers on Friday, has accused Labor of being ignorant of how the industry works. He said that border controls on dangerous, combustible cladding products were neither practical nor possible and it was already illegal to use the material on high-rise buildings so the law just had to be enforced. \u201cThis product is actually also made by companies in Australia so a ban at the border would do nothing about those companies,\u201d he told ABC radio on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s also used completely legally under the national construction code in things like shop fronts [and] outdoor signage. \u201cYou would be banning across the board something that can be used legally in certain environments but also banning at the border when it\u2019s made domestically\u201d. The ABC host Sabra Lane said some of Laundy\u2019s Coalition senators had warned, after hearing evidence from the building industry, that the national construction code was being breached on thousands of building sites. \u201cWhy is the code a solution when clearly it\u2019s being ignored or wilfully flouted?\u201d she asked. Laundy replied that the code was the law and the role of lawmakers was to enforce the law, which was happening. \u201cThere is an expert report going on right now, we\u2019re looking at compliance in every state\u2019s best practice, every state and territory minister is coming towards the end of an extensive audit of their cities,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in Brisbane, yesterday I was at the hospital here ... they are actually taking panelling off the hospital. There is plenty going on in this space. \u201cScaring people is not the answer ... Blocking at the border, when you\u2019ve got a domestic industry, and also legal applications of the product, is not the answer. \u201cThe answer is that the law\u2019s there. If it\u2019s illegal, enforce the law.\u201d Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
