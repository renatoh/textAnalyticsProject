Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions, said any decision to investigate Cummings must be made by the police. He did not have the power to interfere. Martin Redston, a 70-year-old director of a London engineering firm, had sought a judicial review over the case. At a hearing in London on Tuesday, Michael Mansfield QC said Cummings \u201cappearing to evade any genuine scrutiny for his actions due to government associations is undermining of respect for the rule of law\u201d. Mansfield argued that as Hill had oversight of the prosecution system, he had a duty to \u201cnudge\u201d the police with advice, particularly over new legislation such as the coronavirus rules. In the Cummings case, he said Hill should have \u201cstepped in with some friendly advice\u201d following Durham Constabulary\u2019s three-day investigation, which only examined Cummings\u2019s movements in County Durham including a 52-mile round trip to Barnard Castle. Mansfield said: \u201cHe should have said to the Metropolitan police: \u2018This is worthy of investigation in relation to the circumstances in which Dominic Cummings left his home \u2026 and whether this does constitute a reasonable excuse.\u2019\u201d He also said it was important for Hill to assert his independence from government after the attorney general and prime minister said Cummings had done nothing wrong. Mansfield argued there was a clear public interest in an investigation over a concern that \u201cthe lawmaker broke the law he has made or helped to make\u201d, adding: \u201cIf there is a prominent member of government we say flagrantly not obeying them [the rules], this affects the level of security and health for the rest. The public would be reassured if they knew they had been properly investigated.\u201d Duncan Atkinson QC, for Hill, argued the director of public prosecutions did not have the power to refer cases to the police. In any case, Hill had not made a decision not to prosecute, the court was told. \u201cThere is no decision that can be judicially reviewed,\u201d he said. Permission to review was rejected. Lady Justice Carr, sitting with Mr Justice Picken, said: \u201cThe decision in principle is that this renewed claim for permission to apply for judicial review will be refused.\u201d The reasoning for the decision will be set out later this week. Redston said he would consider an appeal. Speaking outside the court he added: \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed. The ultimate aim of this is to ensure that Dominic Cummings is actually prosecuted for the breach of lockdown regulations. So now we need to consider how we go forward.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
