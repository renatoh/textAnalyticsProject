Nosey parkers can zoom in on streets from 14th to 125th way up in Harlem, by way of Mulberry Street in Little Italy, Broadway and Fifth Avenue, or see what the weather's like at the foot of the Statue of Liberty or the top of the Empire State. If you're planning a trip to the Big Apple, the site will give you a small insight into life in various neighbourhoods, such as Greenwich Village, or show you what kind of people hang out on Bleeker Street. You can also check the progress at Ground Zero, or spy on the shoppers in Times Square. All this might be fun rather than particularly useful, but the website also has lots of handy hints about travel, hotels, shopping, partying and eating in Manhattan, as well as ideas for spending time elsewhere in New York State."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
