Workers on the front line report that almost all would have been perpetrated by residents in their care, many of whom have mental health conditions. The statistics, which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, are being released by the GMB union that represents care workers, ahead of its annual congress, which begins in Brighton today. They show that between the financial years 2013-14 and 2017-18, 6,034 violent attacks on carers resulting in serious injury were reported to the Health and Safety Executive. Of these, 5,008 workers were so seriously injured that they had to take at least seven days off work. A further 1,026 carers suffered a \u201cspecified\u201d injury \u2013 a category that includes fractures, loss of sight, brain damage, loss of consciousness, asphyxia, or amputation. One attack resulted in the death of a carer, the Observer understands. \u201cOur members often tell us about the abuse they have to face at work \u2013 and these figures back them up,\u201d said Rachel Harrison, GMB national officer. \u201cThese statistics are the tip of the iceberg \u2013 they only include the most serious injuries. Our members have to deal with violence on a daily basis.\u201d Violent attacks account for a third of reports involving residential care workers \u2013 compared with just 7% of reports for all workers. \u201cUnfortunately, our members are sometimes put under unacceptable pressure to keep working after an attack when they should be receiving care themselves,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cCare is crucial. But too often the sector is overlooked and the people working in care treated as less than the frontline professionals that they are.\u201d Sarah, (not her real name) who is in her early 30s and has been working in care homes both in the public and private sector since she left school, said attacks were common. \u201cI was talking to a colleague at a desk and a resident rugby-tackled me into a set of metal filing cabinets and then continued to beat me up. I ended up with badly bruised ribs, and he broke my glasses, which cut my face. There\u2019s no ill will towards him at all \u2013 he had a mental illness.\u201d A senior carer with a degree in social care, Sarah had to have two weeks off to recover \u2013 on basic sick pay at \u00a370 a week. \u201cConsidering I was doing 50-plus hours at the time, it was a big wage cut for me,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to happen every day. You get kicked, scratched, spat at, sworn at. I had a friend ask me, \u2018Did you used to cut yourself as a teenager?\u2019 I said no, that\u2019s nail marks from residents over the years.\u201d Despite the abuse, Sarah said that she harboured no feelings of resentment towards the residents she was looking after. \u201cYou care for the person \u2013 you don\u2019t hold it against them,\u201d she said. \u201cNine times out of 10 it\u2019s a mental illness, whether it\u2019s dementia, bipolar or schizophrenia. You understand that.\u201d The release of the figures will help foster greater awareness of the conditions under which carers work. \u201cThe only time you hear about carers in the news is when they attack residents,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cMost homes are chronically understaffed. On average, there are three carers to 20 residents and I\u2019ve even known it to be two carers. It\u2019s not a safe number. Absence is high in that job because people just don\u2019t want to come in. We\u2019ve had so many leave and go into retail.\u201d Part of the problem, she said, was the lack of recognition that carers receive. \u201cA nurse is valued. You tell people you are a carer and it\u2019s just like \u2018You\u2019re a carer, OK\u2019 \u2013 but we\u2019re on the front line. We hold them when they are passing away and do the little things like laying out someone\u2019s clothes to see what they want to wear for the day.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
