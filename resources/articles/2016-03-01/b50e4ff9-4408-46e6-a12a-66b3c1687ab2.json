Several million shifted units and a shift to original material behind her, she\u2019s able to talk about this third album as a \u201ccoming of age\u201d \u2013 at 19. It\u2019s certainly an adult-oriented, mainstream affair, pairing her with producers who have also worked with Adele and Florence and the Machine. Inevitably, big-lunged pop abounds, and the pure vocals first heard on those early indie-rock covers have been applied to slushy ballads about survival. Growing Pains has an intriguing, almost eastern feel, but there\u2019s more genuine personality in Birdy\u2019s quieter, piano-led confessionals. Lost It All and Silhouette are really lovely, and lines such as \u201cI can take my makeup off and put a brave face on\u201d give some idea of how it must have felt to navigate the more pressurised quarters of the music industry at an age when most of us are still at school."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
