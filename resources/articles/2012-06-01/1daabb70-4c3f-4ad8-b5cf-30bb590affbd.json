The programme I was going to do \u2013 Cutting Edge, about lifers at Gartree Prison \u2013 has been moved. Channel 4 thought it deserved a bigger audience than 11 people who don't like football, and postponed it from Sunday until tonight. A good decision: it's extraordinary television, make sure you watch it. Which leaves me with Julius Caesar (BBC4, Sunday). Leaves me \u2013 that's clearly not right; it sounds like Shakespeare is some kind of dregs. Obviously, only an absolute brute (as in an animal, a philistine, not as in et tu) would think that. It's just that I may not be the best person to assess its merits. I've never had the easiest relationship with the Bard. Even now, aged however old I am, I find it hard not to associate him more with homework than with a good time. And with the theatre, sitting behind some tosser who chortles loudly, not because he thinks something is actually funny, but because he wants other people \u2013 especially his date \u2013 to know that he knows that William S meant that line as a joke. Horns, yes, ha ha ha, of course that means whoever it is in the play's missus is off shagging someone one else, ha ha ha, look at me laughing \u2026 Yeah, hilair! Tosser. There aren't too many gags about cuckolding in Julius Caesar, I don't think; this could be the perfect one for me. And Gregory Doran's production is set in a contemporary indeterminate African state with a cast of black British actors speaking with indeterminate African accents. A couple of scenes are shot on stage at Stratford, the rest is filmed on location \u2013 a gritty, grimy, urban location. Cassius, Brutus and Casca plot their dirty deed in a municipal public toilet, complete with urinals; Caesar gets shanked at the bottom of an escalator; Cinna \u2013 the wrong Cinna \u2013 is necklaced by the angry mob, fired up by Mark Antony's oratory. Death by words via a burning tyre. This is badass Julius Caesar. Bard-arse perhaps. Not a chortling tosser in sight. Doran doesn't make a massive deal of the contemporariness, though. There's very little interference, and no sacrilegious messing with the words, thankfully (Julius Caesar's famous last ones aren't: \"You'n'all Brute, issit?\"). I do know \u2013 and appreciate \u2013 that it's the words, the language, which matter most. It's actually very easy to forget where you are \u2013 Ancient Rome, modern Africa; it doesn't matter, the play teleports with little effort. It could perhaps just as easily have been taken to modern day Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Syria even, with a little speculation, the Ides of March moved forward a couple of thousand years into an Arab Spring. The events are similar \u2013 uprising, the toppling of a leader with too much power. And then difficult times \u2013 the eddies and vacuums of the turbulent wake that follows. The themes and issues are similar too \u2013 fate and free will, power and the power of oratory, friendship, loyalty etc. Ah, that'll be the timelessness of Shakespeare, his relevance today. And though Doran doesn't ram it down the throat, it's there for all to see. Even me. OK, so I had to put a little effort in \u2013 you have to, if it's one you didn't do at school. I looked a few things up, read a couple of speeches \u2013 the obvious ones, which are amazing. Mainly I had to get over the big block, the feeling of dread I get when there are two and a half hours of Shakespearean tragedy stretching out terrifyingly ahead. Once in there, though, I'm in there, involved. Hey, I can do this, even if I'm mainly doing so on the level of thriller. I'm sure I'm missing loads, references that would be meat and drink to my chortling friend fly past unnoticed. It doesn't matter. What matters is I'm not bored. OK, perhaps I wander a little in the second half, after the escalator scene and Brutus's and Antony's big speeches, before all the suicides. But I'm blaming the play for that, not me, or this production, which is fantastic. I'll be brutally honest: I enjoyed it. Not just enjoyed; I think I actually got something out of it, too. And if I can, anyone can, so long as they're prepared to put a little bit of effort in. Now I'd better shut up, before I turn into a chortling tosser too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
