In the latter, a group of children discover a homeless man who they believe may be Jesus. In Almond's book, Michael, a young boy, whose life is in turmoil, finds a grumpy sick man called Skellig living in his garage. Is he an arthritic old tramp, a figment of Michael's imagination, or an angel with a dirty face, smelly breath and humps on his shoulder blades where his wings might be? Or could he even be death itself? Birmingham Stage Company's revival of Almond's own adaptation of his novel, first seen at the Young Vic in 2003, may not quite achieve metaphy-sical magic, but it's a darkly glittering couple of hours that makes you see the extraordinary in the everyday and the turbulent intensity of childhood. Between school life and visits to the hospital to see his sick newborn sister, Michael and his wild-child friend Mina take Skellig nightly gifts of aspirin, brown ale and Chinese takeaways. If Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials made room in children's literature for Milton, then Almond does the same here for Blake, suggesting that innocence combined with imagination is a potent mix \u2013 one with the power to change lives. Phil Clark's production neatly side-steps all sentimentality as the story builds to its redeeming climax, and it has an excellent junk-laden design by Jacqueline Trousdale and atmospheric music from composer Jak Poore. There's a game cast, too, led by the gangly Dean Logan as Michael and Charlotte Sanderson as Mina. It may not have the feather-light, multilayered richness of the book, but this is a powerful reminder that the world is full of mysteries, some of which can be explained away and some of which remain unsolved."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
