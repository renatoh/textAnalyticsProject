Detectives detained the men, aged 40 and 52, on Tuesday afternoon on suspicion of manslaughter and brought them to a police station in Dungannon, County Tyrone, for questioning. \u201cThey are currently in custody,\u201d the Police Service of Northern Ireland said in a tweet. The 52-year-old man arrested is Michael McElhatton, the owner of the Greenvale Hotel in Cookstown, County Tyrone, where the crush took place, his spokeswoman has confirmed. It is understood the other suspect, 40, is a member of the nightspot\u2019s door staff. Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and Connor Currie, 16, died after pandemonium erupted outside the hotel on Sunday night. Up to 400 people were queueing to enter a disco when people started to fall in the densely packed crowd. The death toll could have been much higher, DCS Raymond Murray told a press conference on Tuesday morning. \u201cI think that we are fortunate, if that is the right word to use. In these circumstances, we are looking at three deaths ... Bad enough, a horrendous tragedy, but we could easily could be looking at more.\u201d Police have traced more than 160 witnesses and want others to come forward to help investigators understand how the tragedy unfolded. Officers were examining security camera footage and the planning and staffing of the event, he said. Witnesses who were underage and trying to enter a licensed premises should not feel deterred from talking to detectives, Murray said, adding: \u201cI want to reassure you, the focus of our investigation is not the age of people who were at the event; it is about trying to find answers for the families of the three teenagers who tragically died.\u201d Lauren, Connor and Morgan were killed and three others injured when there was a surge in the crowd waiting in cold, wet conditions to enter a door leading to a function room. Condolence books opened in Belfast city hall and in other areas across Northern Ireland and flowers have been left outside Greenvale Hotel. Fresh details of the crush have emerged. In a Facebook post Eimear Tallon described a festive atmosphere rapidly dissolving into terror. \u201cIt started with pushing and shoving but everyone was still laughing and having a good time. Then the literal crushing started.\u201d Two of Tallon\u2019s friends fell and became trapped on the ground. \u201cPeople were scratching, biting and grabbing anything they could to pull themselves up to breathe. I think that\u2019s what really shows the seriousness of it all; people were literally fighting for their lives.\u201d Tallon fell and became wedged between bodies for what felt like \u201cfor ever\u201d until others in the queue dragged her out. \u201cI lay on the ground and opened my eyes. I remember seeing some motionless legs, a few socks and shoes and then I was pulled up and brought away.\u201d Relatives, friends and teachers have paid tribute to the three who died. Briege Parks, the aunt of Connor, the youngest victim, said his family was devastated. \u201c[He was] a wee gentleman. I am so proud to be his aunt.\u201d Catherine McHugh, the principal of St Patrick\u2019s College in Dungannon, called Lauren \u201ca beautiful girl, a shining light in our school community\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
