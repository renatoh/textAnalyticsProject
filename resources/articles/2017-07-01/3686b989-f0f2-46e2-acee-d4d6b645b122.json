Overhead, pigeons and lorikeets fly through the sky, settling every now and then in the grand Moreton Bay and Port Jackson fig trees that line the parks. From a distance the songs of an outdoor religious service can be heard. Meanwhile an elderly woman using a walking frame trundles slowly by. There\u2019s tranquility in this neighbourhood, for now at least. Within days the drilling begins: a new metro station is to be dug here as part of wholesale redevelopment plans for this precious, inner-city slab of Sydney. Never mind that few of the current local residents want or need the station \u2013 no doubt the new residents of Waterloo will. This 19-hectare precinct is to be transformed into the densest residential landscape in Australia. The 30-storey twin towers, Matavai and Turanga, will be razed; so too the lower-rise apartment blocks Solander, Cook, Marton and Banks, as well as a number of other smaller properties . About 4,000 people will be moved on and 7,000 new dwellings will be built in a 70:30 mix of private and public housing. All photographs by Jonny Weeks for the Guardian The current tenants \u2013 the majority of them elderly, sick or vulnerable \u2013 were told the news just before Christmas in 2015. Eighteen months on they are still to learn when they will be evicted and to where or what type of accommodation they will be moved. Promises have been made, albeit belatedly, that those who wish to remain in the area should be able to do so and that the demolition and construction work will be done in stages to facilitate a smoother transition. Nevertheless, the entire project is expected to take 15 to 20 years to complete, longer than most of its residents expect to live. Many of the residents featured below are from the Waterloo public housing action group, a body of tenants and volunteers which is fighting the redevelopment. They want their voices to be heard. These are their homes, their lives and their futures. These are their stories. Catherine \u201cI feel like an animal on the verge of extinction; Waterloo estate is like an animal on the verge of extinction,\u201d says Catherine, a retired school teacher from Melbourne, as she gazes out at the view from her apartment midway up Matavai tower. \u201cWho am I to the developers? I\u2019m just a statistic. Oh, one of the 4,000 people who has to be moved to somewhere else. And maybe we\u2019ll die before they have to think about it.\u201d Catherine moved to Waterloo in 2011 to look after her daughter and now shares her two-bed flat with Finnegan, a toy poodle, and Bobby, a Maltese shih tzu cross. Before moving to the area she had heard Waterloo was \u201ca dreadful neighbourhood and nobody would want to live here\u201d, she says, acknowledging the estate\u2019s troubled reputation regarding drugs, \u201cbut it turned out to be very untrue\u201d. \u201cYou can walk right through from one end to the other and everybody is very cheery and friendly. Having Finnegan helped when I first arrived because everybody loves him.\u201d Catherine is a keen enthusiast of architecture, especially the works of Marion Mahony Griffin, who helped design the city of Canberra. \u201cWhen I go outside I love to look up at these buildings,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you look at them at all different times of day the shadows are different. And when you look at these windows, I know a lot of people don\u2019t notice it at first, but they\u2019re round at the edge and from a distance it makes it look like a film strip. \u201cI certainly think she [Mahony Griffin] would have been interested in the towers as architecture. I think she would think as I do: that the actual buildings are an example of a can\u2019t-be-repeated style of architecture and should be preserved. \u201cBut the value of everything these days is what it\u2019s worth financially, so all those things that you can\u2019t put a value on must diminish. You end up with a very dreadful society, something like [George Orwell\u2019s novel] 1984.\u201d Tee Tee was homeless on and off from 1995 to 2002 before he moved to the Waterloo estate. \u201cAt that point I was just happy to get somewhere that was comfortable and, you know, I didn\u2019t fear for anything here,\u201d the 70-year-old says with a smile. He was born in the US and was a model and a computer programmer before settling in Australia. He had mental health problems and ended up on the streets. \u201cI lived in Europe for about three years doing some runway modelling and photographs in Rome, Paris \u2013 various shows, not the real top ones,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t get paid thousands and thousands of dollars but I enjoyed that period. \u201cThen I moved back to the States, got my masters in accounting and got a job in Saudi Arabia programming their systems for the US and Saudi Arabian governments for 10 years. I had a babysitter for my son, a driver for me, I could fly free whenever I wanted to go. I was making so much money I paid off my house in five years. \u201cWhen I got here [Australia] I was doing really good but all of a sudden one day my mental health broke down and I ended up being homeless. I\u2019d never had to deal with anything that tragic.\u201d Having been helped into public housing, Tee says he feels settled living alone in the Waterloo estate. The prospect of being uprooted doesn\u2019t make him angry but he does want answers. \u201cWhat\u2019s the main reason for it? That\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand. Why? I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t. It\u2019s causing a lot of insecurity and that I don\u2019t particularly like living with. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take me time to adjust, I know that. But that\u2019s nobody\u2019s fight but my own. \u201cAll in all I\u2019d just like to know what\u2019s going on. And the thing is, no one seems to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d Peter Peter thumbs his way through a thick A4 folder looking for the offending document \u2013 the one he received shortly before Christmas in 2015 which announced the redevelopment proposals. \u201cAh yes, here it is,\u201d he says, \u201cthe infamous letter from Brad Hazzard.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re really excited to tell you ... \u201d he trails off, skimming the opening line with incredulity, reading again the letter from Hazzard, written when he was minister for social housing in New South Wales. \u201cThese are marketing types. They must have called up their marketing mates and said, \u2018How do we market this bullshit?,\u2019 and that\u2019s what they came up with!\u201d Originally from New Zealand, Peter emigrated to Australia in 1975 and moved into Waterloo in 2003. When he first saw his apartment on the 26th floor of Matavai, with its panoramic views over Redfern and out to Bondi Junction in the distance, he says: \u201cI took one look at it and thought yes please.\u201d His studio apartment is small but he\u2019s happy with his lot. \u201cThis is my top-level suite,\u201d he jokes. \u201cBut the main reason I like it is because the location is ideal.\u201d Of course, he notes, \u201cthat\u2019s the same reason that those greedy vultures want the land. It\u2019s a prime location. They don\u2019t give a toss about the communities and the people living here. \u201cThe problem with these urban planners is they have a map and a biro in front of them, they make little dots and get a ruler and join them up, and they\u2019ve got a railway line. It\u2019s completely devoid of contact with local people.\u201d Olivia \u201cI was 28 when I had the operation,\u201d says Olivia, a transgender woman who shares her home in Solander with two younger men. \u201cHalf the community don\u2019t really know but I\u2019m not going to lie and deny it because I\u2019m not ashamed. I am who I am now. I identify myself as Olivia, my birth certificate states Olivia and it says female. I\u2019m quite happy with that.\u201d Olivia was raised in the country and says her family struggled to accept her transition but she\u2019s found acceptance in the Waterloo community. \u201cI\u2019ve never had any threats since I\u2019ve lived here. I feel safe whether the boys are here or not. But if we were moved out west I don\u2019t think we\u2019d feel comfortable because of the problems they had out at Guildford \u2013 they had a lot of attacks out there.\u201d Before moving to the estate 26 years ago, Olivia, who is of Irish, English, Mauritian and Aboriginal descent, worked in cabaret and travelled Australia \u201cliving like a gypsy\u201d. \u201cThe first show I ever worked in was the Vanessa Lee show,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was a strip show and I was like the girl who was something different. Zaza Carlotta, that was my stage name. I remember the first time I did a strip I fell over my cape when I was doing Shirley Bassey\u2019s Diamonds Are Forever. It was embarrassing. Memories, huh?\u201d But, she says darkly: \u201cThere\u2019s not much to smile for any more. When you think about what they\u2019re doing to us. It does worry me. \u201cI\u2019ve heard this news before, 10 or 15 years ago. I thought, \u2018It\u2019s a heap of hogwash, it\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019 But now after seeing these shops on the corner closing up I\u2019m starting to believe it.\u201d Lee Late in the afternoon almost every day, hundreds of lorikeets converge on Lee\u2019s balcony. The 58-year-old emerges with a bowl of sugar water and bread, and a feeding frenzy begins. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of birds down here like magpies, crows, butcher birds,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost much to feed them. Billy is my favourite. He\u2019s the loudest, he\u2019s boisterous, he\u2019s the one that everyone complains about because he\u2019s the boss. I know him by his call. \u201cA lot of neighbours don\u2019t like it but I just feel sorry for the birds. Their habitat is being cut down everywhere,\u201d Lee adds, acknowledging the obvious parallel with the plight of residents at Waterloo. Though not a member of the action group, Lee is open to the idea of preserving the estate. \u201cWhen I had a flat inspection the other day they asked me if I would still like to live here now that I\u2019ve recovered from a really bad fall. I didn\u2019t really think about it before but yeah, probably, it\u2019s not so bad. \u201cIt\u2019s just a difficult question at the moment because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. We don\u2019t know if this place is going to get flattened. I think it\u2019s in the \u2018too soon\u2019 basket to form an opinion on it.\u201d Jason and Riley \u201cI didn\u2019t ask to become sick,\u201d says Riley as he reflects on his former career as an all-format tape operator. Living with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, the 45-year-old has little energy and has days where he\u2019s too tired to talk. But today, on the subject of redevelopment, he can hardly stop talking. \u201cWith my illness I\u2019m like a cat \u2013 this is my world in here,\u201d he says. \u201cI can only go to the doctor, I might be able to go to the shop and maybe to the club for lunch once in a blue moon and that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no way I can live anywhere else if I can\u2019t walk to the places I need to go to. \u201cWhen you\u2019re younger moving out sort of doesn\u2019t matter. But I\u2019m getting older and when you live somewhere you think is your home and you\u2019ll be there until you start pushing up daisies, and all of a sudden you\u2019re told you\u2019ve got to move \u2026 \u201cWhere are all these brand-new houses that they\u2019re moving everyone too? How much smaller are these places going to be? Is it going to be like a room in a boarding house?\u201d Riley\u2019s housemate, Jason, 46, is pragmatic: \u201cWe can\u2019t stop it but hopefully they\u2019ll listen to some of our ideas and get some people\u2019s needs into the planning. Our priority is we want everyone to stay in Waterloo. You can try, that\u2019s all you can do.\u201d Masalo Masalo\u2019s smile is infectious. She may be temporarily missing her upper middle teeth but that won\u2019t stop her from baring her emotions. \u201cI love people, I love family, I love children. Anybody,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been here eight years so I\u2019ve built friendships with people no matter what colour or background they come from. When my friends see me they go, \u2018Hi, smiley.\u2019\u201d Originally from Samoa, Masalo moved to Waterloo after escaping a long, violent marriage. \u201cThis a home sweet home for me. It\u2019s a shelter after what I\u2019ve gone through in life. I\u2019m still struggling now and then but I\u2019m happy and free and this is me. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful place to live in. We have space to sit down in the sun, to bounce a ball when my grandkids come, and I\u2019ve got a little garden block down there because I\u2019m an outdoor person. \u201cMy grandkids love it. They say, \u2018Nana, can we go to your garden? Nana, can we go to your garden?\u2019 I go there most days. I grow celery, coriander, tomatoes, ginger, rosemary, parsley, lemon grass. I do a lot of cooking.\u201d With Masalo\u2019s daughter living just around the corner, both are worried at how the redevelopment will affect their relationship. Indeed, the 71-year-old has a proposal for any politicians who support the demolition. \u201cI think it would be a good idea for the politicians to come and stay a week in our homes and see how they feel,\u201d she says. \u201cTell the prime minister to come and live with me, or we swap and I\u2019ll go over there and deal with parliament and he can do my housework! \u201cWe are people, people with heart. We have value. We value ourselves. We\u2019re not animals.\u201d Chester When Chester moved to his 15th-floor apartment in Turanga he was so frightened of the height he spent the first few nights medicating himself with whisky and sleeping away from the window. Now he\u2019s perfectly content eating lunch and drinking wine while gazing out towards the city centre. \u201cI believe in improvement and progress but I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with these buildings,\u201d he says. \u201cThe standard of this building is terrific. Whatever goes up is very unlikely to be as well finished as this. \u201cIt just looks to me like social cleansing. I suspect they want to fill up the place with very rich students from abroad and give them a railway station. As far as I\u2019m concerned any change with these hard-working buildings is connected with that railway line.\u201d The 81-year-old has lived and worked around the world as a translator: Italy on and off for 15 years, then the UK, France, Portugal and latterly Brazil for 25 years. He returned to his native Australia in 2001 when the Brazilian export boom ended but says: \u201cI regret coming back. Utterly. If I had any money I\u2019d be out of here like a shot. I left a country that was a pretty decent place. He adds: \u201cThe department of housing was set up to house people, now it\u2019s trying to make money. Maybe it\u2019ll be privatised like the buses.\u201d In future Chester says he would prefer to live in a more mixed and vibrant community. \u201cYou don\u2019t meet many people in this building. It\u2019s a one-way waiting room before they pack you off to the crematorium. \u201cYou never hear children\u2019s voices. There\u2019s no social life here for me. It\u2019s the opposite of the French quota system where they get so many people of one age band, so many singles, so many professionals, so many blue-collared [in every building]. Oh that\u2019s terrific.\u201d Richard \u201cNever worthless,\u201d says Richard, when asked how he feels. \u201cNobody, not even a New South Wales government could ever make me feel worthless. I\u2019m too strong for that. I\u2019d never allow that to happen to me. But it\u2019s made a lot of people around here feel worthless. \u201cThey [the government and urban planners] have lied to us or been misinformed and didn\u2019t know what the truth was. That\u2019s made me emotionally angry.\u201d Richard is the chair of the Waterloo public housing action group. A former teacher and military veteran who served on two tours of Vietnam, Richard moved to public housing to care for his mother after having handed his financial assets to his pregnant daughter when her husband died in his sleep. He is as generous as he is forthright. \u201cPeople are in public housing by circumstance not by choice,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a story with everybody here. There are many, many circumstances. \u201cThe government see us as a drain on society because we\u2019re not contributing to the economy any more, so they say, but most of us have contributed taxes. I know I did, a hell of a lot of taxes. And if I look back in history a part of the income tax was increased to cover the cost of age pensioners \u2013 I\u2019m wondering what happened to that percentage?\u201d Initially the action group campaigned vigorously to save the entire estate, but now Richard is more pragmatic. \u201cI personally can\u2019t see any way we can stop it, short of another election very quickly to throw this mob out and put somebody in who\u2019s a little bit more compassionate towards human beings and less compassionate towards the big corporations. \u201cSo what we have to do now is fight the winnable fight. If we can\u2019t stop it, let\u2019s go in there and knock down a few walls and make it a bit easier for us. Otherwise if you do nothing you get nothing. \u201cWhenever I draw breath I\u2019ll use every resource I can to negotiate a good deal and fight these mongrels. \u201cI don\u2019t want a consultation, I want a negotiation. The only person I have a consultation with is my local doctor and I don\u2019t have a choice in the outcome. In a negotiation two people can sit down both with an idea and they\u2019ll meet somewhere in the middle.\u201d The action group, which meets on Tuesday afternoons, is attended by residents and volunteers from the wider community. All members have an equal say, whether or not they live in the estate. Richard explains: \u201cCollectively there\u2019s a lot of intelligence here. It doesn\u2019t matter if a person is 98 years old, listen to them carefully because they\u2019ve got 98 years of experience in life and there\u2019s a lot of wisdom there. Give everybody a voice. I\u2019m only the vehicle for everybody\u2019s voice.\u201d Anna Anna is one of Waterloo\u2019s longest-standing tenants. She moved here 45 years ago when Solander was newly built and is among a large community of eastern Europeans in the neighbourhood. Some fear they should not speak out about the redevelopment but Anna refuses to be cowed. \u201cSo many people tell me, \u2018Don\u2019t say anything, they will put you in the jail, they will put you somewhere far away from Waterloo.\u2019 I say, \u2018This is not Russia, this is not communist country.\u2019 What I say is about my life.\u201d Anna has been here so long she recalls when she had a view from her fifth-floor balcony \u2013 now the figs are so tall their canopies envelop it. \u201cThis tree was my size when I came here and look at it now,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been very happy here, of course. In the beginning there was the Salvation Army coming here in the car park. Every Sunday morning they had a band and we come on the balcony and we clap to them. \u201cIn the buildings they used to deliver us bread and milk on the bench outside the door. Now they\u2019ve covered up this. We used to leave the milkman the money and if the milkman is not there nobody would take the money. We miss this.\u201d Having raised her child here as a lone parent, the 80-year-old wishes simply to live out her remaining days in the place she calls home. \u201cIn the night time I can\u2019t sleep because I think, \u2018What will happen to me?\u2019 This is stress, upset, nervous breakdown, worry. We don\u2019t want much. We just want to be comfortable til we die. I just want to be in peace to live here. That\u2019s all that I want.\u201d \u2022 Support our independent journalism and critical reporting by giving a one-off or monthly contribution"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
