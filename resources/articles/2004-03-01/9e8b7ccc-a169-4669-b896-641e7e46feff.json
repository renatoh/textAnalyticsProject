The decision was made after consultations with the clubs and the Spanish government, who asked for the games to continue as planned. However all matches involving Spanish teams will start with a minute's silence in respect of the victims of the bombings and the players will wear black armbands. Uefa CEO Lars-Christer Olsson explained the organisation's decision. \"The events of this morning are tragic and shocking and on behalf of Uefa I would like to offer our sincere condolences to all those individuals and families involved,\" he said. \"Our thoughts and hearts are with the victims of these dreadful attacks at this time. But by playing the games tonight under these difficult circumstances we hope to show to the world the true spirit of fair play and respect in football.\" The news means that Real Mallorca will play Newcastle United tonight as intended, with Barcelona travelling to Celtic, Villarreal hosting AS Roma and Valencia away at Genclerbirligi. Earlier, however, Valencia president Jaime Orti told Radio Marca that to go ahead with the games would be a mistake. \"This is a tragic day for Spain,\" said Orti. \"It's a day when we can hardly be thinking about football and we believe that neither the players nor the clubs are ready to play these games.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I won't have a problem with my weight ballooning. I saw a comment in a magazine the other day suggesting I would balloon up but they don't know anything. I am a slim lad, so I don't put weight on\" - An incredulous Rio Ferdinand responds to suggestions he'll get fat during his extended break, covering the Fiver in a thick gloop of pork pie spittle. * * * * * * * * * * * * WE'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF THIS PLACE The Fiver knows better than to worry too much about pride, but if there's one thing guaranteed to swell our hairy, Union Jack-tattooed chest, it's being British. The first few strains of God Save the Queen, the portrait of the Queen Mum above the mantelpiece, the sound of a car being dismantled by local youths before being over-revved around our estate at 70mph: there's nothing quite like it to bring a tear to the eye and put a song in the heart. So you can well understand our shock this morning, when we heard Christophe Dugarry had left Bongo FC because his family didn't like living in Blighty. Aside from the injuries that have hampered his season, Dugarry says he has ended his contract and returned to Bordeaux to be reunited with his family. \"Frankly I was living on my own in the past six months because my family did not like living there at all,\" he sniffed, raising little sympathy from an email which has lived alone since Granny Fiver moved in with a Chelsea pensioner called Rodrey last summer. \"Since the club have nothing to fear nor to hope for any more we agreed to part company on good terms,\" he sobbed - which, considering his bitter departure from Bordeaux last year, must be somewhat novel. And that feeling was largely mutual. \"I had hoped that he would have gone out in a blaze of glory but it was not to be,\" said a misty-eyed Bernard Cribbins. \"I will never forget why we are still in the Premiership. We wish him well.\" Chairman David Gold, meanwhile, preferred to maintain a stiff upper lip. \"When the family doesn't settle, there's very little you can do. This is one of the difficulties in bringing in some Jonny Foreigner,\" he partly harrumphed, patting a stout bulldog and tucking into a well-done sirloin. So what now for Dugarry? \"I am still very fit but I don't know where I will be playing next season. All I know is that I will ask my family first.\" France it is, then. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Oh dear. Sven's already started picking his backroom staff at Chelsea, with Benfica legend Toni Oliveira the first name on his wishlist. West Ham boss Alan Pardew says he'd love to take Joe Cole back to Upton Park on loan. And Carlo Cudicini's off to Internazionale, apparently. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Good news for Manchester United: the injury Cristiano Ronaldo sustained in Tuesday's Big Cup match against Porto is not serious, and the decorative winger is in contention for Saturday's Manchester derby. And the new Wembley Stadium's futuristic 440-foot high arch has been declared unsafe to raise into position, it emerged today. Some \"minor rectification work\" is apparently required before the showpiece arch is lifted in spring. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO Five: Euro Vase - Liverpool v Marseille (7.45pm &amp; 12.55am) Welcome to Thursday's Interview Hell, which we won't be charging you for.
