But it was crystal clear that in the near future they will be the best of enemies in their ambition to become the captain of Europe's Ryder Cup team in 2006. Arguably Britain's two greatest golfers, they have signed up, along with five others, to represent Lloyds TSB next season. They were unveiled yesterday with Laura Davies and Rebecca Hudson, and are joined by Ian Woosnam and the young guns Justin Rose and Nick Dougherty, who were absent on previous engagements overseas. Apart from Lloyds TSB's new venture into golf sponsorship, questions invariably centred on Europe's memorable victory in the Ryder Cup at the Belfry in September, and on who will captain the team at the K Club in County Kildare in four years' time. This was not surprising since, apart from making the bare announcement, Lloyds TSB was as reluctant to divulge the actual amount of money it was putting up as a bank manager might be to give a direct answer to a request for an overdraft increase. Alan Gilmour, representing Lloyds TSB, managed to evade the question with aplomb. \"We would probably say we are handing over too much; they would no doubt say not enough,\" he said. \"It will initially be a one-year deal, which we hope to renew. We are involved in winter sponsorship through rugby and felt that golf is the perfect vehicle for a summer sport. \"In Colin Montgomerie, Nick Faldo, Ian Woosnam and Laura Davies we have established players, while Justin Rose, Nick Dougherty and Rebecca Hudson represent the stars of the future.\" While their new sponsors ducked the financial bullets, Montgomerie and Faldo were straight down the middle when it came to the Ryder Cup captaincy in 2006. \"It's certainly my objective,\" said Montgomerie, the linchpin of Europe's recent success. \"I've worked under four captains and feel that I have learned different aspects of the role. Nothing would give me a greater thrill than to lead the side. I can probably best explain it by saying that I would rather be there in 13th position as captain than, say, the No11 or 12 player.\" Although that hinted that he felt his playing powers might be in decline by 2006, Montgomerie was in positive mood about the coming year. \"I've never looked forward to a new season with so much enthusiasm,\" he said. \"I feel it can offer so much. I'll be fitter; I'll be using new clubs and balls and I have this latest sponsorship. Everything is in order.\" He will begin his campaign in Los Angeles before heading for the Dubai Classic and then the season's first major - the Masters at Augusta - in April. And his view on women still being barred from membership of the ultra-exclusive Augusta National club? \"No comment. I never like to comment on a no-win situation,\" he said with a smile. Faldo's workload will not be as challenging. He plans to kick into serious action only in September and then attempt to pick up enough points to win a place in the Ryder Cup side for 2004. Failing that he will try to push his claims for the captaincy in 2006. \"Make no mistake,\" he said. \"I really would love that job.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
