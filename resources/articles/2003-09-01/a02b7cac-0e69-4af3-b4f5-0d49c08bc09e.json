In its ruling, a draft copy of which was leaked to newspapers in July, the commission confirmed that the controversial payment had not breached its rules because it was made before criminal proceedings relating to the plot had begun. And it pointed out that the News of the World had notified the police of the payment before the charges were brought against the men. The News of the World reported in July 2002 that a gang had plotted to take the wife of the England captain, David Beckham, and their two sons hostage. Five men were later charged by police, but a judge threw out the proceedings in June after ruling that Florian Gashi, a 27-year-old Kosovan parking attendant with criminal convictions for dishonesty, was an \"unreliable witness\". The PCC's decision to exonerate the News of the World sparked criticism when it was revealed earlier this year, because it coincided with a decision to censure the Guardian for paying a criminal for an article about Lord Archer's time in prison. The editors of all the daily broadsheet newspapers responded by writing jointly to the PCC complaining that the code was not being interpreted consistently and urging the regulator to clarify clause 17, which concerns payments to criminals. But the News of the World today welcomed the ruling, saying: \"We welcome the news that both the press complaints commission and the attorney general have cleared the News of the World of any wrongdoing over the payment made in connection with our Beckham kidnap story in July, 2002. \"The PCC has categorically ruled that this payment was not in breach of the newspaper code of practice, either as it was then or in its new revised form. \"The commission also decided that the payment was both necessary and in the public interest. \"In a separate investigation, both the crown prosecution service and the attorney general confirm that the payment raised no issues of contempt of court or criminality.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
