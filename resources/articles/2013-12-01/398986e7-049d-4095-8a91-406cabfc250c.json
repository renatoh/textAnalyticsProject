One of the country\u2019s leading consumer data firms predicts that overall shopper numbers this month will show a rise compared with December 2012. If correct, this would be the first rise in a year and a clear sign that people are starting to feel more optimistic about the economy. Figures released by Ipsos Retail Performance show that Boxing Day was 1.1% busier than last year. Figures to be published on Monday will show that on Friday 27 December there was a 17.3% increase in the number of people out shopping, which means initial reports that shoppers were staying away from the sales may have been overblown. While numbers were down on the same day in 2012, Tim Denison, director of retail intelligence at Ipsos Retail Performance, said a decline was to be expected given the continued rise of online shopping that saw many retailers start their sales on Christmas Eve. However, he said, the emerging overall trend was a positive one. \u201cWe are quite pleased,\u201d Denison said. \u201cMost retailers will feel content with their trading. We are still predicting that footfall this December will be 0.6% higher than last December, which would be the first positive footfall on the high street for a year and sends a telling message that shoppers are starting to feel more confident.\u201d He said consumers were feeling more optimistic for a number of reasons, including the fact that more people were experiencing a heightened sense of job security, and that inflation was starting to fall. One sector that appears to have performed particularly well has been DIY and homeware. \u201cThis is probably down to the fact that the house market is starting to come back and people seem happy to spend some money on their home, with a view to putting it on the market,\u201d Denison said. While a rise in the number of shoppers on the high street does not necessarily equate to an increase in sales, Ipsos\u2019s data suggests that all the signs are positive and that some \u201cgreen shoots\u201d are evident. \u201cWe are confident that the message from most retailers will be that they have had a solid year,\u201d Denison said. Some sales growth would be down to inflationary pressures, he acknowledged, but those retailers that failed to record a 2% year-on-year gain would be \u201cdisappointed\u201d with their performance. However, not all retailers will be looking forward to releasing their sales figures. Analysts say an aggressive pricing campaign in the food sector will yield casualties. The supermarket chains have fought a bitter war to get shoppers into their aisles in the run-up to Christmas. There is speculation that Tesco may have struggled to repeat its strong performance of recent years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
