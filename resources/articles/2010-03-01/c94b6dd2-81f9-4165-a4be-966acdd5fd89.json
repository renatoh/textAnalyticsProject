Riera was suspended by Liverpool last week for condemning Ben\u00edtez's management style and labelling the Anfield club a \"sinking ship\" in an interview with a Spanish radio station. The Spain international's disillusionment follows a poor season with Liverpool in which the 27-year-old has been restricted to 16 appearances and found his World Cup prospects suffering as a consequence. Both CSKA and Spartak Moscow have shown interest in Riera, who signed for Liverpool from Espanyol for \u00a38m in 2008. Russia's transfer window remains open until 8 April. Riera, quoted in the Russian newspaper Sport-Express, said: \"I suppose that Russia is a very interesting offer because it's the only prestigious league at the moment whose transfer window is open still. Moreover, if I play in Russia constantly I hope to be called to the national team for the World Cup in South Africa. I hope that all the things concerning my move to Russia will be decided during this week.\" Liverpool want \u00a36m for the marginalised midfielder and had hoped to conclude a swift deal with CSKA this week, although the Russian clubs are now proposing a loan with a view to a permanent transfer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
