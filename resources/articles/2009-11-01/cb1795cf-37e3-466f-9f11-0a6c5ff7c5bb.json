Rob Key, the captain of Kent, says he might be the next Wasim Akram. But everyone is agreed that Wayne Parnell is one of the most exciting young cricketers in the world. If you look at his figures you may ask what all the fuss is about. After all, at 20, he has played 19 first-class matches and averages 20.76 with the bat, while his 49 wickets cost 33.24 apiece. Unsurprisingly, he has not played a Test match. But look at his ODI stats. When he took a career-best five England wickets for 48 runs yesterday evening he took his record to 22 wickets in eight one-day internationals at 19.63 each. In his last four matches he has taken three wickets against Sri Lanka, five against New Zealand, three against England in September and then five more at Cape Town, when he and Morne Morkel gave a new cutting edge after South Africa's defeat at Centurion last Sunday. When he plays in the fourth ODI at St George's Park in his home town of Port Elizabeth tomorrowthe England players will have discussed him in detail. A left-armer, he bowls at a whippy pace (around 90mph) and can swing the ball late both ways. He did not swing it much yesterday evening but still troubled the England batsmen with his speed and angle of delivery. He was not an outstanding success for Kent last season when, in five championship matches, he took 17 wickets at 31.11 but when he played against Essex, Geraint Jones, the Kent wicketkeeper, said it was the fastest bowling he had kept to since Steve Harmison in the Ashes series of 2005, when the Durham fast bowler was still at his peak. Key has no doubts about his quality. \"I think he could become one of the leading bowlers in the world,\" he said. \"He reminds me of Wasim. He's got a very quick arm. He trots up with these short little steps and suddenly he's on you. He's a complete natural. He just puts the ball in his hand and runs in and bowls. There are so many theories and opinions with young English bowlers that they all probably have a paper prepared on how to bowl. Parny's not like that. He says that as long as his head is moving towards the batsman he's happy. \"He's a bit of a freak, really, inasmuch as there's not much of him. He's a skinny little lad who can bowl at 90. But he's a winner, he plays without fear and the bigger the occasion the more he enjoys it.\" At Grey High School in Port Elizabeth, where his left-handed batting and leadership qualities also impressed, he was coached by the former Derbyshire left-arm spinner Fred Swarbrook. He has captained every Port Elizabeth age group team since he was 13. He captained South Africa in the Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia last year and led from the front, taking his side to the final. He took 18 wickets, the most in the tournament, and against Bangladesh in the quarter-finals he scored 57 and took six for eight. \"His weakest suit is the longer game,\" says Key. \"He didn't have the patience for it. But he has played so few matches and that could change.He was 12th man in the last Test South Africa played in March and this winter he could face England in an all Kent attack, with Morkel and Ryan McLaren.\" Meanwhile, former captain Graham Gooch will help England prepare for the Test series, which starts on 16 December. English cricket's managing director, Hugh Morris, said: \"Graham is rightly regarded as one of the best batting coaches in international cricket and we are delighted to have secured his services.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
