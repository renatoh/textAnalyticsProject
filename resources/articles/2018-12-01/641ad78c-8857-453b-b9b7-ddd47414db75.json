Instead skipper David Witt\u2019s careful gaze has been trained on his competition in the 100-foot category. \u201cThe only boat to beat is Wild Oats XI. Beat Oats and you win,\u201d said Witt, a veteran of more than 20 skirmishes to Hobart. Asked why last year\u2019s champion Comanche shouldn\u2019t be given the same consideration, Witt is quick to dismiss their win last year as a technicality. \u201cI\u2019m sick of hearing about Comanche. As far as I am concerned they\u2019ve only won one race. You don\u2019t win a boat race with a protest. They\u2019ve won one, Oats has won eight. What does the form guide tell you?\u201d Last year\u2019s protest by Comanche, which saw Wild Oats XI stripped of the line honours and race record, remains a sore point for some ahead of this year\u2019s 628 nautical mile race to Constitution Dock. However the non-traditional victory didn\u2019t mar the celebrations for Comanche\u2019s skipper, Jim Cooney. \u201cI am enormously proud of last year\u2019s effort,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were the first boat across the line that hadn\u2019t broken a rule, and that is a line honours win. There is nothing taking anything away from last year for me. Back to back is a huge achievement, I am hopeful,\u201d he said. The race record holder has an unlikely ally, in the boat she bested for Australia\u2019s top offshore prize. \u201cYou look at the trophy and Comanche won the race last year it is as simple as that. We respect that, there is absolutely no issue at all,\u201d said Wild Oats XI\u2019s skipper, Mark Richards. The eight-time line honours helmsman admits the past three years, which resulted in two retirements, have hurt Wild Oats XI. \u201cThe monkey has been well and truly entrenched, I\u2019ve been trying to wrestle it off big time this year,\u201d Richards said. \u201cThis is the most suitable year of weather for Wild Oats XI in the last 14 years of the race.\u201d Of the enlisted 85 yachts due to start on Boxing Day the handicap win looks like it will be settled mid-fleet. \u201cIf I was going to put a bet on, which I won\u2019t, I would be looking at the 60 to 70-foot range,\u201d said Queensland entrant Black Jack\u2019s sailing master, Mark Bradford. While defending handicap winner Ichi Ban falls just outside of that range her skipper remains hopeful of defending the crown, despite history being against them. The 52-footer, which translates to \u201cnumber one\u201d in Japanese, has had an incredible 12 months on the water and will be the front-marker in the battle for the Tattersalls Cup. \u201cWe have had a great season. We have placed first or second in every regatta we have entered,\u201d said helmsman Mark Allen, \u201cWe\u2019re really looking forward to the conditions. This year\u2019s race also features an entrant hoping to promote an environmental message. Ocean Respect Racing has assembled an experienced crew, including Volvo Ocean racers, for this edition to spread awareness about the state of the sea. \u201cThe harsh reality is when you are out on the water you see the debris and plastic floating around,\u201d said celebrated mariner Dee Caffari, who will race on Ocean Respect. \u201cThe reality now is it is degrading and breaking down to microplastic. The habits we have on land have a massive environmental impact.\u201d This year will also mark the 20th anniversary of the 1998 race, in which six sailors died. Paul Billingham, the Commodore of the Cruising Yacht Club said there had been a lot of discussion about to how best pay tribute. \u201cIt is a significant milestone \u2013 we have had uppermost in our minds for the year how best to honour and recognise that and we have listened to the families,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have decided to do an understated but respectful recognition of those who lost their lives.\u201d The result is a scheduled radio broadcast for 27 December, which will echo the words of the dockside memorial service held two decades ago. While the commodore paid tribute to the safety improvements in the past two decades, he did underline the continued risks associated with the odyssey to Hobart. \u201cYou can never be totally satisfied with everything that has been done. We do all that we can possibly think of. We follow world\u2019s best practice \u2013 in fact we lead best practice \u2013 in making this race as safe as it can be, but at the end of the day ocean racing is an inherently dangerous sport,\u201d he said. The 74th edition of the race will start at 1pm on 26 December, with a weather forecast pointing to sunny skies and a 10-knot east-north-easterly breeze."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
