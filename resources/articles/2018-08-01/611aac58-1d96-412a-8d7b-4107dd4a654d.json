The backbench Labour MP will deliver a speech in Brixton, south London, on Tuesday to argue that ending youth violence should be \u201ca national mission\u201d, after a year that has seen an upsurge in violence, including 21 stabbings of teenagers in the capital. Highlighting the figures, Umunna will say: \u201cThis violence is a scar on our nation, and yet British politics today is incapable of adequately responding to it.\u201d He will argue that the existing political extremes provide no viable solution. \u201cThe populism of left and right both here and in Europe has reduced politics to simple, black and white, tweetable answers to every problem. \u201cOne side thinks the answer is to throw money at the problem and pull the levers of state. The other argues for ever tougher sanctions,\u201d Umunna will say, according to advance extracts of his speech. \u201cNothing illustrates the futility of these responses for me right now than the issue of serious youth violence, which is a complex and a very modern phenomenon,\u201d he will add. Umunna\u2019s speech comes a few days after he was embroiled in a row with Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, who had accused him of using Labour\u2019s row over antisemitism as a method to \u201cprovide rocket fuel for a split in the party\u201d. The MP, often seen as a leader of a pro-remain, anti-Corbyn bloc in parliament, had argued that Labour \u201ccontinues to allow institutional antisemitism to flourish\u201d and the party\u2019s shadow cabinet should have held an emergency meeting to resolve the issue. McCluskey hit back last Thursday: \u201cLet those few Labour MPs looking to break away from the party do so on an honest basis, embracing capitalism, the free market and the alliance with Trump\u2019s America, and not pretend that Labour is something it is not, an institutionally racist party,\u201d he said. The speech to be delivered by Umunna draws on his time serving on the government\u2019s serious violence taskforce, although the press release announcing the event indicated he was speaking \u201cin a personal capacity\u201d and not as a taskforce member. The MP will say that it is necessary to go further than treating youth violence as a public health problem along the lines of Scotland, the solution proposed by the taskforce in its interim report. \u201cYou cannot deliver that model without whole system, cultural and organisational change with sustained political backing.\u201d He concludes that he is proposing a centre-left solution, saying that Tony Blair\u2019s phrase \u201ctough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\u201d was no longer the right place to start the conversation. \u201cYoung men and boys involved in knife crime are not innocent victims. They must be responsible for their actions. But there are larger forces at work that can make it harder to do the right thing,\u201d the MP will say. A Home Office spokeswoman said: \u201cKnife crime has devastating consequences on our communities, and our Serious Violence Strategy signals a step change in balancing a law enforcement response with a multi-agency approach.\u201d She added: \u201cLast month the home secretary announced doubling the Early Intervention Fund to \u00a322m to help youth groups and communities provide young people with positive choices and steer them away from crime.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
