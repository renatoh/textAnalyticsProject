In apparent cahoots with the BBC, the cold-eyed marketing men of the Six Nations seem imminently ready to announce the tearing up of the published calendar for the next two winters to ensure the fixture between England and France takes place on the final weekend of the championship. To all intents, this shameful move to \"seed\" the two strongest teams confirms the arrival of a two-tier, them-and-us competition and at a stroke smithereens the antique design, mystique and mythology of the tournament. A win by Ireland in Dublin on Sunday - and ditto, come to that, by Wales tomorrow in Paris - would make glorious sporting mock of these cynical and blood less businessmen. Couldn't you just hear them grinding their teeth in exasperation as their neat \"profits only\" applecart was tipped over last Saturday during Cardiff's 83rd-minute tragi-comedy and 30-second suspension of credulity, when 24-22 to Wales became 25-24 to Ireland. That ensured this weekend's relishable shootout at Lansdowne Road - and extended the possibility that hard-boiled commercialism would be rumbled should Ireland be defending next winter's title as champions. And think of the tears should Ireland retain the title in 2004 - or another Celtic nation takes it off them - even before England had rumbled into Paris for what would be a woefully flat finale? Emerald eminence hits a drop of all ages Saturday's injury-time drop-goals at either end of the Millennium Stadium were the theatrical equivalent of Manchester United's breathtaking double in Barcelona four years ago. The drop-kick generally can be an irritating adjunct, but occasionally it can be garlanded with luminous substance and marrow. Like on Saturday at the double. Or singly and almost as sensationally by Jeremy Guscott at Durban in 1997. Or five in one game by the Springbok Jannie de Beer, each one explosively engulfing England's quarter-final challenge in the last World Cup. Four years earlier a solitary drop by his predecessor, Joel Stransky, set a whole new nation on a roar in the final - just a fortnight after Rob Andrew's astonishing last-minute pot in Cape Town against Australia. My favourite remains that by an ancient. Jack Kyle was the emerald eminence when Ireland last won the grand slam, 55 years ago. Many still consider him the finest No10 of all. Now 77, Dr Jack retired back to Belfast three years ago after four decades administering to the mission fields of Africa. He will watch Sunday's match alongside some of the few surviving comrades of his fabled 1948 team. Only this winter did David Humphreys overtake Kyles's record of 47 caps for an Irish fly. In March 1956, in the finale in Dublin, it was Wales who were seeking the slam. Dr Jack knew his rugby was almost up and he smiled at breakfast as he read a critic in the Irish Times saying he couldn't be the complete fly-half because in more than 40 Tests he had yet to drop a single goal. That afternoon, with a quarter of an hour to go, Ireland managed a brief flurry as respite from Wales's incessant battering of their line. The Newport full-back GD Owen cleared with a boomer and Kyle caught it just inside touch and the 10-yard line. As the Welsh bore down, he suddenly remembered the Irish Times - \"And so does a fellow behind me in the crowd and I can still hear his stage-whisper to this day: 'Have a wee shot, Jack.' \"So I give it a go, don't I?\" The ball soars high and, still rising, bisects the H from all of 45 yards. Molly Malone rolls down from the (even then) splintery old rafters to inspire two late-late Irish tries to add to his one-and-only drop. Wales wailed. How I fled from running dogs of Ravenhill Only five times in the last century was there a grand slam showdown with the prize attainable by either side - and every time the hosts prevailed. Five times Ireland have gone into the final match needing a win for the slam, four times away, and each lost (Swansea in 1926, Cardiff 1951 and 1959, and Paris 1982). They have never played for a slam in Dublin - the 1948 triumph, of course, was at Belfast's Ravenhill. Down the years, I have covered three or four Ulster matches in the rickety and passionately evocative old stadium - steamy afternoon contests ending in the gloaming at tea-time. There were no telephone points in the press box, and only one payphone in the clubhouse. One day in the 70s, a committee man took pity on my frantic deadline-looming curses at the back of the queue and led me across the park to use the phone at his home. He took out a huge bunch of keys and as, in grave succession, he began to unlock the Chubbs and Vanguards and mortices on his front-door, from the inside two foaming-mouthed mastiffs were snarling venomously at the letterbox in their rage. \"Er, do they bite?\" I tremulously inquired of my telephone samaritan. He looked me in the eye. \"They only bite papists,\" he said. I fled - totally unashamed at missing the first edition. Beating brings noble art into disrepute Saturday was not unalloyed joy for Belfast. A few hours after Cardiff's rugby spectacular, from Glasgow was transmitted the awful dismantlement of their boxer Wayne McCullough. That his licence had been granted only after suspension for two years on failing a brain scan made the sustained beating he was allowed to receive even more disfiguring to the accepted meaning and spirit of sport. Mercifully, he was released from hospital on Tuesday, but his second Kenny Croom and the referee John Coyle should at the very least be pondering their answers to serious questions from the British Boxing Board."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
