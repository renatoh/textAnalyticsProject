A cross between street art and a guide book, they can be found in several cities and, using plaques set into the paving, make urban walking fun and educational. They are often good for brass rubbing, too. The streets of Hull are paved with fish. Forty fish sculptures include those spanning every letter of the alphabet, from anchovies to x-rays and zander. There's subtle humour, with the shark looming by a bank and electric eel beside the electricity sub-station. Start outside the tourist office. Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter has two: the Findings Trail with 30 plaques, and the Charm Bracelet Trail. Each \"charm\" carries a fact about the quarter and the \"padlock\" sits at the bottom of Newhall Hill. The area's myriad workshops produced everything from whistles - including those used on the Titanic's lifeboats - to the first mass-produced pen nibs which democratised writing. Then there were buttons, brooches and buckles; and the original FA Cup. In Highley, Shropshire, a trail takes visitors through this former coal mining village in the Severn Valley. Many of the bronzes include miners' nicknames, such as Flaming Heck, Dick the Devil and Cider Biscuit. The grandaddy of them all is London's Jubilee Walkway. Starting out in 1977 to mark the Queen's Silver Jubilee, it has grown into a 14-mile route. Silver and gold discs, bearing the dome of St Paul's cathedral, guide walkers to sites including Shakespeare's Globe and the old city wall. There's a riverside section between Lambeth and Tower bridges. Local tourist offices have more information; for London see jubileewalkway.org.uk. Take the kids to Glastonbury, Abigail Flanagan Glastonbury is arguably the foremost music festival in the world but a big part of its success is down to the fact that there is so much more to Worthy Farm's extravaganza than just music. Europe's biggest open-air event is also home to Britain's largest free children's festival - Kidz Field - and all children aged 12 and under are admitted to Glastonbury free provided they are accompanied by a ticketholding adult. Like something Willy Wonka might have dreamed up, this year's Kidz Field offers up 1.2 hectares of fantastic free entertainment, education and fun for the family. The big top will feature a vast array of theatrical mayhem, ranging from Bodger &amp; Badger to crime-fighting super heroines; peerless puppeteer Prof Panic and, of course, more clowns than you can chuck a pie at. At the Syra circus big top, kids can try all manner of circus-skills workshops, from unicycling to trapeze, and there will be tales aplenty in the story telling marquee. There will also be all manner of arts and crafts workshops plus Facepak's fantastic face-painting and funky makeovers by the Bindi Crew. Outside the tents, there are numerous rides and games along with a giant, enchanted climbing castle. Weird and wonderful characters will be out and about and adding to the magic but if it all gets a bit much for younger ones, you can decamp to the safe, staffed Little Kidz area, which has everything from soft play to a karaoke stage and a pirate ship. The fun extends way beyond the Kidz Field. The green fields have their own kids area with children's performance marquee; countless arts and crafts activities; a daily programme of theatre, clowning, puppetry and circus shows; skateboard ramp and a superb rainbow warrior climbing frame. The TP field will have loads going on for kids too; likewise, the theatre and circus fields are a must. There are still tickets available for this year's festival, which starts on June 27. So if you are looking for something truly out of the ordinary to do next weekend then dig the tent out of the shed, grab the kids and head to Pilton. Imagine how they will feel waking up each morning to find that they really have run away and joined one enormous circus.

Go to F\u00eate de la Musique, Nikki Spencer You can make an exhibition of yourself in Exhibition Road, SW7 today as the London thoroughfare closes to traffic for a huge free music festival.
