She advises varying runs by length and pace. For three to four runs a week, Arter recommends one faster 5km, broken down into intervals (for example, 10 one-minute or six two-minute bursts, with a short recovery in between); a slower, longer session; and then a couple of 20- to 40-minute runs at a conversational pace. Get to know your running style \u201cEveryone runs differently,\u201d says Arter \u2013 but experience helps. \u201cThe more Parkruns or 5ks you do, the better understanding you have as to what you can tolerate. Experiment \u2013 one Parkrun, try going out a bit harder and see what happens.\u201d Don\u2019t get too caught up with data It is possible to be \u201ca slave to the watch\u201d, says Arter, but \u201cunderstanding how you feel when you\u2019re running is important. Some of the best races I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve just run to feel.\u201d The Team GB and England athletics coach Nick Anderson says he often sees people being too governed by data that may not always be relevant. Arter suggests concentrating on another runner, say 10 metres ahead, as a way to stay focused \u2013 if you catch up with them, look for someone else. If she is really struggling, she will count her steps to 100, then start over. \u201cIt just helps take my mind off it.\u201d Try different routes The Cardiff Parkrun where Arter set the world record is \u201cdead flat\u201d, she says. \u201cThere is no way I\u2019d be able to run that in the Parkruns that are really hilly.\u201d For a new challenge, try some Parkrun tourism. The statistician and runner Tim Grose has ranked the fastest and slowest Parkrun courses in the UK based on last year\u2019s results. Victoria Dock and Hackney Marshes in London were quickest, followed by Worthing in Sussex; Woolacombe Dunes in Devon, Churchfields Farm in Worcestershire and Whinlatter Forest in Cumbria were deemed the toughest. Prepare When you eat before a run is personal preference, but it is important to have something, says Arter, who typically has a bowl of porridge. Making sure you are hydrated long before the run is also key. About 20 minutes before a race, Arter likes to do a 15-minute jog, incorporating some bursts of speed, such as two 90-second hard sprints. \u201cI like to get my heart rate and breathing up, so it\u2019s not a shock to the system when I start.\u201d As for where to position yourself, being at the front can mean you avoid congestion, but you risk starting too quickly, says Arter. \u201cI think it\u2019s just making sure you\u2019re not too far back. If you\u2019re going to fight through people, you\u2019re never going to run a really quick time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
