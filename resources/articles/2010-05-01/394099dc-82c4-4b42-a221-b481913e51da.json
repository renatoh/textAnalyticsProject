Nevertheless, I fancy this spring has been illuminated by particularly bright and notable clusters of birthday-cake candles. Last weekend, for instance, football's Jack Charlton celebrated his 75th and so, this Saturday, does cricket's Ted Dexter. Happy returns all round ... As a 1966 World Cup winner with England, Jack Charlton remains as gung-ho Queen-and-country as they come but, as well, he will forever be high in the canon of Irish saints after the miracles he performed managing the Republic's World Cup teams a quarter of a century later. The day they set off from Dublin in 1994, for example, good St Jack drained his final glass of stout, looked me beadily in the eye, and explained how his no-hopers would shake up the world's fancy dans (which they did): \"As a defender myself, the teams I used to hate were those who'd stretch you, have you haring backwards to the corner flags and then harrying you up your backside. So every single day I tell my boys in green here: 'That's going to be our game, lads, get the buggers turning, get the ball behind them, and stir them up till they're crazy with the annoyance of it all.'\" We called Ted Dexter \"Lord Edward\": for all his 4,500 Test runs at 47, his most resplendently brazen 70 against West Indies at Lord's in 1963 remains one of the most breathtaking short blasts in Test history. It stopped London in its tracks. \"Dignity, majesty, near desperate, quite glorious,\" purred John Arlott on the radio. \"A striking innings, classically erect, like pillars soaring with eagles,\" wrote Alan Ross, almost levitating, in the Observer. My generation's original \"golden girl\", the athlete Mary Rand, logged three\u2011score-and-10 this spring; so did cheery horseman David Broome. Football's two inside-forward immortals were also 70: has the game ever seen two goalscorers of more razor-keen instinct and certainty than Jimmy Greaves and Denis Law? Close-quartered artful dodgers of the penalty area, and bonny smilers both, they each potted literally hundreds of league goals, with Law scoring 30 in 55 Scottish internationals, Greaves a remarkable 44 in 57 for England. His buddy and captain John Haynes once explained: \"Jim would always shoot about two seconds before anyone else even thought he would.\" Same went for Denis. Last month, good Dave Sexton was 80. So was Cliff Morgan. Alas, I never saw the true great Morgan actually play but I remember Bill McLaren describing him at fly-half as \"crafty as a bag of weasels, with scuttling pace and superb balance, he resembled a kind of flying Charlie Chaplin\". And the book Fields of Praise had Cliff in action \"with the ball held at arm's length in front of him, his tongue out almost as far, eyes rolling, nostrils flaring, and a range of facial expressions seldom seen north of Milan's La Scala opera house ... Cliff could jump out of a tackle with an agility that made Harry Houdini look arthritic.\" Morgan's once so mellifluous larynx is not in good shape, so I didn't bother him with a phone call, but I sent a birthday card with an inscription which might have drawn a fond smile of recollection: \"Phil Bennett covering. Brilliant. Oh, that's brilliant. John Williams. Pullin. John Dawes, great dummy. David, Tom David, the halfway line. Brilliant, by Quinnell. This is Gareth Edwards. A dramatic start. What a score!\" Within a month, rugby's other most regal Irish Lion Willie John McBride (five Lions tours and 17 Tests) is 70. And cricket's Frank Tyson is 80: it was \"the Typhoon\" who controversially replaced Alec Bedser in the England team 56 years ago. On Sir Alec's death at 91 last month, Reg Simpson (90 this spring) became England's oldest surviving Test player. Fearless, straight\u2011backed stylist Reg should have played many more than 27 Tests but the captain, Len Hutton, distrusted him because, on tour, he enjoyed reading novels and sunbathing. Some 20 years ago, Reg broke his neck in a serious road accident on the A1. He was on the danger list for weeks, during which time haughty old Telegraph journalist EW Swanton would regularly inquire at Trent Bridge: \"Has poor Simpson left us yet?\" \"No,\" kept repeating the secretary. \"A pity,\" Swanton would say. \"Ah well, so the full and frank obituary I've written on him will just have to wait a little longer.\" He who laughs last. EWS himself died in 2000, that big fat obit still unprinted. And happily, all of 10 summers later, it remains so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
