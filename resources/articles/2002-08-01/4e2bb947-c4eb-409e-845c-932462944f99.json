Few countries escaped the impact of the terrorist attacks on America, but the WTTC predicts that the industry will begin to recover this year and forecasts record growth for 2003. Turkey is expected to be the fastest growing travel and tourism economy over the next 10 years, with an annual growth rate of 10.2%. India comes second at 9.7%, then China at 8.5%. More details of the WTTC's research can be found at WTTC. Two holidays for all Everyone in the UK will enjoy two foreign holidays a year by 2010, as the number of British holidaymakers travelling abroad is set to double in less than 10 years, according to a report published by online travel service Expedia. It says that by the beginning of the next decade we will take 117 million holidays per year, compared to 59 million in 2001, the first time the entire population averaged one foreign holiday. In comparison, just 22% of Americans own a passport. The report, Generation Jet Set, is an analysis of British holiday habits, from the first package holidays in 1950 to 21st century space tourism. It reveals that by 2010, holiday trends will be very different: instead of the usual two weeks of Mediterranean summer sun, we will take more city breaks, activity holidays and spontaneous getaways, and we will be much more flexible in building our own packages over the internet and on interactive TV. City over seaside Retail therapy appears to have replaced bucket-and-spade breaks this August bank holiday, with more people heading for the cities instead of the seaside. Jarvis Hotels, which owns the UK short-break operator Embassy Leisure Breaks, reports that some city locations are running at 100% occupancy for this weekend. Hot spots include London, Manchester, Edinburgh and York, putting the usual August bank holiday favourites of Bournemouth, Brighton and Blackpool in the shade.
