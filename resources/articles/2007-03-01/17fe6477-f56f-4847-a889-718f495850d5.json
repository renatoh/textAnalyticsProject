It seems contrary to nature that such a large group of teenagers is in college an hour before they need to be. Are they unusually keen to get cracking on their studies? Not quite. They are taking advantage of the breakfast offer at Manchester College of Arts and Technology (Mancat). Any student on campus by 8am gets it free. For most of the college's 3,500 sixth-form-age students, this is no big deal. They get a free breakfast at home and extra time in bed. But for a good many, it is their only chance of a decent meal to start the day. Officialdom labels them \"living independently\", that is, not residing with their immediate families. College staff have their own name for them: \"sofa surfers\". Many are camping on sofas or floors in friends' houses, forced to move on each time someone's hospitality has been exhausted. Jennie, 18, found herself living in \"a grotty caravan\" parked in a storage warehouse. Seventeen-year-old Michael ended up camping in a tent in a friend's back garden. Leah, 16, and her 18-month-old son are living with her grandmother. \"She keeps on threatening to kick me out, which means I lose my baby,\" she says. \"We know that approximately 400 of the 3,500 full-time 16- to 18-year-old students are living independently,\" says Jack Carney, Mancat's senior vice-principal. Some have been kicked out of the family home or felt they couldn't continue living there because relations with parents had broken down. Sometimes girls have to leave home because they are pregnant.\" \"They might have moved in with gran, but gran doesn't really want them, or the baby, living there,\" says Rosie Croarkin, head of the college's youth support unit. Up to half of the 400 have been in care and, at 16, have ended up living on their own in a high-rise council flat. Some have found themselves managing a household and family after the death of a parent, or because their mother is a drug addict and their father is long gone. Others might find themselves living in the care of siblings barely older than they are. Social networks Then there are the young asylum seekers. \"We have quite a few unaccompanied asylum seekers,\" says Betsy Sara, assistant principal for student support services. \"They might end up in a one-room flat, which is a place with a roof, but it doesn't have any of the social networks and support that a family would give a young person.\" Apart from the catering team, there is a small group of staff on standby at breakfast to deal with students' needs. \"If a young person comes in and has had a really bad time the night before, there are youth workers on hand to pick up these kind of issues so they might get into a better frame of mind to go into classes,\" says Carney. What kind of issues? \"Getting beaten up, thrown out of home ...\" It is not, of course, a problem confined to Mancat. Colleges in many parts of the country have students in similar situations. In leafy Windsor, a student at East Berkshire College, who had been sleeping rough for seven months because he had been unable to return home after a family row, nearly froze to death during the early February snow, a local newspaper reported. \"Some nights I stay with friends, but I cannot keep doing that. I have been losing friends over this,\" he said. Mancat has a policy of recruiting students in problematic circumstances. This includes young people in the Neet (not in education, employment or training) category and, particularly, in the \"not known about\" category. Of the 15,000 16- to 19-year-olds in the city, 1,470 (9.6%) are Neet and a further 597 (3.7%) are not known about by the statutory services. The college provides childcare for teenage mothers. \"Statistics show that if you don't intervene, they are likely to have a second and third child pre-19,\" Carney says. It is not simple charity on the college's part, points out Barbara Forshaw, the deputy principal. \"We're not just nice to people. It's not the Salvation Army; it's an educational institution.\" The message to students is that the college appreciates they are in difficult circumstances and that education is their route to a better future. Allowances will not be made for them. Challenge and support \"We call it high challenge, high support,\" says Carney. \"We say: we expect you to be here on time for your lessons, well prepared. We don't expect you to miss lessons without a very good reason. If people aren't on time, or don't turn up, we're on the phone within the hour. We expect you to hand your work in on time. \"In return, we will provide you with any personal, urgent support to help you do that. At three points during the year, we sit down with them and assess how they are progressing with the work, and with personal and social issues.\" The free breakfasts, which cost the college \u00a350,000 a year, are part of the deal. Come late and you don't get fed. Students are not allowed to coast. The college's part of the bargain - interceding with housing or benefit applications - lasts as long as a student makes progress. Again, this is not altruism. \"As a college we have to be measured by the same standards as other colleges,\" says Forshaw. \"We get measured by whether our students stay with us, attend and achieve. There's no special dispensation because we work with these client groups.\" How do students view the deal? Jennie says that while she was living in the caravan, her work suffered. \"I wasn't paying attention. I was always tired. I wasn't communicating the way I normally do. I was falling behind with work. But I had to catch up - and I did catch up.\" Chris, 18, now in his second year of a carpentry/joinery course, stopped going to college when he was kicked out of home and ended up in a squat. Mancat wrote several letters to his mother and found money for his travel. Now he is back in college and back home, though still not speaking to his mum. \"The college was good. I'm back and I've caught up,\" he says. Leah, who is doing a childcare course, sees college as her lifeline. Having her baby meant she missed most of her last two years at school. \"If I don't go to college and get a career, then what chance is my child going to have?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
