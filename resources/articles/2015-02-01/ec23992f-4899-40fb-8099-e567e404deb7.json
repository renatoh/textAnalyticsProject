Liang\u2019s lawyer, Stephen Worth, spoke for him when returning the officer\u2019s not guilty plea. The Asian American officer, a 27-year-old rookie, fired a single fatal shot as he opened the doorway of a stairwell during a nighttime patrol of the Pink Houses block in Brooklyn in November. It ricocheted off the wall and fatally struck 28 year-old Akai Gurley, an unarmed black man, in the chest. Liang had not been seen in public since the incident, but on Wednesday he appeared in court following a grand jury decision to indict him. The charges mark the first time in over two years that an NYPD officer has been indicted, and stand in stark contrast to the decisions in the Eric Garner and Michael Brown cases, where grand juries in New York and Missouri declined to indict officers for the deaths of unarmed black men. Liang was freed without bail, and left the court through the public gallery, wheresome of Gurley\u2019s supporters heckled the officer as he walked past. \u201cThe whole damn system is guilty as hell. Indict, convict Peter Liang to jail,\u201d they shouted. Prosecutors argued that the second-degree manslaughter charge, which carries a maximum of 15 years in prison, as well as charges of criminally negligent homicide, assault in the second degree, reckless endangerment in the second degree and two counts of official misconduct, were brought because Liang had \u201cignored training\u201d by patrolling with his gun out and his finger on the trigger. At a press conference, Brooklyn district attorney Ken Thompson told reporters he did not believe Liang had intended to kill Gurley, \u201cbut he had his finger on the trigger and he fired the gun.\u201d Thompson dismissed criticism from Liang\u2019s lawyers that the charges were too severe, and described his investigation as \u201cthorough and fair\u201d. Thompson added that the investigation would not have been possible without the assistance of the NYPD, and paid homage to those officers who arrived on the scene after the shooting and \u201cdropped to their knees and attempted to render aid to save Mr Gurley\u2019s life\u201d. Prosecutor Marc Fliedner told the court that Liang had stood for four minutes at the top of the stairwell after the shots were fired, and did not call the shot in \u2013 as is protocol. \u201cI\u2019m going to be fired,\u201d Liang told his partner in that time, according to the prosecutor\u2019s account. Gurley had descended down the stairwell and collapsed. A friend he was with attempted to perform CPR. Fliedner, however, dismissed as inaccurate reports by the New York Daily News that suggested Liang had texted his union instead of calling for medical assistance. A small group of protesters congregated outside the courtroom holding pictures of Gurley to honour his memory. Mars Acosta, a 31-year-old homeschooling mother who lives a few blocks from the site of Gurley\u2019s death, told the Guardian she believed the indictment was only a small victory in a broader problem of police impunity. \u201cI feel as if this is just an indictment to hush us up in the community. The system is very corrupt. We don\u2019t only want to see just this indictment, we want to see justice for all the lives that have been taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cJustice will be served for Akai Gurley,\u201d said Hertencia Petersen, Gurley\u2019s 49-year-old aunt. \u201cWe will prevail.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
