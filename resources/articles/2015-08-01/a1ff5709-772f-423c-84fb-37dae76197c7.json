The millennium bug is remembered with a titter, if at all. Black-and-white footage of bible-belt preachers railing against the satanic influence of rock\u2019n\u2019roll pop up on post-pub TV. The frenzied cold-war pursuit of other-worldly communist intellectuals, whom, it was feared, would somehow facilitate a Soviet takeover, is likewise a rich comedy seam, not least because that takeover never came. One classic case study is MI5\u2019s obsessive surveillance of the novelist (and later Nobel laureate) Doris Lessing, details of which have now emerged amid a trove of historic documents which have been released under hazily drafted disclosure rules that the agency seems more or less free to interpret as it pleases. In between snooping on Lessing\u2019s travel, letters and telephone calls, agents found time to commit to the files various judgments about her \u201cplump build\u201d and attractiveness, but there\u2019s not a fraction of the insight that the writer Jenny Diski, a teenage ward of Lessing, has recently been sharing with readers about the late author\u2019s eccentric habits and motivations. Had it been important for national security to know what Doris would do next, and what made Doris tick, the state would have been squandering resources on finding out next to nothing. But, of course, it wasn\u2019t important at all \u2013 and a less ideologically blinkered agency than MI5 might have appreciated that at the time. Even if she had wanted to, Lessing would never have been in a position to infiltrate anything for the Soviets since she was open about her Communist party membership. Until, that is, she walked away from the party after Moscow crushed Hungary in 1956 \u2013 a public divorce which should have caused Britain\u2019s security state to walk away from her, and yet it didn\u2019t. She continued to be deemed suspect and to be surveilled for several more years, not only because of her past, but also her support for less-than-respectable causes, such as CND and African nationalism. It almost seems quaint in retrospect, but there are real lessons for today. First, treat the security state\u2019s demands for new powers with caution, since these powers could end up being directed on the wrong targets. Second, be particularly suspicious of the line of argument that maintains that those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear. Lessing had nothing material to hide, and yet \u2013 unless she was freakishly indifferent to privacy \u2013 would have had fair reason to fear MI5\u2019s prying eye. Finally, be aware of how a context of conflict can polarise opinion and create alliances which will look discreditable for all sides. Looking back, it is plainly disgraceful that British agencies were ready to pass tips about this anti-racist to apartheid South Africa and colonial Southern Rhodesia. The defence at the time might have been that on the other side of the ideological aisle were all sorts of characters who, unlike Lessing, were prepared to excuse Soviet brutality in eastern Europe. As Jeremy Corbyn is rounded on over some of the dubious characters he has shared platforms with in the hope of promoting justice and dialogue in the Middle East, London\u2019s anti-communist connections with Pretoria are a reminder of the dangers of lapsing into a black-and-white world view where \u201cmy enemy\u2019s enemy is my friend\u201d. That is a lesson, however, not only for one side in any conflict, but for all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
