He genuinely does seem to love the game above all else, including himself, which is far more than you can say of a few of his colleagues in senior coaching positions. This week on Essendon\u2019s dedicated PR vomitorium Fox Footy TV program The Hangar (don\u2019t mock me for being the only non-Essendon supporter who could stomach more than three minutes of that) and in his various media engagements this season, Thompson has exuded a twitchy but plain-speaking likability not otherwise associated with the Bombers in recent times. Which brings us to the inevitable awkwardness of James Hird\u2019s headline-grabbing return to Australia after a period of study and, guessing by the way his hair now seems to be modelled on that of late-90s Robbie Savage, relaxation in France. Will Hird really rock the boat post-Round 23 and return for a potential Bombers finals appearance? Extending that hypothetical to an admittedly exaggerated degree, would he take the reins from Thompson if the Dons made it to the final week of September? Goodbye door-step press conferences, hello John Terry. Under the guidance of Thompson, the Bombers have occasionally been brilliant and with him as their public and media figurehead, opposition supporters have maybe even stopped throwing their remotes at the TV in disgust. If Hird waltzes straight back in for the finals, you couldn\u2019t blame the PR department for downing tools. * (Update: Keep those tools in your hands, PR people \u2013 Hird will not coach the Bombers until next season. Essendon chairman Paul Little has confirmed the soon-to-be-not-banned Hird will stay away from the coach's box until the current season is over. So no John Terry moment, after all.) It seemed like a good idea at the time Despite all of our whinges about the AFL fixture list, who\u2019d really want to take the job on themselves? Leading into the season the gloriously-coiffured Gillon McLachlan must have thought he was on a winner with this Friday night clash; a finals-bound Tigers side with a tough road trip against what was likely to be a much-improved Eagles outfit. Instead, and with no disrespect to the retiring Dean Cox, we have a game of such low stakes that the league may as well pull one of the Panasonic Cup banners out of the archives department. So it\u2019s all about Cox, really. What an achievement for the giant ruckman to have forged a decorated career and rise above all of those terrible puns. Not many players can say that they redefined a position as fundamental to the game as the ruck, but with his deceptive speed, athleticism and skill, Cox consigned the lumbering giants of yore to the scrapheap and ushered in a generation of similarly-dynamic acolytes. The six-times All Australian tasted the ultimate success as a lynchpin of his side\u2019s 2006 Premiership team and claimed its Best and Fairest award two years later. Those are impressive spoils for a gangly and unfashionable kid who slipped to pick 28 in the 2001 Rookie Draft. The Eagles were thumped at home last year against the Tigers and with both these sides being among the least predictable in the league, it\u2019s toss of the coin stuff. If the upsets in the first half of this round taught us anything, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t entirely write off games like this. The Q-Clash actually has some ramifications this time As far as great sporting traditions go, the poor Q-Clash hasn\u2019t even drummed up as many headlines as Brendan Fevola\u2019s Mad Monday sex toys during its four years on the football calendar. In Wayne\u2019s World parlance, it\u2019s sort of like being magically whisked away to\u2026 Delaware, but Fevola\u2019s one-time club-mates at Brisbane will be hoping that a lack of buzz surrounding this clash won\u2019t necessarily translate into a down-tempo game. Gary Ablett is still missing for the Suns, so the Lions might consider themselves a chance of knocking their cross-state rivals off course for a debut finals appearance. As ever, they\u2019ll need to be at their absolute best to do so. The other point of interest with St Kilda upsetting the Dockers in the first half of the split round is where a win would position the Lions in a race to the bottom for the number one draft pick come November. A win might put first pick beyond their reach. Justin Leppitsch\u2019s side will be outmatched for depth and polish but they\u2019ve hung tough in the last month and even managed that surprise win against North Melbourne. Should the more-fancied Gold Coast side get up for a win, they\u2019ll momentarily push Collingwood out of the eight and then face the prospect of very winnable games against St Kilda, Carlton and West Coast in their run home. I like those odds. Your match of the round: Hawthorn v Sydney The upsets of last weekend most certainly lifted the split round out of the doldrums but this encounter between the Hawks and Sydney is unquestionably the most anticipated match of the round. The Swans prevailed in the corresponding Round 8 clash at ANZ Stadium but the Hawks can now call upon Sam Mitchell, Luke Hodge and returning defender Josh Gibson, who will closely guard his friend and former team-mate, Lance Franklin. That clash earlier in the year featured a comprehensive midfield thrashing as Dan Hannebery, Kieren Jack and Josh Kennedy took the game out of Hawthorn\u2019s hands, but other factors will be at play in the roomier expanses of the \u2018G. The Swans have banked 12 wins on the trot now, so should go in favourites and there\u2019s also a possibility that they\u2019ll regain Kurt Tippett, whose dodgy knee has been a continued source of concern. The upside is that Franklin, who kicked 2.7 against his old side earlier in the year, is hitting his straps and for now dispelling most of the vehement prognostications that he\u2019d be a destabilising influence in the harbor city. When Hawk Jordan Lewis appeared on Fox Footy\u2019s AFL360 this week, he and Bulldog veteran Robert Murphy agreed that the Swans were now playing about as well as any team in football history. That\u2019s a huge worry for the Hawks. A decisive away win on the road would under-line Sydney\u2019s Premiership favouritism in bold ink. The Crows have a tough one before a gentle run home Two teams who were reasonably big on pre-season talk but have provided their fair share of disappointments in 2014, Collingwood and Adelaide now find themselves a couple of scrappy dogs fighting for the same bone underneath the dining table. Those puzzled by the recent sight of Dane Swan stationed ineffectively in the Pies forward arc got an explanation this week when it was revealed that the star midfielder is battling plantar fascia inflammation under his heel, which is as nasty as it sounds and likely to keep him out until finals time. That\u2019s if September action is even on the cards for Collingwood. Better news came in the form of Jamie Elliott\u2019s return from a hamstring injury. Though the weather should be kind to the Pies for this home game, a 4:40pm Sunday timeslot is not. Stand by for your weekly dose of Eddie rage. Strangely, Adelaide probably don\u2019t have to win this game to remain a credible chance of a finals spot but they will leapfrog the Pies if they do. The Crows were creditable in a two-goal loss to Hawthorn last week and beat the Pies in the corresponding Round 9 clash. This is actually the Crows\u2019 last genuinely tough assignment, with winnable home games against West Coast, Richmond and St Kilda, plus a trip to Brisbane putting them in a solid position to make their late-season run at the eight. To miss out from here would be a failure of significant proportions and Adelaide coaches have been turfed for lesser failures."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
