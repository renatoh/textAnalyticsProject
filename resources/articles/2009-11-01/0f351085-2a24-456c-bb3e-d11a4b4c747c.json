Conducting without a score, Maazel looked as if he were doing everything anyone could possibly require: beating time and turning to cue instruments with brisk efficiency, with the occasional flamboyant gesture thrown in, but he made little audible impression on the sound being produced. Kod\u00e1ly's Dances of Galanta opened the programme. While each lyric scene and dance succeeded the other fluently enough, it was only the sinuous clarinet solo that made true impact, and the gear-changes from clodhopping to whirlwind really only registered as moments when Maazel drew attention to himself like a ringmaster with a circus troupe. Thanks to the Philharmonia principals delivering the big solos with their customary flair, Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition were all identifiable, but there was no attempt on Maazel's part at any fine graduation of dynamics or phrase-shaping. The result was wooden and perfunctory, lacking in anything that might be termed atmospheric, unless one counts the crack of an imaginary whip to accompany the cymbal crashes in the final Great Gate of Kiev. The only redeeming feature of the evening was the playing of soloist Simon Trpceski in Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto. The Macedonian characterised every facet of the music with his typical fastidiousness and some blazing cadenza passages. Yet, save for the pianissimo sheen of the strings, Maazel's accompaniment resorted to the kind of vulgarity that used to give Tchaikovsky a bad name. Trpceski deserved better, and so did the audience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
