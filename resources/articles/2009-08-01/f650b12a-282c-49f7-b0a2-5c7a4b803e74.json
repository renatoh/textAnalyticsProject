Emerging from Hull's KC Stadium late on Wednesday after giving arguably his most complete performance in a Spurs shirt, the 26-year-old alluded to the signing of Crouch, but said he believed the real explanation for his form was that extra fitness work during the summer had made him fitter and stronger than at any in his career. The hat-trick against Hull, and the two goals Defoe scored for England in the friendly against Holland two weeks ago, represent a clear statement of intent at the beginning of a season which ends with the World Cup. \"To be honest when I got injured last season I felt maybe it was a blessing in disguise,\" Defoe said. \"I was out for 12 weeks and just felt I wanted to come back a lot stronger than I was before. During the season it's difficult to put in so much work in the gym when you are playing week in, week out. \"I do a lot of work with Les Ferdinand in training and I speak to Wrighty [Ian Wright] a lot, I spoke to him the other day and he said to me: 'You're playing in a good team, you know you are going to get chances. Just hit the target.' \"He said: 'During a game, if you hit the target four times, you are going to score two goals.' And I think it's true. I've always said that when you are playing games and you look like you are going to score, you will score, but if you don't have that confidence, that's when you have to start looking at yourself.\" It was Defoe's first hat-trick since 2004, but his all-round contribution to a team performance characterised by pace and intelligent movement was considerable. If there was a moment which encapsulated his efforts it came during the second half, when moving away from the City goal, he ran to the left touchline to pick up what was essentially a hopeful clearance rather than a pass. Coming in from a more favourable angle, the City right-back, Bernard Mendy, looked favourite to get there first but Defoe comfortably out-paced a player who is himself no slouch. He controlled the ball with a touch and then held off Mendy's attempt to take both ball and man with such strength that his opponent bounced off. Defoe's overall game has been as impressive as his record in front of goal this season. His first spell at White Hart Lane tailed off when he faded from Juande Ramos's plans, struggling with confidence and form, and he left for Harry Redknapp's Portsmouth in January 2008. Having joined up with Redknapp for a third time at Tottenham earlier this year, Defoe is thriving. Redknapp, who has known the striker since he signed him for West Ham as a 16-year-old, has no doubt the hours Defoe has spent pressing weights has made a noticeable difference. \"He's got more power and strength in his upper body, and it's helped him an awful lot,\" Redknapp said. \"He holds the ball well and he holds people off better.\" Having picked up only two points from their first eight games last season, Spurs have now won two out of two and will travel to West Ham on Sunday with their confidence understandably high. \"Everyone spoke about getting off to a good start because we didn't want to go through what happened last season again,\" Defoe said. \"This time around everyone is on it, everyone looks sharp in training. \"The Liverpool game gave us so much confidence but it was very important to go to Hull and get the three points. Now we have to carry it on in the next game.\" He dismissed suggestions he was in danger of peaking too soon. \"When Thierry Henry had his great seasons in the Premier League, scoring 25 goals, he always got off to a good start. It helps you as a forward to get your goals early, it sets you on your way confidence-wise. I don't want to be relaxed and say, 'Well, it's a long season, I just want to take it easy.'\" In the circumstances, it is hard to imagine Defoe will not start against his former club. \"I hope so. The thing is, the competition is good for the club. We've got some fantastic players and you can see our strength in depth from the fact that Roman Pavlyuchenko didn't even come on. He's been on fire all pre-season, he's scored for his country. So it's mad really. In every position at the club people are fighting for places and they are up for it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
