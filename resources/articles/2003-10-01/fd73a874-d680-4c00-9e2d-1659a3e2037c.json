The purple peaks of the Isle of Arran tower behind, and smoke rises from the chimney of a tiny cottage. Three stark telegraph poles in the foreground add a suggestion of Calvary. Aitchison painted Goatfell, Isle of Arran in 1993. It's a large work and you could drown in it, sucked in by the resonant colours; it is contemplative, spiritual. 'Colour is his starting point,' wrote his first dealer, Helen Lessore, and she was dead right. A glorious colour feast assaults you in this exhibition, the first the Academy has staged for Aitchison since he was elected an academician in 1988. The intimate Sackler galleries upstairs are a perfect backdrop for works that vary hugely in size. The walls have been painted midnight blue and the lighting dimmed, so the colours are emphatic. Curator Cecilia Treves has hung the pictures in groups of topic, colour and mood rather than chronologically. An exquisite 1988 Crucifixion with a bright yellow background, belonging to the Duchess of Westminster (lucky woman), hangs adjacent to the yellow-backed Uncle Tom Still Life (1973) of a little piece of china. The famously huge Dog in Red Painting sits comfortably alongside a tiny picture of a Chinese whistle on a red background. But look closely, and what initially appears as a dog standing on a red plain is in fact a subtle gradation of three different bands of colour, the depth enhanced by a line of bright green along the horizon that peters out halfway across the canvas. And the dog stands by a tapered stick that echoes the shape of its tail but anchors the foreground. Small wonder that Aitchison has said: 'I suppose what most irritates me is if someone says I'm a \"na\u00efve\" artist.' The influence of the Church is strong - there are many of his crucifixions here, including one from Liverpool's Anglican cathedral. They are never morbid or maudlin, but they do have a spirituality. He experiments endlessly with the colour and shape of the background, sometimes hilly, sometimes flat. A curious sheep or dog will stand at the base of the cross, or two birds sit on the crossbar. Born in Edinburgh in 1926, his grandfather was a minister in the United Free church, the 'Wee Free', and Craigie grew up assimilating this austerity along with his father's reaction which was to take his family to churches of other faiths. Aitchison became an artist comparatively late in life. He originally studied law (his father was the first Labour politician to hold the post of Lord Advocate of Scotland) and it wasn't until after he'd sat his bar exams that Aitchison switched to art, studying at the Slade under William Coldstream and Robert Medley, along with Michael Andrews, Paula Rego and Euan Uglow with whose work he shares a certain isolated quality. His early palette was more muted; Wall and Fields at Tulliallan (1960) is a landscape of telegraph poles framed by leafless trees in blues, greens and browns, reminiscent of the Australian outback works of Sidney Nolan. The colour scheme is similar in Pope Walking in the Garden (1957), a scurrying, white-clad cleric on a path in a brownish winter landscape. Aitchison was inspired to do this on a holiday when he and fellow student Myles Murphy drove a London taxi to Italy. The cab blew up and they were helped by a Vatican cleric who eventually stored the vehicle in the Vatican basement, and it was while looking out of a window at the palace that Aitchison got the idea. The portraits in this show bear testament to Coldstream's strict measuring principles which Aitchison has always acknowledged. As a keen colourist, he often used black models and there are four fabulous portraits of his favourite model, Georgeous Macaulay, against bright backgrounds. And, of course, Aitchison's other abiding influence is his Bedlington terriers. He first saw the breed at Crufts in 1971, and bought Wayney that year, immortalising him and a series of other terriers in many works. Wayney Going to Heaven is unforgettable, as the terrier floats skywards under a new moon in a Chagall-like dream. \u00b7 Laura Cumming is away Three to see Brian Griffiths Vilma Gold Gallery, London EC2, until 20 Oct Last few days to see gallery filled with a wagon loaded with salvaged wooden furniture.
