Now that he has quit as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, it\u2019s time to set the record straight. You see, he wasn\u2019t just protecting the environment. He was protecting our president\u2019s soul. \u201cMy desire in service to you has always been to bless you as you make important decisions for the American people,\u201d Pruitt wrote to Trump as he shuffled out of government. \u201cI believe you are serving as President today because of God\u2019s providence. I believe that same providence brought me into your service.\u201d You can believe in the science of climate change if you like. Scott Pruitt believes he is a saint, which you can clearly see from his many martyrdoms. For starters, he wasn\u2019t asking his security detail to drive around looking for Ritz-Carlton moisturizing lotion for the sake of his complexion. People outside the EPA have no idea just how much rising temperatures can dry out a cabinet official\u2019s skin. Think of it more like a federal exploration of how climate change affects the epidermis of the executive branch. Speaking of hotels, what kind of malice does it take to suggest that his desperate need for a used mattress from a Trump hotel was some kind of prima donna exercise in sucking up to his boss? You don\u2019t need to have a Harvard medical degree to know that a good night\u2019s sleep might be all that separates us from a newly negotiated Paris climate deal. Yes, of course people have gossiped endlessly about our tireless protector of the environment seeking out a meeting with the CEO of Chick-fil-A to scope out a job for his wife. But honestly, their chicken is rather delicious, even if their politics are not. Besides, how are you going to sell environmental protection to Trump Country without a huge supply of fried food? Some people have sounded shocked that Pruitt would want cut-price accommodation from a Washington lobbyist, or get his young staffers to pay his hotel bills without reimbursing them. But in a cabinet stacked full of super-wealthy Mnuchins and Cohns and Rosses \u2013 never mind the less-wealthy Trumps \u2013 Pruitt was just a poor boy making good. All those camels couldn\u2019t pass through the eye of a needle like a man who spends lobbyist and staffer money. Saint Scott is an epochal figure, it\u2019s true. The founding myth of Trumpland is a tale about the superpowers of the Grand Wizard who survived the black magic of the FBI, the plague of fake news, the video horrors of Billy Bush, and of course the email sorceress known as Hillary. On his way to draining the swamp, our very stable genius wizard has slayed a few dragons called Comey and Truth, but also waved his wand over ugly frogs called Vladimir and Kim. For many moons, our wizard warded off evil by keeping Saint Scott inside the bubble of his benevolent spells. Just last month, he used his protective cloak to single Scott out for special treatment. \u201cEPA is doing really, really well,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody has to say that about you a little bit. You know that, Scott.\u201d The wizard\u2019s minions told us how he was protecting not just Scott\u2019s front, but also his rear. \u201cWe\u2019ve got your back,\u201d was the message, curiously told to the evil media who delighted so much in punishing the protector of the environment. \u201cKeep your head up,\u201d the wizard said. So what does it say about the wizard\u2019s strength now that Saint Scott is gone? If Trump magic can\u2019t protect someone saving our president\u2019s soul through the power of providence, then who is safe in Trumpland? First a Bannon, then a Scaramucci. You fire an Omarosa, then you lose all Hope. You reject a Rex but you can\u2019t get your Gorka back in the bottle. It\u2019s almost like there\u2019s some invisible hand steering this bizarre sequence of hirings and firings, but we can\u2019t figure out what the hand is trying to do. Or if it\u2019s a left or right hand. Or if either hand knows they are connected through the same torso. It is somewhat easier to discern a pattern in Trump\u2019s attitude towards the planet. The real scandal of the Pruitt era was not the personal corruption \u2013 not the millions spent on personal security or the thousands spent on a soundproof phone booth. No, the enduring scar left by Scott Pruitt is the political dismantling of the EPA itself. In year one, he rolled back regulations protecting clean water. He scrubbed away references to climate change and stopped collecting data on methane emissions. He blocked regulations designed to cut emissions from cars and power plants. And don\u2019t expect the scar to disappear any time soon. EPA administrators come and go, but Trump cares for the environment the way a logger cares for the rainforest. Pruitt\u2019s deputy is Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who used to be chief of staff to James Inhofe, the Republican senator for Oklahoma, perhaps the loudest and dumbest climate denier on Capitol Hill. Wheeler is the kind of fossil fuel guy who enjoys the Onion\u2019s parody of him as a pulsating black sludge. Making America Great Again does not extend to the land, water and air we know as America. Wheeler will now serve as the acting administrator, and likely successor to Saint Scott, in much the same way as a fox looks after a henhouse. As if by magic, the fossil fuel industry has taken over the agency that was supposed to protect our environment from the worst effects of that industry. But their new man is enough of a Washington insider to avoid the personal scandals that brought down his old boss. So farewell, Saint Scott. You were the worst. EPA administrator. Ever. May you feast on Chick-fil-A in what\u2019s left of the pastures that lobbyists have handed you. And may providence protect whatever survives your EPA.
