Sources at News International confirmed the sizeable increase, which came after the Times flooded the market by doubling the print run of its London tabloid to 150,000 last Thursday. When the Times went tabloid 13 days ago it was selling an extra 20,000 to 30,000 copies a day, but an increase in availability in the London region has had a marked impact on sales. \"The Times has had the benefit of the Independent going tabloid ahead of it, therefore consumers have understood the message of going from a broadsheet to a tabloid,\" said Tara Marus, a director at media buying agency BJK&amp;E. \"You could look at the Independent as being a victim of its own success. I know quite a lot of people who started buying the Independent because it was in a tabloid format, but as soon as the Times went out they switched to the Times,\" Ms Marus added. \"The Independent tabloid probably took readers away from the Times in the first place and maybe those readers are now going back to the Times,\" said Jane Wolfson, who is in charge of non-TV and radio buying operations at media buyer Initiative. However, running twin editions of the papers will be a financial millstone in the long-run and one of the key performance indicators for both Independent and Times bosses is the ratio of tabloids to broadsheets sold. In November the audited sale of the tabloid Independent was 47,568 a day, accounting for more than one-fifth of overall sales. In contrast, sales of the Times tabloid have so far made up less than 10% of its total circulation. Ms Marus also warned the tabloid versions of both the Times and the Independent could have a cannibalising effect, with readers simply switching allegiances rather than attracting those who do not buy a newspaper regularly. \"The Independent and the Times will erode the market rather than growing it. People will change from being a broadsheet consumer to a tabloid consumer - and you're also giving people who already read tabloids broadsheet editorial within their preferred format. Freesheets such as Metro will take a hit as well.\" In its first week the Times tabloid was estimated to have sold around 50,000 copies a day and boosted net circulation of both formats by between 20,000 and 30,000. However, Simon Kelner, the editor-in-chief of the Independent, said that the indications his paper had received suggested the Times had not made such significant gains. He added that since the Times launched its tabloid version, sales of the Independent have dipped in London between 1,000 and 2,000. \"From all the research that we've done within the industry there's nothing to suggest that their gains are that substantial. But one thing we know for sure is the effect it's having on our sales continues to be very minimal,\" Kelner said. Times owner Rupert Murdoch sanctioned the launch of the tabloid after the News International chief executive, Les Hinton, and editor, Robert Thomson, flew to New York with a dummy version at the start of last month. Mr Murdoch admitted he would have been \"ridiculed for debasing\" the Times if it had been the first broadsheet newspaper to bring out a tabloid version and said he was \"glad\" the Independent had gone ahead first. George Brock, the Times managing editor, also thanked the Independent for \"mowing and rolling the lawn\" for the Murdoch title. The Independent launched its tabloid in the M25 region on September 30, and has since extended the format to the rest of the south-east, the south coast, the north-west and to some parts of East Anglia, with plans to launch nationwide in early 2004. The Daily Telegraph and the Guardian, which have prepared their own tabloid dummies, are monitoring developments at their rival titles closely. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
