It got so bad a friend said I needed to call the mental health crisis team.\u201d With no specialist care available Friend, now 36, was given tranquillisers and antidepressants, which required her to stop breastfeeding. After six months she was able to go off medication, only to relapse 18 months later, when she became pregnant with her younger son. \u201cI woke up feeling really sick and I felt all the anxiety coming back, and this time it was even worse. I was almost catatonic, lying on the floor in the kitchen. No one could make me speak or move.\u201d With no mother and baby units in her area \u2013 the closest is in Poole, Dorset \u2013 Friend spent a week on a standard psychiatric unit, which she remembers being far from suitable: \u201cBecause I was still being sick all the time I was needing to eat little and often,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI went to the kitchen to ask for some toast and the chef said: \u2018No, nothing between mealtimes.\u2019 I told him I was pregnant. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve heard that before.\u2019 \u201d Staff from a new specialist team intervened to send Friend home, prescribing antidepressants. Again, the recovery was mixed: \u201cI never got fully well when I was pregnant, but about 10 weeks after the birth I was completely back to normal again. I stayed on the drugs for two and a half years and started to wean off, but when I got to a low level I had a massive relapse. \u201cI went back on the drugs and they didn\u2019t work, and had to go through all sort of different drugs till I found one that did. It\u2019s only really in the last month I\u2019ve recovered from that relapse.\u201d Friend in part blames the long wait for psychotherapy: \u201cI only had my assessment a month ago \u2013 my sons are seven and four \u2013 and I\u2019m now on a two-year waiting list. If, after I\u2019d had the eldest, I could have had talking therapy, when I came off my drugs I would have had some strategies to fall back on when I started to relapse.\u201d The experience has affected her. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that I won\u2019t have any more children. I always wanted loads of children, but my episodes are so severe we just think the threat to the family is too great.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
