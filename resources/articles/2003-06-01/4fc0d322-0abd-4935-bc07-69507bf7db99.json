Steve Winwood, who joined the Spencer Davis Group at the age of 15 before forming Blind Faith with Eric Clapton and Traffic with Jim Capaldi, lives in an enormous country pile in Gloucestershire. When we drive into the hedge-lined gravel courtyard we are told by a gardener that Winwood is in his studio, so we go round the back of the house to search for an old barn or some other likely music-making outhouse. Then we bump into another Winwood employee, who informs us that the studio is a short drive round the corner. It turns out to be an entire farmyard. After accidentally chipping off the paintwork of his manager's Ferrari with our car door we meet the man himself, in the cavernous stone room where his new album, the Hammond-heavy About Time, was recorded. Winwood seems almost oblivious to the extent of his riches. Although the walls of the studio hold framed cover artwork of the many albums he has worked on, and each radio play of the Spencer Davis Group's Keep On Running helps toward the gardener's wages, he passes through it all with the air of a man detached from the world he has built around him. The stack of vinyl records that he has dug out from the vaults look almost lost in the huge room, while a Hammond organ stands in a freight box in a corner, waiting patiently for Winwood's forthcoming world tour. \"My brother Muff had a jazz band when he was at art school, and they used to rehearse at our house,\" says Winwood on the beginnings of his career. \"I would ask if I could play piano with them, and I must have done the job all right because then I found myself playing with Muff and Spencer Davis professionally. But if you were a piano player, you were at the mercy of the rubbish piano in a pub. I realised that a Hammond organ could solve the problem.\" The Hammond organ was the invention of Lawrence Hammond, a clock maker and amateur home organist who wanted an instrument to replace the church organ. The Hammond was used by black churches in America, and it was there that jazz and R&amp;B musicians first heard the possibilities that the instrument offered. Winwood grew up listening to that first generation of Hammond players, including Jimmy Smith, Booker T, Jack McDuff, Charles Earland and Richard \"Groove\" Holmes. \"A lot of the early R&amp;B was organ-based,\" says Winwood. \"I liked songs like the mod classic Hi-Heel Sneakers by Tommy Tucker, which had a particular sound that intrigued me. Most of the people who played in that style are now either dead, like Jack McDuff, or very old, like Jimmy Smith who I saw at the Jazz Cafe in London last year, so I wanted to bring it back.\" Another Hammond-playing R&amp;B musician who was one of Winwood's early heroes is Jimmy McGriff. \"I saw him in New Orleans a couple of weeks ago. He's in a wheelchair now, but he plays with his right hand while a fan plays the parts for the left hand and operates the pedals.\" He digs out Jimmy McGriff's album The Last Minute, which features a cover shot of McGriff looking sharp. \"A hell of a nice fellow. He doesn't look anything like he does on this album cover these days, though.\" Philadelphia is the home of the Hammond organ musician. \"They're almost all from there for some reason,\" says Winwood, pulling out an album called Gon' Doggett by the Hammond pioneer Bill Doggett. \"Doggett laid the foundations of what was to become rock'n'roll by playing bebop and jump jive, a mixture of jazz and R&amp;B that somehow merged with rockabilly and bluegrass.\" The Sermon by Jimmy Smith, from 1958, was a landmark Hammond organ record that opened up Winwood to the instrument's unique timbre. \"The Sermon was a 20 minute track that took up the whole of side one, and it faded in and out so it probably went on for a lot longer in the studio,\" he says. \"Art Blakey played a steady backbeat on it, like a rock drummer rather than a jazz drummer, which is why I like it. My tastes don't go towards jazz. I was lucky enough to work with Tito Puente before he died, who played a lot of bebop music in the early days of jazz, and he always said that when you could no longer dance to jazz, he could no longer play it. So while Charlie Parker went off and did his thing, Tito came up with the mambo.\" Ray Charles in Person, from 1960, was a huge influence on Winwood. \"The best jazz R&amp;B album of them all. I was at secondary school in Birmingham when I first came across it. We didn't have a record player back then, but we did have an eccentric uncle who built a refrigerator, knitted a stair carpet, and made a tape recorder, which he gave to us. We would record music played on Jazz Hour on the American Forces Network, and Ray Charles came on. I had never heard anything like it.\" Why did the British youth of the early 60s pick up on blues and R&amp;B in the first place? \"Aside from the trainspotting mentality of the average teenage boy, you have to remember that at that time, blues was world music,\" Winwood replies. \"It was no different from African or Indian - it was hard to find, and it came from another world.\" Having spent a lifetime listening to Hammond-based R&amp;B, funk and soul from the US, Winwood is now discovering music from the rest of the world. \"The bassists for my new group are Walfredo Reyes, who is Cuban, and Jose Neto, who is Brazilian,\" he explains. \"But Walfredo's favourite drummer is John Bonham, who came down the road from me in Birmingham. Jose's big heroes are Hendrix and Zeppelin. That's the way the world is now - if you go to Africa now they all love Bob Marley and hip-hop. The old-fashioned boundaries don't exist.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
