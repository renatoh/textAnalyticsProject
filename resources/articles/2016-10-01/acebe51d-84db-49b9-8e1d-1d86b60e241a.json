The Boss made the admission during a Wednesday interview on BBC Radio 2 when asked to address a rumor that he had written a song called I\u2019ll Stand By You for one of the Harry Potter films. \u201cThat is true,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t use it.\u201d Springsteen said he wrote the song for his eldest son. \u201cIt was a big ballad that was very uncharacteristic of something I\u2019d sing myself,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it was something that I thought would have fit lovely.\u201d Springsteen said he he\u2019s still hoping to have it included in a \u201cchildren\u2019s movie of some sort because it was a pretty lovely song\u201d. According to Springsteen fan forum BruceBase wiki, the song possibly dates as far back as 1998, and was inspired by Springsteen\u2019s experience reading the Harry Potter novels to his son. The site alleges that Springsteen offered the song to director Chris Columbus, who directed the first Harry Potter installment, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone in 2001. Author JK Rowling is said to have had a contract stipulation that prevented the use of commercial songs in the Harry Potter films. On Wednesday, members of Trainspotting\u2019s crew claimed that Oasis turned down the chance to feature on the soundtrack for the classic because Noel Gallagher presumed the film was about actual trainspotters rather than an adaptation of Irvine Welsh\u2019s black comedy about heroin addiction in Edinburgh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
