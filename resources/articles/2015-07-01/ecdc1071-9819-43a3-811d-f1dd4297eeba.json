George Osborne, the chancellor, in the first undiluted and much-lauded Conservative budget for 19 years, promised \u201ca new settlement\u201d; a high-wage, low-welfare society, a one nation economy that \u201cwill make work pay\u201d. In a move that initially left Labour in \u201cdisarray\u201d (a word used by the former chancellor Alistair Darling), he stole many of Ed Miliband\u2019s clothes. The chancellor, having established a narrative that he is a fiscal hawk (aided by Labour\u2019s depiction of him as a ruthless cutter, when in fact the scale of cuts was no different to that proposed by Darling in 2010), deployed a budget aimed at addressing the nation\u2019s finances, but, more significantly, at attempting to reshape society in ways that will only become clear in the next five years. Lastly, he deployed the contents of his red box to try and reshape the political landscape and leave Labour with an increasingly narrow set of options on which to attack his strategy. But only an intellectually challenged Labour leader won\u2019t be able to find plenty of room on which to harry a Conservative administration whose work on Wednesday may well reap a different kind of harvest to the one intended. The Conservatives have rediscovered the phrase one nation in the last few months. It\u2019s a laudable concept, but merely saying it won\u2019t will it into being. And Wednesday did little to bring it closer to fruition. As the Financial Times noted yesterday, the budget, far from sounding credibly one nation, \u201cmight just as easily be seen as a lobby group for the already prosperous and propertied. [Osborne] is now vulnerable to bleak reports of hard-working Britons whose \u2018living wage\u2019 has turned out to be no such thing.\u201d As ever with Osborne, it is instructive to look at the data, not the oratory, as a useful guide to assess the credibilty of his offerings. The data doesn\u2019t lie. The non-aligned Institute for Fiscal Studies says that since he became chancellor, Osborne has announced measures that have meant the poorest 30% of the population lose more than the richest 10%. The IFS also said that 13 million families will lose an average of \u00a3240 a year. But it is its calculation that 3 million families \u2013 in the \u201cworking poor\u201d bracket \u2013 will lose \u00a31,000 a year that casts Osborne\u2019s rhetoric in such cynical light. Meanwhile, rich pensioners are protected and inheritance tax is relaxed just as low-paid workers lose their tax credits. The richest 10% will lose \u00a3350 a year and the next richest 10% will lose virtually nothing. As the director of the IFS concluded: \u201cThe changes are regressive \u2013 taking much more from poorer households than richer ones.\u201d The hit is forcefully directed at those low paid, in-work Britons. Strivers, you might say. As Labour MP Frank Field noted: \u201cOsborne has strung out millions of strivers who will be made worse off.\u201d Meanwhile, critics of the rise in the minimum wage unanimously pointed out that any benefits would be undone by the slashing of tax credits. But that is not to say that there weren\u2019t welcome elements to Wednesday\u2019s budget, not least the cutting of tax relief on buy-to-let mortgages, initiatives on apprenticeships and changes in tax relief on pension contributions for the better off. And there is no disputing that the bill for tax credits has become unsustainable. In 2003, when Labour brought in working tax credits and child tax credits, it did so to redistribute wealth and make work pay. But the bill has grown from \u00a32bn to \u00a330bn a year and Osborne\u2019s reasonable charge is that too many employers are being unduly compensated by the taxpayer. But it\u2019s difficult to see how one can make a claim for this being a one nation budget. Unless by one nation, we mean that we are relaxed about cutting adrift the bottom 30% while baking in advantages for the \u201cprosperous and propertied\u201d. Osborne might be calculating that cultural shifts are afoot that suggest that is precisely what Britain is happy to do \u2013 that the postwar solidarity built around Labour\u2019s 1945 manifesto has fractured. He may be right and we may be entering an age of more limited resources where those who have are keen to keep and those who haven\u2019t are locked out. Osborne has form on not delivering on macho language. Though glorying in the idea of being Ruthless George, he is nothing of the sort. In 2010, he promised that he would reduce Britain\u2019s budget deficit to \u00a337bn by 2015. It\u2019s now standing at \u00a389bn. And the so-called rebalancing of the economy, which Osborne promised in 2010, has not even come close to being realised. The chancellor\u2019s performance has been portrayed as canny political crossdressing coated in the ashes of Labour\u2019s defeat. He has been hailed as a brilliant political strategist. Perhaps, but there is another script being burnished by Boris Johnson, who yesterday said that the Conservatives need to be \u201cchampions of the poor\u201d. By 2018, when the prime minister is expected to stand down, the country\u2019s millions of \u201cstrivers\u201d will have noticed that Osborne has picked their pocket to the tune of \u00a31,000 a year. At that point, Wednesday\u2019s budget might just be seen as the work of a chancellor who lacks the humility to recognise that slogans in the absence of delivery don\u2019t always translate into political capital. If Osborne\u2019s one nation dream starts turning into a nightmare for 3 million hard-working families , then his lifelong political nemesis will be poised to take advantage. As Gavin Kelly, writing in today\u2019s Observer says, in relation to Osborne calling what is actually a higher minimum wage a living wage: \u201cJust because I call my cat Rover, it doesn\u2019t make it a dog.\u201d Calling this a one nation budget doesn\u2019t make it so. The danger for Osborne is that people start to realise that the script doesn\u2019t match the performance. On budget reduction he has failed spectacularly to meet his own targets. And now this. The danger is that people realise that Osborne has gone from being a promising chancellor to one who over-promises. That\u2019s the point that clever strategy starts to look like cynical personal ambition. With a flood of handy headlines, Osborne reached his political zenith on Wednesday evening. That\u2019s always the most dangerous point for a politician. Osborne may yet rue the day he short-changed hard-working Britons and assumed they could be bought off with a phrase, not a raise. Slogans don\u2019t pay the bills, as Osborne is about to find out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
