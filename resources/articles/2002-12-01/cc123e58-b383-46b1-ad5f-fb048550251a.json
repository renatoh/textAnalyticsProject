That is by no means a foregone conclusion as both the remaining British representatives in the competition face tricky fourth-round opponents. Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier with lock horns with his old friend Guy Roux, the coach of Auxerre who masterminded a Champions League victory over Arsenal at Highbury earlier this season. Celtic meanwhile have to play VfB Stuttgart who are currently fifth in the Bundesliga. Houllier is more concerned about a definite French fight than a possible Battle of Britain. \"I have always wished to meet a French club since I arrived here and this is the first time,\" he said. \"I have waited five years and that is long enough. We are the only two teams coming from the Champions League stages and I am sure it will be an exciting tie.\" Houllier became firm friends with Roux while in charge of Lens and also during his spell as French national coach. But the two men sealed an extraordinary relationship as they both recovered from life-threatening operations just over 12 months ago. \"Guy is a manager I have known for a long time and practically a year ago we were both in the same hotel in Corsica recuperating from operations,\" said Houllier. \"He had a heart by-pass and I had my heart problem, so it was strange that we ended up spending Christmas together in the same hotel. \"We have known each other for a very long time because he was the manager of Auxerre when I was manager of Lens. \"He is a manager I respect and that makes it a very special draw for me.\" Celtic manager Martin O'Neill was also unwilling to talk about possible future ties, but was just pleased still to be in the competition after beating Celta Vigo on away goals last night. \"It was a fantastic achievement for us to beat a Spanish side, something we have never done before,\" he said. \"Last year we were put out on penalties by the eventual Spanish champions and it was nice to go through against a team who are riding so high in La Liga. \"To be able to look forward to European football after Christmas is fantastic and it is something that we will enjoy.\" If Liverpool and Celtic did progress over the two legs and yet another Battle of Britain ensues, it will be a repeat of their first-round clash in 1997-98. Then Liverpool progressed on away goals after drawing 2-2 at Parkhead and 0-0 at Anfield. That tie will always be remembered for a fantastic last-gasp solo goal from Steve McManaman, which earned Liverpool a draw in the first leg in Glasgow. The draw in full: Slavia Prague (Czech Republic) v Besiktas (Turkey) Hertha Berlin (Germany) v Boavista (Portugal) Malaga (Spain) v AEK Athens (Greece) Lazio (Italy) v Wisla Krakow (Poland) Anderlecht (Belgium) v Panathinaikos (Greece) Celtic (Scotland) v VfB Stuttgart (Germany) Porto (Portugal) v Denizlispor (Turkey) AJ Auxerre (France) v Liverpool (England) Ties to be played February 20 and February 27."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
