It was 2001 and the guitarist and \u201cband mum\u201d had tamed egos, anchored stressful tours and clung tight as his bandmates swerved into electronic music. Now, the five-piece had nothing to prove, and he had slipped underwater. \u201cI took St John\u2019s Wort, a herbal antidepressant,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt scared the fuck out of me. It numbed me.\u201d O\u2019Brien, now 51, was numb to everything back then, except for chronic back pain \u2013 a cruel irony for the child from a family of osteopaths. To recuperate, he and his girlfriend flew to Brazil, where they met a pair of friends. An encounter with a healer, they told him, may have saved their lives. He took the address. \u201cGoing to a healer was against everything I grew up with,\u201d O\u2019Brien says, speaking from self-isolation in Wales (he is now healing again, this time from suspected coronavirus). \u201cI told friends and family, and they\u2019re like: \u2018You\u2019re fucking mad.\u2019 In Britain \u2013 especially a place like Oxford \u2013 that\u2019s the realm of fantasists.\u201d The healing resembled an intense therapy, drawing from wisdom similar to \u201cCeltic spirituality, these old connections\u201d. When it was over, \u201cI wanted to share this profound experience with the world, and of course it\u2019s thrown back in your face.\u201d Still, leaving Brazil, he felt childlike. He remembers thinking: \u201cMagic exists!\u201d Last December, O\u2019Brien, under the name EOB, released his debut single, Brasil, a folktronica odyssey inspired by the country\u2019s music and magic. The single precedes the release of Earth, a new album made with a band including the Invisible\u2019s Dave Okumu, top-flight jazz rhythm section Nathan East and Omar Hakim and producers including the U2 and PJ Harvey collaborator Flood. Elsewhere, Laura Marling duets on a Celtic ballad, and a clutch of rave-rock tracks nod to Primal Scream\u2019s Screamadelica. As if to declare independence from Radiohead, O\u2019Brien opened his first gig with a cover of Layo &amp; Bushwacka!\u2019s club smash Love Story. His songwriting aspirations go back to 1996, when Radiohead embarked on OK Computer. He planned to propose some material of his own, before self-doubt \u2013 and deference to Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood \u2013 got the better of him. Making Earth, \u201cI kept asking: what would they think?\u201d he says. \u201cBut that was stopping me stepping fully into me.\u201d Has Yorke heard the album? \u201cNo. Philip [Selway, drummer] asked, so I sent it to him. But I wouldn\u2019t want to do the U2 thing\u201d \u2013 smuggling music unbidden into people\u2019s phones. He smiles evenly. \u201cIf they want to hear it, that\u2019s great. And if they don\u2019t: whatever.\u201d Radiohead met at school in Oxford. O\u2019Brien\u2019s parents split when he was 10, in an era before people realised \u201cthe trauma on the children \u2026 I think that\u2019s when music became my refuge.\u201d When he wasn\u2019t cradling his Sanyo portable cassette player, he gravitated toward cricket and theatre. In a school production of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, he played the charming Lysander; during a rehearsal, the misfit scoring the play swore at the teacher, and in Yorke, O\u2019Brien found a fellow outsider. As he remembers it, the moment they decided to form a band is when his life came into focus. As Radiohead rose from oddballs to celebrity refuseniks, O\u2019Brien stayed grounded; he upgraded his mother into Madonna\u2019s seat at a 1997 gig to improve her view. His supporting-actor good looks charmed reporters, which perhaps fuelled the band\u2019s tall tales of his transgressions. For posterity, he denies angrily flipping a table at an LA restaurant (\u201cnearly, though\u201d) and \u2013 through appalled laughter \u2013 discovering brawny US rock while touring American strip clubs. In another anecdote \u2013 told by Yorke, seemingly to divert a prying reporter \u2013 O\u2019Brien is said to have got so belligerently drunk after a tour that he drove a housemate to walk out. Considering this, O\u2019Brien stutters, and I tell him I hadn\u2019t meant to trivialise the story. \u201cNo,\u201d he says finally, \u201cit was actually ... thank you for saying that, because it was when I was very depressed.\u201d His four-day lapse had followed the notoriously tense OK Computer tour. \u201cOne of my roles was always to be there for Thom,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause if he couldn\u2019t get through it then none of us could. So I tended to put my own situation on the back burner. When I got back, I did the classic thing: I drank stupidly.\u201d O\u2019Brien quit drinking in 2000, then began \u201cculling\u201d bad influences. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a big social life, Radiohead, so there weren\u2019t many friends to jettison,\u201d he says with another vague laugh. More troubles snowballed. As Yorke and Greenwood toiled with electronics for Kid A, he succumbed to a \u201ccreative paralysis\u201d that \u201cscared the living daylights out of me. When you see Thom come up with Everything in Its Right Place, playing on his Prophet [synth], you go: \u2018Oh my God, can I do anything that will complement this?\u2019 I\u2019d brush it off with humour but inwardly, I was like: \u2018I\u2019m going to be found out.\u2019\u2019\u201d The Brazilian healing experience set him back on course. He took up yoga and attended protests for the first time since university. In 2018, when Extinction Rebellion formed, he became an informal patron. (Radiohead raised roughly \u00a3500,000 for the organisation last year.) Citing its decentralised leadership and \u201cpan-generational\u201d appeal, he broadly considers XR \u201cincredibly enlightened. There have been a few renegade issues, but as Naomi Klein says: \u2018Activism is messy.\u2019 At 51, I\u2019m more like a teenager in my idealism than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d As he fights his coronavirus symptoms, he wonders if there might be an environmental legacy from the outbreak. \u201cIf you look at history, it\u2019s calamities that awaken us to what\u2019s important,\u201d he says. \u201cWho\u2019s gonna win the Premier League is no longer an issue, and that comes from a football fan. I always think about the second world war, the way the country mobilised behind one thing, defeating Nazism. I\u2019ve always felt that the climate emergency will force that upon us. And unfortunately, I think that humanity has only really learned from disaster.\u201d He returned to Brazil with his family in 2012, this time for a year. He told his Radiohead bandmates: \u201cIf you\u2019re in the creative flow, carry on without me,\u201d maybe sensing that, on his family\u2019s quiet Brazilian farm, he would begin noodling towards his solo LP. Doubts persisted, however. One evening after a Radiohead tour, O\u2019Brien revisited his half-finished album and panicked. \u201cYou fucking idiot,\u201d he remembers thinking. \u201cYou wasted all these people\u2019s time.\u201d An overreaction, but a motivating one. \u201cMy mantra became: What is your truth? What do you really feel?\u2019 When I found that, everything else went out the window: \u2018I don\u2019t care that you don\u2019t like this, Flood!\u2019\u201d I remind him of a 2001 radio phone-in where a fan asked if he would ever sing lead vocals on a Radiohead song. He laughed it off then (\u201cI bloody hope not\u201d) and, another time, joked that an Ed O\u2019Brien record would be \u201cethereal music\u201d for stoners. \u201cThe person who said that had a lot of fear,\u201d he says today. \u201cThe band [has] a tough love thing, which is great. But sometimes you need an arm put around you.\u201d O\u2019Brien owes the best part of his life to the group, but creating a world without rules, in his own image, has sparked something uncontainable. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t end when you leave the studio,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe knock-on effect is like a wildfire. You finish recording and it\u2019s roaring through your life.\u201d \u2022 Earth by EOB is released on 17 April on Capitol Records"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
