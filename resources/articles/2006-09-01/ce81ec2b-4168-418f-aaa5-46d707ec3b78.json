She feels that a motorbike is too dangerous and a car is too stuffy, so her plan is hire an auto rickshaw instead. Trouble is, she can't find anywhere on the net that hires them. Can I help? Not exactly, Michelle, but I know where to ask, especially as it gives me the opportunity to check out Yahoo Answers, the new service that allows you to ask for advice or pose questions, travel related or otherwise. So, I placed the question: \"Where can I hire an auto-rickshaw in Kerala\" on a number of travel forums, as well as on answers.yahoo.com. The fullest response, with seven replies, came from a specialist forum indiamike.com (see tinyurl.com/enfd6). Second came Lonely Planet's Thorntree with six (tinyurl.com/j5gdz), then virtualtourist.com with a solitary answer. Yahoo! got none, though it is still early days. The consensus on hiring an auto-rickshaw was: you can, but don't, it's too dangerous. But if it's inspiration you're after try the site of the three American brothers (eagarbros.com/india.htm) who travelled thousands of miles across India by auto rickshaw and lived to tell the tale with eloquence. sean.dodson@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
