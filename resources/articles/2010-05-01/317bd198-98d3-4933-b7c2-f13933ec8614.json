Universities need to meet the aspirations of the increasing numbers of prospective students that wish to attend university. Imposing a higher burden of debt on recent graduates will not only discourage many students from attending university but could prevent many graduates from achieving their ambitions due to the short-term impact of higher debt repayments, potentially creating a \"timebomb\" for vocational professions in the years to come. Universities need to be more entrepreneurial in their approach to funding by working in partnership with business and industry to find solutions to the issues they face. Higher education cannot afford to sit in isolation from industry and, by working more closely with it, we can increase the relevance of universities to businesses in the UK. This will also ensure that the skills of graduates are aligned with the changing needs of industry and will open up participation without putting a greater burden on those that can least afford it.
