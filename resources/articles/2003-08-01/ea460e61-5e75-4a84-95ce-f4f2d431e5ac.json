Yugovich also admitted using spurs with nails attached and an electrified whip during races at the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Racing Club, about 400 miles east of Perth. Announcing the ban yesterday, the Western Australian Turf Club said that Yugovich's offences had taken place between June 2002 and July 2003. The jockey pleaded guilty to five charges, including the use of an electrified whip on a horse called Melody Girl in a maiden race at Kalgoorlie on June 1 last year. The filly, who started at 20-1, finished third of the six runners. Yugovich also admitted possession of an electrified device known as a \"battery\" or \"joint\" and to using a whip with a nail fixed to each side of the handle. His 15-year suspension is almost without precedent in the major racing nations, although Dermot Browne, a former jockey and trainer, was banned for 20 years by the British authorities last year after admitting his role in a series of dopings in 1990. Two years ago Yugovich was one of the most promising young riders in Western Australia and was awarded a scholarship to encourage his devel- opment. However, within days of Melody Girl's race last year he was banned for two months - reduced to one month on appeal - after a fight with another rider in the jockeys' room. He rode his last winner before his latest ban at Port Hedland on July 19. The Kalgoorlie track is a remote outpost of Australian racing but it is still suprising that Yugovich was able to use illegal equipment over the 13-month period, during which he rode 12 winners. The Jockey Club, though, is confident that no rider in Britain could use a battery or illegal whip without being swiftly detected. \"The clerk of the scales at every course has a whip template in front of them to check whips,\" Peter Webbon, the Jockey Club's chief veterinary adviser, said yesterday. \"An electrified whip would be pretty obvious as non-standard. It is almost inconceivable that you could have one that complied with our specifications.\" There are also vets on hand at every British meeting to check on horses and equipment before and after a race. \"All of those things would undoubtedly leave bleeding marks on a horse,\" Webbon said. It is also possible that Yugovich, despite his efforts, did nothing to improve the performance of his horses. \"I've never subscribed to the view that you can make a horse run faster by hurting it,\" Webbon said. \"The average racehorse goes as fast as it can and using these things would sour them very quickly.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
