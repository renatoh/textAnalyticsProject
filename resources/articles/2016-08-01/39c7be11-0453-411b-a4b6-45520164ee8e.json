He turned to his mother and in excited tones inquired: \u201cIs this the very first corn wall?\u201d She replied: \u201cDon\u2019t be silly\u201d and walked on ahead of him, inattentive to the joy evaporating from his face and not noticing the sadness moving across mine. There is a more damaging phrase than \u201cbe a man\u201d (\u201cBoys don\u2019t cry\u201d, Magazinek) and it is this instruction not to play with words and ideas, snuffing out the fire of fun and imagination, and I hazard capturing the worldview of the tedious, target-led education ministers of recent years in their striving for a soulless future for our children, irrespective of gender. Alan Coombe Independent adviser on child protection and early years London NW8 Save our souls I am a poor supporter of the C of E. I was christened a Methodist and hardly ever go to church. Despite that, I am appalled by the prospect, covered in chilling detail by your article \u201cIs this a new crisis of faith?\u201d (News), that the Anglican church is being entrusted to the evangelicals. The panel describes \u201cthe authority of the Bible as paramount\u201d for evangelicals and yet Ric Thorpe, \u201cchurch-planting\u201d bishop of Islington, is quoted at the end of the piece saying: \u201cIf you\u2019re stuck in the past, you will decline because you\u2019re locking yourself into a certain way of doing things and everyone else moves on.\u201d It is a long time since I studied theology but I recall that the Gospels, some of the \u201cnewest\u201d parts of the New Testament, were written about 150 years after the death of Christ. If their authority is paramount to evangelicals, in a fundamentalist way, who is actually \u201cliving in the past\u201d here ? Ben Entwistle Crewe Cheshire How to scalp the touts Secondary theatre ticket sellers are nothing but criminals when asking more than \u00a38,000 for the Harry Potter play (\u201cWhat sorcery is this? A \u00a3140 ticket for new Harry Potter play now costs \u00a38,327\u201d, News). When I buy my train tickets online from Great Western I collect them from a machine that requires me not only to insert the credit card I paid with but also to type the alpha-numeric code my purchase generated. I believe the Odeon also requires my payment card before releasing tickets. Theatres (and music venues suffering this plague) can eliminate extortionists at a stroke by emulating train companies and cinemas. Rob Harris Westbury-on-Severn Gloucestershire We can\u2019t all graduate on top As a retired lecturer, your headline \u201cQuarter of UK graduates are low earners 10 years after university\u201d (News) comes as no surprise to me. When I was first appointed, the university offered a \u201cspecialist\u201d management degree that was accepted as the best in the country. We had amazing students who could command huge salaries in their placement year. Then we were encouraged to increase numbers and offered \u201cgeneral\u201d management courses. The quality of the intake declined and some ended up with only unpaid work-experience in their placement year. It is simple mathematics \u2013 the current graduate population is significantly greater than the number of decent jobs. It is only worthwhile going to university if you have genuine academic ability and are offered a place from a \u201ctop 10\u201d institution; otherwise, you\u2019ll be better off getting a job where you start at the bottom and work your way up. Malcolm Howard Banstead Surrey An easy fix for the iPlayer Why does the BBC need to snoop on people using the iPlayer (John Naughton, New Review)? Why doesn\u2019t Aunty do what Sky does and require users to log into an account before allowing them to stream programmes. If you haven\u2019t got a licence then you can\u2019t log in \u2013 what\u2019s so difficult about that? Sky Go has been doing this for years. Also, it could then permit licence payers to view iPlayer when out of the UK. Ed Marshall Scrooby Notts Wrong track, Mr Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn is wrong to suggest that Virgin Trains is paying less to taxpayers than the state-owned operator (directly operated railways) that previously ran the east coast franchise (interview, News). In fact, we will pay significantly more to the Treasury: \u00a33.3bn over the eight years of our franchise, compared to \u00a31bn paid over five years by DOR. And our plans will benefit customers as well as taxpayers. Since taking over the route in 2015, we have embarked on a \u00a3140m programme of investment and in two years will introduce our brand new fleet of Azuma trains to the route, allowing us to accelerate journeys and increase seating capacity from King\u2019s Cross by 28% during the peak period.
