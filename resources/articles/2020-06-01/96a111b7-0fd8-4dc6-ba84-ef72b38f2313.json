Authorities in the southern California city vowed on Friday to investigate the death of Robert Fuller, after the Los Angeles county medical examiner deferred an earlier decision labeling the cause of death as suicide pending a full autopsy. Community members had confronted city officials at a contentious news briefing Friday, asking why they were quick to label Fuller\u2019s death on Wednesday a suicide and demanding an independent autopsy. On Saturday, protesters marched from the park where Fuller was found to the Los Angeles county sheriff\u2019s station, demanding a full investigation into the man\u2019s death. Many carried signs that said \u201cJustice for Robert Fuller\u201d. Fuller\u2019s sister addressed the crowd near Palmdale\u2019s city hall. \u201cWe want to find out the truth on what really happened,\u201d Diamond Alexander said, according to the LATimes. \u201cWe just want the truth. My brother was not suicidal. He was a survivor. He was street smart.\u201d Sheriff\u2019s Capt Ron Shaffer said homicide detectives were investigating the circumstances leading to Fuller\u2019s death to determine if foul play was involved. Investigators have been in contact with Fuller\u2019s family, Palmdale officials said. The city said there were no outdoor cameras that could have recorded what happened.
