The honours system is clearly flawed and the prime minister should take steps to remove honours from people who bring their office into disrepute.\u201d The MP\u2019s comments follow those of the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who also called for Green to lose his knighthood after the businessman\u2019s decision to drop a legal case against the Daily Telegraph, which had been investigating claims he had harassed staff and used non-disclosure agreements to pay them off and secure their silence. It has also been suggested that the corporate culture over which Green presided was a continued cause for concern even after several aggrieved employees had received the pay-offs. Peter Hain, the Labour peer who last year used parliamentary privilege to name Green as the businessman who had been accused of sexual and racial harassment, said his decision to speak out had come after being approached by a person \u201cintimately involved\u201d in the case because he \u201chad been known to speak up for human rights from my anti-apartheid days\u201d. \u201cTheir motive was that nothing had really changed [after the pay-offs had been agreed] and that the alleged behaviour was continuing \u2013 that was another factor motivating me,\u201d Hain said. \u201cYou could tell just discussing it with them, the feeling of anger that whatever that person did, whatever steps he or she took to gain redress, they didn\u2019t get anywhere.\u201d When the claim was put to him yesterday, Green declined to comment. In the past he has always denied any claims of sexual and racial harassment. Hain\u2019s decision last October to stand up in the House of Lords and identify Green as the businessman at the centre of allegations being investigated by the Telegraph ignited a ferocious legal battle which ended on Friday when the magnate, who with his wife, Tina, is worth some \u00a32bn, abandoned his court action preventing the newspaper from reporting some of the allegations against him. The Telegraph said the Arcadia boss, whose brands include Topshop and Miss Selfridge, had paid out millions of pounds in settlements to staff members who include a senior female executive who Green allegedly called a \u201cnaughty girl\u201d. The newspaper said he allegedly kissed her face on a number of occasions, slapped her behind and commented on her weight. According to the Telegraph, Green also allegedly drew attention to the dreadlocks of a black male employee in front of other staff, and referred to him \u201cthrowing spears in the jungle\u201d. Lawyers for Green told the Telegraph that it was \u201cdenied that any of Sir Philip\u2019s conduct towards employees amounted to any type of crime, or anything that would amount to gross misconduct, or a serious risk to health and safety\u201d. The use of non disclosure agreements now faces calls for reform as a result of the case. \u201cNDAs should never be used to suppress allegations of criminal behaviour so the next Labour government will review the statute book to ensure that the law protects the voices of survivors,\u201d Lavery said. Late on Saturday the Telegraph published further revelations and said its investigation showed \u201cwitness testimonies were left out of a report into sexual harassment.\u201d It said Arcadia group was \u201cfacing accusations of a cover-up\u201d as a result."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
