You\u2019ve got to respect what the Golden State Warriors have done.\u201d The parallels between the USWNT and the other sports dynasties that neutrals love to hate are obvious. No other team has won more World Cups and Olympic gold medals than the US, who have been ranked No 1 in the world since lifting the Women\u2019s World Cup trophy in 2015. And after thumping Thailand 13-0 on Tuesday without showing mercy \u2013 neither in the volume of goals nor in the jubilant celebrations \u2013 the Americans only offered more fuel for the unaffiliated to root against. That doesn\u2019t worry USWNT players, though. It\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re a frontrunner, just as is the case for Patriots and the others. \u201cWe always have a target on our backs, but why wouldn\u2019t you want that?\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cThe No 1 team in the world, we won the last World Cup and we\u2019re trying win this World Cup again. It\u2019s great when there\u2019s a target on your back, when people are talking about you \u2013 you\u2019re obviously doing something right.\u201d The USA\u2019s record-setting demolition of Thailand offered fodder for a match-up that on paper figured to be a run-of-the-mill US win. Debates broke out on social media and in comments sections all over the internet as to whether the Americans should\u2019ve kept celebrating after, say, the sixth goal they scored in the rout. But the players probably haven\u2019t seen much of the reaction, if any of it, other than the questions they\u2019ve faced from the press corps following the match, of course. During events like the World Cup, the players live inside what they refer to as their \u201cbubble\u201d. They stay off social media, don\u2019t read the news, and interactions with the press come in tightly controlled situations. The players focus on soccer, they focus on their relationships with each other, and they let everything else fade into the background. So when asked about Hope Solo\u2019s controversial comments last week calling Jill Ellis a poor leader, the players told the reporter they hadn\u2019t seen what she said and couldn\u2019t comment. Again, when asked about the hand-wringing about the goal celebrations against Thailand, a similar answer followed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we as a team are super involved in watching or reading a lot of media about ourselves, to be honest,\u201d midfielder Samantha Mewis said when asked about the criticism of the team\u2019s celebrations. \u201cWe had heard there were some things going on, but I think we\u2019re just trying to focus on the next game against Chile.\u201d Younger players like attackers Mallory Pugh and Rose Lavelle, who are competing in their first World Cup, have opted to remove social media from their devices altogether. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been deleting social media every camp since last year because I knew it was something that, if I didn\u2019t start to wean off it, it could negatively affect me in this tournament,\u201d Lavelle said. \u201cNo offense to you guys, you\u2019re all great. I\u2019m really happy I did that because I feel like I can stay more focused and be more present with the team.\u201d For veterans like Lloyd, it\u2019s a bit less of a bunker mentality. \u201cI\u2019m a lot older. I don\u2019t really care what people think,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cA lot of these people think that they\u2019re experts and they\u2019re not \u2013 no disrespect.\u201d She does have her agent and publicist post on her behalf during the World Cup, but she says she\u2019s the one who noticed the tweet from Thailand\u2019s goalkeeper, Sukanya Chor Charoenying, thanking Lloyd for kind words after the match. \u201cI\u2019m happy I saw that,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cIf I was blacked out and not on Twitter, it would\u2019ve gone unnoticed.\u201d The so-called \u201cbubble\u201d may offer an easy out for the players throughout the World Cup: anytime they are asked about a controversy, they can claim ignorance on the topic. But it\u2019s clearly something that works for them. Back in 2015, the USWNT was hit with plenty of flak for a lackluster start to the World Cup, and even former team legend Michelle Akers had publicly criticized Ellis. But Ellis and the players insisted they weren\u2019t paying attention. The term \u201cbubble\u201d was used over and over again. Ultimately, the US lifted the trophy. So what is it about the bubble that works? It\u2019s not so much about us on the outside: it\u2019s about the players connecting with each other. \u201cThe best way to come together as a group is to create that bubble and eliminate all the outside noise,\u201d goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher said last week. \u201cWe have all those expectations for ourselves. We don\u2019t need any outside things. We have high standards. We want to win. \u201cThe more that we can bond and come together as a group, you\u2019ll be able to see that on the field. I think all that translates into performances. You can see the teams that are cohesive and you can see the teams that aren\u2019t, and we want to be one of those cohesive teams.\u201d The most charitable view of the USWNT\u2019s exuberant goal celebrations against an overmatched Thai team is along those things: that the players wanted to celebrate together and enjoy the moment with one another rather than throw their dominance in the faces of the Thai team. Not everyone will see it that way, of course. Whether it\u2019s the USWNT, the Patriots or the others, some fans will be irked by whatever the Americans do. That\u2019s fine with the USWNT: they\u2019re used to it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
