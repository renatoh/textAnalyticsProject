The quality of rugby in the league has been much derided in recent years, usually by people who do not watch much of it. Here was the latest submission in defence of a competition that gets better by the year. It has always been a ferociously competitive affair. Even so, this is the most competitive yet, with eight teams theoretically in with a play-off chance and two weekends to go. Bath kept up their chase by managing to hold off a furious Worcester assault in the dying moments of this match, thereby keeping hold of second place for their considerable pains. If Bath were nervous about the hordes of recent champions clamouring behind them for one of the two home play-off positions, you would never know it from the way they cut loose from the first whistle. If Worcester had nothing really to play for - their Premiership survival was rubber-stamped yesterday, but it has been assumed for a while now - you would never know it from the way they hammered away to the death for the win. Bath had their first score after seven minutes. Tom Cheeseman got all three of their tries, looping Joe Maddock for that first effort. His second came midway through the first half, after Lee Mears had sent Michael Lipman galloping away from halfway. But his second only reclaimed the lead, because Worcester had replied to Bath's first strike with a penalty and a try of their own, even more brilliantly and outrageously conceived. Marcel Garvey was sent sprinting free from a scrum in their 22. He found Rico Gear and the All Black sent Miles Benjamin off towards Bath's line. A bitterly cold day it may have been, but it was warming to see the players adopt such brisk exercise as the remedy, rather than the all-in huddle we might have expected from these two teams not so long ago. Olly Barkley, Mears, Lipman and Matt Stevens were having a great time galloping round the place, which is good news for whoever is in charge of England these days. But of equal interest to that poor fool some day may be the form of Benjamin, who is making quite a name for himself at Worcester. His try after the break, in defiance of the squadron of tacklers in front of him, rounded off a fine Worcester passage of play and kept the game on a knife-edge, dragging the home side back after Barkley had opened up an eight-point lead with penalties either side of half time. The wind and increasing drizzle were starting to take their toll. Shane Drahm's nothing kick should never have led to anything as valuable as the lead, but neither of the Michaels, Stephenson and Claassens, saw fit to deal with it, and Drahm could not believe his luck as he regathered, to make it 20-16 to the Warriors. Bath's deteriorating brilliance held good for one last flourish. Cheeseman (Welsh, in case anyone at Twickenham was wondering - but perhaps young enough to be corrupted) rounded off a slick backline move from a line-out for his hat-trick, which Barkley converted from the touchline. After that, though, it was heads down as Worcester came at them as if they, too, were after a place in the play-offs. They are still after a place in the Heineken Cup, though, which would be theirs if they win the Challenge Cup. They could even meet Bath in the final. It may not be the Premiership, but get along and see it if they do.
