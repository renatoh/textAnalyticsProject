It took an own-goal to set them on their way after a lacklustre performance, yet Walter Smith will be relieved Rangers avoided the kind of struggles they have endured against lower league opposition in recent times. Forfar Athletic will host Smith's men in the fifth round, by which time it remains open to conjecture which high-profile players will still don blue. At least one of them, it seems, will have been sold. \"It is our job to be ready to play games of football,\" said Rangers' assistant manager, Ally McCoist, of speculation regarding the club's finances. \"Nothing can distract us from that. We have had no problems at all as a group of staff and players.\" Stuart McCaffrey will be credited with the aberration which gave Rangers their first-half lead but it was the St Johnstone goalkeeper, Alan Main, who was at fault at the time of the goal. Main's opposite number, Allan McGregor, enhanced his stock with two superb saves. If Kris Boyd had been the name on everyone's lips in advance of this tie, he was soon replaced as the topic of conversation by Sir David Murray, the Rangers chairman. Murray's willingness to sell Boyd to Birmingham City \u2014 a deal which remains in limbo \u2014 has upset his club's supporters. Murray made a rare appearance for an away fixture here and was met with a banner suggesting he \"Must Go\". \"All we ask for is the fans' continued support,\" said McCoist afterwards. St Johnstone sought to compound Murray's unhappiness. Andy Jackson had two attempts brilliantly saved by McGregor as Rangers toiled. Luck subsequently smiled on the visitors. With Main woefully out of position and shanking an attempted clearance, Boyd's cross was prodded into his own net by McCaffrey. Completely against the run of play Rangers had been afforded a half-time lead. The hosts appeared fatally wounded after the goal and offered little attacking threat thereafter. Nacho Novo sealed the tie 11 minutes from time, rounding off one of several swift counter-attacks by slotting Steven Davis's cross home from eight yards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
