You take a few weeks off after the season ends and before you know it you arrive in January with a beer belly and a daunting road back to full fitness. The aim of these monthly guides is to make sure this doesn't happen to you. To recap, last month I talked about October being the month to ease back into your training and suggested that everything you do should be under 80% of your maximum heart rate. That doesn't sound a lot, but the idea is to slowly build your fitness throughout the winter so that in six months' time you'll have one hell of an engine which can be fine-tuned before the season starts. This is a principle that carries over to this month - however you will also devote a lot of time to technique. It's not the sexiest of subjects, but the more efficient you are in the swim, bike and run, the faster you will be able to race, so it's an essential part of your winter training. So, let's talk November. On the top of my notes to my athletes, I always write 'Remember, remember, we start in November'. This month should be your restart - but it will be a very easy one, with plenty of room for manoeuvre in your sessions. For a long bicycle ride, for instance, I suggest 'a one to two hour session' - and let my athletes make their own choice. In season they are probably riding three hours. Again on the run, instead of 90 minutes, as they would do in the season, they will do between 30-60 minutes. So I bringing them back slowly in all disciplines - this month I don't want my athletes working to more than 85% of their heart rate, and for most of the time it will be less than that. Because I'm bringing my athletes back slowly, I find that November is a brilliant month to spend a lot of time on technique. Of course we incorporate technical drills into our routines throughout the year, but because you're not busting a gut in every session you can concentrate on becoming more efficient in your swim, bike and run. There are several different ways to improve technique, and I'd advise anyone who is serious about improving to join a club or get a coach. In November I set one session per discipline a week on drills and skills, which is pretty typical. On a bike turbo session, for example, I usually stress two elements: single-leg and spin ups. By working one leg, we can overload it and make it stronger, but we can also get the technique right by working in a big gear. On spin-ups we increase the cadence to maybe 130-140 rpm - a purely neural, not muscular move. One of my sessions this month goes back and forth from single leg to spinning, spinning to single leg. The whole routine is made up that way. How can you incorporate drills into running? During this time of year, if I have a run of 30-60 minutes I will split it into three and in the middle section I will put in strides. I usually have some fast feet and strides in there too. Once I've got those I can pop those into the long run or some of the treadmill work that we do. Mentally working on technique breaks things up. It is also exceptionally mental because you have to think about what you're doing. On the turbo session, for instance, I actually set my athletes a session where they close their eyes while they are spinning so they can feel what they are doing. That way, it actually becomes more ingrained in their heads. They can feel it. But most important of all, improving your technique makes you more efficient. It means you have to work less hard to do the same level of work. Take it from me: work on your drills and skills now, and you'll be looking at faster times in the summer.
