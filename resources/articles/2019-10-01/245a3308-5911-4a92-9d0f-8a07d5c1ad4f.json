Williamson, whose side endured the gut-wrenching super\u2011over defeat against Eoin Morgan\u2019s England team in the summer\u2019s World Cup final, has withdrawn from the five-match T20 series that begins on 1 November in Christchurch. No return date has been given for the 32-year-old right-hander \u2013 supporters will hope he is fit for the two\u2011match Test series that starts in Mount Maunganui on 21 November \u2013 and the seamer Tim Southee will now captain in his absence. New Zealand, who named a 14-man T20 squad, said a long-term hip problem had resurfaced after Williamson turned out for Northern Districts in the opening round of Plunket Shield fixtures. \u201cWe\u2019ve been monitoring the injury for a while now and it\u2019s the same issue that ruled him out of the final Test against Bangladesh in March,\u201d said Gary Stead, the New Zealand coach. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing timing for Kane at the start of an exciting Kiwi summer but we feel it\u2019s the right decision with a busy season ahead.\u201d England, resting a host of first-team regulars for the white-ball series as they look to blood fresh talent before next year\u2019s T20 World Cup, are freshly arrived in New Zealand and have named Kent\u2019s Sam Billings as Morgan\u2019s vice-captain. The tourists begin with two warm\u2011up games in Lincoln on Sunday and Tuesday. Lockie Ferguson, the 90mph fast bowler who lit up the World Cup with 21 wickets, is part of a greenhorn New Zealand board XI as he returns from a broken thumb. Ferguson is also down to face England in the series proper before making way for Trent Boult after the first three matches. The series opener at Hagley Oval has been announced as a fundraiser for the victims of the Christchurch terror attacks in March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
