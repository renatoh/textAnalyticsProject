But the lasting impression of the chancellor's visit to Rio de Janeiro and Bras\u00edlia, as he flew to Washington on Wednesday night for a meeting of the IMF, was not of warm memories of his gap year. It was, instead, the unmistakable sign of his iron grip back home on the government and his hold over David Cameron in a moment of crisis. \"This was George's reshuffle \u2013 once again,\" one knowledgeable and experienced Tory remarked. \"He always makes sure that, at moments like this, his people are summoned.\" The clear hand of Osborne in the reshuffle was demonstrated by the appointment of his former parliamentary aide Sajid Javid as the first member of the 2010 intake to the cabinet as culture secretary. Osborne soon spotted the former banker after his election as MP for Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, and made him his parliamentary private secretary the following year. But the real sign of Osborne's influence came not so much with the appointment of Javid, who had been widely tipped as the next cabinet entrant. It was the promotion of Nicky Morgan as Javid's replacement as financial secretary to the Treasury \u2013 with the added portfolio of minister for women with a non-voting seat at the cabinet table \u2013 that showed his power. Morgan, 41, also elected in 2010, had been overlooked as greater bets were placed on Esther McVey and Elizabeth Truss as the next women to join the cabinet. But in private Osborne has been letting friends know he has been deeply impressed by Morgan. \"George really feels comfortable with Nicky,\" one friend said. Another said: \"Oh yes, Nicky has impressed Osborne in recent months.\" The final ministerial appointment of the day \u2013 the promotion of Andrea Leadsom from the Downing Street policy board to replace Morgan as economic secretary to the Treasury \u2013 was the most intriguing. Leadsom, a former director of the investment bank BZW, is one of the most talented members of the 2010 intake with interests ranging from a highly technical understanding of the EU to a deeply personal commitment to early childhood intervention. In recent weeks Osborne was suggesting in private that he was still troubled by Leadsom's decision in 2012 to call on him to apologise to Ed Balls for his attempts to link the shadow chancellor to the Libor-fixing scandal. But Osborne was beginning to indicate that it would be foolish to deny such a talented politician a break when the Tory benches are not overburdened with A-league politicians. \"The appointment of Andrea shows George is not at all tribal,\" one friend said. \"It shows that all he cares about is hiring the best talent.\" Osborne also played an important role in the resignation of Miller, it became clear as intriguing details emerged of a different emphasis between the chancellor and prime minister. David Cameron, who hates to be bounced into a reshuffle, was keen to allow Miller to hang on because she had been cleared of the main complaint against her over her expenses. Osborne, on the other hand, was clear that Miller was damaged goods. Speaking before her resignation, one friend said: \"Maria Miller has not handled herself brilliantly. You can't sack her now but you could sack her in the next reshuffle.\" The chancellor, who hires people on merit rather than on whether they are regular members of his dinner party circle, takes a clinical view of politics. A tarnished politician damages the team and will eventually have to be despatched. Cameron, on the other hand, sets great store by personal loyalty and hates having to remove people. But the Osborne camp were clear that Miller had to go. One Tory said: \"Maria has given a textbook example of how not to handle a crisis. At every stage she made the wrong call \u2013 she made a complete pig's ear of it.\" As one of the most socially liberal MPs at Westminster, Osborne strongly agrees with Miller's greatest achievement \u2013 the introduction of gay marriage. But that did not stop the chancellor thinking she was out of her depth in the cabinet. \"Maria rose too quickly from minister for disabled people to the cabinet,\" one Tory said. \"She didn't really have enough to build up relationships. So when she ran into trouble there was nothing in the bank. Maria was not comfortable in her department. She did not look like she commanded it.\" Osborne will \u2013 publicly at least \u2013 loathe the talk about his dominant role in the reshuffle. But his critics are warning that the Osborne share price can occasionally rise too high. \"Let's not forget George was responsible for promoting Chloe Smith,\" one Tory said of the former Treasury minister whose frontbench career ended after she was eaten alive on Newsnight by Jeremy Paxman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
