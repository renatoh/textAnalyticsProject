England had reached seven without loss after being put in to bat, but both Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards had to abort their run-ups several times and play was finally abandoned after extensive discussions between the match referee, Alan Hurst, the umpires Daryl Harper and Tony Hill, and both captains. \"It is a health hazard for the players,\" said Hurst. \"Play has been abandoned for the day as the ground is unfit. I don't think there was any doubt there was a problem before we came here with the sand on the ground but everyone thought it was OK. No one had bowled on the wicket to test it out. It would have been jumping the gun to say it was unfit before the start of play. In the long run we have to look at the health and safety of the players.\" While members of the groundstaff set about digging up the sand with a possible view to replacing it with turf brought in from a nearby golf course, Hurst and other members of the International Cricket Council headed into the Antiguan capital of St John's to check conditions at the Recreation Ground, following a request from the England and Wales Cricket Board to play the game there. The England captain, Andrew Strauss, said he would be happy to play the match at a venue where Brian Lara scored 375 against England in 1993-94 and 400 not out a decade later, even though there are concerns about the safety of the main stand. The ARG hasn't staged a Test match since June 2006 and has been used most recently for football. Because of the problem of relocating equipment at short notice, the referral system will not be used. Hugh Morris, the managing director of the England team, said he had written a letter to Hurst on the eve of the match detailing his concerns with the state of the outfield at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, which had only previously staged one Test, against Australia last year. Morris added: \"To have a day of Test match cricket abandoned is clearly not good enough and everyone must recognise that because it doesn't do the image of cricket any good around the world.\" Strauss, who was on six not out at the time of abandonment, believes his players would stand less chance of getting injured at the ARG, but admitted conditions at the proposed alternative venue were far from ideal. \"It's not in a great state but in terms of injuries or whatever it is fit to play on,\" he said. \"We don't know what state the wicket is in. It might not have been covered all night but I think it's fit for bowlers to bowl on and batsmen to play on.\" Meanwhile, Haroon Lorgat, the chief executive of the ICC, placed the blame on the West Indies Cricket Board, but stressed that the game's governing body wanted to see the game staged in Antigua, rather than move it to Barbados, where what has now become the fourth Test is scheduled to start on February 26. \"It's clearly the West Indies Cricket Board's [responsibility],\" he said. \"It is their responsibility to ensure that the ground is fit for play, that it meets the minimum standards for Test match cricket. They are trying to do everything possible to fix the problem, as difficult as that is going to be, and are accepting of their responsibility. \"It's not good enough. We have to make sure in the future we try and avoid it. Between the groundsman, between the match officials, they are going to have to make a very, very careful assessment and their judgment is going to have to be spot on this time.\" The West Indies captain, Chris Gayle, said: \"It's definitely embarrassing. I apologise to the spectators as well - it's a huge turnout and everybody wants to see cricket. It's really disappointing to see these things happen. I am not surprised about the conditions because when we were doing some fielding drills it wasn't suitable at all. It was really disappointing.\" But Gayle was pessimistic about the state of the pitch at the Recreation Ground. \"We practised there but take into consideration the field wasn't up to standard there as well,\" he said. \"It was a bit bumpy - I gather there's a lot of football played there. The field is a bit bumpy, even the wicket has a couple of ridges so you have some uneven bounce.\" The embarrassment brought back memories of the first Test between West Indies and England at Sabina Park in Jamaica in 1997-98, which was abandoned on the first day due to a dangerous pitch. Two Tests were then played in Trinidad to make up for the one that was lost. West Indies lead the current series 1-0."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
