The six men and six women had been deliberating for six days. Today, the judge Mrs Justice Rafferty discharged them after being told they were unable to reach a verdict on which at least ten of the 12 jurors could agree. Last Friday, the judge gave them a majority instruction which meant it was not necessary for them to reach a unanimous verdict, but they were still unable to reach a verdict. Nicholas Hilliard, prosecuting, told the judge the crown wanted Jenkins, 47, to face trial again. Jenkins, dressed in a blue denim shirt and light coloured trousers, was remanded on bail. After leaving the dock, Jenkins spoke to his new wife, Christina, who had been sitting at the back of the court. A further hearing is due to take place in the future to fix a date for the third trial. The former deputy headteacher, of Belgravia, central London, denies murdering his 13-year-old foster daughter Billie-Jo in February 1997. She was bludgeoned to death with a metal tent peg as she painted patio doors at the family's home in Hastings, East Sussex. Jenkins was jailed for life in 1998 but has been on bail for a year since he was released by the appeal court last year, pending the retrial. He continued to plead his innocence in the 11-week retrial, saying Billie-Jo was alive when he left the house. The trial has seen his former wife, Lois Jenkins, speculating that he may have killed Billie-Jo because she was \"winding up\" his blood daughter Annie. But Jenkins also gave evidence that Billie-Jo was \"delightfully happy\" when he last saw her, and that his marriage had fallen apart when he lost Lois Jenkins' trust after being accused of the murder. During the trial he was taken with the jury to the three-storey, semi-detached house where Billie-Jo was killed. It is understood that it was the first time Jenkins had returned to the house since he was charged with the murder in March 1997."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
