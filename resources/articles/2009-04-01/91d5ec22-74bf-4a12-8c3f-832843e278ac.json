That effort is paying off now.\" Bruised and battered, Arsenal's wounded rearguard have become the latest victims of a forward back to his irrepressible best. Juventus and Liverpool have been brutally barged from contests by the Ivorian in recent weeks, with London rivals now dispatched the same way. Barcelona are braced to receive him in the weeks to come as a season that two months ago had been notable only for his marginalisation from the first team, now threatens glorious reward. Drogba is revived and leaving his markers gasping for breath. The sudden transformation in the forward's fortunes represents the most staggering turnaround and potentially the key legacy of Guus Hiddink's brief involvement at Stamford Bridge. Back in the dark days, watching as an outcast as Luiz Felipe Scolari's selection won a third round replay against Southend in January, Drogba might never have envisaged scarring opponents such as Arsenal in a game of this importance ever again. He had been cast to the fringes at Root's Hall, an anaemic display in heavy defeat at Manchester United three days earlier having convinced Scolari that the Ivorian lacked the focus as well as the fitness to merit inclusion even in his flailing side. Hiddink was in place a month later and found a player shorn of conviction and dismayed by the perceived lack of faith he had been afforded by the previous regime. \"He is training hard now with a smile on his face,\" said the Dutchman. \"We had a good talk that first week and he, like everyone, reacted. He's delivering now. He's physically strong and brave. He goes into duels not knowing what's happening behind his back. When you play him it hurts.\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is still riled by the African's tendency to crumple too easily, though he conceded that the scourge of his centre-halves was \"a killer\". The Chelsea striker's sense of timing seems to puncture Arsenal's resilience. Kolo Tour\u00e9 was the only surviving member of his team's back-line from the Carling Cup final two years ago when Drogba scored twice to overhaul an early Theo Walcott goal. This contest almost went the same way, Drogba's reward coming six minutes from the end when, profiting from Frank Lampard's wonderful pass and Lukasz Fabianski's latest horrific rush of blood, he thumped into an unguarded net. He had almost scored from a similar mistake \u2013 and with a header \u2013 in the opening four minutes and where Philippe Senderos had been reduced to rubble at the Millennium stadium, so Mika\u00ebl Silvestre wilted here. The Frenchman might have conceded a penalty after handling as he failed to cope with Drogba's raw aggression. \"When Didier plays like that he's one of the best in the world,\" said John Terry almost in Silvestre's defence. \"He's unplayable.\" Drogba was, of course, unplayable in another sense earlier in the campaign. His dismissal in last season's Champions League final exposed a player still unsettled by Jose Mourinho's exit. A knee injury had merely denied him an opportunity to make swift amends. The Ivorian has a little over a year remaining on his contract and at times over this campaign some in the hierarchy would not have been upset to have purged Chelsea of his occasionally moody presence, such has been his tempestuous relationship with the club. Yet this was a performance to demand the scheduling of meetings with his representatives to negotiate a contract extension. Carlo Ancelotti is Roman Abramovich's preferred permanent appointment at Stamford Bridge and the Italian has consistently tracked Arsenal's Emmanuel Adebayor as the muscle to lead his forward line, yet there was no comparison between the pair here. The Togolese may be younger and offer plenty for the long term but Chelsea and their managers seem to operate to short-term objectives. Drogba, his game hoisted for the big occasion, is untouchable. He spoke of drawing inspiration from \"Eric Cantona and even Nicolas Anelka scoring at the old Wembley\" in this match, though his season has become a crusade to re-establish his reputation. \"It was difficult watching the Southend game but the players all showed me a lot of respect and support,\" he added. \"They won that game and gave me the chance to be here now. You have to perform in big games, and I love those occasions.\" There will be more to relish in the month ahead. There was such power and experience in Chelsea's ranks that it always felt as if Arsenal's youth and invention might be eclipsed. Florent Malouda's soft equaliser served to turn the tide early and, steadily but inexorably, Hiddink's team eroded their opponents' self-belief. The temporary manager will leave his post with the \"perfect scenario\" of an FA Cup final. His successor may just inherit a world-class striker around whom to prosper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
