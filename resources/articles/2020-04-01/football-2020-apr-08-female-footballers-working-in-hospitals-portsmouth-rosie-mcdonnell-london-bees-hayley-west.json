People are adapting with every day that goes by; more plans come into place, different equipment, different strategies to try and manage the workload. It\u2019s not horrendous at the moment where I am \u2013 I know that ICU [intensive care units] and high\u2011care areas are struggling a lot more \u2013 but there is a bit of a sense that we\u2019re getting ready to deal with a bigger influx of patients, which is a little daunting. But credit to everyone I work with, no one has shied away from work.\u201d Portsmouth\u2019s season has gone, with the National League South voided as a result of the crisis, and McDonnell misses the escape the sport provides. \u201cIt is nice when you\u2019ve had a stressful week you can go to football training and just forget about it for a couple of hours,\u201d she says. But there is a modicum of relief too for McDonnell, who doesn\u2019t have to choose between her two passions. \u201cIt has helped in that sense. I do love playing football but there\u2019s more important things in life. I look forward to getting back into it but for now it needs to be on the back burner.\u201d The Championship defender Hayley West, who plays for London Bees, is a sports therapist in her final year on a preregistration physiotherapy masters, a two\u2011year accelerated programme, and epitomises the drive that healthcare professionals feel during crisis. Having just completed her fifth of six placements at Whitechapel\u2019s Royal London hospital, she is waiting for the outcome of talks between the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy and the professional council about graduating students early so she can throw herself back into the breach. In the meantime, she is picking up shifts as a rehab support worker with a community physiotherapy team. West saw big changes at the Royal London, where she finished late last month. \u201cThere was training all over the place. You\u2019ve got the intranet which is updated with Covid protocols every single day. There is an office which is open in the morning for staff members, in the afternoon for students only, and you can go there and ask them anything about Covid.\u201d The physiotherapy team is being brought together and split into two to cope with the changes. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know how many patients are going to end up having it or how many wards are going to be changed from, like, a trauma ward to a high-dependency unit. There\u2019s no point in having the one physio on a trauma ward and all of a sudden they\u2019ve got to deal with high-dependency patients.\u201d For some, sport and coronavirus have been very separate, for others, like McDonnell and West, they are entwined. Although the worlds are very different, there are similarities between the ethos in a football team and the one on a ward. \u201cThere\u2019s not that strong a link between healthcare and football but they are very similar environments,\u201d McDonnell says. \u201cYou have challenges in football, you rise to the big games, you have to do things you wouldn\u2019t normally do to get the team through and it\u2019s the same in healthcare.\u201d West agrees: \u201cOne hundred per cent. Everyone works with everyone, every discipline. At work they are absolutely brilliant. At lunchtime, in the team I\u2019ve just finished with, there was a rule that you don\u2019t talk about Covid over lunch. You\u2019ve got 10 minutes before lunch where you can raise concerns but actually during lunch there\u2019s music played, we all sat two metres apart, which is quite amusing, but you\u2019re there and just chatting and having a nice time.\u201d Both have felt humbled by the support for health workers and the shift in consciousness on who holds value in society. \u201cI finished my shift, and there was the applause at 8pm and it just made everything feel so much more valued,\u201d says McDonnell. \u201cNone of the work has changed, the effort has always been going in, but it\u2019s really lovely to see that appreciated.\u201d West says: \u201cIt\u2019s been a wake-up call. Last week when we stood outside and clapped I actually got really emotional. Because there\u2019s stuff that\u2019s going on behind closed doors that most of the country won\u2019t see but they are recognising and clapping for it. I was clapping for it but I\u2019m a tiny part of a bigger thing. \u201cI\u2019ve had my eyes opened too about shop workers, lorry drivers and stuff. There\u2019s a lot of: \u2018Oh they only work in a shop. Oh they only stack shelves in Tesco.\u2019 When you\u2019re 16 and want a job it is: \u2018Go and work in Tesco, that will be all right.\u2019 Actually, it\u2019s those people right now that\u2019s are keeping the country going. \u201cThey are risking themselves just so we can have food. [Then there are] the people that are volunteering; every family member helping out. It\u2019s insane and great. I don\u2019t know if you can really put the NHS on top of everyone else. The NHS might be saving lives but the shopworkers are too.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
