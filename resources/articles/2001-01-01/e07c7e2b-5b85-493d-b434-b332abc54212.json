Given has failed to regain his first-team place from Steve Harper after missing United's Boxing Day win over Leeds with a dead leg. The 24-year-old signed a new four-year contract at St James' Park in September but his inability to win a recall despite last week's 4-2 humbling at Tottenham prompted his request. \"The board have told me that they will give me a decision later in the week and in the meantime I will train with enthusiasm,\" said Given, who was signed for \u00a32.5m in May 1997. \"I thought that my consistency in the 20 or so early-season games would have meant an early recall. When this did not happen and I was given no explanation, I felt I had no other way of making my feelings known. \"There are many players who would not have reacted in this way, but I am a passionate and committed player, desperate for Newcastle to do well.\" If United comply and circulate his name, the Tyneside club will have over \u00a316m of defensive talent available for transfer, including the \u00a33.25m French left-back Didier Domi and the \u00a36m Spanish centre-half Marcelino. Carlisle's former chairman Michael Knighton has denied he still controls the Third Division strugglers via Mamcarr, the Gibraltar-based company which claimed to have bought his controlling interest last week. Rumours abound in Cumbria that Mamcarr, whose directors remain anonymous, is an acronym of Michael And Mark, Chevonne, Albert, Rosemary and Rory - the former owner, his eldest son, daughter, father, wife and younger son. \"That is absolute rubbish,\" said Knighton, who last year was banned from acting as a company director by the Department of Trade and Industry. \"I am not a director of Mamcarr and I have no intention of becoming one. Neither am I the beneficial owner of Mamcarr. I know people are asking whether I am controlling the football club via an offshore vehicle and I can categorically tell you that I am not.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
