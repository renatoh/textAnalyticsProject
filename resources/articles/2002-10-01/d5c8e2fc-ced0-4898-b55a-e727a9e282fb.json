It was a reflection not only of the result but the thought of leaving Slovakia after 24 hours marred by shootings, racism, violence and a dreadful pitch. Steven Gerrard, though, looked in no mood to smile. The Liverpool midfielder is usually willing to share his thoughts after international matches but here he walked by without stopping. Logic suggests his silence sprang in part from his disappointing performance and late substitution but also from worries about where he fits into Sven-Goran Eriksson's plans. Gerrard played the second half against Slovakia on the left after Eriksson made a crucial half-time switch to a midfield diamond which featured Paul Scholes behind the strikers and Nicky Butt in front of the back four. England were so much more lively and cohesive with Scholes in that role rather than on the left that Eriksson ought to stick with the system. The worry for Gerrard is that Butt may have secured a central spot with his impressive World Cup. So where would that leave him? A natural left midfielder he is not. Few would dispute that Gerrard has the talent to start for almost any European nation, poorly though he performed on Saturday when he exemplified England's first-half disease of hitting too many long, inaccurate balls. Having missed the World Cup, he was perhaps guilty of trying to make too much of an impact. The 22-year-old is more gifted than Butt with his range of passing and ability to dominate a match and threaten goal. But Eriksson would show a remarkable lack of loyalty to Butt by dropping him, and he does not have the flexibility to play the Manchester United man on the left. Although England could expect to beat Macedonia on Wednesday with Scholes back out wide, that would achieve little in terms of long-term strategy. Eriksson suggested he would keep Scholes in his favoured central position. \"I've seen Scholes play on the left many times but I guess it was very important to take him more central in the second half,\" he said. \"We could keep the ball much better. We had struggled to do that.\" What Eriksson saw in the first 45 minutes in Slovakia is that throwing together the country's best four midfielders far from guarantees the desired outcome. The coach resembled a chef chucking his favourite ingredients into the pan. All very well, but if one is curry and another custard it will not prove a successful mix. Gerrard and Butt did not look natural partners in the centre, getting in each other's way, and Scholes was ineffectual on the left. Throw in England's tendency to sit too deep and hit long balls towards their isolated strikers and the fans might have been willing to cover Eriksson in custard at half-time. However, once Scholes was pushed closer to the front players, and Butt picked up possession from the defence and helped the team to play a shorter-passing game, England started to hold the ball and create chances. It would be welcome if Eriksson has finally recognised how best to use Scholes after deploying him too deep in Japan. But though the Swede has found a formation that suits him, he does not yet have the ideal personnel. The left-side problem remains and he can hardly be keen to move Emile Heskey back to the flank after the forward ignored racial abuse to produce such a powerful, impressive display after the interval. \"I thought Emile Heskey was magnificent for us in the second half,\" said Gary Neville, \"doing a lot of difficult jobs in terms of holding it up, getting crosses in and making it difficult for defenders.\" Doubtless Gerrard would prefer to play on the left than not at all, but he relishes the responsibility and thunder of a central role and, when asked to adopt a wide berth for Liverpool, is used on the right. He would be dependable on the opposite flank but most likely not a source of dangerous crosses nor a possessor of the instinct to burst into the penalty area which Eriksson seems to want from that position. Perhaps Eriksson will choose to resolve the problem by playing three narrow midfielders - Beckham, Butt and Gerrard - with Scholes behind the strikers in a 4-3-1-2 formation, asking the full-backs to provide much of the width. Whatever Eriksson decides, Gerrard faces an unusually nervous wait before Wednesday's starting XI is announced."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
