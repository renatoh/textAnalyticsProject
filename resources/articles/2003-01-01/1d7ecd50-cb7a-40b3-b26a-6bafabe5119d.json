Ms Caplin, who advises Mrs Blair on everything from clothes to diet and fitness, is understood to have struck a one-year deal to write about health, mind and body issues for the newspaper. It is understood she is being paid close to \u00a3100,000 for the column, which will appear in the Night and Day supplement. Her decision to write a column will surprise many of her supporters, who were astonished by the Mail on Sunday's relentless pursual of Ms Caplin and her boyfriend. The move will almost certainly lead to accusations of hypocrisy by her critics. However, insiders say it is testament to the skills of the editor of Night and Day, Christina Appleyard. \"She is a fantastic operator, she is brilliant at bringing these people on board,\" said a source. Ms Caplin, like all those close to the prime minister's family, has signed a strict confidentially contract regarding her dealings with Mrs Blair. However, as the Mail on Sunday's sister paper so waspishly pointed out on Saturday, Ms Caplin and her mother have been quick to capitalise on their recent notoriety. \"In a bid to boost their images (and make money from their new 'celebrity') both Caplin mother and daughter have been busy negotiating individual advice columns in newspapers - Carole offering tips on health and fitness with Sylvia dispensing her thoughts on alternative therapies,\" the paper claimed. The paper also suggested Ms Caplin's influence in the Blair household is \"stronger than ever\". Until now Ms Caplin's dealings with the Mail and the Mail on Sunday have been fraught. It was the Sunday paper that sensationally revealed Mr Foster, a convicted Australian fraudster, had advised Mrs Blair on the purchase of two flats in Bristol. The story quickly escalated after Downing Street's denials proved to be misleading and a devastating set of emails between Mr Foster and Mrs Blair were published. Ms Caplin, however, has been media savvy throughout the affair. Three days before the Mail on Sunday's splash and realising a media storm was about to break, she hired PR agency Maclaurin Media to represent her. It is believed the Maclaurin managing director, Ian Monk, brokered Ms Caplin's column deal with the Mail on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
