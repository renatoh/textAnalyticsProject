Mr Blair has not seen President George Bush since last year, but his aides recognise he is facing serious resistance to the government's plans to help Africa - to be tabled at the G8 summit in Gleneagles starting July 6. Disappointment would be a serious blow after he and his government raised hopes of a turning point in the fortunes of Africa. No 10 said no final decision had been made on whether Mr Blair will undertake personal visits, which could also include some EU capitals, or instead do the same persuasion work through video-conferencing. Mr Blair has promised to return to the domestic agenda in the wake of his re-election, but in reality the presidency of the G8 followed by the British EU presidency in July makes it impossible for Mr Blair to turn his back on the world stage. The prime minister and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, are preparing for a series of meetings over the next six weeks that will decide the fate of the G8 summit. One of the most important will be the meeting of the G8 finance ministers on June 10 and 11. Mr Blair is seeking G8 support for his Commission for Africa report which called for a doubling of aid to Africa, extensive multilateral and bilateral debt relief and opening up of developed countries' markets. Nelson Mandela, the former South African president, visited Washington this week to lobby for the British-devised package. But a number of G8 governments, including the Americans, have said they cannot make the long-term commitment to double aid to Africa to $100m (\u00a354m.3) a year though an international finance facility since their budgetary processes do not allow for this. The US and Germany are also sceptical about the benefits of extensive debt relief. The chancellor is insisting that any debt write-off should leave poor countries with additional resources to pay for schools and hospitals, and is concerned that a US counter proposal would allow rich countries to finance debt relief by cutting their aid budgets. If there is a relative failure at the G8 on Africa and climate change, some EU G8 members will want Mr Blair to say this in public and criticise the US, something he is unlikely to do. In frantic continuing lobbying efforts a largely British business group, Business Action for Africa, is trying to bring large corporations together to draw up an action plan ahead of the summit, in order to influence G8 governments. Its founder members are UK-listed companies including Anglo American, SABMiller, Rio Tinto and Unilever. EU finance ministers on June 7 are also due to discuss the idea for a voluntary levy on air travel to finance development aid, an idea first floated by the French and supported by the Germans. The levy would be voluntary on passengers and may be implemented by only a few EU countries. The airline tax would help fund the International Finance Facility (IFF) for Immunisation, the body set up by donor countries which would issue bonds to raise cash to buy vaccines. The mini-IFF is seen as a pilot project for a broader development fund-raising scheme, the IFF proper. As part of its lobbying British officials will attend the World Economic Forum's annual sou-thern African summit in Cape Town from June 1-3, and the US Corporate Council on Africa meeting from June 21-23."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
