Please do not add spoilers from later episodes. We left Offred in defiant mood last week, but she still has to supress \u201cJune\u201d in her bid for survival. This week, she pushes Serena too far, but finds a surprising ally once more in Fred. I can\u2019t image him trusting her again in the slightest after her disappearing act. The before time It is Serena\u2019s turn to remember snapshots of her path to Gilead, one in which she leads from the front, by the looks of things. Fred accompanies her to a speaking engagement, only for her passionate words to be shouted down while he watches things turn nasty. The moment Serena is shot getting into the car is shocking and the first sign we have seen that the new government faced series opposition during their rise to power. She calls it terrorism, of course. Later, in hospital, Fred gets emotional and Serena barks at him: \u201cStop that. Be a man.\u201d It is almost as if we are watching Macbeth. The similarities are obvious. I don\u2019t fancy his chances as Thane of Cawdor if the mutterings between Commander Price and Nick are anything to go by. Gilead And so to the sunlit uplands \u2013 it is either crisp sunbeams or heavy rain in Gilead, nothing in between \u2013 where Offred is given the all-clear by the doctor, baby still baking safely, and sent back to the Waterfords. Serena almost kills her with kindness, letting her see the baby scan and giving her the use of a sitting room. She will do anything to get this baby out safely, despite her loathing of the incubator. In Serena\u2019s sitting room \u2013 turquoise walls, pale sunlight flooding in through gauzy drapes as per \u2013 Nick comes to her and calls her June. \u201cWhat is her bedtime anyway?\u201d June asks of Nick\u2019s new wife, Eden. She tells him they have to \u201cbe smart\u201d and, later, that he must sleep with his child bride so that she does not report him for being a \u201cgender traitor\u201d. Having effectively tried to commit suicide, June seems surprisingly able to ease herself back into Waterford life. The scene is set for the imminent opening of the new Red Centre, a project of which Fred takes charge. Little does he know what is about to happen to all those tonnes of steel and glass, so carefully put there as a monument to inhumanity. Eden\u2019s attempts at pleasing her new husband are quietly excruciating and I loved the use of her as a teenager whose hormonal urges could prove dangerous to the men around her. Nick and the young Eye she kisses in the courtyard could find themselves on the wall thanks to her. She is Carrie, a mass of hormones and insecurity, waiting to erupt. June\u2019s \u201cI thought she could be decent\u201d to Nick after Serena refuses her access to her daughter is exasperating. She willingly assists in monthly rapes for the good of humanity. Reason does not come into it. These are religious nutters. As Nick reluctantly consummates his marriage, Fred comes to June\u2019s room and tries to rekindle their physical relationship. She walks a fine line between keeping him sweet (thanks to that longed-for photo of Hannah) and gently repelling his advances for fear of hurting \u201cthe baby\u201d. \u201cOur little secret,\u201d says Fred, like the abuser he is. Serena resumes her unpleasant power games with Offred, ignoring the doctor\u2019s calls for harmony. Meanwhile, at the Red Centre, it is all about to kick off. Ofglen breaks from the pack of handmaids standing outside the windows during Fred\u2019s speech and turns to show her sisters the bomb in her hand, giving them time to run. Then she pelts down the aisle and detonates the device, sending glass splinters in all directions. Makes a change from the usual despair. The sound of music Oh Bondage! Up Yours! by X-Ray Spex crashes into the end of this episode with a shout of pure rebellion. Blessed be the fruit. May the lord open. Grim scale No boil-covered faces or brutally tortured women this week. Just a couple of shootings and the usual compliment of loveless procreating. An almost uplifting two. Under his eye Fred\u2019s \u201cThis is America\u201d, as he and Serena are bundled out of the lecture hall, their free speech curtailed, is particularly ironic. The student\u2019s scream of \u201cNazi cunt\u201d at Serena sent chills down my spine alongside the news coming out of the United States. When Serena forgets that Ofglen\u2019s tongue has been cut out, I would have forgiven the dumbstruck handmaid a hefty eye-roll at the very least. It turns out she was saving herself for something more to the point."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
