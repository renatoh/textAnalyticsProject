Bill Belichick, who has coached Gronkowksi for his entire professional career, paid tribute to a player he believes is one of the greatest tight ends in history. \u201cRob\u2019s impact on our team and organization was felt in many ways,\u201d Belichick said in a statement. \u201cIn the ultimate team sport, Rob was a great, great teammate. His production spoke for itself, but his daily attitude, unmistakably positive energy wherever he went and toward whoever he touched will never be forgotten. Rob will leave an indelible mark on the Patriots organization and the game as among the best, most complete players at his position to ever play.\u201d Gronkowski, a three-time Super Bowl champion who turns 30 in May, established himself as one of the most dominant tight ends in NFL history. He was named to the Pro Bowl five times and an All-Pro four times. But he has been dogged in recent seasons by back, knee, ankle and arm injuries that have limited his ability to stay on the field. \u201cI\u2019m really satisfied with how my whole career has been. Super satisfied. There\u2019s ups and downs, but the thing is always coming back,\u201d he said before this year\u2019s Super Bowl. \u201cThere\u2019s so many examples of great players here before me, when I was young, to look up to and see how they bounce back when something adverse comes their way.\u201d He finishes his career with 521 receptions for 7,861 yards and 79 touchdowns and was one of the most dominant receivers in the game when he was fully fit. He was also know for his colorful personality on and off the field."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
