About 500 positions are to go at the confectionery business in Slough, but jobs at Mars operations in Kings Lynn, Leeds, Leicestershire and Peterborough will also be affected. Owner Masterfoods said around 370 jobs would also be lost at plants in France and Germany as part of the same programme. At present, Mars employs about 3,500 people in the UK, including 1,600 in Slough. Pierre Laubies, president of Masterfoods Europe, said: \"The proposals are all about growth and competitiveness. We need to be leaner and more focused.\" Under the scheme, Mars will invest around \u00a345m at its chocolate factory at Dundee Road in Slough, one of the five European factories making Mars Bars, and some of the products made at the nearby Liverpool Road site will be transferred there. Manufacture of other confectionery brands, such as Starburst and Twix, at Liverpool Road will be moved to plants in the Czech Republic, Germany and Holland. Liverpool Road will be closed during the next 18 months. The announcement came under fire from unions. Frank Loveday of the Bakers, Food and Allied Union, said: \"The workers are in a state of shock because there has always been a feeling that Masterfoods would never make big job losses. The company made \u00a3140m last year and just wants to make more.\" A Masterfoods spokesman declined to comment on profitability. He said the firm had begun a consultation in January that focused on three areas, relatively low growth, manufacturing capacity and overheads in the European operation. Masterfoods, which is owned by the family-controlled Mars Inc, said it would seek to keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum by offering workers voluntary redundancy, early retirement and redeployment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
