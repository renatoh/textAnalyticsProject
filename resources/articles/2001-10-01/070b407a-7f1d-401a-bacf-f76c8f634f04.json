Too pass\u00e9. Too out, we concluded. Too done to death. The Indian Ocean is the hip place to be. As you can see, we changed our mind and this week we have a Caribbean special. This is the direct result of some clever persuasion from Bronwyn Gold Blyth, travel public-relations supremo who, to the shock of the whole travel industry, died last week. 'Whole areas depend on tourism now that the banana business has declined and there are still lots of hidden areas to be discovered,' she said. She persuaded us that the Caribbean was still important, even though several of her clients included tour operators to the rival Indian Ocean. As everyone knows, there's a lot of spin in travel which verges on the ridiculous. PRs will tell you a hotel that looks like a multistorey car-park is fabulous, if it means getting you to write about it. Bronwyn was not into wasting your time. Bronwyn, aged 55, was head of BGB &amp; Associates, which is now the biggest travel PR firm in the UK. In 10 years, she built her firm from three people to 40. The company's numerous clients include the Caribbean Tourism Organisation, Australian Tourist Commission and Northern Ireland Tourist Board. She was passionate about travel and the environment and became a driving force in the British Airways Tourism for Tomorrow awards. In fact, it was she who convinced BA to get involved in the awards in the first place. She told colleagues that the greatest moment of her career was standing on the airport Tarmac waving the first charter flight off from the UK to Australia. It meant that Australia, her homeland, had become a mainstream holiday destination, not a once-in-a-lifetime trip. When I met her for lunch three weeks ago, she had lots to say about travel after 11 September. She was always a big fan of India (it was not a client) and was particularly upset at the amount of fear and cancellations to the country (in her opinion, unnecessarily) which meant economic hardship for many ordinary people there. She will be sorely missed by everyone who knew her."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
