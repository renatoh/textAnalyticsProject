The 19-year-old scrum-half, introduced in the 57th minute when Leeds trailed 26-10, sparked a remarkable fight-back with his predatory finishing skills. He sent Keith Senior over for the first of the centre's two tries two minutes after coming on for Matt Diskin. The teenager then latched on to a Rob Burrow pass to leave the Wigan defence for dead on a 40-metre dash to the line. Senior soon crashed in for his second try on 68 minutes, with Ben Walker's goal tying the scores. Then with four minutes left McGuire took a pass from Barry McDermott to race away for the try, goaled by Walker, which sealed fourth place for Leeds and a home draw in the play-offs against Hull, who last night lost 32-18 to Hull. It was a sad ending for the Wigan captain Adrian Lam, who created four of his side's tries including two in the opening five minutes of the second half, his kicks setting up touchdowns for Sean O'Loughlin and Martin Aspinwall before McGuire took over. Wigan had raced into a 16-0 lead inside 20 minutes with their scrum-half Lam calling the shots. The Warriors hooker Terry Newton's kick had set up the third-minute try for the veteran back Gary Connolly, then Lam's stunning midfield break sent Craig Smith haring to the line, and Wigan were awarded a penalty try. The loose forward Danny Tickle improved both scores and the Rhinos were hit again when Sean Briscoe took a Lam pass to score in the corner. Leeds desperately needed a response and it came when their substitute forward Wayne McDonald stretched over in the 24th minute to launch a spirited fightback. Leeds were not to be denied and Kevin Sinfield sent Andy Hay over in their next move.
