Neither went well.", "bodyText": "\u2022 Let us return to that porky pie told by Michael Gove in a morale -trashing speech to thinktankers last week. \"When you go into those schools, you can smell the sense of defeatism,\" he said of the Labour-run schools of east Durham. To which Labour-ites and east Durham-ites took great exception. It would be a cheap shot if true, they said. It isn't true. And anyway, the secretary of state has never even been here. And so we posed the question to the Department for Education: when, if ever, did the secretary of state visit a school in east Durham? We waited all day, in vain. Fortunately Gove was available to MPs at education questions. His first line of defence was attack. \"It is the case that east Durham performs less well than the rest of the county of Durham,\" he told Easington MP Grahame Morris. But Alex Cunningham from Stockton North wasn't being fobbed off. \"Will he say how many of the schools he referred to he has actually visited or will he have the decency to apologise for his remarks?\" Cornered, Gove kind of 'fessed up. I visited north and north-west Durham and they told me about east Durham, he said. Thereby confirming that he hadn't actually been to any schools in east Durham and hadn't been able to smell much of anything. The Speaker saved him further humiliation. \u2022 So another fine mess. How did the ed sec get into it? The answer came as he fended off attack from Sedgefield MP Phil Wilson. \"Perhaps the most telling remarks about the lack of ambition in schools in east Durham were uttered by Lord Adonis,\" he said. \"Having visited a school there, he said that a teacher had told him. 'In the past children turned right to work in the shipyards or left to work in the coal mines. Now they might as well walk on into the sea.' That spirit of defeatism reported by the noble lord is exactly what we need to attack,\" harrumphed the secretary of state. But even that unravelled after some sharp work by the Northern Echo. \"The remark was uttered at least 10 years ago \u2013 about a school that has since closed and reopened as a privately sponsored academy,\" reported the paper's parliamentary correspondent, Robert Merrick. Merrick also spoke to Lord Adonis. \"I don't think Michael Gove would get a GCSE pass for accuracy or relevance,\" the peer told him. \"He has taken a quote of mine, from 10 years ago, completely out of context \u2014 about a school that has since closed. That is not what I expect an education secretary to do.\" But then have we ever had an education secretary quite like the incumbent? \u2022 For every action, a reaction. And Sarah Teather's decision to commit hari-kiri in Brent Central \u2013 compounding her support for tuition fees (which she originally opposed) with her opposition to gay marriage (which she initially supported) \u2013 has prompted much activity. Particularly in the Labour party. Many hope for a minority candidate in a winnable seat, but there is a spectre at the feast. There is talk that Brent Central could be just right for the return to parliament of the former mayor of London \u2013 and former Brent East MP \u2013 Ken Livingstone. Is that likely, we ask him. \"Absolute rubbish,\" he says. There have been soundings, and the public raises it from time to time, he says. \"But I will be 70 by the time of the next election. Everyone of my generation is either dead or gone; John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown.\" So what does the future hold? \"I'm a house husband,\" says Ken. The others can slug it out. Game on. \u2022 That isn't to say Livingstone has no further ambitions. He has in his sights a vacancy on the board of the Zoological Society of Great Britain, which runs his beloved London Zoo. A current board member bows out this month; Boris Johnson's father, Stanley. Wrong Johnson, wrong vacancy, you might think. Still, a prize worth having. \u2022 Finally, the current issue of New Left Review carries an interview with the late anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss. There were many difficulties researching the lives of semi-nomadic tribes, he said. \"They were never there when you were supposed to meet them\". Next week: Ben Ainslie's problems with the sea.
