Kadyrov has engaged in increasingly hostile rhetoric towards the Russian opposition in recent weeks. The video was issued weeks before the first anniversary of the murder of Boris Nemtsov, another prominent opposition figure. On Monday night, the video was removed from Kadyrov\u2019s Instagram account. Zaur Dadayev, a high-ranking officer in Kadyrov\u2019s security forces, has been charged with gunning down Nemtsov, Kasyanov\u2019s co-chairman of the RPR-Parnas party, near the Kremlin in February 2015. Russia\u2019s investigative committee said on Friday it had closed the case, although Ruslan Mukhudinov, a Chechen security officer who is charged with organising the hit, remains at large. \u201cKasyanov has come to Strasbourg for money for the Russian opposition,\u201d Kadyrov wrote as he posted the video for his 1.6 million Instagram followers. \u201cWhoever didn\u2019t understand will get it,\u201d he added, a phrase that is also the title of a forthcoming self-produced action film starring the Chechen leader, who has frequently been accused of human rights abuses. Last week, Kasyanov, a former Russian prime minister, called on deputies at a parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg to prepare a special report on the Nemtsov murder investigation and warned that Kadyrov\u2019s comments, labelling the opposition \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, marked a broader crackdown on regime critics. During the trip, he also told the exiled Crimean Tatar leader, Mustafa Dzhemilev, that Crimea would eventually be returned to Ukraine. In a Facebook post on Monday, Kasyanov called the crosshairs video a \u201cdirect threat of a murder motivated by political hatred\u201d and said President Vladimir Putin, who appointed Kadyrov in 2007, \u201cbears personal responsibility for Kadyrov\u2019s actions\u201d and should condemn them. Instagram deleted the crosshairs video for violating its rule that users respect one another, a spokesperson told Vedomosti newspaper. The RPR-Parnas deputy chairman, Vladimir Kara-Murza, seen walking with Kasyanov in the video, called it an \u201cinstigation to murder\u201d. Kara-Murza said he was the victim of a poisoning attempt similar to that of Alexander Litvinenko after he suffered sudden illness and organ failure in May, as a result of which he now walks with a cane. The video is the latest attack in Kadyrov\u2019s war of words against Russia\u2019s liberal opposition, which has been increasingly marginalised since tensions with the west began rising in 2014. In January, Kadyrov employed the Stalin-era phrase \u201cenemies of the people\u201d to argue that opposition activists were puppets of western intelligence and should be prosecuted for treason. Magomed Daudov, the head of Kadyrov\u2019s administration, posted a photograph of his boss with a Caucasian sheepdog named Tarzan, declaring that its \u201cfangs are itching\u201d for opposition activists and journalists. Kadyrov even held a giant rally against the opposition in Chechnya\u2019s capital, Grozny, where Daudov listed Kasyanov as one of many \u201ctraitors\u201d. Putin, who awarded Kadyrov a medal days after Nemtsov\u2019s killing, has continued to condone his actions, praising him at the end of January for \u201cworking effectively\u201d. In response to the \u201cenemies of the people\u201d remark, Konstantin Senchenko, a Krasnoyarsk city council member, called Kadyrov an \u201cembarrassment to Russia\u201d but later apologised after a backlash. Kadyrov posted a video of Senchenko apologising, with the caption: \u201cI accept.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
