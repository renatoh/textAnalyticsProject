Unfortunately for Julian White, he is anything but. This was a magnificent game, featuring pace, skill, power, eight tries, some weak defending and high emotions, but still the main talking point afterwards was the red card that White was shown in only the 23rd minute for the haymaker he landed on the chin of Andrew Sheridan. It is not as if it were the first the strong, silent fellow from the nether regions of the front row has landed in his career, and it is not as if it were the first red card he has seen. \"To the letter of the law it was a red card \u2013 fair enough,\" said Geordan Murphy, Leicester's captain in the absence of the recently suspended Martin Corry and Aaron Mauger. \"It was just a little disappointing, as I'd taken one 10 minutes before, and Sheridan admitted that he gave Julian a couple before he got one in retaliation. \"I think Julian's unlucky. He's cursed in that he knows how to throw a punch. If I threw 10 of those I'd miss and get laughed at. Julian feels really bad, but hopefully the citing committee might take into consideration the fact that he got a couple before he sent one back.\" They may, but they may equally take into consideration the previous of a man whose formative years were spent \"defending himself\" in an era when punches on the bonce were a dime a dozen. But, if we can put political correctness to one side for a moment, it was a wholly non-cynical swing at a fellow behemoth who was standing face-to-face with him and had just sent over a little jab of his own a second before. A yellow for both men would have sufficed. It all contributed to the drama, though, which reached another pitch when Sheridan was substituted in the final quarter. The Crumbie Stand jeered and goaded him as he walked to the dug-out, and the normally affable titan stood full-square in front of it, seeming to invite the lot of them out from the sanctuary of the crowd. \"That's what you get at Welford Road,\" said Kingsley Jones, Sale's director of rugby. \"It might have been worse at Kingsholm, I suppose, but it's all part of the day out.\" Jones was more distraught that his side had come away with only one point, when he thinks they could have had five. To have conceded five tries, three of them to 14 men, even at Welford Road, is not the stuff of champions, but Sale contributed richly to the entertainment. They may only be five points adrift of the play-offs with two games to play, but in this tightest-ever instalment of what is always one of the closest fought competitions in sport, that is looking like a yawning gap. Leicester, though, have hit the front at just the right time. They also have a quarter-final against Bath in the Heineken Cup next weekend at the Walkers Stadium, their temporary home while Welford Road is redeveloped. Losing White for a few weeks, as seems likely, will not help as they gather for the climax of the season. Imagine what an asset he would be if he just learnt to miss occasionally.
