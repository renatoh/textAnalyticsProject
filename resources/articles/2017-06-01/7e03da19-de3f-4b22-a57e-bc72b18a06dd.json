The 60-year-old British actor, who has won three Oscars, will make his final screen appearance in Phantom Thread, a fashion drama that reunites him with Paul Thomas Anderson, director of There Will Be Blood. \u201cDaniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor,\u201d a statement to Variety from his spokeswoman Leslee Dart read. \u201cHe is immensely grateful to all of his collaborators and audiences over the many years. This is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject.\u201d The star has previously taken extended breaks from the industry, including a late-90s stint as an apprentice shoemaker in Florence. \u201cMy life as it is away from the movie set is a life where I follow my curiosity just as avidly as when I am working,\u201d he said in a 2008 interview with the Observer. \u201cIt is with a very positive sense that I keep away from the work for a while. It has always seemed natural to me that that, in turn, should help me in the work that I do.\u201d After breaking out in 1985 drama My Beautiful Laundrette, Day-Lewis won his first Oscar for his role as an artist with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot. The 90s saw him work with Martin Scorsese in The Age of Innocence, Michael Mann in Last of the Mohicans and again with the My Left Foot director Jim Sheridan, in In the Name of the Father and The Boxer. The following decade, he worked with Scorsese again in Gangs of New York and won two further best actor Oscars for There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. His final film, Phantom Thread, released this Christmas, is set in London\u2019s fashion scene in the 50s. He will play a dressmaker catering to high society.
