Ahead of our countdown of the resulting 50 best albums of the year, we\u2019re kicking off with a list of the 20 best songs. We\u2019ve also put as many as possible of the 593 tracks that were voted for into a Spotify and Apple Music playlist. 20 Fat White Family \u2013 Feet For the Serfs Up! album, which opened with this track, Fat White Family moved to Sheffield to get off heroin \u2013 but, it transpired, this merely meant not injecting it. That paradox suffuses Feet: its groove has very much got its shit together, but there\u2019s still a sickness at its heart. It\u2019s like a sleazy wallflower who slinks out of the dingy corner of some dive bar, and, snake-hipped, starts throwing some unexpectedly impressive disco shapes on the floor. BBT 19 Lizzo \u2013 Tempo (feat Missy Elliott) Lizzo made her name this year with her powerfully positive affirmations of selfhood, but Tempo tees off in much snarkier style: \u201cSlow songs, they for skinny hoes,\u201d she declares. \u201cI\u2019m a thick bitch, I need tempo.\u201d Sure enough, this is a sterner, clubbier track than her other big 2019 hits Juice and Truth Hurts (the latter not eligible for this list as it first came out in 2017). Her incitement to cunnilingus is admirably casual, but Missy Elliott steals the show with her menagerie of purrs and trills. BBT 18 Mark Ronson \u2013 Late Night Feelings (feat Lykke Li) Self-destructive behaviour wouldn\u2019t be so common if there were no thrill involved: the fantasy that your desires might pan out after all, even though you know there\u2019s not a hope in hell. It\u2019s that perverse optimism that Mark Ronson captures in Late Night Feelings. Even as Lykke Li catalogues the torments doled out by her would-be lover, the distant steel pan chime, sparkling disco chorus and sugar-spun melodies maintain the glimmering mirage of possibility. LS 17 Normani \u2013 Motivation Motivation is the pop equivalent of an Olympics-winning gymnastics routine: Normani serves take-it-or-leave-it cool, effortless vocal workouts and nonchalant cheerleader authority on the Ariana Grande co-write. In the video, her athletic choreography and throwback bellybutton piercing evoke the drilled spectacles of millennium-era Britney and Beyonc\u00e9. The former Fifth Harmony member swiftly establishes her own brand of excellence, and demands that lovers and fans alike recognise her game. LS 16 AJ Tracey \u2013 Ladbroke Grove AJ Tracey might have been a touch worried about his mainstream prospects: the first single from his album only reached No 18 in the charts, and he was upstaged on one of his biggest tracks to date, Thiago Silva, by the bucket-hatted Alex going viral with AJ\u2019s verse on stage with Dave at Glastonbury. Luckily, he had Ladbroke Grove up his sleeve. This shamelessly nostalgic UK garage track dominated the summer, AJ toasting like a club MC being heckled with champagne. No street corner was left unmolested by the words \u201cYo, it\u2019s the hyperman set!\u201d blasting from a hatchback\u2019s open windows. BBT 15 Lana Del Rey \u2013 The Greatest Having the freedom not to care is harder to come by for some people than others \u2013 and harder to come by at all these days. Those rare moments of reprieve aren\u2019t the banner memories of mental supercuts, but fleeting sensations you don\u2019t miss until they\u2019re gone. On The Greatest, Lana Del Rey watches those squandered moments slip away on the breeze as news of missile attacks, forest fires and Kanye West darkens the horizon. Elegant and valedictory, it\u2019s a masterpiece of west coast songwriting classicism: \u201cI guess I\u2019m signing off after all,\u201d she gasps, and a rich, rusty guitar solo soars out of the gate, languid and carefree as a skateboarder sailing along the boardwalk. LS 14 Stormzy \u2013 Vossi Bop With a Glastonbury headline slot on the horizon and a crown to maintain, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking Stormzy would return with some kind of weighty, state-of-the-nation opus. Nah: the twitchy, tantalising Vossi Bop was a raw reminder of his charisma, the way he kisses words like the pope anointing a baby (\u201cgyal say I\u2019m bougie\u201d) and how pretenders wither to dust in his gaze. \u201cThe rules are kinda different when you\u2019re baddin\u2019 up the game,\u201d indeed. LS 13 Dave \u2013 Black Unlike the three tracks from his album Psychodrama that reached the Top 10, Black scraped the Top 40, and \u2013 being a bleak, jaded treatise on contemporary racism \u2013 it stuck out like a sore thumb amid the poppy stuff on daytime Radio 1. Dave confronts one ill after another like he can scarcely believe his own words: colonialism, social mobility, media sensationalism \u2026 but ultimately, there\u2019s such pride as he considers his hair, his history, his skin. BBT 12 Big Thief \u2013 Not With two albums in 2019 stuffed full of instantly classic songs \u2013 Forgotten Eyes, Cattails, Shoulders, Orange \u2013 Brooklyn\u2019s Big Thief are the band of the year. Votes from our critics were split across six different songs, but edging out in front was Not, a masterpiece of indie rock with a savage truth at its heart. In a world besieged by lies, we can no longer say what we are, only what we\u2019re not. This comes out as a wry, poetic laundry list from Adrianne Lenker: \u201cNot a ruse / Not heat / Not the fire lapping up the creek / Not food / That you eat.\u201d The matter-bending guitar solo has the ragged glory of Neil Young\u2019s finest. BBT 11 Rosal\u00eda and J Balvin \u2013 Con Altura It\u2019s hard to remember any self-made star having such a swift and well-deserved rise to the top as Rosal\u00eda, who already commands outsized influence given her relatively brief career to date (see: Camila Cabello\u2019s second album). This year she released an embarrassment of brilliant one-off singles that show off her wide-ranging prowess, from uncompromising experimentation (A Pal\u00e9 and Aute Cuture) to nimble pop flexes such as Con Altura. It is completely addictive: the combined charisma of the Spanish star and J Balvin snaking around the blunt dembow stutter and a synth whirr that coos like a curious wood pigeon. LS 10 Georgia \u2013 About Work the Dancefloor One of the year\u2019s warmest success stories: when Georgia released Started Out, the first single from her second album for indie Domino, at the end of 2018, it became a surprise Radio 1 hit. So did its follow-up, About Work the Dancefloor, prompting the label to push her album to 2020 to give the singles time to breathe. AWtD is a fine teaser for a record that is worth the wait, showing off Georgia\u2019s newfound focus on songcraft and the depth of her references as a producer (the satisfyingly meaningless title is her tribute to the robotic proclamations of Detroit techno forefathers Cybotron). Lacing the juddering pulse of adrenaline with her vulnerable vocal delivery, AWtD puts Georgia in the big, Robyn-shaped pop leagues. LS 9 Clairo \u2013 Bags The hot, wretched sickness of young love is rendered so acutely here by 21-year-old US indie-pop star Clairo. There\u2019s a sullen black humour as she war-games the worst thing that could happen \u2013 her lover walking out with their bags \u2013 as a way to edge away from the erotic terror of the best thing happening. \u201cCan you see me using everything to hold back?\u201d she frets, holding nothing back. The backing, an idle but quietly feverish patter of garage rock, also tries to play it cool but can\u2019t quite manage it, its main instrumental melody searching up and down for a foothold. BBT 8 Richard Dawson \u2013 Jogging This was the Newcastle outsider folk artist\u2019s poppiest moment by far \u2013 and also, in a catalogue full of tender humanity, his most powerfully humane. He voices someone \u201cstruggling with anxiety\u201d, who is freaked out by a tutting checkout girl and thinks a busker is using Wonderwall to swear at them. Racist violence is close at hand. But jogging \u2013 represented here by a rolling beat reminiscent of, appropriately, Kate Bush\u2019s Running Up That Hill \u2013 keeps them going. The dogged, synth-laden climax is a triumphant affirmation of the human spirit through personal and social collapse. BBT 7 Vampire Weekend \u2013 Harmony Hall The east coast sibling to Lana Del Rey\u2019s The Greatest: how did we get here, with antisemitism resurgent and \u201cwicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified\u201d, Ezra Koenig asks? As with Del Rey\u2019s valedictory ballad, he avoids obvious musical darkness and shoots for a more striking contrast by invoking the vivid, happy sounds of various 20th-century utopias: the pattering hand percussion calls back to hippies sitting in circles during the age of Aquarius; its sweet guitar filigree is straight out of Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood, the show that taught empathy to a generation of American kids. The rising piano chatter sits halfway between house music and Bruce Hornsby, and by the time the shaky beat kicks in, it\u2019s turned into the ecstasy-laced optimism of the Stone Roses. These eras rise and fall, Koenig suggests, offering his own song so it might be remembered as a gesture of hope and intellect during a particularly senseless one. LS 6 FKA twigs \u2013 Cellophane You imagine FKA twigs was thinking of Blue-era Joni Mitchell when she named her comeback single. \u201cAt that period in my life, I had no personal defences,\u201d Mitchell said years later. \u201cI felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn\u2019t pretend in my life to be strong. Or to be happy. But the advantage of it in the music was that there were no defences there either.\u201d Twigs\u2019s Cellophane comes from the same place, where honesty becomes confrontation. \u201cDidn\u2019t I do it for you?\u201d she asks an ex-lover, as glacial piano and a pocked beat suggest someone circling a precious museum exhibit and gesturing at its impressive facets: what kind of moron could disregard such beauty? But her contempt ebbs away, replaced by gasping desperation that reveals the damage done by their neglect. LS 5 Lizzo \u2013 Juice It\u2019s a misconception that tumultuous political times produce better music, but relative prosperity is certainly responsible for its fair share of drivel. The close of the Obama era was defined by the trifecta of Daft Punk\u2019s Get Lucky, Pharrell\u2019s Happy and Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson\u2019s Uptown Funk, all mining retro good vibes that were addictive yet asinine. Juice is cut from the same cloth, with a warped VHS vibe that only adds to the throwback air. Yet whereas her predecessors served up toothless victory-lap optimism, Lizzo\u2019s calling card single runs on defiance: she\u2019s not looking to the mirror on the wall to affirm her excellence, but proclaiming it with a riot of radical food gags. She\u2019s \u201cthe pudding in the proof\u201d, \u201cdrippin\u2019 so much sauce got a bitch looking like ragu\u201d. LS 4 Billie Eilish \u2013 Bad Guy Pop tends to stand up straight, but Bad Guy crouched. It was a delightfully malevolent presence in the charts this year, a shadow between the sprightly boasts of pop-rap and the howled emotion of pop ballads. The melody is the kind of thing Tim Burton would use to announce the arrival of an evil Victorian workhouse owner. Eilish, casting herself as a \u201cmight-seduce-your-dad type\u201d, teases you right in your ear, so close you can hear every tiny creak and breath \u2013 and then, with that none-so-teenage \u201cduh!\u201d, she laughs at how much she\u2019s freaked you out. The result is the most original pop song of the year. BBT 3 Charli XCX \u2013 Gone (feat Christine and the Queens) The pressure of expectations is a topic that pop stars, jaded after their ascent, often end up visiting. But they are rarely this tortured. \u201cAm I a smoke? Am I the sun? Who decides?\u201d wonders Chris, poetically losing control of her own narrative; Charli, meanwhile, is \u201cjust now realising they don\u2019t care\u201d, and, chillingly, she could mean anyone. The glitched-up coda sees meaning dissolve altogether. But the brilliance of the echoing electro-funk backing offers a route out: you can always dance through a crisis. BBT 2 Sharon Van Etten \u2013 Seventeen Growing up mostly means shedding naivety, getting less headstrong, sanding down the youthful volatility that just adds unnecessary friction to life. But what if we smooth off the wrong edges, betraying idealism and determination for the sake of an easier ride? On Seventeen, Sharon Van Etten beholds her younger self with equal measures tenderness, frustration and envy, while remaining well aware of how resistant that tempestuous girl would be to her concern; how withering she would be of what she has become. A Jersey girl herself, she borrows classic Springsteen-y triumph for this perfectly pitched epic powered by heroism and hubris. LS 1 Lil Nas X \u2013 Old Town Road (remix feat Billy Ray Cyrus) Not only is it the most popular song of 2019, spending a record-breaking 19 consecutive weeks at No 1 in the US, plus 10 weeks in the UK Top 3, Old Town Road is also the most 2019 song of 2019. Its initial traction came from people miming to it on TikTok as part of the \u201cyeehaw\u201d viral craze for amusingly hackneyed cowboy shenanigans. It was then boosted by an identity-politics controversy after it was deemed not country enough for the country charts \u2013 the subsequent addition of the none-more-country Billy Ray Cyrus for the remix was a rebuttal of utter mic-drop magnificence. Using the absurdist deadpan humour of meme culture weaponised its online popularity, while splicing rap and country earned it twice as many fans \u2013 and the line \u201cridin\u2019 on my tractor / lean all in my bladder\u201d did both at once. It would all have been for naught, though, were it not a completely brilliant song, top to bottom. Every part, from the drawled verses to the hearty chorus and taunting bridge, sounds amazing hollered from the back of a car, karaoke bar, or Shetland pony ride. Its biggest line may be a triple negative \u2013 \u201ccan\u2019t nobody tell me nothing\u201d \u2013 but Old Town Road\u2019s success is nothing but positive.
