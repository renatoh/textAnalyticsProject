Murray was the first to admit that his 7-6, 6-3 defeat by the American Donald Young, the world No143, in the second round of the BNP Paribas Open was unacceptable for someone of his standard. There are about 10 days to go until the Miami Masters 1000 and the Briton's performances there will show whether this is a blip or something more serious. It is, of course, only six weeks since Murray was one win away from taking his first grand-slam title, when he lost to Novak Djokovic in the final of the Australian Open, so it is obvious that when his mind is in the right place his tennis is absolutely top class. However, with memories of this time last year still fresh, when having lost to Roger Federer in the final in Melbourne, he played (by his own admission) \"garbage\" until he reached the semi\u2011finals at Wimbledon, Murray knows he has to sort himself out quickly if he is not to suffer the same kind of slump. \"I've got to use this defeat as some motivation,\" he said. \"I don't really enjoy playing like that and I don't want to lose matches like that. My mentality was kind of the same on the court as it was last year, just not finding a way of really being 110% focused on getting myself back into the match. \"It took me a long time after Australia [last year] to start finding that again. I don't want that to happen again so I need find a way \u2013 not only with myself, but with the guys I work with \u2013 to get it back as soon as possible and hopefully I'll do that in Miami.\" With Murray not having played singles for more than a month there was bound to be some rust in his game but the concern was that against Young, he looked as if his heart just wasn't in it. Murray's strength is that when he is struggling, he usually finds a way to win. This time there was no energy and seemingly no willingness to dig deep and just get the job done. \"It's frustrating because 90% of the time it's not a problem,\" he said. \"It happened five or six times last year and that's one match so far that it's happened this year so I need to try and break that because it's not productive at all.\" He could do worse than look at the example of Rafael Nadal, the world No1, whose intensity did not drop for a second as the Spaniard crushed Rik de Voest of South Africa 6-0, 6-2 to begin his title campaign in ominous fashion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
