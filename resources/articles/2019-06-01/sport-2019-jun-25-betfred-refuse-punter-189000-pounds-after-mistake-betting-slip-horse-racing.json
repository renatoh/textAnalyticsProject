David Smith, a 60-year-old from Loughborough, still received \u00a323,000 from his spectacularly successful choices on that day a fortnight ago but contends that Betfred should have paid him \u00a3212,000 and plans to take the matter to the arbitrator Ibas. Smith\u2019s other five selections in the bet all won: Ardera Cross (40-1), Indian Temple (7-1), Shanroe (9-2), Pennsylvania Dutch (15-2) and Sir Busker (4-1). He argues that he clearly intended to include Bialco, as he wrote \u201c2.15 P\u201d next to Bailarico\u2019s name. Bialco won the 2.15pm race at Perth, whereas Bailarico was third in the 3.40pm at Goodwood. Smith also wrote down the odds that were being offered about Bialco at the time. Smith says he returned to the shop during the afternoon\u2019s racing, after two of his horses had won. Upon checking his slip, he realised his error and explained it to shop staff, at a time when Bialco had won but Bailarico had yet to race. He says he was assured that the bet would be settled on Bialco and that the decision in the shop, after the other horses had won, was to settle it at \u00a3212,000. But when the bet was referred to Betfred security for authorisation the settlement was changed to \u00a323,000. A Betfred spokesman told the Guardian: \u201cUnfortunately the customer had written Bailarico on his slip which was running in a race at Goodwood that day and finished third. Our rules state that we settle on the named selection.\u201d Smith said: \u201cI\u2019m not happy about the way they handled my complaint. There was nobody to explain what really happened.\u201d A regular in the Loughborough shop, he feels sure that his bet would have been corrected at the time of being placed if the manager, who knows him well, had been working and had checked his bet as normal. Smith is being assisted by Paul Fairhead, an online campaigner for punters, who points to another Betfred rule allowing the firm to split stakes between two horses if a bet is deemed ambiguous. Applied in Smith\u2019s case, that would give him an additional payout of approximately \u00a390,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
