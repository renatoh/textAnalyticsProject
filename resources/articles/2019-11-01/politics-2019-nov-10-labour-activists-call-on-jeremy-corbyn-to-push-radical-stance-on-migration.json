Senior Labour figures are expected to meet on Monday to thrash out the details of the party\u2019s policy, but a final decision will not be made until next weekend. Grassroots campaigners succeeded in persuading Labour\u2019s conference in September to adopt a series of radical policy motions on issues including migration, private schools and the climate crisis. But it is unclear how many of the motions will find their way into the manifesto undiluted. Boris Johnson has ditched the immigration target pursued by his two predecessors and is promising a more liberal \u201cpoints based\u201d system. The Tories believe the perception that Labour would be soft on immigration will hurt Corbyn\u2019s party in many Tory target seats in the Midlands and northern England. The home secretary, Priti Patel, responded to comments by Labour\u2019s campaign coordinator, Andrew Gywnne, on Sunday about the benefits of free movement by claiming a Corbyn government would allow \u201cuncontrolled and unlimited immigration\u201d. Gwynne said Labour would seek to strike \u201creciprocal agreements with the EU27 that allow British citizens to enjoy some of the freedoms that they will lose as a result of Brexit\u201d. The free-movement motion passed at Labour conference included a commitment to close all migrant detention centres; abolition of the \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d legislation that prevents migrants from accessing many services; a move to \u201cmaintain and extend free movement rights\u201d; and rejection of \u201cany immigration system based on incomes, migrants\u2019 utility to business, and number caps/targets\u201d. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said no final decision had been made, but stressed the party\u2019s opposition to the hostile environment policy concerning immigration that was established by Theresa May. \u201cWe have got radical proposals, because we are going to close Yarl\u2019s Wood and Brook House [detention centres] and we are going to review the entire detention estate. I\u2019ve said that many times,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also want to put an end to the hostile environment \u2013 and we\u2019re looking at repealing the 2014 Immigration Act, which was part of that.\u201d She added that Labour was determined to tackle the negative culture of the Home Office. \u201cI\u2019m clear that it\u2019s not just about bits of legislation; it\u2019s about the whole way they do things.\u201d Corbyn stressed the benefits of migration last week when he was pressed about whether the Brexit deal Labour was promising to negotiate would include free movement, saying it \u201cenriches the lives of all of us\u201d. Some Labour candidates facing a challenge from the Conservatives and/or the Brexit party fear the perception of a free-for-all on migration will hurt them on 12 December. One jokingly described the prospect of adopting the conference policy in full as \u201cself immolation\u201d. But Alena Ivanova, an organiser for the Labour Campaign for Free Movement, said it would be a vote winner. \u201cParty conference delivered an absolutely huge mandate for the most radical known policy in the party\u2019s history and we are campaigning for it to be adopted fully in the manifesto,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not the case that these are unpopular politics and the Tories are making a mistake if they use them to attack us. The big bulk of voters we need to win over already agree with us that immigration is a good thing. On the other hand, giving ground to the idea that migrants are to blame for the problems caused by austerity undermines our core narrative and weakens our campaign.\u201d Another campaign spokesperson, Sabrina Huck, said Labour should be \u201cthe party of all workers regardless of where they were born\u201d. Labour\u2019s manifesto is being drafted by Corbyn\u2019s policy chief, Andrew Fisher, as was the 2017 document, but it will have to be signed off on Saturday in a meeting known as Clause V involving senior party decision-makers including the unions. One Labour candidate defending a remain seat and sympathetic to the free-movement campaign said they expected the party\u2019s policy to be \u201cas radical as Unite and the GMB will let it be\u201d. Migration is not the only area of contention in the run-up to Saturday\u2019s meeting, with grassroots activists keen to hold Labour to the 2030 target for achieving net-zero carbon emissions. The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has said the party will target net-zero emissions by \u201cthe 2030s\u201d, but climate campaigners believe a specific date would be a more effective policy. Corbyn has also been challenged about the policy of incorporating private schools into the state system, passed after a campaign called #AbolishEton. Asked at his campaign launch whether he would indeed abolish Eton, the Labour leader pointed to the party\u2019s plans to tax private schools more heavily by removing their charitable status."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
