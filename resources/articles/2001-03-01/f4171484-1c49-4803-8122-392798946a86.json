The publication of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth in the series and the fastest selling title in history, helped the small Soho publisher increase turnover by 143% to \u00a350.7m last year. Pretax profits for the year doubled to \u00a35.7m, while the dividend climbed 32% to 5p per share. Chairman Nigel Newton said he believed that the long-term earnings potential of Harry Potter could underpin Bloomsbury for years to come. \"The series is now established as a classic with a long-term life,\" he said. \"The series is being compared to other classics such as Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia which have had huge sales over many decades.\" Bloomsbury refuses to break-out how much Harry Potter contributes to overall group revenues, which analysts have claimed makes the company difficult to value. Mr Newton would only admit that the children's character was \"very important\". Analysts reckon it accounted for 30%-40% last year. Bloomsbury published 400 titles last year including the Booker prize winning Margaret Atwood novel The Blind Assassin. Mr Newton is working digitising the company's backlist of content, including that of A&amp;C Black, the reference publisher behind the Who's Who guide for which he paid \u00a316.4m for last year. He said prospects for the coming year were good with the paperback release of Goblet of Fire scheduled for July and the November release of a Warner Brothers film of Harry Potter, pictured, expected to reignite interest in the earlier books in the series. Shares in Bloomsbury edged up 5p to 717p. Analysts at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite believe they are a good \"defensive investment\" ahead of any further economic downturn as books are seen as still selling during a recession."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
