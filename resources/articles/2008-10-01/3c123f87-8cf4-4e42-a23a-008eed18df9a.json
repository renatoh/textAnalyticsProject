Those were the odds Ladbrokes offered for this result prior to kick-off here but following the suspicion that has built up around these sides' encounter 24 days earlier, one can only wonder how many punters made that bet with confidence. No proof of match-fixing has been discovered regarding the game at Carrow Road on October 4, which Derby County won 2-1, and after the Football Association said its investigation into the allegation had reached an impasse following a lack of cooperation from Asian betting firms. it's unlikely any will \u2013 but there was no doubting the backdrop of intrigue that surrounded tonight's fixture. Onlookers were looking for a dodgy clearance here or a suspect shot there but, in truth, what they got was an absorbing, committed encounter which only added to the claim from both clubs that any involvement by them in a pre-determined result is \"far-fetched\" and \"laughable.\" It should be noted that neither is under suspicion. Derby undoubtedly deserved this victory and, on a close to freezing night in the east Midlands, warmed the hearts of their supporters ahead of the visit of local rivals Nottingham Forest on Sunday. \"For an hour we played as well as we've played all season,\" said the Derby manager, Paul Jewell, afterwards. \"We haven't been too expansive in our previous games but I thought we were terrific in that sense tonight, the ball was being moved left to right a lot.\" Of that there was no doubt and Derby deserve credit for being so positive having conceded a late equaliser at Coventry on Saturday, an outcome that could have conceivably seen them start cautiously last night. The hosts pushed forward almost as one to force Norwich back into their own half and it felt like only a matter of time before they scored. The opening goal duly arrived on 14 minutes, after Paul Green bundled the ball past David Marshall in the Norwich goal following good work by Nathan Ellington on the right wing. Kris Commons and Ellington then both had chances to make it 2-0, before Hulse finally did on 29 minutes with a close-range header. Out-played and out-thought, Norwich could conceivably have crumbled but instead Glenn Roeder's side returned after the interval with a new-found purpose and deservedly pulled a goal back from John Kennedy on 64 minutes. They should have equalised five minutes later when Leroy Lita found himself one-on-one with Stephen Bywater but the on-loan striker pulled his shot wide of the near post. Having survived that scare, the home side rediscovered their composure and sealed victory with Przemyslaw Kazmierczak's 80th minute strike, the Polish midfielder's first for the club. Derby now move to ninth in the Championship and find themselves only two points outside the play-off positions. Norwich, by contrast, remain in 18th and must now prepare for a visit to fifth-placed Burnley on Saturday. Incidentally, Spreadex, the British-based bookmakers that alerted the authorities to a \"massive movement\" in the Asian betting markets during half-time of the Norwich verses Derby match earlier this month, received \"busier than normal\" trade for tonight's match but did not spot any suspicious betting patterns. \"The high number of bets was probably due to the interest drummed up in this match by the media following their last meeting,\" said a Spreadex spokesman. \"But there was nothing unusual in regards to the trading, most punters backed Derby to win.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
