According to singer Vic Banuelos, this song is \u201ca reminder that you can want something really bad, and try really hard, but maybe it\u2019s just not on the cards and that\u2019s OK. Dance it out.\u201d Expect to see Boris Johnson dancing any day now. Ariana Grande Positions Ariana seems to be doing an \u201canti-Craig David\u201d by meeting the parents before anything sexy occurs \u2013 \u201cBoy, I\u2019m tryna meet your mama on a Sunday / Then make a lotta love on a Monday.\u201d I\u2019m intrigued by what the rest of the week in this courtship would look like: maybe Ariana should check if Wetherspoons still does its Curry Club on Thursday. Finneas Can\u2019t Wait to Be Dead Doomed, possibly for ever, to be known as \u201cBillie Eilish\u2019s older brother and co-writer\u201d (especially if people keep mentioning it in articles), Finneas steps away from the amorphous, alluring pop of his collaborator and takes a soft-rock stroll so squarely down the middle of the road he may well be Tarmacked by now. Although \u201cSomebody\u2019s ripping you off /\u205fTrying\u205fto sell you good news / You know we\u2019re still gonna lose\u201d feels very 2020. Hot Chip ft Jarvis Cocker Straight to the Morning Imagine if Pet Shop Boys in their pomp had asked David Byrne to collaborate: good, no? Then forget that and just imagine Hot Chip asking Jarvis Cocker to appear on one of their tracks, because that is what\u2019s actually happened. This both bangs and bops along, and doesn\u2019t even ask permission to get your foot tapping \u2026 which is rude, really. Slow Weather Great White Male If you tell people that you\u2019re really into indie, but in fact Embrace are one of your favourite bands and you always have Radio 2 Drivetime on in the car, this one\u2019s for you. Don\u2019t listen to it while driving, though; it\u2019s like Ambien in music form, only slightly lifted by the guitar break. Open the windows to let in some fresh air and plough on till the next services."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
