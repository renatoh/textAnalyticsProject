How can you reconcile loving a man caught up through his job in doing something, even taking a country to war, with which you fundamentally disagree? Could you trust a woman who has access to your most important work secrets, and who could use them as a weapon against you if she chose to leak them? Sarah Helm is married to Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's chief of staff during the run-up to the Iraq war and in its aftermath. Debut playwrights are often advised to write about what they know. In her first play Helm has taken the advice to heart and has written a play about Laura, a journalist strongly against the Iraq war (played by Maxine Peake), married to Nick (Lloyd Owen), who is chief of staff to a prime minister called Tony (Patrick Baladi) in the run-up and aftermath of the Iraq war. Fortunately for the plot, this is a couple who don't \"have secrets at home\", and this extends to Nick allowing Laura to listen in on all his phone conversations and read all his most important government documents. Loyalty turns out to be a slippery thing, awash with hindsight and leaving no opportunity unopened to allow Laura to seize the moral high ground. If it were not for the considerable warmth of Peake's performance, Laura could well come across as a woman who likes having her cake and eating it, sticking in the knife and still hoping to emerge squeaky clean. Rather like some outdated school story, the odds are always stacked in favour of our fearless heroine as she takes on not the playground bullies but the buffoons of government and the intelligence services who sold us the mirage of weapons of mass destruction. Even so, for the first half at least, before the play opens out into a more public sphere, it is compulsively watchable. It has a journalistic brio, and is full of an insider's knowingness: Carole Caplin bans sandwiches; Tony won't take calls from Bush when he is watching The Simpsons; it is suggested Rupert Murdoch had his finger in the pie and helped nudge Blair towards war. But it is in the bedroom or the kitchen, as it charts the inner workings of a marriage under immense strain because of outside forces, that the play feels most true. At its considerable best, it is a very human account of two people caught between conflicting loyalties and constantly testing their loyalty to each other. Helm's play could, of course, be seen as an act of disloyalty in itself, but it also acts as a reminder that while soldiers and innocent Iraqi civilians who died in the conflict were the real casualties of the war, truth was a major casualty too. And when governments can't sort fact from fiction, all of us are caught up in the lies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
