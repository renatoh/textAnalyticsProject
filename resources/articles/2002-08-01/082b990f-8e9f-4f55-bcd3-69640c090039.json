There are many people in golf who think Carnoustie is the toughest course in the world; everybody else is certain of it. And for the 1999 Open Championship it was more fearsome than ever, thanks to the work of a renegade head greenskeeper, John Philp, who seemed determined to single-handedly humiliate the world's best golfers. Rich Beem insisted that his father, Larry, should come along for the adventure, kicking down over $8,000 for two business-class tickets. After six days at home following the Western Open, the Beems boarded a redeye to Glasgow, where they rendezvoused with Rich's caddie, Steve Duplantis, on the Saturday morning, five days before the start of the tournament. Duplantis had convinced Beem to follow a favourite itinerary of his previous employee, Jim Furyk: make the short drive from the airport to the town of Ayr, recover from jetlag at the luxurious, full-service Turnberry Hotel, and get acclimatised to linksland golf on its renowned Ailsa course, host to three previous Open Championships. Beem was all for it. As with other weeks, caddies must pay their own way to the Open, but recognising the extra cost, it is common for a player to pick up some of his man's other expenses. Beem had offered to pay for the expensive rental van and all of the pricey fuel, as long as Duplantis did the driving. Beem was petrified at the thought of having to drive on the wrong side of the road. Duplantis, with three previous Open Championships under his belt, enthusiastically agreed to the deal. After checking in at the hotel, Rich, Larry and Steve teed it up at the Ailsa - known as \"the Pebble Beach of Scotland\" because, like Pebble, the first 10 holes hug the coast, making for spectacular shotmaking and sweeping vistas. This was only Larry's second sojourn to the ancestral home of golf, and for both father and son it was a moving experience to stroll the linksland together. \"It was neat I was able to make that happen,\" says Rich. \"I think pride is probably a good word to describe it.\" That night Rich and Steve decided to head to a pub in town and tip a pint or two. Or three or four. \"We only had a few,\" Beem insists, \"but over there a few go a lot farther.\" By the time they stumbled out into the night, both were blotto. \"I was really intoxicated, Rich was only regularly intoxicated,\" says Duplantis, \"so he said he would drive.\" \"I took one for the team,\" says Beem. Beem and Duplantis sat in their rental van for nearly an hour in an attempt to sober up. By now it was past 2am, and time to go home. Beem pulled out of the pub's parking lot, and the second he hit the surface street, \"there were blue lights everywhere,\" says Duplantis. A couple of Ayr's finest had seen them leave the pub and had been lying in wait the whole time. \"They said they knew we were drunk by our erratic walking pattern,\" says Duplantis. Beem was taken to the police station and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Duplantis went along, but because of his condition they wouldn't release Beem in his custody. Beem wouldn't even consider waking his father, so after two hours they were finally able to talk an employee of the Turnberry Hotel into picking them up. Beem made it clear that under no circumstances was Larry to be told. The next day, Sunday, Duplantis did all the driving on the journey to Carnoustle. That afternoon Beem played his first practice round on the fearsome links. He toured it again on Monday, but then his preparation was rudely interrupted. Beem had to return to Ayr on Tuesday for a court hearing. He talked a PR rep into serving as his chauffeur and Duplantis into being his baby-sitter. Larry was still oblivious to what had happened, so Rich cooked up a story about having to play in a corporate outing and Steve, ever the obedient caddie, drove Larry down to the kingdom of Fife, on the north side of the Firth of Forth, to take him around Crail's Balcomie Links, the seventh-oldest course in the world. Beem spent eight hours in the car to go through a three-minute hearing. He was fined \u00a3450 and ordered not to drive in Scotland for 18 months (\"a blessing,\" he says). As he was leaving the courthouse, however, a Scottish reporter approached him and asked: \"Are you the Rich Beem who is playing in the Open Championship?\" Beem blew by him without saying a word, but next morning The Scotsman reported Beem's transgression for all the world to see. All except Larry, that is: he still hadn't got a whiff of the story as he arrived at Carnoustie with Rich and Steve for a Wednesday practice round. They were at the practice range when the cat nearly got out of the bag. Rich had stepped away from his hitting station for a moment when Nick Price walked by, where Duplantis and Larry were loitering. \"How much did you boys drink, anyway?\" Price asked. \"I shit a brick,\" says Duplantis. \"I walked right over to Nicky and said: 'Dude, you gotta keep it down - his dad doesn't know a thing.'\" When Rich returned Duplantis told him, sotto voce, what had happened. Beem was already spooked because he thought he had noticed a couple of reporters circling. Still, he didn't breathe a word of what had happened to Larry. It was not until Thursday, five days after the incident that Rich came clean. \"He was embarrassed, I guess,\" says Larry. \"Of course, I'm left to guess about a lot of things. He's not an alcoholic, but he's definitely got a drinking problem. It's a habit he can't break. At one time he needed it to escape. I don't think it's as important now, but it still interferes, obviously.\" After facing Larry, Rich spoke to a small group of American reporters. With a little time to reflect, he says: \"I'll say this - it was unfortunate. I'm very sorry about it, very embarrassed. Some things happened that were out of my control. It won't deter me from going back. In fact, it makes me more determined to go over there and do well in the future.\" Needless to say, it was not the ideal preparation for one's first major championship. On Thursday, paired with the 1969 champion Tony Jacklin, Beem went out in high winds and shot an 80 - which sounds abysmal until you find out the average score that day was 78.31. Sergio Garcia, playing in his first major as a professional, shot 89 and afterward was reduced to weeping in his mother's arms. On Friday, \"I fought like hell,\" says Beem. \"I didn't care about making the cut. All I wanted was to break 80.\" Though the breeze had slackened, Beem wound up shooting an 81, missing the cut by seven shots and becoming one of 57 players who failed to break 80 over the first two rounds, including defending champion Mark O'Meara and five-time winner Tom Watson. With so much carnage Beem had little trouble shrugging off his score, and even with his disasters on and off the course, tried instead to focus on the high points of his first major. \"Despite everything, it was an amazing experience,\" he says. \"Every kid should get to play in the British Open once, with his dad at their side.\" Larry had walked inside the ropes with Rich during the practice rounds and shadowed him on the range. At one point during the week, Rich was hitting balls in the middle of a group of five players, sandwiched by two generations of legends. Down the line it went Faldo, Woods, Beem, O'Meara, Jose Maria Olazabal. \"My dad was just back there shaking his head and laughing,\" he says. \"It was such an incredible sight.\" But all these good feelings went up in smoke upon Beem's return to his hometown of El Paso in Texas. Though none of the local papers had the temerity to run items about his scrape with the law, it is impossible to keep a secret in El Paso's tight-knit golf community. If Beem's drinking had in the past always been shrugged off as good clean fun or boys being boys, this time public opinion was far more sour. \"I thought Rich really tarnished everything he had accomplished,\" says John Butterworth, Beem's friend, accountant and co-sponsor. \"After the incident was made public, I had people call me from all over the country. Their reaction was the same that I had, the same all of us back at the club had. 'What a waste.' What the hell was he thinking?\" \"The whole incident was a quick, painful education about life in the public eye,\" Beem says. \"I'm not just some guy from El Paso anymore. I'm Rich Beem of the PGA Tour, winner of the Kemper Open [and now a major champion]. That changes things a little bit.\" \u00a92001 by Alan Shipnuck.
