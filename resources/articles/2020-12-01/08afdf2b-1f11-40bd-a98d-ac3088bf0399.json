The IBF, WBA and WBO belt holder faces Kubrat Pulev on Saturday and, usually, a heavyweight champion would have cut back on all forms of sparring by now, but Joshua said: \u201cThe body can get soft easy. You\u2019ve got to stay switched on, shots coming at you, gauging distance, feeling different shots. I want someone in the ring imitating Pulev. I want to spar tonight.\u201d Joshua shook his head when asked if being cooped up in a Covid bubble had left him restless and in need of a workout in the ring. \u201cNo, we\u2019ve always sparred [in the week of the fight]. We\u2019ll be in a hotel somewhere and we will call one of the local gyms. It\u2019s important to have someone beside you who can push you. It\u2019s good for preparation. \u201cI have never had a problem with sparring with anyone getting stuck in. That\u2019s been the best way and what I\u2019ve learned from [the former world champion] Wladimir Klitschko, which is the value of getting all the best talent into one space to challenge me as champion. Four rounds with one, four rounds with another one. I\u2019ve been out for a year and they\u2019ve got me tough. They\u2019ve got me ready.\u201d Eddie Hearn, his promoter, looked briefly alarmed when Joshua casually mentioned he had been in the ring without a headguard on Wednesday night. \u201cWe did eight rounds, six with the head guard and two without,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cRob McCracken [his trainer] didn\u2019t like it. But I know what works for me and Rob manages it. We work together. I could hit the pads, but they don\u2019t hit back. The heavy bag doesn\u2019t move. \u201cHaving a live opponent in front of you, moving your legs, becomes second nature. The best thing I can do is to do what I need to replicate on Saturday. The ring here [in the hotel] is tiny so I\u2019m going to get into the ring on Saturday and have loads of space to do my job. These things are important.\u201d McCracken has trained Joshua since he was an amateur who went on to win gold at London 2012. He made an important point when asked about Joshua taking his headguard off during sparring. \u201cIt\u2019s for the tippy-tappy stuff,\u201d he stressed. \u201cWhen you do the open sparring the headguard\u2019s got to stay on.\u201d McCracken is too considered a man to allow Joshua to take any unnecessary risks in the ring this close to a title fight and he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not sparring as you think, it\u2019s technical, touch stuff. Just to get his coordination and eye in.\u201d Joshua learned some valuable lessons from Klitschko, who defeated Pulev in a world title defence in 2014 \u2013 when Joshua also sparred with Klitschko. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how the universe works. I was in a camp with Wladimir and then I fought him [in 2017]. At the time I didn\u2019t really understand the implications of the way Wladimir was training [for Pulev], but I have actually implemented some of the stuff he did in my training for this camp.\u201d Did he learn any specific lessons which will help him beat Pulev? \u201cDefinitely. Klitschko was like a heavyweight factory. He invited every heavyweight to his training camp.\u201d Joshua has been an intriguing mix this week of quiet edginess and amiable good cheer. The waiting is almost over and it seems as if his relatively unconventional if gentle sparring in these last nights of preparation has helped him. But he knows that the dangerous and deeply serious work awaits on Saturday.
