But if waving a plastic union flag towards an unelected head of state isn't really your thing, there's an alternative jubilee jamboree just a mile or so downstream. For their second party of the year, Secretsundaze have secured one of their favourite al fresco venues, the House And Terrace in Greenwich. On the decks, they welcome a bona fide house music legend in the form of Chicago's Lil Louis. Not to be confused with Master At Works' Little Louie Vega (although the two have collaborated), this particularly Louis is the man behind 80s club hits I Called U and French Kiss (you know, the one where the lady sounds like she's getting rather more than a quick snog). Sets from Joy Orbison and Sheffield techno head Nyra should provide a nice contrast. And we can thank Her Maj for two whole days' recovery afterwards. The House And Terrace, SE10, Sun Sam Richards Technique &amp; Asylum Garden Party, Leeds Ten years is more than long enough to run any club night. After a decade of parties, which ran every fortnight on alternate Saturdays in Asylum at the Mint club, Technique ceased, and promoter-DJ David Martin moved on to start the club Modern Amusement. However, Technique's all-day Sunday parties at popular student pub The Faversham were so beloved that they've continued to happen each bank holiday. What began as a boozy residents session has now morphed into something more like a mini-festival with international guests, food stalls and music on the outdoor terrace and in marquees during daylight hours. After 10pm, it all moves indoors where three rooms of house and techno will entertain until 4am. Guests for this year's second party include John Talabot, Roman Fl\u00fcgel and Metro Area's Darshan Jesrani, with locals Mono_cult, PBR Streetgang, Butter Side Up and A Rave Called Sharon also involved. The Faversham, Springield Mount, Sun Marc Rowlands Love Saves The Day, Bristol Glastonbury might be taking a well-earned year out but it's nice to see some of the organisers keeping busy. Tomorrow, the Wow! team from the festival's Dance Village present Love Saves The Day. It's a one-day greenfield event in central Bristol with a sizzling lineup. This includes Radio 1's Annie Mac, grime's name du jour Joy Orbison, Ninja Tune genius Bonobo, UK house maestro Maya Jane Coles, and live hip-hop turntablists Foreign Beggars. Expect live sets from Roots Manuva, Soom T and Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs plus home town interest including reggae veteran DJ Derek and funk outfit Babyhead. If that's not enough, there are no less than four afterparties at Motion, Lakota, Blue Mountain and the Big Chill Bar. Castle Park, Sun John Mitchell Barrio 54, Belfast Derry music and arts collective Bounce makes one of its occasional forays to Belfast, bringing with it a South American-flavoured fusion of live musicians, MCs and DJs. Tonight's Latin Disco Summer Special showcase delivers an authentic Buenos Aires-by-way-of-a-circa-1976-Bronx-inspired vibe, led by musician, producer and Ronnie Scott's regular Kaidi Tatham's live flute, keyboard and improvised percussion. Homespun's Plan B, Bounce regular Andy Funk and the club's founder KwaMe fill the gaps between live acts with heavy Afrobeats, Latin and disco, while MC Leroy Culture showcases his MC skills and spins some Jamaican dancehall blasters. The Menagerie, University Street, Sat Patric Baird Field Day Afterparties, London Despite having to cancel the main aftershow due to licensing problems, there are still two great official parties after this year's Field Day. At the Waiting Room, German deep house auteur Kassem Mosse plays alongside Trilogy Tapes' Will Bankhead. Then at XOYO, there's Modeselektor's 50 Weapons label with Berlin producer Phon.O and future garage fellas Dark Sky.
