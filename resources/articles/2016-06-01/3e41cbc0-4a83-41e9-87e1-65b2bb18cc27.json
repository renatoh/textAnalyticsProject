The president on Friday joined a T-shirt-clad Mark Zuckerberg and several young startup founders on stage at Stanford University for a White House entrepreneurship conference. The administration has been holding such events to persuade young people overseas to join startups instead of extremist groups. \u201cYou represent all of the upside of an interconnected world,\u201d Obama told the audience, after chiding Zuckerberg for his wardrobe choices. \u201cYesterday\u2019s vote speaks to the ongoing changes and challenges related to globalization ... cultures are colliding. Sometimes that\u2019s disruptive and people get worried.\u201d Friday also offered the latest example of how Washington increasingly views whatever is in the water in Silicon Valley as a potential cure-all for the world\u2019s ailments. If other countries can engender their own technology boom, the administration seems to say, it could help crises like global development, the Islamic State, immigration and the Brexit vote. For Obama, some of this appears to be out of a genuine fascination with companies born in San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area. At one point, for instance, he lauded Stanford for making \u201cnerd cool\u201d and being the birthplace of both Google and Yahoo. \u201cThose were really good student projects,\u201d he said after pausing for dramatic effect. \u201cMy student projects weren\u2019t as good.\u201d On stage, Obama was also joined by Mai Medhat from Egypt, Jean Bosco from Rwanda and Mariana Costa Checa from Lima \u2013 all young startup founders. \u201cI\u2019m still just trying to get over the fact you introduced me,\u201d Costa Checa said. The president and the Facebook CEO encouraged the audience to build causes, rather than just profit-seek companies. Zuckerberg, for instance, said the driving force behind Facebook was to connect as many people as possible. This, he said, is why his company has tried to expand internet access in India and Africa. Zuckerberg, though, did acknowledge that bringing more people online may eventually mean more money for Facebook \u2013 but not for a \u201cvery long time if it works out\u201d. There are other parts of the startup lifestyle of which the president appeared envious. \u201cI could not wear a T-shirt like Mark for at least another six months,\u201d Obama said, referring to when he\u2019ll be out of office. To which Zuckerberg responded: \u201cSoon.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
