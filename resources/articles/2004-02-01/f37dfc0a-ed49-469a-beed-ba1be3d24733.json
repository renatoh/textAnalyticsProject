It shows John Kerry eight points ahead of him in the race for the White House - with 51% of Americans set to back the senator if he wins the Democratic nomination as expected, and only 43% behind the president. Mr Bush can take comfort, however, from the figures showing his support to be harder than Mr Kerry's. Only 59% of the challenger's backers describe their support as strong, while 83% of the president's do. But the poll contain further bad news for Mr Bush, revealing that his job approval rating has dropped to 50%, a career low. On key domestic issues Mr Bush's figures are also down. 57% disapprove of his record on creating jobs, 54% his economic management and 62% his efforts on health. Mr Kerry leads the president on all these issues. There is also bad news on foreign affairs. Some 64% of Americans still approve of the president's handling of the \"war on terror\", but 50% of them now think the war in Iraq was not worth fighting. Some 54% also believe that Mr Bush's administration either lied of deliberated exaggerated evidence that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction in order to justify war. This is reflected in a drop in the number of Americans who think he is honest and trustworthy. Only 52% believe he is now, compared to 70% at the end of last year.
