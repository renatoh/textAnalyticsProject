Fiorina supporters had been pressuring the network for weeks to alter its criteria for admission, which were not friendly to her relatively recent strength in the polls. Over the course of August, Fiorina moved from near the bottom of the pack of 17 candidates to among the top five candidates in polling averages. The new rules also mean the debate stage is likely to hold more than 10 candidates \u2013 a group size already viewed as large. Fox News hosted 10 candidates for a main Republican debate on 6 August and held a separate, smaller debate for the rest of the field. The network cited a lack of new polling since the first debate for the rules change. \u201cWe learned this week that there will likely be only two more polls by the deadline of September 10th,\u201d CNN said in a statement. \u201cIn a world where we expected there to be at least 15 national polls, based on historic precedent, it appears there will be only five. As a result, we now believe we should adjust the criteria to ensure the next debate best reflects the most current state of the national race.\u201d Last week, the network claimed it would be illegal to change the rules. \u201cFederal Election Commission guidelines make it clear that these criteria cannot be changed after they have been published,\u201d a CNN spokesperson said on 26 August. The Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, welcomed the decision. \u201cI applaud CNN for recognizing the historic nature of this debate and fully support the network\u2019s decision to amend their criteria,\u201d he said in a statement. CNN originally said it would take the top 10 candidates based on national polling going back to 16 July. On Tuesday, the network announced it would take that batch, plus anyone who had broken into the top 10 based on polling going only back to the first debate. The use of two sets of top 10s could mean that both the Kentucky senator Rand Paul and New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, would appear on the debate stage, although they are currently locked in a battle for 10th in national polls. Before Fiorina\u2019s rise, they were both inside the top 10. Candidates left out in every case, should current polling hold, include Rick Perry, Rick Santorum and Bobby Jindal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
