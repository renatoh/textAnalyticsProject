It is unlikely - no, impossible - that you will come across a more diverting 75 minutes on the fringe or a more audacious directing debut than this from 20-year-old Jamie Lloyd. This may be a student production but it is coolly professional. March of the Falsettos, the second part of William Finn and James Lapine's chamber musical trilogy, proved too challenging for the West End over 10 years ago. Now in this bravura production Lloyd offers us the chance to see the final part of the story about New York Jewish straight guy Marvin who realises that he is gay and leaves his wife and son Jason for his lover. Falsettoland opens with Jason's bar mitzvah approaching and Marvin realising that \"it's time to grow up and face the music\". It is not just growing up but also growing old in the era of Aids that proves difficult. But what could be mawkish turns out to be intensely moving, and what could just be camp turns out to contain real wit. Lloyd and his terrific cast not only get it absolutely right in walking the tightrope between the comic and the serious, but actually embellish the humour and so deepen the pain of the scenario. This is a vibrant, intelligent and intensely likable piece of theatre. Mark my words, Lloyd is a future star of musical theatre. Until August 27. Box office: 0131-556 6550.
