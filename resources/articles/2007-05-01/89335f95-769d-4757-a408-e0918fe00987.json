By the time the first march in LA got underway, an hour and a half later than scheduled, the network had moved on to Mujer ... Casos de la Vida Real, a culebr\u00f3n guaranteed to divert even the most motivated of immigration activists. The first anniversary of the immigrants' rights marches of last year has proved somewhat underwhelming. A year ago, against all expectations, millions of Latinos and others gathered across the country to march, wave flags of all stripes, and proclaim their opposition to harsh immigration legislation proposed by James Sensenbrenner and his little lamented HR 4437. It was a startling, celebratory event, a day for the fulfilling of clich\u00e9s: not only was the beast awoken, but light was cast on the darkness and figures crept out of the shadows. This year it is different. The hundreds of thousands have been reduced to hundreds and thousands. Where Los Angeles recorded somewhere between 500,000 and a million marchers last year, this year it is somewhere in the region of 6,000 to 20,000. A multitude of explanations are offered to explain this year's numbers. There is no Sensenbrenner to galvanise the apathetic. School students, a significant constituency last year both for their presence and for their role in raising awareness of the protests, have been intimidated into staying in the classroom. Many undocumented workers have been cowed by stepped up immigration raids on employers, and are less prepared to flout the wishes of their employers and forego a day's work (and wages) for the pleasure of marching. Potential marchers have also seen the debate - and the strategy - muddied by divisions over how to move forward, a predictable outcome of any political success. With Sensenbrenner forgotten, immigration activists on both sides are preparing to do battle over the snappily titled Security Through Regularized Immigration and Vibrant Economy Act, better known as Strive. The bipartisan proposal offers the undocumented six years of temporary legal status - at a price - but has at the end of that a procedure dubbed \"touchback\", under which applicants must return to their home country to obtain US citizenship. The proposal has split immigrants' rights groups, eager but unsure how to spend the political capital they accrued a year ago. Some look to the newly-empowered Democrats and are prepared to do nothing now in the hope that a successful Democratic presidential candidate will fulfil his or her campaign promises and deliver robust immigration reform - and a path to citizenship - in 2009. That strategy is a continuation of last year's declaration that \"Hoy marchamos, ma\u00f1ana votamos\", a promise that remained unfulfilled in last November's mid-term election. It is a strategy not without risks. Despite assuming power, the Democratic leadership has been reluctant to enter the immigration fray, much as the party and its candidate avoided the subject in 2004. Another take on this year's protests is that the marchers stayed at home because they have won the battle. Advanced by sources as diverse as Fox News pundits and Gustavo Arellano, author of the spoofy Ask a Mexican column, this thesis has it that the demonstrations and elections of last year have sufficiently changed the political landscape for immigration reform that the disenfranchised can afford to stay at home. \"La lucha,\" wrote Arellano in the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday, \"is almost over.\" \"Last year there was something against us,\" Jorge Mario Cabrera, an organiser with CARECEN, one of the groups behind one of Tuesday's Los Angeles marches, told La Opini\u00f3n. \"Now we're in favour of reform and that there be recognition of the contribution\" immigrants make to the economy. Like all else, immigration reform seems destined to bob along in the wake of the electoral calendar. The Republican agenda has moved to the right as the campaign has sputtered into half-life. The president, while avowedly a border man who understands the problems and wants \"comprehensive immigration reform\", won't touch anything that doesn't have Republican support. Similarly, the Democrats will be wary of becoming too wedded to a solution that might alienate the centre. Perhaps the marchers should take a total break next year, and return on May 1, 2009. Then something really could happen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
