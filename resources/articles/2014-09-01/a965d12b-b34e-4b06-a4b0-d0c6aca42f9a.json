Ronaldo has continually spoken of his enduring affection for United after leaving the club in 2009 in a \u00a380m transfer to the Spanish giants. Of bringing Ronaldo back to Old Trafford, Van Gaal said: \u201cWhen it is possible, what I said with [Radamel] Falcao, players like Ronaldo give a lot extra to selection or to a team but I don\u2019t think Real Madrid shall sell him.\u201d The former Real president, Ram\u00f3n Calderd\u00f3n, claimed this week that Ronaldo was disillusioned with the current incumbent, Florentino P\u00e9rez. \u201cMy impression is he is fed up with the policy of the current president,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen he came with [Arjen] Robben, he thought he would be a good colleague for him in the team. [Gonzalo] Higua\u00edn was sold and he didn\u2019t like that. Last year he thought it was a mistake to let [Mesut] \u00d6zil leave and the last straw was selling Xabi Alonso and \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda this summer.\u201d The current World Player of the Year, now 29, hinted last month he would be interested in moving back to his former club. \u201cI love Manchester and you never know in football. Of course I\u2019m happy at Real Madrid; it\u2019s my home, it\u2019s my club, but United treated me unbelievably, so you never know,\u201d Ronaldo told MUTV before United played Real Madrid during their tour of the United States of America. \u201cI am still in contact with some people there because I had a good relationship with everybody \u2013 it was like my second family.\u201d Ahead of United\u2019s game at Leicester on Sunday, Van Gaal said his injury list had eased. \u201cI have only six injuries now, [Chris] Smalling is back,\u201d he said. He denied that Falcao\u2019s arrival threatened Robin van Persie, who has yet to score this term. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Falcao interferes with Van Persie or Van Persie interfes with Falaco. \u201cFalcao is a very good striker but I said in the first press conference I like Van Persie also. He\u2019s also a very good striker and we also have [Wayne] Rooney, [Adnan] Januzaj and [James] Wilson. We have five players for the two strikers\u2019 positions and I have to choose.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
