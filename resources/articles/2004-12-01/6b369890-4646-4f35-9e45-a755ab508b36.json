All I have to show for the \u00a3100 that I have spent in Oslo so far is two nights in a hostel dormitory, a small collection of bus tickets, and a full stomach after eating a reindeer hotdog from the Seven Eleven store. Each Baltic city came as a surprise to me; they all know how to embrace capitalism on a large and exploitative scale. Looking through the 'In Your Pocket' guide to the Baltic cities you may be led to believe, as I was, that all three cities have little to offer other than a wide variety of strip clubs, alcohol (vodka) shops, and 24 hour casinos, but this turned out not to be the case. The adult entertainment industry is a lucrative industry in this part of Europe, so much so, that Tallinn has created a name for itself as the latest and best stag night destination. The locals fear a surge in British tourists coming for wild weekends, and far from welcome easyJet's interest in the city. A tour of the three capitals leaves me to conclude that Tallinn has an undeserved reputation. The beer-guzzling, sex-seeking, British tourist looking for somewhere cheap is better off visiting Riga or Vilnius where strip clubs are plentiful, casinos are open all night long and beer and vodka cost less than coke. I saw too much of Tallinn and not enough of Riga or Vilnius. The Spanish girls, B\u00e9a and Estrella who I met in Vilnius' Old Town Hostel were such great company that I ended up spending almost a whole week with them. My short encounter with Vilnius left me with an unfortunate lasting impression: if you do visit the Old Town Hostel, try to avoid reading through their guest book, or you may be hesitant to go out on your own in fear of a violent robbery or unprovoked assault. I spent a number of hours with B\u00e9'a and Estrella walking around in subzero temperatures and waiting for the city to impress us, which it didn't, so we visited the tourist information. The staff at the tourist information office inside the town hall told us that we should walk around some more, so we did. If you want to be impressed by Vilnius, it's probably best that you don't take their advice. Or you may only return with stories of clapped out police cars painted with \"go faster stripes\", a giant inflatable Father Christmas standing outside the Town Hall and hordes of people walking in and out of Russian Orthodox churches as if they're attending a state funeral. The bus from Vilnius to Riga was fully booked, so the girls and I settled for a night bus back to Tallinn. This slow and torturous journey, and the following leg on to Riga in a Russia-bound, vodka-fuelled bus, left me grateful to be travelling, for the most part, by plane. I made it to Riga alone and safely enough to share my experiences with the same handful of travellers that I met in Vilnius a few nights earlier. I had only 24 hours in Riga, and only a few hours of daylight in which to admire the city for all its beauty, past and present, before flying out of RIX, their newly rebuilt airport. Ashling, an Irish girl, told me all about her very different and somewhat psychedelic experience of Vilnius. In search of Uzupio, a small district of bohemians who'll stamp your passport and enforce their own laws on April 1 each year, she ended up spending her nights in a bar with snakes, lizards, and sharks swimming around a tree growing in a pond! Or so she told me. I clearly misjudged Vilnius. I followed a suggested walking itinerary around Riga and just about crammed in most of the key sights before the sun disappeared at 3pm. Riga has a particularly beautiful parkland area and river that runs to the east of the Old Town, a ferocious and polluted wide river to the west and an eclectic mix of art nouveau buildings on Elizabetes Iela - all of which can only be appreciated under five layers of winter clothing. Aside from all the things I didn't get to see, I must return to Latvia with friends, if only to hire a limousine for \u00a317 and live it up in Riga's glitzy nightlife, or simply to rent a Jacuzzi in the woods and relax by a lake. I left Riga and the Baltics on an inaugural easyJet flight to Berlin. It seems English is the new German, and as for Latvian, well they have to learn English to understand the safety demonstrations. I will be returning to Berlin for New Years Eve so I wasn't too disappointed to have only four hours in the city before returning to the airport for another cheap flight to Oslo, via London. A rush around Berlin led me up to the top of the Victory Tower on the advice of easyJet's in-flight literature - a cheap alternative to the television tower for a great view and a good way to see the city in a rush. What little I got to see of Berlin left me feeling like a field mouse lost inside a concrete jungle, I couldn't even find out how to see what remains of the Berlin Wall, and frankly was too embarrassed to ask. I will be returning at 6pm on New Year's Eve, alone! Any urbanites from Berlin who care to show me a New Years Eve to remember should drop me an email, hopefully I wont see 2005 in, lost, alone, and bewildered. The last two weeks have resulted in a number of strange encounters. A guy who insisted on waking me up each morning for breakfast vodka, no matter how many times I refused. Two drunken people at Vilnius' bus station whose broken English meant that I couldn't work out if they were trying to rob me, or make friends with me. A man who had almost finished his two and a half year cycling holiday around the world, making me feel like a pompous yuppie with a rucksack. And one with ticket inspectors on Berlin's S Bahn, resulting in a \u20ac40 fine, the equivalent of four flights! For reasons I can't explain, I planned to spend a large period of time in Stockholm, so if any readers can suggest how to inexpensively stay in or near the city, that would be great. A place to stay in Lulea would also be helpful along with Copenhagen and Helsinki. Any good suggestions of hostels are always worth hearing about along with ideas for worthwhile day trips and psychedelic nights. This week Nick took these flights: Tallinn-Vilnius, Estonia Air, approximately \u00a330; Riga-Berlin, easyJet, \u20ac20.49; Berlin-Luton, easyJet, \u20ac26.99; Stansted-Oslo, Ryanair, \u00a321.92"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
