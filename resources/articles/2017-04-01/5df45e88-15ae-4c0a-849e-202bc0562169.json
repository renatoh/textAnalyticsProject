The England international sustained the problem during final preparations for Liverpool\u2019s game against Crystal Palace on Sunday and the club are unsure when he will next be available for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team. Sturridge was out of action for two months with the initial injury, returning only for the recent Premier League wins at Stoke City and West Bromwich Albion, where he appeared as a second-half substitute in both fixtures. The 27-year-old, whose Anfield career has been blighted by fitness problems, has started only five league games for Liverpool this season, with Klopp favouring a front three of Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Man\u00e9. Sturridge is likely to be allowed to leave Liverpool at the end of this season and could therefore have played his final game should he require another lengthy recovery period."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
