The Institute of Directors \u2013 one of the UK\u2019s employers\u2019 groups \u2013 said its members had so far failed to take advantage of the seven-month delay to Brexit and warned that companies should not put faith in politicians to produce an agreement. The IoD produced figures that showed less than half of businesses had Brexit plans, and said firms should be considering all reasonable preparations for no deal. Some Tory candidates for prime minister \u2013 including the frontrunner, Boris Johnson \u2013 have said they would be prepared to leave the EU without a deal but an IoD survey of almost 1,000 companies found the proportion that had activated contingency plans between January and April rose from 18% to only 23%. Only 4% of those questioned said they would be using the extension period to pick up the pace. Edwin Morgan, the IoD\u2019s interim director general, said: \u201cThis week\u2019s vote won\u2019t be the last twist in the Brexit saga but it made clear how real the possibility of no deal is. Business can have no absolute reassurance that an agreement will be reached, particularly given the commitment of some Conservative leadership candidates to leaving the EU in October, with or without a deal. It feels like the extension is at risk of being wasted.\u201d The IoD said there had been very limited financial support from central government for small businesses to prepare, despite repeated calls from the employers\u2019 group for Brexit planning vouchers to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) receive professional help for complex trade and legal issues. Morgan said that getting a deal would be \u201cby some distance\u201d the better outcome, adding that it would prolong the uncertainty if Britain had to trade with the EU on the same World Trade Organization terms as countries such as China and the US. \u201cIf businesses can\u2019t have faith in politicians that means they have to look out for themselves. With business costs rising in many quarters, and management time precious, it\u2019s understandable that firms don\u2019t want to put resources towards preparing for something we still hope won\u2019t happen. But the risk of no deal is very real and so we\u2019d urge all businesses, if they haven\u2019t done so already, to carefully consider their exposure and draw up mitigation plans now.\u201d Speaking on Thursday, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, said it was harder for supermarkets to prepare for a no-deal exit from the EU in October than it was in March because they will be storing more products for Halloween and Christmas in their warehouses, leaving limited space for Brexit stockpiles. \u201cOctober will be much more challenging than March was,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be coming out of Halloween and building stock for the Christmas peak, so the capacity in the supply chain will be much more challenging. It\u2019s about sheer physical capacity. It\u2019s not just the availability \u2013 it\u2019ll be the space.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
