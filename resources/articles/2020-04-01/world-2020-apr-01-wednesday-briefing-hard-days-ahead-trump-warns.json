This is Martin Farrer bringing you all the news you need this Wednesday morning. Donald Trump has warned Americans to brace for a \u201cvery, very painful two weeks\u201d after he said that up to 240,000 people could die in the US \u2013 and keeping deaths to that number depended on people observing social distancing. In an unusually sombre White House media briefing overnight, the US president said the country had to be prepared for \u201cthe hard days that lie ahead\u201d as the death toll from coronavirus passed 3,800. The worst-case scenario, where rules were not followed, could see up to 2.2 million people die. The death toll in Britain climbed by 381 to 1,789 yesterday, and included the youngest victim so far \u2013 a 13-year-old boy from south London who was reported as having no underlying health issues. However, NHS officials offered some hope that the nationwide lockdown might be having some impact because there had been a \u201cbit of a plateau\u201d in the number of people testing positive for coronavirus. The government is under renewed pressure to improve Britain\u2019s testing rates, which are still well short of the 10,000-a-day target. Britain\u2019s care homes are at risk of being overrun by the virus and staff say they are at breaking point, according to the country\u2019s biggest charitable provider. MHA, which runs more than 220 facilities, said more than one in 10 staff were unable to work because they were sick or in self-isolation. NHS staff have been warned not to voice concerns about a lack of protective personal equipment, a doctors\u2019 group has claimed. Workers have been sent threatening emails and told they could face disciplinary action if they don\u2019t keep concerns private. Police chiefs have reissued guidance about how officers should enforce lockdown rules after reports of heavy-handed interventions such as road checkpoints. More than 40,000 people have died from Covid-19 around the world and 855,000 have been infected. Here is our latest at-a-glance summary and we will have all the developments throughout the day on our coronavirus live blog. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Banks\u2019 buffer \u2013 Britain\u2019s big banks will abandon plans to return nearly \u00a38bn worth of dividends to shareholders as they seek to build a financial buffer in order to weather the coming economic downturn. The Bank of England has also ordered lenders to cancel plans for cash bonuses for executives. The cancellation of the 2019 dividends will give the banks additional funds they can use to increase lending to businesses and households during the Covid-19 lockdown. Another economic consequence of Covid-19 could see the government scrap plans to increase the national living wage to two-thirds of average earnings by 2024, the Low Pay Commission warned. * * * Opencast verdict \u2013 Ministers will decide next week whether to give the green light for the UK\u2019s largest coalmine after years of fierce opposition from environmentalists. The verdict on the Highthorn opencast mine near the Northumberland beauty spot of Druridge Bay will be made by next Tuesday, according to a letter from government lawyers seen by the Guardian. The developer, Banks Group, which wants to mine three million tonnes of coal at the site, told ministers the mine was \u201cvital\u201d because the coronavirus crisis could lead to a fall in coal imports. * * * Wings clipped \u2013 Nightingales have had their wings clipped by the climate crisis, scientists have discovered, and more of the birds are choosing not to make their epic 7,000-mile annual migration every year between Africa and Europe. A study in Spain shows that the average wing length relative to their body size has fallen over the past two decades because summer droughts are driving a range of genetic changes including laying fewer eggs and smaller clutch size. Coronavirus Extra Chinese officials fear a growing number of asymptomatic carriers of the virus could spread a second wave of infections. US authorities are also concerned about the \u201csilent\u201d threat. Italian defiance in the early stages of the outbreak, which saw people singing from balconies to keep spirits up, is giving way to fears about running short of food and money, especially in the south. Teargas, beatings and bleach are among the methods meted out by police to enforce lockdowns on populations all over the world, with poor people receiving the harshest treatment. The captain of the US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt has pleaded with navy chiefs for help after an outbreak of coronavirus on board the huge vessel docked in Guam. Rafael Behr argues that the virus has not just bumped Brexit down the political agenda, but made the whole project look \u201cparochial and self-indulgent\u201d. Today in Focus podcast The lockdown across the world has led people to desperately seek out new tools for maintaining their work and social lives online such as Houseparty and Zoom. But UK technology editor Alex Hern argues he\u2019s been living this way for years. Lunchtime read: Nick Grimshaw: \u2018I\u2019ve had horrible anxiety\u2019 The Radio One DJ Nick Grimshaw discusses his near-death experience in the Namibian desert while filming Sport Relief, dealing with anxiety, why he always wanted to present the Breakfast Show (\u201cI never listened to anything else\u201d), the paparazzi and the devastating death of his friend Caroline Flack. \u201cShe was so funny, engaging and open,\u201d he says.

Business The FTSE100 yesterday posted its biggest quarterly fall since Black Monday more than 30 years ago, and the index is in for more of the same today after Asian markets slumped overnight. The catalyst was poor manufacturing figures from several countries in the region. The FTSE is on course for a drop of 2% today. The pound is buying $1.238 and \u20ac1.123.
