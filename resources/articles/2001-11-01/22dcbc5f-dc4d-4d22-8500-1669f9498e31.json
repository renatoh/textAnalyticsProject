When the bill got its second reading after a stormy six-hour Commons debate, the government got a 458-5 vote majority, with four Labour MPs and one Tory - former cabinet minister John Gummer - voting No, backed by two Tory tellers, Douglas Hogg and Richard Shepherd. But when the motion to subject detailed debate on the bill to a tight timetable - completed by next Monday - was voted on, 74 MPs demanded extra time. The four Labour rebels, George Galloway, Paul Marsden, Brian Sedgemore and Jeremy Corbyn, were joined by Bob Marshall-Andrews, Neil Gerrard, Kevin McNamara and Dr Lynne Jones, plus one other. Under a hail of criticism in both Lords and Commons, Mr Blunkett had earlier endured his most gruelling parliamentary session since becoming a minister. In frustration he said he despaired at the inability of some people to remember the scale of the threat posed by the September 11 terrorist attacks. But the measures were criticised as going too far and being too wide by the chairman of the home affairs select committee, Chris Mullin, and his predecessor Lord Corbett. Although the Labour majority will ensure that the wide-ranging bill is quickly passed by MPs, the measures face a difficult ride in the Lords. Peers sent a warning shot yesterday when the Liberal Democrats voted against a derogation, or opting out, from the European convention on human rights and the Conservatives abstained. A derogation would let the government detain suspected foreign terrorists without trial: the most controversial of the 120 clauses in the bill. In his first, as yet minor, concessions yesterday Mr Blunkett promised to amend the bill so that he would only arrest suspected terrorists if his suspicion was based on reasonable grounds. He also promised that aspects of the bill would fall after five years, and promised to make the Ministry of Defence police subject to normal complaints procedures. But he will come under pressure to concede a full judicial review of any detention decision, and to drop clauses unrelated to terrorism, including proposals for an offence of inciting religious hatred and allowing public bodies to disclose information to each other in criminal investigations. During a 70-minute speech in the Commons, Mr Blunkett had to wait 40 minutes before a Labour MP - Kevin Hughes - came to his defence. Mr Hughes asked: \"Don't you find it bizarre, like I do, that the yoghurt-eating, muesli-eating, Guardian-reading fraternity are only too happy to want to protect the human rights of people who engage in terrorist acts but never once do they talk about the human rights of those affected by those terrorist acts?\" Mr Blunkett hit out at his media critics, saying the most difficult decision some of them ever faced was what to buy at Sainsbury's. He insisted that the bill was necessary because the terrorist threat has increased dramatically since September 11: \"they have declared that it is open season on all of us\". But Lord Corbett, a former chairman of the home affairs select committee, said the new powers smacked of \"the worst aspects of the Soviet Union and other repressive states\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
