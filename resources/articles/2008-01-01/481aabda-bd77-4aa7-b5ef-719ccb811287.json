Kries are an original Croatian band who set out to take the process to its limits, throwing in so many influences that each song is a surprise. Their starting point is the folk music and wedding songs of Croatia's villages, and the band play traditional instruments including local bagpipes made from goatskins, wooden flutes, and the small lijerica \"knee violin\". But then there are a couple of impressive percussionists, playing anything from a conventional kit to hand drums, and there's bass, electric guitar and delicate violin work from their Scottish producer, Martin Swan. Kries are led by a singer who deserves to be a new European celebrity. Mojmir Novakovic is tall and thin; he sports long hair and a traditional sash around his waist, and speaks enough English to demonstrate a fine sense of humour. He apologised because the band were exhausted after all-night sessions in Glasgow, following their appearance at Celtic Connections, but then led them through a lengthy set that veered from sensitive and stirring ballads to a frantic post-punk thrash - and for the most part, it worked. He started by showing his expertise as a traditional singer, helped by sturdy harmony work from his colleagues, then hypnotic percussion kicked in as the band switched from stirring bagpipe and violin workouts to gentle, mournful ballads and furious guitar passages, with the theatrical Novakovic falling to his knees like a male Adriatic answer to Patti Smith. At times it seemed Kries would topple over in their exuberant rush to change direction repeatedly, but no matter. This is a band to watch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
