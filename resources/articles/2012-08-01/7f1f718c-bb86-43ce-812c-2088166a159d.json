His fifth album of original material \u2013 and his first for four years \u2013 rolls by like a river, all finger-picked guitars and delicate arrangements, and atop it all Yorkston's tremulous voice, quavering through lyrics that are poetic in intent but often just too dense to parse. I Can Take All This, for example, manages to cram 600 words into three minutes: this is not a man who lives by the maxim: \"Don't bore us, get to the chorus.\" Sometimes the phrasemaking is devastatingly simple \u2013 \"I am slow at crossing borders/ But once there I try to offer unconditional love,\" he sings on Two \u2013 but often it whispers by without sinking in its claws, and you think: just slow down, and speak up. But if he did, would he still be James Yorkston?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
