Due to a legal wrangle with a set of fictional characters, he has fled the country and speaks to us only via a videotape sent from some tropical-looking location. It is in fact Tenerife. Stuart David not being with us is the first of several bits of postmodern tomfoolery in a half-hour send-up of the conventional author event. For that is what this is billed as: David, former Belle and Sebastian bass player, \"discussing\" his new novel, The Peacock Manifesto. Instead, Peacock Johnson - the novel's protagonist - appears, with his lush wife, Bev, and his business partner, the hairnet-sporting, glue-sniffing Evil Bob. They tell tales of their Stateside escapades and their vain and hilarious attempts to make a dance record out of Glen Campbell's Rhinestone Cowboy. Just to illustrate the potential of this idea they play the original, while Peacock and Bob form a human beatbox. It sounds dire, mad; shoppers on other levels of the book shop stop what they are doing and stare. Only one paragraph is read out, and that's Bev checking the description of herself as \"loony\" and perennially addled by \"nuclear cocktails\". The idea isn't to sell the book: instead, the characters want it known that Stuart David has stolen their story and, especially, Peacock's words. They are here to start a campaign (stickers are handed round for placing on all copies of the book) to let David know publicly that he has a fight on his hands. It's a ploy that works well to mirror the atmosphere of the new book - slight, fast and funny. It helps, of course, that the large, young audience, clad in art school chic, adore David, both from his Belle and Sebastian days and his involvement with Looper. They are only too happy to play along with the joke, not mentioning the fact that Peacock, in his chunky gold jewellery, yellow golfing trousers and tight sweater, is in fact David. When it is time for questions from the crowd, you just know they're not going to ask earnestly what inspires him as a writer, or when he first put pen to paper. A brave boy asks: \"Is it true that Stuart David smells of wee?\" and the crowd erupts. Peacock Johnson, though, doesn't smile."}, "isHosted": false}}}
