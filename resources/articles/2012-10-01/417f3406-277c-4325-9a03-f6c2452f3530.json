EastEnders. I watch it Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and I used to do the Sunday omnibus, but they've moved that to a mad time on Friday night. My favourite character of all time is probably Stacey Slater. Or Lauren. Or Afia. Box set? I've watched all of Sons Of Anarchy, and I'm waiting for series five. It's about a motorcycle gang. Really good. You need to watch that. I watched it in about a week. Night and day, bro. You know, when I get like that I watch one after the other, like a child! My favourite comedian is Michael McIntyre. I've got his ones on DVD. He's really funny, and he's the most current with his jokes. The life I lead, he sort of knows. He knows about the London Underground, do you know what I mean? He's got the craziest, the best observations. Still on the DVR? I keep meaning to watch Oz. I need to get my eyes wrapped round that properly. Bring back \u2026 I was looking in the paper the other day and I saw the new Dallas. Wow. When I was a kid I watched Dallas religiously, not because I wanted to but because my mum and my nan always had it on the screen. I remember everything that went on: Bobby, Sue Ellen. How crazy is that? It was a programme that made me dream. In his bedroom, the kid [John Ross Ewing] used to have a race car bed, and I'd say, \"I want a race car bed.\" Dallas was sick. Mastermind specialist subject? Not sport. I'd probably do it about, flipping \u2026 someone like the Beatles or something. Come Dine With Me lineup? Would I have to cook food or something? What's William's wife called? Middleton? I'd have a bit of Kate Middleton. I think she's really cool. She's really normal, no matter if she's with that Prince William or not. I'd have Ainsley [Harriott]; you know, that Ready Steady Cook geezer. I'd teach him a little lesson. And I'd have Roxy and Tanya from EastEnders. That's a nice mix. Wiley's new single Can You Hear Me (Ayayaya) feat Skepta, JME and Ms D is out on 28 Oct"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
