The association says almost 25 per cent of potential customers turn up without it, and the numbers are increasing. If you don't bring it, the rental company has to call the DVLA, and may pass the cost of this on to the hirer, and the company may refuse to rent the vehicle. The BVRLA also warns that drivers who take a rented vehicle to mainland Europe must carry a Vehicle On Hire Certificate (VE103) in the car with them at all times, or risk having it impounded. The association says there have been many cases recently of drivers carrying alternative letters of authority that are not accepted by local police.
