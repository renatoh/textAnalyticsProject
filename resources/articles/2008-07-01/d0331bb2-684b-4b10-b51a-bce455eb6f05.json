Recorded in great part in Sweden with Bjorn Yttling (Peter, Bjorn and John of 'Young Folks' fame), Beautiful Future is barely recognisable as a Scream album at first. It sounds clean, taut, bright. It thrums with the marimbas Abba once used. Wedding bells tinkle on the chirpy title track. The single, 'The Glory of Love', is actually about the glory of love. 'Uptown' slinks along nocturnally enough, but it presents a no-mess, late-night landscape where colours don't bleed, much less veins. Can ears do a double-take? For more than 20 years, Primal Scream have been in thrall to the grubbiest music in rock's degenerate canon. They have appropriated the Rolling Stones, the MC5 (with whom they recently shared a stage at Meltdown), rave culture and brassy soul music - anything louche, addled, attitudinous and beaded with sweat. Their career as hard-partying magpies has been uneven, peaking twice with the post-rave masterpiece Screamadelica in 1991, and again nearly a decade later with XTRMNTR. The Scream's last effort, Riot City Blues, took these retro stylings to the point of pastiche. Suddenly, filth has turned to sparkle. It is as though Channel 4's Aggie &amp; Kim have been let loose in Bobby Gillespie's ear canals, dredging out four decades of residue with borax. Only on the fifth track do the Scream revert to type, on the splendidly ridiculous 'Suicide Bomb', a Jesus &amp; Mary Chain song in all but name. (Gillespie was once their drummer.) After Riot City Blues, Primal Scream could not have carried on mincing up the same rock leftovers again. But they make a thoroughly bogus pop band. Not even Gillespie's apocalyptic lyrics can compensate for the aural whitewash being applied to the Scream's shebeen. What's worse, they don't make an entirely plausible Primal Scream here either. 'Beautiful Summer' mobilises an organ, but never quite takes leave of its senses. 'Necro Hex Blues' promises voodoo, but the threat proves empty. Only a cover of Fleetwood Mac's 'Over &amp; Over', a duet with the sainted Linda Thompson (ex of Richard, mother of Teddy), really takes Primal Scream anywhere new worth visiting. Here's hoping they lose the shades and manage to stumble home for album number 10."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
