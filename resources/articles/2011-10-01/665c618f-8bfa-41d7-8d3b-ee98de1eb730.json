David Cameron and Chris Huhne will outline the measures after summoning Britain's six biggest suppliers to a special energy summit in London. In a joint article previewing the summit, the energy secretary and the prime minister express their joint determination to see a fall in prices. \"Energy bills have increased by more than \u00a3100 for most people since this summer. These price rises couldn't come at a worse time for consumers, who are already feeling the pinch from rising petrol prices and the cost of the weekly shop,\" Cameron and Huhne write in moneysavingexpert.com. \"Today we are bringing together the industry, consumer groups and Ofgem for an energy summit that will focus on getting people the help they need to reduce their bills in time for this winter. \"Our intention is for today's summit to be the start of a much more active engagement with consumers, with us all working harder and faster to deliver an energy market that is trusted, simple and transparent. \"A market that puts the consumer first and gets these energy bills down as much as possible.\" Huhne will chair the summit, which is to be opened by the prime minister, and will highlight two ways in which consumers can reduce their energy bills: \u2022 The government will write to thousands of consumers who are entitled to free home insulation. This can cut bills by \u00a3100 a year. \u2022 Switching to direct debit payments can save \u00a3100 a year. Huhne has been critical of consumers who fail to shop around for the best energy prices in the same way that they do for, say, a toaster. But in an interview with the Sunday Times, he placed the burden on energy companies. \"We know what's wrong with the energy market and we are addressing it,\" he said. \"There have been clear examples of malpractice, and Ofgem has found that people don't switch even though it could provide them with big savings.\" The energy secretary is resisting any pressure from within the coalition to slow down the move towards renewable energy sources. George Osborne announced at the Conservative party conference this month that Britain would cut its carbon emissions \"no slower but also no faster\" than the rest of the EU. Huhne will point out that a small proportion of the \u00a3300 increase in energy bills over the last year \u2013 just \u00a320 \u2013 has been caused by Britain's renewable obligations. The bulk of the increase has been caused by the dramatic rise in gas prices, a classic fossil fuel. Caroline Flint, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, said: \"The government's warm words won't heat homes during a bitter winter. \"They're unable to take on vested interests, they won't tackle the spiralling prices imposed by the energy giants, they won't investigate the mis-selling of energy and they won't help the pensioners whose winter fuel payments have been cut. \"Unless the out-of-touch government gets to grips with the real issues at the energy summit, their only promise is a cold, costly winter for all.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
