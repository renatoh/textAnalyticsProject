Weatherill consulted Mencap and discovered that 3% of people with a learning disability live as a couple, compared with 70% of the general adult population. He decided to write a play about someone who is neurodiverse and someone who is neurotypical falling in love. Jellyfish was the result. First seen at London\u2019s Bush theatre last year, it is now about to open at the National Theatre. The play is set in Skegness and depicts the relationship between Kelly and Neil. They make each other laugh, they both love chips and they have strong views about The Avengers. She has Down\u2019s syndrome and he doesn\u2019t, not that this bothers either of them. Kelly\u2019s mum, who raised her daughter alone, feels differently. She wants to protect her daughter and worries Neil might be exploiting her. At an early reading of the play, Weatherill met the actor Sarah Gordy, whose screen credits include the BBC\u2019s Strike, Upstairs Downstairs (she played Lady Pamela Holland) and Call the Midwife; she has also performed at Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange and the New Vic, Newcastle-under-Lyme. Gordy and Weatherill became close and their friendship informed the character of Kelly. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot from you,\u201d Weatherill says to her when the three of us meet. He looks at her and grins. \u201cYou tell me to pull my socks up.\u201d \u201cI love how Ben\u2019s brain works,\u201d says Gordy, \u201cand I love being Kelly. She\u2019s strong, witty and funny.\u201d Gordy wanted to act from a young age and used to perform with her sister to entertain the family. \u201cI love to have characters in my head. When I don\u2019t, I feel empty,\u201d she says. She loves Shakespeare. As You Like It is a particular favourite \u2013 she thinks she\u2019d make a good Phoebe. Both Weatherill and Gordy acknowledge that Jellyfish is a \u201ctricky, knotty\u201d play. It offers no easy answers. \u201cIt might make people uncomfortable,\u201d he says. The play doesn\u2019t shy away from the questions of consent, power and agency at its core, questions about who gets to make the decisions about Kelly\u2019s romantic life. The play also does not skirt the issue of sex. Kelly and Neil are very obviously attracted to each other. This was essential to Weatherill \u201cbecause disabled people aren\u2019t often seen as sexually attractive or sexy\u201d. Kelly\u2019s mum, played by Penny Layden, struggles to see Kelly as a woman with sexual agency; the need to protect her is too ingrained. Gordy makes it clear that Kelly\u2019s sexuality is an integral part of her character. The play lets her character flirt, kiss and be kissed, and she\u2019s enjoyed the opportunity to perform this. From early on Weatherill was adamant that he wanted a scene in which two characters with learning disabilities are on stage together talking about something other than their disabilities. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what they would say, but that was important.\u201d To this end he created the character of Dominic, played by the actor and comedian Nicky Priest, who is initially set up on a blind date with Kelly but goes on to become her friend. As someone who has Asperger syndrome and is familiar with the stereotypes surrounding the condition, Priest found playing the character rewarding and hopes to contribute to changing those perceptions through his portrayal. Gordy is excited about the prospect of playing the National Theatre. \u201cIt\u2019s like a dream come true,\u201d she says. It won\u2019t be the first play there in which a character with learning difficulties features prominently \u2013 this was also true of 2013\u2019s Up Down Boy \u2013 but it\u2019s not a long list. \u201cThere should be more people with Down\u2019s syndrome on screen and everywhere in the industry,\u201d says Gordy. Priest also believes that if a play features neurodiverse characters, every effort should be made to cast neurodiverse performers, as not only will it provide more opportunities for them but \u201cthe portrayal of those neurodiverse characters will be as authentic and accurate as possible. It\u2019s not rocket science.\u201d Weatherill says that when he started sending his play out, one theatre wondered if it wouldn\u2019t be easier if an actor without a learning difficulty played the lead. This was only five years ago, but the conversation around disability and representation has moved on since then. You wonder if that question would be asked now. Ultimately, says Gordy, it\u2019s not really a play about Down\u2019s syndrome. It\u2019s one woman\u2019s story, agrees Weatherill. It\u2019s not intended to represent a community. Recently he was in discussion with some \u201ctelly people\u201d and he floated an idea featuring Gordy to which they responded: \u201cWe\u2019ve already got one Sarah Gordy project.\u201d \u201cNo one says that about Sheridan Smith,\u201d he says. \u201cJust because you\u2019ve done something once doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s finished. We\u2019re not done.\u201d \u2022 Jellyfish is at the National Theatre, London, 5-16 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
