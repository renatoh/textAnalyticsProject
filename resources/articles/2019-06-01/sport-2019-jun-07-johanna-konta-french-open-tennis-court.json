Rafael Nadal\u2019s match against Roger Federer started two hours later on Court Philippe Chatrier, the traditional home of the women\u2019s semi-finals, followed there by the second men\u2019s semi between Novak Djokovic and Dominic Thiem. Instead of having their big day on Chatrier, the British No 1 and her opponent, Marketa Vondrousova, were moved to Court Simonne Mathieu, where the Czech teenager won 7-5, 7-6 (2), while Ashleigh Barty\u2019s match against Amanda Inisimova took place on Court Suzanne Lenglen. The Australian won 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-3. Konta described the tournament\u2019s newest and prettiest workplace, nestled into the garden next door, as \u201ca beautiful court, no doubt about it\u201d. But she agreed it was not a good look. \u201cThe way it looks probably speaks for itself.\u201d Did it feel like a semi-final, playing in a half-empty stadium? \u201cIn terms of the surrounding and the occasion, probably not. In terms of the match itself, probably, yeah.\u201d Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, Andy Murray\u2019s one-time coach, described it as \u201ca disgrace\u201d. She said on social media, \u201cEveryone agrees that the match of the day is Federer/Nadal. But what kind of message do we send when taking the decision to put the women\u2019s semis at 11am on the second and third courts of the tournament? Not even one of them on centre court.\u201d Did Konta agree? \u201cI know you guys want headlines on this and you want me to say something really juicy. But, more than anything, what is tiring and what is really unfortunate is that athletes, female athletes, have to justify their scheduling or their involvement in an event, or their salary or their opportunities. To give time to that is even more of a sad situation than what we found ourselves in today in terms of the scheduling. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sit here and justify where I\u2019m scheduled. That\u2019s not my job. My job is to come here and entertain people, and I feel I did that. And I feel I gave people who bought tickets every opportunity to enjoy their French Open experience. \u201cIf the organisers do not feel that is something that can be promoted and celebrated, then I think it\u2019s the organisers you need to have a conversation with, not me, because I did my job and I did my job well.\u201d Federer, who lost in straight sets to Nadal, agreed with the objections to the rescheduling. \u201cI understand. You make it all the way to the semis and you get put on the third-biggest court at 11am. It\u2019s a tough one. When I saw the schedule, I was a bit surprised.\u201d Ever the diplomat, he said the change might not have been necessary if they had played more matches earlier in the week \u2013 or had a roof on one of the courts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
