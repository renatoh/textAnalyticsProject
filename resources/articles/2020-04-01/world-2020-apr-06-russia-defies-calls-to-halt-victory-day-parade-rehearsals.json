The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is supposed to host France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and other world leaders at a military parade to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war. The event is a significant historical landmark for Russia and a coveted photo opportunity to claim Putin\u2019s re-emergence from political isolation in the west. But with 12 million Muscovites confined to their apartments and a global pandemic ushering in a period of self-isolation, preparations for the parade have raised concerns in Russia. A leaked video has shown up to 15,000 soldiers lined up on a parade grounds outside Moscow, where Russia\u2019s defence ministry has confirmed that it is holding rehearsals for the event, most recently on 1 April. \u201cHow many people are there, 15,000? Fuck, and they\u2019ve said no more than 50 are supposed to gather in one place. Not one fucking mask,\u201d said one voice on the video, which was shot anonymously. Refurbished T-34 tanks have also been filmed performing parade manoeuvres at the grounds in Alabino, where authorities say they have built a to-scale model of Red Square. Russia\u2019s general prosecutor has censured a news website for writing that the parade may be cancelled in one Russian region due to the coronavirus, sayingits article violated regulations on fake news. \u201cMay 9th is a sacred date for millions upon millions in Russia and CIS countries,\u201d a foreign ministry account wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe Victory Day parade is scheduled (sanitary measures taken) and will march on Red Square.\u201d The opposition leader Alexei Navalny blasted what he called the \u201cidiocy\u201d of the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, for going forward with the rehearsals, calling the crowds of soldiers a potential \u201cbreeding ground for the coronavirus\u201d. Russia\u2019s defence ministry has said that it is taking precautionary measures to ensure the soldiers\u2019 safety, including regular temperature checks. \u201cAll the members of the rehearsals are burning with desire to participate in this historic event and are training their hearts out,\u201d said Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the ministry. The virus has wreaked havoc on an important political season in Russia. Putin has already delayed a symbolic public vote on constitutional amendments that would allow him to run for another two terms as president, potentially ruling until 2036. A major business forum in St Petersburg scheduled for June has also been cancelled. Victory Day is the most important public event remaining in Russia\u2019s calendar. Western leaders have snubbed the parade since 2014, following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Moscow\u2019s alleged meddling in the US presidential elections and the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 have made relations even chillier. Still, the Kremlin has sought to leverage the memory of the second world war to bring foreign leaders back to Moscow. Macron, who has been keen to rebuild relations with Putin, had agreed to attend the parade, as had the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and the US national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien. But with more than 7,500 deaths due to coronavirus in France, it appears less likely now that Macron will attend, and Japanese media have also reported that Abe does not plan to go. The Kremlin has said that it understands if foreign guests choose not to attend and has said it is considering \u201ca wide variety of options\u201d for what to do, but that so far it plans to go forward with the parade. The Russian business newspaper RBC has said the Kremlin is quietly considering either holding the parade without spectators or postponing the event until August. This 9 May marks the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, elevated under Putin to the country\u2019s most important holiday. Russia holds a military parade on Red Square with with soldiers, tanks and intercontinental ballistic missiles and sees hundreds of thousands march with pictures of their relatives in a new tradition called the Immortal Regiment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
