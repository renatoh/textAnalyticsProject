Why on earth did the chancellor include supermarkets, whose stores remain open and popular, in his business rates holiday? There was no need to do so. The result is a fine mess that the Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, made worse with a disingenuous defence of his chain\u2019s \u00a3585m slice of the business rates freebie. To be scrupulously fair, one should first mention the solid element in Lewis\u2019s stance on dividends. Tesco\u2019s \u00a3635m final payment, the second part of an overall \u00a3900m distribution, relates to a 12-month period that ended in February. Since Tesco enjoyed a good run with operating profits improving 13.5% to \u00a32.9bn, investors are entitled to a decent reward. Tesco can afford it. But Lewis showed himself to be out of touch with the times when he suggested that the business rates holiday, as it applies to Tesco, is somehow a form of compensation for extra costs involved in hiring new staff, and so on, in recent weeks. \u201cOur [additional] costs far exceed the \u00a3585m of business relief we\u2019ve been given by the government,\u201d he said. His arithmetic will be correct, but, come on, Tesco ought to count its blessings. Unlike non-food retailers, its sales are booming. Yes, extra demand means extra overheads but in a pandemic it\u2019s reasonable to expect a strong national retailer to take them on the chin. Business rates are a property-based tax. If your properties are open and trading well, why would relief be justified? The Treasury may have been in too much of a hurry to think through the detail of its catch-all policy on rates for the retail sector, but Tesco\u2019s board (and those of its peers) should know better. The right response would be to thank the chancellor for his generosity but say supermarkets don\u2019t need relief on rates given the pressure on the public purse. Such an approach might imply a lower dividend in a year\u2019s time, but that\u2019s life. Tesco and its main rivals should rethink. Their companies \u2013 or, rather, their staff \u2013 have rightly been applauded for calmly managing the panic-buying nonsense and keeping shelves well stocked. Don\u2019t burn the goodwill. Watchdog needs to say it straight Over in the insurance sector, is Legal &amp; General on the regulatory naughty step for its go-it-alone decision to pay a dividend for 2019? Probably not, but it\u2019s hard to say definitively. The Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority is communicating in public via nods and suggestions, which is an odd way to behave. The PRA definitely likes those insurers \u2013 Aviva, RSA, Hiscox and Direct Line \u2013 that cancelled their divis on Wednesday. It welcomed \u201cthe prudent decision from some companies today to pause dividends given the uncertainties associated with Covid-19\u201d. But what does that imply about L&amp;G? Does the regulator think its board was imprudent? One assumes not, because L&amp;G\u2019s chairman is Sir John Kingman, a former Treasury bigwig who knows better than to quarrel with a regulator. He will surely have double-checked that L&amp;G was OK to pay its dividend. And perhaps L&amp;G, as more of a life insurer and asset manager, is different: it doesn\u2019t write commercial insurance lines, which is arguably the hottest area for Covid-related claims. Yet Sam Woods, the head of the PRA, could do everybody a favour by being clearer. With the banks, he wrote his extraordinary \u201cstop paying dividends or else\u201d letters to boards, which was unpopular with most recipients but was impossible to misunderstand. The tone with insurers, on the other hand, was more \u201cthink carefully\u201d. Some took that to mean \u201cfall into line without a fuss\u201d; others clearly thought they still had freedom to choose. A crisis is no time for semantic debate. The PRA should say what it means clearly. Heathrow pay threat There are many ways to invite workers to take a pay cut and here\u2019s a bad one: accept a 15% reduction or \u201cdismissal and reinstatement might be the final step\u201d. That\u2019s from Heathrow\u2019s chief people officer to non-union members. For good measure, Paula Stannett added: \u201cThere will be consequences if colleagues do not accept the revised terms as it will mean that we have to make further job cuts.\u201d This message, or threat, would have been improved if it had spelled out what \u201cconsequences\u201d will apply to Heathrow\u2019s owner, a consortium led by the Spanish group Ferrovial and the Qatar Investment Authority. They have financed the airport with maximum levels of debt for years, leaving little room for financial manoeuvre in a crisis. One assumes they\u2019ll also take a hit, but, when asking low-paid staff to volunteer for lower wages, spell out what it is."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
