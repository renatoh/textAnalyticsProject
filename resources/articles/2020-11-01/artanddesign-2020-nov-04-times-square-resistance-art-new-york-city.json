More recently, though, it has become a site of artistic expression, taken over by a free fall of protest art, colorful parades and performances. \u201cIt lacks the same history of worker organization spaces like Union Square, but with the spread of digital graphics and art during the Covid-19 pandemic and black-led uprisings, Times Square has made itself a unique site for protest in a city with more empty space, and an ongoing stream of creative mobilizations,\u201d said Sarah J Seidman, a curator at the Museum of the City of New York. Just last month, the Brooklyn artist Don Perlis created a painting of George Floyd with the police officer kneeling on his neck, which has been blown up into a giant billboard with a quote from the Dalai Lama, which reads: \u201cBe kind whenever possible, it is always possible.\u201d It\u2019s part of a series spearheaded by the George Floyd Justice Billboard Committee (the chairwoman is Corinne Innis, daughter of civil rights leader Roy Innis). \u201cPicasso said: \u2018Art is a weapon,\u2019 and the painting of George Floyd is a plea for justice and kindness,\u201d said Perlis. \u201cWe hope this can help to bring people together and help bring about profound change so this kind of thing will never happen again.\u201d Times Square could be the perfect place to shed light on such a pressing issue. \u201cWe hoped putting the billboard in the so-called \u2018Crossroad of the World\u2019 would remind people of our common humanity and of the need for change,\u201d adds the artist. The district saw many colorful protests this summer. Ebony Brown, a founding member and participant in the Wide Awakes, a group spearheaded by the For Freedoms co-founder Hank Willis Thomas, worked to commemorate the 160th anniversary of the namesake, Lincoln-era abolitionist group for a \u2018Juneteenth Jubilee\u2019, which lasted all summer. The group also put on a Vote Feminist Art Parade last month which took over the area with vibrancy and urgency. \u201cPeople needed to laugh, dance and sing, even if they were masked and socially distancing,\u201d said Brown. While New Yorkers typically avoid Times Square for its crowds and general garishness, it still brought the political performance artists. \u201cUltimately, what we created was performance art, it just happened to be an act of multicultural, civic engagement,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shut down Broadway on a Saturday night, reclaiming the streets in the name of all the lives stolen by racial violence and police brutality.\u201d Another group that rallied for art workers came out for Be An Arts Hero, a national \u2018day of action\u2019 on Labor Day for creative workers affected by the pandemic \u2013 especially the Broadway staff. Over a hundred people gathered in Times Square, from choreographers to costume designers, to sing Will I? from the musical Rent (the lyrics go: \u201cWill I lose my dignity? Will someone care?\u201d). \u201cIt was an opportunity to start to change the conversation around arts work,\u201d Jenny Grace Makholm, an organizer with the group. \u201cTimes Square is the heartbeat of the Broadway community, the soul of New York\u2019s theater district, and just as the arts has been devastated by this crisis, so has Times Square.\u201d New York artist Andy Golub recently held his seventh annual Bodypainting Day in Times Square, which was significantly different from its past tradition of parading stripped-down performers, which got the artist arrested in 2011 (\u201cbut things have been settled since then,\u201d says the artist). \u201cMany people think that performance art, like bodypainting, is all about getting attention, but it\u2019s really about bringing people together,\u201d he said. Granted, there has always been art in Times Square, from Spencer Tunick\u2019s group shots of nudes, to Public Art Fund projects and the ongoing series with Times Square Arts but of late, it\u2019s multiplied, with more advertising space, recently taken over by the digital billboard campaign to honor and thank essential workers called Messages for the City. This summer also saw the French street artist Mr Brainwash (the moniker for Thierry Guetta), host a series of banners and murals on the side of a building, with phrases like: \u201cWe are all in this together\u201d and \u201cLove is the answer\u201d. There\u2019s a rotating cast of video art, too, on the screens as part of the Midnight Moment series \u2013 a lovely break from the onslaught of ads \u2013 from watching people sleeping, eating or dancing. It also is a place to scream one\u2019s own opinion, like when the Lincoln Project recently mounted digital billboards featuring Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. And individual creators, like the costume designer Claire Zhang, who recently wore her Marie Antoinette-esque gown to Times Square, continue to challenge conventions. \u201cThe importance of using Times Square as a site for protest and pandemic art is to raise people\u2019s awareness of the diversity of this city, and to make them feel more connected to the world,\u201d said Zhang. Despite all its pitfalls, it\u2019s still a place where artists go to be heard. \u201cWith tourism having virtually disappeared from the city, it was an opportunity to send the message that New York City is resilient and that our creative spirit can\u2019t be broken,\u201d adds Golub. Indeed, the spirit of the city could be captured in this chaotic flickering part of midtown. \u201cI think, in many ways, Times Square represents America,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be pretty extreme at times, whether it\u2019s increasing crime or excessive commercialism, but it\u2019s also a place where freedom of expression thrives.\u201d While it\u2019s clear that Times Square will always remain problematic to locals (like Lebowitz, for example), it will always be a hub for something. \u201cIt may not be the heart of New York, but it\u2019s the face,\u201d said Golub. \u201cRight now, things are a little tough, but we are resilient. It\u2019s the role of the artists to keep following their vision and celebrate life, especially when things are challenging.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
