This time he kept his shirt on - there was no Zinedine Zidane in the Tottenham side with whom to exchange souvenirs - but his body language appeared to convey the same message. Maybe, just maybe, he is on his farewell tour. His performance in yesterday's 2-0 victory was very different, however, from the frenetic half-hour cameo he delivered last Wednesday at Old Trafford against Real Madrid. This was a display devoid of anger, even of ego. It was a blue-collar performance, the work of a devoted team man, devoid of tricks or trappings, and it had its reward. On balance, Manchester United should have gone in at half-time leading by four or five goals. That they had failed to score was due to a combination of Ruud Van Nistelrooy's profligacy and Kasey Keller's brave goalkeeping. The opening 20 minutes of the second period were quieter, the home defence generally succeeding in keeping United's forwards out of the penalty area. But with 68 minutes on the clock Beckham got hold of the ball on the right-hand touchline, near the halfway line. Looking up, he clipped a diagonal ball into the central area, aiming for Paul Scholes. With marvellous judgment, Scholes adjusted to the low trajectory and let the ball glance off the top of his head to Ryan Giggs, lurking wide on the left. Giggs brought it under control with a single touch, waited for a second, and then lifted it in a perfect arc for Scholes to run on and glance an angled header past Keller. Beckham, Giggs and Scholes have been friends and team-mates for a decade and, if they are finally to be separated, by Ferguson's desire to rebuild or by Beckham's desire to graze in fresh pastures, then few could begrudge them the shared celebration of an eighth league championship as the last token of an extraordinary era. The goal that dealt a double blow to north London yesterday certainly carried the authentic hallmark of speed, skill and understanding as it brought the title into view. By then they were playing in the familiar 4-4-2 formation, with Beckham and Giggs wide on the wings and Van Nistelrooy and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer up front. But Ferguson had chosen to open the match with the 4-3-3 which had brought them victory on the night, although not in the tie, against Real, with Giggs completing the forward trio. The dropping of Juan Sebastian Veron and Nicky Butt yesterday allowed Beckham and Scholes to join Roy Keane in the three-man midfield, with Beckham playing in a narrower position on the right, generally holding station 15 yards in from the touchline. He adapted to the modified role without apparent discomfort, chasing and harrying when necessary and playing a full part in the careful moves with which United probed the Spurs defence. After half an hour he chipped a lovely ball on to Van Nistelrooy's forehead, the powerful header drawing a fine save from Keller. Ferguson reacted to the lack of goals by switching the formation at the interval, in search for greater width and perhaps more directness than finesse. Now Beckham started to run at Mauricio Taricco, with the expected result as the Argentinian full-back tried to deny him. Beckham was rubbing his bruised shin as he watched Giggs drive a cross-shot past the far post. Two minutes later the pain had ebbed sufficiently for him to curl in a 25-yard free-kick which Keller tipped around a post. Any suspicion that Beckham and Ferguson are no longer on speaking terms was dispelled a quarter of an hour from the end, when the manager, with a solicitous air, instructed him to take a drink during a pause while a Spurs player received treatment. And when Gary Neville replaced Wes Brown at right-back, that side of United's team resumed its well-grooved routine. Beckham played no part in the second goal, but he was there to jump on the back of Quinton Fortune, whose run and pass in injury-time made the chance that Van Nistelrooy finally put away. This was the goal that made sure United would profit from Arsenal's stumble, and the joy bubbled over. But only moments later, that final salute certainly resembled a lap of honour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
