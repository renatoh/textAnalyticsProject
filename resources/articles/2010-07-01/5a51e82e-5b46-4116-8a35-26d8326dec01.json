White to play and win. RB Is there anything more headache-inducing than an endgame study? And the simpler the position, the more intense the pain. I think, after almost an hour, that I've found the first three moves of the winning sequence, but I can't seem to find the knockout blow. 1 Kf6 seems obvious and good \u2013 go for the diagonal opposition! Since 1...g5 loses immediately to 2 Kg6, Black's only move is 1...Kh7. Now 2 g4 is equally obvious (after 2 h4 h5 White can make no further progress). Black has only two options, and since 2...h5 allows 3 g5, when the black king will be forced to retreat to the back rank and White will gobble up the pawns, 2...g5 is the sensible continuation. Now, I thought, I have him: 3 Kf7, gaining the opposition and forcing the king away from the defence of the pawns. Except there's a flaw in the plan: Black doesn't have to retreat but can play 3...h5 when White has nothing more than a draw after 4 gxh5 Kh6. DK I don't share Ronan's feelings about so-called \"simple positions\". With so few pieces on the board I always feel I have a chance to find the truth in the position, just by the mechanical process of elimination. Actually Ronan has almost cracked it. His logic is impeccable and has brought him to 1 Kf6 Kh7 2 g4 g5 3 Kf7 h5 \u2013 but this is no draw. White wins using a similar breakthrough to Magnus Carlsen's in last week's game. It's extremely rare that two chess games are identical, but patterns do recur. 4 h4! is the very visual winning move. The main variation runs 4...gxh4 5 g5 h3 6 g6+ Kh6 7 g7 h2 8 g8(Q) h1(Q) 9 Qg6 checkmate. After 4 h4 Black could try 4...Kh6 but White wins with 5 Kf6 gxh4 6 g5+ Kh7 7 Kf7 transposing to the line above. Incidentally, in the starting position 1 Kf7 would only draw: 1...Kh7 2 g4 g5 3 Kf6 h5! 4 Kxg5 (in this case 4 h4 gxh4 5 g5+ Kg8 even wins for Black) 4...hxg4 5 hxg4 Kg7 gaining the opposition with a standard drawing position. chess@guardian.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
