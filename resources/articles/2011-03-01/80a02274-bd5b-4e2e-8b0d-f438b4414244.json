The development comes as it was reported that the child, aged five or six and referred to by police as \"Adam\" in the absence of a real name, may have been identified. A Nigerian woman who cared for the boy while living in Germany a decade ago said that his real name was Ikpomwosa, according to a report on ITV London Tonight. Joyce Osiagede, who was shown a photograph of the boy earlier this month in Nigeria, was reported have been questioned by police in Glasgow in 2002 before she was deported, after they connected her to the case. Osiagede, who said she was willing to talk to police if they went to see her, said she had looked after Adam in 2001 as a favour to a friend but then gave him to a man she calls Bawa. \"I travelled with my two children to Britain to seek refuge ... I phoned Bawa and said: 'Where is Ikpomwosa? He said: 'He's dead'.\" She was asked: \"You say you didn't have anything to do with the killing?\" She replied: \"No. I'm a mother, I have children. I can't kill somebody's child.\" Asked if she knew who killed Adam, she said: \"Yes ... No. I don't know the group of people. They used him for a ritual in the water. I gave Ikpomwosa to Bawa. Listen carefully please. I gave Ikpomwosa to Bawa and when I go to Scotland, Britain, he said Ikpomwosa is dead.\" Will O'Reilly, a former detective inspector who led the original Scotland Yard investigation, told the programme that police had searched Osiagede's flat in Scotland and found clothing from the same company and the same size as worn by the boy. The boy's headless, limbless body was found in the river near Tower Bridge on 21 September, 2001. Investigators initially had little to go on but forensic work based on samples taken from his bones linked him first to West Africa and then to Nigeria. Other tests revealed the child had been poisoned 48 hours before his death with an extract from the carabar bean. This would have left him paralysed but conscious when his throat was cut in what is believed to have been a ritualistic killing. A Metropolitan police spokesman said: \"We can confirm that the investigation team have been preparing to visit Lagos, Nigeria, in connection with the Adam inquiry. They will be travelling in the near future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
