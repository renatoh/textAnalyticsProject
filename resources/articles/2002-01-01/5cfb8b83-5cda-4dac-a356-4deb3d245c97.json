Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, said Lufthansa was attempting not only to block ads publicising its low fares, but also had \"sought to prevent Ryanair issuing press releases or making statements in the German market\". Ryanair said it had lodged a second complaint with EU competition commissioner Mario Monti after filing an initial complaint last year against the German carrier. An aggressive advertiser, Ryanair won a high court battle last December, when a judge said the Irish carrier had fairly called British Airways \"expensive bastards\". But the budget airline won vindication for its advertising campaign that claimed BA, which describes itself as the world's favourite airline, charged five times as much as the low cost Irish firm on some fares. BA had objected to the Ryanair ads that appear under the headings \"Expensive BA\" and \"Expensive Ba----ds\" as unfair. Ryanair's legal and marketing battle with Lufthansa comes as it seeks to expand in continental Europe. The Dublin-based carrier announced late last year it was expanding its operations to include a new continental Europe hub at Frankfurt-Hahn airport. But Ryanair has got into trouble by overstepping the mark in some of its advertising. The carrier was today reprimanded for a misleading advertisement about cheap flights. A recent newspaper advertisement by Ryanair featured a one-way flight from Dublin to London Stansted for \u00a319.99, and another to Paris for \u00a329.99. It then stated the offer was \"every seat on every flight\", before adding in small print at the bottom that tickets were subject to conditions and a weekend supplement. A member of the public who tried to book a ticket found the offer applied only to midweek flights. The person complained to the Advertising Standards Authority, which upheld the complaint, saying the advertisement did not make it clear the supplement applied to flights from Thursday to Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
