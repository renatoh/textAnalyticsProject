And Totenham's amazing comeback at Charlton on Wednesday might be the biggest result George Graham has achieved in his time at White Hart Lane, bigger even than winning the Worthington Cup. With Stockport at home in the fifth round, Spurs fans will start to sniff a passage to the final. And if George does go on to win the Cup this season half the knockers might even start putting him up with Bill Nicholson, particularly if Arsenal come away with nothing. Results such as the one Spurs got at the Valley bring a surge of confidence and keep seasons alive. In George's case there has been talk of it saving his job, although in a funny way it increases the pressure because if Stockport beat them the antagonism would multiply and it might be hard for him to ride that out. I know from personal experience at Aston Villa how much one late comeback can shape a season. As Easter weekend arrived in 1992-93 we were top of the Premiership, just ahead of Manchester United, and I really thought we were going to see it through. On the Saturday we were held to a goalless draw by Coventry, and although that was disappointing we knew United were being held at home by Sheffield Wednesday when the final whistle went at Villa Park. As were going off someone told me United had equalised and I said: \"By the time we get to the dressing room they'll have won it.\" Sure as anything, they did. It was the day Steve Bruce got two headers, Alex Ferguson's famous watch came to everyone's attention and he and Brian Kidd were racing on to the pitch at the end. When you have ever seen Fergie running and jumping on the pitch like he did that day? He was like a dervish and that showed how much it meant to them and the lift it gave the club. The referee had played six minutes over the time he said he was going to play, and that was the first time that season I thought \"They'll win it now\". We kept at it but that re ally was the turning point. They romped home to their first title since 1967, winning their last five matches. Whether Spurs' comeback will spark a long-term run of trophies remains to be seen, but cup wins have turned things for managers before, none more so than for Howard Kendall when he took Everton to Oxford in the League Cup in 1983-84. Everton were struggling in the league at that time and rumours abound that a defeat would have seen Howard dismissed. They were a goal down until a few minutes from time when a Kevin Brock backpass put in Adrian Heath for an equaliser. Everton went on to the final of that competition, and although they lost that one to Liverpool they beat Watford in the FA Cup final in the same season, and the following years were covered in the glory of a Cup Winners' Cup triumph and two league championships. Who knows what would have happened if they hadn't won that night and who knows what might have happened to Ferguson and the success he has had at Old Trafford if United hadn't won a third round FA Cup tie at Nottingham Forest in 1990? United had already gone out of the League Cup and were struggling in the league that season. Then Mark Robins got a little nipped-in header at the City Ground to win the tie 1-0, United went on to win the Cup after a replay with Crystal Palace and from that moment on the trophies started to flood in. Of course, there are key moments which have destroyed managers as well saved them. Alf Ramsey's whole England career, for example, turned on Norman Hunter's poor challenge against Poland. Norman was favourite to win the ball but he tried to nick it rather than put in one of his usual thunder tackles in, and Poland broke free and Jan Domarksi scored. Although Sniffer Clarke equalised from the penalty spot, we could not beat an inspired Jan Tomaszewski again and failed to qualify for 1974 World Cup. Ramsey was sacked not long after. With the players we had available we could have gone on and done very well in the finals in West Germany but there was no way back. The way Spurs fought back on Wednesday was an indication that they knew they were at the last chance saloon for this season, that it was do or die. It may well have been that if that had been a run of the mill league game they wouldn't have pulled it round. But players are desperate to be involved in big matches and get to cup finals. George Graham has to hope those four goals in 25 minutes are the start of great things to come. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
