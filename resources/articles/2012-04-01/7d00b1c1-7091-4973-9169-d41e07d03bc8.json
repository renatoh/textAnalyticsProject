The no-frills narrative flits around three vantage points: the lead terrorist, the government negotiator and the point man for the French elite counter-terrorism squad. Director Leclercq, who delivered promising low-budget sci-fi film Chrysalis, builds up the pressure leading to the inevitable storming, and it's hard not to get caught up. The characters are drawn with lean precision: there's no time for grandstanding speeches, and very little sentimentality. The kind of serious, adult action movie that the US and UK struggle to make."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
