He told the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, John Reid, that the police were close to breaking point because of loyalist and republican violence. He insisted that it was essential to retain the 2,000-strong full-time reserve force, which faces disbandment under current reforms of policing in Northern Ireland. \"If you want policing to collapse, disband them,\" he said at the federation's annual conference near Belfast, attended by Dr Reid. Rank and file delegates heard their chairman accuse the government of overestimating the level of peace. He called for a fundamental review of the early release of terrorists from prison and warned against plans to devolve policing powers to the Northern Ireland executive. Almost 800 officers have been injured in civil disorder over the past 12 months. About 900 policemen are currently on sick leave. Under these circumstances, and in the current security climate, Mr Montgomery argued that the full-time reserve, which is due to be scrapped under the Patten blueprint for reforming the Royal Ulster constabulary, is still essential. \"The government has simply not faced up to the growing danger to this community by its own failure to respond firmly to the overall security threat,\" he said. Northern Ireland's new chief constable, Hugh Orde, has also made clear that he thinks the full-time reserve is indispensable. Mr Montgomery said that many of those orchestrating the ongoing street violence had been freed under the Good Friday agreement. He recommended sending back to jail anyone against whom there is the slightest shred of evidence. \"Those who terrorise our communities, and also murdered and injured thousands, should not be rewarded with the opportunity to make an input into how the community is policed,\" he said in reference to plans to get Sinn Fein on to Northern Ireland's policing board. Elsewhere in Northern Ireland, a former republican hunger striker is expected to face renewed demands to name members of the IRA who were active in Londonderry at the time of Bloody Sunday. Lord Saville, who is heading the Bloody Sunday inquiry, told Raymond McCartney he may ordered to reveal identities. Mr McCartney, 47, a former IRA commanding officer in the Maze prison and convicted double murderer, has said that in \"no circumstances\" would he name anyone in the organisation. He joined the IRA within months of Bloody Sunday, which occurred on January 30 1972."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
