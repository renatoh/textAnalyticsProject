BSkyB has thrown down the gauntlet to the BBC to convince it that it deserves to pay less for its satellite carriage - as the BBC prepares to renegotiate its deal. Channel 4 is hitting back at the BBC's Great Britons extravaganza with an irreverent two-hour special on the 100 worst Britons. Superstars, the show that made a household name of judo master Brian Jacks and saw Kevin Keegan knocked off his bicycle, is returning to BBC1 for a full series. BBC3 controller Stuart Murphy has given the green light to the channel's first theme night, based around UFOs, as his channel posted promising ratings in its launch week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
