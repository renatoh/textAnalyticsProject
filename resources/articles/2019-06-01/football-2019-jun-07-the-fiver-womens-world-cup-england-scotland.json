An England team surfing into a World Cup on a wave of hype? Check. The same team being touted as genuine contenders by its many media cheerleaders? Check. An opening group game against dangerously underrated opponents to whom few give a snowball\u2019s chance in hell? Checkity, check check check. While there is no shortage of bores on social media disgraces who care so little about women\u2019s football they seem compelled to spend their every waking hour droning on about how inferior it is to the men\u2019s game, the parallels between England\u2019s Lionesses pitching up for the Women\u2019s World Cup and countless men\u2019s teams arriving at major competitions before them are striking \u2026 and rather ominous for those of a cynical bent. With tedious, pointless arguments about the perceived shortcomings of women\u2019s football put to bed, tucked in and read a story by John Stones, Ross Barkley, Harry Maguire and Kyle Walker, the time for pointless comparisons is now over. The Women\u2019s World Cup kicks off in Paris on Friday night, where an estimated 47,000 people are expected to convene for the tournament opener between hosts France and South Korea. The fact that there are other teams \u2013 23 of them, in fact \u2013 apart from England competing may come as a surprise to anyone who has been following the coverage of Phil Neville\u2019s side, who play their opening game against a comparatively unheralded and reclusive Scotland side in Nice on Sunday night. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked long and hard about it, we\u2019ve not been shy about our expectations,\u201d blurted Neville, following last weekend\u2019s chastening warm-up defeat against New Zealand. \u201cNow we need to deliver.\u201d While England are widely expected to see off a Scotland team they thrashed 6-0 at Euro 2017, the line-up they will face this time is a completely different proposition. With several part-timers among their ranks at the time, Scotland\u2019s players have since received government funding which enabled them to take six-month sabbaticals from their day jobs and focus solely on preparing for the World Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive difference now,\u201d bugled defender Nicola Docherty. \u201cWe had a lot of [knack] two years ago but we\u2019ve got a new coach [Shelley Kerr] now and a different style of play. We\u2019re also properly fit.\u201d Meanwhile in the England camp, Toni Duggan has called for \u201cequal criticism\u201d of the women\u2019s team, claiming the plaudits heaped upon them even when they play badly are rather patronising. \u201cIs it just because we\u2019re the women\u2019s team?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs it just because we\u2019re girls? If that was the men you wouldn\u2019t be saying that. I\u2019m not asking for journalists to criticise us all the time but it would be a sign of progress.\u201d While the pre-tournament hype has mirrored that loaded on to assorted England\u2019s men\u2019s teams down the years, it seems it will take an abject and unwanted group stage humiliation to measure just how much media perceptions of the Lionesses have really changed.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what this means to Kiyan\u2019s mum, to me, his brothers and sisters, his friends and people who have been supporting the work we have been doing. Kiyan would be blown away by what is going on\u201d \u2013 Mark Prince, whose son was stabbed to death outside his school aged 15 when he broke up a fight in 2006, thanks the QPR fans who have chosen to rename Loftus Road as The Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium for next season. FIVER LETTERS \u201cTo inject a note of seriousness in The Fiver, I\u2019m tired of hearing the FA apologise for England fans abroad. How about offering to pay for the clean-up and police time? All England tickets should be sold with a security deposit that\u2019s only returned if there\u2019s been no trouble, otherwise the money should all go to the host country in a gesture of goodwill. The FA talks too much and makes too little effort\u201d \u2013 John Daykin. \u201cSince my last letter (24 May) on the travails at my beloved, financially-knacked Bury FC, I can report that club legend Ryan Lowe, veteran of three separate spells at the club as a striker and the architect as manager of the most exciting \u2018brand of football\u2019 I\u2019ve witnessed in 20 years, and vice-captain \u2013 popular wing-back Nicky Adams, veteran of three separate spells at the club and king of the assist \u2013 have left the Shakers to take up work elsewhere. Things look increasingly bleak, and all the while our promotion-winning squad appear rich pickings for our more solvent rivals. The next court date is 19 June. In the meantime, if anyone wealthy and scrupulous would like to save the day, that would be great. Or at the very least, are there any potential noodle partners out there?\u201d \u2013 Darrien Bold [shout to the Plymouth fans doing their bit too \u2013 Fiver Ed]. \u201cRe: Fiver letters passim.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Gareth Southgate has been reflecting on England\u2019s capitulation and eventual extra-time exit from the Nations League against the Netherlands.\u201cI think fatigue has played a part, as well as a lack of match sharpness,\u201d he yawned. \u201cI can\u2019t overreact. This is incredibly painful for my players but we\u2019ll be stronger for our experiences.\u201d Harry Winks: England\u2019s midfield future? Meanwhile, England fans have criticised stadium authorities and Uefa for not doing enough to stop \u201cdangerous crushing\u201d after the electronic ticket system stopped working before Thursday\u2019s game. \u201cKids in tears, women fainting. No violence, just panic,\u201d said one, Tom Ambrose. \u201cWhen people asked for help, police raised batons and sparked further crushes.\u201d Coventry City will play their (18 miles from) home games at Birmingham City\u2019s St Andrew\u2019s next season after a groundshare was agreed. Everton\u2019s new No 2 is MTV Cribs\u2019s Luis Boa Morte. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to be joining a big club with so much history and tradition,\u201d he cheered. Wales manager Ryan Giggs reckons Manchester United-bound Daniel James just needs to be himself when he moves from Swansea. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest club in the world so my message to him is enjoy the challenge,\u201d he tooted. Chelsea have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport over their two-window transfer ban. And St\u00e9phanie Frappart has become the first woman to be named in Ligue 1\u2019s pool of referees. \u201cI am proud and honoured,\u201d she whistled. \u201cBeing the first woman to referee in Ligue 1 is a privilege, an honour and a responsibility.\u201d STILL WANT MORE?
