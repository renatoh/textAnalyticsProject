But the Department of Health confirmed that, in common with other citizens of EU member states, all Romanians and Bulgarians will have access to free NHS treatment while visiting Britain. Previously visitors from the two countries had needed a visa. A health department circular a fortnight ago stated that Romanians and Bulgarians were to get free health treatment in line with other EU member states and would need to show their passport to gain medical assistance. However, elective treatment and any treatment for pre-existing conditions that could be dealt with in their home state would be excluded. It is the first time that Britain has imposed labour market restrictions on citizens from an EU member state. It follows intense cabinet debate on the \"political dangers\" of allowing Romanians and Bulgarians to seek work. The two have a combined population of about 30 million. Only Ireland has so far followed suit with similar restrictions. The government underestimated the number of citizens it thought would come to Britain for work in the first wave of eastern European accession states in 2004, and how many would elect to work here for an extended time. It is still not sure what the longterm impact of the cheap labour might be on inflation and employment in the UK. Ministers are allowing up to 20,000 low-skilled Bulgarians and Romanians a right to six months' employment in agriculture - work previously undertaken largely by Ukrainians. Otherwise they will have to seek work permits for specific highly skilled jobs, or where there are specific jobs for which no UK applicants are available. A worry for the government is whether these rules will be widely breached. In Bucharest, on the eve of joining the EU, most people dismissed predictions of an exodus of young talent to Britain or other EU states, saying instead they wanted to make the best of EU membership at home. \"I want to stay here. If can't make it at home, I won't make it anywhere,\" said Razvan Popescu, a tourism student at the University of Bucharest. \"I would like to stay here and make a business with European Union funds. We are not expecting a miracle - people know the EU is not a land of dreams.\" Relief in Romania and Bulgaria at becoming the 26th and 27th members of the EU was palpable last night, as the countries' leaders celebrated joining the bloc before its door closed, at least temporarily. The Romanian prime minister, Calin Tariceanu, drank a toast at midnight with counterparts from several other European states and top EU officials. The Romanian president, Traian Basescu, marked the arrival of 2007 in Bucharest's University Square, which has been a traditional centre of the city's new year celebrations since the revolution of 1989 which toppled Nicolae Ceausescu. In Transylvania, the medieval city of Sibiu celebrated the start of its year as a European capital of culture. The average Bulgarian earns \u00a3130 a month. The populations of the two countries make up the poorest in the EU. Poles were fleeing up to 20% unemployment at home, but the economies of Romania and Bulgaria have been booming. Unemployment is low and labour shortages are leading firms to hire workers from China, Turkey, Ukraine and Moldova. \"Most people who wanted to leave have already gone,\" said Ionel Danca, chief editor of Romania's Eurolider political magazine. \"I don't think we will see a big change now - in fact, many people might see opportunities here and come home after spending years abroad.\" Mihail Arghiropol, who works for a Bucharest advertising firm, said that Romanians from poor, rural regions might head west, but he did not think there would be a brain drain. \"The biggest mistake now would be to leave,\" he said. \"The market is saturated abroad and lots of multinationals are coming here. For us, the future is Romania.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
