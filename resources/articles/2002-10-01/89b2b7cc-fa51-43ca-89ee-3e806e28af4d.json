Pratt, who scored one of Britain's two tries in the mauling by Australia in Sydney in July, confirmed yesterday that Powell had effectively shown him the door, even though he has another year remaining on his Headingley contract. He will not be the last with the scrum-half Ryan Sheridan, who like Pratt has retained his place in the national squad for this autumn's series against New Zealand, and the Australian stand-off Ben Walker expected to become two more high-profile victims. Gary Hetherington, the Leeds chief executive and football manager, refused to name the players who would be leaving, but confirmed that a major shake-up was underway with the Rhinos hoping to unveil a substantially reshaped 20-man senior squad on November 1. However the fact that Powell has clearly worked closely with Hetherington in deciding which players should go ends the uncertainty which has surrounded his future since Leeds's embarrassing play-off defeat at Wigan 10 days ago. Australia's coach Chris Anderson is still planning to be in charge for next autumn's Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, despite speculation that he will resign after this morning's one-off Test against New Zealand in Wellington. Steve Linnane, the Australian who was sacked by Halifax six weeks ago, is expected to be named as the new coach of Hull Kingston Rovers today. Linnane will succeed Gary Wilkinson, who was released after Rovers' exit from the Northern Ford Premiership play-offs last month. The play-offs reach their climax at Widnes tonight when Huddersfield play Leigh in the grand final, with promotion to the Super League at stake. For one set of players, and administrators, that will mean full-time employment for the next 12 months at least. The losers, however, will face an uncertain future, as both clubs have publicly questioned their own ability to sustain a promotion challenge for another year. Huddersfield would seem to have the most to lose. The Giants have established themselves beyond question as the best team in the competition by winning 26 and drawing the other of their 27 fixtures in the marathon NFP season which started last December, finishing a clear 10 points ahead of second-placed Leigh. So to miss out on promotion by losing a one-off game would be cruel indeed. Yet there would be as much smirking as sympathy if they do fall at the final hurdle. The Giants have still not been forgiven for the manner in which they stayed in the Super League from 1998-2001 despite finishing bottom four years running. Resentment has been fuelled by the parachute payment which the Giants received from the Super League when they were finally relegated this time last year which, together with Ken Davy's generous backing - he owns the DBS insurance group - has allowed them to remain largely full-time. Yet according to Steve McNamara, the former Hull, Bradford and Great Britain forward who has captained the Giants this season, \"People would be surprised if they knew exactly what full-time has meant. Yes, Ken Davy and the administrators deserve a lot of credit for what we've achieved this season. But I think the players do too for the sacrifices they have made to stay full-time.\" It is fair to speculate that the most highly-paid players in tonight's grand final will be Leigh's Bobbie Goulding and Vila Matautia, a pair of former Super League winners with St Helens who were brought in specifically for the play-offs. Leigh have fancied their chances of promotion in the last two years, only to be denied in the play-offs. They have therefore set out to time their run this year. That did not stop them being beaten at Huddersfield three weeks ago and they have suffered a further unwelcome distraction this week with the suspension of their Wales international Chris Morley who tested positive for ephedrine. But in a one-off match, with the stakes so high, anything could happen - especially with the unconventional Karl Kirkpatrick surprisingly appointed as referee."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
