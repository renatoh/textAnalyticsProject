Blame the French person.\u201d But it turned out he wasn\u2019t responsible for the noise. The couple finally met properly when Andy\u2019s then-boyfriend invited Yves round for a drink. \u201cThere was definitely some tension there,\u201d says Yves. \u201cYes,\u201d Andy agrees. \u201cMajor sexual tension!\u201d Before long, Yves went to Nottingham for work, while Andy stayed in Newcastle to continue her master\u2019s degree. By the time he returned after Christmas, Andy and her boyfriend had split up. \u201cHe was a lovely guy, but we didn\u2019t have anything in common.\u201d In a cunning plan to meet her French neighbour again, she dropped round to his flat to ask if he could change a lightbulb for her. Then she invited him to join her and a friend for dinner. \u201cMy poor friend went home early,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWe just gazed at each other all night.\u201d Yves adds that there was a lot of \u201cdrunken snogging\u201d. \u201cYes,\u201d says Andy. \u201cBut I sent you home afterwards.\u201d The couple spent the next two weeks together, before Yves announced that he was moving to Nottingham for work. They decided to keep their arrangement casual. \u201cYou told me it was fine to see other people,\u201d says Yves. \u201cYeah,\u201d Andy agrees. \u201cI didn\u2019t really mean it, though!\u201d One day, Andy went to meet Yves in Nottingham. \u201cI was nervous,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI\u2019m rubbish with faces and couldn\u2019t remember exactly what he looked like.\u201d She needn\u2019t have worried. \u201cWhen we met in town? Wow! That was the best kiss ever.\u201d Still, at this point, neither was looking for a serious relationship. \u201cHe was all heartbroken over another girl, saying: \u2018I\u2019ll never love again.\u2019\u201d But they continued to see each other after Yves moved to London a few months later. \u201cI used to drive from work late at night to come and see her,\u201d he remembers. \u201cOne time, I ended up sleeping in the car. I rang the doorbell at 2am, but she didn\u2019t wake up because she was drunk.\u201d Andy laughs. \u201cYeah, I probably was. I think it impressed me that you\u2019d slept in the car.\u201d By the end of 1997, they were officially a couple and Yves moved in with Andy. It is fair to say it didn\u2019t go smoothly at first. \u201cHe lost my cat. I told him not to leave the window open.\u201d Although she was \u201cfurious\u201d, she eventually forgave him. The pair decided to get married in 1999. \u201cHe\u2019s so handsome and such a charmer,\u201d Andy says. \u201cWe bicker, but it\u2019s from a place of humour and we have the same sensibilities at our core.\u201d Yves says their relationship has become stronger over time. \u201cAt the start, it was all drink, laughter and lust. I think we bid on laughter and took a chance.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think they bicker that much. \u201cWhat about the honeymoon fights?\u201d says Andy. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d Yves laughs, remembering one incident when they had been fighting in the car. \u201cI thought it would be funny to move the car while she was in the petrol station shop.\u201d Andy, who didn\u2019t realise, got in to someone else\u2019s car and started shouting at the man in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cThat poor Spanish bloke didn\u2019t know what hit him!\u201d In 2003, the couple moved to Portugal; they have since faced many difficult times together, including bereavement and Yves\u2019 battle with an aggressive cancer. He is better after treatment but it was a scary time. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone who saw us on that honeymoon would think we\u2019d still be together 20 years later,\u201d says Andy. \u201cHe makes me whole, though, as cliched as it sounds. He\u2019s funny, annoying \u2013\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not annoying,\u201d interrupts Yves. \u201cYou definitely are. But you make me a better person. I know I can be \u2013\u201d \u201cArsey? Short-tempered?\u201d They laugh again. \u201cAndy makes me a better person, too,\u201d says Yves. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be without her.\u201d Want to share your story?
