Or Carl is somehow going to live: meaning the show is basically meaningless. Weighing it up, you have to believe Carl\u2019s death is most likely. In which case, despite its frequent and baffling whirlwinds of nonsense, How It\u2019s Gotta Be did at least offer up something massive for us to chew on over the mid-season break. The show\u2019s breakneck pacing this season has proven both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, there have been no interminably, soul-meltingly boring episodes. Which has been very nice. On the other hand, time and events whizz by so fast they don\u2019t stick, small details like \u201cmaking sense\u201d tossed absently by the wayside. Case in point: The Saviors\u2019 escape from their besieged compound, and their seemingly instantaneous planning and execution of an intricate, multi-pronged retaliatory assault. At no point was it ever explained how this happened, besides \u201cEugene did it\u201d. We were just asked to accept The Saviors were back, undiminished, armed to the teeth with bullets they didn\u2019t have last week, and on the warpath. It was like someone had turned over two pages at once. Nevertheless, Negan grabbed his opportunity to shine with both hands, and the man does know how to make an entrance. His megaphoned whistle over Alexandria\u2019s fence came with a sense of foreboding he\u2019s struggled to muster in previous episodes, when he\u2019s clumsily oscillated between a desperate and damaged bully, and someone who loves talking about genitals and bottoms more than he loves anything else. If you can look past the mystery of how his Saviors reached Alexandria with all their organs still inside them, its destruction was fairly satisfying. And, you have to say, well-deserved. Carl stepped up the plate of de facto camp leader well, throwing Negan off the scent long enough to allow the convoy to break free, while secreting the most vulnerable inhabitants in some sewers, that apparently now exist. The number of second chances Negan is willing to offer those who cross him is becoming ridiculous (more on this later), but he needs people to work for him, so... fine. He gets a pass. This time. I also bought his mercy with regards to the Kingdomers. They follow a man called Ezekiel, who is king because he decided one day to proclaim himself King. They\u2019re clearly buffoons. It\u2019s feasible Negan sees them as easy marks; people who\u2019d fall under his dictatorship pliantly and without incident. Another pass here. The point Negan\u2019s capacity to forgive became ridiculous was in his leniency towards Maggie, Jesus, some bloke called Neil and the rest of the Hilltop convoy. Negan needs the supplies the Hilltop provides. We understand. But if Hilltop\u2019s inhabitants have proven themselves to be this much trouble \u2013 and by this point, \u201ckilling Saviors\u201d might as well be listed as a hobby on their Tinder profiles \u2013 why not simply wipe them out and replace them with some loyal Savior droogs? While it\u2019s always great to see the evil Simon (and he was on his most evilly evil form tonight) it was slightly jarring that, immediately following a conversation about how The Hilltoppers wouldn\u2019t surrender without a fight, they immediately surrendered to Simon without a fight. We could sit here and pontificate all day about how Simon knew exactly when and where to T-bone Jerry\u2019s car, to chop down that tree on the exact road Jesus would choose, and then to hide and wait for the Hilltop convoy to pass so he could box them in. We could also all join together in a rousing chorus of \u201cWho the Hell is Neil?\u201d, and not care in unison that some random dude called Neil was shot. But both would be fruitless. Instead, I took pleasure in the fact that Maggie had no intention of ever giving up. For the second time this season it\u2019s Maggie who does the unexpected, with both logic and bad-assery as her allies. Refreshing. Along with Aaron and Enid\u2019s snafu with the shooting of a certain grandma, Maggie\u2019s FU to the Saviors is one of the more interesting threads left dangling for the second half of the season. One more Savior dead, though, and all because Negan \u2013 stupid, forgiving, kind Negan \u2013 chose to let Maggie live. I\u2019m starting to think he\u2019s actually terrible at his job. Which brings us to the long-awaited stand-off between Negan and Rick. Was it the brutal, definitive showdown fans have been waiting for? The collision of fire and ice; the culmination of two seasons of swirling, swelling, seething hatred? No. And it was clearly never intended to be. Negan\u2019s just deserts are obviously being held back for the season finale proper, meaning there was a dramatic gap here \u2013 one that needed to be plugged by something ostensibly weighty but of little actual consequence. So we got a punch-up, a nice moment when Rick grabbed Lucille much to Negan\u2019s chagrain, and some smashed furniture. That\u2019s it. There was never any question of it coming to anything more. Which made it both daftly enjoyable and anticlimactic in the extreme. Rick was thrown through the window with his gun in his hand. He could have got to his feet, turned around, and shot at Negan until he was very dead indeed. It felt like a cheap way to deliver something while actually giving us nothing at all. Better moments came with Dwight\u2019s ultimate betrayal of the Saviors, Ezekiel\u2019s kingly sacrifice, and Eugene\u2019s semi-salvation in letting Gabriel and the doctor leave to attend to the still-not-very-pregnant-looking Maggie. But, ultimately, the episode belongs to the eyepatch emo extraordinaire himself, Mr Carl Grimes. I wasn\u2019t expecting him to be the sacrificial lamb this season \u2013 particularly as a cursory glance across to the comics tells you he\u2019s still alive. So kudos to the show for producing a genuine rug-pull, even if the episode around it was flawed. He\u2019s grown on me over the years, has Carl, and I expected him to continue to do so. We\u2019ll see more of him in the episodes to come, no doubt, as Rick and co bicker about who will get to plunge a knife in his brain, but his eventual death will surely have huge ramifications when the show returns. As for now, How It\u2019s Gotta Be pretty neatly summed up the first half of season eight as a whole. It had great moments, bad moments, exciting moments and stupid moments. It was good, but not that good. It did its job. And sometimes that\u2019s enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
