It\u2019s always possible that women will treasure forever something costing less than a bus fare, I suppose. But let\u2019s just say few of us are likely to be handing the \u00a31 black two-piece launched by the cut-price online retailer Missguided this week down to our daughters. This is practically the dictionary definition of throwaway fashion, stuff designed to be worn a couple of times and chucked at the end of the summer. It\u2019s pitched as a bit of fun, but when you factor in the environmental cost of making the fabric (polyester can be made from oil byproducts or recycled plastics), shipping the bikini from wherever it\u2019s sewn together and ultimately burying it in landfill \u2013 suddenly it doesn\u2019t seem quite so feel-good. That\u2019s why any government serious about reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 and nudging us all into a more environmentally sustainable lifestyle should be taking fashion \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most polluting industries \u2013 seriously. Unfortunately, this week ministers finally responded to the environmental audit committee\u2019s report on cleaning up fast fashion by flatly rejecting it. The cross-party committee, chaired by Labour\u2019s Mary Creagh, had wanted a penny tax on every garment sold in order to fund recycling initiatives, plus a ban on incinerating unwanted clothes. (The dirty secret of many an expensive label is that they would rather protect the brand\u2019s reputation by burning stuff that hasn\u2019t sold). It also wanted action to prevent plastic microfibres \u2013 which are shed by manmade materials when they go through the washing machine \u2013 polluting rivers and seas, plus tax breaks for developing more sustainable clothes. But ministers are broadly having none of it: some kind of waste tax might be considered in a few years\u2019 time if nothing has happened, but otherwise the government would clearly rather let the industry evolve voluntarily. To be fair to retailers, change is starting to happen on the high street in response to pressure from the climate strike generation of consumers. There\u2019s a long way to go still but Primark has brought out sustainable cotton jeans and pyjamas, while H&amp;M has its Conscious range of more eco-friendly options. Ministers may also be wary of heaping fresh regulatory costs on a struggling high street, with Philip Green\u2019s totemic Arcadia empire wobbling dangerously close to the edge in recent weeks. But the big names are also under pressure from upstarts like Missguided, which sells clothes at prices the established chains surely can\u2019t match if they\u2019re going to clean up their acts. The select committee reserved its sternest criticism for online-only retailers, which seek to stand out in a crowded market with loss leaders heavily promoted on young women\u2019s social media feeds \u2013 a dress for a fiver, a bikini for a quid. This isn\u2019t about families hunting out bargains to make their budgets stretch, a practical necessity that the eco-conscious middle classes too often gloss over, but about making it all too easy to buy stuff nobody really needs. And any government serious \u2013 as this one keeps saying it is \u2013 about saving the planet should do more than sit back and watch it happen. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
