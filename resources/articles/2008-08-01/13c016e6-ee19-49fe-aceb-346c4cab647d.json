Mills said at the weekend that the 100m world record-holder would compete at that distance along with the 200m, his favoured event, after weeks of speculation about his Olympic plans. Bolt leaves such decisions to Mills but, having said he was \"80% sure\" of doubling up, the 21-year-old looked surprised when he was told the news. \"After hearing what my coach has been saying, now I am 100% certain,\" Bolt said. \"We have a great relationship. He is like my second father. I really don't have a problem. This is the first miscommunication that I have ever had with my coach and I hope it never happens again. I have been conditioning myself all year in case I plan to run the double. I have been doing 200m and 100m over the season. I am used to the heats. I don't think it will take too much out of me.\" Bolt, a world junior 200m champion, ran 9.72sec in New York to break the 100m world record in May. The Jamaican 4x100m relay team member Julien Dunkley said he had been told that he had failed a drugs test at Jamaica's national championships in June and would not be competing in Beijing. Dunkley, 32, was told his A sample had tested positive for an undisclosed substance, reported to be the anabolic steroid boldenone. \"I will request that the B sample gets tested as I have never taken drugs in my life and I don't know about this drug,\" he said. Two of Bolt's rivals for Olympic sprint gold, Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell, will go head-to-head in the 100m at the British Grand Prix in Gateshead on August 31, two weeks after the Olympic final. Gay, the world champion, was due to race Powell at last month's London Grand Prix but withdrew with a hamstring problem. Powell won in 9.94sec. \"It was just too much of a risk for me to run in London and I apologise to the British fans for not running there,\" Gay said. \"But I promise I will make it up to them in Gateshead.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
