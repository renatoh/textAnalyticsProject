And that was a bit wrinkly.\u201d Everything has changed since then, especially this year, thanks to the flexitarian boom. Vegans who once relied on ingenuity and Linda McCartney\u2019s sausages can now pick from a cornucopia of Christmas treats, because half the UK population is cutting back on meat or giving it up, according to market analysts Mintel. Supermarkets have responded by boosting their plant-based ranges for Christmas. In 2018, Morrisons sold eight Christmas vegan items \u2013 now it offers 45, with three centrepieces, including a layered vegetable tart and a creamy mushroom Wellington. Waitrose has doubled its Christmas range from six to 12 products, adding the \u201croot en croute\u201d \u2013 a confection of roasted carrots \u2013 to the \u201cbeet\u201d Wellington that was so popular last Christmas that it became a year-round line. Tesco sells six vegan centrepieces, up from four, including a sweet potato and red cabbage Christmas log, and its Christmas report says that a third of families will have some sort of vegetarian or vegan option this year.Marks &amp; Spencer says there has been a \u201cconsiderable increase\u201d in its vegan Christmas offerings this year, and Aldi has a large range of vegan party food, crowned by a Christmas pastry wreath filled with chestnut mushrooms and butternut squash. A year ago, the only option in Iceland was a less than festive \u201cno turkey\u201d meal for one, but now it offers five vegan lines, including the \u201cno moo chocolate snowflakes\u201d mousse, caramel and biscuit dessert. \u201cIt\u2019s just been amazing. There\u2019s anything you can think of,\u201d said Bishop-Weston, reeling off a list of vegan \u201ccheeses\u201d available \u2013 gorgonzola, goat\u2019s cheese, brie and camembert \u2013 that have nothing to do with goats, sheep or cows. \u201cI\u2019m really struggling to find anything to moan about now,\u201d joked the vegan chef and cookery writer. \u201cThere\u2019s five blue cheeses. A guy in France is making smoked salmon with pea protein and algae \u2013 Odontella. It\u2019s got the same mouthfeel, the same flavours \u2013 it\u2019s amazing.\u201d It has been an extraordinary year for veganism, which has seen \u201can explosion in attention\u201d, according to Ryan Whittaker, consumer analyst at GlobalData. \u201cWaterstones has 3,545 book titles with the word \u2018vegan\u2019 in them available for sale, as of October 2019, compared with 944 in August 2018,\u201d he said. That attention from consumers has been followed by retailers. In the first 11 months of the year, the Vegan Society registered 14,262 new products under its Vegan Trademark scheme, twice as many as last year and a huge rise compared with the 5,919 that came out in 2015. In fact, 24% of all food products launched in 2019 in the UK have claimed to be vegan, according to Edward Bergen, global food and drink analyst at Mintel, the market research firm. It\u2019s a huge jump on the 8% of launches in 2015, and more than anywhere else in the world. \u201cThis whole trend isn\u2019t about the vegans, although they\u2019re loving the journey,\u201d Bergen said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the consumers reducing the amount of meat they eat.\u201d It\u2019s likely that more people will swap meat canap\u00e9s for things such as M&amp;S\u2019s No-Pork Pigs in Duvets, or add a vegan option alongside meat at large gatherings. \u201cIn a best-case scenario, it would be good to cook food from scratch, but the increasing numbers of vegan products available makes it easier for people to make vegan choices on Christmas Day,\u201d said Heather Russell, a dietitian for the Vegan Society. People who do want to cook from scratch their vegan Christmas dinner should think about colour, according to Bishop-Weston. \u201cI like to do individual centrepieces because, no matter how beautiful you make it in the middle of the table, once you start cutting into it, it\u2019s difficult to still be beautiful on the plate,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can make a little cracker out of filo pastry and you put some holly leaf and cranberries on top, and you tie the cracker with chives or slices of leaf. \u201cBut if I\u2019m doing a big centrepiece, I often do a pie or Wellington and try to make it pretty by putting layers in, something like kale and cranberry or red cabbage. You\u2019ve got those Christmas colours coming through, so, when you slice it, it\u2019s still looking pretty on the plate.\u201d Top treats Heppi Vegan BBQ ribs made from peas Available in 2020 Solmon Vegan smoked salmon, made from algae Available at GreenBay supermarket Sj\u00f6rapport seaweed pearls Vegan caviar made from kelp seaweed Available at Ikea Tofurky roast and gravy Vegan turkey joint Available from Ocado Mouse\u2019s Favourite Vegan camembert-style cheese made from cashew nuts Available at TheVeganKind supermarket"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
