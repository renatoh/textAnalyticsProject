The company will increase its prices for domestic electricity and gas customers on January 1 2006. Prices for electricity customers will rise between 8.9% and 12% and the price rise for gas customers will be 13.6%. The news comes just weeks after rival firm Scottish Power announced electricity prices would rise between 5% and 8%, depending on payment method and region, and gas by 12%. SSE said it had frozen prices for as long as possible but it had been forced to pass on some of the wholesale increase on to customers. The firm last announced a price rise in February this year. However, SSE claimed that, despite the increase, electricity prices for domestic customers would still be lower in real terms than they were in 1996. Customers on its Energyplus care tariff will have their price rise delayed until April 2006. SSE is also introducing a capped price offer for dual fuel customers paying their bills by direct debit. Under the offer, customers pay a 4% increase on the January 2006 electricity prices and a 7% increase on gas, which will be capped until February 2008. SSE's energy supply director Alistair Phillips-Davies said: \"SSE seeks to adopt a responsible approach to domestic energy prices, protecting customers from the worst impacts of high and volatile wholesale prices. \"The pressure of high wholesale prices cannot, however, be withstood indefinitely and we have come to the point where these price rises are unavoidable.\" Graham Kerr of the consumer watchdog Energywatch Scotland said: \"That prices are going up at a time of year when energy consumption increases and there is predicted to be a colder than average winter is at best unfortunate. \"Energywatch is particularly concerned that SSE has not significantly cushioned the blow for customers who have remained loyal to the company and never switched.\" He said the price rise meant SSE had moved from being the second cheapest electricity supplier to be the most expensive in the country.
