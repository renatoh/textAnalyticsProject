The chestnut colt, trained by Bob Baffert and rode by Mike Smith, was installed as the 4-5 morning-line favorite despite pulling the dreaded one slot in Tuesday\u2019s draw at Citi Field ahead of the New York Mets\u2019 game with the Baltimore Orioles. \u201cI never do like to draw the rail,\u201d Baffert said. \u201cMy horses seem to live in it. We have it, can\u2019t change it, have to deal with it. \u201cI just feel like most importantly the horse is doing well.\u201d The son of Scat Daddy will attempt to become the first three-year-old to sweep the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont, America\u2019s three most celebrated races, since American Pharoah ended a 37-year drought three years ago \u2013 and only the second since Affirmed in 1978. The most likely spoiler in the well-rested 10-horse field, which features only two challengers that ran in the Preakness three weeks ago, is second choice Hofburg, the seventh-place finisher in the Derby who opens at 9-2. Vino Rosso and Preakness runner-up Bravazo both were installed at 8-1. The rest of the field is 12-1 or longer. \u201cI think, like all of us, we need Justify to wake up on the wrong side of the bed to have a chance,\u201d said Todd Pletcher, the trainer of Vino Rosso and Noble Indy with three previous Belmont wins to his name. Should Justify pull off the historic bid in the one-and-a-half-mile Belmont, the third and most difficult of the Triple Crown legs staged at the venerable race course just outside New York city limits, the colt will set a record for number of rivals defeated with the storied feat on the line. Justify, who is undefeated in five outings, had been regarded as a freakish talent but an untested one until he ended a 136-year-old hoodoo at the Kentucky Derby on 5 May with his fourth win in as many tries, running from the No7 post on a sloppy track and becoming the first horse to win the famed race at Churchill Downs having not raced as a two-year-old since 1882. He followed it up two weeks later at Pimlico, fending off an extended challenge from Good Magic in an enveloping fog on another muddy course, and also from the seven hole, to win by a half-length over Bravazo. Now he enters the $1.5m race at Belmont Park as America\u2019s next great equine sensation, looking to join a famous roll of thoroughbreds to capture the Triple Crown that includes Sir Barton (1919), Gallant Fox (1930), Omaha (1935), War Admiral (1937), Whirlaway (1941), Count Fleet (1943), Assault (1946), Citation (1948), Secretariat (1973), Seattle Slew (1977), Affirmed (1978) and American Pharoah (2015). Baffert, who was scheduled to throw out the ceremonial first pitch before Tuesday night\u2019s game, can become only the second trainer to saddle more than one Triple Crown winner after \u2018Sunny\u2019 Jim Fitzsimmons, who trained Gallant Fox and Omaha. Additionally, Justify will attempt to become the only undefeated horse besides Seattle Slew to achieve what has long been considered among the most difficult feats in all of sport: winning three prestigious races at varying lengths in three different states over a five-week span. Justify is scheduled to arrive at Belmont Park on Wednesday afternoon after traveling on a special transport plane from Louisville International Airport to Long Island\u2019s MacArthur Airport in the morning. \u201cHe\u2019s doing well,\u201d said Baffert, who will also send out longshot Restoring Hope in Saturday\u2019s main event. \u201cSo I think we just \u2013 once he gets here tomorrow, we won\u2019t feel until he gets on that plane and gets here, so we still have a few days to go \u2013 but everything has been really smooth since the Preakness, so we\u2019re happy about that.\u201d A total of 23 horses have taken the Belmont from the No1 post since records were kept in 1905, making it the winningest post position. But none have won from the rail since Empire Maker in 2003. The full slate of post positions and morning-line odds was revealed on Tuesday afternoon: No1 Justify (4-5), No2 Free Drop Billy (30-1), No3 Bravazo (8-1), No4 Hofburg (9-2), No5 Restoring Hope (30-1), No6 Gronkowski (12-1), No7 Tenfold (12-1), No8 Vino Rosso (8-1), No9 Noble Indy (30-1), No10 Blended Citizen (15-1). The post time for the 150th running of the Belmont Stakes is 6.46pm ET."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
