Friday\u2019s incident prompted the Biden campaign to cancel at least two of its Texas events as Democrats accused the president of encouraging supporters to engage in acts of intimidation. \u201cFBI San Antonio is aware of the incident and investigating,\u201d special agent Michelle Lee, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in San Antonio, told Reuters in an email. \u201cNo further information is available at this time.\u201d In response to news of the FBI\u2019s investigation, Trump tweeted on Sunday night that the people involved in running the bus off the road were \u201cpatriots\u201d. A state representative and a witness said the caravan of Trump supporters in pickup trucks had come armed. \u201cArmed Trump trolls harassing Biden Bus on I35, ramming volunteer vehicles &amp; blocking traffic for 40 mins,\u201d Texas state representative Rafael Anch\u00eda wrote on Twitter. The historian Eric Cervini, who had flown to Texas to help with get-out-the-vote efforts, posted a video on Instagram that showed a long line of cars with Trump paraphernalia stalled along the highway, waiting for the Biden-Harris bus. \u201cThese Trump supporters, many of whom were armed, surrounded the bus on the interstate and attempted to drive it off the road,\u201d he wrote, adding: \u201cAs a historian who studied the rise of the Third Reich, I can tell you: this is how a democracy dies.\u201d The ambush, which took place on Friday as the bus traveled from San Antonio to Austin to conclude a three-day tour, included a crash between a white SUV and a black truck, police in San Marcos confirmed, though it was still unclear who caused the collision. Officers there had tried to provide a police escort for the Biden-Harris bus but were not able to catch up because of traffic. Even as dramatic footage from the scene caused widespread alarm, President Donald Trump threw his support behind the so-called Trump train, tweeting \u201cI LOVE TEXAS!\u201d Earlier on Sunday, he asked supporters at a rally in Michigan: \u201cDid you see the way our people \u2026 were\u2026 protecting this bus ... because they\u2019re nice. They had hundreds of cars. Trump! Trump! Trump and the American flag.\u201d Trump also said Biden supporters lacked such spirit and enthusiasm. One Texas Republican official, Naomi Narvaiz, applauded the caravan\u2019s tactics to force the bus to leave: \u201cYour kind aren\u2019t welcome here!\u201d \u201cFunniest thing I\u2019ve ever seen, man!\u201d a Facebook user recording from New Braunfels guffawed in a video posted on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re, like, literally escorting him out of town.\u201d A spokeswoman for Living Blue in Comal county, a local progressive group, told the Guardian the incident was a reflection of larger problems in the area, where \u201cracist\u201d locals \u201cjust kind of run this town, like the Klan did\u201d. The spokeswoman, who asked to remain anonymous because she feared being targeted, added: \u201cThey\u2019ve dragged the BLM flag. They\u2019ve called people the N-word from their truck. So it\u2019s straight up harassment and intimidation. And then, to see President Trump validate them by retweeting their video and saying he loves Texas, he\u2019s basically endorsing domestic terrorism.\u201d Amid safety concerns, Democrats in Texas cancelled multiple events. According to the Texas Tribune, the FBI was investigating. The president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr, had previously encouraged members of the Trump train in Texas to \u201cget out there\u201d and \u201chave some fun\u201d at the expense of vice- presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who was campaigning in the state but was not on the bus when the incident occurred. Two days out from election day, Texas is close, Trump leading Biden by 1.5 points, according to the FiveThirtyEight.com polling average. Tariq Thowfeek, Texas communications director for the Biden campaign, said in a statement: \u201cRather than engage in productive conversation about the drastically different visions that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have for our country, Trump supporters in Texas instead decided to put our staff, surrogates, supporters, and others in harm\u2019s way.\u201d US representative Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat who represents constituents from San Antonio to Austin, said: \u201cThis aggressive, abusive conduct by his supporters results from Trump continuing to incite acts of intimidation and violence. We have to stand up to these bullies just as we seek to protect the right of every last Texan to vote out the Bully-in-Chief.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
