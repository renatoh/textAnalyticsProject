The England manager lost Joe Gomez to a horror knee injury in training on Wednesday \u2013 a setback that threatens to end the Liverpool centre-half\u2019s season and has deepened his club\u2019s defensive selection crisis. But as Southgate prepared for Thursday night\u2019s Wembley friendly against the Republic of Ireland, it was the Clarke fiasco that cast long shadows. The 63-year-old had caused offence with a string of comments in front of MPs on the digital, culture, media and sport committee. He referred to black players as \u201ccoloured\u201d; suggested \u201cdifferent career interests\u201d led south Asian people to chose careers in IT over sport; said girl footballers did not like the ball to be hit at them and described a gay player coming out as a \u201clife choice\u201d. Southgate said: \u201cThe terminology he used in a number of areas was not acceptable and doesn\u2019t reflect the view of the FA, it doesn\u2019t reflect what we as a team stand for. I don\u2019t think he had any alternative but to take the decision he did to resign. Unfortunately, he\u2019s going to be remembered for the comments he\u2019s made.\u201d Southgate had overseen a squad meeting on Monday to discuss the recently introduced FA Diversity Code, into which he and a number of his players, including the captain, Harry Kane, Jordan Henderson and Tyrone Mings, had fed ideas. He felt the need to address them again, speaking \u201cfrom the heart\u201d after Clarke\u2019s resignation. \u201cI know there\u2019s a view of what the forward face of the FA is but there are 800 people here and it\u2019s as diverse an organisation as I\u2019ve ever been part of,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cInternally there was a lot of upset about what had been said. I think Greg recognised that amongst all the other challenges that what he said would have provided, the upset internally was massive.\u201d Southgate said the FA\u2019s next chair did not have to be a former player but that there ought to be a football person on the board. He name-checked Paul Elliott, the chair of the inclusion advisory board, who also sits on the FA\u2019s board although without voting powers, as the type of committed football administrator that the organisation needed. Southgate said that he was not saying Elliott should be the next chair. Southgate was asked whether Clarke\u2019s successor ought to be black or female. \u201cWe have a lot of black and female staff at the FA and they would all say that what they would want would be the right person for the role,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd that could be anybody from any background, of any gender. \u201cI could easily grandstand here and say: \u2018Yes, it should be somebody from one part of the community,\u2019 but I don\u2019t think that would be correct either. There\u2019s a bigger message. As an organisation we have to change. We can\u2019t keep talking about it and not enforcing it.\u201d Gomez has not yet had scans on his damaged knee but it is clear that Southgate and the rest of the squad fear the worst for a luckless player who missed the 2018 World Cup through injury. Southgate said it was \u201cnot a good situation\u201d and talked of \u201cpraying\u201d for a positive diagnosis. The Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope, who will start against Ireland, added: \u201cJoe made a pass or a movement with no one around him and ended up on the floor. He was in a great deal of pain. When you see one of your friends or teammates go through that, it\u2019s not easy.\u201d Liverpool, who sold the centre-half Dejan Lovren in July and did not sign cover, are already without their star central defender Virgil van Dijk (knee ligaments) and the full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold (calf). Fabinho, who has played at centre-half, is recovering from a hamstring injury. Southgate said he had given Gomez an extra day of recovery as he was mindful of the player\u2019s physical exertions in recent weeks and yet \u201cthis has still happened\u201d. He added that there was \u201cnothing we would have done differently.\u201d \u201cThe bigger picture is that governing bodies need to work together,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWith a winter World Cup in 2022, there was an opportunity this year to think differently but everybody\u2019s tried to cram the programme into a smaller period. Nobody has given way, people haven\u2019t collaborated enough. We\u2019re now trying to affect things too late. \u201cWe are going to see injuries and it\u2019s a desperately sad situation. A lot of these discussions could have happened in the summer. We could have delayed the start of the league, we could have delayed international football.\u201d Southgate said he expected to learn on Thursday whether Wembley can stage next Wednesday\u2019s Nations League game against Iceland, amid concerns over a new coronavirus strain in Denmark. Iceland are scheduled to play in Denmark on Sunday. If Wembley cannot host, Southgate said the game was likely to be switched to Germany."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
