But to supporters, it is the catalyst for romantic reconciliations, marriage and babies, and a valuable tool for detectives and journalists in tracking people down. What is clear is that Friends Reunited has become much more than a method of contacting old schoolfriends to boast about vast wealth and incredible success in later life. Police forces across the UK routinely use it to trace criminals, particularly in difficult investigations such as those involving child abuse. Journalists also use the site to get information about people in the news. When Abigail Witchalls was stabbed in the village of Little Bookham, Surrey, in April, details of her Friends Reunited entry were published in some newspapers. And at the height of the London terror attacks, journalists used the site to find out about the victims and the bombers. Friends Reunited started life five years ago today in Julie Pankhurst's back bedroom in a suburban semi in Barnet, north London. It was conceived to help equip Mrs Pankhurst, who was on maternity leave, brush up her IT skills for her return to work. But it has become one of the biggest success stories of the dotcom age. Five years on, there are 12 million registered users of Friends Reunited (half of UK households with internet access). Police in Wiltshire used it to capture a paedophile teacher, who was later convicted of 54 sex abuse charges against boys over a 15-year period. Peter Hamilton-Leggett, 58, was jailed for eight years at Swindon crown court in June 2003. He was brought to justice after former students at the Olde Ride prep school in Bradford-on-Avon saw a police appeal for help. Officers posted a message asking: \"Do you have anything you want to tell police?\" Detective Sergeant David Martin of Wiltshire police said yesterday that Hamilton-Leggett would not have been convicted without Friends Reunited, which had been \"absolutely invaluable\". Hamilton-Leggett had twice previously been the focus of police investigations into alleged sex abuse but had never been brought to justice. Det Sgt Martin was commended by the trial judge for his professional and persistent work in the investigation. \"One of the problems we had was that the school had closed at least 10 years previously and was being used as a commune. The former headmaster lived abroad, so there were no school records.\" He said 19 victims of abuse came forward with evidence. \"At the end of the day, it was very satisfying to know that someone who had got away with abuse for 30 years had finally been brought to justice,\" he said. Detectives investigating the murder of Alistair Wilson, 30, in Nairn, have assigned a colleague to use the website to trace the dead man's friends and acquaintances from school and university. Mr Wilson, a bank manager, was shot after his wife, Veronica, answered the door to a short, stocky man in his late 30s. In an interview, Detective Chief Inspector Peter MacPhee, who is leading the investigation, said they did not know why Mr Wilson was killed. \"We started off with immediate friends and associates, but we are now having to probe deeper and go further back into his past,\" he said. \"The people he knew at university and before could hold the clue to why he was killed. We are using the Friends Reunited site to identify people who knew him.\" When Carl Wallace decided to get married again, he wasted no time in letting his old pals know via the site. \"Now living in Oldham and working as a maintenance supervisor for a major maintenance company,\" he wrote. \"I am due to get married in September in Italy.\" But his wife of more than 20 years, Anne, was not impressed. She contacted police and he was arrested and charged with bigamy. He was given a suspended jail sentence. Another boast on the site led to a drug dealer being jailed. Raymond Casling, 24, wrote: \"I'm doing very well. I'm selling a lot of Charlie [cocaine] in Redcar and I've got three sports cars.\" At the time, he was earning \u00a345 a week working in a seafront amusement arcade. He was jailed for three years. Annette and Simon Smyth, from Milton Keynes had dated as 12-year-olds and got back in touch through Friends Reunited. Mrs Smyth said: \"We got back together about four years ago. \"I saw from his details that he had divorced. My husband had left me in 2000 and I had a young daughter. When I look back now at when we were younger, it was more of a friendship than a relationship. \"We spent lots of summers together going to the roller-skating rink.\" The couple met up again in a coffee shop. Mr Smyth had a new haircut and contact lenses instead of glasses. \"He looked quite different,\" said Mrs Smyth. \"Before, he used to look quite nerdy at school.\" The couple had their son, Dylan, in August 2002 and were married in May 2003. According to Andrew Collins, the author of Friends Reunited: Remarkable Real-Life Stories from the Nation's Favourite Website, the site was born during a millennium nostalgia fest, when images of spacehoppers and soda streams were everywhere. In 2001 the message board had to be pulled for two months after site managers were threatened with legal action if they did not remove offensive comments about certain teachers. Arthur Cassidy, a social psychologist at Belfast Institute who specialises in inter-group conflict, said websites such as Friends Reunited had \"severe implications for the human psyche\". \"Because of the easy access to the internet, it can become an extremely abnormal and sadistic means of assassinating people's personality,\" Dr Cassidy said. \"It has been a very destructive mechanism in the break-up of relationships,\" he said. \"We do not have to meet face-to-face on the internet and it can be very deceptive. \"It is frightening that you can find information about people in milliseconds. So much extremely valuable information about their lives is exposed to the world.\" Small beginnings in a north London semi \u00b7 The site was set up in July 2000 from Julie and Steve Pankhurst's suburban semi in Barnet, north London. Weeks later, one of the first members emailed to say he had had a reunion with a school friend from 30 years ago \u00b7 By December 2000, more than 3,000 people were registered as members \u00b7 In February 2001, a \u00a35 charge was introduced as the website had become a full-time job for the Pankhursts and they need the revenue \u00b7 Friends Reunited's first brush with controversy came in November 2001, when teachers' unions complained about postings on the site. Message boards were temporarily taken down, but reinstated a month later \u00b7 One million members were registered by August 2001, and the site was receiving up to 5m hits a day \u00b7 In May 2002, it was involved in an case which made legal history. Jim Murray, 68, a former teacher, sued former pupil Jonathan Spencer over remarks made on the website. In winning \u00a31,250, Mr Murray became the first person to win damages for internet libel \u00b7 New sites were launched in Australia, South Africa and New Zealand in August 2002 \u00b7 The website's first baby was born to Simon and Annette Smyth, from Milton Keynes \u00b7 The first wedding, for Nigel Williams and Su Price, both in their 40s, took place in September 2002 \u00b7 In April this year a bigamist was caught after boasting on Friends Reunited about getting married to a woman 21 years his junior. Carl Wallace, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, was given a 16-week suspended sentence and fined \u00a3250 after his legal wife spotted his entry on the website and reported him to the police \u00b7 Today, there are more than 12 million members \u00b7 On average, 5,000 people register with the site every day \u00b7 An analysis of the millions of contact emails sent between users shows that the class of 1963 are the school leavers who keep in touch with each other the most \u00b7 Almost a million of the new users left school within the past five years"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
