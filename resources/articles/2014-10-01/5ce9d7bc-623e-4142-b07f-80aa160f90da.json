The floodlights blazed down on Spotland on a brilliant autumn afternoon. Keith Hill, their most successful manager ever, took a back seat behind his assistant, Chris Beech. And Barnsley, where he was less successful, ran off with all three points, scoring early and defending stoutly. Hill was not going to let the huge visiting support see his pain. \u201cIt was frustrating,\u201d said Beech. \u201cWe weren\u2019t quite on our \u2018A\u2019 game.\u201d Barnsley were on their \u2018A star\u2019. Danny Wilson, his opposite number, said: \u201cI think you\u2019ve seen a better reflection of who we are today.\u201d At kick-off Barnsley were in League One\u2019s relegation places and Rochdale fifth, four places higher than their best finish to a season. Now Dale are ninth and Barnsley four points behind with a game in hand. The days, getting shorter, are still early. Hill got Rochdale out of the fourth tier for the first time in 36 years in 2010. It was his first managerial post, third full season and followed two play-off disappointments. After narrowly keeping Barnsley in the Championship in his first season he left them in last place in December 2012, which is where Wilson picked them up a year later without immediate effect. Hill was back at Rochdale in a month and repeated his feat there in 16. Wilson, also a returning hero, has more of a challenge to match his main achievement at Oakwell. In 1997 he took Barnsley to the top tier for their only season there. A stream of strikers has recently passed through Rochdale to higher places \u2013 Rickie Lambert, Grant Holt, Adam Le Fondre, Glenn Murray \u2013 many with gratitude to Hill\u2019s tuition. The manager took Matty Done to Barnsley and back and the current partnership with Ian Henderson has produced 12 goals out of 19. But Dale have scored only six at home and, for all the good movement of the front pair, little headway was made on Saturday. The midfield support, epitomised by the terrier Stephen Dawson and described by Beech as \u201ca congruent effort far stronger than an individual\u201d, seldom suggested penetration from elsewhere as Barnsley, marshalled by Peter Ramage on fresh loan from Crystal Palace, cut off all avenues before real danger. Ramage also headed the goal from six yards at a corner, asking questions of the keeper, Conrad Logan, all in yellow. The answer looked like a lemon. Textiles rather than football established Rochdale on the map. When the Third Divisions North and South were reformed in 1958, the club were put in the Third and lost no time in being relegated. In 1959 the town\u2019s Gracie Fields had a hit with Little Donkey, possibly inspired by an inside- forward, and Dale have seldom left the fourth tier since. With Hill back as part of the fabric they deserve more than home support of 2,500. The chairman, Chris Dunphy, locally born and wealthy through church heating, brings stable ambition. Spotland is an ancient miniature and modern gem with three even stands and a covered end terrace, backed by hardwoods. The crown green bowlers deliver their woods elsewhere now but children still stoop to conker and pubs have evocative names like the Clog and Shawl and the Cemetery. The game\u2019s pace was hectic. If only Hill had seen the measured spin of the wind turbines up on Scout Moor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
