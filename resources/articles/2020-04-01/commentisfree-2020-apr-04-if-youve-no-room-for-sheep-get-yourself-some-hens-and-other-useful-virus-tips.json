And other useful virus tips", "bodyText": "With classic plague literature now fairly thoroughly mined for instructive similarities with our current predicament \u2013 official cover-ups, forced isolation, mad clerics, makeshift burials, heavy-handed policing etc \u2013 perhaps it is time to turn to some of the differences. One of the major ones being, of course, the earlier absence of influencers. As terrifying as it would have been for anyone stuck in the London described by Defoe or inside Camus\u2019s Oran, these imprisoned citizens were, at least, spared survival tips dreamed up in the remote homes and gardens of fund managers, celebrity chefs, professional tidier-uppers, titled brand ambassadors, \u201ctablescaping\u201d experts. You might be banged up, scared and brooding on things left undone and unsaid, in 1665, but at least nobody thought this was the perfect time to inform you that \u201cthis period of self-isolation is a good chance to experiment with more decadent table settings\u201d. Yes, even if you are alone, mid-virus. \u201cAt a moment like this,\u201d the same connoisseur continues, \u201cquirky tableware is particularly uplifting.\u201d We can\u2019t be sure, admittedly, that daily bulletins on the lockdown habits of more successful 17th-century people, on matters such as skincare (\u201cthere\u2019s been no better time than now to look after number one\u201d) and a new, working from home wardrobe (\u201cyes, you\u2019re confined. Your style needn\u2019t be\u201d) wouldn\u2019t have made pestilence and economic catastrophe more endurable, even for those unable to sit it out in Oxford or Salisbury. \u201cHas there ever,\u201d suggests Samuel Pepys, \u201cbeen a better time to organise your old wigs?\u201d Today, there are presumably people confined to garden-less flats with hostile fellow-occupants who find that articles such as \u201cWhy we decided not to self-isolate in our Cornwall holiday home\u201d, along with joyous diaries from isolated mansions (\u201cI\u2019m also planting a vegetable garden\u201d) are just the thing \u2013 like the government\u2019s separate bathroom advice \u2013 to get them through another day of confinement. Maybe people don\u2019t need, personally, to feel blessed in the face of illness and redundancy, to benefit from the example of busy professionals for whom, it emerges, the ideal isolated day might begin with entries in a gratitude notebook. Has there ever been a better time to start one? As for material, the FT\u2019s Marie Kondo-inspired hints on gratitude practice (as a means to finding \u201cjoy at work in the age of coronavirus\u201d) include \u201cbe thankful for being healthy\u201d. No disrespect to Kondo, whose tidying is unrivalled, but, as with fellow influencers, some of her hints could challenge civilians now dependent for survival on universal credit or facing other threats \u2013 from abuse to overcrowding \u2013 to their gratitude or online shopping practice. Maybe it\u2019s because this contagion\u2019s projected remedy - self-isolation - is situated, literally, in the world of interiors, that the restrictions have been so widely understood as an athleisure-buying/self-care/crafting/decluttering opportunity, as opposed to an impending economic catastrophe. But maybe I\u2019ve forgotten similarly abundant guidance on fermenting turnips, dumping cleaners and gratitude practice after the 2008 banking collapse, generally from the very people it was least likely to touch. While some of our more fatuous celebrities seem to have piped down a bit, since contributions including Madonna\u2019s from her bath and David Geffen\u2019s from his yacht helped propel the hashtag #guillotine2020, the stream of virus-inspired lifestyle advice on things it has never been a better time to do has gone ever more Marie Antoinette. \u201cIt suddenly makes sense,\u201d city dwellers without the space for a flock of sheep are told, \u201cto own hens.\u201d Both UK lives and the UK economy were already imperilled on 17 March, the day after shutdown, when the revered fund manager Dame Helena Morrissey drew on her long experience of getting dressed and sometimes working from home to reach out. \u201cTake time to do your hair and makeup as usual,\u201d she advised on her Instagram account. Avoid black - \u201ctoo draining for most of us on video\u201d \u2013 and white - \u201ctoo stark\u201d. With this additional explanation for the gender pay gulf: \u201cI\u2019ve learned,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthat a jewel-coloured poloneck with a necklace looks both polished and appropriate for remote meetings.\u201d Definitely something to try when this is over. Among those professionally supplying emergency lockdown hints is Kirstie Allsopp, whose early retreat to a spare home in Devon, with an infected partner \u2013 \u201cHeather, our nanny, is still in Lanzarote\u201d \u2013 was widely covered. Channel 4 recruited Jamie Oliver, 1,000 of whose staff lost their jobs last year, to provide recipes \u201cspecifically tailored for the unique times we\u2019re living in\u201d. Oliver, now fully regenerated as a country squire, approaches this solemn task from a gigantic house that mercifully survived the collapse of his restaurant group with \u00a371.5m debts. The Sun took the chance to show readers \u201cinside Jamie Oliver\u2019s incredible \u00a36 million Essex country pad where he\u2019s isolating with Jules and his kids\u201d. \u201cWho better than Jamie to help us all navigate the day-to-day challenge of eating well and feeding our families?\u201d asked a Channel 4 person, who must have known that the obvious answer was (before the BBC sensibly hired her) the brilliant @BootstrapCook. Jack Monroe once struggled to feed her child and has been characteristically generous in lockdown, tweeting uses for ancient/doomed-looking ingredients. And whose navigation could be worse? A tie, I\u2019d say, between Richard Branson and David Cameron, reaching out from island and hut respectively. Although special Marie Antoinette points for the members of the royal family photographed empathising in the country, while their London homes stand empty. It isn\u2019t that self-isolation wisdom and encouragement can\u2019t be comforting. I\u2019ve enjoyed, in particular, the Guardian\u2019s streaming gems, the Getty museum challenge and a terrific New Statesman compilation featuring Hilary Mantel\u2019s recourse to Ivy Compton-Burnettt, Anthony Powell and her old bottles of scent. Finally: something for my new gratitude notebook. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 April 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to Kirstie Allsopp\u2019s husband. In fact he is her partner. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
