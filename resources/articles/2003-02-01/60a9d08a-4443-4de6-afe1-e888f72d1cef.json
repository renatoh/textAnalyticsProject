His team had to settle for a draw against Ajax after taking the lead inside five minutes and have now gone four Champions League games at Highbury without a win. Ahead through Sylvain Wiltord and apparently cruising, a mistake by Ashley Cole allowed the Dutch champions an equaliser inside 20 minutes. Ajax showed their attacking talent in the first half but the second period was largely about their resilience as Arsenal poured forward. Wenger's players rarely tested an unconvincing goalkeeper, although Dennis Bergkamp hit a post. Thierry Henry was unusually quiet and Arsenal travel to Amsterdam next week in need of a win now that Highbury, once a European fortress, is losing its look of security. Things could have been worse had Nourdin Boukhari taken a late chance. The Tannoy announcer could not resist a sly mention of recent goings-on at Old Trafford beforehand, and may be forced to apologise. Explaining why Wenger would not be giving his usual pre-match interview on the big screens, he said: \"Mr Wenger has lost his voice, unlike Mr Ferguson, who's lost his head.\" The one pre-match disappointment for Wenger was that Martin Keown was unexpectedly forced out by a back injury, giving Pascal Cygan a start alongside Sol Campbell in the centre of defence. But the Arsenal manager doubtless expected his players to be little affected by that. They certainly made a perfect start, taking the lead with the sort of sweeping counter-attack which is their trademark. Ajax must have sensed little danger when they lost possession near the edge of Arsenal's box but in a few electrifying seconds, they were behind. Patrick Vieira transferred the ball to Bergkamp and the Dutchman, a former Ajax player, spotted Wiltord galloping unmarked down the right flank. The Frenchman accelerated into the box and finished through Bogdan Lobont's legs at the near post. Sadly for Wenger, that mental commitment soon slipped when a concentration lapse by Cole handed Ajax an equaliser. The left-back failed to cut out a long pass by Tomas Galasek and the 18-year-old Nigel de Jong took advantage by steering a shot past David Seaman. Suddenly Ajax were flush with confidence and pouring forward, with Campbell forced into important blocks. It was a marked contrast to most of the early exchanges which Arsenal had dominated, with Bergkamp and Robert Pires providing some excellent early touches. Vieira, too, started in commanding form and Arsenal gave the impression of being physically too strong for a young inexperienced Ajax team. Once level, the Dutch champions shed that look of inferiority, however. Perhaps Arsenal had fallen into the trap of coasting prematurely. Boosted by the goal, Ajax showed plenty of the passing ability and a technique which can make them dangerous. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Swede, occasionally caught the eye with his vision and Steven Pienaar epitomised his team's effort in midfield. Though Arsenal had more of the possession in a good open match, they struggled for clear chances until a spell of pressure approaching half-time. Ajax had Galasek shielding their back four and showed discipline in hauling men back. But a few times before the interval they almost conceded. The tireless Pires first shot wide and then wildly over from excellent positions. Finally the Frenchman failed to get a touch after Lobont saved from Henry. Seaman had not been too busy in the first 45 minutes but departed at half-time with a hip injury, necessitating the introduction of Stuart Taylor. He was a spectator initially as Arsenal continued to probe, with Pires still their liveliest presence as Galasek kept a close eye on Bergkamp at all times. Andy van der Meyde offered a reminder of Ajax's threat by shooting over the bar but Arsenal were almost exclusively on the front foot and came close to scoring after Lobont careered out of his area to clear but only found an opponent. In the ensuing panic, the keeper got back to save from Gilberto Silva after Pires crossed. Arsenal continued to make the running and knew they had to remain patient, rather than become frustrated, as the minutes ticked away. They also had to beware Ajax's counter-attacks, as was evidenced when Lauren was forced to knock a dangerous cross for a corner. Arsenal tried to find width but their high crosses were generally dealt with by Ajax and lower centres were flashing across the area without anyone managing a decisive touch. They really must have feared it was not their night when Bergkamp hit a post.
