But when the lives of athletes are being cut short from a cause that could be avoided it is tragedy in its most real sense. Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), the result of heart abnormalities, kills eight young people a week in the UK, most of them seemingly fit and many actively involved in sport. Post-mortem examinations have revealed that Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9 was the latest victim of the condition that is responsible for a growing death toll of sporting talent. John Marshall, a junior international footballer of the year, died when he was 16 on the day he was due to sign for Everton; Laura Moss was on the swimming squad for Sydney when she suffered a cardiac arrest at 13; Adrian Hawkins, 22, was on the short list for a place in Britain's cycling team at the Barcelona Olympics when he collapsed after a race; and Daniel Yorath, son of Terry, was 15 when he suffered SDS shortly after signing for Leeds United. It makes depressing reading, but so the list goes on. What it does provide, one would assume, is more than enough evidence to support a campaign launched by the charity Cry (Cardiac Risk in the Young) which aims to make heart screening mandatory in top-level sport. Although it does not cause SDS, sport can trigger it; the strain placed on the heart during intense physical activity often proves too much when there is an underlying problem with a thickened heart muscle or irregular heartbeat. In the next five years Cry wants testing for the syndrome introduced to elite youth squads and top individuals aged 16 and under in all sports. Eventually it hopes cardiac examinations will be made part of the government's national screening programme for young people. It is not as if we lack the means. Britain now has the only dedicated sports cardiology testing centre in the world at the Olympic Medical Institute in Northwick Park hospital, Harrow. Funded by Cry and coordinated by the exercise physiologist Dr Greg Whyte, it offers comprehensive scanning with a range of medical equipment that can determine whether or not someone is at risk. There are also mobile screening units providing the same service which can be transported to clubs and training grounds. But so far the services have been woefully under-used. Despite having such top-notch facilities and experts at their disposal, most governing bodies seem reluctant to employ them. A few do offer sporadic screening to selected squads but in typical piecemeal fashion. UK Athletics says it might refer an athlete if they have a history of heart problems in their family or if they display any recognisable symptoms. In 2002, following the deaths of several young players, an editorial in Cricket World called for heart screening to be made available to all young cricketers. So far, nothing. Only the Football Association, which carries out its own cardiac tests on 16-year-old youth trainees at all professional clubs, and the Lawn Tennis Association which works with Cry to screen all top players have instigated anything like acceptable measures. How different things are elsewhere. Most states in America operate some form of cardiac assessment for young athletes either at high school or university level. In Italy statistical data on cardiac-related deaths in athletes published a few years ago was considered convincing enough for mandatory testing to be introduced across the board in all sports. Now anyone representing the country must undergo heart screening and be issued with a fitness certificate before they are allowed to compete in Italian colours. Cardiologists are also integral members of the medical team at most Italian football clubs, an approach which has paid off on more than one occasion. Last week Internazionale's heart specialists reported they had found serious problems in their assessment of the Senegalese signing Khalilou Fadiga. Here cardiac testing is still considered a luxury. Cry subsidises the cost of screening so that it costs sports bodies no more than \u00a3200 per athlete. If that is too high a price to pay for saving a life then somewhere our approach to caring for young talent has gone terribly wrong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
