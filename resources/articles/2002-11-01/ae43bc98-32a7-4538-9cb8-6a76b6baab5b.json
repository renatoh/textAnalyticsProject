Fans in Germany watching the Group B game between the Italian side and Arsenal on Premiere cable channel were able to follow the game with the ITV commentary team. However, at half-time, instead of switching to adverts like the UK transmission, the broadcast in Germany stuck with the commentators who did not know they were still on air. Viewers heard the Guardian columnist and former Manchester United and Aston Villa manager say: \"Are there any sandwiches? I'm starving.\" Unimpressed with Totti's performance in a first half during which he had repeatedly dived, looking for free-kicks and a penalty, Big Ron reportedly said: \"He's a little twat, that Totti. I can't see what all the fuss is about.\" His more considered co-commentating colleague Clive Tyldesley countered: \"We haven't really seen the best of him.\" In between mouthfuls, Atkinson later praised Arsenal striker Thierry Henry and a resurgent Barcelona. But that's not nearly as interesting, is it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
