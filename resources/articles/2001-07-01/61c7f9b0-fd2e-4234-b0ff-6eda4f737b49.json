The League of Wales champions beat Shamkir 1-0 in Azerbaijan in the first qualifying round second leg. Having won the first leg 2-0, Lee Phillips's 57th-minute header in Baku put the game beyond the Azerbaijan champions, who had a player sent off after only 15 minutes. Early indications are that Barry will keep the home leg of the Porto tie at Jenner Park in a fortnight. The ground capacity could be boosted to 6,500 by temporary seating. That will be a culture shock for the Portuguese club, who won the treble of European Cup, Super Cup and World Club Cup in 1987. But first Barry must negotiate the opening leg in the imposing Antas stadium next Wednesday. Porto will be overwhelming favourites but Barry's manager Peter Nicholas, the former Arsenal and Wales midfielder, said: \"Whatever happens they can't take this result away from us. We have created history. \"From the moment they had their player sent off we had the game in our grasp. When we scored in the second half it was just a case of running the clock down because it was all over.\" Manchester United yesterday denied allegations that they made an illegal approach to the Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira, and the London club decided to make no formal complaint against their rivals. Arsenal's manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had accused United of breaking Premier League rules by trying to entice Vieira to Old Trafford without his club's permission, but United's chief executive Peter Kenyon denied any wrongdoing. \"I did speak to Arsenal in our interest and that was as far as it went,\" he said. \"We made it quite clear we were interested if the player were available. I approached the club and that was the correct procedure.\" Arsenal confirmed Kenyon's inquiry and said that he was told Vieira was not for sale. Tottenham have still not signed Liverpool's wing-back Christian Ziege, who is thought to be seeking a pay-off from Liverpool because he had not asked them for a move. A Spurs spokesman said: \"Christian had his medical on Monday and we see no problems in that direction, but he has not actually put pen to paper yet.\" Aston Villa expect to complete the signing of the Swedish international Olof Mellberg today after agreeing to pay the Spanish club Racing Santander \u00a35m for the defender. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
