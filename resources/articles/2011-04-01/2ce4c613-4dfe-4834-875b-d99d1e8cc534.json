Whyte has been involved in discussions relating to the potential purchase of David Murray's 85% stake in Rangers since last November. As part of that agreement, Rangers' borrowings with the Lloyds Banking Group would be wiped out. However, Johnston and some of his fellow board members want to see meaningful sums bestowed on the Rangers team this summer. In a statement, the chairman made clear for the first time his reservations over the possibility of Whyte doing that. Johnston said: \"For some time the board has had major concerns about its engagement in the [takeover] process. After nearly six months of negotiation, we have only very recently had the opportunity to meet Craig Whyte and his team. \"Moreover, it is only in the last few days that we have started to receive the draft agreements outlining the transaction, although we are still awaiting a detailed working capital statement demonstrating that there is sufficient funding in place to meet the pressing needs of the club. \"Based on the documents we have only been able to review within the last week, we are disappointed that they ultimately did not reflect the investment in the club that we were led to believe for the last few months would be a commitment in the purchase agreement. \"Given the requirement to repay the bank in full under the proposed transaction, there appears to be only a relatively modest amount of money available that would positively impact the club's operations, especially as it relates to an urgent requirement to replenish and upgrade the playing squad.\" Johnston revealed an alternative proposal, which would see a \u00a325m share issue launched by Rangers, has been put forward by one board member. The most likely scenario is that Dave King and Paul Murray are the figures behind that move. Johnston added: \"The board believes that it has a responsibility to examine this proposal whilst continuing its review of the Craig Whyte transaction. After six months of limited engagement in the process, the board believes that is not in the best interests of its stakeholders for it to be pressed into an unrealistic timescale.\" The Whyte camp responded by making apparent their own frustrations. A source close to Whyte said: \"For a start, the deal Craig Whyte is putting forward is worth \u00a352.5m, more than double the amount apparently to be raised by this unnamed Rangers director. \"Further, the Craig Whyte investment in the club would begin on day one of a deal being completed. Most importantly, it would mean that the debt owed to Lloyds would be cleared which has been one of the key demands of the entire deal. \"This means that not only will debt be repaid immediately, but that \u00a310m will go into Rangers' bank account on the first day as working capital. Any contrary suggestion about funding is not only untrue but also defamatory. \"There is no certainty that this new proposal has any likelihood of success whereas the deal being put forward by Craig Whyte is real, it can happen immediately and will help secure the future of Rangers FC at a time when it faces great uncertainty. \"It appears to be only one or two members of the current Rangers board who seem intent on delaying this deal and, if that happens and the deal collapses, that will be very bad news for Rangers and the loyal fans who deserve better.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
