As France prepare to face Nigeria on Monday in Rennes, sponsors and TV commentators have revelled in the increased interest. More than 10 million French TV viewers have tuned in for each of France\u2019s matches. The top TV channel TF1, the main broadcaster of the tournament, had expected up to five million viewers for the first match. It got around double. Significantly, twice as many viewers watched France\u2019s 4-0 win against South Korea in the tournament\u2019s opening match than tuned in for the men\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier against Andorra the night before. According to Mediam\u00e9trie analysts, 54% of French TV viewers of Les Bleues\u2019 fixtures are men under 50. Many of them are praising the \u201csuperior quality\u201d of the game. A large amount of families are watching on TV, as well as going to watch the teams in stadiums, where young boys can be seen in the special kits being sold in support of the women\u2019s team. Players such as the France captain, Amandine Henry, the star striker Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer and the defender Wendie Renard have become household names and the team are regularly on the front pages \u2013 an increased visibility that has led commentators to predict an increased interest from sponsors. The crowds turning up to France\u2019s training sessions have swelled, with children calling out to players by their first names for autographs. The France manager, Corinne Diacre, has also swiftly become a household name for using dead-pan humour in response to being portrayed by media as overly strict and severe. The number of hotel bookings in towns hosting matches is said by tourism groups to be unexpectedly high, although for most matches not involving France the stadiums have been far from full. Bars screening the matches report a good turnout. \u201cThere have been a steady number of people watching it live,\u201d said a staff member at Au Metro, a Paris bar known for screening sport. France\u2019s second match, a 2-1 win against Norway in Nice, played to a packed stadium, despite women\u2019s football in the city previously seeing much smaller audiences in recent months. \u201cYou can feel this surge of momentum behind the sport \u2013 the TV viewing figures are staggering,\u201d said Virginie Bachelier, a sports correspondent for Ouest France, France\u2019s biggest-selling regional paper, which is devoting a large amount of coverage to the event. \u201cSix months ago, if a women\u2019s football match got one million TV viewers, that would be considered good. But now 10 million viewers are tuning in on the basis of the team\u2019s skill and performance. People want to watch them because they are world-class players. And in football, you have to get into people\u2019s living rooms for it to count.\u201d Bachelier said she was hoping for a substantial leap in support for the women\u2019s game in the way that France transformed into a football nation when the men\u2019s team won the World Cup in 1998. She said of the France-Norway match: \u201cI thought the crowd might be largely made up of women or women footballers but not at all; it was people of all ages, lots of families, young boys, pensioners and groups of guys. I met a group of five young men who\u2019d come from Toulon. They said: \u2018We\u2019re here because we\u2019re looking forward to watching a good game.\u2019\u201d The turnout in Rennes on Monday is predicted to be large \u2013 Brittany already has a strong tradition of supporting women\u2019s sport. Although France are considered potential favourites to win the tournament \u2013 the hosts want to build on the men\u2019s team\u2019s win in 2018 to become the first country to hold both World Cups at the same time \u2013 the country is typically wary of building up too much bravado. But many are hoping the growing interest in the women\u2019s game \u2013 with sponsors sensing the potential for higher returns \u2013 could help redress the pay imbalance in the sport. Vikash Dhorasoo, a former France men\u2019s international, has started a petition against \u201csexist and salary discrimination\u201d in football, where the women earn far less than their French male counterparts. The satirical French weekly Charlie Hebdo \u2013 which has long derided all types of football \u2013 ran a cover this week mocking the women\u2019s World Cup by showing a football on a woman\u2019s genitals. It sparked criticism, with the French tennis player Lucas Pouille slamming it as \u201cshameful\u201d on Twitter before deleting his tweet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
