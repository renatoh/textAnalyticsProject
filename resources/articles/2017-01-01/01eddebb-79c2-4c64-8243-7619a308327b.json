In 1995, when the Kelbourne was called the Crosslands, it was taken over by the cast and crew of Trainspotting, and those who were there have never forgotten those two days. \u201cThe then owner of the pub was paid \u00a3700 to let them take over the premises,\u201d said Killen. \u201cThey also gave each of the regulars \u00a320 and free booze for the entirety of the filming session.\u201d The director, Danny Boyle, will probably reflect that it was money well spent. At the end of it he had captured one of the scenes that came to define his film. On the couch that backs on to the wrought-iron balcony, Begbie, played by Robert Carlyle, is regaling his chums, Renton, Spud, Sick Boy and Tommy and their girlfriends, about how he had had cause to batter a customer who was acting hard at a game of pool. He then throws his pint glass over his shoulder, which strikes and injures a girl below. It\u2019s the excuse he\u2019s been waiting for all night for some sweet violence. The bar has become a magnet for visitors from all over the UK and abroad. Last week two young Finnish women arrived. \u201cOne of them stood below the balcony where the scene was shot with her iPad, which had a still photograph of it, while the other stood behind her, thus framing the original scene in a photograph taken at the same place. Just brilliant,\u201d said Killen. The pub is in Glasgow\u2019s west end, in a half-mile enclave featuring several other scenes from the first Trainspotting film. Boyle, marshalling a cast of unknowns, was operating on a tight budget. Filming in Glasgow locations to represent the Edinburgh ones described in Irvine Welsh\u2019s book was the cheaper option. Apart from a couple of brief scenes filmed in London and the opening chase scene down Princes Street, Edinburgh, almost all of the 50 locations used were in Glasgow, including many in the derelict cigarette factory just off the M8, which links the two cities. The Crosslands is in Queen Margaret Drive on an invisible boundary where Maryhill, one of Glasgow\u2019s working-class districts, gives way to the more arboreal and salubrious west end. Many of its locations were an authentic representation of the poorer parts of Leith and Muirhouse that framed Welsh\u2019s original masterpiece. A few hundred yards away on Maryhill Road is Cafe D\u2019Jaconelli, where Spud and Renton share a milkshake. This place still retains the charm and authenticity of its 93-year history, replete with its blue fishtank, 1950s juke-box and its classic booths with Formica-topped tables. Its artisan ice-cream is still regarded as the best in Glasgow. A few hundred yards down Maryhill Road is the Firhill Health Complex close to the ground of Partick Thistle FC, where the five-a-side football match takes place early in the film. Sadly, the Volcano nightclub on Benalder Street \u2013 a few blocks away from Maryhill Road \u2013 has been demolished. This was where Renton met Diane, played by Scottish actor Kelly Macdonald, and also where young Glaswegians on a budget strove to get a \u201clumber\u201d (Glaswegian slang for a summary romantic encounter). From there it\u2019s a 15-minute bus journey into the city centre and the George Hotel at the top of Buchanan Street, Glasgow\u2019s shopping paradise. One of the rooms in this grand old hotel \u2013 once the busiest in Glasgow but empty for a few decades \u2013 is the location for the drug deal with the kingpin London dealer, played by Keith Allen. Of all the locations that remain intact from the original Trainspotting, this is probably the one whose surroundings have encountered the most profound societal and cultural change. Opposite the George Hotel is the Buchanan Galleries, one of the biggest shopping emporiums in the UK. A statue of Donald Dewar, Scotland\u2019s founding first minister, sits next to the steps of the concert hall a few yards from the hotel which dominates the top of the street. Until recently, Edinburgh, for all its scenic grandeur and old wealth, did not really have a shopping centre to rival Glasgow\u2019s, and Princes Street, while Renton and Spud were being chased down it, was considered an architectural and shopping wasteland. But a smart new tram system is in place now and the budget shops and fast-food outlets that used to disfigure this old street are gradually being replaced by shops more in keeping with a thoroughfare that also boasts the Scott Monument and looks over to Edinburgh castle. Ironically, the tram system stands as a paradigm for one of the hidden motifs of the original Trainspotting, the sense of alienation of many in working-class Edinburgh from the cultural and opulent glamour of the Old Town and New Town and the money that pours into them during the Edinburgh International Festival and Fringe and the city\u2019s renowned Hogmanay celebrations. The eight-mile tram system was years late and cost more than double its original \u00a3375m budget. If it had existed in the mid-90s it would surely have featured in the original Trainspotting as an emblem of the opulent spending of the city\u2019s political elite in contrast to the poverty in Leith, Muirhouse and Wester Hailes. Perversely, Leith was included in the original tram route and then cast aside as the costs rose. Simon Pia, an Edinburgh academic and journalist, born and raised in Leith, is philosophical about the amount of filming that took place in Glasgow. \u201cLook,\u201d he says. \u201cTrainspotting the novel is the best book that\u2019s ever been written about Edinburgh, but few people in Leith will have minded that much of the film was shot in Glasgow. \u201cMany Leithers,\u201d he says, \u201chave a closer affinity with Glasgow than they do with Edinburgh anyway, and the grit and grime of the book\u2019s locations were authentically portrayed in that great city by the Clyde.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
