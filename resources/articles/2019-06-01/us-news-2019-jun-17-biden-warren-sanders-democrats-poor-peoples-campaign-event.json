Appearing at an event with other Democratic candidates for the first time in the 2020 race, Biden spoke at a forum in Washington organised by the Poor People\u2019s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival. The Rev William Barber, the co-chair of the campaign, urged the audience to refrain from cheering or clapping any of the nine candidates but rather focus on listening. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do that, the media will misinterpret it, and our issues won\u2019t get out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe movement is bigger than any one person.\u201d Even so, some of those present could not resist generating some noise for Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, whereas the reaction to Biden was somewhat cooler. Joy Reid, an MSNBC host who moderated the question and answer sessions, asked Biden how he would get his plans through a resistant Congress, noting that, when he was vice-president, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, considered anything that came from the White House \u201cdead on arrival\u201d. Biden fixed his gaze on the sitting Reid, walked closer and leaned towards her as he replied: \u201cJoy, I know you\u2019re one of the ones who thinks it\u2019s naive to think we have to work together. The fact of the matter is, if we can\u2019t get a consensus, nothing happens except the abuse of power by the executive. Zero.\u201d He acknowledged \u201cthere are certain things where it takes a brass knuckle fight\u201d but said a president has to use the power of persuasion. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make it clear to Republicans that you understand on some things there\u2019s a rationale for compromise.\u201d Biden, who made several references to Barack Obama during some meandering answers, added: \u201cYou can shame people to do things the right way.\u201d During the campaign so far, the former vice-president has implied that Trump is an aberration, and that his defeat could herald a return to the kind of bipartisan cooperation he enjoyed in the Senate with the likes of John McCain. Other candidates, however, have suggested that Trump is a symptom of a far deeper malaise. Warren, who is gaining on Biden in opinion polls, told the forum: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, if we\u2019re in the majority and Mitch McConnell wants to block us on the kinds of things our country needs and the kinds of things they elected me and other people to enact, then I\u2019m all for getting rid of the filibuster. \u201cWe cannot let him block things the way he did during the Obama administration. I\u2019ve been there when it was one set of rules when President Obama was president and now it\u2019s a different set of rules now that they\u2019ve got Trump in the White House. We can\u2019t do that as Democrats. We have to be willing to get in this fight.\u201d The Senate filibuster is a gift to obstructionists, enabling a minority of senators to use procedure to prevent a bill from being voted on by the full Senate by extending debate. In an energetic performance, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado also suggested a combative approach. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want any of us to be as malevolent or as cynical as Mitch McConnell, but could we please just be as strategic as he is?\u201d Raising his left hand, Bennet almost shouted: \u201cWe have a climate denier in the White House! The majority of the American people believe that climate change is real, that humans are contributing to it and we should deal with it urgently. But we have a climate denier in there who ran proudly on that and the Senate is full of climate deniers as well.\u201d Rather than trying to persuade them, the senator argued in favour of out-organising them and building a coalition, including farmers, that could overcome McConnell. \u201cI do not believe we can change all this in one election,\u201d he added. \u201cI think this is going to take the rest of my lifetime, election after election after election, starting with the defeat of Donald Trump.\u201d The Poor People\u2019s Campaign released what it called a \u201cMoral Budget\u201d, highlighting that 140 million people in the US are considered poor or low income, laying out a plan for change, and challenging \u201cthe lie of scarcity\u201d. It identifies $350bn in annual military spending cuts that would make the nation and the world more secure, and $886bn in estimated annual revenue from fair taxes on the wealthy, corporations and Wall Street. Barber declared at the event\u2019s opening: \u201cWe are here because in 2016 we went through the most expensive presidential campaign in US history without a single serious discussion or debate about systemic racism or poverty. Twenty-six debates and not one hour.\u201d Barber criticised Democrats in past cycles for focusing on the middle class rather than the poor and embracing neoliberalism and \u201cRepublican-lite\u201d. He argued that although poverty is most concentrated among black people, it is highest in raw numbers among white people. He quizzed candidate after candidate over how they would deal with the \u201cinterlocking injustices\u201d of systemic racism (for example, voter suppression), poverty, ecological devastation, militarism and \u201cdistorted morality\u201d (for example, by the religious right), and whether Democrats should hold a televised debate on the issue. Sanders and Warren, who both answered yes, seemed most at ease in outlining visions to combat multi-pronged injustices simultaneously. Sanders described Republican governors who suppress votes as \u201cpolitical cowards\u201d and earned applause by stating: \u201cIf you are a citizen of America, you have the right to vote even if you are in jail.\u201d Attendees held up signs including \u2018\u201cStarving a child is violence\u201d, \u201cA poverty wage is violence\u201d and \u201cPolluted drinking water is violence\u201d. Bobby Fields, 33, an African American man who earns $9.30 an hour working at McDonald\u2019s in Tampa, Florida, said he has yet not decided which candidate to support. \u201cTrump has never acted in our best interests. He makes things worse. I\u2019m feeling much better about all the Democratic candidates than I am about the president. Patricia Chadwick, 66, who works in communications for an international not-for-profit organisation, voted for Sanders in the 2016 primary but said: \u201cI like him but he\u2019s a little too old. I\u2019m leaning towards Elizabeth Warren. She\u2019s produced ideas and plans and there\u2019s the benefit she\u2019s a woman. I wouldn\u2019t [vote] for someone just because they\u2019re a woman but I would like to see a woman as president.\u201d As for Biden, Chadwick was unimpressed. \u201cI don\u2019t like him. He\u2019s very mainstream corporate. He\u2019s sexist. I didn\u2019t like the thing he did at the hearing with Anita Hill.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
