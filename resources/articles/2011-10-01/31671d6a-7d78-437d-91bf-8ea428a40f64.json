But Hollande, a wisecracking rural MP, now faces a bruising second-round runoff against Martine Aubry, the mayor of Lille and architect of France's 35-hour week, who scored well and vowed to become the first woman president of France. More than 2 million people voted in the historic primary race, for the first time open to anyone on the electoral register. The high turnout was a boost to the Socialist party, which hasn't won a presidential election since Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in 1988 and has staked its survival on beating Sarkozy in the election next April and May. Hollande, 57, a former party leader, took around 39% of the vote. Centre-left politically and described as witty if unexciting, he had convinced voters he had the most presidential standing as an \"ordinary guy\" in contrast to the erratic Sarkozy. Aubry, 61, a stern former labour minister and most recent party leader, had been described as a kind of Angela Merkel of the left. She took around 31% of the vote, closer to Hollande than had been predicted, making the runoff more tense and uncertain than expected. The biggest breakthrough was the third-place position of the outsider, Arnaud Montebourg, a young MP from Burgundy who had captivated France with his bold proposals to clamp down on banks and fat cats, limit globalisation, restore protectionism and fight corruption. Montebourg, who scored 17%, realised that the French socialists had lost touch with the working class and set out to win them back. A lawyer and brilliant orator, he travelled France in his suits and trademark beige raincoat giving impromptu speeches to crowds on street corners, quoting Bob Marley's Get Up, Stand Up. His ideas range from putting banks under state \"tutelage\" to banning reality TV from France's biggest TV station. Montebourg is now kingmaker and a likely future government minister if the left win. Hollande and Aubry will have to fight for his supporters' votes, which may push the debate further to the left. S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, the former presidential candidate, Hollande's ex-partner and mother of his four children, got a disappointingly low score of around 7%. After the count, Hollande gave one of his trademark presidential-style speeches, betraying how closely he has studied Mitterrand's campaigns. He said he wanted to \"renew\" and reunite the left, reiterating his key themes: helping France's disillusioned youth and creating a fairer tax system. \"I will be the candidate for change,\" he said. Aubry said France needed \"a strong left to fight a hard right\", a jibe at Hollande, who has been attacked over his soft, consensus politics. She said, \"I didn't set out to please or flatter, that's my temperament\", adding that she'd rather tell voters the \"truth\". She promised social justice and education reform. The two will likely face each other in a televised debate before the final vote on 16 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
