The four-year-old, under a fine by Franny Norton, was completing a four-timer. There were plenty with a chance inside the final quarter-mile, but Norton brought Goodbye Mr Bond (5-1) with a perfectly-timed run to get up in the last few strides to beat Countykat by a neck. Tedstale finished well to take third, a further half-length away. Eric Alston, who trains the winner, said: \"We had this race in mind for a little while, and though I didn't really want to run him at Redcar last Friday, I needed to win there to get the 5lb penalty to make sure he got in today's race. \"He would not have got in otherwise. We might give him a break now - his four wins have come in the space of 21 days.\" Loves Travelling's long trip from Newmarket was not wasted with the four-year-old keeping on in great style to defy top weight in the Toteplacepot Cumberland Plate Handicap. Nicky Mackay is certainly value for his 3lb allowance and the young jockey rode a tremendous race on Luca Cumani's gelding. Up with the early pace, Mackay got over to the stand rails in the home straight and then rode out a strong finish to beat Bucks by a head."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
