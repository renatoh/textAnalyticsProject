The forward passed a medical and agreed terms yesterday to finalise his move to Stamford Bridge. The former Werder Bremen striker had fallen down the pecking order under Ottmar Hitzfeld at Bayern, behind Roy Makaay and Lukas Podolski. The imminent arrival of Fiorentina's Luca Toni had been likely to further restrict the Peruvian's opportunities. Pizarro's availability prompted interest from a number of European clubs. The prospect of trophies, though, was a crucial factor in his decision to join Jose Mourinho's side. \"I think it's very important for me to win some titles and I have the chance here to win them,\" he told Chelsea TV. \"The most important thing is the Champions League, which I was looking to win with Bayern but we didn't have the chance. \"I think now we have a good team, a good trainer and the chance to win it. I had some interesting offers but the most important thing was that I talked to the coach, I talked to the people here and they were very interested. We have many chances to win titles here and that's what I want.\" Pizarro becomes Chelsea's second signing of the summer after the 16-year-old Danny Philliskirk's move to Stamford Bridge from Oldham. Despite his limited playing time the 28-year-old managed four goals in last season's Champions League and eight in the Bundesliga. He is expecting to acclimatise quickly to the rigours of the Premiership. \"I very quickly get used to playing with different kinds of players,\" he said. \"I did it at Bayern and I don't think it will be a problem now.\" Meanwhile Chelsea, along with Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham, are monitoring Blackburn's Morten Gamst Pedersen, according his agent, Rune Hauge. \"All the big five follow Morten's situation. We are in contact with the clubs. Morten plays in a special position on the left and can play as well both in 4-3-3 and 4-4-2,\" Hauge told the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet. \"The big ones might not have space for players of his type and we might see players in that position leave some of the clubs in the coming weeks.\" Chelsea's interest in Pedersen may be fuelled by the uncertainty over the future of Arjen Robben, who has yet to sign a contract extension and has been linked with a move to Bayern Munich. However, Chelsea appear to have missed out on Barcelona's Iago Falque after he elected to remain in Catalonia. Frank Arnesen had earmarked the 17-year-old for a move to the Blues but he has opted to stay with Bar\u00e7a."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
