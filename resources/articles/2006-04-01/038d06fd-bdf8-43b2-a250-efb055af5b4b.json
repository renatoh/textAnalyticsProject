Yesterday was meant to provide the Chinese leader with a day of pomp and ceremony: a 21-gun salute and an honour guard at the White House, obscuring the fact that this was not a full state visit. Instead Mr Hu was embarrassed by noisy protests on the streets of Washington, and a protester who managed to disrupt the high pageantry unrolling on the South Lawn of the White House. Moments into Mr Hu's speech, a woman in a charcoal suit perched on the top tier of the stands reserved for the press began screaming in English and Chinese: \"President Bush stop him. Stop this visit. Stop the killing and torture.\" She also managed to unfurl a banner in the yellow and red colours of the Falun Gong spiritual movement before being bundled away by White House security. Her outburst - directly opposite Mr Hu's podium - was captured by CNN and other networks. The Associated Press later identified the protester as Dr Wang Wenyi and said the pathologist had obtained a press pass on behalf of the Epoch Times, a Falun Gong newspaper. The heckler, and the hundreds of protesters around the perimeters of the White House, underscored the difficulties behind the Bush administration's drive to improve economic ties with China. Mr Hu began his visit in Washington state, where he was feted at the home of the Microsoft mogul, Bill Gates, and toured a Boeing plant. He is to visit Yale University today. In public, Mr Bush gave only glancing mention to human rights, noting in his speech on the South Lawn that \"China can grow even more successful by allowing the Chinese people the freedom to assemble, to speak freely and to worship.\" It was unclear whether Mr Bush gave fuller voice to such concerns during his meeting. The White House has been under pressure from Republicans in Congress to pressure China over its forced family planning, and its suppression of dissidents. There is also anger at the growing trade gap, and calls for punitive tariffs. But on the main business of the visit - America's desire to gain greater access to Chinese markets - both acknowledged there had been no breakthroughs. \"We don't agree on everything but we are able to discuss our disagreements in friendship and cooperation,\" Mr Bush said. On trade issues there was little sign of movement on the major irritant in relations: the undervaluation of the Chinese currency that has helped fuel a $202bn (\u00a3113bn) trade imbalance. \"There has been some appreciation in the currency. We would hope there would be more appreciation in the currency,\" Mr Bush said. But he added: \"He recognises that a trade deficit with the United States is substantial, and it is unsustainable.\" On Iran, Mr Bush noted that Beijing shared US concern about Tehran's nuclear ambitions, but indicated there was little headway in persuading China to back security council sanctions against Iran for its efforts to enrich uranium. On North Korea, Mr Hu said: \"The six-party talks have run into some difficulties at the moment.\" But he gave no indication Beijing would try to push Pyongyang to disarm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
