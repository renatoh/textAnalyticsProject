I believe in active citizens.\" Out of context, you might have assumed that by \"active citizen\", Cameron meant someone who voted or scolded teenagers for swearing on the bus. Instead, he seems to be referring to the sharp-elbowed, queue-jumping hypocrites among us. In this sense the term is nothing if not inclusive. The term has a particular resonance with regard to schools, not just because Cameron is himself trying to get his kid into a C of E primary, but because school admissions are the coal face of active citizenry. A 2006 poll suggested that 44% of parents would use underhand tactics to secure a place at a good school. To be clear, we're talking about bending rules designed to ration access where places are limited. Failing C of E schools have trouble filling places, even with heathens, but any oversubscribed school has to employ some method of selection, be it catchment area, church attendance, or lottery, and each method will be, by someone's definition, unfair. Faith schools cannot reliably determine which parents are the most God-fearing; they have to settle for the most resolutely churchy. Thus is born a loophole into which the active citizen may thrust an elbow. The church-going is unlikely to be doing the active citizens any harm; the question is whether their Cameron-sanctioned hypocrisy is doing anybody any good. One might contend that it promotes fairness by showing which loopholes need tightening. It's the same technicality used by lawyers to help celebrities beat charges of driving under the influence. Active citizenship at work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
