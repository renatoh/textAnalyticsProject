Caretaker Peter Wild has a full strength squad to choose from as the Latics attempt to reach the fourth round for the first time since the 2012-13 season, while his Italian counterpart is expected to ring the changes. Ed Aarons Manchester City v Rotherham Sunday 2pm Venue Etihad Stadium Referee David Coote Odds H1-14 A50-1 D13-1 Kevin De Bruyne should start after being an unused sub for Thursday\u2019s 2-1 league win over Liverpool. Pep Guardiola would dearly like to add the FA Cup to complete his set of domestic trophies at Manchester City. Rotherham will arrive fourth-bottom in the Championship so if they can somehow pull off a win this would be a serious act of giant-killing. Fabian Delph serves the final game of his suspension. Jamie Jackson Millwall v Hull City Sunday 2pm Venue The Den Referee Andy Woolmer Odds H11-10 A12-5 D5-2 Millwall, the 2004 FA Cup finalists, came from behind to win at Ipswich last time out. It make it nine Championship points from nine over the festive period after a dreadful season to that point, although they did take a point from the visit of Hull last month. The 2014 finalists have won their last five after a similarly bad start and are 13th, six ahead of the Lions, and may feel they can be a little bolder with selection. Mark Tallentire Newport County v Leicester City Sunday 4.30pm BBC One Venue Rodney Parade Referee Chris Kavanagh Odds H10-1 A2-7 D5-1 The fact Newport beat Leeds at this stage of the FA Cup last season and came within eight minutes of knocking out Tottenham in the following round should serve as a warning to Claude Puel and his players as they prepare for a trip to Rodney Parade. Leicester\u2019s manager is expected to bring back Wes Morgan and make a few other changes after a hectic but successful festive period. Stuart James Preston v Doncaster Sunday 2pm Venue Deepdale Referee Andy Davies Odds H5-6 A7-2 D11-4 Injury-ravaged North End may have Sean Maguire, Josh Earl, Alan Browne and Brandon Barker back involved but Ben Pearson remains suspended. The home side\u2019s three January signings are all cup-tied but Doncaster recruit Kieran Sadlier is expected to get international clearance. Preston were unlucky not to convert numerous chances in their past two games and Doncaster have been scoring for fun so expect plenty of goals. Tony Paley QPR v Leeds Sunday 2pm Venue Loftus Road Referee Geoff Eltringham Odds H9-5 A8-5 D12-5 Leeds arrive at Loftus Road on a run of two successive defeats but are still top of the table while QPR are undefeated in five, their last setback being 2-1 at Elland Road. Marco Bielsa is hinting at making changes as Leeds are back in league action against Derby five days later and enjoying their best chance of promotion in recent seasons. Fans will remember last year\u2019s third-round defeat at Newport but care little if they win on Friday. Mark Tallentire Sheffield United v Barnet Sunday 2pm Venue Bramall Lane Referee Tony Harrington Odds H2-7 A12-1 D5-1 Flying high in the Championship, Sheffield United host non-league Barnet looking for a fourth successive win. Chris Wilder will likely hand the Everton loanee Kieran Dowell his debut, while his captain, Billy Sharp, may be rested having created history last weekend by becoming the leading scorer in the Football League since the turn of the century after taking his tally to 220 since making his debut in 2004. Ben Fisher Woking v Watford Sunday 2pm BT Sport 2 Venue Kingfield Stadium Referee Graham Scott Odds H16-1 A1-5 D11-2 Relegated from the National League last season, Woking released their entire first-team when they went from being full to part-time. Under Alan Dowson \u2013 with Martin Tyler, the commentator, his first-team coach \u2013 the club have rebuilt and are second in the National League South. Only once have Woking reached the FA Cup fourth round. Their chances of an upset? \u201cYou can\u2019t make a shock,\u201d Dowson said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d David Hytner Wolves v Liverpool Monday 7.45pm BBC One Venue Molineux Referee Paul Tierney Odds H3-1 A5-6 D9-4 J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side ran out 2-0 winners at the Molineux just over a fortnight ago but may be unrecognisable, at least in terms of personnel, when they return on Monday. The pursuit of a first league title in 29 years is an all-consuming priority for Liverpool at present and that may be reflected in changes for the cup tie, with Naby Ke\u00efta, Daniel Sturridge, Alberto Moreno and several youngsters likely to be involved.
