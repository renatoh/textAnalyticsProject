I like Chris Evans, who is a mate of mine and I wake up to, and Steve Wright. Otherwise I've found if you listen to them [football phone-ins and discussions] it is a distraction.\" Bruce believes the flak attracted by a series of similarly beleaguered Sunderland managers is amplified by the north-east's relative isolation from the rest of England. \"This is a great club with great support but, let's be fair, there's not much else to shout about apart from our football teams up here,\" he said. That is a contentious assertion but Bruce was on slightly firmer ground when he cited the region's geographical position as part of the problem. \"We are out on a limb, away from everybody, so when it goes well we are the greatest place on earth but, if not, it is batten down the hatches time,\" he said. \"Being born and bred up here I knew what the north-east is about, I knew when I was coming back it was one hell of a challenge.\" Sunderland fans have hijacked radio phone-ins and internet forums to debate replacing Bruce. His former Manchester United team-mate Mark Hughes has emerged as many supporters' favourite alternative \u2013 although Slaven Bilic and even Steve McClaren have their advocates \u2013 but the thinking is rather more long term and considerably less knee-jerk in the Stadium of Light boardroom. Even so, Bruce remains uncomfortably aware that this season is not working out quite the way Ellis Short, Sunderland's owner, and Niall Quinn, the club's chairman, had intended. \"You hope you are given time,\" he said. \"That the people you work for are sensible enough to say 'Let's give him time'. We have had an awful run, we've gone 12 league games without a win and, the way football is now, it's my turn to come under a bit of pressure. But I'm convinced we can turn it round.\" It all seemed so different back on 21 November 2009 when Sunderland last won a league game \u2013 coincidentally 1-0 at home to Arsenal. Since then Bruce's squad has not only been ravaged by injuries but some of the players the former Wigan manager inherited last summer have begun, with certain justification, to suspect he does not rate them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
