He achieved relative fame (as a soloist, in a duo with John Renbourn and with Pentangle) by bringing a jazzy sensibility to finger-picked guitar music, leaving a profound influence on folk-rock and rock for the years to come. More than three decades later, the strings of Jansch's acoustic thunder just as convincingly over the PA of the Jazz Cafe. It's not jazz, by a long chalk, and it's not straight traditional, though some of his best numbers are Irish songs such as Black Water. The man is a legend, and a small, devout group of followers listened attentively throughout the long evening's two sets. After half a dozen solo numbers, including Jackson C Frank's Carnival and a sprightly instrumental, he welcomed guitarist Johnny Hodge to the stage. Hodge, in spangled waistcoat and gaucho hat, employed a decorative style that floated over Jansch's guttural voice and guitar. Another guest was Loren Auerbach, Jansch's wife, who sang Black is the Colour of My True Love's Hair while her old man (not a grey hair in sight) looked on shyly. Jansch played a few more solo numbers before being joined by Bernard Butler on electric guitar. The ex-Suede man was a little uncomfortable with his hero's disdain for set lists - Jansch apparently decided upon each song a moment before retuning his guitar to play it. Yet the combination of Butler's supple tremolo chords and Jansch's gritty acoustic was compelling. It was a shame there wasn't more of this dynamic duo, Butler playing Robin to Jansch's gruff Batman.
