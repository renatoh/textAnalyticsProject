The Australian government denies a quid pro quo, but the release of Jolie King and Mark Firkin from Evin prison came as an Iranian doctoral student, held in a Brisbane jail and wanted for extradition by the US on sanctions-busting allegations, was freed to go home. British-Australian King and Australian citizen Firkin were arrested in early July, reportedly for flying a drone \u2013 to shoot video for their travel blog \u2013 near military installations in Jajrood in Tehran province. They had left their home in Perth, Western Australia, in 2017, documenting their travels on a blog called The Way Overland. Dozens of videos and photographs posted on YouTube and Instagram appear to have been shot using a drone. Drone use with a permit is allowed in Iran but there are strict conditions. People must not fly drones over people or large crowds, over the city of Tehran, or over sensitive areas. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said \u201cvery sensitive\u201d government negotiations had secured the couple\u2019s release. \u201cThe ordeal they have been through is now over, they are being reunited with their loved ones.\u201d Payne said King and Firkin were in good health and good spirits, and had requested privacy. University of Queensland doctoral research student, Reza Dehbashi Kivi, who has been held in a Brisbane jail on sanctions-busting allegations for 13 months, will not be extradited to the US, the Australian government has confirmed. The 38-year-old was arrested in September last year and accused of conspiring to export restricted American-made amplifiers that could be used to detect stealth planes or missiles to Iran. The US sought to have him extradited on six charges, including conspiring to export special amplifiers classified on the US munitions list as \u201cdefence articles\u201d, and of \u201caiding and abetting in the exportation of defence articles from the United States to Iran\u201d. Dehbashi Kivi faced up to 20 years in prison. During a failed application for bail, he told the Brisbane magistrates court he was a PhD student researching the development of a machine to detect skin cancers. Iranian state media agency Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (Irib) has reported Dehbashi Kivi returned to Tehran on Saturday. The attorney general, Christian Porter, would not comment on whether King and Firkin were released in exchange for Dehbashi Kivi but said in a statement that \u201cin all the circumstances of this particular case\u201d Dehbashi Kivi should not be extradited. \u201cMy decision was made in accordance with the requirements of Australian domestic legal processes and is completely consistent with the powers provided to the commonwealth attorney-general under our law,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThe Australian government does not comment on the details behind its consideration of particular cases,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while it is likely that because of Mr Dehbashi Kivi\u2019s nationality some will speculate regarding this matter, consistent with prior practice I do not intend to comment further on the particular details of this case, particularly when any such response from me may diminish our government\u2019s capacity to deal with future matters of this type in Australia\u2019s best interests.\u201d One Australian remains in prison in Tehran. British-Australian academic Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert was arrested last year on allegations of spying. Cambridge-educated Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer in Islamic studies at the University of Melbourne\u2019s Asia Institute, has reportedly been tried and convicted of espionage and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. She is currently being held in Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin prison, and has endured significant periods of solitary confinement. She has had limited consular access from Australian officials and no contact with her family or friends. Moore-Gilbert\u2019s research has drawn her into areas that could be perceived as sensitive, particularly by an Iranian regime under acute pressure from economic sanctions and deeply suspicious of foreign academics and journalists. She has written extensively about revolutions and activism in the Middle East, with a particular focus on Shia Islam, Bahraini politics and its protest movements. At the time she was arrested she held a grant examining \u201cIran\u2019s relationship with Bahrain\u2019s Shia after the Arab uprisings\u201d. The grant was part of the University of Melbourne\u2019s early career researcher grants scheme. Payne said \u201cvery long-term negotiations\u201d were taking place to secure the release of Moore-Gilbert, but the minister conceded her situation was \u201cvery complex\u201d. \u201cShe has been detained for some considerable time, and has faced the Iranian legal system and has been convicted and sentenced \u2026 we are continuing our discussions with the Iranian government and we do not accept the charges upon which she was convicted and we would seek to have her returned to Australia.\u201d Relations between Iran and Australia are robust. Australia has maintained diplomatic relations with Tehran through recent decades where other western nations have abandoned them, or they have become acutely strained. But in August, the Australian prime minister committed to a US-led mission to patrol the Strait of Hormuz off Iran\u2019s south coast through which about a fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said \u201cdestabilising behaviour\u201d \u2013 a thinly veiled reference to Iran\u2019s capture of foreign-flagged ships \u2013 was a threat to Australian interests."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
