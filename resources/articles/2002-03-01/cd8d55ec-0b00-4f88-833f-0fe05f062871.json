He's not with us any more, David Nicholson's packed up, Tim Forster's not with us any more, Fred Winter is with us but...\" Gifford, though, remains firmly in the here and now. He will be 61 in August, but still rides work every morning, and still looks the part too. There is no hint of the usual ex-jockey's paunch on the stocky frame that once carried him to four championships over jumps, not to mention a Chester Cup, Irish Lincoln and 58 other races on the Flat. Next week he will go to Cheltenham with the hurdler Rouble hoping to saddle his 11th winner at the Festival, something that only two other current trainers have managed to do, while 20 years ago he played a leading role in the story of Aldaniti, which was so good someone turned it into a film. Gifford may have been at it for 50 years, but still you wonder how he has crammed it all in. Racing is all he has known since he signed on as an apprentice Flat jockey a week before his 11th birthday in 1952. When he first rode in public, he weighed 4 stone, and it was only a few years later that he joined Captain Ryan Price's Findon stable as a stable-lad and third-string jockey behind Winter and Kelleway. He never left. \"What are you going to do when you pack in riding?\" Price, who was never famous for his subtlety, asked him one day in the late 60s. \"You ought to starting thinking about it, you're not riding very well.\" The Captain offered to sell him the yard for \u00a39,000 plus \u00a316,000 more over four years. They shook hands, and that was that. \"How lucky could I be?\" Gifford says. \"Within 12 months there'd been a boom and it was worth five times as much, and I've never been one to get myself into debt. You get lucky people just as you get lucky horses, and you need something to shine on you at times.\" Gifford was up and running as a trainer, in a yard dripping with racing history, and within a few years, horses like the hurdler Kybo and, in 1981, Aldaniti in the National, had pushed him to the front rank. But his luck never seemed to stretch to the Festival, a meeting which was never generous to him when he was in the saddle either. For all that he was champion four times, Gifford never so much as had a ride in the Gold Cup, while the closest he got in the Champion Hurdle was a short-head second to Persian War. For much of the 1980s, one of the leading questions before every Festival was whether Gifford would finally break his duck - 17 years into his training career, he did, when Golden Minstrel won the Kim Muir in 1988. Half an hour later, Vodkatini and Clay Hill, his runners in the Grand Annual, came home first and second, and there have been eight more since, though none since Brief Gale took the Royal &amp; SunAlliance Chase in 1995. Gifford has an each-way chance in that race again with Silver Streak, but it is Rouble, who runs in the Royal &amp; SunAlliance Novice Hurdle a week tomorrow, that everyone in Findon fancies like mad. The winner of his last three races, Rouble beat the Stayers' Hurdle contender Jair Du Cochet at level weights last time, and Gifford has hinted that he could be a match for anything he has trained. \"Aldaniti was third in a Gold Cup, but this horse would still have a bit more class,\" he says. \"I didn't think he was 100% the other day, but he had to have a run before Cheltenham. It might be that the others ran below par, but if they didn't it was a wonderful performance.\" Victory next Wednesday would do more than offer Gifford another, possibly final, moment in racing's top enclosure. It might also help to secure the succession at Downs Stables, where his son Nick is expected to take over within a season or two. If Rouble wins, there will be a \"they can still train at Findon\" sort of attitude,\" Gifford says. \"You need a star to attract owners, and we're down to 35 horses from about 100 at one time. \"As soon as Nick wants to take over, I shall be happy to hand over to him. It won't be a wrench, he can have it with pleasure, and I will genuinely enjoy being told what to do.\" Gifford's one regret is that he never matched Winter's achievement of being champion both as a jockey and trainer. He looked to have the title in the bag in 1988, until Desert Orchid, \"a horse no-one thought would stay three and a half miles with 12st 7lb\", did just that in the Whitbread. But he is still around, still in there fighting, one of the last of the generation who rode and trained in the 60s and 70s. \"I've been lucky all the way,\" he says. \"Lots of people finish up with nothing, but it's still a great way of life.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
