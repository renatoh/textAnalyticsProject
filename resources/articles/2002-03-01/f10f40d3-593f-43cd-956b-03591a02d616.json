Can't live with them; don't get born without them. Teenage Gabriel is a saddled with a particularly dysfunctional pair - drug-addled casualties of the 1970s rock scene who radiate hopelessness like bad charisma. Hapless Dad even played with the great Lester Jones (a thin fictionalisation of Bowie) until a fall from his platform soles curtailed his career. Kureishi's latest sees him still trying to claw back his Buddha of Suburbia form and almost getting there. Recommended for the exceptional portrait of pallid flop-star Rex, a sad old git who stoically maintains that \"pop nowadays is panto for young people and paedophiles\". He has a point there, surely? In the Blue House Meaghan Delahunt (Bloomsbury, \u00a36.99) The fact that first-time author Meaghan Delahunt used to sell socialist newspapers outside a car plant at five in the morning may counsel you to proceed with caution, though this turns out to be an ambitious, if irritatingly bitty, tale of revolutionary folk in which Trotsky sits out his remaining time in Mexico waiting for the ice-pick to fall. To spice things up, Delahunt invents a sexual entanglement between Trotsky and his hostess, the painter Frida Kahlo, consummating two of the great cult figures of socialism and feminism at a stroke. Unhesitatingly recommended to left-leaning feminists everywhere. Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress Dai Sijie (Vintage, \u00a36.99) As victims of Chairman Mao's \"re-education\" programme, two 17-year-old sons of doctors are packed off to shovel shit in an obscure mountain village, where the local concept of medical treatment is to send for the sorceress. Life is made just about bearable when the pair stumble across an illicit cache of classic western literature, and discover that in certain circumstances, Balzac really can save your life. Dai Sijie is a French-based Chinese filmmaker who was himself re-educated in the early 1970s. His exquisite, life-affirming debut is an essential codicil to Jung Chang's Wild Swans and a re-education for us all. A Son of War Melvyn Bragg (Sceptre, \u00a36.99) Melvyn Bragg's previous book, The Soldiers's Return , ended with his hero failing to make the boat for a new life in Australia. The follow-up finds him knuckling down to make the best of the old one in Cumbria, though the parochial pieties of post-war Wigton are an adrenalin-free alternative to avenging Japanese atrocities in Burma. The intellectual growing pains of Joe, a sensitive adumbration of a certain lavishly coiffured Life Peer, adds a bookish, Laurentian counterpoint, but Bragg treads both familiar ground and an awful lot of water. He could go on writing this novel for the rest of his life, and probably will."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
