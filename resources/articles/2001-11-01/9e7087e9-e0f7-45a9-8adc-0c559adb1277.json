He and Martin Keown looked a real old-fashioned Highbury central defensive pairing. Far less Arsenal-like was the way Tottenham were allowed so many crosses from good positions unpressured, and that led to the equaliser. But overall the game suited Campbell, not least because Spurs did so much attacking. With Ashley Cole rarely able to get forward, Campbell didn't have to make many extended runs into the corners to cover behind the full-back. He could spend almost all the match in a narrow, central zone close to Keown. Had Cole bombed forward more and possession been lost, Campbell's job would have been harder. His responsibilities would have stretched to the touchline if Spurs had gone wide on the counter while Cole was caught upfield. As it was Campbell and Keown could mainly concentrate on making sure they didn't slip up or miss a header. And Spurs' pressure helped in another way: I think defenders are most vulnerable when their team are attacking because they have a tendency to switch off. The way Campbell and Keown stuck close together was the sign of a good partnership, and they were aided by the fact that it wasn't a thoughtful match. The ball was being thrown at them and they didn't have time to think - they just had to deal with it. Keown thrives on the ugly stuff - the blocks, the last-ditch tackles and so on - and Campbell was with him. The bonus to defending is coming out looking like Beckenbauer. The big side is making sure the opposition don't score. In that respect Arsenal were let down by the failure of the front players to work hard enough and the full-backs to get wide fast enough to close down crosses. Spurs' wing-backs, Christian Ziege and Mauricio Taricco, could get forward easily to deliver a stream of crosses. Dennis Bergkamp, Sylvain Wiltord and the substitute Nwankwo Kanu should have been quicker on to the Spurs defenders to deny them time to set up attacks and ought to have closed down Darren Anderton, the deepest Spurs midfielder, when he had possession. With Ray Parlour dragged in a lot because Spurs' 3-5-2 gave them an extra man in midfield, and Robert Pires not tracking back on Ziege, Taricco and Ziege were in acres of space to receive passes. When Anderton had the ball Gus Poyet often made a diagonal run so Arsenal's full-backs felt obliged to tuck in and help the centre-halves. Lee Dixon and Nigel Winterburn would have made it their first job to close down the wide players but Cole and Lauren stayed narrow. They weren't helped by those ahead, and Arsenal can't afford so many passengers among their front players at La Coruna on Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
