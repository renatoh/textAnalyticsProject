It was different when I played: you were only too aware of the past.\" Wales won three grand slams in the 1970s but all they have achieved since that decade is a triple crown in 1988, when they missed out on a clean sweep in their final game against France in Cardiff, and the championship title in 1994, when they lost their last match against England at Twickenham. \"We want to create our own history,\" said the Wales wing Rhys Williams. \"We are aware that we have not achieved the grand slam for years and that we have a chance to make the nation proud once again. \"The emphasis this week is on being relaxed because our style of rugby is based on enjoyment. We have not been in this position as a group of players before, but having been through a bog for the last couple of years and emerged on the other side we are not going to let nerves get the better of us. We want to make sure this success lasts.\" Williams will have a fitness test today on the calf he injured during Sunday's victory against Scotland in Murrayfield, and the hooker Mefin Davies is expected to have recovered from a dead leg. \"I am confident I will play,\" said Williams. \"I came off as a precaution and Saturday is a game no one wants to miss. There is a huge wave of expectation in the country and I know exactly how supporters are feeling because I used to stand on the East Terrace at the old Arms Park as a boy. \"I went with my friends and it was a day out to always look forward to. We would get a bus to Cardiff, go to a burger bar for lunch, something I would dare not do now, get into the ground, stand on the terrace, get soaking wet, join in the singing and start some songs, before grabbing a hot chocolate at the end and returning home for a hot shower. \"I saw 16 of my friends at Murrayfield on Sunday, sitting in the stand wearing Scott Johnson [the assistant Wales coach] masks and waving wooden spoons with the English rose painted on them. Wales is a rugby nation and beating the Irish would mean so much.\" Williams made his debut against Ireland at Lansdowne Road in 2000, the last time Wales won the fixture, and only he, the outside-half Stephen Jones and the wing Shane Williams survive from that side, whereas the team announced by Ireland yesterday contained nine players who played that day. \"Ireland have a settled side and they have been challenging at the top for a few years,\" said Williams, 25. \"Despite losing to France last weekend they will come to Cardiff with confidence and they are used to playing in pressure matches, but if we get our performance right the result will take care of itself.\" The Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan said he was not tempted to make changes despite the reverse against France. The centre Gordon D'Arcy and the wing Shane Horgan were not considered because of injury, and it is 22 years since the Irish lost in Cardiff. \"There was no need to drop anyone from the team: they all played well against France,\" said O'Sullivan. \"The players were very down on Sunday morning, but training has gone well this week. The challenge for any competitive athlete is how you deal with failure. \"England lost four grand slams in a row but they continued to get better and eventually won the World Cup. You can go backwards or forwards in this situation; you can't stand still. This Ireland squad is in the business of getting better.\" Grand slam fever has hit Wales, with supporters yesterday warned to watch out for forged tickets as prices on the black market reached \u00a32,000 for a seat. Like their senior colleagues, Wales Under-21 are on target for a grand slam this weekend. If they beat Ireland at The Gnoll in Neath on Friday night it will be their third clean sweep in six years. They have made one change from their victory in Aberdeen last Friday, with the Llanelli centre Gavin Evans ruled out by a shoulder problem and replaced by Cardiff's Dafydd Hewitt, making his first start in this year's tournament. Wales Under-21: Williams (Newport); Brew (Ospreys), Bishop (Ospreys), Hewitt (Cardiff), Czekaj (Cardiff); M Jones (Ospreys), Ireland (Newport); Roberts (Bridgend), Goodfield (Pontypridd), Griffiths (Neath), Wyn Jones (Swansea), I Evans (Neath), Davies (Bridgend), Mills (Scarlets), Merriman (Hartpury Coll/Gloucester, capt). Replacements: James (UWIC), Osbourne (Cardiff), Thomson (Newport), Smith (Neath), Thomas (Carmarthen Quins), Riley (Pontypridd), W Evans (Carmarthen Quins)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
