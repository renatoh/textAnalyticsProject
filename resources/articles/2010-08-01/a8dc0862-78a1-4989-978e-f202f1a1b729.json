Most bewail the loss of Saxon and other traditional regional denotations in favour of, as one of them put it, mathematics. Would they feel the same if, instead of a pin number, they had to enter their full address at the ATM? Of course not; it's a matter of practical convenience, not sentimentality. The postcode enables the Royal Mail to deliver mail more quickly than any Muddlecombe-over-the-Mead, Countyshire \u2013 not least when there may be several Muddlecombe-over-the-Meads, and people are less methodical than is ideal about including regional names. I, too, am proud of coming from Nottingham, er Nottinghamshire, but it's a boring chore to have to add it to the address. And you can add it, anyway, if you choose, as long as you include the postcode to help the posties. Frederick Robinson Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex \u2022 Many of the comments made in the article about Royal Mail removing county names were wide of the mark. The real threat to the names that most of us associate with our local areas comes from the changes to local government boundaries, particularly with recent changes to unitary authorities. The biggest factor in maintaining this part of our heritage is in the hands of local authorities who look after road signs, and tourist boards who define and publicise our regional identities. I suggest that county name campaigners focus their efforts on these two major influencers. Jon Wallis Amersham, Buckinghamshire \u2022 The Royal Mail is not going to \"abolish counties\". You'll still be free to include it in your address, along with all the other redundant guff showing you live in the posh part of town. Royal Mail just won't bother to store it. I'm surprised they still did so, given that a first line and postcode pinpoints any address in the UK. Vyv Hope-Scott Bristol \u2022 Your distinguished correspondents are needlessly concerned. Royal Mail is not threatening the existence of counties, it is proposing a more rational system of addressing mail. One address in my book consists of seven lines \u2013 absurd. Anyone who has to address a number of letters by hand will appreciate this. In any case, thousands of people live in a postal county that is not the location of their dwelling; I lived postally in Grayshott, Hindhead, Surrey \u2013 Grayshott being in Hampshire \u2013 and in Bishops Frome, Worcester \u2013 Bishops Frome being well inside Herefordshire. Government has learned the attachment people have to the old counties and the 1974 shotgun marriage of Hereford and Worcester happily ended in divorce. The old county names in Wales such as Radnorshire are in use once again. There is an Association of British Counties dedicated to promoting awareness of the importance of the historic counties \u2013 www.abcounties.co.uk. Joseph Cocker Leominster, Herefordshire \u2022 Why this sentimental attachment to county names? They are merely arbitrary signifiers of irregular entities, absurdly dividing communities, such as those of Lancashire and Yorkshire, which, in cultural terms, are virtually identical. Their abolition will help to end the fatuous celebration of trivial regional differences. Peter Bendall Cambridge \u2022 There is a reason other than sentiment for the inclusion of county names \u2013 they avoid misunderstanding. I live in Tynemouth, which is in Tyne and Wear. If I omit the county name some people think I live in Devon and can't spell. Jerome Hanratty Tynemouth, Tyne and Wear \u2022 David McKie has missed something: Royal Mail actually wants to eliminate whole countries. I live in west Wales, less than 10 miles from the Irish Sea, yet my postcode is Shrewsbury. Look out Scotland, Northern Ireland, Isle of Man, Channel Islands \u2013 you're next.
