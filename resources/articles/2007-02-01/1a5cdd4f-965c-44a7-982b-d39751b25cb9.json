The inquiry concluded that Scotland Yard had no option but to act on intelligence that a remote-controlled chemical bomb was hidden in one of the raided houses. Mohammed Abdul Kahar, 23 - who was shot in the shoulder when armed police raided his home - said the report, by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, was a \"whitewash\". Both he and his brother, 20-year-old Abul Koyair, were released without charge a week after the June 2005 raid when the intelligence was found to be unsubstantiated. After an inquiry lasting several months, the IPCC found that, given the intelligence police received, they had no choice but to mount the raid on the adjacent properties in Forest Gate. However, the police watchdog said Scotland Yard should publicly apologise to the two families for what was a \"terrifying ordeal\", adding that both had been victims of \"a failure of intelligence\". Tony Blair today said he continued to give the police his \"total and full support\" in anti-terrorism efforts. \"I think the police, in trying to prevent British people being victims of terrorism, do an excellent job, a fantastic job,\" Mr Blair said at a Berlin press conference with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. \"I just hope that everybody understands that, in doing that job, they are faced with very, very difficult choices.\" For the first time in the history of the IPCC, officials were shown a copy of the intelligence received by police. Deborah Glass, the IPCC commissioner, revealed that she was shown it on the basis that she would not reveal its details to anyone. Ms Glass would only confirm that it alleged a \"highly dangerous explosive device\" was believed to be in one of the two houses. She said the police tactics had been \"forceful and aggressive\", but this was \"inevitable given the threat the police genuinely believed they faced\", but added officers \"could and should\" have changed their tactics once the houses and their occupants were under control. Only two of the 11 occupants at the properties were arrested, yet all were taken to a police station, a move described as both \"inappropriate and insensitive\". The IPCC received more than 150 complaints from the two families who lived in the houses. They interviewed three police officers under caution over allegations that three people were struck during the raid. A file was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service but no charges were brought and, although the IPCC found all three residents had been hit by officers, they made no recommendations that anyone should be subjected to a disciplinary hearing. In the case of a neighbour of Mr Kahar and Mr Koyair, who was hit on the head and needed stitches, the IPCC accepted the officer's statement that he hit the man because he believed he was trying to reach for something under the bed. Mr Koyair was hit on the stairs, the report said - but again the IPCC found that, taking into account the circumstances and the perceived threat, a disciplinary tribunal would not find the officer used excessive force. In addition to being shot, Mr Kahar received a cut to the hand, but again no recommendation was made about disciplinary procedures. \"It is quite right that the level of force used will have raised the most serious concern,\" Ms Glass said. \"I know that some people will feel very strongly that individual officers should be disciplined. \"However, after much thought, I have concluded that the level of force has to be judged in the light of the officers' beliefs that they were facing an extreme lethal threat, not just to themselves but to the public and to the occupants of the houses themselves.\" A small number of complaints, relating to the men's treatment in custody, were upheld, and one officer has received a written warning over an allegation of neglect. The report also criticised the detention of Mr Koyair, who was held by police for several days. Ms Glass said that when innocent people were injured or \"publicly branded as terrorists\", the police should make \"an equally high-profile public apology\". Although Scotland Yard has apologised for the distress caused to the community by the raid, Ms Glass said it should make a public apology to the two families concerned. Mr Kahar today described the IPCC's report as a \"whitewash\" which had given a green light to police to conduct anti-terror operations in whatever way they wanted. \"I would have liked to have seen some people getting prosecuted,\" he said. \"A lot of people understand we were innocent families, we were not what they said we were. We have still not had an apology.\" A statement released by the families' solicitors said they had been the victims of entirely false information from an informant. The statement criticised the IPCC for failing to investigate what steps police had taken to assess the quality of this intelligence. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alf Hitchcock, of the Metropolitan police's diversity and citizen focus directorate, said intelligence was taken from a range of sources and was subject to evaluation, assessment and development. \"The police then have to take very difficult operational decisions which, in this case, have been examined by the IPCC and have been found to be necessary and proportionate,\" he said. Asked whether the Met was prepared to apologise, he added: \"We have apologised on three previous occasions, to the community for the disruption we caused and specifically for the injury we caused in relation to this. \"I think we need to move on from apologising over and over again.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
