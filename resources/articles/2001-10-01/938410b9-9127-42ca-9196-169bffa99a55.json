You come across a cruise, perhaps on these pages, you like where it's going and the ship looks like it won't sink. So you book it and potter about the open seas on a deckchair, right? It's not quite that simple if cruise expert Simon Veness is to be believed. This book is an incredibly comprehensive guide to all you ever needed to know about cruising. Each of the cruise lines and their ships is described in enormous detail - Airtours's ships are said to offer reasonable prices for onboard drinks and the Marco Polo,which belongs to Orient Lines, is an old-fashioned ship, as opposed to a 'floating hotel'. There are lots of hints for first-time cruise-goers - from how to tip to not dashing for the first dinner sitting (you can linger longer over the second)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
