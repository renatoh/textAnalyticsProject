Yet that is exactly what the Post Office, rebranded to hoots of derision as Consignia, has done, provoking the wrath of the new consumer watchdog, PostWatch, and the scarcely veiled anger of the new industry regulator, PostComm. But the PO is no ordinary business. For one thing, it has a (now legal) universal service obligation to deliver mail to Britain's 27m addresses at a single price. For another, it is the country's second-biggest employer (the NHS comes first), with more than 200,000 staff. Unlike other public services or utilities such as electricity, gas, telecoms and water, the PO has experienced the advent of competition unaccompanied by privatisation. Consignia plc may have won greater commercial freedom from government but the state remains its single shareholder and the Treasury still exercises tight control over its balance sheet and borrowings. Late trains \"We are changing this business at a speed we have never achieved historically,\" John Roberts, chief executive, says. \"We're not just changing the machines but the working patterns of 160,000 postmen and women and doing that without the cathartic shock of privatisation.\" But the shock of the new culture is barely evident. The quality of service is declining: 89% of first-class letters (40% of the 28m delivered daily) arrive the day after posting, compared with an agreed target of 92%. An embarrassed Mr Roberts, who says 1% of this is due to late trains after the Hatfield crash and an equal amount is down to disputes, has accepted new targets imposed by PostWatch of 92.1% this year and 92.5% next. The PO's industrial relations record is appalling (see below). John Keggie, deputy leader of the Communication Workers Union, wants a change of culture, too, and is working with PostComm's chief executive, Martin Stanley, senior Consignia managers and union activists to achieve it. \"We've got to change and are prepared to change,\" he says. \"But there are sinister forces on the [Consignia] board that are putting out the message that the CWU has lost control and that favour privatisation. That's why we need an independent review of industrial relations.\" This cuts no ice with Peter Carr, PostWatch chairman and former managing director of Debenhams. Denouncing the proposed price rises, he says: \"It makes you wonder if this is a viable business any more. If your product is under attack from alternatives such as e-mail and not growing at the rate you want, the last thing you do is put the price up. Normally, you do the opposite. \"They've got to attack their cost base - staffing levels, the lot.\" He thinks the PO should in the meantime scrap the second delivery, streamline management and, like the privatised utilities, raise morale by increasing pay while sacking some staff and retraining others. Sitting in his fifth-floor suite at Consignia HQ on the edge of the City, Mr Roberts admits the scale of the problems but insists he and his board can overcome them: through growth, greater investment and improved efficiency. Growth is coming through international expansion (in parcels) and domestic deliveries (up 10% in two years). But, from March 26, the PO has lost its monopoly over items costing \u00a31 or more and the European Union plus PostComm will eventually cut that further, from 350 grams to 50 or even 20. The regulator, says Mr Roberts, might also encourage geographical competition, opening up the service to rival operators. PostComm does not expect real competitors to emerge for, say, two years while it gets to grip with the PO's finances and draws up a pricing formula - on the RPI minus X model - to manage them. That gives the PO a grace period to get its house in order. Mr Roberts says price rises are essential to rectify chronic under-investment: an \u00a3800m funding gap, he estimates. Capital spending (on new automated sorting offices and the like) will be \u00a3400m this year and \u00a3360m next but has been \u00a3100m short each year for eight years. The PO, which lost a net \u00a3264m last year, largely through a failed computer system for paying benefits, says it has contributed \u00a31.72bn to Treasury coffers in recent years - money in government stocks on which it can draw down interest at ministers' say-so. 'Switch customers off' Mr Roberts wants government approval to re-engineer the balance sheet to take on some \u00a32bn in debt and then borrow in the market-place at commercial or preferential rates rather than go cap in hand to the Treasury. Through productivity growth of 3% annually, he expects earnings before interest and tax to rise to \u00a3300m a year over the next three years, and to help fund the investment programme. That means cutting working days lost - under 0.1% of the PO's 50m working days a year - to \"zilch\". \"If people get the choice of competition and we are not reliable enough or good enough they will vote with their feet,\" he admits. \"Unjustifiable strikes will quickly switch customers off and lead to a loss of business and jobs.\" That is the prospect motivating board, union and even the regulator to try to act in harmony. PostComm's first licence for the PO was relatively benign: a \"capitulation\" in consumers' eyes. The regulator appears ready to allow, eventually, merely a handful of niche operators to challenge the PO in the hope that Consignia gets into shape and improves the universal service. Otherwise customer loyalty will be so severely stretched that the corporation is broken up or even, like British Gas and BT, given the cathartic shock of privatisation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
