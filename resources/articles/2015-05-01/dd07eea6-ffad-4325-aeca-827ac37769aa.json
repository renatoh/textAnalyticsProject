She was the same age as my daughter and had the same surname. Two country girls. Parallel lives. It hit home. This Miss Hart, as her family would like her to be known, came from an Aboriginal community called Weilmoringle, north-east of Bourke in far western New South Wales. She had a three-year-old child. She had strong family support. She was loved. This Miss Hart died at a house in Brewarrina. This Miss Hart, in the words of one who knew her, was a \u201clovely soul\u201d and a \u201clittle girl trying to survive\u201d. She did not. The investigation is now in the hands of the police and the courts. While there are many accounts in that town, it is not possible to stray into details ahead of the court case. But Miss Hart\u2019s death has made the women of Brewarrina angry. Two women, Trish Frail and Grace Gordon, organised a march against domestic violence and illegal drugs. On an unusually rainy day for \u201cBre\u201d, 80 people attended in support of the aims of the marchers and in honour of Miss Hart. It was a short march to lay a wreath, but the police encouraged them to take a longer route in order to pass the pubs. The turnout surprised them. The victim\u2019s family would like it to be an annual event. It would be easy to go into the little town (population 1,200) and represent it as a basket case. In the media, country towns are often painted as backwaters, filled with rednecks and no-hopers \u2013 centres of boredom, petty vice or thuggery. Instead, more instructive is to honour Miss Hart by drawing attention to a lot of women in her plight. Those mothers and daughters who will miss their hug today because no one spoke up for them. Away from this case, we know, due to the relentless efforts of domestic violence campaigners, that one (or more) women die every week at the hands of a partner or an ex. And in recent years, dovetailing with this unvarnished statistic, is a rise in the use of ice or crystal methamphetamine. This deadly combination is affecting all towns and communities. Black and white. City and country. NSW statistics, recorded by police, tell the story. Common sense would suggest they are the tip of the iceberg as many assaults go unreported. A look at the Brewarrina local government area shows incidents of domestic violence-related assaults rose from 49 in 2011 to 98 in 2014 \u2013 a 14% average annual increase over five years. It may be that more people are reporting. It may be that there are more incidents. We just don\u2019t know. At the same time, incidents of possession and/or use of amphetamines are also increasing. Brewarrina is in the far west and Orana region, where usage has increased on average 23% every year for the past five years. There may be no correlation between the rise of domestic violence and amphetamine use. We don\u2019t know because so far, statistics have not been collected for drug use when recording DV assaults. If you think the statistics in Brewarrina are bad, a look at the 2014 NSW Recorded Crime Statistics report shows many larger upward trends in amphetamine use. Bear in mind again, these figures are only recorded police incidents for possession or using ice. The report warns: \u201cTrends shown may be more indicative of policing operations rather than the incidence of those particular offences.\u201d Across regional NSW in 2014, the two-year trend is an annual increase in possession or use of 41%. The five year annual trend is 27%. The rate of incidents per 100,000 head of population is 98. This compares with greater Sydney, which has a two-year average annual increase in usage of 32% and 24% annually over five years. The city rate is 91 incidents per 100,000 people. In some districts, the rate is far higher. Coffs Harbour showed a staggering 111% average annual increase in ice incidents over the past two years. In the Riverina, where I come from, it\u2019s 85.7%. In the New England and north-west of the state, it is 79%. These may be as a result of police crackdowns, but you get the picture. Grace Gordon, an elder of Ngemba people, helped establish a Ourgunya women\u2019s safe house in Brewarrina between 2002 and 2012. She says in her experience, ice has been contributing to the increased rates of domestic violence. \u201cIce is changing dynamic of all the communities; violence is becoming more severe and more regular,\u201d she says. Before it lost funding under the NSW government in 2012, the Ourgunya safe house was staffed 24 hours a day and she had clients who stayed there for years. In December 2014, a new safe house was built, to be run by Mission Australia. For Gordon, it is not only occupational experience which drives her. It is personal. She suffered domestic violence in a relationship for 10 years. Later, her son started taking ice. When mother and son talked, he offered excuses for hitting his partner. \u201cI used to say to him the person in the relationship with a problem is not the girl. It\u2019s you. I feel strongly in my heart that our women are not punching bags,\u201d she says. \u201cI see the drug ice as a demonic force. I\u2019ve seen people on it. Their eyes are distant, they are not with it. My son took ice and when he was on it he would see people that weren\u2019t there.\u201d Since the drug came to the town, Gordon says many people have been seduced by it, including members of \u201cprominent families\u201d. She says successful rehabilitation and reform are usually a product of strong family support. Her son is working through his rehabilitation. Gordon, who is on the Ngemba community working party, would like to see random drug testing in government offices, schools and police stations. She says locals know who the dealers are in the town, but they never seem to get caught. \u201cBre is a beautiful place. It\u2019s a clean town but we need to bring back a full code of conduct of how people should be acting. People do work together so we can conquer this but the solutions have to come to local community.\u201d When I speak to Trish Frail, of the Brewarrina Integrated Child and Family Centre, she is trying to find the number of the prime minister\u2019s newly announced national ice taskforce which will hold hearings across the country and has to come up with a strategy to fight the drug at the end of the year. Frail is determined to speak out about the dangers to the Indigenous community of drugs and domestic violence. She will make a submission to the taskforce. \u201cThere has become an acceptance of violence and drugs but it is not a part of our culture,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep putting Band-Aids on the problem. We have to start cleaning the wound itself.\u201d This weekend, instead of celebrating Mother\u2019s Day with her son, Miss Hart will be remembered at her funeral. She is the 33rd woman in Australia this year to die a violent death, according to Counting Dead Women project. Although she died just two weeks ago, her death has already been overtaken by number 34, Linda Locke. While Miss Hart\u2019s story captured my attention, the truth is all these dead women and children have parallel lives. Happy Mother\u2019s Day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
