His Werder Bremen counterpart Tim Wiese was the German team's culprit in the tie, and his two monumental mistakes at Ibrox last week proved decisive over the 180 minutes. The visitors to the Weserstadion had to withstand a major onslaught from the hosts who took the lead in the 58th minute thanks to a moment of magic from Diego. Werder hit the crossbar through Boubacar Sanogo five minutes from time, but it was the fingertips of McGregor which prevented the close-range shot finding the net as he touched it against the woodwork. Rangers boss Smith made just one change to the side that triumphed over the Germans at Ibrox, replacing Daniel Cousin, who suffered a fractured jaw in the first leg, with Nacho Novo who was the lone striker in a defensive formation. Jean-Claude Darcheville was also absent due to an Achilles injury, while Bremen started with midfield genius Diego despite his dressing-room bust-up with striker Aaron Hunt in Glasgow. Hunt was one of three strikers in Werder's starting XI and the hosts wasted no time stamping their authority on the battle. Within two minutes, Daniel Jensen pulled the trigger from the right corner of the box and his low shot flew inches past the left post before Markus Rosenberg failed to control a header from Per Mertesacker deep inside the danger area. After Sebastian Boenisch dragged a 20-yard shot wide, Hugo Almeida nodded over after a feed from Hunt. Rangers had difficulty coping with the pressure but Charlie Adam found himself with time and space inside the Werder box on one of the rare attacking forays. Mertesacker twice got his body in front of the ball though as Adam looked to give Rangers the away goals which would have meant the home side needed four goals. Rosenberg then forced McGregor into a strong save with his shot from 16 yards out on the right and unmarked Tim Borowski volleyed over from close range. The hosts kept striding forward with purpose, with McGregor spectacularly stopping a powerful 14-yard strike from Jensen in the 24th minute. The 26-year-old was the hero again when he turned a shot from Patrick Owomoyela wide of the left post. Luck was then on McGregor's side when he underestimated a cross from the left and Almeida headed wide. Novo wasted a golden chance to break the deadlock after Kirk Broadfoot found him with his pass down the right flank. The Spaniard's shot from a sharp angle was punched away by Wiese. There were no changes after the break, and the pattern remained the same, with Rangers on the back foot. Bremen launched one furious assault after another, with McGregor stopping two more fierce shots from Jensen in the 50th and 55th minutes. Rangers brought on Steven Whittaker for Adam to give the visitors added defensive strength, but Diego soon put Bremen ahead. The Brazilian made space for himself with some superb skill on the edge of the box and then beat McGregor with a low left-footed shot across the goalkeeper and into the right corner. Rangers almost levelled immediately but Davis could not finish off good work on the counter-attack from tireless right-back Broadfoot. David Weir and Carlos Cuellar were heading away most of the high balls into the Rangers box, but often only finding Bremen players. Mertesacker threatened with a header from Bremen's 14th corner not long after Lee McCulloch replaced Novo in the 78th minute. Then Whittaker burst into the Bremen box and won a corner, buying Rangers some valuable time before the home defence cleared the danger. The chance to take the game to extra-time fell to substitute Sanogo who from six yards should have buried the ball past McGregor. The goalkeeper looked to have no chance but covered yards of ground to turn the ball onto the bar. Rangers would never allow Bremen to get close again as they survived a dramatic final minute to book their ticket to the quarter-finals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
