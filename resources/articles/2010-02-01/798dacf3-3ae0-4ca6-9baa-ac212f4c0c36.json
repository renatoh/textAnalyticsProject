After winning more gold medals in Vancouver than any other country the hosts ended the 2010 Winter Olympics with the one they wanted most of all, beating the United States 3-2 in the final of the ice hockey tournament. A golden goal by Sidney Crosby, the golden boy of Canadian hockey, seven minutes into overtime secured a famous victory in the sport so entwined with the nation's identity. It was a wonderful strike, a moment for the generations and a fitting end to a very Canadian Olympics. Joy was unconfined and, if the tumult within the Canada Hockey Palace is anything to go by, it is destined to last a very, very long time. The US had outplayed Canada in the round-robin stage, beating them 5-3, so it came as little surprise when the hosts stepped on to the ice yesterday with an entirely different attitude and approach. Instead of being tentative, they were determined. Instead of absorbing pressure, they applied it. Not surprisingly, the results were different too. The opening goal, by Jonathan Toews, came after a long stretch of Canadian pressure, while the second goal, came seven minutes into the second period, did not come as a shock. Yet, as had happened in the semi-final, when they almost ceded a 3-0 advantage to Slovakia, the Canadians confused a comfortable lead with the final result. Complacency is an age old failing, as deadly in ice hockey as it is in any sport, and its effects were felt within five minutes. A mistake by the Canadian goaltender Roberto Luongo, who let the puck slip between his arm and his body, saw the advantaged halved and the balance of the match shift. The goal was given to the US player Ryan Kesler but the responsibility for landing his team-mates, and his nation, with the prospect of a torrid third period belonged to Luongo. Those final 20 minutes were frenetic, but they were also a magnificent illustration of this sport's appeal. Speed, skill, crushing physical challenges \u2013 it had everything except a goal. Alas for Canada, that deficiency ended with 25 seconds of regulation time remaining, when Zach Parise scored for the US. The home celebrations were cut short but only for as long as it took the flashing blade of \"Sid the Kid\" Crosby to make its mark. Canada have won 14 golds at these Games but there was no mistaking that this was the one that really counted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
