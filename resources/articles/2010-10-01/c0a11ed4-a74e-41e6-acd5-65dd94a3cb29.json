Kenny kept out David Cotterill's 39th-minute spot-kick . Jamie Mackie twice went close for QPR after the break, while Kenny was required to make another good save from Darren Pratley's close\u2011range effort. Second-placed Cardiff City closed the gap by beating Coventry City 2-1. Peter Whittingham's early penalty gave the Bluebirds the advantage at the Ricoh Arena, but Gary McSheffrey pulled Coventry level a minute before the interval. Jay Bothroyd grabbed a late winner for Cardiff, which takes them within two points of QPR. Crystal Palace picked up their first away win of the season, 2-1 at third-placed Norwich City. Grant Holt put the home side ahead only for Julian Bennett and the on-loan Anthony Gardner to secure the points in the second half. The on-loan Tottenham full-back Kyle Naughton and the striker Steve Howard earned Sven-Goran Eriksson's Leicester City a 2-1 win at Leeds United, for whom Luciano Becchio was on target. Two goals in three minutes, from Stephen McGinn and Marvin Sordell, just before half-time gave Watford a 2-1 victory over visiting Ipswich Town."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
