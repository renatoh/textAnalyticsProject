The day before launching its annual report, the BBFC met the Critics' Circle to celebrate both bodies' centenary years with a presentation and lunch at the Cinema Museum in south London. Senior examiner, historian and dry wit Craig Lapper took critics through a brief history of the relationship between the two organisations. Over the years, and in just about equal measure, critics have either chided the BBFC for being too liberal or too draconian. The censors' original 43 \"grounds for deletion\" list from 1916 included several amusingly old-fashioned points, including scenes of \"vitriol throwing\", \"scenes laid in disorderly houses\", \"vulgar accessories in the staging\", \"indecorous dancing\" and scenes likely to \"bring into disrepute British prestige in the Empire\". Politics, it was felt, were not fit for the cinema, hence the long banning here of Bolshevik masterpiece Battleship Potemkin, which arrived in 1926, the year of the General Strike. Classic cases re-examined included David Cronenberg's Crash, John McNaughton's Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and Paul Morrissey's Trash. I didn't know that the first approved showing of an erect penis was in Pasolini's Theorem in 1968 (it did not belong to the film's star, Terence Stamp), nor that the first flash of female pubic hair allowed was in Antonioni's Blow-Up (1966). Foreign film-makers could get away with a lot more. Over cake later, I wondered how the Palme d'Or winner Blue Is the Warmest Colour might fare with the board? The BBFC hasn't received a copy of the film for certification yet and it is still unclear if the version shown in Cannes, featuring long and explicit scenes of sex between its two stars, L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, will be the same as that scheduled for UK release by Artificial Eye on 15 November. I had a wager with another critic that the film would get an 18 rating. He's going for 15. We shall see. Softley does it After last week's story about Mike Figgis wanting to shoot in Kate Moss's new house, director Iain Softley tells me he tried to film the French scenes of his latest thriller, Trap for Cinderella, in the house of crooner Sacha Distel. \"It's a beautiful place on the coast but we just couldn't get it to look right for what we needed,\" he told me. \"It was also proving expensive.\" In the end, Softley chose an isolated farmhouse an hour from the coast and used a beach near Marseille for his bathing scenes. The film is based on a book by the late Sebastien Japrisot but who was alive when Softley optioned the 1963 book. Japrisot wrote the screenplay for the original 1965 Piege pour Cendrillon, but told Softely he hadn't seen the movie since. \"I tried to track down a copy but have had no luck,\" Softely tells me. \"I'd love to see it and it was always my intention to do so, so if anyone knows of a copy, do let me know.\" It seems odd to me that two established directors are both struggling to get low-budget movies made in Britain. It's all very well supporting young film-makers, but what about supporting those who, in terms of their craft, are just coming into their prime? No wonder they're both off to LA for their next movies. Bonding the team Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig will be reuniting for the next Bond movie, the director and star of Skyfall confirmed last week. Skyfall made pots of money, of course, which Barbara Broccoli is already pouring back into British film with productions such as The Silent Storm, currently being shot in Scotland with Damian Lewis and Andrea Riseborough. However, she might need to keep a bit back: Bond 24 will prove costlier in terms of talent if agents are doing their jobs. We'll have to assume that Ralph Fiennes will also return for the October 2015 release (as M), and Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw (Moneypenny and Q, respectively) too, all of whom are bigger stars than before. Although his acting skills are undisputed, Fiennes's second film as director, The Invisible Woman, will, I hear, establish him as a film-maker of considerable stature; Harris is already being talked of for Oscar nominations for her part as Winnie Mandela in A Long Walk to Freedom; and Whishaw, I hear, is outstanding in small British film, Lilting. And will Adele do a Shirley Bassey and return for another theme-tune belter?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
