Terry Nation played no part in creating the series, but began writing for it later. An editing error made Minder, Danger UXB and The Naked Civil Servant into BBC, rather than ITV, productions. None were serials: the first two were series, and the last a single drama. In a review of a Barbican concert given by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Valery Gergiev, we said the First Cello Concerto by Boris Petrenko was played. The composer was Boris Tishchenko (Reviews, page 34, November 26). Yesterday's kakuro puzzle was a repeat of the puzzle published the day before (both page 36, G2). We also printed the same sudoku puzzle twice (page 46, November 24, and page 36, G2, November 26). The sudoku that should have appeared on November 24 can be found at theguardian.com/sudoku. In an article headlined Has the death of mainstream TV been exaggerated? (page 3, Media, November 26) we said BBC2's audience share was slightly up on last year. In fact the latest ratings show a decline from 8.8% to 8.5% this year. We mistakenly priced the Biome Lifestyle crackers at \u00a34.50 for six in the Personal shopper column (page 7, Family, November 24). They cost \u00a34.50 each, or \u00a325 for six. \u00b7 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible. Please quote the date and page number.
