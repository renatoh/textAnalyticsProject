While the subsequent two months have provided little cheer, though, yesterday gave something close to the ideal conclusion. As Wigan overcame Portsmouth, and overhauled Stoke to claim 11th place, their goalscorer Hugo Rodallega furthered the impression he is poised to make a considerable impact next term, while Antonio Valencia provided a scintillating valedictory display. \"He showed why we'll struggle to hold on to him [Valencia],\" said Steve Bruce. \"He was magnificent and he deserves to play at the highest level. How the hell do you replace him?\" It was a pertinent question: Jermaine Pennant, a potential successor, suffered in comparison with the electric Ecuadorean. Despite the end-of-season slump Bruce reflected with some satisfaction. \"For a club like ours it's terrific we can finish 11th while some massive clubs were relegated,\" the manager said. Portsmouth were long candidates for demotion themselves. The caretaker manager Paul Hart, whose own future will be resolved at a board meeting this week, downplayed his contribution to preserving their Premier League status. \"If you look at my CV, there are not many achievements,\" he insisted. Self-deprecation may yet earn him the position on a permanent basis. With or without him, a summer of upheaval beckons, but this was a farewell best forgotten for some valiant servants. In particular it may have marked an inglorious ending for Sol Campbell, Portsmouth's most successful captain for half a century. His was an undignified send-off, the defender failing to cut off the cross that led to the goal and slashing wildly like a batsman playing down the wrong line. It meant Rodallega was afforded the luxury of a touch before tapping in Charles N'Zogbia's cross. If a defensive mishap brought the breakthrough, Wigan's invention and energy could have yielded more goals. \"You could see our achilles heel,\" said Bruce. \"We could have won two games.\" Rodallega could have had a hat-trick while Asmir Begovic thwarted Mario Melchiot, who had combined with the Colombian. N'Zogbia and Valencia provided pace on either flank and Wigan benefited from defensive solidity. Besides revelling in Newcastle's misfortunes their supporters offered an appreciation of Titus Bramble's excellence over thepast nine months. The chants of \"Bramble for England\" were only aired mockingly before this season, but he has been awarded the club's player of the year award. His career has been transformed by Bruce, while Valencia has been assisted on his rapid rise. Asked when the Ecuadorean may exit, he referred to Real Madrid's forthcoming choice of president: \"When is the election on?\" Man of the match Antonio Valencia (Wigan) Valencia is likely to be sold to a big club in the summer, and here's why: he doesn't mess about, a proper old-fashioned winger who hugs the touchline, spending most of his day in the opposition half."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
