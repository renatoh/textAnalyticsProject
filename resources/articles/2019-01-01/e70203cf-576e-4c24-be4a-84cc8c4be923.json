Here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s match report from a buzzing Hive: Here\u2019s Dan Sparkes: \u201cI\u2019m known for a set piece but they\u2019re hard to get right. I did what I could.\u201d Nice line in understatement from the matchwinner there. Peep! PEEP!! PEEEEEP!!! All over. What a terrific Cup tie. Pretty much a fair result I\u2019d say. These two will have to do it all over again in a week or two. 90+6 min: Sawyers beautifully picks out the run of Dalsgaard who is in behind the Barnet backline \u2026 but he\u2019s there because he\u2019s offside. And that should be that. 90+5 min: Into the final minutes of minimum added time \u2026 90+4 min: \u2026 poked goalwards by Konsa but the effort drifts wide. 90+3 min: Odubajo forces a corner \u2026 90+2 min: Barnet have settled for the replay here, understandably. Brentford \u2026 not so much. 90 min: Another Barnet sub: Boucaud comes on for Elito. And the fourth official indicates there\u2019ll be a minimum of five minutes added time. 89 min: Handbags! Right in front of the Brentford fans who are massed behind the goal. Maupay, slightly naughtily, shoves Taylor into the hoardings and the midfielder reacts angrily. The referee speaks to both, who are equally culpable. No bookings, no bother. 87 min: For the THIRD time in the game Brentford hit the inside of the post. Obubajo forces his way through and sees his shot come back off the woodwork and ping across goal. 85 min: Benrahma tests Huffer from the edge of the box but the keeper is equal to it. 83 min: Benrahma curls an effort a yard wide from the edge of the box with Huffer at full stretch. 82 min: Brentford look like scoring every time they have the ball at this stage. Dalsgaard, in particular, has made a difference. Can Barnet hold out and/or nick one? 80 min: Another fine chance for Brentford. Canos\u2019s shot hits his own player \u2013 Barbet, who needs treatment afterwards \u2013 full in the face and Konsa batters the rebound off towards Canons Park tube station. 79 min: Cracking save from Huffer as Barnet\u2019s midfield goes AWOL. Maupay\u2019s shot it tipped over the bar. 78 min: Brentford sub: Watkins off, Benrahma on. I doubt the goalscoring has finished here. 76 min: It\u2019s almost 4-3 within seconds! Dalsgaard climbs highest and his header floats a foot wide of the post. This is just superb entertainment. Holy moly! Sparkes lets fly and it\u2019s a quite brilliant strike. What a hit! Off the underside of the bar and in! 74 min: Coulthirst wins a free-kick right on the left corner of the Brentford box \u2026 Ah, the first bit of real quality from Brentford and it puts them 3-2 up. Dalsgaard picks out Canos, who is charging through the middle. He takes a lovely touch to move the ball away from a sliding defender then calmly tucks the ball home. 69 min: Subs: Henry off, Dalsgaard on for Brentford. And Fonguck off, Sparkes on for Barnet. 68 min: Rico Henry\u2019s cross is well cut out by Johnson. I\u2019d be stunned \u2013 stunned, I tell you \u2013 if we don\u2019t get at least one more goal here. 66 min: A terrific move from Barnet \u2013 the increasingly impressive Mason-Clarke finding Alexander, whose cross is nodded straight at Daniels by Coulthirst. 64 min: A final replay from behind the goal suggests that was certainly a dive from Watkins. Barnet need to get the injustice out of their minds, though \u2013 this is still there for the taking. 63 min: \u2026 Daniels claims it but in the process he\u2019s injured two of his defenders. Both very gingerly get to their feet. 62 min: The more replays you see, the more that looks a dive from Watkins. No matter now, we\u2019re back at all square and Barnet have a corner \u2026 Maupay calmly finishes low to bring Brentford level. 59 min: Tutonga trips Watkins amid a huge scramble \u2026 or does he? Replays suggest not but the referee has pointed to the spot \u2026 57 min: Wow. Jeanvier overhits a cross-field ball by about 30 yards. Brentford brains are frazzled. Deep breath required. 55 min: The Hive is bouncing now. A crazy 10 minutes. Brentford\u2019s defending has been dire since the break. 54 min: This is remarkable. Six Brentford defenders fail to deal with a routine cross and after a brief, mad scramble the ball breaks to that man Coulthirst, who slams the ball home. It\u2019s 2-1! Oh my word! The National League side are level! Mason-Clarke finds some space in the right channel, tries a few stepovers then fires the ball in to Coulthirst. And the man who scored the winner at Bramall Lane in the third round pokes home to send the home fans wild. 48 min: \u201cI\u2019m not very footbally but keep an eye on Brentford because my Dad alleged that he was the junior team goalie somewhere in the time of Ron Greenwood and Jimmy Hill,\u201d writes Peter Gibbs. \u201cI realise by telling you this that other MBMers may debunk this claim. Then again, my dad also told me that I was supposed to be made a director of Leyton Wingate but the owner (?) died on the golf course before he made it happen.\u201d 47 min: \u2026 which is cleared. Rather brilliantly there\u2019s a microphone somewhere in the ground that is picking up a Barnet fan or possibly coach who is screaming \u2013 and I mean screaming \u2013 at the home players. 46 min: Watkins forces a corner \u2026 Peep! Off we go again. The players are back out. Second half here we come! An email! Here\u2019s Neal Butler: \u201cYour earlier comment about Europe playing The Final Countdown three times reminded me of this old sketch from Big Train.\u201d Some half-time Big Train for you all. Lovely. Peep! PEEEEEP!! That\u2019s half-time. Barnet aren\u2019t out of this, not by a long chalk. 45 min: There\u2019ll be a minimum of two minutes of added time. Barnet don\u2019t want half-time at the moment, though. They\u2019ve been great since falling behind. 44 min: Mason-Clarke gets in behind on the Barnet right but his cut-back falls between three teammates. That was a chance. 43 min: Coulthirst does brilliantly on the break, flicking a long ball on and then getting on the end of it himself. Barbet does brilliantly to get back and challenge the striker and when the ball breaks to Taylor he thrashes the ball wide. 41 min: Robson pings an effort at goal from distance but it\u2019s high and wide. And the Championship side take the lead. Maupay was guilty of holding on to the ball too long a moment or two ago, but Watkins lets fly from close to 30 yards out and sees his effort zip past Huffer and nestle in the bottom corner. 38 min: Maupay picks Sweeney\u2019s pocket and is through on goal but Barnet scramble back to deny the striker space. 37 min: The first yellow card of the game goes to Odubajo, who is guilty of pulling back an opponent as Barnet break. 35 min: Here\u2019s the full draw for round five: 33 min: There\u2019s a pause for breath as Tutonda gets some treatment for a knock. He\u2019s fine to continue. 30 min: Mason-Clarke gets half a sight of goal as Coulthirst causes havoc in the Brentford defence. His shot is weak, though, and Daniels gathers. 29 min: \u201cLook no further than the 64th Grey Cup, the final game of the Canadian Football League\u2019s 1976 season where the Ottawa Rough Riders faced the Saskatchewan Roughriders,\u201d writes Glenn Shepherd. \u201cOttawa won 23-20!\u201d 28 min: Brilliant block from Alexander as the ball drops to Canos on the edge of the Barnet box. This is a cracking Cup tie. 27 min: That goes down as a great chance for the home side. It was a fine save but Sweeney will think he shouldn\u2019t have given him the chance. 26 min: \u2026 Sweeney meets it with a thumping header that Daniels does superbly to turn away. 25 min: Taylor does superbly to skitter onto Robson\u2019s pass and cut back across goal. Cleared. Corner to Barnet \u2026 22 min: A stunning effort from Odubajo cannons back off the woodwork! The Brentford wing-back cuts inside and spanks a curling effort onto the inside of the same post that Barbet hit earlier. Almost the same spot in fact. Again the ball pings across goal and away to safety. 20 min: Da Silva cuts inside and hammers a shot at goal \u2013 it\u2019s straight down Huffer\u2019s throat and the keeper gathers despite an awkward bounce. 19 min: Johnson clears as Henry fires in another low cross. Barnet desperately need to release the pressure. 17 min: Brentford are just beginning to crank up the pressure. Rico Henry threatens on the left and it takes some scrambling in the Barnet backline to clear. 15 min: Maupay gets his foot on the ball, on the half-turn, inside the Barnet box but Sweeney is across quickly to smother the danger. 14 min: It\u2019s all got a little bit scrappy, which will suit the non-league team just fine. 11min: Canos\u2019s throughball towards Maupay is overhit but a moment or two later Sweeney nips in to cut out a a dangerous header from Watkins. 9 min: \u2026 my word, how did that stay out? Watkins delivers to the near post where Barber flicks on with his head. The effort thuds onto the inside of the near post and bounces away across goal to safety. 8 min: \u2026 Barbet slaps his first effort into the wall, then sees his follow-up deflected away for a Brentford corner \u2026 7 min: Watkins is hauled down on the edge of the Barnet area by Robson. A very dangerous position this \u2026 6 min: \u201cBristol City v Swindon \u2013 The Robins v The Robins,\u201d suggests Don Blandford. Is there a ground called The Nest or similar? 5 min: Barnet have started vert well here. Elito sidefoots in a cross but it\u2019s far too close to Daniels. 4 min: Elito looks to get away down the Barnet left but is outmuscled by Konsa. 2 min: \u2026 a Brentford head meets it and the Championship side look to break but it comes to nothing. 1 min: \u201cMillwall v Guiseley?\u201d suggests Michael Watson. \u201cLions v Lions at the Den.\u201d Yes, absolutely. Meanwhile, Barnet have started on the front foot and have an early corner \u2026 Peep! Off we go then. The players emerge from the tunnel to the guitar intro of Sweet Child Of Mine. The fact that it this is the Bees facing the Bees at the Hive is obviously pleasing \u2013 I\u2019m racking my brain to think of any other nickname v nickname at [insert apt ground] examples but I\u2019ve got nothing. Please help: john.ashdown@theguardian.com Europe\u2019s The Final Countdown blares out at the Hive. A colleague of mine here at Guardian Towers once went to see Europe live in convert and they played The Final Countdown three times, which always strikes me as a) hilarious and b) absolutely understandable. The winner of this game faces a trip to Swansea in the fifth round. It\u2019s finally time for surely the tie of the round (on one level at least): The Bees v The Bees at the Hive. It\u2019s been 10 years since these sides were in the same division but the last time the teams met was just over seven years ago and also came in a cup competition, with Barnet dumping Brentford out of the JPT on penalties after a 0-0 draw at Underhill. And just for belt-and-braces, historical fact fans, Barnet have never \u2013 NEVER \u2013 beaten Brentford inside 90 minutes. That said, they\u2019d never beaten Sheffield United before and happily ousted the Blades in the third round with a superb performance at Bramall Lane. While Barnet were providing one of the shocks of the round, Brentford were squeezing past League One Oxford thanks to a late Neal Maupay penalty at Griffin Park. That game, though, has proven the first of a three-match winning run and Thomas Frank\u2019s side haven\u2019t lost since 15 December. That has pushed Brentford away from the Championship relegation zone, so it\u2019s 17th in the National League v 18th in the Championship this evening \u2013 a gap of 70 league places by my count. It could be very interesting. Kick off is at 7.45pm GMT but before that, come join me over here for the FA Cup fifth round draw."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
