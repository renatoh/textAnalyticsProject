Catch up with the earlier episodes here. Click here to read Richard's episode four blog. 'Everything we planned \u2013 it's all happening' The penultimate episode brings more revelations, family reunions and a burger flipper who might be about to bring about the end of the world as Utopia knows it. Anton's wandering accent floats in and out as memories of his former life as Carvel resurface in fits and starts. Milner, blinded by love to the end, is desperate to be the one that \"her\" Philip confides in again. The Carvel family is reunited (doesn't go well), as are the Dugdales, when Michael puts his arse on the line (literally) in a bid to save Jen and Alice. Arby takes Grant and Anton out to the remote military training area where he used to train as a boy (\"mountains and shit\", as Grant neatly surmises). Ian has been set up in the press \u2013 again. This time, for his brother's murder. He really is the Network's go-to fall guy. And the side effects of Becky's Deels kick in with a nasty hallucination of the murdered translator (\"eat my fucking chip!\") 'I'm Mr Rabbit?' Leah and Wilson meet up for the latest entry in Utopia's ongoing series of pub chats. I do love the idea of someone listening in on the next table as they discuss the idea of combining forces to stand in as Mr Rabbit for the captured Milner. And why not? Leah knows the command structure, Wilson's very much the company man now, even Lee seems to be deferring to his judgement. Perhaps \"Mr Rabbit\" could be like M or Q in James Bond \u2013 a title that's passed on, keeping Janus alive. It's not like many people know Mr Rabbit is Milner, after all. One person who learns the truth is Dugdale; a great scene as she tries to convince him that there's been a nobility in her actions, like \"Churchill or Lincoln\". Dugdale thinks she's more like Hitler. Later, he takes some quick advice from Jessica to form an action plan to rescue his family. Teaming up with Becky as his getaway driver, he abseils down the side of the Network's black site building, looking more like the 1960s TV Batman than Bond. 'Newsprint! How very traditional' MP Geoff stares at the headlines in the press calling for him to go, briefly contemplating suicide at his desk until he comes up with a better plan: he's going to blackmail the Network. \"What denomination? Dollars, Sterling, Euro?\" asks Wilson, calling Geoff's bluff as he spots the amateurish mistake. As Wilson points out, if this \"mystery blackmailer\" that Geoff has brought to their attention really wants to be paid in Sterling, it's going to come in \u00a350 notes \u2013 the loot would weigh half a ton. 'Where's dad?' Some moving moments between fathers and sons out on the moors. Grant is pestering Arby to teach him to kill \u2013 but for all his sweary bravado (\"I'm just like you\") it really feels like he's warming to the idea of pretending that Arby is his dad. Anton's patchy memory means that he doesn't recognise Arby \u2013 but instead thinks that Grant is his son. Before shooting Arby, he does realise that Jessica is his daughter, which really winds up Milner (\"She ruined everything for you and me\"). We learn that the numbers on Anton's new drawing show \"the adjustment\", and something else. \"I chose my own,\" Anton admits. \"Roma are the people that Janus will leave fertile.\" And even though she realises that Janus stops the vaccine from working, Milner places the call to her sleeper agent, a \"grown man flipping burgers\" called Terrance. He lays out a stash of guns, phones, cash and carrot sticks, and gets to work. With one week left to go (more!), is there anyone left who can stop Janus? Will V-Day work? And will anyone make it off the moors alive? See you next week. Same Utopia-time, same Utopia-channel. Notes, quotes and queries \u2022 \"Don't smile.\" Jessica takes an alternative approach to photoshoots. \u2022 \"You've got a curtain pole, Ian.\" There's a fine line between finding an improvised weapon and just looking daft. Becky knows where that line is. \u2022 \"Don't use a big one.\" Jessica is on top of the smuggling game. \u2022 If you want to hear more on Utopia's production and apocalyptic vision from Mr Rabbit, Jessica Hyde, writer Dennis Kelly, director Marc Munden and producer Rebekah Wray Rogers, here's a podcast from a Q&amp;A at Bafta. \u2022 \"One minute it's wheat and land rights, the next it's a nuclear standoff.\" Milner's seen it all. \u2022 \"Cock face.\" It's not big or clever, but Becky's insults are one of the ongoing pleasures of Utopia's scripts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
