In Netherland, O'Neill asks the same question, aiming to use cricket as it's played in New York to reveal fresh permutations of the national story that America tells itself. An English-educated writer of Irish and Turkish descent who grew up in Holland and is now a US citizen, O'Neill seems well placed to tell \"postnational\" stories, and the New York reviewers have heaped a lot of praise on what one of them called his \"resonant meditation on the American dream\". As a result, the novel - published here with no particular fanfare - is now riding a juggernaut of transatlantic hype. At the heart of O'Neill's book stands Chuck Ramkissoon, a larger-than-life hustler and Gatsby-like self-inventor who feels that \"the US is not complete, the US has not fulfilled its destiny, it's not fully civilised, until it has embraced the game of cricket\". Born, like James, in Trinidad and descended, like VS Naipaul, from indentured Indian labourers, Chuck - or Khamraj, as he was previously known - operates a numbers racket and a kosher sushi business. But he also has grandiose ambitions for New York's cricketing scene. Cricket, in New York, is played almost exclusively by Caribbean and south Asian immigrants in inhospitable parks in the outer boroughs. Chuck dreams of a stadium, international fixtures, advertising revenues and TV rights. To this end, he lays down a fragile square of turf on a site that he patriotically names Bald Eagle Field. Chuck's story - which we're told at the start will conclude with his body being found in a Brooklyn canal - is pieced together for the reader by Hans van den Broek, a very different kind of immigrant. Hans is a Dutchman who comes to New York from London, where he launched a career as an oil-futures analyst and married a successful English lawyer called Rachel. The two of them move to the US in 1998, settle into a loft apartment in Tribeca and happily accumulate several million dollars. But after Hans's mother's death, and then the September 11 attacks, which cause them to move into the Chelsea Hotel, their marriage falls apart. Rachel returns to London with their infant son, while Hans maunders in Manhattan. A chance encounter prompts him to unpack his old cricket gear, which brings him into Chuck's orbit. Writing a few years later in London (where, it's revealed early on, he's back together with Rachel), Hans sketches out his friendship with Chuck as part of a broader effort to explain his \"distractedness\" and passivity in New York. The results are strikingly uneven. Chuck is a lively character, and Hans's experiences as \"the only white man ... on the cricket fields of New York\" give him access to an American subculture that's rarely been depicted. O'Neill clearly knows this world inside out, and he details its workings with great specificity as well as a feeling for its symbolic heft. On the other hand, the narrative is unwieldily organised, the supporting characters are underdeveloped and the dialogue is often pretty bad. When O'Neill introduces Chuck's surly Jewish business partner, the second thing he has him say is: \"Relax? I got my wife's relatives living at my house and you want me to relax?\" The biggest problem, though, is Hans himself. In addition to being much less interesting than Chuck, he tells the story in a determinedly overambitious style. Hans keeps reminding us that he's a stolid Dutch banker, known for his rationalistic mindset and the \"clunking lexical precision\" of his English. This makes it hard to credit his frequent lyrical flights (\"the alternative and lucky heavens constituted in the island's exhilaratory skyward figures\") and bouts of densely figurative self-analysis (\"we, or certainly I, didn't look upon our circumstances from the observatory offered by a disposition to the more spatial emotions\"). In spite of some fine passages, his elaborate syntax and vigorously yet fitfully Americanised vocabulary finally seem more like a literary contrivance than a plausible human voice. At times it's hard not to wonder whether O'Neill, who's the author of an admired memoir as well as being a long-term member of the Staten Island Cricket Club, might not have done better to write a memoir-essay on New York cricket. And when Hans starts spending time with the eccentric denizens of the Chelsea, some readers might worry about what Joan Didion once called New York's \"insistent sentimentalisation of experience\". Yet O'Neill's take on the notion of the American dream is both unsentimental and cleverly attuned to that notion's grip on the local imagination. Perhaps stories of striving immigrants and America's ambiguous promise speak to New York reviewers on frequencies inaudible to outsiders. O'Neill has said that he wrote the book as \"an American novel ... My first novel as an American novelist\", and in this respect, he seems to have succeeded."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
