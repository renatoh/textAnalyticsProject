But Paul Scholes appears to have overcome a groin injury. Giggs said yesterday he was staying put, despite interest from Internazionale. \"The only time I thought about playing abroad was when I was younger,\" he said. \"At that time Serie A was the top league, but once I became successful with United I wanted it to carry on. I am happy here and have over three years left on my contract. I want to end the best playing days of my career at United. The way I see it, that is what is going to happen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
