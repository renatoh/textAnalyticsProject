A red light warns that a take is in progress. A solitary lighting engineer is fully reclined, two-thirds of the way through The Da Vinci Code. Suddenly the red light goes out. An extra and a sound man appear, pick up some rubber tubing and commence a mock light-sabre duel. Someone's mobile phone goes off: the Cantina theme from Star Wars. Now visitors are allowed on to the set: a neat jungle of plywood and scaffolding, fashioned into an airlock, a control room, a futuristic bedroom. And corridors. Lots and lots of corridors. Even the stooges on Space Cadets would probably not be fooled into thinking they were on a real spaceship, but it is impressive nonetheless - especially when you consider that this is not the set of the latest Hollywood blockbuster, but a BBC sitcom. A sitcom? Has the corporation paid no heed to Victoria Wood's baleful warning that situation comedy is dead? Well, if it is, they're giving it a lavish send-off. Hyperdrive is the brainchild of Kevin Cecil and Andy Riley, who, as well as contributing to the latest series of Little Britain, won Baftas for their work on Black Books and Robbie the Reindeer. The cast, too, comes with a pedigree: Nick Frost (Spaced, Shaun of the Dead), Kevin Eldon (Nighty Night, Big Train), Miranda Hart (Absolutely Fabulous). From the beginning, say the writers, there was a determination not to compromise. Along with producer Alex Walsh-Taylor, they set out to hire director John Henderson, who, though he began his career in TV on such shows as Not the Nine O'Clock News and Spitting Image, had long since graduated to film: Loch Ness with Ted Danson, Bring Me the Head of Mavis Davis with Rik Mayall. What, then, persuaded him to return to his roots? \"They were the funniest scripts I'd read in years. I'm not precious - it's not as if I'll only do feature films - I just love working on quality pieces.\" And Henderson proved a valuable ally in the team's next financial battle. \"It was going to be on video,\" says the director, \"but I pointed out the advantages of shooting on film, and having a full film score. If you want your audience to laugh, they've got to feel comfortable. The warm-up comes from you feeling good about the look of the film.\" Presumably there were similar wrangles over the budget for the set, which takes up a good three-quarters of the 19,000 sq ft studio. \"I can't tell you how much it cost,\" says Walsh-Taylor. \"Not because I'm not allowed to, but because it hasn't stopped costing yet.\" Yes, there is no doubt that they are proud of their set. When it is innocently suggested that the corridors are slightly reminiscent of Blake's 7, Riley almost chokes on his coffee. \"We are connoisseurs of corridors,\" he insists. \"I know our corridors aren't like Blake's 7. Blake's 7's corridors were hexagonal.\" Henderson is particularly bullish about the look of the show. \"I think the Doctor Who lot are scared, because our production values are better than theirs,\" he says, with a David Tennant-style twinkle. (On this point, the writers are quick to stifle suggestions that the series was greenlit only after the BBC's success story of 2005. \"Doctor Who was commissioned after we did the pilot,\" says Cecil. \"We just had to wait around for months until the next financial year so BBC2 could budget for it.\") But it is not comparisons with Blake's 7 or Doctor Who that the team fear most. Because, of course, the terms \"BBC\", \"sci-fi\" and \"sitcom\" have cropped up together once before. \"The RD [Red Dwarf] word is banned on set,\" says Walsh-Taylor, with an audible groan. \"Look, it was a great series,\" concedes Riley, \"but whenever there's a new police drama, people don't all compare it to Hill Street Blues, do they?\" As it happens, the script does not call for much in the way of technical wizardry. Hyperdrive is set only 150 years in the future and one of its chief premises is that, contrary to the fanciful predictions of most sci-fi, nothing will have changed that much. \"People will still have tea, still have to pay their gas bill, and still watch football,\" says Frost. \"It's quite a traditional sitcom. It doesn't need to be set in space. It just happens to be.\" On the other hand, says Cecil, we should not be expecting Terry and June. \"I'm fairly sure it's the only sitcom in which nuclear weapons are deployed twice in the course of a series.\" All questions about the exact cost of the show are adroitly deflected: \"It was enough to do what we did.\" Even so, this is not Hollywood; there must have been some great ideas they could not afford to make work. \"No, but there were some bad ideas we couldn't make work,\" says Riley, to a chorus of laughter. Cecil then describes an aborted episode in which the ship's crew were required to race a robot: \"Utterly unfilmable. Alex was very good. He took one look at it, and said, 'Why don't we do something else?'\" For the most part, then, it seems the production team got everything they wanted. Does Henderson think this marks a sea change in the BBC's approach to comedy? \"It could well be. There's no doubt that if the BBC wish to keep their licence fee, what they mustn't do is try to compete with ITV on ITV's territory. They have to put more money into their production, the writers, the directors. That way, they will attract all the other talent. \"When I worked on Not the Nine O'Clock News, ratings figures were not allowed in the building.\" He is clearly warming to his theme. \"Its producer John Lloyd never knew how many people watched it - or how much it cost. I love the BBC, but it's too worried about competing. I'd like to see a BBC that only cares about quality programming.\" For the Hyperdrive team, then, the sitcom is far from dead. Perhaps, to borrow a metaphor from science-fiction, it is simply in cryogenic suspension, awaiting the day when a cure can be found. A cure that, according to John Henderson, might be as simple as a well-aimed injection of cash. \u00b7 Hyperdrive starts on Wednesday at 10pm on BBC2"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
