Hours before kick-off in Newcastle United's home match against Hull - the club's first game since Keegan resigned as manager, which ended in a 2-1 defeat - thousands of supporters gathered outside St James' Park to vent their frustration against owner Mike Ashley and the board. Police in high-visibility jackets had struggled to control the surging crowd in a noisy but peaceful protest at the club gates. Fans chanted 'Sack the board', 'We want Ashley out', and 'There's only one Kevin Keegan'. The protest was so loud that the fans' voices could be heard at Grey's Monument, a 10-minute walk from the stadium. Keegan stepped down on 4 September after his authority was alleged to have been undermined by the United board."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
