This seems a mistake, given that the coming-of-age story of a group of teenagers on an American airbase in Italy is so clearly a slow burner. It has been described by those in the US as exquisite, lyrical, poetic and in many other terms that loosely translate as \u201cadmirable, a talent showcase and yet ever so slightly boring at first sight\u201d. Allowing for that handicap, then, let us sally forth and, like protagonist Fraser \u2013 roaming round the new home his US colonel mother, Sarah (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny), and her wife, Maggie (a mere major, played by Alice Braga), have brought him to \u2013 see what there is for us. At 14, Fraser (brilliantly played by Jack Dylan Grazer) is an unlovely piece of work. Face (complete with bumfluff moustache) set in a permanent sneer, headphones plugged as permanently into his ears, he is a self-indulgent mass of hormones and attitude. He is full of contempt for humanity and resentment of Sarah, who has brought the family to the Venuto military base so that she can take over from the outgoing commander. During one extended sequence of Frazer\u2019s explorations of his new territory, my notes record that \u201che\u2019s even annoying riding a bike\u201d. Fortunately, before he becomes too repellent to the viewer, he is taken up by Britney, an emollient presence (played by Francesca Scorsese \u2013 yes, daughter of) who introduces him to her gang of friends. It includes a girl who has already caught his eye, Caitlin (newcomer Jordan Kristine Seam\u00f3n), whom he later discovers posing as a boy at a cafe off the base and chatting up a girl. It is Fraser \u2013 who has an intense friendship with someone called Mark back home in New York, and an eye for a handsome soldier himself \u2013 who will introduce her to the concept of a non-binary identity and the ability to move between or abandon the expectations society has set up for you. Although We Are Who We Are is primarily a coming of age story, it is also one deeply interested in liminality \u2013 a very teenage concern too, of course, even if they rarely give their emotional insecurities, navigation of the treacherous crossing from the child to adult world, and their trying on and discarding of various social roles and positions such a name. The base itself is America within Italy, but its border is porous and the gang pick up some Italian language, as well as befriending soldiers of all nationalities within it. Sarah and Maggie are gay women in an aggressively heteromasculine world, always having to approach and respond circumspectly to inferiors\u2019 and superiors\u2019 reactions. There are strange transgressions in Fraser\u2019s family dynamic. Sarah and Maggie make little effort not to let him see them slipping into the bath together, and while his mother may rule with a rod of iron outside the home, she allows Fraser to demand alcohol from her and to slap her face without comeback when she fails to make a sandwich to his liking. When she cuts her finger, Fraser sucks it like a baby. When Maggie rescues him from what is evidently just the latest in a long line of drunken escapades, they have a (too?) adult conversation about how much Sarah loves each of them. \u201cSometimes when she\u2019s kissing me,\u201d says Maggie, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t acknowledge me. It feels like she\u2019s kissing a mirror.\u201d Fraser remains convinced he is second in his mother\u2019s affections, and when she comes near to hug him and talk he is still young enough to cry \u201cinvisible shield, invisible shield!\u201d to repel her. If beautifully shot, languorously paced character and mood pieces are your thing, you are going to be very happy with eight hours of this, especially if it maintains the opening episode\u2019s ability to avoid ever tipping into smugness at just how much beauty and talent it has managed to assemble and play with. For others, unless that languorous pace picks up just a little and the characters become just a little more active, and the mood is driven by something more tangible than the sun-saturated landscape, We Are Who We Are may feel too inert to be worth keeping faith with. At the moment it feels slightly hollow \u2013 a confection of surfaces rather than a whole, pulsing story. At the same time, there is clearly rich potential here, and much that could and maybe will be done with it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
