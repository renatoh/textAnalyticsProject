They've evolved from No Wave-immersed New Yorkers through to pioneering noise-makers and now alt-rock elders. Their 16th album, the upcoming The Eternal, sees them back on an indie label and skilfully pulling together the strands of their past with their recently honed gift for making rounded, melodic songs. Moore snarls through the insolent groove of No Way, while beside him slinks Kim Gordon, swapping her trademark bass for guitar. Her fringe as long as her black chiffon dress is short, she yelps and coos through Calming the Snake, oblivious to a leaping, electrified Moore and the violent moves and uncompromising sounds of fellow guitarist Lee Ranaldo. Together since 1981, the three are instinctively aware of one another's every move and must be intimidating company for bassist Mark Ibold, who replaced Jim O'Rourke in 2006. He wanders to the front of the stage, leaving the spotlight to fall on Ranaldo's blistering instrumentation and Gordon and Moore's megawatt charisma. \"Keep it in your pants,\" Moore advises the bullish crowd who shout song requests and endearments. Dedicating the awesome Schizophrenia to \"all you bitches\", Moore has words of thanks for recent shows by Bob Dylan and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. But Gordon's mind is solely on Sonic Youth: \"When we come back, you'll know all the new songs and we won't have to play these oldies.\" But the likes of Hey Joni and The Sprawl are as intoxicating as ever and after two encores, Sonic Youth end with Kool Thing, just as they did in '91: still challenging, still winning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
