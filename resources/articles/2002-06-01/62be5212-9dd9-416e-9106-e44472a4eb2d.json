South Korea believes that the so-called football superpowers simply cannot tolerate being humbled by a team who began the tournament as 150-1 outsiders. \"Whose conspiracy?\" was the front-page headline in yesterday's Korean Times, whose reporters have been receiving 50 to 100 abusive emails a day from Spain, Italy and Portugal, and the newspaper's leader column yesterday was headed \"So many sour grapes\". \"It is racism with a small 'r' - the condescending colonial attitude that has been imported to this region from the west for too long,\" it said. \"South Koreans care immensely about what foreigners think about their country. It can seem like an inferiority complex but it is a deep respect for the opinion of outsiders and it has led to the football world being embraced into one of the warmest and friendliest editions of he game's quadrennial gatherings. Now the western world, not for the first time, is abusing this hospitality. For once, Koreans should ignore their opinions.\" The Korean captain Hong Myung-bo agreed: \"All this talk about controversy is something that has been concocted by teams who do not like seeing a small nation do well. But it is overshadowing our success, and that is not right.\" At least it is not affecting the esteem in which Hiddink is held. The Gwangju Stadium, venue of Korea's quarter-final defeat of Spain, is to be renamed the Hiddink Stadium and the coach is to be given the freedom of the town, with the main thoroughfare and one of the most prominent buildings named after him. Korean travel agents are now offering a pilgrimage to the Netherlands, taking in the house in Varsseveld where Hiddink was brought up and a tour of the clubs where he played or managed. One can only imagine the Hiddink mania should his team win today. \"That is what we aim to do,\" he said. \"The ultimate dream is to reach the final. We want to win the World Cup, and we want to do it the right way.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
