We have a very old, big (25ftx25ft) Magnolia soulangiana in our garden and I can't bear to lose it but it shades our sitting space in summer and is a nuisance for the neighbours. Can we prune it? I don't want to spoil its lovely shape. Carol Sudbery, Sheffield A In a word Carol, yes. As long as you do your cutting as soon as possible before growth restarts in March. It will regrow from the old wood, so don't be timid - cut hard to encourage vigorous new growth and mulch with a good few inches of garden compost. But if you can't do this in the next few weeks, wait until autumn. Q Ants building a nest under my potato barrel have apparently ruined the crop on both of my attempts, whether in semi-shade, on paving, or in the greenhouse. They produced much foliage but no potatoes. Advice please! Eve Pigg, Peterborough A First piece of advice Eve, stop making two and two make five. What did you think the ants were doing, secretly running a chippy? Ants do very little damage in the garden other than ant hills on a lawn. I wonder when you were growing your potatoes - if you plant later than midsummer, you radically reduce the chances of a crop, though there will be plenty of top growth. The other factor that affects container-grown potatoes is lack of moisture. They need a lotof water and very rich compost to produce a crop in a container. But please stop blaming the ants. \u00b7 If you have a question for Monty, email ask.monty@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
