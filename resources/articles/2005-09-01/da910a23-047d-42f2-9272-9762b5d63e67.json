Mr Kebble, 41, was driving to a dinner party in Johannesburg's wealthy Melrose suburb on Tuesday night when his car was hit by a hail of bullets. The businessman was known for complex deals that many condemned as shady. In August shareholders forced him to resign as the chief executive of three interlinked South African mining firms. He was also an active supporter of the ruling African National Congress and author of \"black empowerment\" schemes for black businessmen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
