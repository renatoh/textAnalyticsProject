May is meeting senior executives from Google, Facebook and Microsoft on the sidelines of the UN in New York on Wednesday alongside her French and Italian counterparts, Emmanuel Macron and Paul Gentiloni. The meeting comes amid growing concerns that groups such as Islamic State are able to produce and distribute videos and online magazines too readily. Home Office analysis shows that Isis shared 27,000 links to extremist content in the first five months of the 2017 and, once shared, the material remained available online for an average of 36 hours. The government would like that reduced to two hours, and ultimately they are urging companies to develop technology to spot material early and prevent it being shared in the first place. The prime minister will tell Wednesday\u2019s event that Isis material is still available on the internet for \u201ctoo long\u201d after being posted. This can include links to videos glorifying terrorism and material encouraging converts to commit acts of the kind that were carried out in Westminster and Barcelona earlier this year, involving vehicles or knives. May will say: \u201cTerrorist groups are aware that links to their propaganda are being removed more quickly, and are placing a greater emphasis on disseminating content at speed in order to stay ahead. \u201cIndustry needs to go further and faster in automating the detection and removal of terrorist content online, and developing technological solutions that prevent it being uploaded in the first place.\u201d The issue is of particular concern after last week\u2019s attack on a London Underground train at Parsons Green, and follows a British thinktank report on Tuesday, which found that online jihadist propaganda attracts more clicks in Britain than anywhere else in Europe. Macron and May discussed the issue when the pair met in June, and suggested they would consider more robust action, including imposing fines on companies that fail to act. They are demanding evidence of progress by the time of a meeting of G7 interior ministers in Rome on 20 October. The government is targeting \u201cdisseminators\u201d \u2013 platforms such as Twitter, through which the content is shared; \u201ccontent stores\u201d such as the filesharing site YouTube; and \u201caggregators\u201d such as WordPress, where extremist content is stored. They would like the companies to cut back the window of time during which the material can be actively shared, and to develop technologies to recognise extremist content and prevent it being uploaded in the first place. Extremist material is shared very rapidly when it is first published in what experts call a \u201cstarburst\u201d effect: more than two-thirds of shares take place within the first two hours, so reducing the amount of time the material is visible can drastically squeeze the number of users who see it \u2013 and the government believes internet companies could do more. \u201cThey have been doing something, but just not enough,\u201d said a government source. \u201cIn particular, the government believes they could do more to develop new technology that would identify extremist content before it can be shared. \u201cThese companies have some of the best brains in the world. They should really be focusing that on what matters, which is stopping the spread of terrorism and violence.\u201d The source added that once an internet user has shown interest in extremist content, the web giants\u2019 algorithms keep pushing similar material towards them online. \u201cWe want them to break the echo chambers,\u201d he said. Google and YouTube have said they are increasing their use of technology to help automatically identify videos. Twitter suspended 299,649 accounts between 1 January and 30 June this year, with 75% of accounts suspended before their first tweet. Facebook has also stated publicly that it is looking at developing artificial intelligence to automate the identification of terrorist material. Terrorism will be one of the main themes of May\u2019s speech to the UN general assembly on Wednesday lunchtime. She will reflect on the attacks on the UK this year, and call for more to be done to root out the ideology that drives them. \u201cAs prime minister, I have visited too many hospitals and seen too many innocent people murdered in my country,\u201d she will say. \u201cWhen I think of the hundreds of thousands of victims of terrorism in countries across the world, I think of their friends, their families, their communities, devastated by this evil. And I say enough is enough.\u201d She will add, \u201cultimately it is not just the terrorists themselves who we need to defeat. It is the extremist ideologies that fuel them. It is the ideologies that preach hatred, sow division and undermine our common humanity. We must be far more robust in identifying these ideologies and defeating them \u2013 across all parts of our societies.\u201d Internet executives attending the web summit will include Kent Walker, who is general counsel at Google; Monika Bickert, head of global policy at Facebook; and David Heiner, deputy general counsel at Microsoft. The New York event will also be attended by advertisers including WPP, because the UK government hopes they will be one source of pressure on the companies to take a tough approach. Smaller firms are also being supported to beef up their technology to detect extremist content more successfully; and the government hopes to encourage the spread of \u201ccounter-narratives\u201d from civil society groups offering an alternative perspective. Meanwhile, YouTube has been strongly criticised for failing to take down more than 120 Islamist and far-right extremist videos, including material promoting Adolf Hitler and the Taliban, despite complaints. The disclosure comes as the result of a three-month study commissioned by Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons home affairs committee, who said it was \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d that 61 far-right extremist and 60 Islamist extremist videos remained online weeks after being reported. \u201cIt is simply unacceptable that YouTube are taking so long to remove material that contains images and content that glorify extremist violence,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s Islamist extremism or far-right extremism, the reality is that this material is far too far easy to access.\u201d YouTube insisted, however, that it was stepping up efforts to tackle online extremism and said the majority of such videos removed in the past month had been taken down before any complaint had been received. The social media giant, Twitter, also disclosed that it had suspended almost 300,000 accounts in the first six months of 2017 for violations relating to the promotion of terrorism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
