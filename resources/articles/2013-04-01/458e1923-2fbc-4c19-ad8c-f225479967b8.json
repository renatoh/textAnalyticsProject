The first of the programme's ballets, Jir\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n's Petite Mort, is a particularly canny choice. Kyli\u00e1n is a choreographer of many parts, sometimes ludic, often obscure. But as a craftsman, a fabricator of perfectly tongued-and-grooved neoclassical dance, he is without equal. His work is often overlaid with a lush, suggestive surface texture \u2013 velvety lighting, fashion-designer costumes \u2013 and while this has earned him a worldwide cult following, it has also led to accusations of fixation on style at the expense of deep content. His relationship with the London critics has been, to say the least, combative. Rojo, herself a notably combative individual, is aware of this, and in opening her directorial account with Petite Mort is issuing an unequivocal mission statement: from now on, everything changes. The gamble pays. This is Kyli\u00e1n at his finest, interrogating notions of vanity, sex and death with a very cold eye indeed. The piece opens with six men of the company fetishistically manipulating fencing foils, luxuriating in their flexion and phallic lethality, exploring the parallels with their own steely physiques. James Forbat, in particular, nails the mood of the piece, dispensing a brutal, sardonic narcissism. Framed by Kyli\u00e1n against a Mozart piano concerto, these attitudes are at once foolish and melancholy, as are those of the six women who follow the men. Apparently gowned in black, they soon reveal their costumes as separate, wheeled structures from which they step away. A series of duets ensues in which men and women appear to vie for sexual ascendance, and here it's the sprung force and erotic attack of Laurretta Summerscales which engraves itself most memorably against the inky shadows. Things get darker with Roland Petit's Le Jeune Homme et la Mort, danced by Rojo and the Paris Opera Ballet star Nicolas Le Riche. A morbid tale of unrequited obsession created in 1946, set with calculated irony to a Bach passacaglia and saturated with existential despair, this piece has always demanded star performances, which Rojo and Le Riche deliver. As he quivers with tortured sexual longing, at intervals unleashing leaps of furious precision, she coils around him like a cat on heat and stalks his garret in vampish, vampiric triumph. Rojo's taunting siren works because it contains so much of Rojo herself. As both dancer and director, she has a sophisticated understanding of the bait-and-switch game of compelling audience attention. Le Riche, meanwhile, brings a shattering intensity to the role of the young artist, and demonstrates just how far beyond classroom steps ballet can go. It is with classroom steps, nevertheless, that the evening's final offering opens. A display piece, building to a spectacular finale, Etudes shows the company at full stretch, and promises fine things for the future. Alexei Ratmansky choreographed the National Ballet of Canada's Romeo and Juliet to replace the John Cranko version, which had been in the company's repertoire since 1964. It's a pared-down production, dispensing with the Rosalind subplot and the kind of hokey stage business which involves street vendors suspiciously biting coins. In their place, Ratmansky makes space for dancing. Big, folksy ensemble pieces for the townspeople, goofy off-classical struts for Mercutio (Piotr Stanczyk) and Benvolio (Robert Stephen), and for the lovers (husband-and-wife duo Guillaume C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Heather Ogden) stage-consuming solos and duets whose airy curves are undercut by sharp little coup\u00e9s and impulsive changes of direction. If the delicate filigree of Ratmansky's 24 Preludes, made earlier this year for the Royal Ballet, shows us the choreographer in rococo mood, here he delivers a fuller-blown Romanticism. His musicality is impeccable, but he's inclined to gild the lily. There are moments, as Kenneth MacMillan demonstrated with such eloquence in his own 1965 version of the ballet, when a look or a limpid stillness conveys more than an ornate flurry of steps. In C\u00f4t\u00e9, however, Ratmansky has a Romeo whose romantic stage presence is complemented by elaborate choreography. Ratmansky likes to create an interplay between formality and spontaneity, and C\u00f4t\u00e9, with his elegant line, expansive arms and sensuous \u00e9paulement, embodies this approach perfectly. He and Ogden are in constant motion, and where his dancing is deep and grounded, she is all nervy verticality, her staccato phrasing echoing the flutter of Juliet's heart, and her flying temps lev\u00e9s and scissoring jet\u00e9s expressive of her desperate adolescent yearning. C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Ogden convey their love convincingly, but there is a close-focused quality to Ratmansky's narrative which precludes the sense of grand tragedy. Designer Richard Hudson gives us a landscape like a Mantegna painting, the women in bright, colour-blocked skirts, the men in the red caps, belted tunics and pied tights of the late 15th-century Mantuan court. These characters play out their stories before a castellated edifice whose lack of perspective depth somehow leaches the immediacy from the events enacted before it. As in many quattrocento paintings, the peripheral activity has a detached, dreamlike quality. As Romeo, Mercutio and Tybalt play out their lethally predestined roles, the onlookers strike statuesque attitudes and thoughtfully compare sword-blades. Ratmansky, in other words, gives us mises en sc\u00e8ne upon which to meditate, rather than a drama in which to lose ourselves. This will appeal to some audience members more than others, but then that's true of most of his work. Unpredictability is all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
