The reforms proposed by the Commons public administration committee, chaired by Labour's Tony Wright, who holds a genuine, not honorary, doctorate, would not bring an end to the humble MBE or its posher bretheren, the OBE and the CBE. But an MBE would no longer confer Membership of the British Empire, but Membership of British Excellence, a deft attempt (first suggested in 1993 by the still-unknighted commoner, John Major) to combine unsettling change with reassuring continuity. The Order dates only from 1917, part of an earlier democratising of the honours system. Out would go the genuinely cob-webbed Order of the Bath, dating from the middle ages and revived in 1725. So would the Order of St Michael and St George (founded in 1818), which carries a knight-or-damehood in three categories and is nowadays a prezzie for status-conscious senior diplomats. The very grand and wholly untainted Order of Merit (OM), restricted (like the Garter) to 24 non-royal members, and a gift of the monarch, would survive the Wright stuff. So would the almost unsullied Companionship of Honour (CH), recently accepted by leftwing playwright Harold Pinter. There would be more CHs to make up for the phasing out of knighthoods over five years. Existing peerages and hereditary knights (baronets) would be allowed to parade their lineage - though, as the former foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, otherwise the Right Hon Lord Hurd of Westwell, CH, CBE - told the MPs, it would mean that the only people with such titles will soon be those who did not earn them personally. They will still work when booking restaurant tables. The whole issue is shot through with anomalies of this kind, and students of the honours system, stern leftwing republicans as well as misty-eyed rightwing romantics, will find lots to raise their blood pressure inside the two fact-packed volumes of A Matter of Honour: Reforming the Honours System (Stationery Office \u00a314.50, and via the parliamentary website). Scots who believe they have been shortchanged on the honours front (apart from the Most Ancient and Noble Order of the Thistle, revived in 1687, of course) will be disabused. With 9% of the population, they get 13% of the gongs. It is north-west England ( 11% of the population, 7% of the gongs) which gets chiselled. For once, even London and the south-east only get 4% more than their share, 31% of the 10,000 awards made from the Queen's Birthday Honours in 1999 to this January's New Year's Honours. Women's shares range from 14.5% to 40%, below their numerical deserts; black and ethnic recipients (7.9% of the population) get between 4.2% and 7%. The MPs want to do better by all concerned except the automatic CMGs (Call Me God), KCMGs (Kindly Call Me God) and GCMGs (God Calls Me God), so treasured in Whitehall. There should be no automaticity, says Dr Wright whose publications include GDH Cole and Socialist Democracy and a biograph of RH Tawney. Cole and Tawney, both socialist saints, took no honours. So the committee proposes merging the existing honours committees - usually male, white and elderly members of the highly-valued Order of the Freedom Pass (OFP) which confers cheap travel to pensioners. The committee also commends transparency, integrity, dignity, clarity and fairness (as well as excellence) as the guiding principles of the future honours system. Worthy local achievement should also be a principle, say the MPs. They share the evident disdain expressed by many witnesses before the committee for flashy, celeb-driven awards, gongs routinely handed out to civil servants, and those \"lubricants of state\", the K's and peerages which reflect political horse-trading; ministerial sackings as well as awards that big party donors often get, ostensibly for \"services to charity\". While expressing unease about such high jinks (which peaked in the 1920s when Lloyd George raised funds by selling honours) the MPs found little evidence of \"serious corruption\", but a strong desire that deserving citizens should be recognised. Holders may get a modest badge or pin to wear - like the French Legion d'Honneur. The report says: \"The criteria should emphasise that eminent service at local level would be regarded as being just as meritorious as the same sort of service at national level.\" Many ordinary citizens whose names are not in Who's Who or the newspapers enjoy the rituals of dressing up to visit Buckingham Palace and meet the Queen. Removing the taint of politics, including the prime minister's twice-annual list, would be desirable, the MPs suggest. Though the premier of the day rarely does more than rubber stamp many names (Harold Wilson's notorious \"lavender list\" was largely drawn up by his political secretary, Lady Falkender), it does not help. \"The regular conferral of knighthoods on MPs is sometimes viewed, cynically, as a mere tool of political party management,\" the committee concedes with mas terful understatement. Their own membership includes Sir Sidney Chapman, a genial Tory workhorse who also has two honourary degrees and the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal. Another Tory member, Michael Trend, is an Hon because his father, an ex-cabinet secretary, was made a peer. His CBE is for party work, though he is leaving politics under a cloud of disputed expenses. The committee have looked to the Commonwealth for ways to modernise the system, especially to Australia where the title \"larrikin\" - a mischievous jack-the-lad - is now more valued than a K. The MPs did not seek much inspiration from republican France ,where gongs are awarded at four times the UK (3,000 a year) rate, let alone from Italy, which awards 20,000 medals a year and has 850,000 living members of the Order of Work. Tony Blair has set up his own inquiry run by a knighted bureaucrat of legendary smoothness, Sir Hayden Phillips, which is expected out on Friday. Meanwhile pantomime dames are unaffected. 'I am thrilled I am going to be Empirish' Jilly Cooper, novelist, appointed OBE in June \"Oh come on! Are they going to change the Victoria Cross to the Common Cross because they are so anti-monarchy? There is an obsession with semantics these days. \"I was so pleased to receive the OBE, I didn't think about the empire at all. You get this envelope through the post and you think 'Oh God, it's a gas bill' and then you open it and it says 'the prime minister is pleased ...' and you re-read it about six times. \"I could be one of the last OBEs. I am thrilled I am going to be Empirish rather than Excellent.\" Colin Parry, founder of Children for Peace charity after an IRA bomb killed his son in Warrington in 1993, appointed OBE in June \"It is wrong to routinely get an accolade after a lifetime career in the civil service or army. Whether it is a general or Mrs Mop who has pushed the Hoover around the Ministry of Defence, I don't think they should be awarded something for doing what they were paid to do, even if they did it well. \"But I don't like the idea of dropping the 'e' for 'empire', even though we haven't got one any more. The traditions going back centuries are what gives the system its sense of history.\" Professor Mohammed Wahab, managing director of Delta Microelectronics, appointed OBE in June \"I work for a Danish company and when they heard about my OBE they were surprised that 'empire' comes into it. \"I don't believe it is a racist term. The meaning of 'empire' is that you colonise other countries but I don't think people view it like that these days. \"The honours system has moved a long way from what used to happen many years ago. The fact that members of the public can nominate people helps a great deal.\" Alan Steer, headteacher of Seven Kings High School, in Ilford, Essex, received a knighthood in June \"My wife said I looked as if somebody had hit me on the head with a brick. \"It's not something that you expect to get through the post on a Saturday morning. Teaching in a multicultural London school, I would have thought the days of the British empire might be left to history, but I would not have accepted the honour had I thought it was improper. \"It was a tribute not just to myself but to a large number of other people. It is up to others to judge whether it is merited or not.\" Professor Gus John, racial equality activist and chief executive of the Gus John Partnership, turned down a CBE in 2000. \"I had to decline because everything I have done in my life in this country since 1964 has been in the struggle for racial equality and social justice. \"One of the major impediments to promoting racial equality is the legacy of empire. \"I believe the whole thing is iniquitous. People think I'm being churlish campaigning against empire but I am struggling to end the injustice and inequality that whole damn thing is built upon.\" \u00b7 Interviews by Patrick Barkham"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
