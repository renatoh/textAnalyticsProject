Biblion, already both a prestige cooperative where 100 dealers display an epitome of their stock, and a website where 500 dealers list several million titles, has extended a third leg, helpful to balance and balance sheet. Biblion Auctions shares premises with the bookshop, just off Oxford Street and handy for Phillips and Sotheby's; as is Bloomsbury Book Auctions, recently returned from its long self-exile in Islington to posh-book heartland. Biblion displayed its credentials in its first sale, with some fine private press books, the obligatory Tolkien trilogy, and even an uncorrected proof of G Taylor's Shadowmancer, which has been - according to a blurb quoting the Times - \"hailed as the biggest event in children's fiction since Harry Potter\" (a hail that has hailed several other events). Bibliophile was more concerned - as spectator - with lot 206, the Darwinists' black tulip, a signed presentation copy of On the Origin of Species. Darwin would regularly send his publisher, John Murray, a list of people to get presentation copies, and these would be inscribed \"with the author's compliments\" (or \"greetings\" or \"kind regards\") by dutiful clerks. Specialists can identify Clerk 1, Clerk 2, Clerk 3; except for various Darwins and the occasional Wedgwood, however, nobody was known to have received a copy inscribed by Charles himself. But the author got six free copies on publication, and it is not astonishing that some of these would be surplus to his own - or the family's - requirements. They don't often appear on the market: the last, to an unnamed recipient, was observed in 1973, leaving the auction rooms with Maggs (it cost him \u00a3800 then, and might be today's copy). Lot 206 is only the second edition of 1860: but bidders can't be choosers, not if they are acting for exigent collectors. (There was a presentation copy of the first edition bobbing about some 20 years ago: the signature was certainly genuine, but it was lacking a couple of preliminary leaves, at least when Bibliophile first saw it.) It was hard to predict what multiple of \u00a3800 the book would make: the catalogue estimate was a downbeat \u00a37,000-\u00a310,000. In the event, it made \u00a338,000, to an unknown telephone bidder, against Simon Finch, a London dealer with high taste and deep pockets, and shoulders, this time, eloquent of bereavement. What then will folk pay this year, next year, sometime, to own a first edition with a warm message to a close friend or significant colleague, Huxley, say, or Wallace, or a sarcastic note to Richard Owen, when one turns up unexpectedly? There is no algorithm for such an event. If a signature increases the price of the second edition twentyfold, will it raise a first edition from \u00a360,000 to \u00a31.2m? Or should one or both numbers be squared or cubed? Shrugging off these immensities, Bibliophile bought and sold a very scarce and little-desired tract on luminous jellyfish, and was well pleased.
