Writer-director Jon Jones\u2019s work has some subtlety, although it comes perilously close to the water\u2019s edge of maudlin sentiment, and does, in fact, wet its toes, especially in the final stages. But the performances from the pre-adolescent cast are striking and powerful enough to win this some serious regard, and at the very least a place in the viewing queue for casting agents looking for young talent. In this strong ensemble Noa Thomas stands out as Davy, a kid of 13 or so who spends his long summer days hanging out with his brother Iwan (Gruffydd Weston) and two brothers from the neighbouring farm, Rhys (Rowan Jones) and Robbie (Christopher Benning). After a fine day\u2019s exploring the woods with Rhys and Robbie\u2019s frisky, near uncontrollable sheepdog Rex (the unimaginative name is in itself a great period detail), tickling fish and stalking a barn owl, a horrific tragedy happens out of nowhere. Jones holds tight on Thomas as Davy bears witness to the aftermath, torn between a desire to help and a sense of impotence in a suddenly much more serious, far more inexplicable world than the one he woke up in. The camerawork reflects and mimics his point of view but doesn\u2019t overdo it. The endgame is judiciously judged. While Weston\u2019s Iwan is a touch too optimistic, you get the sense that Jones truly understands and treasures the foolish heroism of young boys."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
