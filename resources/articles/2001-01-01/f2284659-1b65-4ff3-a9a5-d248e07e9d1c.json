But he has spent much of this season overshadowed by Thierry Henry and has only managed two goals in 21 appearances. Last October, Bergkamp complained the club had shown him a \"total lack of respect\" when negotiations began on a new contract and said he believed he was being frozen out. But today he was delighted to sign a new contract, admitting: \"I've stayed for the right reasons - because I love playing for Arsenal,\" he said on Tuesday. \"I've been here for nearly six years now and had some great times. \"Some of the sentiments that people have offered me have made me quite emotional. I don't mean to sound melodramatic, but when people say that I'm really important and valued here it's quite touching,\" he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
