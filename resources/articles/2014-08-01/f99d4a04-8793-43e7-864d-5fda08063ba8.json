There the hummocky hills of sand and gravel are a unique memorial of the Ice Age: the finest series of terminal moraines of glaciers to be seen in Britain. Most of them have become obscured by afforestation in recent years and a few have been destroyed by quarrying for flints of high silica content; but there are still some unspoiled tracts of open country purple with heather and splashed with the gold of dwarf gorse (Ulex gallii) in August. Rabbits have come back in moderate numbers since myxomatosis and the heath grasses are short again after a period of unlimited overgrowth, so that the character of the heaths is much as it used to be long ago, with a variety of dwarf plants flourishing on the acid sands, and grayling butterflies dashing round everywhere. There is one difference, however. An alien plant from New Zealand, the pirri-pirri burr (Acaena anserinifolia) is now widespread alongside a great many of the paths and it covers large areas of what was formerly turf. It looks rather like salad burnet, with its spherical heads of green, red-tipped flowers and is quite pleasing to the eye; but its fruits are devilishly spiny and hooked, so, as you walk through its carpets, your socks very soon become intensely prickly as the seeds work their way into your flesh. For the same reason it is now impossible to sit down and enjoy a picnic except where the heather is thickest. So far, this insidious alien has not found its way to the dunes along the Norfolk coast. If it were to become established there, as it has on Holy Island, off Northumberland, it could cause much trouble, because the seeds have a way of getting into the eyes of young sea birds and blinding them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
