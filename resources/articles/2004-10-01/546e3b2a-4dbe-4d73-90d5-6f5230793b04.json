At the age of 34 the University of Bath swimmer is celebrating one of the most successful major championships of his long career and he emerged as the closest challenger to Ian Crocker, who took gold in world record time. The American touched in 22.71sec to beat the 22.74 set by Australia's Geoff Huegill, with Foster second in 23.22 and Croatia's Duje Draganja third in 23.26. The Australian Matt Welsh, who initially appeared to have taken the silver, was disqualified for travelling too far under water off the turn. \"I am delighted with the silver,\" said Foster. \"Realistically I knew it was always going to be about Ian Crocker and I thought he was in world record form, but I would have liked to have got closer. \"It takes my tally of medals won at international meets during my long career to 40 and I have to be happy with that.\" Britain will have further medal chances on the final day at the Conseco Fieldhouse, with Alison Sheppard contesting the 50m freestyle final after qualifying fourth fastest in 24.77 and James Hickman trying to make it an unprecedented five gold medals in a row in the 200m butterfly final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
