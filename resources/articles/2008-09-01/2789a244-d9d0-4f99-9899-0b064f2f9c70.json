The bombs, the first of which exploded at 6.15pm, all went off within 45 minutes of each other and were centred on three main areas. Television footage showed bloodstained streets and the shattered remains of nearby vehicles. In the immediate aftermath, police evacuated other big shopping centres and shut down large parts of the city's new Metro rail system. Cities in north India, including Delhi and Punjab's Chandigarh, were put on high alert. Responsibility for the attacks was claimed by Indian Mujahideen, a home-grown terrorist group with links to Pakistani radicals that first came to prominence in May, when it said it was behind a series of bombings in the western city of Jaipur, which killed 61 people. It also said it was behind blasts in July that claimed at least 45 lives in Ahmedabad, a major city in the western state of Gujarat. Television stations reported receiving an email from the group just before the blasts. It read: 'In the name of Allah, Indian Mujahideen strikes back once more... Do whatever you can. Stop us if you can.' It is believed that, as in the previous attacks, the devices were crude bombs filled with steel pellets. The bombs are believed to have been placed in dustbins in areas where the bombers knew many people would be present. The first bomb went off in Delhi's Karol Bagh, a wealthy western suburb, and blew up an auto-rickshaw. Seven people are believed to have died. That was followed by two more bombs - one in a newly built park above an underground train station and another opposite an office tower block in Connaught Place. 'Around 6.30pm, we heard a very loud noise, then we saw people running all over the place,' said Chanchal Kumar, whose shirt was soaked in the blood of victims he had helped take into ambulances. 'There were about 100 to 200 people around this place.' The last bombs are understood to have destroyed a hairdressing salon and a police box in Greater Kailash M Block market, a favourite spot for the city's middle classes. Police said that they had also defused two unexploded devices. At Greater Kailash market, the bomb went off in a bin in a busy shopping street opposite a Levi's store. Dharat Vhushan Rai, who was working in the store, said: 'A customer got a call on his mobile in the shop and said there had been bombs going off in the city. Within a few seconds of him ending the call there was a huge flash and a massive bang from outside. There was smoke everywhere. People were rushing here and there screaming. 'We went outside and there were a couple of people who were injured. Their hands and their heads were bleeding. The bomb had been placed in the dustbin. We were trying to get out of the market and then five minutes later it happened again. There was another explosion at the entrance to the market. People are afraid now.' Arti Mehra, New Delhi's mayor, told New Delhi television that the bombings were 'cowardly acts... [meant] to terrorise us'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
