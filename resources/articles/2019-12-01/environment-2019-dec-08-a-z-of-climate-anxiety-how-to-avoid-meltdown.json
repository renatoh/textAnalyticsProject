Mine came last summer, when a respected scientist told me matter-of-factly that he thought it was \u201cat least highly unlikely\u201d that his teenage children would survive beyond late middle age. At that point, three decades of climate unease crystallised into debilitating dread, and I\u2019m far from alone. \u201cThere are hundreds of people contacting us, looking for support,\u201d says Caroline Hickman of the Climate Psychology Alliance. It\u2019s not just individuals either. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a level where organisations are asking for professional help to support their staff: civil servants, museums, universities\u2026 They\u2019re noticing massive increases in anxiety and concern.\u201d Eco anxiety isn\u2019t pathological: it\u2019s a legitimate reaction to the climate crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s mentally healthy to feel this way,\u201d says Hickman. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of empathy.\u201d The real problem is how we manage our feelings. Biodiversity We know that global species extinction \u2013 already at a rate that is unprecedented over the past 10m years \u2013 is accelerating, but here\u2019s a chilling example: the UK has lost 97% of its hedgehog population since the 1950s. \u201cYou look at these horrific headlines about habitats and mass extinctions,\u201d says Emma Mitchell, author of The Wild Remedy: How Nature Mends Us. \u201cPeople say, \u2018What can we do, we feel completely powerless?\u2019 My answer is: we can do a great deal.\u201d If you have outside space, follow gardener and author Kate Bradbury\u2019s advice and plant native. \u201cNative plants have specific relationships with native moths, which lay their eggs on the leaves,\u201d she says. \u201cBirds then feed the caterpillars to their young, and hedgehogs, frogs, mice, wasps\u2026 pretty much everything eats caterpillars. So by planting native shrubs and trees you\u2019re creating a food chain in your garden and, literally, preventing further decline of species.\u201d Avoid peat-based compost: peat stores vast amounts of carbon and peat bogs are precious habitats for wildlife. If you don\u2019t already, support local campaigns to preserve habitat. An area of exceptional biodiversity near me is currently under threat, so I\u2019m signing petitions, protesting and sneaking it into articles (save Askham Bog!) . Incidentally, as Mitchell says, \u201cThere\u2019s research that shows that if the biodiversity in a green space is higher it has more of a positive impact on your mental health.\u201d Community The climate crisis is happening to all of us and experts agree the most effective responses to it are collective. Acting together helps us feel less powerless, but there are also real benefits to expressing our anxiety, anger or grief with others. \u201cMany people report that actually finding that they are not alone in this thinking, talking to other people about it, finding like-minded communities, is really powerful,\u201d says Dr Emma Lawrance, a fellow at Imperial College London\u2019s Institute of Global Health Innovation. In the US, the Good Grief Network hosts climate anxiety groups based loosely on the AA model, with a 10-step programme, from \u201cAccept the severity of the predicament\u201d to \u201cReinvest in meaningful effort.\u201d Denial Despite overwhelming evidence, truly terrifying institutional denial of the climate crisis continues. The Trump administration has blocked a congressional testimony warning about climate change, suppressed peer-reviewed government-funded studies on its effects, and fired a scientist who refused to alter reports to downplay its human causes. Worse, the administration likes to have its climate cake and eat it, denying the science while simultaneously pointing to the advanced state of ecological devastation as justification for not blocking fossil-fuel projects, whose incremental impact, they argue, would be negligible. Meanwhile, President \u201cCome back global warming, we need you\u201d Trump has confirmed the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement if he\u2019s re-elected. Energy For the UK, at least, you can downgrade your anxiety on this score: things are improving. This year we went two weeks without using coal to generate electricity, and in the last quarter, for the first time, renewables generated more energy than fossil fuels. Increased efficiency and an evolving economy mean demand for electricity is falling, too, so there is some good news. Fast fashion We need clothes, but the fashion industry is regularly rated as one of the world\u2019s worst polluters, with textiles producing an estimated 1.2bn tonnes of greenhouse gases per year. \u201cSolving the problems of fast fashion can often feel like that puzzle where you\u2019re trying to get a fox, a chicken and a bag of grain across the river. Just when you think you have an answer (Cotton! Clothes rental! H&amp;M!), someone pops up to tell you it\u2019s problematic,\u201d says Lauren Bravo, whose book, How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, is published soon. It\u2019s a funny, achievable guide to reducing our fabric footprint, and covers swapping, mending, washing less and, most importantly, resisting the urge to shop. Greta Does brilliant, furious Greta Thunberg make you feel uncomfortable? She should. She should be making TikToks or something, not crossing oceans to shout at the UN, or becoming a beacon of misplaced \u201chope\u201d for a generation too feeble to acknowledge its catastrophic failures. No wonder she makes a certain type of middle-aged person incandescently angry and many of the rest of us profoundly guilty. Hope \u201cIs there any good news?\u201d I text my father, sorrowfully. An ecologist who predicted a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of food, water and energy shortage within our lifetime 10 years ago, he\u2019s not inclined to boundless optimism. Nostra-dad-mus flagged the UN-REDD programme, which is making real progress in fighting deforestation worldwide. Ethiopia, too, planted 350m trees in one day in July this year. And a new ocean clean-up device has shown promise in collecting plastic in the Pacific. If that\u2019s not cheering enough, how about \u201cle blob\u201d, the self-healing, problem-solving, 720-sexed organism no one understands? New biodiversity! I for one welcome our new yellow overlord. Information The onslaught of information on extreme weather events, dire research findings and ecological catastrophes fuels our sense of panic and powerlessness, every forest fire or starving polar bear is a jolt of stress. \u201cObviously people want and need to be informed and understand the facts, and it\u2019s normal to feel strong emotions in response to those facts,\u201d says Dr Emma Lawrance of Imperial College. \u201cBut it\u2019s important when people are finding it too much that they feel like they are able to step back and take breaks.\u201d Decide how and when to engage with climate-crisis information and seek out good environmental news: it is out there. Jet anxiety Feel sick on planes and not because of turbulence? You\u2019re not alone. The Swedish concept of flygskam, flying shame, has gone mainstream, though we\u2019ve yet to assimilate the associated t\u00e5gskryt (train bragging) or find an equivalent for #jagstannarp\u00e5marken, meaning \u201cI stay on the ground.\u201d Flygskam works: the number of domestic Swedish flights dropped by 8% in the first four months of this year. I wonder if there\u2019s a Swedish term for \u201cpaying a fortune for a terrible service provided by amoral weasels\u201d? Probably not\u2026 lucky Swedes. Kids In her work as a research fellow at the University of Bath, Caroline Hickman frequently talks to children (and their worried parents) about climate anxiety. Her advice? Resist the natural impulse to try to protect them. \u201cChildren are online and finding out about this stuff. You need to learn how to take them towards painful things, show them how to navigate, but not to get overwhelmed and terrified.\u201d It\u2019s important to tell the truth, but balance it with positive messages and activities. As Hickman says, \u201cReminders to still play, even though we\u2019re dealing with painful things, are absolutely crucial.\u201d Loss The funeral that Iceland held for the Okjokull glacier this summer, after it was lost to climate change, was a pure expression of \u201csolastalgia\u201d, a term coined by philosopher Glenn Albrecht and defined as \u201cThe pain or sickness caused by the loss of, or inability to derive solace from, the present state of one\u2019s home environment.\u201d In parts of the world where the impact of climate change is physically unavoidable, loss and grief are the dominant emotions: we\u2019re lucky we\u2019re just anxious. Milk Ooh, tricky. Dairy is bad, but plant milks frequently mean destructive monocultures. Even oat milk, the current great off-white saviour, comes in hard-to-recycle Tetra Paks. Maybe just moisten your muesli with your own tears? No kids? Some view choosing not to have children as a positive act to reduce environmental impact: a Swedish study in 2017 estimated that having one fewer child per family can save an average of 58.6 tonnes of carbon every year. Others consider it unethical to bring children into a world whose future is so terrifyingly compromised. For many more, it\u2019s a fraught question. On its website, BirthStrikecollects testimony from those struggling with the issue: \u201cOver the past 10 years or so, all the accumulated knowledge around climate change and global warming has made me increasingly nervous to have children,\u201d says one. For eco-anxious parents, it\u2019s another source of guilt and worry: have we ruined the planet by having kids, or our kids by having them at such an awful time? Oceans We\u2019ve mistreated the ocean for decades and now it\u2019s coming for us: recent research has indicated that 300 million people (rather than the previous estimate of 80 million) are at risk from rising sea levels. The IPCC has also predicted that extreme events linked to sea level will be annual by 2050. Then there\u2019s acidification, plastics and bleaching of corals. How anyone still finds ocean sounds relaxing is beyond me: you might as well meditate to revving chainsaws. Paralysis That feeling of helplessness is a common response to catastrophic ecological news. I often stand in the supermarket overwhelmed: is all fish terrible? How about bananas? It feels as if there are no simple decisions now, but according to Imperial College\u2019s Grantham Institute, there are a few, actually. The Institute (which is working towards \u201ca sustainable, resilient, zero-carbon future\u201d) has published a list of 9 Things You Can Do About Climate Change. They are things \u201cabsolutely everybody can do that can make a difference,\u201d according to Institute co-director Martin Siegert. Some are covered here (eat less meat, preserve green spaces, avoid flying); others \u2013 invest your money wisely, use your voice \u2013 aren\u2019t. \u201cThey are relatively small steps,\u201d says Siegert. \u201cIf anything, they\u2019re going to improve your life.\u201d Quinoa Gluten-free, high in protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals, the nubbly South American grain soared in popularity in the health-conscious 2000s. Soon, reports emerged that its cultivation was bad for Andean farmers, then there were counter-claims that it wasn\u2019t. There now seems to be a consensus that its \u201csuper food\u201d status contributes to unsustainable farming techniques, meaning fewer llamas. Can we finally stop eating Satan\u2019s cereal? Llamas are great and we need some good news. Resilience \u201cBuilding resilience is essential to address the physical and mental health impacts of climate change,\u201d said the American Psychological Association in 2017. But how? Experts agree on broad strategies: acknowledge your feelings, take action in ways that feel meaningful, be part of a community and occasionally run around screaming until you\u2019re hoarse (OK, not the last bit). Single-use plastic It\u2019s terrible, but guess what? It\u2019s also complicated. An Environment Agency report concluded you\u2019d have to use your cotton tote 131 times to take its global warming potential below that of a plastic bag. Or what about cucumbers? 2011 research for the Journal of Food Science and Technology indicated plastic wrapping increases shelf life by six days, so what\u2019s more important: avoiding waste or eliminating plastic? Then there\u2019s the opacity and inconsistency of recycling policies. Recent BBC research found that 47% of people argue about what plastic can be recycled, which seems low \u2013 I know 100% of my household is sick of me uncovering their recycling transgressions and complaining about them. Tories The UK Committee on Climate Change\u2019s 2019 report on progress makes for dismal reading. The Government has implemented only one of the committee\u2019s 25 recommendations from 2018 and runs its climate crisis preparations \u201clike Dad\u2019s Army\u201d, according to committee chairman Lord Deben. The \u201cnet zero\u201d law promises to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and the fracking ban looks like good news (if it doesn\u2019t turn out to be a short-lived election stunt), but the CCC\u2019s prediction is that 2025 and 2030 targets will be missed by an even bigger margin than last year\u2019s. Urgency Greta said it: our house is on fire. But, of course, right now, your actual house isn\u2019t. It\u2019s quite chilly in mine and there\u2019s a blue tit pecking a fat ball outside. That\u2019s part of the problem: we \u2013 at least in the north \u2013 can ignore the climate crisis much of the time, which makes the eco-anxious feel like those chaps who march around wearing sandwich boards saying the end is nigh. Veganism Ah, veganism, the most emotive of dietary regimes\u2026 yes, worse than cannibalism. A recent Guardian investigation asked: \u201cWhy do people hate vegans?\u201d From Waitrose Food magazine editor William Sitwell\u2019s notorious \u201ckilling vegans\u201d email, to Piers Morgan\u2019s boggle-eyed outrage at the launch of Greggs\u2019s vegan sausage roll, there\u2019s a profound discomfort around vegans (they\u2019re better than us and we don\u2019t like it, basically), which often becomes open hostility. Plant-based eating isn\u2019t an environmental panacea, either. As the head of the Food Climate Research Network, Dr Tara Garnett, brilliantly summarised in a recent article for Brain Food magazine, recent concerns about intensive monocultures and highly processed vegan foods have led some eco-thinkers to conclude that \u201cVeganism is the vacuous entitled daughter of Big Food and Agribiz\u2026 Vegans are the problem.\u201d Should we be eating grass-fed beef and dumping facon and not-dogs? It\u2019s complicated, and many UK farmers are thoughtful stewards of native habitats and feel unfairly demonised. But eating fewer animal products is almost certainly a good thing. Wipes They\u2019re not strictly a climate issue, but wipes are unequivocally terrible, changing the shape of rivers and threatening marine wildlife. We use an energy-gobbling 11bn a year, but they\u2019re easy to avoid. Let\u2019s just not, eh? XR Extinction Rebellion has only existed since October 2018, but swiftly shook off its \u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d reputation, with a series of high-profile protests showcasing its transformation into a global campaigning force. October\u2019s UK fortnight of protest had moments of controversy (the Canning Town tube protest was widely considered a misstep), but it also showed that XR now attracts mass support, including from unexpected places: 77-year-old Rabbi Jeffrey Newman and 91-year-old John Lymes were arrested, and there are XR doctors, lawyers and farmers. Of course, that makes climate worriers who haven\u2019t become climate warriors feel even more guilty: why aren\u2019t we getting involved? Is it hypocritical to complain about government inaction from the comfort of our own homes? Almost certainly. Youth My teenage years were spent sulking to a Smiths sountrack and buying ra-ra skirts in Miss Selfridge (we didn\u2019t know about fast fashion then). Teenagers now don\u2019t have the luxury of solipsism: they\u2019re facing a world in crisis. A UK survey found 40% of 16-24-year-olds feel \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by climate change. For Jake Woodier of the UK Student Climate Network, the energy young people pour into activism is a product of the fear and anxiety they live with, from both the increasingly dire warnings in the media and from witnessing, \u201cThe destructive effects and consequences of climate breakdown suffered by their peers around the world.\u201d Taking action is an important outlet. \u201cI think that a lot of young people feel that they\u2019re suffering it alone,\u201d says Woodier. \u201cOrganising with a group and a movement gives quite a comforting sense, in a way.\u201d For the rest of us, it\u2019s a case of trying to understand what young people are going through and supporting them: and that means no muttering about not turning the lights out. We left the planetary lights on for decades; we\u2019re in no position to lecture them. Zero waste Zero waste is a seductive idea, but unsustainable unless you\u2019re an off-grid gardener-slash-engineer happy brushing your teeth with a twig. Limiting your food waste, however, is eminently achievable. Food and science writer Ann Storr turned her decades-long eco anxiety into an excellent, practical food waste blog, the Storr Cupboard. \u201cHalf of all the UK\u2019s food waste happens in the home,\u201d says Storr. (That\u2019s 7.1m tonnes a year, according to waste campaigners Wrap.) \u201cMeal planning is the best way to reduce your waste: 10 minutes spent meal planning so that you know what to buy and when to eat it will save you money and reduce your food waste.\u201d It\u2019s a small gesture; they all are. And that\u2019s OK, I think: for most of us, small change is all we have. \u201cThese most dire future scenarios are not set in stone,\u201d Emma Lawrance reminds me. \u201cThat means that even as the climate changes, at every step we can be looking at what world we want to create from that point. There\u2019s never a moment it\u2019s OK to give up; there are always steps to take towards the better trajectory.\u201d We can\u2019t save the world as individuals, but we can make it a tiny bit better; and perhaps save our sanity in the process."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
