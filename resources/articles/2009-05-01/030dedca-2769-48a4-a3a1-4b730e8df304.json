But the nine-to-five life wasn't for me. On graduating I got offered a job at a tug company in Venice, but I had already begun to dabble in rowing. Look at my office \u2013 it's filled with the most beautiful furniture in the world. We know where you live ... It's easy to tell where tourists are from. The British are polite but they never tip. Just one Cornetto ... Gondoliers do not sing. They row. Clients pay extra to have a maestro, usually accompanied by an accordion player, to come on board and sing. When someone starts singing \"Just one Cornetto\", we know they are British. People moan about ... The price (\u20ac80 for 40 minutes) but I think the hours justify our earnings \u2013 often in the summer season we work from 7am to midnight.

It's best to find a gondola station near an area you'd like to see up close. My favourite lunch spot is ... Trattoria da Chinellato, in Calle degli Albanesi, between the Danieli Palace jail from which Casanova escaped (part of the Doge's Palace). The service is efficient and friendly and there's a two-course set menu for \u20ac12. The most interesting person I've had on board ... I've made some lifelong friends, including a guy from Australia who taught me to surf, and a friend from England who returned with his family for Carnival. Last week his brother-in-law sailed into Venice on his own boat and invited my family on board for dinner. The best thing about my job is ...
