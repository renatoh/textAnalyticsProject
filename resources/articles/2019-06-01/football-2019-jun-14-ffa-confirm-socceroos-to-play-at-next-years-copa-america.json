It is the first time Australia will participate in the quadrennial South American tournament which, unlike the Asian Cup or European Championships, invites two teams from outside the continent. Qatar, winners of this year\u2019s Asian Cup and hosts of the 2022 World Cup, have also been invited and will join Graham Arnold\u2019s team at the month-long tournament in June and July next year. The Socceroos coach said the trip would serve as an integral part of the team\u2019s preparations ahead of the start of their World Cup qualification campaign, which starts earlier in June. \u201cThe Copa Am\u00e9rica is a highlight of the football calendar and we can\u2019t wait to get there,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cWe crave these opportunities as players and coaches. \u201cThe experience we will gain from playing in this tournament will be incredible and I know by speaking to our players, they are equally excited about being part of one of the world\u2019s most prestigious football tournaments. \u201cOur planning for the Fifa World Cup in Qatar has already started. We are building depth among our playing group, as evidenced by our performance in Korea Republic last week and playing in this tournament provides another layer of incentive for our players to put themselves up for selection for the national team.\u201d The 2020 tournament \u2013 which comes just 12 months after this year\u2019s 46th edition in Brazil, as it switches to an even-numbered yearly cycle \u2013 will feature some of the best sides in the world. The two invited nations are yet to be assigned a group, but Australia will either be drawn with Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, or with Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay and Chile. The top four teams from each six-strong group advance to the quarter-finals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
