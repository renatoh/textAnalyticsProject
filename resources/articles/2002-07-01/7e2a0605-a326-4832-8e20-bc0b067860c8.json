Ronaldo laughed like a naughty schoolboy when he was asked whether the feeling he had was better than sex. Then he recalled the anguish, personal and collective, after the final in Paris four years ago. \"I don't feel I have any debt to the Brazilian people and I don't feel I owe them anything after what happened in 1998,\" he said. \"Talking with Cafu and Roberto Carlos, we said that what we really missed out on then was the joy of winning and the happiness it would bring to Brazil. This is for them.\" Ronaldo went on to thank everyone he could think of, Oscars style. \"Having the World Cup in my hands now is a wonderful moment that before I could not even dream of. But this would never have happened were it not for my team-mates. There is nothing that can break the resolve of this group of players.\" Despite the emotion, however, the striker's ambitions are far from sated. \"Other goals will appear: I'm very ambitious,\" he warned. \"The Olympics is a great objective if they keep the rule to take three overage players. As for the sixth world title, we'll have to wait a little.\" And the sex question? \"Both are very hard to go without, but I don't think sex could ever be as rewarding as winning the World Cup. It's not that sex is not great; just that the World Cup is only every four years and sex is a lot more regular than that.\" Not all of Ronaldo's team-mates were so forthcoming. Instead they swept past the press, some like Juninho and Ronaldinho doing the samba, Denilson banging a drum. It was a good way to avoid being asked questions. Their manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari, is not so light on his feet, but even he managed to sidestep the issue of his future. Despite his success Scolari is expected to step down as Brazil's coach, seeking a position in Europe instead. Last night, however, he concentrated on the contribution of his only player with Premiership experience. \"The brightest thing we did was putting Juninho in the team,\" a beaming Scolari insisted. \"Our midfield is in perfect order and we have a forward line that will always get goals. I knew that formation would get us back the respect which perhaps we lost in the qualifying campaign. \"Brazil's fifth World Cup title is an historic moment,\" the coach added, \"one that no one will forget. I feel the kind of joy that the Brazilian people must be feeling now: the joy that we did our job. It has taken a long time and it has been hard, but we know we did this the right way. \"If you are a Brazilian footballer and you come second, you may as well be last. That's what I told the players. They had to play in order, and to be second was to be a loser. The people of Brazil will never forget the moment when we bring the cup back home.\" Germany's coach Rudi V\u00f6ller praised his players and insisted he would not resign, confirming he would coach his team through the 2004 European Championship campaign. \"When you lose a game the disappointment is great of course,\" V\u00f6ller said. \"But it is no shame to lose against a team like Brazil. Brazil deserved to win, although they had some difficulties against Turkey and us. Overall, however, they were the best team.\" V\u00f6ller attached no blame to his goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, despite his error for the first goal. \"We have to be happy with what we've achieved in this World Cup, particularly when you take into account how many injured players we've had during the the tournament. We played well at times and we owe a lot to Oliver Kahn, who did some fantastic things.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
