When is the battle over? We know that we are not there yet. That end is months, not weeks away. We know we have not yet reached the \u201cpeak\u201d but that it is coming. Like an invisible wave, we won\u2019t see it when it arrives, we will see only its effects. We have watched it wash over other countries: the grimly climbing toll reported daily, even hourly; the overwhelmed intensive care wards; the shuttered businesses and closed school gates; the empty streets and full mortuaries. \u201cThis health crisis and economic crisis is a battle on two fronts,\u201d the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has warned, \u201cand it is going to be waged in an unimaginable and unprecedented way over the next at least six months and potentially beyond that.\u201d But it is a balancing act for governments. Weighing lives against livelihoods, the financial imperative to restart shattered economies against the medical necessity to stay home and save lives. The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has promised her state\u2019s restrictions on work, gathering and movement would be assessed regularly, and flagged they could start to be eased as soon as next month. But it came with this blunt caveat: \u201cEvery time you relax a restriction, more people will get sick, more people will die.\u201d All over the world there is far to go, but restrictions are easing in China, where this Covid-19 outbreak began, and elsewhere planning is under way for a world beyond the pandemic. There will be \u2013 and have been already \u2013 massive economic, societal, environmental and ideological changes wrought by the virus. But right now, the medical questions remain fundamental: when do we know Covid-19 is sufficiently suppressed, how should the restrictions and the lockdowns be eased, and what does a post-Covid world look like? The risk of relaxing too early There is danger in complacency. Singapore, for weeks the darling of international comparison, the exemplar of how best to suppress the Covid-19 pandemic, has since seen a dramatic spike in the number of infections \u2013 a 60% jump in new daily infections \u2013 and has announced a further tightening of restrictions. It will now close all schools and most workplaces \u2013 only essential services such as supermarkets and banks will stay open \u2013 for a full month. It has instituted jail terms for breaching stay-at-home orders, and banned visitors and transits through the country. Comparisons between countries are always flawed, too great are the differences in size, development, governance and demographics. Singapore, an island city-state ruled by a single party since independence, with a high-quality public health system and a population broadly adherent to government diktat, was always inherently advantaged. Japan, similarly, having kept infections low for two months, has now declared a month-long state of emergency in response to a jump in new cases. But the risk of lifting restrictions too early and unleashing a devastating \u201csecond wave\u201d applies to countries all over the world, and the international community itself. \u201cIf Australia comes out of our isolation too early, we risk an even bigger peak,\u201d Associate Prof Ian Mackay from the University of Queensland told the Guardian this week. \u201cThis could take six months or more. We cannot lose focus. It\u2019s annoying, it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s very tough for a lot of people, there is real pain and economic hardship in the community. But we have to stick it out, because if we relax too soon, and allow the virus to re-emerge and spread widely, all the pain we have suffered will have been for nothing.\u201d There is historical precedent in Australia too. In the immediate aftermath of world war one, Australia was spared the very worst of the Spanish flu outbreak, aided by geography and the delay the steam-ship age afforded a distant continent to implement a strict quarantine regime. But when the flu did break in Australia, it killed an estimated 17,000 people, and it did so in three waves, the first in February, the second in April. The third wave, in July, was by far the most deadly. \u2018What\u2019, not \u2018when\u2019 There is an argument that asking \u201cwhen\u201d the restrictions will be lifted is the wrong question. The question that needs to be asked is \u201cwhat?\u201d. What needs to be in place, what needs to have been achieved, before restrictions can be lifted? Scott Gottlieb, a former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner, co-authored a paper with the American Enterprise Institute, proposing a four-phase \u201croad map to re-opening\u201d. The first phase \u2013 in which Australia firmly remains \u2013 is to suppress the spread of the virus as quickly and as comprehensively as possible, to stop the \u201ccurve\u201d from rising to an unmanageable peak that overwhelms public health systems. If there are more critically ill people than there are hospital beds, people who could have been saved will die. This suppression involves physical distancing measures, banning gatherings, closing public spaces and potentially schools, having people work from home, and limiting all travel. In the second phase, individual states, or even cities, would be able to gradually ease certain restrictions, but only when they have built up their capacity to identify, test and isolate most confirmed Covid-19 contacts and their close contacts. The third phase would allow for remaining restrictions to be lifted when a vaccine is developed, an effective therapy is widely available, or when testing data shows widespread immunity. But there is a fourth stage too. When this pandemic is over \u2013 and it will end \u2013 governments must learn its lessons, and invest heavily in medical research and public health systems. They must prepare for the next one. A phased recovery Dr Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales\u2019s Kirby Institute, has argued for Australia to impose a \u201cshort, sharp lockdown \u2026 followed by a phased lifting of restrictions\u201d. \u201cA short, sharp lockdown of four to eight weeks will improve control of the epidemic in Australia, reduce case numbers more rapidly and bring us to a more manageable baseline from which phased lifting of restrictions and economic recovery can occur. If we fail to do this, we face continued epidemic growth, potential failure of the health system, and a far longer road to recovery.\u201d Michael J Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization\u2019s health emergencies program, told policymakers each country needs to determine an individual \u201ccalibrated, step-wise approach\u201d to easing restrictions on movement, travel and work. He said countries need to have come off the \u201cpeak\u201d of infections and have capacity in their healthcare systems \u2013 spare beds in hospitals \u2013 as well as good data on infections, and a low positivity rate, which is the proportion of all samples tested that return positive. \u201cYou\u2019ll see in somewhere like [South] Korea, they\u2019re testing, and 2% to 6% of their samples are positive. Last week in New York 37% of tested samples were positive. So you need to carefully look at what proportion of people that are tested are positive.\u201d But Ryan stressed that \u201cthere are no absolutes here, there are no answers\u201d. A phased lifting of restrictions appears to be Australia\u2019s likely strategy \u2013 \u201csteps and stages that we can test and reverse\u201d, the health minister, Greg Hunt, says. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, led by the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, is working on an \u2018exit strategy\u2019 to be presented to government. But Morrison has already forecast a staggered recovery \u2013 a gradual easing of particular restrictions, in certain places, always with the caveat that they may need to be re-imposed if infections again start to rise. \u201cYou will have some jurisdictions, some states and territories, that might be in a position to move when others are not, then we will learn from the experience of those states that may have trialled things.\u201d Tasmania, with fewer cases, and the geographic advantage of being a small island with firmly established biosecurity laws, may be able to move sooner than other states. Those areas hardest hit by Covid-19 cases \u2013 New South Wales, Victoria and south-east Queensland \u2013 are likely to be the last to be able to move. South Australia, with a relatively low number of infections, few hospitalisations, and the highest per capita testing rate in the country, could also be an early mover. Prof Lyn Gilbert, the chair of the Infection Prevention and Control Expert Advisory Group that reports to the nation\u2019s chief health officers, has warned restrictions could wax and wane with the rate of infections. \u201cEveryone wants to know when it will end, and I know the politicians are desperate to be able to say when it will end, but I think we\u2019ve got to be cautious,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the only way to do it properly is to watch what\u2019s happening and calibrate the response according to what\u2019s happening. And if restrictions were lifted, at least partly, and the numbers started to go up again, they\u2019d probably have to be reimposed.\u201d Governments across the country are bracing their populations for a \u201cmarathon not a sprint\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you when this is going to end,\u201d the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said this week. \u201cIt is not going to be over in weeks, it is going to be months and months.\u201d There is shrewd political positioning that overlays the medical advice informing this position: better to tell a population to prepare for six months of pain and proscription, and be able to lift it early, than to promise a rapid solution and find yourself apologising, and explaining why it must be extended again. And Morrison has repeatedly stressed there is no plan yet to ease restrictions anywhere. \u201cThere is no map for this. We are in uncharted territory.\u201d The Chinese experience Wuhan, the original centre of the virus, has begun to lift the restrictions on movement after 76 days of near-total lockdown. Movement is now allowed out of the city to the wider Hubei province and beyond. At its peak, Wuhan\u2019s lockdown was extreme: images of doors being welded shut to lock people in their homes shocked the world. Authoritarian regimes are less concerned about curtailing their citizens\u2019 civil liberties and human rights. Liberal democracies find such measures harder to implement: their populations will not tolerate such extreme impositions. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to go and cut and paste measures from other places, which have completely different societies. I mean, in China they were welding people\u2019s doors shut,\u201d Morrison told reporters bluntly. \u201cThat might be OK with them, but \u2026 we have different ways of doing things in Australia.\u201d China has been condemned, queried and praised for its response to Covid-19: lauded for its swift and effective lockdown measures; questioned over the veracity of its infection reporting and suppression of information; and excoriated for its failure to adequately warn the world in the initial stages of outbreak and silencing doctors who tried to raise the alarm. But, even as restrictions ease across the world\u2019s most populous nation, freedom there post-Covid is scarcely unrestrained. China\u2019s Health Code app has been downloaded by 700 million people. It is mandatory in some Covid-19-affected areas, such as Wuhan, for even the most fundamental freedoms \u2013 to enter a supermarket, catch a taxi, ride the subway or see a doctor. Users must first fill in their personal details, including their national ID number, where they live and whether they have been in contact with confirmed cases of the virus. The app then gives them a colour-coded rating: green means they are free to travel; yellow mandates seven days quarantine, and red requires 14 days. The app also quietly collects \u2013 and shares with police \u2013 a user\u2019s location and travel data. The \u201cfreedom\u201d provided by this technological development has not been universally welcomed. \u201cI thought the days when humans are ruled by machines and algorithms won\u2019t happen for at least another 50 years, one blogger on Zhihu wrote. \u201cThis coronavirus epidemic has suddenly brought it on early.\u201d Human Rights Watch described the Health Code app as \u201cautomated tyranny\u201d. Digital contact tracing Singapore has also used technology to surveil its citizens, pulling together a database of personal details to allow health authorities to track potential Covid-19 carriers. The TraceTogether app sends bluetooth signals to other users, and sends messages to phones warning that a person may have come into contact with a known or suspected case. South Korea\u2019s mass testing regime and radical transparency have suppressed Covid-19 infections, but at the price of civil liberties. Granular details of new infections and their whereabouts are routinely made public, leading to doxxing of suspected cases \u2013 even speculation of alleged illicit affairs \u2013 and leading the country\u2019s National Human Rights Commission to warn that people infected by the coronavirus face a potential second trauma of harassment, ridicule and social stigma. Israel, Taiwan and Iran have also used mobile phone data to trace potential Covid-19 contacts and monitor its citizens\u2019 movements. The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) has called for a pan-European mobile app to track the spread of Covid-19 instead of the current miscellany of apps used across the EU that risk breaching people\u2019s privacy. Immunity certificates In Britain, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the UK would consider \u201cimmunity certificates\u201d for its population \u2013 medical recognition that a person has had Covid-19 and recovered, and can\u2019t catch it again or spread it. Determined through a serology test for coronavirus antibodies in an individual\u2019s blood, an immunity certificate would authorise a person to return to work and re-enter the community. \u201cWe are looking at an immunity certificate,\u201d Hancock said, \u201chow people who have had the disease, have got the antibodies and therefore have immunity can ... get back as much as possible to normal life.\u201d In Germany too, one of the first countries in Europe to begin to ease restrictions, researchers are preparing a large-scale study into immunity to Covid-19, with a hope it could allow authorities to issue passes to exempt workers from restrictive lockdown measures. Such a certificate could be particularly effective in getting healthcare workers \u2013 disproportionately affected by the virus \u2013 back to work more quickly when they are no longer sick, and no longer at risk of spreading the virus. Denmark has also flagged lifting some of its restrictions, forecasting \u201ca gradual and controlled opening of society starting mid-April\u201d. Part of Denmark\u2019s plan is to offer widespread testing, not only for the virus, but also for antibodies \u2013 to determine who has immunity, and how widespread immunity is across the community. There are questions, however, over the reliability of serology testing, and whether the presence of antibodies provides long-term immunity. And there are potential risks. Immunity certificates could create a two-tiered society of those with antibodies and a measure of immunity who are allowed out, and those without who must remain isolated. They could also create a perverse incentive to catch the virus, particularly among demographics for whom the illness is likely \u2013 though not certain \u2013 to be mild. The certificates, too, have the potential to act as a reward to people who have not adhered to physical distancing and who have developed immunity but at the risk to others\u2019 health. We are not alone In the chaos of the coronavirus, the nation-state has reasserted its dominance in the global order. Country is king. The virus has spread quickly because of the modern world\u2019s breath-taking interconnectivity. But the reaction to this rapid global spread has been its antithesis: national governments and their people have turned inwards, closed borders, told foreign nationals to leave, and relied on national leaders and institutions for guidance through the crisis. Countries have formulated and run their responses on strictly national lines. Each country\u2019s \u201ccurve\u201d is compared with others as to whose measures are best (despite the inherent flaws in such comparisons). The national fight is all that most people have the energy for, the looming global calamity is almost beyond contemplation. But the international pandemic must be Australia\u2019s, must be every country\u2019s, concern. Covid-19 is no respecter of national borders. Its virulent spread across the world is evidence that the problem is a global one, and so its solutions must be too. It can only be defeated collectively. \u201cFortress Australia\u201d might work temporarily \u2013 and Australia has the inherent advantage of being a large island nation-state with borders it can lock down \u2013 but it is not sustainable for a country so dependent upon exports and imports, and a people who travel. Other countries, many in Australia\u2019s region, face a far more challenging battle than Australia does. The virus carries the potential of immense suffering. Many nations in the Asia-Pacific are densely populated, with developing economies and healthcare systems ill-prepared for the Covid-19 wave to wash over them. The physical distancing enforced by countries around the world, in reality, is a privilege of the rich. Developing nations face the far grimmer choices in choosing to lock its populations down to keep them alive or allowing them to work in order to survive. Hundreds of millions of daily wage labourers in India \u2013 a country under total lockdown \u2013 don\u2019t eat if they don\u2019t work. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has warned his country cannot enact the distancing measures it needs to without people starving. There are other challenges too. Indonesia, late to the fight against Covid-19, now finds itself battling the virus blind, because it doesn\u2019t have adequate testing. And Pacific nations are braced for the potential devastation of a virus sweeping through small close-knit communities, isolated from tertiary health care. Vanuatu, already on high alert for a Covid-19 outbreak, bore the brunt of yet another category 5 cyclone this week, a reminder that climate-influenced catastrophes remain ever-present in Australia\u2019s region. Humanity\u2019s other grave challenges have not been eradicated, only momentarily obscured, by the Covid-19 crisis. Even if Australia succeeds in bending its Covid-19 infection curve to its will \u2013 which is at this point unusual for an Anglophone country \u2013 there will be more to do internationally before restrictions such as travel bans can be lifted. Australia\u2019s success in defeating Covid-19 will depend on its willingness to help other countries less able to defeat it too. You can never be safe from a virus if you are surrounded by it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
