Eight tries were enough to breeze past the challenge of Georgia in Dublin with a 63-14 victory that finally confirms their participation in next autumn's jamboree. Denis Hickie set Ireland on their way as early as in the 106th second, when he rounded off a fine move for Ireland's first try. More quickly followed from Kevin Maggs, Brian O'Driscoll twice and Girvan Dempsey. Ronan O'Gara's boot did the rest to bring up a 42-0 lead at half-time. Simon Easterby went over in the second half, before Georgia replied with tries from Vassil Katsadze and Bessik Khamashuridze. But Alan Quinlan and Guy East erby restored order with late tries for Ireland. Saracens owner Nigel Wray has launched a broadside at the 'shambles' that is domestic rugby. Writing in yesterday's matchday programme at Saracens, he complained: 'Club and country still try and play at the same time with the same players, and people still wonder why there are permanent arguments. We limp from competition to competition, and nothing is ever allowed to move to its climax before the set is switched.' He condemns both the RFU and the IRB for their insensitivity, routinely organising games that cannot be fitted into the schedule. 'Not very surprising really because bureaucracy is like government - they actually don't represent their constituents, they represent themselves.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
