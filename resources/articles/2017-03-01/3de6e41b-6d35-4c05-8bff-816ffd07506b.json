Do keep up!", "bodyText": "Catch up on the episode two recap here Dear me, this is not a good advert for coastal living, or 50th birthday parties, or male friends of any kind. \u201cHow many men were at your party?\u201d \u201cToo many.\u201d Quite. The net widened. The plot thickened. And Taxi Man appeared to incriminate himself on multiple levels \u2013 while being way too obvious a suspect at this stage. We wouldn\u2019t expect things to be clarified to any major degree by this point, so it\u2019s fair to say that the story moved at the pace it should tonight without anything major happening. Gripping is not the word, but it was compelling enough. Humour was jettisoned (apart from a fleeting Scotch egg moment) for suspense. The list of suspects grew to ridiculous proportions and Trish continued to receive anonymous communications which bloomed creepily from text messages to flowers. A few things grated. Why no more investigations into what Trish did in the time between the rape and reporting it? Have they forgotten about this? Why is no one asking why Cath has so few women friends? Why has no one noticed that most of the suspects have beards and that this might jog Trish\u2019s memory? (I know, I know. I am wasted in this job.) Trish\u2019s beachside stroll with Cath was the most revelatory moment here. She genuinely can\u2019t remember who her attacker is. (Previously, I felt this was ambiguous.) And the \u201cswinging\u201d idea seems to have collapsed too, as the musician and the man from the farm shop would have mentioned those goings on. We still don\u2019t know who Trish is protecting, though. Who was at her house on the Saturday morning? (My money is on Ed Burnett.) And how much longer can she hold out against Miller and Hardy? \u201cYou know how it feels to be violated and feel like it\u2019s your fault?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how that feels. No.\u201d It feels like deja vu that Miller\u2019s porn-loving son and the Latimers constitute the main sub-plots. The two stories reached their inevitable crossover as Trish identified Beth thanks to the wonders of Google. Plus, there\u2019s another crossover with Miller\u2019s son being best friends with Taxi Man\u2019s stepson. (Do keep up.) How many red herrings will pile up before we, the audience, feel too manipulated? Let\u2019s wait and see. I have a feeling the discrepancies in Taxi Man\u2019s stories will be ironed out next week and he will turn out to be guilty of some other crime. \u201cWhy are you lying to us, Lucas? We called all these people and you didn\u2019t take any of them.\u201d The coldness of \u201cAre you married, Lucas?\u201d was magical. The scene with his wife was a bit strange, though. Lucas/Clive does not seem the type to have a medical degree. And his wife suggested he hasn\u2019t given up his ambitions? From what we have seen, I doubt he could write a prescription. I worried about some of the police procedure too. Can it be productive to track condom purchases? Would Hardy be so rude to Harford when they\u2019re all working overtime? Would Miller really consider accepting Deli Man\u2019s offer of free food? Too many questions. We had better start getting a hint of some answers next week. Miller v Hardy: the score so far Miller, Scotch egg in her gob, won this episode hands down. She\u2019s in control of everything (except for her son\u2019s phone). Hardy, meanwhile, is starting to lose it. \u201cWhy did you come back here?\u201d Ah, so now we come to it. \u201cThe place I thought was home wasn\u2019t any more.\u201d This should be an important emerging theme. What has Hardy got to prove? \u201cI know you\u2019re tired. I know you want a result. But you\u2019ve got to go easier.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m scared he\u2019s going to do it again. That\u2019s why I\u2019m pushing.\u201d \u201cDaisy\u2019s dad\u201d is under pressure. Now we need to see him crack to move things forward ... Miller 28, Hardy 0. Not the usual suspects \u201cIt feels like the more we interview, the more we rule in.\u201d Tell us about it, Miller! There really can be no man left in Christendom, let alone Broadchurch, who is not a suspect. There\u2019s enough to fill an actual entire wall. Thanks, Harford. The two main suspects (the ex-husband and Cath\u2019s husband Jim) came face-to-face at Atwood\u2019s Autos. \u201cI think I might be in the shit ... I made it all up ... You can tell them what I\u2019m like when I drink tequila ... My wife has been raped and I don\u2019t know where I was.\u201d Blimey. Does the ex-husband\u2019s standing-outside-the-house phone call let him off the hook? He surely can\u2019t be the one who sent the text message? And yet he also has secrets on his computer? He appeared to be exonerated for a moment and then suddenly wasn\u2019t. I predict that he is dodgy but for other reasons entirely. Jim Atwood\u2019s story seemed to stack up with Ed Burnett\u2019s account of their fight. \u201cI hope someone\u2019s said to you that she wouldn\u2019t do anything to provoke this. She is not that sort of woman.\u201d Then Cath\u2019s comment seemed to indicate that Ed was lying about when he left \u2013 and she suspects her husband of lying too. \u201cDid I rape one of our best friends? I really need to answer that?\u201d And then came more suspects, as if we needed them. Deli Man (\u201cfrom the farm shop\u201d) and his walk around the lake. The old buffer from the stately home talking about the old waterfall under the tree. And the musician as well, except he immediately incriminated Deli Man, Suspect No 487. \u201cThat bloke from the farm shop looked like he wanted to kill someone.\u201d How exhausting. Life lesson Don\u2019t say you\u2019ve driven people home when you didn\u2019t because they will be able to tell the police that you didn\u2019t. It\u2019s fairly basic. Trademark Wessex words of wisdom \u201cWe are probably going to retrieve his DNA from your bedsheets anyway.\u201d Hardy appears to have ditched the whole be-sensitive-to-the-rape-victim thing. \u201cAre you really going to drink that disgusting stewed tea?\u201d Hardy and his microwaved tea. Eugh. No wonder he is in such a foul mood. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like me, does he?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not about you.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, Harford. He doesn\u2019t like anyone. \u201cI\u2019m sleeping in my daughter\u2019s box room while she works herself to death. It\u2019s the retirement I always dreamed of.\u201d More from Miller\u2019s dad please."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
