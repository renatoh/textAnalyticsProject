The man, whose name has not been released, will appear before magistrates in Nuneaton today charged with the murder of Trevor Morse, 48, the force said in a brief statement. Two men were arrested after Morse, who was following the Warwickshire Hunt at the time, was killed in the incident at Long Marston airfield near Stratford on Avon on Monday afternoon. He was pronounced dead at the scene after suffering severe head injuries. A second man, whose name has also not been released, was freed on police bail. Sam Butler, joint master of the Warwickshire hunt, said following Morse's death that he was a regular hunt follower. \"He was a true countryman and I can give no higher compliment.\" Long Marston was built as an RAF training base during the second world war, becoming private in the 1950s. It is now mainly used by microlights and light aircraft, and in recent years has hosted rock music events, most notably the Phoenix festival, in the 1990s. Gyrocopters fly using a combination of a rear-mounted engine-driven for thrust and a top propeller, which rotates through wind resistance and allows them far greater manoeuvrability than a fixed-wing aircraft."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
