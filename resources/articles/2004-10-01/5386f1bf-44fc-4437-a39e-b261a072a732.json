The baby was \"a fighter\" and he believed everything should be done for her, even though she would be disabled. \"At the end of the day, she is our daughter,\" said Mr Wyatt, 33. His wife, Debbie, 23, has decided not to give evidence, but was in court to hear her husband say he believed in miracles. \"If the man upstairs says this person should live, then this person should live,\" he said. The judge was hearing a plea by Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust for a declaration allowing doctors not to put the baby on a ventilator in the event of a future breathing crisis and to allow her to die. The Wyatts will learn on Thursday, when he delivers judgment, whether their arguments prevailed. But the balance tipped against them yesterday when Cafcass, the Children and Family Courts Advisory and Support Service, representing the baby's interests, told the judge it did not believe going on a ventilator again would be in her best interests. She has been ventilated five times for breathing difficulties, and her lungs are scarred. Putting her on one again would probably give her only a few extra months, it emerged at the hearing. And doctors say her life is measured in months rather than years. They say she is bound to catch a virus that will prove fatal within months. It also emerged yesterday that her parents realised only in this week's hearing how profoundly brain-damaged she is. They had lost trust in doctors because they were told several times that the baby would die, yet she continued to survive. Doctors say she will never see or hear, walk, sit or eat properly, and will require round-the clock care until she dies. Even the two who gave expert evidence for the parents said that, in their medical opinion, further ventilation would be futile. Dr G, a consultant in paediatric intensive care, told the court that since parents and doctors disagreed, the baby might be given a tracheostomy - an incision in the windpipe that would make ventilation easier. Then, if the need arose, she could be ventilated. Meanwhile the parents could consider signing a contract agreeing that if a period such as five days on the ventilator gave no improvement, the baby could be given tender loving care and allowed to die. She was born three months premature at St Mary's hospital in Portsmouth, in October weighing one pound and measuring five inches. She has never left hospital and has stopped breathing five times. She is fed by tube because she cannot suck from a bottle, and needs a constant supply of oxygen. Mr Wyatt, of Buckland in Portsmouth, told the judge: \"You grow to love a child.\" He conceded that, if the time came when she was really suffering, he would change his mind. \"But I believe there are things in medical science to help her carry on, even for a couple of years, and she can even go outside and see the trees and whatever,\" he said. It was obvious, when he and his wife were holding their daughter, that \"she doesn't want to go\". Mr Wyatt said doctors should perform a tracheostomy so long as she did not suffer. If, after five days or so, she continued to deteriorate and reached a \"no no\" situation, then she could be handed back to \"TLC\". He told the court: \"Then we would just be there, comforting her and holding her for her last moments and we would let her go, and then, that's it. But at the moment she is not at that stage.\" Mr Wyatt said that recently he held the baby for 10 minutes, and then his wife held her, \"and you could see the amount of comfort she got from that - we put her in her cot and she fell asleep\". Mrs Wyatt was in tears as her husband told the judge: \"I held Charlotte's hand and she gripped my finger. She knows who we are, and that we are her parents.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
