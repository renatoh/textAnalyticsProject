The Churchill Archive Trust has agreed a deal with publisher Bloomsbury to make available more than 1m items. These include about 2,500 archive boxes of letters, telegrams, documents and photographs that are stored in Cambridge and currently viewable only by appointment. Churchill's papers were, controversially at the time, bought for the nation from his heirs in 1995 using \u00a312m of lottery money. They are currently stored at the Churchill Archives Centre (CAC). After years of cataloguing and transferring them to microfilm, the next logical step was making the archives available to everyone \u2013 although not for free, said CAC's director Allen Packwood. \"It's tremendously exciting for us, as it is fulfilling what the trust was established to do in the first place,\" he said. \"It will take the whole Churchill collection to a worldwide audience.\" Packwood said people would have the opportunity to see an enormous array of historical material without the layers of interpretation that had been added over the years. \"It is an opportunity for people to make their own judgments,\" he said. \"You'll be able to see what was on Churchill's desk on a day-to-day basis and how he responded to it. You'll be able to compare easily what he was saying in public at the same time as what he was saying privately.\" The CAC said the only way of digitising the archive and making it widely available was by finding a commercial partner, since there was no prospect of gaining public funds. \"We don't have the money or, crucially, the expertise,\" said Packwood. When the archive goes live in 2012, organisations and individuals will have to pay to access them. Exact figures have yet to be confirmed, but Frances Pinter, the publisher of Bloomsbury Academic, said they would keep the price low to ensure a wide reach. \"We will make it affordable as possible,\" she added. Bloomsbury won the contract after a bidding process and Pinter said the database would be created in a way that researchers could find historical needles in haystacks. \"As an archival collection, there's nothing like this. The nearest comparison would be something like the presidential archives in America and they are not as digitally advanced as we will be.\" The archive is packed full of letters, photographs and ephemera covering Churchill's life from his school days; his time as a soldier during the Boer war; his spell as a rising political star in Edwardian England; the isolation of the 1930s and the war itself, before his final years as an elder statesman during the cold war. Much of it covers international affairs and there are drafts of some of his most famous speeches such as, \"never in the field of human conflict\" and \"fight on the beaches\" \u2013 both widely reported, but not recorded until after the war. There is also more personal material that shines a light on his lifelong love of gambling and drinking, including a bet with Lord Rothermere that he could refrain from \"brandy or undiluted spirits\" for a year. Packwood wants new generations to learn about Churchill and his place in history. He also hopes it may put right many of the myths about Churchill and his family. There are some 1m pages of material in the Churchill archives, amounting to about 2,500 archival boxes of letters, telegrams, manuscripts, photographs and other ephemera. The archives include: \u2022 Annotated drafts of some of his most famous speeches, including two commonly thought to have been broadcast: the \"fight them on the beaches\" speech, on 4 June 1940, and the \"never in the field of human conflict\" speech, on 20 August 1940. Both were, in fact, delivered in the House of Commons, although he did record them after the war. \u2022 Items relating to Churchill's menagerie of pets, including his black geese, sheep and pigs at Chartwell; his cat, Nelson; his dogs, Rufus I and Rufus II; and his budgie Toby. \u2022 Material about the testing of cigars, reflecting MI5's concern that Churchill could be offered an exploding or poisonous cigar. \u2022 Churchill was also something of a hack journalist, supplementing his political income with popular articles such as \"Can we breed a race of supermen?\", and \"Are there men on the moon?\" In 1931, after an unhappy experience on New York's Fifth Avenue, he wrote about what it was like to be hit by a motorcar. \u2022 When he took up painting, Churchill decided he needed advice from the best, so there is correspondence with Walter Sickert and Sir John Lavery. There are also letters from George Bernard Shaw, TE Lawrence.and Vivien Leigh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
