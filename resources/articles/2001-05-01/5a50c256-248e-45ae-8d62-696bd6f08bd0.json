The Observer has learnt that the Republic's Director of Public Prosecutions will recommend that charges are made against Terence Mulholland, the driver of a truck which collided with a car Fitzsimons was travelling in on the N7 Dublin to Limerick road last year. The DPP's recommendation follows a six-month Garda investigation into the crash on 22 November 2000. The truck involved in the horrific accident belonged to the Woodside Haulage firm in Ballyclare, Co Antrim. Fitzsimons was killed almost instantly in the collision at Borris-an-Ossisory in Co Laoise. The 29-year-old Northern Ireland-born RTE star presented Network 2's youth music programme No Disco. A native of Ardglass, Co Down, Fitzsimons started her career training with Across the Line presenter Mike Edgar at BBC Northern Ireland Youth Programmes. She completed a communications degree at Dublin City University. In August 1998 she compered the Slane rock festival - the first for three years - which attracted more than 70,000 people. Among the artists she introduced were Robbie Williams, The Verve, Manic Street Preachers and James. At the time of the festival, Fitzsimons said: 'I'm really excited - the last time I was at Slane it was to see REM and Oasis in 1995 and I never once thought that I'd be back as the compere.' After her death last November the presenter's former school principal paid tribute to her famous pupil. 'There is a tremendous sense of sadness and loss that a vital young person who had so much to give to the world and was a great model for other young people has been taken from this life so tragically,' said Sheila Crea, from Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
