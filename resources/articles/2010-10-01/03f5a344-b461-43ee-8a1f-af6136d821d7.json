She alternately charmed and terrorised government ministers, civil servants and fellow commissioners on the issues she held dear. Supreme among these was the wellbeing of patients. Claire never let anyone forget that the purpose of a nursing and midwifery strategy is not professional aggrandisement, but the improvement of health and healthcare. Seven months on, the government has not responded in detail to the commission's 20 forward-thinking recommendations. It says they should be adopted locally. But supporting frontline staff and ensuring that nurses and midwives have a strong voice in decision-making are too important to be left to the vagaries of local health politics. Implementing the commission's recommendations \u2013 with a strong lead from the centre as well as locally \u2013 would be a fine memorial to this remarkable campaigner, as well as an important safeguard for patient care amid the turmoil now facing the NHS. Jane Salvage Visiting professor, Florence Nightingale School of Nursing &amp; Midwifery, King's College London \u2022 RIP Claire Rayner. Now with wings.
