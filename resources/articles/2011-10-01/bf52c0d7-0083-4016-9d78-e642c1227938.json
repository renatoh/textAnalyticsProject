The child, a girl, had been expected for a fortnight, and was born at the La Muette private clinic in the chic 16th arrondissement of Paris. President Nicolas Sarkozy was reported to have flown back from Germany, where he was having urgent talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel about saving the euro, to see his newborn daughter. According to French reports she was born around 7.30pm on Wednesday evening. No further details were released. It is first child to be born to a serving French president. Europe 1 radio said Bruni-Sarkozy, 43, was doing well after the birth. It is her second child \u2013 she has a son from an earlier relationship \u2013 while Sarkozy, 57, has three boys from two previous marriages. The birth will come as a relief to long-suffering residents around La Muette in the upmarket 16th arrondissement of Paris. Police sealed off the roads around the clinic at the beginning of the month and security has been tight ever since. As the days passed speculation turned feverish, not to mention fantastic, with false alerts including Twitter reports that the baby had already been born, and was a boy named Vadim. \"It's been a fortnight that the area has been packed with police officers and paparazzi,\" one local complained. Bruni-Sarkozy will also be pleased to finally given birth, given her recent confession that she was bored by pregnancy and anxious to \"get it over with\" so she could have a drink and a cigarette. Seven months from a presidential vote in which he is expected to seek re-election, Sarkozy needs a boost to his popularity. An opinion poll published a few hours before his wife apparently went into labour revealed he was on course for a trouncing next May at the hands of the Socialist party's newly elected candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. However, Bruni-Sarkozy has insisted the baby will be kept out of the spotlight and St\u00e9phane Roz\u00e8s, a former opinion poll director who now runs the French consultancy agency CAP, says Sarkozy would be advised not to use the child to drum up votes. \"The baby will not play at all in Sarkozy's favour,\" he warned. \"The French have a very distinct view about the personal and the political and they don't like the two to be confused. Sarkozy did this at the beginning of his mandate and it didn't go down well.\" Roz\u00e8s says the French believe their leaders must rise above personal matters and personify the role of president. \"In the French imagination the president must rise above the temporal and incarnate the spiritual. He must carry out this role above and beyond personal matters. Making a big show of personal and private matters is seen as degrading that position. The French don't like that at all.\" Carine Marc\u00e9 of pollsters TNS-Sofres agreed. \"In our research the French have told us that it [the baby] won't change anything. Of course there may be a small effect but If Carla respects what she has said about no photos, it won't amount to much.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
