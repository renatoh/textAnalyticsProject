His business interests include care homes, hotels, leisure facilities and student accommodation and he has been listed as a director 137 times with Companies House. Woodhouse began his business career as a teenager cleaning cars. \u201cI was always a clever little git that thought he knew something that they didn\u2019t, and one day somebody said: \u2018Put up or shut up\u2019 and I sort of thought I\u2019d better put my money where my mouth is,\u201d he says. \u201cMy first experience as an entrepreneur was maybe working within the car industry and just seeing that cars needed cleaning. It was just a simple supply and demand. Then I sort of realised that people would want to come and part exchange their cars with us \u2013 often the traders wouldn\u2019t give them the best possible prices, so I then thought actually if I offered to sell your car for you from a location and get you more than you were being offered and yet I\u2019d be able to make something off the top of that. That was my first experience of cleaning cars and selling cars was probably my first experience at a young age.\u201d His personal website reports how the business \u201cwas such a success that within two years he had helped create a multimillion-pound financial facility for the funding of vehicles to large independent financial advisory and accountancy groups across the globe\u201d. Woodhouse then moved into property development and raising funds to build care homes, buy hotels and \u2013 eventually \u2013 build the Afan Valley adventure resort. His website also describes him as a \u201cbusiness mentor\u201d and the advice on offer includes: five lessons you can learn from failure; how to optimise your decision making; simple strategies for overcoming procrastination; and how to improve your personal brand. His career has allowed him to enjoy many of the trappings of a successful entrepreneur. He lives in a 17th-century country house, which estate agents have described as a \u201cmagnificent Grade I-listed six-bedroom country residence with staff quarters \u2026 Over the years this has been home to eminent local businessmen and visited by prime ministers and dignitar[ies] \u2026 The hall stands in manicured gardens and grounds of approximately 4.8 acres\u201d. The driveway is adorned with a string of luxury cars \u2013 a Bentley, a Tesla, a Porsche and a Range Rover \u2013 while Woodhouse\u2019s love of social media reveals his taste for pursuits such as skiing, skydiving and snorkelling with whale sharks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
