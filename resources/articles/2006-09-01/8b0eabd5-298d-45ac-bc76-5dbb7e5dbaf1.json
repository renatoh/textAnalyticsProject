Traditional forms of gambling, such as betting and casino gaming have been very effectively regulated in the UK since the 1960s. It is the advent of modern technology in the form of remote gambling - particularly on the internet and interactive television - as well as fixed-odds-betting terminals in betting shops that need urgent action. The fundamental cause for concern about the new gambling legislation is the deregulatory approach, particularly to hard gaming. This will allow active commercial promotion and can in no way assist in dealing with the newer forms of gambling based on modern technology. The assertion that the resulting undesirable effects will be dealt with by the Gambling Commission, which will \"protect the vulnerable\", is likely to be illusory. It is all very well to say that \"every aspect of the act can be reversed if there is evidence it causes harm\". This will be of little comfort to families who will already have been adversely affected by this reckless exercise.
