The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, was making the controversial decision over the weekend, after Muslim and human rights groups lobbied for the men to be freed immediately. Sir John's decision to take charge is an indication of how sensitive the matter is. The four have spent up to three years in Guant\u00e1namo Bay after being accused by the United States of being terrorists. There is growing evidence that they were ill-treated. Muslim groups will meet the Home Office minister Hazel Blears today to press for the four to be treated humanely and to be given counselling and support. Until now ministers have said it was up to local agencies to care for the men. In a second meeting today, senior anti-terrorism officers will tell British Muslim leaders of Sir John's decision. The Guardian revealed on Saturday that the four Britons will arrive home tomorrow. Senior police officers are divided about whether they should be arrested. One told the Guardian that arresting the men would create more trouble than it was worth. The officer said British Muslim groups would be outraged, a price not worth paying as there was no chance of their being charged or convicted because any evidence obtained from Guant\u00e1namo would be inadmissible. When five other Britons returned after being released in March 2004, they were held at Paddington Green police station before being released. Two of those due back were visited last week by their lawyer, Clive Stafford-Smith. Mr Stafford-Smith said Moazzam Begg and Richard Belmar had been told that their ordeal in Guant\u00e1namo, where they had been held without charge, was over. Amid growing fears for the men's mental and physical health, Mr Stafford-Smith said: \"No one can go through what they have suffered without terrible consequences.\" He said there was no credible evidence linking them to terrorism. The other two Britons returning tomorrow are Feroz Abbasi and Martin Mubanga. Massoud Shadjareh, chair of the Islamic Human Rights Commission, said: \"These men ... should not be treated as criminal suspects but as victims of torture.\" The Home Office declined to confirm that Ms Blears was meeting Muslim groups today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
