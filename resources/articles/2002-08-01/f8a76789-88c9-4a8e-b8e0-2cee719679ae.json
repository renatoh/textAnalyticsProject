If so, who and what do they play? Are there any musicians/singers who are also good at football?\" asks Rachel Gardiner. There are loads out there, Rachel (providing, of course, you play fast and loose with the word \"musician\"). First in the rock'n'roll queue is former Perugia and LA Galaxy star Alexei Lalas. \"The American ginger goatee man-thing and erstwhile rock star plays the guitar,\" says Ravi Hiranan. \"I saw him play some song called Keep Kickin' Balls on TV once. It was painful.\" Kenneth Sterne totally agrees, man. \"He actually opened for Hootie and the Blowfish on their European tour in 1998 and has released three albums, one titled Ginger,\" says Kenneth, arching an eyebrow. Closer to home, West Ham defender Christian Dailly is the lead singer and guitarist in a band called Hooligan. \"According to some tabloid or other a couple of months back, they were going to release a single,\" says Yvette Thomas. \"No idea what actually happened to it though.\" Meanwhile Nottingham Forest's Frank Clark was a \"dab hand on the acoustic guitar\" according to Martin Widdicks, who also points out that Forest's shaggy-haired striker Paul McGregor (who scored the crucial goal against Lyon in a Uefa Cup tie in 1995/96) was also a singer Britpop band called Merc. Sadly both player and band disappeared without trace. Then there's the novelty football record market. Cue Stuart Maconie-esque reminiscing about Glenn Hoddle and Chris Waddle's Diamond Lights, Paul Gascoigne's Fog on the Tyne and Kevin Keegan's It Ain't Easy and Head Over Heels in Love. More recently, Andy Cole's miserable attempts to tap into the R'n'B/rap crossover market in 2000 with Outstanding (sample lyric: \"I'm kicking racism out the door\") failed to make the top 40. As for musicians playing football, Julio Iglesias was a goalkeeper for Real Madrid in the early sixties, before a serious car accident during the 1961-62 season forced him into retirement. \"He was only 20 and had to spend months in hospital,\" says Antonio Gonzalez. \"The legend has it that the nurse who looked after him gave him a guitar and from then on, he never looked back.\" That's something we've touched upon in a previous bossa-nova-tinged Knowledge. Meanwhile, Rod Stewart was on the books with Brentford before joining the faces while, as Declan Duggan points out, Spandau Ballet's Steve Kemp and Steve Norman signed for Melchester Rovers in 1985 with Martin scoring on his first-team debut. THE LOWER LEAGUES GO EUROPE! \"This season, Ipswich qualified for the Uefa Cup despite having been relegated to the First Division,\" wrote Joseph Poh. \"Has this ever happened to any other team in any country in the history of European football?\" \"Is Joseph an Ipswich fan I wonder?\" ponders Jon Green. \"That might explain why he is ignoring the achievements of Norwich City.\" Jon is, of course, referring to the mind-numbing Milk Cup final of 1985, which the Canaries nicked by a single goal over Sunderland as the watching world slept. The result meant they qualified for the Uefa Cup (although as a result of the Heysel ban, they wouldn't be allowed to compete). City's second League Cup victory would be the highlight of an otherwise disastrous season. Jon Green takes up the story: \"Back in the league, a final-day victory over Chelsea looked enough for survival, with Coventry needing to win their last three games to put Norwich down. Remarkably, even by their own Houdini standards, the Sky Blues pulled this off and City were down.\" Remarkable was indeed the word for Coventry's escapology: they followed 1-0 victories over Stoke and Luton with a 4-1 drubbing of newly-crowned champions Everton, who had just walked the League with a record points total. Poor Norwich slipped into the old Second Division, although at least they had a trophy for company; vanquished Milk Cup finalists Sunderland also went down, but they were on the bones of their arse. However, attacking Europe from the lower divisions isn't the preserve of East Anglians. Crystal Palace went on a European tour in 1998 after finishing bottom of the Premiership the season before. \"We qualified for the Intertoto Cup by virtue of being the only team to apply,\" writes Bobby Dunnett. \"The dream died rather quickly, however, when we lost both legs of our only game to Turkish side Samsunspur.\" Still, it was good while it lasted, wasn't it? Oh. CLARIFICATIONS AND CORRECTIONS: LONGEST TEAM IN THE TOP FLIGHT In last week's Knowledge we said that Arsenal were promoted in 1919. They did go up - but as James Carlin points out: \"Arsenal were not promoted to the First Division, they were selected. Under the rules as they then stood there were teams above them who should have but weren't promoted.\" We should have known better, James, having written on this very subject in this previous Knowledge. We also said that Sunderland were one of the founding 12 clubs of the Football League - however they were one of the first batch of clubs to join when it expanded in 1890. SMALLEST LEAGUE IN THE WORLD \"Which is the smallest football league in the world, how many teams does it have, and how many times do they meet each season?\" asks John Manser. \"The smallest league in the world is on the Isles of Scilly,\" says Charlie Connelly. \"It has two clubs, Woolpack Wanderers and Garrison Gunners, who play each other about 20 times a season. They compete for two cups too. Lots of people turn up and sing 'Can we play you every week?' and each thinks they are the first to think of it. \"Honourable mention should perhaps go to Liechtenstein,\" he adds. \"Despite having seven senior clubs they have no league at all - everyone plays in the Swiss leagues. They do have the keenly-contested Liechtenstein Cup however, with a place in the Uefa Cup up for grabs for the winners, who are regarded as the champions of Liechtenstein. I saw one of the quarter-finals last season - it finished FC Vaduz 14 Schaan Azzuri 2.\" MOST PROMOTED AND RELEGATED CLUB? Back on May 27, Dan Nicholls asked: \"Which current league club(s) have been promoted the most times and which has been relegated the most times?\" \"It's taken me from then until now to find out the answer,\" says an excited Pete Tomlin. \"The team that holds the record for being promoted and relegated the most is Notts County. \"So far County have been promoted 11 times and relegated on 14 occasions, making 25 in total. Following closely behind are Bolton and Grimsby on 24 (12 promotions and 12 relegations) and Birmingham and Manchester City (unsurprisingly!) on 23 (12 promotions, 11 relegations). \"Bolton, Grimsby, Birmingham &amp; Manchester City hold the records for promotions having done so on 12 separate occasions. The dubious honour of being the most relegated team goes to Notts County with 14 demotions in their history.\" And there's more. Much more. \"The teams with the lowest promotion/relegation activity (excluding those no longer in the league or recent joiners) are Rochdale and Arsenal,\" Pete continues. \"Rochdale have only ever been promoted on the one occasion and have suffered just two relegations. Arsenal have done it the other way round - they have been promoted twice and relegated once. \"Wycombe, Cheltenham and Rushden are the only teams to have never suffered a relegation - but of course they have only been in the league for a relatively short time. The only team other than Rushden, past or present, to never be promoted were Gateshead. They were relegated twice but never came back up.\" So now you know. CAN YOU HELP? \"Does the proportion of left footed players in the Premiership mirror the proportion of left footed/handed people in the UK?\" asks John Shaw. \"Consequently is it more likely you'll play professional football if you're left footed?\" \"Why are England's first choice colours white and blue?\" asks Paul Kay \"Surely white shirts and red shorts would be more representative of the nation's flag? Which other countries play in colours not representative of their nation's flag?\" \"What is the smallest number of letters in the combined surnames of the players on the substitutes bench at a professional game (clearly we're looking no further back than the days of five subs)?\" says Phillip Preston. \"I have a candidate from Nottingham Forest's most recent game (away at Walsall): Roche, Jess, Reid, Doig, Bopp - that's 21 letters.\" \"Could you settle an argument that has been going on for a while?\" asks Dee Pattni. \"How many penalties Ray Stewart (former West Ham player) score in his career? More importantly, we want to know how many were missed (not followed in by himself or his team-mates?)\" \"Rotherham's 6-0 away win at Millwall on the opening Saturday has got me thinking,\" says Gareth Morgan. \"What is the most impressive opening day result achieved by a side that has gone on to be relegated?\" \"Which team has provided the largest number of England players?\" asks Gez Maguire.
