As Europe and North America whisper of decline, Asia's \"rising giants\" seem convinced that the 21st century is theirs for the taking. The inelegant neologism \"Chindia\" has already stumbled into the lexicon of analysts and wonks, a measure of the combined heft of the countries' political and economic ambitions. So it is not entirely surprising that in the less wonky realm of art, India and China can steal the show together. In an auction in Paris in late February, a phone bidder won the rights to two bronze heads taken during the pillage of the Summer Palace near Beijing by French troops in 1860. A week later, the bidder, Cai Mingchao, a Chinese collector and campaigner, revealed in a press conference that he had no intention of paying for objects that \"belonged\" to China. Cai's \"sabotage\" provoked hot debate in China and in the west, and had the added effect of generating interest in another, simultaneous controversy over cultural property: the auction in New York of some of the personal effects of Mahatma Gandhi. Though less contentious \u2013 an Indian businessman stepped in to buy the items and will gift them to the Indian government \u2013 the flap over Gandhi's belongings was not without drama of its own. Indian court injunctions, fraught negotiations, and impromptu kerbside press conferences all failed to halt the sale of the objects. Their former owner, Californian hippie James Otis, is now on a 23-day fast to \"cleanse his soul\" in penance for prompting such a global fuss. Otis's conscience may soon be sparkling clean, but both controversies reveal the messy, volatile bounds of cultural property today. In our supposedly \"multipolar\" world, national sovereignty is back in vogue. Feuds like these are not isolated events, but are deeply connected to the buoyant nationalisms that threaten to define our age. The furore around the Summer Palace bronze heads fits in a continuum of anger in China \u2013 from protests against western media last year to vociferous anti-Japanese marches \u2013 that while lambasting an external enemy, is really directed internally, with the aim of tapping and fomenting nationalist passions. There may be a perfectly legitimate argument for the repatriation of the pilfered bronzes. But by attempting to stoke anti-foreign outrage, Cai's publicity stunt seems more disingenuous than principled. Nationalisms anywhere in the world are generally prickly, jealous ideologies that tend to find their apotheosis in unsuspecting symbols. While Indians rightly deplored the sale in New York of Gandhi's glasses, the National Gandhi Museum in New Delhi \u2013 which already houses a pair of his spectacles \u2013 receives very few visitors. There is a hypocrisy of interest here that is typical of nationalisms. The heritage of the nation matters only in moments of strife, when under apparent threat from the outside; otherwise, it is consigned to the dusty safety of platitudes and indifference. But as distasteful and disproportionate as they may be, modern nationalisms can also be in the right. European societies have slowly but steadily come to terms with the excesses of their imperial pasts. The possession of countless non-western artefacts \u2013 often extracted through blatant theft and smuggling \u2013 is part of that legacy. It is not unreasonable to ask westerners to grapple with the moral aspects of the problem of cultural property (and not just its legal dimensions, which cannot reconcile the full contours of the issue): do we have more right to the objects of \"others\" than the \"others\" do? India and China are at the forefront of what Fareed Zakaria terms the \"rise of the rest\", a waning of European and north American pre-eminence as other non-western countries assert themselves on the international stage. That many of these nations will increasingly attempt to regain their patrimony from the west is unsurprising and in keeping with a more equal world. It isn't merely petty nationalism that seeks, for example, the return to India of the Koh-I-Noor diamond in the crown jewels, but a real and undeniable sense of past injustice and, just as importantly, strength and confidence in the present. Of course, the great museums of Paris, New York and London will not be turned overnight (or ever) into quaint, parochial warehouses of national heritage, stripped of the relics of other places. But the static \"world museum\" seems all the more anachronistic in this post-imperial age. The universal pretensions of places like the British Museum, the Louvre, and the Met in New York are lofty and idealistic, but remain testaments of misappropriation, power, and conquest. In a time of resurgent nationalisms, how do we resuscitate the universal ideal that the heritage of others is the heritage of all? Oddly, a good suggestion came from the flighty mind of James Otis, the erstwhile owner of Gandhi's effects. Otis asked the Indian government to sponsor him on a 78-country tour so that he could take the teachings of the Mahatma on the road. One way, perhaps, to renovate the frayed notion of shared global culture would be to establish a roving exhibit of world history and art, a \"moving museum\" that would take in not only western capitals, but places like a Mexico City and Rio, Lagos and Cairo, Mumbai and Shanghai."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
