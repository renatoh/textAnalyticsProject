It traditionally goes something like this: make a row of deep, cylindrical holes with a dibber (an old spade handle sharpened to a point will do); drop one seedling, with its roots and leaves neatly trimmed, into each hole. Only a line of green tufts will be left showing. Water each seedling to settle it in - there's no need to fill in the holes. The reason for sowing them earlier in the spring, then transplanting them now, is to make the best use of space. Leeks are plodders, and must be sown early if they are to reach a reasonable size. However, they do not need much room until June or July. Sow them in pots or a seedbed, and their designated patch can be used to harvest a salad crop or new potatoes first. If you didn't grow your own, it's not too late to buy seedlings (those from Delfland Nurseries are organically grown: 01354 740553, organicplants.co.uk). The idea behind the deep dibber holes is to blanch the leeks (to lengthen the white part of the stem), but this is not strictly necessary with modern varieties. They have a naturally long \"blanch\", even if all the plant is growing above ground. Nevertheless, I still like to dib in my leeks. It's quick, and they rarely go short of moisture in their deep holes. Forget the tradition of topping and tailing seedlings, however - it can reduce yields. The alternative is to put the seedlings in with a trowel, just like any other crop. They will still produce handsome upright plants - ready for a winter harvest. veg.patch@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
