But for five years, Malka Leifer\u2019s court hearings in Jerusalem have been plagued by delays, allegations of contempt and, most seriously, accusations that a senior Israeli cabinet minister may have used his power to stall the trial and prevent her deportation. Now, the slow-moving saga has become entangled in Israel\u2019s fractious politics, and the coming election has further complicated the case. The setbacks have placed a significant strain on the country\u2019s relationship with Zionist and Jewish groups in Australia. \u201cThe Australian Jewish community, I think the Australian general community at large, has been very disappointed with how long that this has taken,\u201d said Jeremy Leibler, president of the Zionist Federation of Australia (ZFA). \u201cThe fact that there have been over 50 hearings \u2013 they have found that to be extremely frustrating.\u201d In February, Israeli police opened an investigation into whether the country\u2019s deputy health minister, Ya\u2019acov Litzman, had obstructed the trial. Litzman is a member of the same religious denomination as Leifer and leads a Jewish ultra-Orthodox party. Manny Waks, founder of Kol V\u2019Oz, an Israel-based organisation against child sex abuse in the global Jewish community, said that when those allegations surfaced, the \u201cpenny dropped\u201d on why the case had been hampered for so long. \u201cTo us, it was very clear that things weren\u2019t right in the hearings for years,\u201d said Waks, who often attends courtroom appearances. Many of the delays have been around whether Leifer has been mentally fit to stand trial or be extradited. Two years after she was arrested in 2014, a Jerusalem district psychiatrist submitted a medical report deeming her mentally incompetent, and she was released from house arrest. But videos taken by a private investigator and shared with the Guardian appeared to show her living a \u201cnormal, healthy\u201d life. Israeli police rearrested Leifer on suspicion of \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d and the state prosecution accused her of feigning mental illness. Leifer, an Israeli citizen who has been living in a settlement in the occupied West Bank, now faces the possibility of an indictment under contempt of court charges. Her lawyer denies all allegations against her. The local media have reported suspicions that the psychiatrist\u2019s evaluations were falsified under pressure from Litzman. And last month, further allegations against Litzman were raised when Israel\u2019s Channel 13 news reported that the minister was alleged to have helped at least 10 serious sex offenders among ultra-Orthodox Jews to obtain improved conditions, including home visits, by putting pressure on psychiatrists and prisons service employees. In the past, Litzman has been criticised for visiting a rabbi who served five months in prison for sex crimes, and for bailing out an ultra-Orthodox woman accused of starving her toddler. Some ultra-Orthodox Jews threatened riots if the woman was not released and Litzman was quoted at the time as saying that bail would \u201cpacify the situation\u201d. Litzman\u2019s office denied the allegations of blocking Leifer\u2019s trial, saying the minister was \u201cconvinced that there is no basis to the leaks and the slandering against him\u201d. In reference to the Channel 13 report, it said: \u201cAs far as Litzman is concerned, sexual delinquency and sexual abuse are like murder. There is and will be no forgiveness for it, and the place of sexual offenders is in prison without relief. \u201cThe hallucinatory attempt to infect Litzman with support for sex offenders is false, vicious, and terrible.\u201d Litzman retains his position despite the police investigation, and this has angered activists, alleged victims and Australian Jewish groups. \u201cOnce the allegations became public, it was disturbing to see that it was business as usual for the government,\u201d said Waks. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s disappointing, perplexing.\u201d As head of the United Torah Judaism alliance in parliament, Litzman wields significant influence in Israeli politics, further complicating the Leifer case. He is seen as a crucial part of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing coalition bloc, and the Israeli leader has sought to keep him loyal. Last month, former defence minister Avigdor Leiberman refused to join the government until Netanyahu promised to support measures to force ultra-Orthodox Jews to serve in the army. Since Israel\u2019s founding in 1948, they have been exempted and allowed to study religious texts instead. But Litzman and others did not back down, knowing Netanyahu also needed their seats in parliament, leading to a political crisis that plunged Israel into a second round of elections just a month after it held a national poll. \u201cNo doubt, the election created a whole series of instabilities in Israel and this is one of them,\u201d said Leibler. But he was optimistic that a coming verdict, set for September, would lead to Leifer\u2019s extradition. Former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull had made \u201cvery strong representations\u201d to Netanyahu during a visit, and Leibler said he was confident Scott Morrison would do the same. He did not believe that Litzman, who was \u201cbeing watched very carefully\u201d, would continue to block the case, or that Netanyahu might attempt to keep Leifer in Israel to appease Litzman. However, the election is scheduled for 17 September and Leifer\u2019s final verdict is on 23 September, meaning a different government might be making decisions on the case. Despite what the court finds, it is up to the justice minister to sign off on the extradition. \u201cI hope and I expect the prime minister will have regard to this case when he decides who he appoints in the justice ministry following the election, assuming that he is even the prime minister,\u201d said Leibler. \u201cWe do place our open faith in the Israeli system. We\u2019re hopeful now this is closer to some sort of conclusion.\u201d If extradited, Leifer is expected to face 74 charges, including indecent assault and rape. The Jewish school that hired the principal was ordered in 2015 to pay more than $1.1m in compensatory damages. For Leifer\u2019s alleged victims, an end to the half-decade trial could not come sooner. Three sisters, Dassi Erlich, Ellie Sapper and Nicole Meyer, have accused Leifer of abusing them in Melbourne. They have run a campaign called #Bringleiferback but remain frustrated at the lack of progress. Last month, the Israel\u2013Australia Chamber of Commerce (IACC) apologised after setting up a meeting in which the deputy premier of Western Australia, Roger Cook, met Litzman in Jerusalem. \u201cTo say this was very hurtful, worrying and discouraging is an understatement,\u201d the sisters had written in a letter to the IACC. \u201cTo those of us waiting every day for justice, this recent meeting feels like a slap in the face.\u201d Additional reporting by Quique Kierszenbaum \u2022 This article was amended on 25 July 2019.
