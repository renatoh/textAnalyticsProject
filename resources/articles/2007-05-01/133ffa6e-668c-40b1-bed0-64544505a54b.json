To the usual cheers and jeers has been added the sound of axes grinding. Even the normally phlegmatic Steve Coppell felt moved to have a go at the loans system after Ben Foster, the goalkeeper Watford have borrowed from Manchester United, achieved a shut-out as Reading were beaten at the Madejski Stadium last weekend. And Chelsea's Jose Mourinho, football's Victor Meldrew, keeps on grumbling just as Felix the Cat kept on walking. The officers of the Premier League might be forgiven a sigh of relief should West Ham United be relegated tomorrow, which will happen if Alan Curbishley's team lose at Old Trafford and Wigan win 1-0 at Sheffield United. Wigan, Sheffield, Charlton and Fulham, all struggling to stay up at the time, threatened to sue last week when West Ham were fined \u00a35.5m for fielding two Argentinians of opaque registration, Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano (now at Liverpool), but did not have points deducted. They have also demanded proof that the third-party agreement with Tevez's agents has been torn up, allowing the striker to continue playing for the east London club. The league has, in effect, told the protesters to get lost and, now that Fulham are safe and Charlton are down, some of the momentum will have been taken out of the argument. Yet if Wigan or Sheffield United are relegated tomorrow the rancour will surely continue. For years a loss of points has been the customary punishment for teams who field ineligible players, but it is not mandatory. The Premier League insist, moreover, that the two were eligible to play at all times. So the only case the offended clubs really have is a lack of consistency on the part of the disciplinary panel, which imposed the biggest fine in the history of the English game - this and the moral argument that should West Ham survive they will, in effect, have paid \u00a35.5m to hold on to Tevez, whose timely partnership with Bobby Zamora has done much to bring them six victories in eight games and a strong chance of survival. And that would be cheap at the price. There never used to be this fuss when teams went down. Relegation was an inconvenience but nobody thought of going to the High Court to get, if not an adjustment to the bottom of the table, then big bucks in compensation. Indeed in some cases clubs regarded a period out of the top division as a chance to reorganise with a view to winning promotion quickly with a reinvigorated side. Manchester United and Tottenham were not mortally wounded by brief spells in the old Second Division in the 1970s and although it took Liverpool eight years to get back after their relegation in 1954 their return marked the beginning of the Bill Shankly era and all that has followed. The difference now is that Premiership clubs are competing in a plutocracy in which serious fears of relegation are confined to those just promoted, those who have hung on for a season or two, those who suddenly get stuck in a losing rut and those who simply run out of luck at the wrong time. The cost of failure is forever rising and the present row reflects an anxiety not to miss out on the latest windfall from television which will guarantee \u00a330m to the club finishing bottom next season, a wooden spoon with a gold handle. Paul Jewell, a voice of sanity at the JJB Stadium, has pointed out that Wigan are where they are because they have not won enough matches. Ditto Sheffield United, Charlton and Watford, who have at least gone down with dignity and given their manager, the worthy Adrian Boothroyd, a new contract. If the more litigious chairmen feel like suing anybody perhaps they should serve a writ on Jim Devine, the linesman at Blackburn who decided that a shot from Zamora had crossed the line when in reality it had inadvertently been blocked by Tevez, who was offside anyway. This goal began the winning run which may well keep West Ham in the Premiership. Whatever the altercations at the bottom, there can be no disputing the fact that the Premiership has been won not only by the best but by the most watchable team. And the reason why Manchester United are consistently worth watching is that they combine skill and imagination with a readiness to take a gamble which will always add to the attraction. The attack by Jorge Valdano, the Argentinian World Cup winner and former Real Madrid coach, on Chelsea and Liverpool, complaining that they were sacrificing subtlety and guile for strength and organisation, was a mite over the top. Yet it must be admitted that the tactical mindset of both Mourinho at Stamford Bridge and Rafael Ben\u00edtez at Anfield makes the elimination of risk a priority. Sometimes, watching Chelsea grind away, it is hard not to feel that one touch of Gianfranco Zola would be worth a dozen runs by Frank Lampard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
