We toyed with him this week about how many goals he\u2019s actually scored. He said \u2018one\u2019, and you could see on his face a look of disgust with himself. So I\u2019m really pleased for him. We were ruthless here: we took virtually every chance we had.\u201d Reading\u2019s Nigel Adkins said: \u201cIt was very, very close in terms of the game, but not in terms of the scoreline. We\u2019ll reflect on it.\u201d Brentford 3-1 Blackburn Rovers The Brentford manager, Mark Warburton, tipped his striker Andre Gray to reach the top after his ninth goal of the season helped sink fellow promotion hopefuls Blackburn. \u201cHe loves scoring and that\u2019s a big part of the character of a centre-forward. Can we keep him? Everyone has a price. The owner will decide the price. That\u2019s life, but right now this is a good place to be. I think anyone would think long and hard before leaving.\u201d Gary Bowyer said: \u201cIt\u2019s a major disappointment, we came here to win \u2026 but Brentford are a club on the rise.\u201d And the rest Ipswich missed the chance to go top with a 0-0 draw at Bolton. \u25a0 An 89th-minute Steven Davies equaliser gave Blackpool a 2-2 draw at Charlton. \u25a0 Fulham beat Leeds 1-0 at Elland Road via a Hugo Rodallega strike. \u25a0 Norwich thumped 10-man Huddersfield 5-0. \u25a0 Rotherham drew 0-0 with Forest. \u25a0 And Leon Clarke struck as Wolves beat Sheffield Wednesday 1-0."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
