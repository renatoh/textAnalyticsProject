The low-cost airline says online travel agents often double the fare and fail to fully inform passengers of the airline's terms and conditions. One flight from London to Frankfurt on 2 April cost \u00a39.99 when booked direct with Ryanair, it said, but \u00a319.99 when booked via Ebookers - an increase of 100 per cent. Another, from London to Dublin on 20 March, cost \u00a314.99 with Ryanair and \u00a334.99 with Global Holidays - a 133 per cent hike. Ryanair is not the only airline affected. We found that a return Easyjet flight from Gatwick to Geneva in April cost \u00a363.98 with the airline, but \u00a368.93 with Wegolo.com and \u00a372.18 with Flightsdirect.com. Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's spokesman, said credit card and web bookings believed to be from an online agent would be blocked. 'We are doing this to inform passengers they will get better value by booking directly,' he said. Easyjet said it was also considering action. 'While allowing online agencies to access our flights puts our product in front of more people, it may be detrimental to the brand if the agencies start increasing the prices and make us look more expensive than competitors,' said spokeswoman Samantha Day. The online booking sites argue that they are not ripping people off. They say the additional fees are in line with other travel agents, cover their costs and allow them to provide a broader range of services. 'We've got nothing to hide, we think our customers are getting value for money,' said Mark Brock of Barrhead Travel, which owns Flightsdirect. 'The \u00a310 mark-up we put on flights ensures they are Abta and Atol bonded, unlike those bought direct with the airline, and means customers have access to fare comparison technology.' John Bevan, of Lastminute, claimed 'Ryanair is fully satisfied with the terms and conditions published on our site'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
