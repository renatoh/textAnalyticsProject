The three-movement form of Huw Watkins's Piano Concerto made it the most conventionally structured of the four pieces. With more than a touch of Bart\u00f3k in its chromatic colour, the language finds a balance between rhapsodic and tightly argued material. Watkins himself delivered the solo part with even greater assurance than at its 2002 premiere. David Sawer's Byrnan Wood - in which the ostensibly static orchestra becomes like a moving mass, comparable to Shakespeare's image of Malcolm's army advancing on Macbeth's Dunsinane - was given a shimmering treatment by conductor Jac van Steen. Sawer's exacting approach to the elemental nature of sound was complemented by Arlene Sierra's Aquilo, in which the rushing energy of wind, fire and water was vividly captured. But it was Christian Jost's CocoonSymphonie that was most involving. Van Steen suggested that the work, conceived in five interlinked sections and subtitled Five Gateways of a Journey Into the Interior, was a modern parallel to Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, whose less familiar main title is An Episode in the Life of the Artist. While the philosophical basis of Jost's exploration of self had its own validity, the music had a natural theatricality. From the bold unison string opening, it held the attention effortlessly, with the disposition of two trios of horns as well as two sets of timpani creating a drama that implied both internal and external conflict."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
