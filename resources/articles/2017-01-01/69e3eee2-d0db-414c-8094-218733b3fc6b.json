Conte has recalled Nathan Ak\u00e9 from a loan spell at Bournemouth, a decision that the manager says \u201cmakes me more calm, also in the market in January\u201d, and he has another centre-half, Kurt Zouma, back to fitness after an 11-month layoff. With C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, David Luiz and Gary Cahill established as the first choices in the back three, Terry\u2019s prospects have come to look bleak. He made his first appearance in two months against Peterborough United in the FA Cup victory last Sunday only to be sent off, meaning he is suspended for the trip to Leicester City on Sunday. Terry is out of contract in the summer and there has been no indication Chelsea are prepared to offer him new terms. Eddie Howe, the Bournemouth manager \u2013 on the back of losing Ak\u00e9 \u2013 made a speculative inquiry this week to see whether there was be any chance of taking Terry this month. However, the move has seemingly failed to turn the 36\u2011year\u2011old\u2019s head, with Conte maintaining he wanted to keep a player who, even when he is not in the team, is an inspiration in the dressing room. \u201cHonestly, no,\u201d Conte said, when asked whether there had been a conversation between him and Terry about Bournemouth. \u201cAnd with John, I speak every day. John never talked to me about this situation and it means he is very happy to stay here and, above all, I am very happy John stays here and helps me. \u201cJohn is an important player for me \u2013 if he plays or doesn\u2019t play \u2013 because he\u2019s a really important man in the changing room. This squad needs him. He\u2019s a great player but also a great man and for me it\u2019s fantastic to have a person like him to help me in my first season at Chelsea. I repeat, John stays with us. He is our player, he is in my squad.\u201d Conte added he saw Terry as management material. \u201cWhen he decides to finish his career, he could have a good prospect to start a new career as a manager. He is clever and really good at understanding situations. But [only] when he is finished. For now, leave him to play.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
