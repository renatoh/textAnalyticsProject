While Britain\u2019s No 1, coming off a solid season, has every intention of playing in the Australian Open next month, a knee injury that nagged at her throughout 2019 may yet wreck her plans. \u201cI\u2019m not giving myself any deadlines,\u201d she says. \u201cI will be ready when I\u2019m ready. Hopefully that will be Brisbane [6 January] but, if it\u2019s not then, it will be when it will be. I\u2019m also planning to play Adelaide [13 January] and Melbourne [20 January] but I can only listen to my body. I have definitely booked that flight but I\u2019m not going to be putting myself in that position if I\u2019m not ready. I am certainly hopeful.\u201d Konta, who began the season 38 in the world, slipped as low as 47 in April and goes to Australia ranked 12, can look back with satisfaction at a semi-final and two quarter-finals in two of the four majors, and earnings of more than $2m. But, at 28, she wants more. \u201cI have been carrying a knee injury since the first week of the year, in Brisbane [where she beat the third seed, Sloane Stephens, in her only match],\u201d she says. A neck twinge forced her to withdraw in Sydney, where she was born, and she went out in the second round of the Australian Open, starting her marathon three-setter against Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza at 12.30am (the latest in the tournament\u2019s history) and finishing at 3am. \u201cIt was a case of managing [the knee injury] through the year,\u201d she says, looking back on that tough run. \u201cThere were periods when it was better and when it was worse.\u201d There was a grinding Fed Cup tie [Great Britain\u2019s first at home in 28 years] when Konta held the team together in Bath against Slovenia and Serbia with astonishing physical commitment. When she collapsed off-court during the win over Aleksandra Krunic that sealed Britain\u2019s progress to the world group play-off, concerns grew that she was red-lining dangerously. She reached the final in Rome \u2013 her first on clay \u2013 losing to the world No 2, Karolina Pliskova, then had to confront her French blues. Konta had not got out of the first round at Roland Garros in four attempts but she was flying now and reached the semi-finals, where she lost to the unseeded Czech teenager Mark\u00e9ta Vondrousov\u00e1 (whom she had beaten in Rome). It was an avoidable setback in sight of the prize and it hurt. \u201cThe match that was not necessarily a disappointment but it hurt the most and took a few extra days to digest and move forward from was the semi-final of the French,\u201d she admits. \u201cThat was quite a tough match for me to lose and digest. \u201cOnce we got to the grass the knee got worse and worse, although she beat Stephens for the fourth time in a row and the two-time champion Petra Kvitova on her way to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon, where she found Barbara Strycova too strong, and then at the US Open it felt significantly worse.\u201d Nevertheless it took Elina Svitolina to end her season and her best run at Flushing Meadows, in the quarter-finals; after that Konta was physically and mentally spent. \u201cI had to look into how I wanted to keep going. I had more tests done [to discover the injury is similar to tendinitis] and took the decision to take time out to rehabilitate it to be back in time for Moscow and Zhuhai [towards the end of the season] maybe. \u201cBut once we got closer to the deadline, it didn\u2019t seem the right path to take. I was rehabbing until just before Moscow but then decided to take a holiday and I\u2019ve been in pre-season since that finished.\u201d Although she had a widely discussed bust-up with a British tennis writer at Wimbledon (bridling at the perceived slight that she bottled it against lesser players in big moments), Konta is an eternally upbeat character and has never let injuries or setbacks get her down for long. \u201cI found myself in quite a low place at the end of 2017,\u201d she says, \u201cso it was quite a big hole for me to climb out of. Although 2018 wasn\u2019t that good results-wise, it probably gave me the best gift I could have had which was to start enjoying the sport again. Without 2018 I wouldn\u2019t have 2019.\u201d Of the current status of her knee injury, she says: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely on the way up but it\u2019s still going to take some managing, even into next season. \u201cThe main thing has been to get it to a stage where I can function at the highest level \u2013 and that\u2019s the stage we are getting to now, where we are raising the amount of time on court and slowly feeling like a normal tennis player again. I\u2019m up to two hours a day on court, which is nearly normal plus all the gym stuff.\u201d A walking holiday in Scotland with her boyfriend and her dog cheered her up immensely. The sun will no doubt be shining when she lands in Sydney in the new year (if tinged by bushfire smoke and haze), and Konta will start again, \u201chopeful\u201d \u2013 as ever. \u2022 This article was changed on 20 December to reflect the fact that Konta reached a semi-final and two quarter-finals from the four majors in 2019."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
