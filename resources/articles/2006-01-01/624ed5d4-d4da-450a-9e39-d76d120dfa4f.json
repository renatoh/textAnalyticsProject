Our small creative business, established nearly 10 years ago, was almost destroyed by its founding director's gross misconduct, specifically fraud and theft. He was sacked five years ago and it has taken this time to restore the company's financial health, work, profile and good relations with clients and others. This person has since secured employment and places on other firms' boards, despite no references from us. It is only now that he has begun to refer publicly to his previous relationship with our company. We wish to dissociate ourselves from this individual, particularly as we are now beginning to enjoy a good name, status and respect. What can we do? I can see why you find this distasteful, but I'm not sure why you think it's potentially damaging. It's obvious that he hopes to gain credibility by associating himself with his former company - which, even from such a discredited source, is a kind of compliment, I suppose. It seems to me that only if clients or potential employees ask you for some sort of reference for this man should you move into active disassociation mode. Fraud and theft are serious offences. If he was charged and convicted, you can simply make this fact known. You run no risk. It's a lot more tricky if his departure from your company was settled out of court. Consult your lawyer before you say anything about him to anybody. But unless specifically asked about him, my instinct is that you should maintain a lofty silence. I don't want to delegate to my deputy while I'm off I'm the MD of a small advertising company. I am due to have an operation on my slipped disc next month and will be out of the office for two months. Convention dictates that my deputy should manage the company in my absence, but I have a very capable CFO who I would prefer to leave in charge. My deputy hasn't seemed very focused recently, whereas the CFO is bright and organised. Should I follow etiquette or trust my instincts? If the people in your advertising company are anything like advertising people generally, they will harbour venerable prejudices about financial directors. It is universally accepted that CFOs wouldn't recognise a great ad if it popped up as their screen-saver; that they're interested only in cost-cutting and bureaucracy (three signatures for any taxi fare over \u00a36 - to be obtained in advance); that they regard a tuna on brown and a small semi-skimmed at the desk a healthy and productive use of lunchtime; and that they are inimical to clients because, unlike everyone else, they are insensitive enough to want to talk money. In other words, advertising people do not see financial directors as One of Us. You should take these childish misconceptions into account before making your decision. It's possible that your dithering deputy, if put firmly in the hot seat for a couple of months, might miraculously re-find some sort of focus. If, however, you really do rate your CFO, and believe him to be more than your slightly chilling description \"capable\", cross your fingers and give him a go. It could be the making of him; though remember that the record of financial people leading advertising companies is not a noble one. Will sacking wreck my chances of another job? After seven years in one job, I have been sacked for poor time-keeping. I am looking for other work, but I realise that the fact that I've been sacked is going to make any potential employer wary of giving me a job. What can I do to maximise my chance of being interviewed? How do I approach the CV and the inevitable awkward questions at interviews? I find it difficult to believe that you were a consistently poor time-keeper for the whole of that seven years. If so, you must have had an unusually tolerant employer or an unusually unobservant one. It seems a great deal more likely that you were punctual enough for the first five years or so - and then began to drift into bad habits. I wonder why? Perhaps the job had stopped engaging you? I'm guessing here, of course; but what I'm trying to do is get you to flesh out that bald statement, \"I've been sacked for poor time-keeping\". You'll have as good a chance as you deserve at interviews if you tell the whole truth. For example: \"I stayed much longer than I should have done in a job that had begun to bore me. If I'd been sensible, I'd have looked around two years ago. Instead, I hung on in there, and my boredom showed. In the end, they fired me for poor time-keeping - and I guess they were absolutely right to do so. The reason I'm so keen on this job is I know it will thoroughly engage me; and when I'm engaged, I'm the most conscientious person in the world.\" That's my shot at a truth. Tell your own and you should be OK. Conviction case Two weeks ago in this column I addressed an enquiry from a 48-year-old man who was considering entering nursing or teaching. His problem: at 14, he'd had a criminal conviction. His question: did he have to declare it when applying for jobs? My advice: \"You've been straight for 34 years. Why break that excellent record by lying now?\" This prompted a lot of letters. Several pointed out that, under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, offences carried out by a juvenile and carrying a prison sentence of less than 30 months automatically become \"spent\" when the person reaches 18. According to them, my correspondent would not, therefore, have been lying if he failed to declare his conviction. However, others noted that he was interested in teaching and nursing - jobs that are specifically exempt from the ROA. Applicants for these positions will be subject to an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check, which will reveal all spent and unspent convictions. So, for my correspondent, when applying for these particular jobs, lying was not even an option. My thanks to all those who wrote. It's a complex area, as Ruth Kelly, among others, has discovered. \u00b7 Jeremy Bullmore writes a column for Management Today, in which some of these questions first appeared.
