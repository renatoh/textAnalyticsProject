HSBC will top the table today with interim profits of about \u00a34.5bn, making it one of Europe's most profitable companies and surpassing last year's equivalent of \u00a33.8bn. Though its chairman, Sir John Bond, makes no secret of his disdain for Britain's regulatory environment, HSBC has grown rapidly since taking over Midland a decade ago. Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays are also scheduled to report this week, along with Standard Chartered which, although listed in London, is a more familiar name on high streets in Asia and Africa and is likely to come in at just under \u00a31bn. Royal Bank of Scotland is expected to produce six-month profits of just under \u00a34bn, making it Britain's second most profitable bank. RBS's size and profitability have risen since its takeover of NatWest four years ago and the expansion of its Citizen's banking operation in the US. With HSBC, RBS is one of the big four. It has eclipsed the other two members - Barclays and Lloyds TSB - in terms of profits. Barclays is expected to make first-half profits of about \u00a32bn while Lloyds TSB last week reported earnings of \u00a31.5bn. HBOS and Alliance &amp; Leicester reported their profits last week and made \u00a32.1bn and \u00a3268m respectively. The results are being announced in the midst of the prospective bidding war for Abbey National, which last week agreed to be taken over by Banco Santander Central Hispano of Spain. Abbey said it had found a buyer after returning to profit for the first time in two years and after the new management team sold off risky bond investments and drew a line under the liabilities of its life insurance arm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
