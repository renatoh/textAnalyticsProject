Baros saw a potential move to the Bundesliga club Schalke 04 fall through last night after the German club accepted that they were unable to fund a \u00a37m move. While Aston Villa retain an interest in the 23-year-old - they had a \u00a35m bid rejected last month - Everton would represent a more appealing destination given that David Moyes' side have qualified for European competition. Everton have yet to lodge a formal bid for the Czech though the forward falls within budget, even at Liverpool's price, and dialogue with their city rivals is imminent. Their need to recruit a striker was heightened yesterday with confirmation that Johnson, who made his England debut last season, has pledged his immediate future to Palace. The 25-year-old handed in a transfer request after the club's relegation in May but will now remain in south London in an attempt to propel them back to the Premiership. That will disappoint Tottenham, West Bromwich, Birmingham City and Everton, who have all inquired about his availability. The Anfield manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez has avoided allowing Baros to become cup-tied in Uefa competition this close-season, so as to help facilitate any transfer. Liverpool intend to use any money raised to bolster their defence. Deportivo la Coruna are currently anticipating a bid from Liverpool for their Portuguese defender Jorge Andrade. \"I have some individuals in mind and we have some names,\" Ben\u00edtez said. \"It would be better if the player was not cup-tied in Europe but if that's not possible, we can manage. If possible, we'd like to bring someone new in but I'd prefer to find the right player rather than rush it. If we need to, we will wait.\" The Spaniard responded yesterday to Jose Mourinho's claim that Steven Gerrard will regret his decision to remain at Anfield, by insisting the Chelsea manager's comments reflect the renewed threat posed by Liverpool. Mourinho claimed Gerrard's rejection of a move would be \"a loss for him, for his career\" and suggested that Chelsea would claim more honours over the next 10 years than Gerrard could hope to achieve as a Liverpool player. \"It's a compliment in many ways,\" said Ben\u00edtez, who is expected to rest certain key players for this evening's Champions League second-round qualifying tie against FBK Kaunas, who trail 3-1. \"I like it when people like Mourinho talk about us. It means they consider us more of an important club than we were last season. Other English clubs clearly know we are more dangerous this year. \"Maybe they are worried about us. We are the European champions, we have Steven Gerrard who will be focused, and we have signed good players this summer so we will be a better side, for sure.\" FBK Kaunas arrive at Anfield in some turmoil after parting company with their manager, Aleksandr Piskiarov, in the wake of last week's first-leg defeat. Igoris Pankratjevas has taken over in his stead. Kaunas are 15 points behind the league leaders Ekranas and FBK's owner Vladimir Romanov, who also has a controlling stake in Hearts, is deeply frustrated at the lack of success this season. Liverpool (probable, 4-4-2): Reina; Josemi, Carragher, Hyypia, Riise; Potter, Hamann, Alonso, Zenden; Ciss\u00e9, Morientes. FBk Kaunas (probable, 4-4-2): Kurskis; Kancelskis, Baguzis, Zelmikas, Manchkhava; Tamosauskas, Poderis, Klimek, Barevicius; Velicka, Rimkevicius. Referee: G Paparesta (Italy).
