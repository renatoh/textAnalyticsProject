There are another 37 games to go,\" Steve Clarke, the West Bromwich Albion head coach and erstwhile Liverpool assistant, said. \"You know the talent that Liverpool football club have got. I stand by that. They will challenge for a top-four place.\" These are early days but those Liverpool supporters who slipped out with 13 minutes remaining will take some convincing that qualifying for the Champions League is a legitimate target this season. Enough was enough for a section of the travelling contingent when Romelu Lukaku met Liam Ridgewell's cross to inflict Liverpool's heaviest opening-day defeat since 1937. Liverpool were playing with 10 men at that point, after Daniel Agger, right, had been dismissed for a professional foul on Shane Long, although it may as well have been nine, so anonymous was Steven Gerrard. As the clocked ticked down in the second half the Liverpool captain resembled a dazed passenger on the hard shoulder of the motorway trying to make sense of the wreckage around him. Martin Skrtel never looked comfortable at the back while up front Luis Su\u00e1rez carried on where he left off last season: troubling defenders with his nimble footwork and getting into all the right positions but failing to turn decent opportunities into goals. Enough of the hard-luck stories; it was down to poor finishing, rather than misfortune, that Liverpool had the lowest chance-conversion rate in the Premier League in 2011-12 and it is difficult to see those figures improving much as long as Su\u00e1rez is deployed as a lone striker. \"If we are going to affect the top of this league, we have got to score more goals,\" Brendan Rodgers said. This was a chastening day for the Liverpool manager and provided a reminder, as if Rodgers needed one, of the size of the job that he has taken on. Sorting out the mess he inherited at Anfield will be one thing; trying to introduce a more expansive style of play that everyone buys into is quite another. \"There are going to be more days of hurt, in terms of where we are trying to go,\" Rodgers said. Although Liverpool were unfortunate to be behind at half-time, after Zoltan Gera marked his return from nine months on the sidelines with a majestic volley, it was alarming to see how they imploded after the interval, in particular following Agger's sending off. If anything summed up their miserable afternoon it was the sight of Joe Cole leaving the field with a hamstring strain nine minutes after coming on. Good luck shifting him this month. Of the new acquisitions, Joe Allen fared better than Franco Borini, who looked lost on the left flank as part of a disappointing three-man attacking midfield that included Gerrard and the ineffective Stewart Downing. Allen occupied a more withdrawn role, alongside Lucas Leiva, and was neat and tidy in possession without ever really hurting Albion. Indeed it was another holding midfielder, in an Albion shirt, who caught the eye. Claudio Yacob, a 25-year-old Argentina international signed on a free transfer this summer, was outstanding alongside Youssouf Mulumbu and it was no surprise when he was named man of the match. Yacob and Mulumbu cost a combined \u00a3175,000, which must make Liverpool, and many other Premier League clubs for that matter, wince. Another pat on the back for Dan Ashworth, Albion's highly-rated sporting and technical director. Clarke acknowledged that this game could have gone down a different path if Su\u00e1rez had taken one of his chances, although in Liverpool eyes it was the red card that served as a turning point. \"I think we controlled the game before the sending off,\" Agger said. \"We had the momentum, we kept the ball well and we created chances. The red card changed the game. I've seen it again on television and there is no contact. But the referee has made the decision and we can't change it.\" Long's woeful penalty provided Liverpool with a reprieve but four minutes later Phil Dowd, the referee, was pointing to the spot again, after Skrtel clumsily tripped the Albion striker. Peter Odemwingie dispatched his kick with conviction and from that moment on it was a matter of how many Albion wanted to score. Lukaku, who is on loan from Chelsea and looked a handful when he came on, eventually made it 3-0 to get Clarke's managerial career off to the best possible start. As for Rodgers, next up in the Premier League is a home game against the champions. Man of the match Claudio Yacob (WBA)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
