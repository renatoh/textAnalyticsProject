A comparatively new sport in Britain, the first race for huskies was held in south-east England in 1980. At that time there were only 75 Siberian huskies in this country, now there are thousands, most of them kept for racing. Originally they were known as Eskimo dogs, and worked in Arctic regions. Teams of as many as eight dogs are harnessed to sleds or wheeled rigs, and a speed of 15mph can be maintained for several hours. Trails through our Kielder forestry entail hilly ground and a lot of turns, so tactical handling is just as important as dogged determination. The Forestry Commission is working with the Kielder sled dog group to create more racing trails because this forest is so huge that it can accommodate this canine sport with minimal disturbance to other forest users. There has not been a flake of snow for the rallies for several years now, so the teams of dogs pull three-wheeled rigs. There is virtually no steering; the cleverest dogs are the leaders and mushers use verbal commands. Not much scope for a passenger, but I managed to hang on for about 15 minutes before rolling off the rig into an icy puddle when we paused for a rest. The old Eskimo dogs bred in the arctic carried plume tails curled over their backs, but the Siberian husky today carries a down brush, rather like a wolf. One of their characteristics is their inability to bark, so vocal efforts take the form of howling. In the absence of snow, courses are sometimes shortened, so the majority of the mushers come to meetings in Kielder forest with both a sled for snow and a wheeled rig for racing on dirt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
