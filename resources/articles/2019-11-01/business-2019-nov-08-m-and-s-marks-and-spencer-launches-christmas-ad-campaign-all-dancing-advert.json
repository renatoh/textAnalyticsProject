Set to House of Pain\u2019s 1992 hit Jump Around, the ad was made by the British director Jake Nava, best known for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Single Ladies music video. The M&amp;S ad, which launched on Friday, features a cast of dancers \u201cjumping around\u201d in M&amp;S jumpers. The choreography in the M&amp;S\u2019s \u201cGo Jumpers\u201d commercial is less complex than the routine tackled by Beyonc\u00e9 and her backing troupe in Nava\u2019s video, with the retailer offering advice on how to master the simple move (instructions: \u201cadopt a power stance\u201d and then roll your shoulder forward and back \u2013 and repeat). The store chain is hoping shoulder-rollers will then film their efforts and share their videos on social media using the hashtag #gojumpers. Nathan Ansell, M&amp;S\u2019s director of marketing for clothing and home, said the infectiousness of the shoulder roll move had been picked up in focus groups. This week M&amp;S reported a drop in first-half profits after a sharp decline in clothing sales and the retailer hopes the feel-good ad will pull in shoppers. Its chief executive, Steve Rowe, has said a new design team will shed M&amp;S\u2019s reputation for \u201cfrumpiness\u201d. The M&amp;S ad, which unlike last year does not feature its TV presenter fashion muse Holly Willoughby, is designed to throw the spotlight on its knitwear as strong sales of woolies could be key to its financial success this Christmas. M&amp;S has said it expects to shift 6m jumpers and is trying to attract more young families to its stores. The ad features 50 jumpers costing anywhere between \u00a320 and \u00a3150 \u2013 plus a \u00a319.50 patterned jumper for dogs. The festive ad heralds the start of the annual battle for hearts and minds in what is known as the \u201cgolden quarter\u201d for retailers, when stores make the vast majority of their profits. Shoppers are expected to spend \u00a380bn in the final six weeks of the season alone, according to a report by the Centre for Retail Research for VoucherCodes.co.uk. The M&amp;S ad is part of a record \u00a36.8bn festive advertising spree this year as companies try to tempt people to spend after a tumultuous year in which some big names \u2013 most recently Mothercare \u2013 have gone to the wall. John Lewis\u2019s festive advert has become an annual event thanks to its catalogue of emotional ads that have included Monty the penguin and the tale of a lonely man on the moon. Ikea also entered the fray for the first time on Friday with an irreverent ad set to an original grime track voiced by MC D Double E. Some of the retail industry\u2019s biggest names, including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and John Lewis, will wait until after Remembrance Day on 11 November for their big reveals. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2019 to include the name of the commissioner of the report by the Centre for Retail Research."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
