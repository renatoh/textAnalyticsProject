Folau\u2019s fundraising page for his court action has been removed for breaching GoFundMe\u2019s terms of service, the digital fundraising platform said, with all donors to be refunded. A spokesman for Folau characterised GoFundMe\u2019s decision to take down his fundraising campaign as \u201cvery disappointing\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately, GoFundMe has buckled to demands against the freedom of Australians to donate to his cause,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThere appears to be a continuing campaign of discrimination against Israel and his supporters.\u201d The rugby star had collected more than $750,000 as of Sunday night as he sought donations from the public for his legal fight, with a $3m target. \u201cThankfully, several organisations have already expressed interest in supporting Israel\u2019s efforts to raise money for his ongoing legal case,\u201d a spokesman said. Folau had his $4m employment contract terminated in May after he made social media posts saying \u201chell awaits\u201d homosexuals, which were deemed in breach of its code of conduct, and after previous warnings from Rugby Australia not to denigrate people on the basis of their sexuality. The player announced he would challenge the decision in court and set up a GoFundMe account asking for donations to \u201cstand up for the word of God\u201d. His spokesman said the former Wallaby was grateful to the 10,000 plus people who had believed in good faith their donations would aid his case. He said Folau\u2019s website had come under \u201csustained cyber-attack\u201d and there had been a \u201cdeliberate attempt to vilify his wife Maria for supporting her husband\u201d. \u201cWhile Israel does not intend to respond in detail at this time regarding the accusations thrown at him or his family he wants it known that these attacks have hardened his resolve,\u201d the spokesman said. GoFundMe Australia removed the crowdfunding page on Monday. \u201cAs a company, we are absolutely committed to the fight for equality for LGBTIQ+ people and fostering an environment of inclusivity,\u201d its manager, Nicola Britton, said. Rugby Australia\u2019s chief executive, Raelene Castle, said: \u201cFrom our perspective [GoFundMe] is a place where sick children get support, so it\u2019s certainly not a strategy we think is appropriate.\u201d The controversy has also extended to Folau\u2019s wife, Maria, who plays netball for the Adelaide Thunderbirds. She reposted her husband\u2019s GoFundMeCampaign on social media. \u201cWhile Netball SA in no way endorses the reposting, we do not believe Maria has contravened our social media policy,\u201d Netball South Australia\u2019s chief executive, Bronwyn Klei said in a statement. \u201cMaria is a key member of the Thunderbirds. Not only has she provided great strength and leadership on court, she attends and works with netballing clinics, spends a lot of time with fans, engages with local communities and passionately encourages young kids with their netball dreams. We continue to support her as we support all our players.\u201d Klei clarified her organisation does not endorse the repost and is committed to diversity and inclusion. Netball great Liz Ellis was furious with the code\u2019s response. \u201cAs much as I love watching \u2066Maria Folau play netball I do not want my sport endorsing the views of her husband,\u201d Ellis tweeted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
