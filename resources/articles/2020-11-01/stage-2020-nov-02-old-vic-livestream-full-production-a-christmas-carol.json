The show, with a cast of 18, will play to an empty theatre for 16 performances in the run-up to Christmas. It will be offered free to care homes across the UK and local schools. For everyone else, 5,000 tickets for each performance will be offered. Given the scale of the show, theatre bosses say they do not expect to make a profit. In total, the production will employ 80 freelance creatives, actors and musicians, all of whom will have to be socially distanced, meaning \u201ca level of technical and creative complication which is mind-blowing, really,\u201d said Matthew Warchus, the theatre\u2019s artistic director. The performing arts continue to be one of the sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, with arts organisations coming up with innovative ways to stay creative. For the Old Vic that has meant staging plays in an empty theatre and streaming them via Zoom to audiences in their homes so the thrill of the live experience remains. So far the In Camera series has comprised small-scale plays with no set and small casts such as Claire Foy and Matt Smith in Lungs; Andrew Scott in Three Kings, and Michael Sheen, Indira Varma and David Threlfall in Faith Healer. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing that without any prior experience of how to do it, using our own in-house staff,\u201d said Warchus. \u201cIt has been a real challenge and a learning experience for us, technically and creatively, but it has been done so far on a small scale. This is a huge step up.\u201d Warchus will direct a full production of Jack Thorne\u2019s A Christmas Carol with a set, costumes, theatrical lighting and live musicians. The Old Vic is confident of staging the show, between 12 and 24 December, despite the government\u2019s announcement of a new lockdown in England. Theatres in England that had just began to reopen will have to close again, bringing further losses of income and pushing some closer to the edge. Creative freelance workers, many of whom have fallen through the gaps of government support schemes, will be among the hardest hit. Paul W Fleming, the general secretary of Equity, called it a \u201cbody blow\u201d and said his union\u2019s members would have felt a mixture of \u201crage and confusion\u201d after Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference. Jon Morgan, the director of the Theatres Trust, said he was seeking \u201curgent clarification\u201d on whether rehearsals could go ahead to allow the many pantos and Christmas shows that are being planned. The Old Vic\u2019s previous In Camera shows have sold 1,000 tickets to replicate the theatre\u2019s capacity but this will be increased to 5,000 per performance. \u201cTicket sales are crucial. It is not going to be easy for this production to make a profit at all.\u201d Warchus said he was approached over the summer by a number of actors, including Lincoln, asking how they could help the theatre, which was in a particularly perilous place because it gets no public subsidy. The theatre received \u00a33m as part of the government\u2019s \u00a31.57bn cultural recovery fund providing cash to allow arts organisations to survive until the spring. \u201cThat was a massive relief,\u201d said Warchus. \u201cThings would have looked very grim for us if that money had not come through. It is a lifeline and keeps the creative pulse going.\u201d What happens after the spring is as much an unknown for the Old Vic as it is for everyone else in the world. \u201cWe are used in theatre to thinking on our feet, having a kind of improvisatory response to things,\u201d said Warchus. \u201cWe\u2019re used to a press night looming and the leading actor becoming ill or scenery breaking down mid-performance \u2026 our general day-to-day in normal circumstances are fraught with unexpected twists and turns. \u201cBut this year has been \u2026 obviously challenging. It has taken that ability to cope and put it under a lot of strain. We\u2019ve got unknown unknowns, not the known unknowns. It is an impossible situation and like every theatre we have multiple models running of what we might be doing in the next 12 months.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
