Speaking to the press on Friday, with the hammer of impeachment poised to fall and countless domestic and international crises to consider, Donald Trump took on a pressing enemy: poor water pressure caused by conservation laws. \u201cPeople are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times as opposed to once. They end up using more water,\u201d Trump said while talking with business owners about what he called \u2018\u2018commonsense\u201d steps to end overregulation. The government, Trump said, was investigating: \u201cWe\u2019re looking very strongly at sinks and showers,\u201d he said, prompting listeners to picture him staring as hard as he could at a tap. Trump announced on Friday he had issued an order to review water-saving regulations for various bathroom facilities. Use of low-flush toilets started in the 1990s after President George HW Bush signed the Energy Policy Act. The 1992 law said new toilets could use no more than 1.6 gallons of water per flush. The law went into effect in 1994 for residential buildings and 1997 for commercial structures. \u201cYou go into a new building, a new house or a new home and they have standards and you don\u2019t get water,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou can\u2019t wash your hands practically, there\u2019s so little water that comes out of the faucet. And the end result is you leave the faucet on and it takes you so much longer to wash your hands and you end up using the same amount of water.\u201d Trump said relaxing water-conservation standards might not be practical in some arid regions of the nation, but he claimed in many states, there is plenty of water. \u2018\u2018It comes down. It\u2019s called rain,\u201d he said. But, as so often with Trump, the solution isn\u2019t so simple: as Bloomberg reported, a 2014 Government Accountability Office report found 40 of 50 state water managers feared water shortages in their states during the next decade. Yes, water is known to fall from the sky. That doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t conserve it.
