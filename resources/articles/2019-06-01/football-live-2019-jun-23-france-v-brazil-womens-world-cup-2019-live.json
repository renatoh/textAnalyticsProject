I am off to sleep now. The match report is coming your way ... France will play Spain or USA in the quarter-finals. In truth, France just about edged it but there wasn\u2019t much in it. It\u2019s good to have the hosts going deep into the tournament and they\u2019ll be there on merit. 120 mins: Two minutes added on. 118 mins: Majri goes down with cramp. Top timewasting. Karchouai replaces her. 116 mins: Brazil are struggling to find enough energy to get a crucial equaliser. 114 mins: Diani almost seals France\u2019s progression. She bursts into the box and fires a shot towards the top corner but Barbara palms it wide, not that the officials spot it. Peter Oh says: \u201cIf this score holds (I have family in Brazil watching, so I do not want it to hold), it will be a Henry with a decisive France goal to knock Brazil out of the World Cup. Like in the men\u2019s tournament in 2006. I\u2019m still mad at Roberto Carlos for pulling up his socks instead of marking Thierry Henry.\u201d 112 mins: The France fans are trying to keep their players running with a slow hand, Icelandic clap. 110 mins: A lot of tired limbs out there ... 108 mins: Can Brazil bounce back from this? Diani wins a free-kick on the right. Majri whips it in for players to attack and Henry is the one who gets on the end of it and diverts the ball home from six yards. More football. I am about to enter my eighth straight hour of MBMing. I might be delirious about VAR. We are heading for penalties, aren\u2019t we? 105 mins: What a clearance! Debinha breaks the offside trap, gets into the box and toe pokes the ball beyond the \u2018keeper but Mbock Bathy Nka sees where it is going and clears it off the line. 104 mins: A corner is lifted onto Diani\u2019s head who powers an effort towards goal but it\u2019s straight at Barbara. 102 mins: France have a free-kick in a dangerous position but Majri sends it straight out for a goal kick. Ruth Purdie wants a red for Geyse: \u201cThat\u2019s a red card there Will. She knew what she was doing and left her foot in there.\u201d 100 mins: Thiney lifts a corner beyond the back post which Henry sends back into danger but no one in a white shirt can get a crucial final touch and it bounces behind. 98 mins: A ball is lifted over the France defence for Geyse to chase. The substitute is quick but the goalkeeper gets there first to claim, although the Brazilian catches Bouhaddi and she requires treatment. 96 mins: Cristiane is carried off. Good work by Majri on the left results in her lifting a cross to the back post but the ball bounces kindly for the Brazil defence who clear. 94 mins: Cristiane tries to shoot from downtown but the effort of whacking it from the halfway has knacked her hamstring. She is down and not getting up anytime soon. Needless to say, she didn\u2019t score. 92 mins: A quiet start to extra-time. I have been reminded of my Tony Cascarino anecdote, though, so will tell that at the end of the game. Jeremy Hurley has some advice for us all: \u201cPeople have such short memories if all the dodgy goals that were given before the introduction of VAR. Its like reading an echo chamber, VAR VAr Var var va v.......watch the game and stop moaning.\u201d Thirty minutes more you say? Justin Kavanagh on VAR: \u201cThe future of football might involve an offside official whose only purpose will be to deliver the bad news to the players that the VAR lads have found the striker to be offside\u2026again. If this newfangled VAR stuff had been around in Filippo Inzaghi\u2019s day, every game would have taken about four hours.\u201d I\u2019d hope not but England wouldn\u2019t scare me at the moment. Extra-time is required. Mine\u2019s a pint. 90+4 mins: Debinha gets the ball into the box to Beatriz who stretches to shoot but she cannot control the shot and it flies wide. 90+2 mins: Gauvin chases the ball into the channel but her cross into the box is snaffled by Barbara. Marta tries to get away from Henry but the France skipper stops that with a tap on the ankle. 90 mins: Five minutes added on. Toby Rutland is in: \u201cI\u2019ll join you and Paul Connoly for that pint, and would argue that the referee thought that could have been a penalty but bottled it and waited to see what the VAR said. She even stopped play for the Brazilian defender who was not at all injured, was that to give the VAR guys some more time?? Var worked well for the Brazil goal tbf\u201d I think anyone could have spotted the offside without the use of cameras. 89 mins: A deep cross is headed on by defender Diani and lands at Marta\u2019s feet but she fails to get a shot away before being closed down. Mary Waltz says: \u201cWell, my pre game and half time predictions were completely off the mark. But in the grand tradition of our current political leaders I will reject responsibility for my words and blame it all on the EU, fake news, and the French measles style kit.\u201d 87 mins: NO GOAL! The ball is played through to Tamires who is an acre of space. She has so much space for a reason: she is a mile offside. Regardless she puts the ball in the back of the net and celebrates before the flag goes up. VAR confirms it very quickly, which shows how far off she was. 85 mins: Cristiane\u2019s quick feet gets her beyond Diani who gains revenge by taking her down. Andressinha whacks the free-kick but it bounces perfectly for the \u2018keeper to take. 83 mins: Beatriz cuts across Torrent and gets booked. 80 mins: Santos gets done by Le Sommer on the left and then cleans her out as she gives away the foul. She is not booked but does end up with cramp. Bussaglia\u2019s free-kick lands in the \u2018keeper\u2019s hands. 78 mins: Henry spins away from a defender with ease but her cross is too close to Barbara who still requires two attempts to claim the ball. 76 mins: Paul Connolly agrees with me, let\u2019s go for a pint: \u201cI\u2019d support your argument in the 70th minute. Katheleen went right through Gauvin\u2019s back. \u201cI must say I\u2019m disappointed by the quality of refereeing in this tournament.\u201d 74 mins: Diani puts the ball past Tamires who then takes her down but the referee adjudges it not to be a foul. Down the other end Debinha whacks a low drive from 20 yards but it\u2019s straight down the \u2018keeper\u2019s throat. Paul Rhys emails: \u201cSo a great goal from Brazil gets all the excitement sucked out of it by a VAR call. Yes it went in their favour...but is the line-o more inclined to raise her flag, \u201cjust to be safe\u201d, because she knows she has VAR as a safety net? It was a clear no-interference offside. The whole system is making me want to stop watching the top competitions because even the threat of VAR robs goals of that joyous, unadulterated outburst of emotion.\u201d 72 mins: The free-kick is lifted to the edge of the six-yard box where Le Sommer misjudges it and heads wide when completely free. She might have been a few inches offside, anyway. 70 mins: Katheleen goes down with a sore shoulder after challenging Gauvin in the box for a header but gets nowhere near it. I would argue it\u2019s a foul ... but no one else does. Diani breaks through a couple of challenges but Formiga then just cuts her down in full flow. Needless to say, she is booked. 68 mins: The fans are keeping the France players going but some are looking a little tired here. 66 mins: Majri tries to send in a cross but Santos gets in her way to stop it. A cross from the left is pulled back into the path of Thaisa who angles a shot into the bottom corner but the referee rules it out, claiming Devinha was offside before receiving the ball. The forward was definitely onside and it goes upstairs for the video guys to confirm it is a goal. 62 mins: Le Sommer picks up the ball on the left, cuts into the box and fires a wicked shot at goal but it smashes into teammates Gauvin and flies wide. It looked like that was set for the bottom corner, too. The referee was not ranked ... 60 mins: All pretty quiet in Le Havre at the moment. 58 mins: Sorry, I lied. Bouhaddi tipped the header onto the bar. Please accept apologies as it was a great save. France send in a corner which Barbara comes to get but is nowhere to be seen as it flies over her head. Renard gets a touch on it but not in the right direction and Brazil clear. 56 mins: OFF THE BAR! Marta swings in a free-kick from the left, which Cristiane rises highest to head towards goal but the ball bounces off the crossbar with Bouhaddi helpless. Hubert offers his VAR rules: I\u2019ve finally made my mind up about VAR. I hate it. I hate it unless three specific rules changes come in with it: A handball in the box is only a penalty if the contact is made from a ball struck &gt; 5 feet from the defender\u2019s hand. Offside is only awarded when a majority of an offensive player\u2019s body is ahead of the last defender\u2019s body part closest to the goal Keepers are allowed a one meter line/box in which to move on a penalty. A keeper has to be allowed to make a slight step in order to cover the corners. One cannot leap from a standing stop to either post. Try it sometime. You can with a cross-step but there is no time for a cross-step 54 mins: Le Havre is bouncing as the fans celebrate the goal and the fact we weren\u2019t put through the trauma of VAR once more. Stunning work from Diani down the right flank and she leaves the full-back to eat dust thanks to a quick turn coupled with pace before putting in a perfect, low cross for Gauvin to slide in. No need for VAR here. 51 mins: Asseyi drives across the pitch, taking a couple of Brazilians out of the game before laying it off to Le Sommer who slices the ball wide. USA take on Spain in the last 16 ... 49 mins: Marta chips a free-kick into the box but a French defender comes out on top to head clear. Earlier Varce 47 mins: A lovely turn from Le Sommer but that\u2019s about it so far. Peep! Peep! Peep! Another 45 minutes of football versus VAR awaits. Jacqui Oatley says ... Not for me, Clive. Cnoyes says: \u201cWas it just my lying eyes or were Brazil the better team in that opening half? Controlling the tempo of the game beautifully with tough play and careful passing in midfield. Did France end that half without a single meaningful shot on goal? So much for tipping them as favourites.\u201d I am not sure they are controlling it but they are certainly stopping France from getting going. Half-time reading from Rob Marriott: \u201cQuite apart from whether or not the decisions are right, it\u2019s become increasingly frustrating to see the referee summoned to a screen - after the fully-qualified refs with the dozen monitors have tried to reach a decision - almost every time. I\u2019m sure that VAR wasn\u2019t originally intended to work that way, that involving the on field ref was supposed to be an occasional last resort, and I\u2019m also fairly sure that it was indeed only occasional when the technology first came in. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any other sport that takes this approach. Normally, you\u2019d either have the video official make the decision, or you give the on field official immediate access to a screen. But Fifa, for reasons known only to themselves, have created an unnecessary two-stage system which only serves to add an extra two or three minutes to every controversial moment (as well as ending up with a decision being made from only one screen, inside the ground, which completely goes against the principle of having a bank of monitors in a separate quiet location). \u201cIf it was all dealt with more promptly, more logically, I feel there\u2019d be a fair bit less anger, even with the odd dubious result. Nobody enjoys the endless waiting.\u201d Ruth Purdue offers some analysis: \u201cBrazil are fouling like City do. Do it before the brilliant French attack can get any fluency. \u201cIn other new Marta needs to take fewer touches and play quicker. She has runner ahead of her everytime.\u201d VAR VAR VAR VAR VAR VAR VAR VAR VAR VAR. Still goalless. 45+4 mins: Majri gets the ball in space on the edge of the area but rushes her shot and smashes it high and wide. Abhijato Sensarma says: \u201cI hence declare that every goal scored is a \u2018Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Goal\u2019 in a football match involving VAR. The goal has been scored and not been scored simultaneously; it remains in this dual state until the referee - the ultimate observer on the field - has made his decision. At this point, the goal enters a singular state of existence - it either existed, or never did, even though it certainly did as well as did not before the observation was made in the reality of all others. \u201cVAR decisions boggle the mind, boggle the spirit, and transcend logic. Do I dare say these decision make sense yet don\u2019t simultaneously?\u201d 45+2 mins: Tamires is booked for a cynical challenge, wrapping her legs around Asseyi despite already being on the floor. Matt Cast makes a bold claim: \u201cThis is a really cynical performance from Brazil in terms of fouls and making the most of any contact. I think they\u2019ve now committed more fouls than Cameroon did in the first half v England...\u201d 45 mins: Six minutes added on. Cheers VAR. Scott Bassett has a solution: \u201cThat was a 50:50 for me. The keeper definitely did not have control. Maybe the striker\u2019s hand touched the ball as it was bundled in but it\u2019s another case of \u201cunnatural position suspicion,\u201d which leads me to the question, what exactly is the law and what is the current guidance on how to apply it? Answer: who the eff knows anymore? It was extremely harsh to disallow that. The only answer seems to be detachable arms.\u201d 44 mins: Cristiane breaks into the box from the left, shooting from a tight angle, with the shot repelled by the \u2018keeper\u2019s feet. Bouhaddi comes to claim the corner but is given a free-kick after the dropping the ball without really being under pressure. Maybe the referee is just soft on goalkeepers. David Wall emails: \u201cThat\u2019s a good point (32 minutes), i think the issue has always been that the officials in particular games weren\u2019t/ aren\u2019t good enough (however high the general standard is). It was Frank Lampard\u2019s no -given goal against Germany in 2010 that convinced Blatter to accept goal-line technology, but how the linesman on the day missed that was the real issue. It was so far over you could probably have seen it clearly in from the very back row at the other end of the stadium. That\u2019s not to criticise goal-line technology, that has been a quick, decisive, and good addition. But other terrible mistake that really should have been spotted by the match officials just falling well below the required standards have led to the call for VAR. Supposedly it\u2019s to correct the clear and obvious error, the howler (like the DRS in cricket was originally meant to do). But that is just making up for officials failing to perform. A better, easier solution is to put more money and resources into training more, better officials.\u201d 42 mins: Fouls all over the shop here. Not much football in between. More actual reason: 40 mins: Drew Goldie brings reason: \u201cA few years ago a penalty was awarded against a goalkeeper who saved a shot in a one-on-one, but it was deemed a foul because he had followed through and smacked into the centre forward. Even though he\u2019d got his shot away and wasn\u2019t impeded in the slightest. \u201cThis one presumably was chalked off because the French player\u2019s challenge followed through on the goalkeeper, and the goalie fluffing it isn\u2019t relevant. \u201cIt\u2019s the rules that are daft, more than VAR. At least, I think that\u2019s what just happened.\u201d 38 mins: Marta does her best to outfox Torrent but the France defender sticks to her task and puts the ball out for a corner. Marta takes the corner and finds Cristiane whose header loops into the goalkeeper\u2019s hands. 36 mins: Renard goes into the book for a challenge on Devinha. The French centre-back caught her on the knee with studs, which is not great. The Brazil players were asking for a card from the start and got their wish quite quickly. Toby Rutland is not happy: \u201cWhy am I sending this? Why do I care? I have no interest in this game, it\u2019s on in the background. Yet I need to get off my chest how angry I am with Fifa and the plastic officials in their stupid studio, disallowing perfectly good goals (or allowing obviously offside goals) and ruining football.\u201d 34 mins: Tamires sends a pass through but Bouhaddi is quickly off her line and clears the immediate danger before Brazil are penalised for an offside. I think it was a 50:50 and the forward won it. But who knows anymore? Others think the issue was a handball so it certainly isn\u2019t clear. 32 mins: Is the issue that officials just aren\u2019t good enough? Have they not been trained sufficiently? Barbara now being booed by the home fans, one assumes that she invented VAR. Lourens van Krimpen says: \u201cVAR is the end of the enjoyment of the game. If this goes on like this lots of people will turn their back. I for one am on the verge.\u201d 30 mins: I still do not know what the goal was disallowed for. This is just silly now. Still scrappy on the pitch. David Wall emails: \u201cEveryone seems to be anticipating a France - USA quarter final after their respective last 16 games and it\u2019s true that would be a super match up, but isn\u2019t that an extreme case of premature chicken counting? Both Brazil and Spain are pretty decent sides, well capable of upsetting the odds, so you could very plausibly see one or both of the favourites miss out. As i write this France have just scored but there is still a way to go.\u201d 28 mins: VARCE. This is idiotic, no? 26 mins: The goal goes to VAR. The claim is Gauvin took the ball out of Barbara\u2019s hands but the goalkeeper certainly did not have control of the ball when it hit the France player. If this is overturned we should end it all. Oh, it is disallowed. This is silly. The ball ends up in the back of the net after a cross from Diani on the right bounces off the Gauvin\u2019s and into the back of the net. Barbara came to get it but did not claim it. Both \u2018keeper and scorer end up on the floor in pain but that is the opening goal as the celebrating France players prove. Oh but it is not. 22 mins: A little bit scrappy at the moment in Le Havre. Plenty of intent but just lacking a touch of quality. 20 mins: There is a good tempo to this game but still waiting for any real moments of quality. 18 mins: Mary Waltz on kits: \u201cThe answer to the question on France\u2019s bizarre kit design. The designer is obviously an anti-vaxer sending out a message to their fellow travellers.\u201d 16 mins: Debinha cuts in from the left and drills a shot from 20 yards but it\u2019s diverted wide by a defender in white. Marta swings in the cross but the goalkeeper does well to cling on when under pressure in the box. Hubert\u2019s been in touch: \u201cI know this puts me in the minority but for the life of me I can\u2019t reason why. Brazil, to my eye, are vastly superior to France save for the dubious edge of home field. I\u2019m not a gambling man (hence the roof over my head) but I\u2019d take Brazil minus 1.5 goals without a slightest shiver of doubt.\u201d 14 mins: Henry aims a cross into the box but it\u2019s deflected straight to Barbara in the Brazil. 12 mins: A free-kick 30 yards fro goal is laid off to Henry who thwacks well over the bar. Charles Antaki asks: \u201cThe football looks good already but in the early stages, trivia worries come to the fore: if Brazil are in first choice strip, why not the blue shorts and white socks? And why are France in shirts that, in close-up, look like a 12-year old\u2019s pyjamas?\u201d Sell more kits? 10 mins: Marta gains control of the ball 25 yards from goal, wriggles through a couple of defenders to earn enough space to fire a shot off but she drags it wide from the edge of the box. 8 mins: Brazil dive into a few last-ditch tackles to stop France making it into the box and then clear the pressure. France looking the more confident side early on. 6 mins: Henry does well to dispossess the full-back in the corner and wins another set-piece when her latest cross is turned behind. Barbara fists it to the edge of her own box. She is looking to dominate the box tonight. 4 mins: Henry earns a corner for France after he cross on the turn is deflected out. Barbara comes to claim the corner and gathers the ball at the second time of acting. 2 mins: Plenty of clapping in the stands from the home fans but not much happening on the pitch. Let\u2019s get ready to rumble! The anthems are done and dusted and we\u2019re pretty much ready to go. Abhijato Sensarma asks: (1) Who is the favourite today according to you and/or most pundits? Alex Scott. (2) Is VAR winning the Golden Boot this year? Probably (3) Have your fingers not suffered enough? Yes Hope Solo on pressure ... This game is live on BBC Four which means it\u2019s a high brow, cultural experience. Do you take requests? Silly rules. If this game is anything about England v Cameroon then I might not survive the night. Let\u2019s hope for a nice 2-0 win. Mary Waltz emails: \u201cFrance has the depth of quality that should overwhelm Brazil. Can Marta discover the fountain of youth and pretend that it\u2019s 20010 and upset mighty Le Bleu? Should be fun.\u201d I just did the MBM on this madness, too ... Not a great omen ... A bit on the France coach ... France: Bouhaddi, Renard, Torrent, Henry, Le Sommer, Majri, Diani, Gauvin, Bussaglia, Asseyi, Mbock Bathy Nka Brazil: Barbara, Thaisa, Tamires, Formiga, Debinha, Marta, Cristiane, L Santos, Kathellen, Ludmila, Monica Good evening! The hosts are looking to take one step closer to achieving the dream of winning their own tournament. They picked up maximum points in the group, with a little helping hand from VAR but they will be rightly confident heading into this game. Brazil won two out of three in their group, losing a dramatic game to Australia in between. Their results saw them finish only third, which they will not have enjoyed considering the opposition. They possess Marta, who is back fit and makes a huge difference to the Brazil side. Will France fall to the Brazilians? It will be fascinating to find out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
