Although Wahaca later decided against doing so \u2013 blaming the incident on an \u201cinternal communications issue\u201d and amending its eat-and-run policy \u2013 it shows that service-industry workers have got it bad. The Guardian asked readers for their experiences. Here are some of the most egregious responses, which have been published anonymously at their request. Responding via a Guardian callout: \u2018He told me I had to pay the table\u2019s bill or I couldn\u2019t leave\u2019 Late 2017. I was new at TGI Fridays and had my first runners. They\u2019d been a nice enough table, but they\u2019d been angry at the long wait for food and then, when it came, the food itself. That was a regular thing. At the end of the night, I was cashing out and one of my managers came over to discuss the run. His management style was horrid \u2013 putting people down, patronising them, goading them in front of customers \u2013 and he hated me. He told me it was my fault and I had to pay the table\u2019s bill or I wouldn\u2019t be able to leave the restaurant. I voiced my disapproval, but he stood his ground and so I began to count the \u00a370 bill out of my tips and own money. It was only when another manager intervened and spoke to the first manager and said that wasn\u2019t store policy that I realised I was being bullied. 22-year-old man, London \u2018I had to mop up a pool of a blood with one-ply tissue\u2019 I worked part-time in a restaurant while studying in college. The manager took a strong dislike to me because I was a little bit less experienced than the other waiting staff. On a particularly busy night, I heard him scream at me from across the restaurant \u2013 a drunk man had fallen from his stool and hit his head and split his lip open. Blood was everywhere, and my manager told me to clean it up. When I asked for gloves and a mop he gestured to some kitchen towel before disappearing behind the bar downstairs. Naively, I did it, as I didn\u2019t want to lose my job. I had to mop up a pool of this drunk old man\u2019s blood with one-ply tissue, on my hands and knees, in a busy restaurant. It was humiliating and I only realised how dangerous it was when a man who was drinking there approached me, told me he was a nurse and warned me to never let them make me do something like this again. I quit soon afterwards, but it haunts me to this day. 23-year-old woman, Dublin \u2018She told me I needed to be prettier to be such a bad waitress\u2019 During university, I worked at a small independent restaurant in south London. On one Sunday I had a customer who insisted on being seated in the closed part of the restaurant and then called me incompetent because I had to set up the table. She was a nightmare for the entire meal. By the time dessert came round, she had told me multiple times I needed to be far prettier if I expected to be such a bad waitress and still wanted a tip. I brought the desserts for her and her two male companions up a rickety staircase and she asked for dessert forks. I didn\u2019t think we had any, but offered to check our own cutlery and with the restaurant next door. I had to inform her there were none available and she pushed the table away from her, got up and swore into my face, asking me how it felt to be \u201cstupid and incompetent\u201d, then giggled with her friends. She tried to get the dessert taken off her bill because she couldn\u2019t eat cheesecake with a normal fork and, shockingly, didn\u2019t leave a tip. Curiously, she returned multiple times, though. This restaurant also tried to get away with not paying me the minimum wage for a 21-year-old because \u201cI had already signed a contract\u201d when I was under 21. 26-year-old woman, Wakefield \u2018He was very distressed that we had run out of vinegar packets\u2019 I worked in a fast-food restaurant at a tourist attraction. One busy summer day we ran out of tiny vinegar packets. One smartly dressed gentleman was very distressed by this, becoming extremely passive aggressive and holding up the queue with a monologue about how much he had paid to get in and expected everything to be \u201cjust so\u201d. About four hours later, as I was cleaning a table, I realised someone was standing next to me. I looked up to see the same man from before, holding a single vinegar packet between thumb and forefinger. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d bring this to you from the [restaurant in other part of attraction]. You know,\u201d he placed it on the table as if it were the golden idol from the first Indiana Jones film, \u201cin case someone asks. 26-year-old woman, Edinburgh \u2018Only female staff were asked to do cleanup\u2019 Working at a hotel in 2011: my tips were kept by management, a male manager kept calling me \u201cgood girl\u201d, only female staff were asked to do \u201ccleanup\u201d, and one set of customers asked me if I \u201cknew the difference between France and England\u201d. When I asked why, they said: \u201cHad you known, you wouldn\u2019t have brought me French [mustard] when I asked for English.\u201d I lasted two months before I was sacked and evicted (I lived on the premises) on Christmas Eve. I had been in the country for only three months at that point. 35-year-old-woman, London \u2018Dishes had names like Good Girl or Bad Boy breakfast\u2019 Last year, I was working in a brand new pub. It was modern, well decorated and seemed like a really nice place. The issue was the clear sexism of the place. There were neon signs that said things such as \u201ckissable lips\u201d, \u201csexy face\u201d and \u201cglamorous girl\u201d, as well as dishes with names like Good Girl or Bad Boy breakfast, Naked, Dressed or Topless burgers. To make things even worst, it was a sports pub. The amount of shaming comments female waitresses and myself experienced every day from clients, because of the name of dishes, was absurd \u2013 from \u201cI\u2019d rather my waitress was topless\u201d to \u201cAre you a good girl?\u201d I had no chance to defend myself as they were my clients. I couldn\u2019t get out of that place any quicker. 20-year-old woman, London \u2018Inside the empty crisp packet was an overfull nappy\u2019 In the summer of 2014, I waited tables at a zoo restaurant. I will never forget serving one demanding table of two young families who had been incredibly demanding and complained about a range of issues \u2013 mainly the price \u2013 throughout their meal. After they exited I loaded up the rubbish on to a tray and, just as I was about to carry it all to the kitchen, a bag of crisps fell on to the floor. I bent down to pick it up and quickly realised that inside the bag was a warm, overfull nappy and a note saying \u201cThank you\u201d accompanied by a smiley face. 25-year-old, Norwich \u2018They repeatedly pushed glasses off the table\u2019 When I was working at a popular Italian pizza chain in London, on one occasion, a group came in, extremely drunk and obnoxious from the start. They carried on drinking and, after they repeatedly pushed glasses off the table, causing them to smash, we told them we would not be serving any more wine until they had finished their meal. They swore at my manager and told us all that we couldn\u2019t tell them what they can and can\u2019t do because they were 25, work really hard in the week and deserve to get drunk at the weekend. Every waiter in the restaurant at that point was doing a 12-hour shift. 27-year-old man, London Responding via Twitter: \u201cA customer gave me a \u00a310 tip, which I was initially thrilled with. He then told me that when he eats out he \u2018starts at \u00a320 and deducts \u00a31 per slip-up\u2019. My 10 \u2018slip ups\u2019 ranged from the food taking 12 minutes to come to the stitching on my apron being frayed \u2026\u201d \u201cAfter my bar hit a certain head count, we had to switch to plastic cups for safety reasons. When I handed a man his pint of lager in a plastic cup he spat at me and called me a bitch. I walked off to tell my manager expecting a short break to cry in the bathroom, but he instead made me go back to the bar and apologise to the man.\u201d \u201cWe were filmed constantly. The owner was completely open about the fact that he, his wife and their adult daughter would watch the footage in real time at their house and ring in to question micro-decisions we made throughout the evening (\u2018Why did you just fill up his water glass? I hope you pushed the expensive wine before serving them the house just then\u2019).\u201d \u201cThere was a colleague who used to pick their nose and wipe the contents on the bathroom wall. It was once my job to scrape them off with a knife into some tissue.\u201d \u201cWhen I was a teenage waitress, the tricky, \u2018charismatic\u2019 gentleman who had been celebrating his 80th birthday went to kiss my hand at the end of the meal. He then sucked several of my fingers before I could shriek, \u2018They need me in the kitchen!\u2019 \u201cWhen it came to settling the bill, the customer I was serving said: \u2018Girls always come running when there\u2019s money involved\u2019, then screwed up the bank notes and threw them at me.\u201d \u201cWhen I was 15, I worked in a cafe. A woman carefully brought her tray back to me. \u2018How rare! What a thoughtful gesture!\u2019 I thought. Her child had puked all over it, so she was bringing it to me to clean.\u201d \u201cI worked in a restaurant in a hotel. One of the chefs had an aneurysm and died when he went to find something in the fridge. The owners insisted that dinner service continue, and that his body be taken out to the ambulance through the back entrance, by the bins.\u201d \u201cAs the only English woman working in an Italian restaurant, I was subject to some low-level sexual harassment. When I complained, I was told not to be so English about things.\u201d \u201cA while back we hosted a work party. After the party, I was clearing up and saw a water jug underneath the table, hidden out of sight with a weird substance in. I picked it up and sniffed it. It was someone\u2019s vomit, and I almost vomited myself. So I never sniff anything that looks weird now.\u201d \u201cGirls weren\u2019t allowed to take orders, deliver savoury food or accept tips. We were only allowed to clear tables, bring drinks and deal with desserts.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
