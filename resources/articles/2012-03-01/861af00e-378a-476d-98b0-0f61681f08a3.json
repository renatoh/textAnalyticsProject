Big matches in every English division plus noteworthy action from Italy and Spain, and all of this on the day that Bursassport beat Bugsasspor 2-0 in Turkey's teams-whose-names-are-almost-the-same derby. Here are just a few of the highlights: Premier League: Sunderland beat Blackburn in Martin O'Neill's first game in charge. Sunderland are without the injured Kieran Richardson and the suspended St\u00e9phane Sessegnon and Lee Cattermole. Championship: Reading could top the table tonight. The rampaging Royals have won nine of their last 10 games and visit Peterborough, while current leaders Southampton face a testy trip to seventh-placed Hull. A draw would be enough (subject to Reading not going totally goal-crazy) to guarantee that the Saints cling on to top spot and seems quite a likely outcome: Hull have drawn six of their last seven. West Ham v Middlesbrough is also quite important. League One: Sixth-placed Notts County play their second Sheffield side in three days \u2013 having lost to Wednesday on Saturday they host United tonight. Meanwhile, Charlton's mini-wobble will could be extended by in-form Yeovil. League Two: It's first against second as Swindon host Torquay, who have won seven of their last eight games. At the other end of the table, Barnet v Dagenham &amp; Redbridge has the air of a relegation six-pointer. Spain: Lionel Messicould become Barcelona's all-time greatest goalscorer tonight, when Granada come to Camp Nou. It was thought that Cesar Rodriguez had scored 235 goals for the club, but an in-depth investigation into the club's statistical records from the 1950s has led to his tally being reduced by three. Messi is currently on 231, and surely need only tie up his laces to be guaranteed at least a brace tonight. \"It's worth noting that Cesar Rodriguez is the club's all-time top goalscorer in official matches, but the absolute record belongs to Paulino Alcantara, who scored 369 goals in 357 official and friendly matches,\" Barcelona note. Italy: Milan head to Turin for the second leg of their Coppa Italia semi-final against Juventus trailing 2-1 from the first meeting last month. The Juve coach, Antonio Conte, says it's \"the most important match of the season\", though that hasn't stopped him from leaving Gianluigi Buffon at home. Marco Storari will play in nets, while Alessandro Del Piero is to start up front. Music news now! Here's a cross-dressing bearded man called Tom coming second in the race to represent Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest. And here's someone playing Adele's Rolling in the Deep on a guzheng (that's a Chinese zither). 7.26pm: Hello world! I'm here, and so's this pretty clever bit of Eminem-based Mitt Romney satire. And so are tonight's Premier League teams: Blackburn: Robinson, Lowe, Dann, Hanley, Martin Olsson, Nzonzi, Pedersen, Formica, Hoilett, Marcus Olsson, Yakubu. Subs: Bunn, Givet, Dunn, Modeste, Petrovic, Orr, Goodwillie. Sunderland: Mignolet, Bardsley, Kyrgiakos, Turner, Bridge, Larsson, Gardner, Vaughan, McClean, Bendtner, Campbell. Subs: Gordon, Wickham, Kilgallon, Colback, Ji, Meyler, Elmohamady. Referee: Martin Atkinson. 7.36pm: Right, I've set up the screen next to mine to show me as much football as physically possible, and my ettention is now all yours. As are the West Ham v Middlesbrough teams: West Ham: Green, O'Brien, Faye, Collins, McCartney, Noble, Tomkins, Nolan, Cole, Maynard, Taylor. Subs: Baldock, Collison, Carew, Lansbury, Morrison. Middlesbrough: Steele, Hoyte, Bates, Hines, Bennett, Thomson, Smallwood, Bailey, Emnes, Jutkiewicz, Hammill. Subs: Zemmama, Ogbeche, Arca, Martin, McMahon. Referee: Scott Mathieson. 7.42pm: \"Is it sacrilege to observe that Strorari is the better of J*ve's goalkeepers so it is appropriate for him to play in the cup semi-final,\" ponders Lou Roper. Not to me. \"And your preview neglected to note that it is 5 v 2 in the Scottish First Division (Hamilton Accies v Dundee), an oversight I am sure you are most keen to correct at the first opportunity!\" I'll let you do it for me, if you don't mind. 7.44pm: \"You seem to have forgotten that there is also football on in Germany: the DFB Pokal (German Cup) semi-final between second division leaders Greuther F\u00fcrth and first division leaders Borussia Dortmund has just started,\" writes Sebastian Welton, \"although I think the more interesting game is tomorrow between Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Bayern M\u00fcnchen (who have been beaten twice by them so far this season.)\" I didn't forget about it, I just didn't get immediately excited about it. The screen to my right could possibly handle one more game; I'll sort. 7.46pm: Stat of the day, from (inevitably) @OptaJoe on Twitter: 25% - Blackburn's Paul Robinson has the lowest pass completion of any player in the top five European leagues this season. 7.47pm: Kick-off! The match in Turin is already a minute old as the whistle blows at Upton Park. 7.49pm: First goal of the day award: Shrewsbury 1 (Nicky Wroe 1) Cheltenham 0! 7.55pm: Leeds have taken an early lead against Nottingham Forest \u2013 who apparently missed a decent first-minute chance \u2013 through Robert Snodgrass's sixth-minute penalty. 7.56pm: And Forest have equalised! Adlene Guedioura with a long-range snorter. Further good news for Forest \u2013 it's Doncaster 0 Millwall 1. 8.01pm: Further adventures in the Championship drop-zone: it's now Doncaster 0 Millwall 2, Harry Kane having extended the Lions' lead, while Nikola Zigic has given Birmingham a 1-0 lead at Portsmouth. 8.02pm: Kick-off at Blackburn! And all but one of my plates are now spinning, Barcelona's kick-off coming fashionably late at 9pm. 8.04pm: Some calamitous fisting (really) involving David James has handed his first club, Watford, a 1-0 lead at Ashton Gate. And Lezcano has given Lucerne a 1-0 lead in their Swiss cup tie against Grasshoppers. Half-time whistle just gone there. 8.07pm: Stephen Quinn has given Sheffield United a 1-0 lead at Notts County in one of the stand-out games in League One. \"Peyton Manning has just signed a five year NFL contract for $96million,\" writes Paul Szabo. \"That's $369,000, or \u00a3232,000, per week. For a 35-year old, with four recent neck-bone surgeries, playing a full-contact sport. Oh well, I picked the wrong career.\" Didn't we all, Paul. If only my careers advisor had told me about American Football, I wouldn't be here now. 8.08pm: Championship top-of-the-table update: Southampton and Reading are both winning 1-0. West Ham still goalless. 8.13pm: In fact the Barcelona game has already started, and they're winning already \u2013 Xavi in the third minute, from a Messi assist. Whoever told me that it was going to be on Sky Sports 4 will get a kicking later. 8.17pm: Of course, the problem with trying to watch five games simultaneously is that you end up basically failing to watch any of them. I can tell you, though, that Hanley has just missed a great chance for Blackburn, and Juventus have gone 1-0 up (3-1 on aggregate) against Milan. 8.18pm: Potentially important goalflashes: Peterborough have equalised against Reading, and Dagenham &amp; Redbridge have taken the lead in the League Two relegation scrap against Barnet at Underhill. 8.19pm: But Barnet have equalised, through (inevitably) Izale McLeod. 8.19pm: Messi goal! 8.20pm: The Argentinian scores his eight million and thirty-fourth goal of the season with a tidy left-footed side-footed half-volley that clips the inside of the post and tumbles in. That makes him the joint highest scorer in the club's history (more details here). 8.24pm: Marseille, meanwhile, are 1-0 down at half-time against third-tier Quevilly in their Coupe de France quarter-final. Ouch. 8.25pm: Could Reading's bandwagon be derailed by Posh? Peterborough are now 2-1 up, Tyrone Barnett's having given them a 34th-minute lead. 8.27pm: \"The most talented player from North America is Giuseppe Rossi in my opinion,\" writes Chris Nemeh, apropos nothing in particular. \"We were both born in New Jersey. Similarities end there, as he's a star player for Villareal and Italy, while I am sitting crammed in a cubicle e-mailing you about him while I don't do my job.\" Have you considered a career switch? Because I hear American Football is quite lucrative. 8.32pm: All over by half-time dept: Notts County are now 4-0 down at home to Sheffield United. 8.35pm: Fabrice Muamba T-shirts are very much football's uniform of the day, having been seen everywhere from Barcelona to Peterborough this evening, but kudos to West Ham, whose efforts had \"Get well soon Muamba\" on the front and \"Get well soon Abidal\" on the back. Sentiments that I'm absolutely in support of, I hasten to add. 8.36pm: Crazy scoreline dept: Alfreton Town 2 Mansfield 4 (Anthony Howell 43). 8.38pm: Former England players in unlikely transfers dept: Lee Hendrie has signed for Chasetown. 8.42pm: I always consider the desire to play non-league football even when it (probably) isn't financially necessary suggests that a player is a fairly decent chap. Which means I'll have to rethink my opiniion of Hendrie, which had mainly been formed as a result of stories such as this and this. 8.36pm: Goal every 6.4 minutes dept: Alfreton Town 3 (Anton Brown 45) Mansfield 4. 8.45pm: \"Junior is very exciting, but doesn't quite count as North American quite yet, though we Canadians are hopeful he joins us when he is about good and ready,\" writes Rudy Broers. \"Dempsey has my vote; he's having a great season both in England and with team USA. Hard to dislike anything about the American really.\" Hard, but not impossible, in my experience. I think that while he's certainly admirable, he's got a nasty streak that makes him not entirely loveable. 8.47pm: Half-time at Ewood Park, where it's 0-0 and not much has happened, but for one early (but quite good) goalline clearance from Phil Bardsley. 8.48pm: I should probably also tell you, as I told you about the first two goals in the match, that Nottingham Forest are now 2-1 up at Leeds and by all accounts totally deserving of their lead. 8.55pm: GOAL! Milan have scored against Juventus, a stonking diving header from Djamel Mesbah. 8.57pm: I'm dumping the DFB Pokal to concentrate on Marseille, who remain 1-0 down against Quevilly, 16th in the French first tier, with 19 minutes remaining. This would be their seventh straight defeat, according to Philippa Booth. That's gotta hurt. 8.59pm: Jon Millard points out that Lee Hendrie's financial situation is anything but secure (he was declated bankrupt in January), \"though playing non-league is probably not the best way to dig oneself out of that particular hole, it's true\". 9.00pm: Nottingham Forest are now 3-1 up at Leeds. And Wycombe have taken a 1-0 lead over Exeter in the League One relegation scrap. 9.01pm: And it's Leeds 2 Nottingham Forest 3, Luciano Becchio the scorer. Game back on! 9.02pm: And now it's Leeds 3 Nottingham Forest 3! Madness! 9.05pm: And now it's Leeds 3 Nottingham Forest 4!!! It was 1-1 with a minute of the first half to play, so that's five goals in 12 totally stupid minutes. And a hat-trick for Garath McCleary. 9.06pm: Southampton are now 2-0 up at Hull, Jos Hooiveld with their latest, and surely destined to top the table this evening. 9.08pm: Goal bonanza dept: Leeds United 3 Nottingham Forest 5. I have never in my football-watching life seen a goal spree to match the six scored in 15 Yorkshire minutes tonight. Anyone? 9.11pm: Marseille have equalised! Cross from the right, headed back into the centre and Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my prods home from five yards. On behalf of all underdog-fanciers everwhere: boooooo! 9.13pm: GOAL! West Ham 1 Middlesbrough 0! A deep free-kick headed back across goal from the right of the penalty area by Abdoulaye Faye. He misjudges his header, and as a result it evades all of his team-mates and loops into the net at the far post. 9.15pm: GOAL! Blackburn 1 Sunderland 0! Canada's own Junior Hoilett gets on the scoresheet! Yet another long throw from Pederson is punched poorly to Hoilett's feet, three yards inside the penalty area, and he volleys it first-time into the back of the net. 9.18pm: Faye's header was massively deflected, incidentally. 9.19pm: Back to business after five dull minutes: it's now Leeds United 3 Nottingham Forest 6. I think they now qualify for having their score written out in brackets on the videprinter. 9.21pm: Assorted updates: Exeter 1 Wycombe 3; Brighton 2 Derby 0; Portsmouth 2 10-man Birmingham 1. 9.24pm: Marseille's French Cup tie against Quevilly has gone into extra time. 9.25pm: GOAL! Milan have equalised on aggregate in the 81st minute of their Coppa Italia semi-final second leg tie against Juventus. 9.26pm: GOAL! Lionel Messi has got his second of the night and his 34 million and eighth of the season to become Barcelona's all-time top scorer ever! 9.27pm: Barnet have equalised at home to Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, while Portsmouth are now 3-1 up against 10-man Birmingham. 9.29pm: GOAL! West Ham 1 Middlesbrough 1, and that was a lovely strike from Ogbeche, picking up the ball a couple of yards outside the penalty area, spinning onto his left foot and slamming a left-foot shot low and hard into the back of the net. 9.30pm: Peterborough are now 3-1 up against Reading, whose dreams of taking over at the top of the Championship will have to wait for a while. 9.32pm: It just can't be dept: Leeds United 3 Nottingham Forest 7! Leeds concede seven at home for the first time ever. The last time Forest scored five or more goals was also in Yorkshire, a 7-1 victory at Sheffield Wednesday in 1995. 9.35pm: Incredible miss! McLean's driven cross sent flying over an empty net from six yards by Ji Dong-Won. That really was horrible. 9.37pm: Middlesbrough have hit the bar in stoppage time at Upton Park, where it's still 1-1 with a minute still to play. 9.38pm: Serene progress dept: Charlton 3 (Darel Russell 90) Yeovil 0. 9.39pm: Final scores flooding in now, and boos are ringing out at Upton Park after West Ham's fifth successive home draw \u2013 it's finished 1-1 there. 9.41pm: Simon in Canada has sent me 22 emails since 9.03pm this evening. He's more prolific than Garath McLeary. Is this a record, I wonder? Hang on, there's another! 23! GOAL! Blackburn 2 Sunderland 0 (Yakubu, 86) Cross from the right, Yakubu has two defenders within a couple of yards of him but neither comes close either to him or the ball as he heads in from six yards. \"If Steve Kean keeps Blackburn up, he won't be Manager of the Year, but he deserves a mention in dispatches,\" suggests Gary Naylor. \"To be where he is after all he's been through, is a helluva show of will (and not a bad show of skill either).\" 9.47pm: Championship update: Southampton won, but neither West Ham, who drew, nor Reading, who lost at Peterborough, could match them. The Saints are now five points clear at the top. Portsmouth are still bottom, but they'll be feeling a lot chirpier after their 4-1 victory over Birmingham. Not as chirpy as Nottingham Forest, who thrashed Leeds 7-3 at Elland Road, the kind of game everyone there (and quite a few people who weren't) will be telling their grandchildren about. 9.48pm: The last time I looked at the French Cup quarter-final it was 1-1, and now it's 2-2. I can't tell you anything about those two goals, but it's still humiliating for Marseille. 9.49pm: GOAL! Juventus score to take a 4-3 lead on aggregate over Milan in the sixth minute of extra time, a no-run-up long-range top-corner screamer from, um, somebody. 9.51pm: It's all over at Ewood Park, where Blackburn have won 2-0. Also, Mansfield have scored twice in the last two minutes to give their final score a Forest-rivalling ring: it's Alfreton Town 3 Mansfield 6! 9.52pm: Philippa Booth saw what I didn't in the Quevilly v Marseille match: \"Aynia (Quevilly) scored, down the right, in, nice finish, then I got distracted and missed Remy's equaliser immediately from the restart.\" 9.54pm: GOAL! Quevilly 3 Marseille 2! And I did see that one. A free-kick from deep, Marseille's keeper comes for it, gets both gloves on the ball and then drops it again, and it falls kindly to Ayina, who sends the ball bobbling goalwards. GOAL! Crystal Palace 1 Barnsley 0! Palace score a last-minute winner, through Sean Scannell. 9.59pm: Final score! Quevilly have beaten Marseille 3-2 after extra time to reach the French Cup quarter-finals. Incredible stuff. 10.00pm: And Borussia Dortmund beat Gr\u00fcther Furth 1-0 after extra time in the DFB Pokal, incidentally. 10.06pm: Oh, and I didn't tell you that Messi scored a hat-trick in Barcelona's 5-3 win over Granada in the Primera Liga and is now Barcelona's all-time greatest goalscorer. The third goal, which I didn't see, was apparently a bit special. 10.07pm: And with that, I'm going to sign off. It's been memorable. Thanks for your company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
