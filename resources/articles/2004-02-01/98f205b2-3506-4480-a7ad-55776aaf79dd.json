In both tone and substance the strategy outlined by David Swift, head of the Association of Chief Police Officers' anti-hooligan operations, is the product of common sense and experience. The former has often been conspicuous by its absence from official attempts to combat hooliganism. As the burghers of Copenhagen, Marseille and Charleroi would attest, however, no one has more of the latter than the English. This summer, it seems, that experience will be put to practical use. If there is trouble, England face expulsion from the tournament. With 50,000 English football fans mingling among 200,000 British holidaymakers and expatriates on the Algarve, it promises to be as fraught a month for the FA as for the Portuguese police. Two elements of Swift's announcement are significant. First, the authorities have abandoned the emphasis on ticketing as a tool of policing. For a decade fans without tickets have been advised not to travel. The message was routinely ignored because supporters know that, given time, money and effort, they can always get a ticket. The subtext was: if you had a ticket, you were good; if not, you were bad - an inference which many supporters felt served to criminalise them in the eyes of the foreign police forces. The reality is that lack of a ticket is no measure of criminal intent, and that has now been recognised. The more important element concerns the tone the Portuguese police intend to adopt. One of the lessons of Charleroi and Marseille, revealed in research funded by the Home Office, is that, though England fans were not blameless, heavy-handed policing contributed to the disturbances. If Swift is right, this summer the riot police will be a last resort and smiling unarmed officers the norm. \"The Portuguese want to create a festival atmosphere by having a policing strategy that acknowledges that, while a substantial culture of drinking and boisterous behaviour exists, that is distinct from the few with an outright desire to cause trouble,\" he said. \"You have to create an atmosphere where the majority of supporters feel comfortable with the police approach. Then they are more likely to marginalise the trouble-makers, to self-police and to deny the opportunist hooligans the chance to create trouble.\" It is an uncomfortable thought that the Portuguese will have to accept the drunken, disrespectful antics of some English supporters as the price of peace - what Swift described as \"business as usual on the Algarve\" - but it is one they appear willing to pay. The modified approach is in part the product of liaison with supporters' groups, some of whom at last appear willing to try to change the face of England's support from within, rather than turning a blind eye to the outrages conducted by some of their number. The Home Office has listened and tournament organisers have consulted closely with these groups. Other elements of Swift's plan were familiar. Banning orders, the product of legislation introduced after Euro 2000, will be sought against 2,500 hooligans by the summer. If they are granted, the Home Office will consider the \u00a35m it assigned last year to increase intelligence gathering against hooligans money well spent. They will need more help from magistrates, however. Last month seven men convicted of racist chanting at a Hartlepool match were not issued with banning orders. Police are appealing against the decision but the hard work will be undone if the courts do not support the police. None of these measures guarantees that England fans will not go on the rampage in June. In recent years violence has followed England almost as a matter of course. Police and administrators remain outwardly hopeful but even the most optimistic supporters say trouble is inevitable. All the ingredients for chaos will be present - hot sun, cheap beer, numerous opposing fans to fight, the Germans - and no one would be surprised if even sensitively policed fans end up literally kicking their hosts in the teeth. But the police have done their bit; now it is down to the fans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
