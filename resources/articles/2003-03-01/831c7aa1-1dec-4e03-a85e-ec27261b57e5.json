It's one of the biggest service and maintenance suppliers to the oil industry and has a formidable reputation in the sector. Its subsidiary, Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, built harbours, roads, bridges, airports and military bases during the Vietnam war. In Bosnia and Kosovo the company received over $2bn from the US army to help run and maintain its bases. Halliburton has already been awarded a potentially lucrative contract to resurrect the Iraqi oilfields after the war. Kellogg Brown &amp; Root recently won a ten year open-ended contract from the Pentagon to maintain new military bases worldwide and to run aid operations. It also built the pens used to house prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Bechtel Bechtel is one of the world's largest engineering firms and has close links to the US oil, space and defence industries. It is currently seeking damages from Bolivia, the poorest nation in South America, after the country's government cancelled a deal to privatise part of the water supply. The company also helped build the US nuclear power industry and is involved with the oil industry. Fluor The Fluor Corporation is one of the world's biggest engineering and construction firms. It has many deals with the US and Mexican oil industries. One of the biggest, to help exploit the giant Cantarell field in the Gulf of Mexico, is worth an estimated $19 billion over 12 years. Its business partners include Bechtel and Halliburton. Fluor is being sued in the New York District Court by some of the victims of apartheid. The company, along with more than a dozen others, was accused of \"aiding and abetting\" the apartheid regime in South Africa. Louis Berger Group The Louis Berger Group also has dealings with the US power and gas industries. It was a contractor for the giant US U-Tapo airforce base in Thailand during the Vietnam war. The company has links with the Middle East, having helped build the Ovda air base in Israel. Apart from military bases, the company helped build the Trans-Amazon highway which opened up the rainforest to logging trucks. The Louis Berger Group recently came to the fore after it helped the US government clear up the rubble following the American ousting of the Taliban. The company is now helping reconstruct the Kabul-Kandahar-Herat highway and will build schools, hospitals and sewage treatment plants. Parsons Corp The Parsons Group is also a significant player in the US oil industry and has very close links to the US military. It describes itself as a \"world leader in engineering, procurement and construction of oil and gas production facilities, pipelines and terminals\". Its expertise makes it well placed to profit from the rebuilding of the Iraqi oil industry. It is already involved in $8 billion worth of contracts with Middle Eastern and central Asian oil-rich governments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
