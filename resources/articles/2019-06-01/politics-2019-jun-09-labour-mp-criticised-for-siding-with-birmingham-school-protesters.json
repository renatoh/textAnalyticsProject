Roger Godsiff, the MP for the city\u2019s Hall Green constituency, which includes Anderton Park Primary school, also told protesters they had a \u201cjust cause\u201d and criticised the headteacher. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said she had reported the \u201cdiscriminatory and irresponsible\u201d comments to the chief whip, Nick Brown, as Godsiff was criticised by a number of Labour MPs. A Labour spokesman said the party had long supported and campaigned for LGBT-inclusive education in schools and there was \u201cno justifiable reason\u201d to stop teaching about such topics. \u201cRoger Godsiff will be spoken to by the chief whip and reminded of his responsibilities as an MP,\u201d he said. Parents have staged weeks of protests outside the school against the teaching of LGBT rights, claiming the lessons were \u201coveremphasising a gay ethos\u201d and contradicting Islam. The demonstrations, which were described last week as \u201chomophobic\u201d by the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, led the council to apply for a high court interim injunction, which banned rallies outside the gates from Friday. Godsiff, who has previously said the equality lessons were not \u201cage appropriate\u201d, was seen telling protesters they were right in a video that emerged this weekend. The veteran MP, who is seen with Shakeel Afsar, the lead organiser of the protests, said: \u201cI think you have a just cause and I regret the fact that it hasn\u2019t been reciprocated by the headteacher.\u201d He asked demonstrators toconsider calling off the protest as he said they had made their point, but added that it would be their choice to do so. He then said: \u201cI will continue to try and fight your corner, because you\u2019re right. Nothing more, nothing less. You\u2019re right.\u201d Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, said he would be tabling a formal complaint to the party about Godsiff. \u201cThis made me feel sick to my stomach. One of my own Labour colleagues stood with people who have peddled hatred and bigotry on school gates, intimidating pupils, teachers and parents,\u201d he said. The Labour LGBT group also called for the whip to be removed and condemned Godsiff\u2019s remarks \u201cunreservedly and unequivocally\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
