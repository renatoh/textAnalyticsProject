Jonathan Pearce, 38, and his daughter Charley, from the West Midlands, were on a First Choice holiday with six other members of their family, who were all travelling in the same open topped 4x4 when it crashed into a tractor. Pearce's eight-year-old nephew, Joseph, was said to be in a critical but stable condition after Monday's crash. The 4x4 was in a convoy of four vehicles that were taking part in a safari, organised by a local company, Sarigerme Tours. They were returning the tourists to their holiday village in Sarigerme, on the south-west coast of Turkey, when the accident happened. The holidaymakers had been having water pistol fights between the vehicles but the crash happened when another passing tourist joined in, according to others travelling in the convoy. One eyewitness, who asked not to be named, told a local news agency: \"It was dreadful, really dreadful. One minute they were all laughing and squirting each other with water pistols. It was a long straight stretch of road and the tractor had broken down at the side. \"We didn't see it happen but we were told that the driver, a young lad, was squirted with water, which temporarily blinded him. He saw the tractor too late and swerved to avoid it but as he swerved the back of the jeep took the full impact of the crash. They were standing up in the jeep having a whale of a time. When they hit the tractor I saw them being flung out into the road \" The eyewitness said no one in the 4x4 had been wearing a seatbelt. The other vehicles reversed back and people tried to help the victims. They covered up Charley because she was \"obviously dead\". The injured were taken to the Yucelen hospital, in Mugla, an hour away, where father-of two Pearce, whose wife Joanne was also in the 4x4, died of his injuries. Of the 10 passengers in the vehicle, eight were from the Pearce family. Charley's uncle, Joseph Pearce, and her cousin Stephan, six, were treated for cuts, bruises and shock before being released. Another British man, Chan Singh, who had been in the same vehicle with his wife, was also taken to hospital, although the Foreign Office in London said he had suffered only minor injuries. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said she understood that the driver of the 4x4 vehicle had been detained. Police at the nearby station of Ortaca confirmed they were looking for a German motorbike tourist who had allegedly thrown water at the vehicle. A spokesman for Sarigerme Tours said staff were \"very, very sad\" at the tragic accident and that the company had never had an accident previously in five years of running 4x4 safaris. \"Four jeeps went out on the safari. Three of them had passed the broken down tractor. But as the fourth jeep came down the road a German motorbike tourist thought he'd join in the fun and threw water at the jeep. \"It hit the driver in the face and temporarily blinded him. He swerved to avoid the tractor but the back of our vehicle hit the [tractor's] trailer and the passengers were thrown out.\" A relative in the West Midlands, who did not wish to be identified, said the rest of the family had only found about the accident yesterday and were completely distraught. \"It is all too soon and still raw at the moment to say anything else.\" A First Choice spokeswoman said it was \"a deeply sad time\" and the company wished to express its heartfelt sympathy to the family and friends of those killed. She said resort staff were offering support and assistance to the rest of the family and emphasised that the safari organiser was not affiliated to First Choice. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"We can confirm that two British nationals died and seven were injured in a road traffic accident whilst on a jeep safari in Turkey yesterday.\" She added that the family were receiving consular advice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
