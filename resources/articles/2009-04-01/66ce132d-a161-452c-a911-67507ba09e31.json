The Audit Commission said it became concerned about the quality of information available to NHS non-executive directors after an infection scandal at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells hospitals in Kent. It looked into quality control at a sample of 15 acute hospitals and mental health trusts in England. They all had procedures to guard against risk, but many of the boards relied on information of dubious value. The commission said: \"In the worst cases, the assurance process had become a paper chase rather than a critical examination of the effectiveness of the trust's internal controls and risk management arrangements. It added: \"The NHS has, in many cases, been run on trust.\" The commission found one trust that did not bother to define any strategic objectives. Others had so many goals that it was difficult for board members to identify and manage risks. It said the NHS should have learned from the international banking crisis that it is important for boards to understand and assess risk reliably. The commission did not name any of the defective trusts. It said all boards \u2013 including independent NHS foundation trusts \u2013 should review their risk management arrangements. Steve Bundred, chief executive of the Audit Commission, said: \"Our evidence suggests that, while processes are in place, many board members at NHS trusts and foundation trusts are not always getting the right information that is needed to go hand in hand with the critical nature of work in hospitals. \"Those who are charged with running our hospitals must be more challenging of the information they are given and more sceptical in their approach.\" He added: \"Healthcare is inherently risky and complex, and assurance is not easy in the public or private sectors. To do their jobs properly, NHS board members must review their risk management arrangements so that they can be absolutely confident that their trust is providing high quality care by well-trained staff in a safe environment all of the time.\" Bill Moyes, executive chairman of Monitor, the regulator of foundation trusts, said: \"We rely on boards to be the front line of regulation. For boards to do this requires them not only to have the right information, but also assurance that it is accurate, relevant and reliable. \"This report ... does not aim to provide another checklist, or more guidance in an area where there is plenty, but rather to paint a picture as to what good assurance may look like. It also encourages boards to pose the question in what way do they assure themselves that this is the case.\" The commission's investigation was triggered by a report from health inspectors in 2007 on outbreaks of infection from Clostridium difficile (C diff) at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells hospitals. They found: \"[The trust] had not put in place appropriate measures to manage and prevent infection, despite having high rates of C diff over several years. [It] had consistently been among the 25% of trusts with the highest rates of C diff since mandatory surveillance began in January 2004. [But] the board was unaware of the high infection rates and did not spend enough time considering issues relating to infection control [including] the shortage of nurses, poor care for patients and poor processes for managing the movement of patients from one ward to another, all of which contributed to the risk of spreading the infection.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
