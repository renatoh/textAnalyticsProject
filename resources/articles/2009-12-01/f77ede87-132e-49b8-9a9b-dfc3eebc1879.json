She's on TV again! On Christmas Eve! That's the thing when you don't do a Christmas sketch show for nine years \u2013 people get very excited when they hear there's one in the pipeline. For me, Wood is a comedian like no other. She has a kind of warmth that I've not seen anyone else replicate: a gentle manner, beneath which lies a sharp and brilliant comic mind. It's that unexpected mixture \u2013 and a keen sense of the ridiculous \u2013 that makes her such glorious watching. (That, and the fact that with every passing year she looks younger and better. How?) So we've established that I was excited about tonight's show. And there were bits of it that delighted me: the Margaret Mountford dancing was inspirational; I loved the big show number of Let's Do It at the end; there were some brilliant lines in the housewives' Olympics sections. But for me, there wasn't enough of Victoria Wood \u2013 and oddly, not enough of her usual cohorts either. I spent half the show waiting for Celia Imrie or Duncan Preston to turn up, and felt slightly short-changed when they didn't. And lovely though it is to see Julie Walters and Wood on screen together, was I the only one who felt there was rather too much of Bo Beaumont? In fact, a bit too much of all the sketches that repeated: my favourite moment in Lark Pies to Cranchesterford involved Wood's enormous puff sleeves blocking out the camera \u2013 a little Acorn Antiques-type moment that had me in hysterics. But what did you think? Was the conceit of a Midlife Christmas a good one, or a concept that hemmed things in unnecessarily? I rather think the latter \u2013 why does Victoria Wood need a reason to be on TV? The only theme I need to see is Victoria Wood. So tell us: what did you think to the song update; how much would you like to see Margaret dancing with Nick in real life; and what were your best bits? \u2022 Phil Hogan's review of Christmas TV will appear on December 27.
