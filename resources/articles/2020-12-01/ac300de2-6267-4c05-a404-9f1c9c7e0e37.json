The Bank of England said on Thursday that distributions to shareholders, which were frozen in March, can resume because banks are \u201cresilient to a wide range of economic outcomes\u201d, including ugly ones. The move feels premature. The Prudential Regulation Authority at the Bank will have reached its decision with hard analysis, of course. It\u2019s also true that the City viewed banks\u2019 capital buffers as strong (at least by historical standards) at the start of the Covid crisis, and that provisions for pandemic-related losses currently look conservative. Yet all financial forecasts these days are riddled with uncertainties. In the case of the banks, the heaviest loan defaults will arrive when the Treasury removes props from under the economy \u2013 furlough schemes, rates reliefs and so on \u2013 and unemployment rises. An economy showing headline GDP growth can still deliver unexpected losses for lenders. As the chancellor likes to remind us, \u201cthe economic emergency has only just begun\u201d. The temporary dividend ban was imposed to ensure credit would flow to households and businesses. The banks have kept their side of the bargain better than they did in 2009-2011, it should be said, so perhaps we should be reassured that the PRA thinks they\u2019ve got enough capital to pay dividends on top, albeit within new \u201cguardrails\u201d. But the timing still looks odd. Yes, dividends are important for investors \u2013 no argument there. But this is also the moment of a maximum uncertainty on an EU trade deal. Would it really have hurt to delay the all-clear for three months? Breaking up is hard to do, but an intact Facebook may be invincible \u201cWho is the competitor that will come past it? Because I can\u2019t actually think of one.\u201d So said Terry Smith, one of the UK\u2019s top fund managers, in 2019, explaining why, to the consternation of some of his investors, he had bought shares in Facebook for the popular Fundsmith fund. Followers\u2019 bafflement flowed from the climate around Facebook. Governments and regulators were on the prowl, creating data and privacy protections for users and demanding that the sewer of fake news be cleaned up. Remedies sounded expensive. Smith\u2019s argument was that governments\u2019 actions would also have the effect of \u201cbuilding a competitive moat [around Facebook] that is insurmountable for a competitor\u201d. He compared the process to what happened in the tobacco industry when severe restrictions were placed on advertising cigarettes. Market leaders knew nobody would ever again launch a tobacco company and new brands would struggle to be seen. Years of easy profits followed. Investing in Facebook has also been profitable. If you caught the dip in the share price in late 2018 and early 2019 that was provoked by regulatory worries, you\u2019ve doubled your money. Facebook\u2019s operating costs have increased massively but the company still generates 40% profit margins thanks to its dominance \u2013 with Google \u2013 of online advertising dollars. Facebook doesn\u2019t even have to try to make money from WhatsApp, a business it bought for $19bn (\u00a314bn) in 2014. It now looks as if the US Federal Trade Commission, and a group of 48 US attorneys-general, have reached a similar conclusion to Smith\u2019s: trying to tie Facebook up in knots doesn\u2019t weaken the company\u2019s competitive position and may strengthen it. Unlike Smith, the FTC has to worry about the consequences of lack of competition, so is aiming for a full break-up. \u201cWe currently expect that [the remedy] will include divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp,\u201d it said. Proving that Facebook\u2019s behaviour has been anti-competitive will be hard. Some of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s emails in the filings make him sound like a monopolist on a mission to buy or squash promising startups. \u201cIt is better to buy than compete,\u201d he is recorded as saying in 2008. On the other hand, chief executives are expected to fret about commercial threats. But Facebook\u2019s grumble about the FTC\u2019s lawsuit sending \u201ca chilling warning to American business that no sale is ever final\u201d feels weak. Yes, the purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp were approved at the time by regulators, but the current state of play also matters. If stiffer competition would have improved the lot of users of Facebook\u2019s services \u2013 which is what the FTC contends \u2013 that\u2019s a material point. Whatever happens, this feels like the only regulatory challenge that counts for Facebook. The FTC is using the heaviest weapon \u2013 the Sherman Antitrust Act that was used to break up AT&amp;T in the 1980s and Standard Oil in 1911. If Facebook survives intact, it really will become hard to see how any rival could ever catch up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
