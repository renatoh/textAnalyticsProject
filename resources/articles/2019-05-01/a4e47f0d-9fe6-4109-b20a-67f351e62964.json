When this team is hungry, they are such a special team. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to put a bit of blood in that water, so this team gets even hungrier.\u201d Kompany often tries to ensure there is no lessening of focus. \u201cMy style is pretty simple. Every now and then, when things are getting too comfortable, I go a little aggressive in training or I speak up and say what I think. \u201cBut the main thing is that these guys, together with the manager, are always able to understand what the priority is. We focus on winning games. Winning one [Premier League] title was not enough, it had been done before. Back to back \u2013 that is special.\u201d Kompany\u2019s 71st-minute winner against Leicester last Monday week was pivotal to City retaining the title, because it came in the penultimate match. He played down its significance and preferred to reflect on the 4-1 win at Brighton. \u201cMy goal feels like it happened two months ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to Kun [Sergio Ag\u00fcero] for scoring as quickly as he did on Sunday, I\u2019m grateful to Aymeric Laporte for scoring when he did and I\u2019m grateful to Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan. That sums us up \u2013 I\u2019ve given four or five names and all these guys stepped up when they needed to. \u201cWe\u2019re a big team and there\u2019s no denying this. I\u2019m so eager to play the FA Cup final, I\u2019m so motivated. You can\u2019t be complacent going into any game. To have reached this final is an achievement in itself but now we need to try to win it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
