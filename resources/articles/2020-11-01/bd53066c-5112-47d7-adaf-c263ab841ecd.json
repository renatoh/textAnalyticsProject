You\u2019ve got to love the Europa. Here are all our reports from tonight. Adios. Here\u2019s an altogether more languid Mikel Arteta: \u201cIt was really important for us to win tonight. We got a goal behind, we had to be patient but generated a lot of chances. Today, our combinations in the final third were really good. \u201cOur young players want to make a difference, they play with personality. Joe Willock scored and he made a lot of chances. If he keeps doing that consistently, he will get his chance.\u201d Here\u2019s Neil Lennon, who is in the grip of a quiet, cold-eyed rage. \u201cWe started OK but then got really ragged with the ball, we conceded from a set piece again. We were so lackadaisical, I don\u2019t know where that performance came from. I can only apologise to the supporters. We get back into the game at 2-1, but conceded a really poor goal. \u201cThe hungrier team won tonight, and that\u2019s on the players. As a collective, as individuals, it was a very poor performance. There\u2019s a definite lack of hunger there. It\u2019s not acceptable, it\u2019s not good enough. I can\u2019t defend that. We have to change the attitude in the dressing room.\u201d Lennon is also informed that Mohamed Elyounoussi was seen looking at his phone in the stands after being subbed off. \u201cHe\u2019d better not have been,\u201d he whispers in genuinely menacing fashion. He goes on to describe the performance as \u201clackadaisical\u201d, \u201clazy\u201d and \u201cinsipid\u201d. And here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg on a mixed night for Arsenal: Here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s match report from the King Power: Here\u2019s Joe Willock, Arsenal\u2019s standout player tonight: \u201cThe first half they played really well, we had to stick to the game plan and not get frustrated. I wasn\u2019t making a mistake [with the goal], I had missed a couple of chances earlier! I\u2019m a young kid trying to play, and make the most of every chance. I trust the manager. When I get the chance in the Premier League, I want to do my talking on the pitch.\u201d Here\u2019s Callum McGregor with a refreshingly honest appraisal of Celtic\u2019s performance: \u201cWe cannot perform like that at this level. We were so disjointed, it was unbelievable. Everyone was trying to score, we were leaving two on two at the back. We started really poorly, and had to chase the game. You can\u2019t lose 4-1 at home. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d Milan 0-3 Lille Royal Antwerp 0-1 Lask Dinamo Zagreb 1-0 Wolfsberger Feyenoord 3-1 CSKA Moscow Crvena Zvezda 2-1 Gent Zorya Luhansk 1-4 AEK Athens Hoffenheim 5-0 Liberec Villarreal 1-0 Maccabi Tel Aviv* Young Boys 3-0 CSKA Sofia *HT score; game delayed by bad weather Two for Kelechi Iheanacho as Leicester take charge of the group with another very impressive attacking display. The visitors took the lead and posed plenty of problems, but Arsenal turned it around in style and are set fair to top their group. Sparta Prague were very good value and took their chances clinically, but this was an another grim, grim night for Celtic in Europe. Look away now, Celtic fans. Sparta play it around a static home defence, before Dockal\u2019s deep cross is headed in by Krejci at the far post. Joe Willock has worked really hard up front and deserves this goal. Elneny passes to Pepe, whose through ball allows Willock to fire into the roof of the net. Linde gets a hand to it, but can\u2019t keep it out. Leke James, a forward signed from the Chinese second tier, has come on for Molde. His shot from 20 yards deflects off David Luiz and into the side netting with Leno wrong-footed. Saka makes a risible mess of a chance from two yards out, and is relieved to see the offside flag go up. At Celtic Park, the hosts have rather given up the chase. James Maddison gets on the scoresheet for Leicester, who are romping home in what looked a tough fixture on paper. Shane Duffy (I think) was all over the place there, getting turned inside out by David Karlsson, who crossed for Julis to tap in. At the Emirates, Kieran Tierney and Mohamed Elneny are on in place od Ceballos and Xhaka. Lille\u2019s lead in Milan means Celtic really need something from tonight\u2019s game ... but they\u2019re not going to get it! Lukas Julis takes advantage of some Sunday league defending to complete his hat-trick on the break. Lille lead 3-0! It\u2019s that man Yuzici again, completing his hat-trick. He\u2019s now got six goals in three group games. Feyenoord have scored three in just nine minutes against CSKA Moscow, and Villarreal lead 1-0 in soggy Spain. More hot super-sub action as newcomer Bukayo Saka dances down the left and pulls back for Nicolas Pepe, moved back to the right but drifting centrally, who drills the ball home. Arsenal have got the job done! An excellent night\u2019s work for Leicester and Kelechi Iheanacho in particular. Here, he bursts into the box down the left and picks out substitute Dennis Praet, who sweeps home from five yards. Moments after Michal Sacek struck the post from long range for Sparta, Griffiths strikes on the rebound after Tom Rogic\u2019s shot is blocked. Celtic back in it! An instant impact from substitute Leigh Griffiths! It\u2019s another own goal, with half-time substitute Sheriff Sinyan the unfortunate party this time. It\u2019s made by Joe Willock again, too - his cross from the right throwing the defender into a panic, his attempted clearance flying into the far corner! At Celtic Park, Shane Duffy makes a crucial tackle to stop Sparta Prague adding a third, before Jeremie Frimpong fires just wide for the hosts. Neil Lennon brings on Leigh Griffiths and Hatem Elhamed, replacing Brown and Elyounoussi. Iheanacho draws a decent save from Matheus, with the impressive Cengiz Under sending the rebound over the bar. Lille lead 2-0 at San Siro, Yazici on target again. They are going top of Group H as it stands. Big chance for Arsenal! Linde flaps at a cross and the ball lands at Kolasinac\u2019s feet, five yards out - but he skews his shot over the bar. Yikes. That was a sitter. Maddison is furious with Iheanacho after the forward tries a weak shot rather than play him in. Leicester almost pay the price immediately, Ruiz getting in behind but toe-poking his shot just wide. It\u2019s a second of the night for Kelechi Iheanacho! He collects a pass from Cengiz Under and tries to catch Matheus out at his near post. Instead, his shot takes a big deflection and loops inside the far post. Not that he\u2019ll mind! We are back under way around the grounds. Here\u2019s our report from Benfica v Rangers: Here\u2019s the rest of the half-time scores. Villarreal v Maccabi Tel Aviv was delayed by an hour due to torrential rain. Milan 0-1 Lille Royal Antwerp 0-0 Lask Dinamo Zagreb 0-0 Wolfsberger Feyenoord 0-0 CSKA Moscow Crvena Zvezda 1-1 Gent Zorya Luhansk 0-2 AEK Athens Hoffenheim 2-0 Liberec Young Boys 3-0 CSKA Sofia Arsenal have forced their way back into the game after Martin Ellingsen\u2019s shock opener for the away side. An awful night at the office for Celtic so far. James Maddison so nearly doubles Leicester\u2019s lead, but his low shot is palmed away by Matheus. Still, the Fozes go in ahead. Celtic\u2019s European hopes may be fading away tonight. Lukas Julis gets his second just before half time, latching on to Adam Karabec\u2019s through ball and finishing in style. Now Arsenal do equalise! Willock is at the heart of things again, scurrying through the defence to meet Eddie Nketiah\u2019s cross. He\u2019s denied by Linde but the ball skids off Haugen\u2019s knee, and rolls into the net! No goal! Pepe puts down the ukelele and fires in a low cross towards Willock, who is offside - but Eddie Nketiah isn\u2019t, and he gets in first to score. The flag stays up though, with Willock interfering with play. Had he hung back, that would have counted. Marc Albrighton gets booked for an unsightly lunge on Galeno. Over at the Emirates, the ball\u2019s in the net ... Celtic hit the bar! It\u2019s Elyounoussi again, his effort clipping the top of the bar from Christie\u2019s cross. Back in north London, Molde pose a question of their own, with Mustafi called upon to intercept Haugen\u2019s low cross. Arsenal are starting to cause a few problems, with Willian and Pepe switching wings. The former finds space for a cross, but lifts it over everyone waiting in the middle. In Leicester\u2019s group, AEK Athens have taken a 2-0 lead at Zorya Luhansk. In Celtic\u2019s group, Yusuf Yazici\u2019s penalty has Lille a goal up against Milan at San Siro. \u201cAt this point, presumably Arteta would rather like the more senior members to step up a little bit; that means for example Pepe actually doing something positive rather than playing the ukulele out on the right hand side,\u201d says Charles Antaki. In the space where Pepe should be, Joe Willock makes inroads instead, beating Hussain, who is lucky not to bring him down. He wins a corner, which comes to nothing. At the King Power, a Braga cross causes a spot of bother, with Hamza Choudhury slipping and almost putting his back-pass beyond Schmeichel. At the other end, Maddison fires just over from 25 yards out. \u201cDavid Luiz is taking Social Distancing to extremes,\u201d notes Peter Littley. Indeed - as sweet a hit as it was, Ellingsen was given far too long to pick his spot. Oh, Celtic. Neil Lennon\u2019s side had started brightly but fall behind from a corner. David Hancko\u2019s header hits the post but Lukas Julis is first to the rebound! Villarreal v Maccabi Tel Aviv is on! As my colleague Philip Cornwall points out, it looks like perfect conditions for the Yellow Submarine... It\u2019s Martin Ellingsen who strikes at the Emirates after Bernd Leno\u2019s hoof downfield is played back into his path. He steps forward and fires into the far corner from 20 yards out! Pick that one out... Well, well. Molde take the lead in brilliant style! A very well-taken, if slightly strange opener for Leicester! Iheanacho plays a one-two with Maddison, who is still moving gingerly and advances on Matheus from a narrow angle. His first cross/shot is saved but spilled, and he tucks in the rebound. Worrying scenes for Leicester fans as James Maddison goes down under a challenge from Elmusrati. He requires a spell of treatment, but is able to continue. Meanwhile, Arsenal v Molde is held up while the assistant ref adjusts his earpiece. Modern football, eh? Celtic are up against Sparta Prague, the Czech league leaders. Both teams are winless after two Europa League games. Sparta have a free kick after Scott Brown\u2019s handball but Celtic break, Elyounoussi eventually prodding wide after a goalmouth melee. At the Emirates, Pepe shanks a cross behind goal as Arsenal struggle to get going. Braga have started positively, their front three pressing the home defence. A potential postponement at Villarreal, where torrential rain means the kick-off time for their game against Maccabi Tel-Aviv has been provisionally put back to 10pm local (9pm GMT). A final decision will be made in the next few minutes; it doesn\u2019t look great. Leicester are up against Braga in a game that will likely decide who tops their group. The Portuguese side are managed by none other than Carlos Carvalhal. Early on, a hopeful through ball finds Iheanacho, who gets shoved over near the corner flag by Braga keeper Matheus, a long old way off his line. Early chance for Arsenal! Pepe plays in Nketiah, who closes in on goal but lifts his shot just beyond the far post. Here\u2019s Louise Taylor on a landmark night for Harry Kane: Thanks, Scott. The games are under way at the King Power, the Emirates and Celtic Park. And with that, I\u2019ll hand over to Niall McVeigh, who will take you by the hand and lead you through the 8pm kick-offs. Big games for Arsenal, Celtic and Leicester City coming up. Thanks for reading. Here are the results of all the 5.55pm kick-offs: A: Roma 5-0 Cluj B: Rapid Vienna 4-2 Dundalk C: Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva 2-4 Bayer Leverkusen; Slavia Prague 3-2 Nice D: Benfica 3-3 Rangers, Lech Poznan 3-1 Standard Liege E: Omonia Nicosia 0-2 Granada; PAOK Salonika 4-1 PSV Eindhoven F: HNK Rikjeka 1-2 Napoli; Real Sociedad 1-0 AZ Alkmaar I: Sivasspor 2-0 Qarabag J: Ludogorets 1-3 Tottenham Hotspur Thing is, Rangers would have been perfectly happy with a point at the start of the evening. But that should have been three points for Steven Gerrard\u2019s side. Benfica look relieved; Rangers, to a man, appear a little stunned. That\u2019s a sickener ... though when it all comes down, they should take pride in their overall performance. And hey, it\u2019s a lesson learned. Benfica have salvaged their unbeaten Europa League home record! Nunez scampers clear down the middle and slots powerfully into the bottom right. McGregor never had a chance. Rangers should have been out of sight ... but now look! Spurs get their Europa League campaign back on track with a solid if unspectacular win in Bulgaria. Spurs have been pretty quiet since Lo Celso restored their two-goal lead. Bergwijn mooches down the left and rolls an inviting pass across the face of goal. Vinicius makes no real attempt to connect. A chance of a confidence-boosting goal sails away. Rangers have regained a little composure and are playing keep-ball right now. Game management from the top drawer. Benfica can\u2019t get a touch right now. Benfica suddenly look like ten-and-a-half men. Rafa Silva\u2019s goal has also taken a little wind out of the Rangers sail. The lovely free-flowing stuff of earlier is no more. It\u2019s going to be a long ten minutes. Helander allows Nunez to dribble into the box from the left. Nunez reaches the byline and cuts back for Rafa Silva, who can\u2019t miss from a couple of yards. For all Rangers\u2019 dominance, this is suddenly back on! Incidentally, Morelos\u2019s goal tonight is his 22nd in European competition for Rangers ... and that\u2019s a new club record. Ally McCoist, now second on the list, will no doubt console himself with the 20 trophies he won at Ibrox. Morelos is still stuck on zero ... though the way Rangers are playing this season, there\u2019s a fair chance he\u2019ll get hold of some silver soon. A fourth Rangers goal seems just a matter of time. Tavernier and Arfield combine crisply down the inside-right channel, but the latter overruns when put through. Rangers are playing some lovely football, albeit with the old against-ten-men caveat. Kent tries to curl one into the bottom right from the edge of the box. He\u2019s inches wide. Up the other end, McGregor has had very little to do since picking the ball out of his net after 60 seconds or so. Spurs and Rangers both look completely comfortable at the minute. The minutes drift by. Kent should make it four for Rangers. It\u2019s a lovely move, Morelos fizzing a pass inside from the left for Jack, who dinks a defence-splitter down the middle for Kent. He draws the keeper and slips the ball past him, but off the base of the right-hand post. Benfica are all over the shop here. Spurs throw on Son Heung-min. He\u2019s immediately sent scampering into the box down the inside-left channel by Hojbjerg, He unselfishly rolls into the centre for Lo Celso, who taps home. Seventeen seconds that took Son. He really is an incredible force of nature. Spurs are no longer playing with their first-half sass. Ludogorets are giving this a good go. By contrast, Rangers are pressing forward looking for the fourth goal that would categorically do for Benfica. They\u2019re playing with the sort of confidence that only comes when you\u2019re on a nine-game winning run. An immediate warning for Rangers: this isn\u2019t over yet. Rafa Silva sashays down the inside-right channel and into the box. He\u2019s one on one with McGregor, but pulls his shot across the face of goal when it was surely easier to score. Rangers\u2019 two-goal cushion remains. Tavernier races down the right and crosses low for Morelos, who tries his best to miss from a couple of yards. But he sidefoots high into the net, and Rangers are in control now! This is a fine performance, albeit one inspired by the antics of Nicolas Otamendi. Spurs nearly hit back immediately, Lo Celso scampering down the left and cutting back for the sub Vinicius ... who leans back and hoicks over from ten yards. What a chance. Hello! Where did this come from? Tekpetey cuts in from the right and takes a shot. It balloons up off a defender and drops to Keseru, alone and onside. He slams past Hart from six yards. If they ask nicely, can Spurs put Kane back on? A change for Spurs at half time. Harry Kane gets a chance to kick back ahead of Sunday\u2019s game at West Bromwich Albion. Carlos Vinicius takes his place. According to the good folk at BT Sport, Kane\u2019s 200th goal, scored in his 300th game, is his 100th away from home. That\u2019s a very satisfying set of figures. Celtic: Bain, Frimpong, Duffy, Bitton, Laxalt, Brown, McGregor, Christie, Rogic, Elyounoussi, Edouard. Subs: Barkas, Taylor, Griffiths, Ajeti, Klimala, Soro, Turnbull, Ntcham, Elhamed, Henderson, Welsh, Hazard. Sparta Prague: Nita, Vindheim, Pavelka, Plechaty, Hancko, Sacek, Polidar, Karabec, Moberg Karlsson, Julis. Subs: Gabriel, Patrak, Kotek, Vitik, Celustka, Ladislav Krejci, Dockal, Lischka, Plavsic, Travnik. Celtic are unchanged. The XI who started the Scottish Cup semi-final win over Aberdeen go again. Arsenal: Leno, Maitland-Niles, Mustafi, Luiz, Kolasinac, Willian, Ceballos, Xhaka, Pepe, Willock, Nketiah. Subs: Bellerin, Tierney, Gabriel, Saka, Lacazette, Runarsson, Aubameyang, Holding, Cedric, Thomas, Elneny, Macey. Molde: Linde, Wingo, Bjornbak, Gregersen, Haugen, Aursnes, Eikrem, Hussain, Ellingsen, Omoijuanfo, Bolly. Subs: Risa, Sinyan, Mostrom, James, Craninx, Knudtzon, Christensen, Brynhildsen, Ranmark, Pedersen. Arsenal make 10 changes from Sunday\u2019s 1-0 win at Manchester United, as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Thomas Partey are rested. Only goalkeeper Bernd Leno keeps his place. Eddie Nketiah, Nicolas Pepe, Willian and Granit Xhaka are recalled, the latter as captain. All the half-time scores from the 5.55pm kick-offs: A: Roma 3-0 Cluj B: Rapid Vienna 1-1 Dundalk C: Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva 2-2 Bayer Leverkusen; Slavia Prague 2-1 Nice D: Benfica 1-2 Rangers, Lech Poznan 2-1 Standard Liege E: Omonia Nicosia 0-1 Granada; PAOK Salonika 0-1 PSV Eindhoven F: HNK Rikjeka 1-1 Napoli; Real Sociedad 0-0 AZ Alkmaar I: Sivasspor 1-0 Qarabag J: Ludogorets 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur Two own goals. One red card. Rangers are 45 minutes away from making it three out of three in Group D. Spurs have been completely dominant in Bulgaria. Harry Kane and Lucas Moura with a goal and an assist apiece. All falls quiet in Lisbon and Razgrad. Both British teams will be perfectly happy to see this through to half-time. Spurs go so close to a third. Doherty crosses deep from the right. Bale heads back across for Kane, who tries to guide a header into the top left. Too close to the keeper. Kane comes again and has a bash from a tight angle on the right. The keeper stops that one too. Spurs are enjoying themselves here. The rain is belting down in Lisbon. Benfica are soaked and looking very sorry for themselves. Rangers by contrast couldn\u2019t be happier if the sun was shining bright. Kent crosses from the left and Aribo should really do better than shouldering the ball wide right from eight yards. A firm header and it would surely have been three. Kane turns provider, as is his wont so often these days. He\u2019s pinged clear down the right. He rolls the ball across the face of the six-yard box for Lucas Moura, who can\u2019t miss. No more than Spurs deserve. All credit to Rangers, though. They refused to capitulate after that nightmare start, and now look dangerous pretty much every time they go forward. Steven Gerrard will be pleased with his team\u2019s display of moxie. Nicolas Otamendi, though. A penny for the thoughts of Manchester City supporters worldwide. It\u2019s safe to say his Benfica career hasn\u2019t started particularly well. He was at fault for a couple of goals on his debut for the club, and look what he\u2019s done now. Benfica\u2019s long unbeaten Europa League home record is in serious peril now. Morelos switches play right to left. Kamara drops a shoulder to move infield and flashes cleverly into the bottom left. Vlachodimos in the Benfica goal had no chance! Almost immediately, Rangers are level! Tavernier is sent scampering down the right. He fires low and hard into the mixer. Goncalves takes a wild swipe at the ball and shanks high into the net. It\u2019s one own goal apiece! The former Manchester City defender is sent packing, having clipped the ankles of Ryan Kent as the Rangers man skedaddled clear towards goal. He can have no complaint, though makes one anyway. The referee\u2019s not changing his mind, and off he goes. The resulting free kick is no good, but it\u2019s advantage Rangers now. Lucas Moura, who has an assist to his name having taken the corner that led to Kane\u2019s opener, nearly notches in the goal column as well. He whip-cracks a surprise daisycutter towards the bottom left. He\u2019s caught the keeper off guard, but the ball whistles inches wide of the post. A fine effort ... Tottenham\u2019s eighth of the match already. That was Kane\u2019s 200th goal in a Tottenham shirt, incidentally. He\u2019s reached the milestone in just 300 appearances. No wonder he\u2019s an official Guardian one to watch! Rangers haven\u2019t done much in attack so far. Alfredo Morelos races down the right and rolls across to Ryan Kent, who miscontrols on the edge of the Benfica D. But that\u2019s about it. Up the other end, Pizzi cut in from the left and shot across the face of goal. Inches wide with Allan McGregor beaten. Kane could have had two already. It\u2019s third time lucky as he plants a close-range header home from a left-wing corner. Spurs have been very impressive in these opening exchanges, and there\u2019s their reward. A big goal in Arsenal\u2019s group. Patrick Hoban has opened the scoring for Dundalk at Rapid Vienna in the seventh minute. Meanwhile in Bulgaria ... It\u2019s all Spurs at the minute. A free kick out on the right. Gareth Bale fancies it and stands over the ball with great purpose. He curls over the wall and back down towards the bottom right. The keeper does extremely well to tip around for a corner, with the ball moving all over the shop and dipping. Nothing comes of the corner, but in a parallel universe, Spurs are already 3-0 up. Mourinho will be happy enough with the way his players are responding to that aforementioned pre-match pep-talk. Back in Bulgaria, Kane hits the post! He creams a stunning no-backlift effort off the base of the right-hand post from 20 yards. Plamen Iliev in the Ludogorets goal was beaten all ends up, but the ball clanks away from danger. A dismal start for Rangers as Filip Helander freezes near a loose ball, allowing Rafa Silva to zip into the box on the right. He reaches the byline and cuts back, the ball clanking off Connor Goldson, who can\u2019t sort his feet out, and in. A couple of huge errors in the Rangers defence. Here we go then. Ludogorets, the champions of Bulgaria, get the match underway in Bulgaria. And inside the first 90 seconds, Harry Kane blazes over the bar when clear in the box, found by a gloriously impudent Harry Winks chip. Spurs should be leading. Steven Gerrard\u2019s pre-match patter. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive test for us, a big challenge. They\u2019ve got a very technical side. Having said that, we know what we need to do to get a result. We need to defend really well, be strong and organised, and execute ourselves when our chances come. We have full respect for Benfica, but at the same time I want my players to back themselves, I want to see personality. One or two teams have asked questions of Benfica in the games I have watched, and I want mine to do the same.\u201d Jose Mourinho tells BT Sport that he\u2019s only just spoken to his players about last week\u2019s defeat. \u201cSince that match I didn\u2019t speak about it. Only today. I tried to do it in a strong way, for their attitude to be different, and to understand that playing Spurs is a great motivation for these clubs, and if we don\u2019t match that commitment we are going to be in trouble again.\u201d Spurs could do with a result in Razgrad after last week\u2019s dismal defeat at Royal Antwerp. They\u2019ll be buoyed by Ludogorets\u2019 record against English teams: played four, lost three, drawn one. They met Arsenal in the group stages of the Champions League in 2016, going two up at home in 15 minutes before eventually losing 3-2; Arsenal stuffed them 6-0 in London. The Bulgarians did rather better against Liverpool in 2014, losing at Anfield to a last-minute penalty, and holding Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side at home. They\u2019re currently top of the Bulgarian league with a game in hand, but they\u2019re bottom of Group J having lost their first two matches. It\u2019s a big ask for Rangers this evening at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz. Benfica have a 100 percent success rate at home against visitors from Scotland, having beaten Celtic four times (1969, 2006, 2007, 2012) and Heart of Midlothian once (1960). And they\u2019ve never been beaten at home in the Europa League, a run that stretches to 24 matches, including 20 victories. On the other hand, the Light Blues have some notable recent history against Portuguese opposition: they beat both Porto and Braga in last year\u2019s competition. Also, Benfica are coming off the back of a 3-0 battering at Boavista, so hopes of maintaining their 100 percent record in Group D are far from pie in the sky. Benfica: Vlachodimos, Goncalves, Otamendi, Vertonghen, Tavares, Weigl, Rafa Silva, Pizzi, Taarabt, Everton, Seferovic. Subs: Svilar, Gilberto, Grimaldo, Pires, Nunez, Waldschmidt, Cervi, Chiquinho, Jardel, Helton Leite, Goncalo Ramos, Ferro. Rangers: McGregor, Tavernier, Goldson, Helander, Barisic, Davis, Jack, Aribo, Kamara, Morelos, Kent. Subs: Ughelumba, Hagi, Itten, Patterson, Barker, Stewart, Roofe, Balogun, McLaughlin, Barjonas, Arfield, Dickson. Two changes for Rangers, who are looking to win their tenth consecutive game in all competitions. Scott Arfield and Cedric Itten make way for Glen Kamara and Steven Davis. Ludogorets: Iliev, Ikoko, Terziev, Verdon, Nedyalkov, Badji, Abel, Manu, Cauly, Yankov, Keseru. Subs: Cicinho, Santana, Tchibota, Stoyanov, Moti, Josue Sa, Tekpetey, Mitkov, Yordanov. Tottenham Hotspur: Hart, Doherty, Alderweireld, Dier, Davies, Sissoko, Winks, Bale, Lo Celso, Lucas Moura, Kane. Subs: Lloris, Hojbjerg, Sanchez, Son, Alli, Bergwijn, Ndombele, Austin, Vinicius, Clarke, White, Cirkin. Harry Kane and Gareth Bale both start in Bulgaria. Son Heung-min gets a rest on the bench. Welcome to our rolling coverage of tonight\u2019s Europa League action. Here are the 5.55pm GMT kick-offs: A: Roma v Cluj B: Rapid Vienna v Dundalk C: Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva v Bayer Leverkusen; Slavia Prague v Nice D: Benfica v Rangers, Lech Poznan v Standard Liege E: Omonia Nicosia v Granada; PAOK Salonika v PSV Eindhoven F: HNK Rikjeka v Napoli; Real Sociedad v AZ Alkmaar I: Sivasspor v Qarabag J: Ludogorets v Tottenham Hotspur We\u2019ll be concentrating on the results of the US election Spurs and Rangers matches, but of course should fun break out elsewhere we\u2019ll keep you posted about that too. The games involving Arsenal, Celtic and Leicester City kick off at 8pm GMT, but first things first. It\u2019s Matchday Three of the 2020-21 Europa League.
