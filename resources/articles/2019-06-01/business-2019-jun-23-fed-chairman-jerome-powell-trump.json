Asked if he had considered such a move, Trump said: \u201cWell, I\u2019d be able to do that if I wanted but I haven\u2019t suggested that.\u201d Trump said that was not a threat but repeated: \u201cI have the right to do that. But I haven\u2019t said that. What he\u2019s done is $50bn a month in quantitative tightening. That\u2019s ridiculous. What he\u2019s done is he raised interest rates too fast.\u201d Bloomberg reported this week that Trump has grown frustrated with Powell and discussed removing him with advisers. Such reports have surfaced before. So have questions about whether the president has the constitutional authority to fire the chair of the independent central bank, and whether he understands the issue. On Wednesday, after a two-day Fed meeting, Powell said: \u201cI think the law is clear that I have a four-year term, and I fully intend to serve it.\u201d Trump picked Powell to lead the Fed in succession to Janet Yellen. He has consistently complained about him since. The president also attempted to place Herman Cain and Stephen Moore, political allies, on the board of the Fed. Both were beset by scandal and withdrew from the process, Moore after extensive reporting on his past behaviour by the Guardian and other outlets. On Sunday, Trump said: \u201cI think the economy\u2019s so strong we\u2019re going to bull through it. But I\u2019m not happy with his actions. No, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done a good job. I think this, if he didn\u2019t raise rates Obama had very low rates. So Obama was playing with funny money. I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m playing with the real stuff. \u201cObama had somebody that kept the rates very low. I had somebody that raised the rates very rapidly. Too much. He made a mistake. That\u2019s been proven. And yet my economy is phenomenal.\u201d On Wednesday, the Fed said it was ready to implement interest rate cuts as early as next month, in attempt to address growing economic risks in the US and abroad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
