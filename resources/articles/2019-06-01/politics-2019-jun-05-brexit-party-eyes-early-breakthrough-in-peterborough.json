And in a further sign of the fast-shifting fault lines of British politics, while Labour hopes it can retain the seat, the Conservatives, who held it for 12 years until 2017, are widely thought to be completely out of the running. Thursday\u2019s contest seems likely to hinge on two contrasting strengths: the Brexit party\u2019s wave of popular support since last month\u2019s European elections versus Labour\u2019s established campaigning infrastructure. The Brexit party candidate, local entrepreneur Mike Greene, concedes that the lack of election experience and voter knowledge is proving tricky. \u201cIn an ideal world we\u2019d have had that,\u201d he says, taking a brief coffee break around the corner from a campaign headquarters crammed with cyan-rosetted volunteers. \u201cThe positive is that we\u2019ve knocked on doors with an open mind, not knowing who were were going to speak to, and having a proper engagement with them.\u201d While bookmakers have Labour on odds as long as 6/1, a local source for the party insisted things were still \u201cvery, very close\u201d. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s all about the get-out-the-vote operation,\u201d they said. \u201cOur vote seems to be there, but we need to get people out, and that can be tough in a byelection.\u201d Labour faces other challenges. The poll was triggered when Fiona Onasanya, who took the seat for the party in 2017, was ousted by a recall petition after her conviction for lying about a speeding ticket. The new candidate, Lisa Forbes, is local and experienced \u2013 she came second in Peterborough in the 2015 general election \u2013 but has been criticised by Jewish groups for liking a tweet that said Theresa May had a \u201cZionist slave masters agenda\u201d. While the Conservatives have been somewhat ignored amid all this, Wayne Fitzgerald, who chairs the constituency party and is deputy leader of Peterborough council, insists they are still in the fight. The Brexit party, he accepts, received a \u201ctsunami of support\u201d at the European elections: \u201cThe question is whether or not they can build on this \u2013 turn out people who would otherwise be watching TV, the people who only vote every now and then.\u201d But it is undeniably a difficult time for the Conservatives. At a heavily staffed Brexit party stall in the centre of Peterborough, John Stanyer, a former local Tory party chair who has left his Cumbria home for a week of volunteering, says he has bumped into several other ex-Tories. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with them on a dozen campaigns for the Conservatives and they\u2019re now all here, working for the Brexit party,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to lose that quality of people, the activists on the ground. When a party does that, at some point it reaches a critical point.\u201d Stanyer is utterly convinced Greene will triumph on Thursday: \u201cIt\u2019s been like shooting fish in a barrel. I might end up looking like a complete idiot, but that\u2019s how it feels.\u201d Also potentially being squeezed are the resurgent Liberal Democrats, and some Labour staffers predict that if Forbes does win it could be down to Lib Dem voters temporarily switching sides. Chris Porsz, walking past the Labour stall in the city centre, voted Lib Dem in the European elections. As the son of Polish parents, a former paratrooper and a Holocaust survivor, who settled in Peterborough in 1947 he backs \u201ca free, united, peaceful Europe\u201d. \u201cBut I might well vote Labour this time,\u201d Porsz says. \u201cA big part of that would be trying to stop the Brexit party.\u201d If Farage\u2019s group does win it will mean not only a new political voice in Westminster but one represented by a self-professed novice. Greene signed up to the Brexit party only four weeks ago after he was approached to stand by its chair, Richard Tice, and is still getting used to the media attention \u2013 he is smarting after the Observer described him as a \u201cKeith Chegwin lookalike\u201d. While the party still has no policies beyond a no-deal Brexit, Greene is standing on a self-penned \u201cfour pledges for Peterborough\u201d, promising to prioritise schools, further education, housing and jobs in the city, and to resist any party whipping which would go against these. The specifics are, however, somewhat thin, and Greene concedes he has much to learn even on Brexit-related matters such as the Irish border. \u201cWe\u2019re a new party, seven weeks old. If I\u2019m successful I\u2019ll be a really new politician \u2013 I\u2019ve only been in politics four weeks. But there\u2019s a lot of people in the party with strong experience,\u201d he says. \u201cI will be defaulting to the experience and expertise of that team. I\u2019m not an expert on many of those issues. And I\u2019m happy to say that.\u201d \u2022 The subheading on this article was amended on 6 June 2019 because an earlier version referred to the Brexit party being formed eight weeks ago. It was registered with the Electoral Commission on 5 February, and as the article itself says, it was publicly launched eight weeks ago.
