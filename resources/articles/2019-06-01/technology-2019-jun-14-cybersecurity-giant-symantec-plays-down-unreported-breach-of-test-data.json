The list extracted in the February incident, seen by Guardian Australia, suggests that all major federal government departments were among the targets of a hacker who also claimed to be responsible for Medicare data being available for sale on the dark web. But Symantec said the \u201cminor incident\u201d involved \u201can isolated, self-enclosed demo lab in Australia \u2013 not connected to Symantec\u2019s corporate network \u2013 used to [demonstrate] various Symantec security solutions and how they work together\u201d. The incident was not reported because Symantec concluded that \u201cno sensitive personal data was hosted in or extracted from this demo lab, nor were Symantec\u2019s corporate network, email accounts, products or solutions compromised\u201d. The hacker extracted a list of purported clients of Symantec\u2019s CloudSOC services, account managers and account numbers \u2013 but Symantec insists data contained in the system were \u201cdummy e-mails and a small number of low-level and non-sensitive files for demonstration purposes\u201d in a demo lab \u201cnot used for production purposes\u201d. The list of purported clients includes the Australian federal police, the big four banks, insurers, universities, retailers and departments in the New South Wales and federal public service. \u201cThis is an old list of some of the largest public and private entities in Australia \u2013 it was in the environment for testing purposes,\u201d a Symantec spokeswoman said. \u201cThese entities are not necessarily Symantec customers, nor do we necessarily host services for them.\u201d Several federal departments, including infrastructure, industry, human services and finance, confirmed that they do not use Symantec\u2019s CloudSOC services and do not store information with Symantec. But Guardian Australia understands that others queried the \u201cminor\u201d breach with Symantec because they are customers. The Department of Social Services said it \u201cuses Symantec products including CloudSOC, in line with Australian Cyber Security Centre best practice\u201d. \u201cThe product in question is not used by the department to store customer, or sensitive information.\u201d In a statement the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development noted the department name referenced in the list was \u201cdiscontinued in 2013\u201d. \u201cWe have received no notice from Symantec regarding this matter, but we will make contact in relation to their continued use, if any, of our department name.\u201d In a statement the Department of Home Affairs said it \u201cdoes not use the Symantec CloudSOC services, however does use a number of other Symantec products on the department\u2019s internal network, that are managed by departmental staff\u201d. \u201cThe department does not have any sensitive information that is held by Symantec. \u201cInformation held by Symantec would relate to Symantec\u2019s commercial relationship with the department, which is publicly available information.\u201d The departments of agriculture, education, employment, communication and arts said they used other Symantec products, but not cloud services, and did not store information with Symantec. Education also said it would \u201cmake contact in relation to their use of our department name\u201d. The Australian Privacy Act creates a scheme for compulsory notification when a data breach is likely to result in serious harm to individuals whose personal information is involved in the breach. The Symantec spokeswoman said it treated \u201cany cybersecurity incident \u2013 regardless of its scope or severity \u2013 with the utmost priority and take great caution in complying with the laws of the countries in which we do business around the world\u201d. \u201cConsistent with our internal policies and guidance, which align with national and international data protection laws, no sensitive personal data or information has been disclosed that would trigger any regulatory obligations, but Symantec will continue to take appropriate remediation efforts if the situation changes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
