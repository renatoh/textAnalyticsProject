Mr Dyke said the disruption caused by the power cut had been worse than when a Real IRA bomb was detonated outside TV Centre in 2001, because then the BBC news operation was able to switch to its back up facilities without a hitch. The double system failure just before 8am today took all live news services off air, including BBC News 24, Radio 4's Today programme and BBC Radio 5 Live's breakfast show. \"Something has blown the whole lot. I think that this has happened before - this is the third time in four years. What is amazing in these circumstances is how professionally the thing moves on,\" Mr Dyke said today. \"There will be a few questions asked about how something not only blew the transmission in London, but blew the backup system as well. Well, hang on, that's why I thought we had backup systems, to avoid [this happening]. So there will be a few questions asked when I get back,\" he added. Mr Dyke recalled being at TV Centre when the Real IRA bomb struck in 2001. \"I was there when we had the bomb and watched the whole news operation move across London into the backup facility, putting out the news as if nothing had happened,\" he said. The head of BBC TV news programmes, Roger Mosey, phoned Mr Dyke this afternoon with more bad news - that the relaunch of News 24 would have to be postponed by a week because of the power cut. \"It's sod's law,\" Mr Dyke said. Mr Dyke was speaking at the University of York where it was announced this afternoon that he would replace opera singer Dame Janet Baker as its new Chancellor. He graduated from York university in 1974 with a degree in politics. \"York University took a risk when they enrolled me as a mature student with my one grade E A level. Going there changed my life, for which I've always been grateful. I hope by taking on this role I can help repay the debt I owe the university,\" Mr Dyke said. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
