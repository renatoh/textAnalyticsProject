In 2016, Norwegian author Vigdis Hjorth published her novel Arv og Milj\u00f8, which appeared in English this year as Will and Testament, translated by Charlotte Barslund. The story of Bergljot, who has severed all ties with her family because they refuse to believe that her father sexually abused her as a child, was hailed by critics and readers alike and read as pure fiction \u2013 until the Norwegian daily Aftenposten revealed that extracts from private family documents had been transplanted verbatim into the novel. Was Hjorth, who has written autobiographically in the past, indirectly accusing her own father? Hjorth has never said Will and Testament is autobiographical, insisting the novel is as much about being silenced as it is about incest. But the revelation sparked widespread discussion around the ethics of writing about recognisable people, which peaked in 2017 when Hjorth\u2019s sister Helga published a novel of her own. Titled Fri vilje (Free Will), it follows a woman named Nina who is shocked when she is made into a character in her sister Vera\u2019s novel about family conflict and incest. It is not the first time that a work of autofiction has received a reply in book form. In 2018, when French author \u00c9douard Louis published Qui a tu\u00e9 mon p\u00e8re (Who Killed My Father), he named several members of the French political elite who, he claimed, had indirectly caused his father\u2019s death by dismantling social services. Politician Martin Hirsch, one of those accused, then published a novel titled How I Killed His Father. Norway\u2019s biggest contemporary literary export, Karl Ove Knausgaard, similarly came under intense scrutiny when he used real names throughout the six candid volumes of his memoir-novel hybrid My Struggle. His first ex-wife, Tonje Aursland, produced a radio documentary titled Tonje\u2019s Version, which detailed her experience of involuntarily becoming a character. Knausgaard followed My Struggle with the Seasonal Quartet, published in Norway between 2015 and 2016. Last month his second wife, Linda Bostr\u00f6m Knausgaard, herself a successful writer, published Oktoberbarn (October Children) in Sweden, her take on events depicted in Knausgaard\u2019s Spring and Summer. However, October Children does not negate her ex-husband\u2019s book \u2013 rather, their writing now appears to be in dialogue. Karl Ove writes in Summer that the couple agreed to separate; in Oktoberbarn, Linda claims that it was his decision. Her first openly autobiographical book therefore becomes an act of self-examination powerful enough to match if not surpass those of her ex-husband\u2019s. Dedicated to the Hjorth sisters\u2019 parents, Helga Hjorth\u2019s Free Will was written expressly to discredit her sister\u2019s work. \u201cThe only way to regain balance would be for you to express yourself through a work of literature as well, to write a novel,\u201d Nina tells herself in the book, hoping to invalidate Vera\u2019s version and defend her parents\u2019 honour. But in her eagerness to negate her sister\u2019s book, Helga Hjorth forces an autobiographical reading of Will and Testament that Vigdis says she never intended. Ironically, Free Will could be seen to confirm the descriptions in Will and Testament of a family almost manic in their determination to discredit their accuser. When the latter book was adapted into a successful play at the National Stage in Bergen last year, Vigdis\u2019s mother sued the theatre. The theatre\u2019s response could sum up this whole debate: \u201cThe autobiographical interpretation is just that \u2013 an interpretation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
