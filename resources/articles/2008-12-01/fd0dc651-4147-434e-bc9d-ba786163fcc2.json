Instead, enjoy a selection of our favourite interviews from 2008; Vampire Weekend, Nas, Anton Newcombe, the Ragga Twins, No Age, Elbow and We Are Scientists are just some of our personal highlights. Over the past 12 months we've interviewed the likes of Little Boots, Portishead and Roots Manuva. We've been from Mali to Texas, from Glastonbury to Reading, and you can find every listenable minute of it here. Thanks for all your feedback on the blog this year, we've loved (nearly) every minute of it and we hope you'll be back right here next week for our first show of 2009, featuring tips and salutations from Tim Jonze and Alexis Petridis. Merry Christmas, and a podding new year!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
