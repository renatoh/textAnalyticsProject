In a series of three experiments, led by Richard Levenson, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of California Davis Medical Center, it was found that pigeons have the capacity to learn how to identify whether an image shows healthy or cancerous breast tissue. The birds \u201cshare many visual system properties with humans\u201d, according to the study. During the first experiment, eight pigeons were presented with 144 breast tissue images, at various levels of magnification and with and without color. The birds could then peck a blue or yellow button on either side of each image, to indicate whether it was cancerous or healthy. If they chose correctly, they were rewarded with food but if they chose incorrectly, they were presented with the image again and again until they correctly identified it. \u201cWith some training and selective food reinforcement, pigeons do just as well as humans in categorizing digitized slides and mammograms of benign and malignant human breast tissue,\u201d Levenson told the International Business Times. After 15 days of training, the birds\u2019 accuracy rate had risen from 50% to 85%. The pigeons were then presented with new images to rule out memorization as a possible cause for their success. They correctly identified the familiar and novel images 87% and 85% of the time. When researchers combined the birds\u2019 responses, a method they called \u201cflock sourcing\u201d, rather than scoring them individually, they found that their accuracy increased to 99%. \u201cThe pigeons were able to generalize what they had learned, so that when we showed them a completely new set of normal and cancerous digitized slides, they correctly identified them,\u201d Levenson said. The second experiment was similarly successful. Four new birds were tested to see if they could identify micro-calcifications \u2013 calcium deposits that are associated with the presence of cancer \u2013 in breast tissue. Within 14 days, their accuracy rate rose from 50% to over 85%. The final experiment had another four birds attempt to identify masses in mammograms. While the pigeons were able to identify masses in images they had already seen with some success \u2013 two pigeons reached 80% correct classification and two reached 60% \u2013 they could not identify masses as benign or malignant in new images. According to the study, this can also be very challenging for humans. A panel of radiologists previously tested reached an 80% accuracy rate when viewing the same images. \u201cThese images have a lot to do with the edges of masses and how irregular they are, as well as the density of the masses,\u201d Edward Wasserman, professor of experimental psychology at the University of Iowa and co-author of the study, told the Sacramento Bee. \u201cIdentifying that is really tough to do. This is why people spend years perfecting the skill.\u201d The results suggest that pigeons could be involved in helping researchers and engineers evaluate new medical imaging techniques as they continue to innovate, according to Levenson. \u201cPigeons may not be able to write poetry, but they\u2019ve had millions of years to develop the abilities that they need to navigate a very complicated and dangerous world,\u201d Levenson told the Smithsonian magazine. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t surprise me that they can do pathology!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
