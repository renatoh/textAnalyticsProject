Joe Howlett, from Campobello Island, New Brunswick, boarded a vessel off the province\u2019s eastern coast on Monday to help rescue a north Atlantic right whale that had become heavily tangled in rope. The rescue was steeped in urgency: in the past month, seven north Atlantic right whales have been found floating lifelessly in the Gulf of St Lawrence, off Canada. With a global population believed to be around 525, the string of deaths suggests that more than 1% of the population has died in recent weeks. Howlett helped free the whale \u2013 only to be struck by the mammal moments later, said Mackie Green of the Campobello Whale Rescue Team. \u201cThey got the whale totally disentangled and then some kind of freak thing happened and the whale made a big flip,\u201d Green, who was not onboard the vessel, told the Canadian Press. Howlett had previously saved some two dozen whales over the past 15 years, making use of his deep knowledge of knots and ropes to set the huge mammals free. Just a few days before his death, Howlett had helped liberate another north Atlantic right whale in the region, cutting away a fishing line caught in its mouth. \u201cJoe definitely would not want us to stop because of this,\u201d said Green, who joined forces with Howlett to launch the whale rescue in 2002. \u201cThis is something he loved and there\u2019s no better feeling than getting a whale untangled, and I know how good he was feeling after cutting that whale clear.\u201d On Tuesday, the federal fisheries department confirmed that Howlett had been killed while on one of its vessels, describing him as an \u201cirreplaceable member of the whale rescue community\u201d. In a statement, the department offered its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the father of two. \u201cTaking part in whale rescue operations requires immense bravery and a passion for the welfare of marine mammals,\u201d it noted. \u201cThere are serious risks involved with any disentanglement attempt. Each situation is unique, and entangled whales can be unpredictable.\u201d Howlett\u2019s death comes amid the unprecedented loss of seven north Atlantic right whales in the past month. A team included marine biologists, federal scientists and pathologists, among others, have been racing to figure out why the whales \u2013 which live along the eastern seaboard of Canada and the US and can reach up to 16 metres (50ft) in length \u2013 are dying in large numbers. Last week, they carried out necropsies on three of the seven whales, hoping to find clues before the carcasses decompose. While their findings are still preliminary and don\u2019t explain why the deaths have seemingly occurred within such a short time frame, they found signs of severe blunt trauma and bruising on two of the whales, suggesting collision with a vessel, while the third had been tangled in fishing gear for weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
