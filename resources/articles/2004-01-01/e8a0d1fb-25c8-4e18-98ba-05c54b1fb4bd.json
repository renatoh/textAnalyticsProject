The Olympic lottery bill cleared its second reading debate in the Commons yesterday with just five votes against. The move to establish Olympic-themed lottery games to raise \u00a3750m for the Olympics sparked controversy among charities who fear it will eat into the proceeds of existing lottery games - and the 28p in every \u00a31 that goes to good causes - cutting the good cause money by an estimated \u00a364m a year. Another \u00a3410m is set to be diverted from existing good causes to fund the Olympics after 2009 when the current lottery operating license expires. Olympic lottery games will also mean that for the first time, players will in effect choose where lottery money goes by deciding to buy \"Olympic\" lottery tickets rather than the other games, setting a precedent for lottery cash to be tied to particular causes. Voluntary sector organisations have warned that allowing lottery players to 'vote' on where the money goes could damage smaller, less well known charities. But these concerns were barely reflected in a parliamentary debate marked by general enthusiasm for the Olympics. Liberal Democrat culture spokesman Don Foster said he was \"conscious of the many worries... about the likely impact of such a move on other good causes and the fact that the measure represents further government interference in the way in which lottery funds are distributed\". But he gave his backing to the bill, arguing that \"exceptions must be made at times when the entire UK comes together to celebrate and promote what our country has to offer\". Conservative James Paice argued that the Olympic lottery games should begin in the summer to tap the interest generated by the Athens Olympics - a move that the International Olympic Committee has ruled out - instead of waiting until the host city for the 2012 Olympics is announced. He also called for the government's 12% tax take from the Olympic lottery games to be hypothecated to fund the Olympics - a suggestion that echoes the National Council for Voluntary Organisations' call for the tax raised by existing lottery games to be handed back by the government and split between good causes and lottery prize payouts. The sports minister, Richard Caborn, confirmed that the Olympic lottery would cause a \"displacement\" of 5% of good cause money. He said MPs had \"rightly\" raised this \"important\" point. He added: \"Broadly speaking, we have agreed with the other good causes that it is right, in the national interest, to use the lottery for the Olympics.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
