Already the corporation is bracing itself to write a cheque for up to \u00a310 million to an obscure diamond mining firm after falsely linking it with Osama bin Laden. But The Observer has learnt that the eventual figure could be millions more than this if the diamond firm, Oryx Natural Resources, has its way. And despite costing licence-fee payers enough to make almost two series of the acclaimed Walking With Beasts, still no one is clear why the BBC tried to fight an action it must have known it couldn't win. For nine months it stonewalled, hiring expensive lawyers and investigators in a desperate bid to force Oryx to drop its claim. But last week the corporation's legal team admitted it had no defence, and the London High Court awarded judgment and costs to Oryx. Damages will be determined later this year. The story of how the world's most respected newsgathering organisation ended up linking a hitherto unheard of mining firm based in the Democratic Republic of Congo to America's most wanted makes for a post-modern Scoop! It is a tale that has everything: international terrorism, stock markets, multi-million-dollar deals, ambitious news editors looking to make their mark, and a monumentally annoyed Greg Dyke. It is also a cautionary tale for all journalists. Back in the summer of last year, the BBC's News at 10 editor, Mark Popescu, was encouraging his reporters to break big stories. The idea was to make the news rather than simply report it. This approach went exponential on 11 September. One consequence of the worst terrorist attack on American soil was the plunge in world stock markets. Amid the chaos, questions were asked as to how Bin Laden had financed such a terrifying strike. It transpired that the man who held only contempt for western capitalism was rather partial to making money himself, operating a sophisticated web of money-laundering firms that flushed cash between genuine and fake businesses. Suddenly the links between big business and international terrorism became terribly interesting. Enter Brian Johnson-Thomas, a self proclaimed diamond expert and investigative journalist with a number of groundbreaking stories to his credit. Johnson-Thomas had unearthed what he claimed was a startling fact. He had documents proving that Mohamed Kalfhan, a close ally of Bin Laden who had been jailed for his part in bombing the US embassies in Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi, owned 1 per cent of Oryx's Congolese mine. Despite its relative obscurity, Oryx was already known to some in the City. It had tried to float on the UK stock market but the move had been pulled amid claims that a company closely linked to Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe held a 20 per cent stake in the firm. So it seemed that Osama bin Laden had come within a whisker of pulling off a major financial coup. To David Shukman, a respected BBC reporter, the information was manna from heaven and he assembled a team to investigate. Producing the lengthy news item, which was broadcast on 31 October, took more than six weeks. Interviews were set up with Johnson-Thomas and Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain, who has in the past campaigned against 'blood' diamonds - gems mined in conflict areas. However, at no time did the corporation contact Oryx. Eventually, a few days before the story was broadcast, a junior BBC researcher fired off an email containing a series of vague allegations to an associate of an Oryx non-executive director in New York. It was to prove a costly error. The Kalfhan who was listed as a shareholder in Oryx was not Bin Laden's ally. There was no link between the company and terrorism. Geoffrey White, Oryx Mining's managing director, was appalled: 'This feature wasn't put together in 10 minutes. There was ample opportunity for them to get in touch.' Within hours of the broadcast, Oryx's world exploded. The telephones at its parent company in Oman barely stopped ringing. The company's chairman, Thamar Al Shanfari, one of Oman's best-known businessmen, found himself in the limelight. Oryx, which runs hotels and car dealerships in Oman, claims business started to dry up. Financing and equipment for the mining operation in the Congo was pulled. Oryx had invested more than $100 million in the mine, two schools, a health clinic and 370 kilometres of road. Even when the BBC ran a full apology three weeks later, Oryx found itself out in the cold. 'People would think, well, there's no smoke without fire,' White said. Despite the apology, Oryx believed it had suffered huge damage to its reputation, and its business had been severely disrupted. On the advice of its lawyers, Mishcon de Reya, Oryx appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct a forensic comb through its accounts and independently evaluate how much the BBC feature had cost the company. It is understood that this figure comes to around \u00a310m, a claim hotly disputed by the BBC. 'Their case on financial loss keeps changing and is riddled with inconsistencies,' thundered a press release. We consider the amount claimed highly speculative and without real foundation.' But, in a double blow to the corporation, it has emerged Oryx will, over the next fortnight, appoint brand experts to gauge the cost of the damage to its reputation. 'It's difficult to work out, but we won't include it in the overall claim until we're confident it's justifiable,' White said. Legal experts believe the reputational claim will be for several million pounds. This suggests Oryx could claim for damages totalling as much as \u00a315m. Perhaps it was the size of the potential damages that caused the BBC to launch such a robust defence. But, having apologised live on air, such tactics were incoherent. Initially the corporation pleaded a defence of 'qualified privilege', arguing it had acted in good faith. But its failure to put the allegations to Oryx undermined such a defence. The corporation was left having to argue that linking Oryx to a man responsible for the death of more than 2,800 civilians was not defamatory. 'It was apparent pretty early on that they had no defence. We were slightly surprised that this has gone for as long as it did,' said James Libson of Mishcon de Reya. But still the BBC held out. A frustrated Dyke is believed to have telephoned White to persuade him to drop the action. And, in a move that smacked of desperation, the corporation appointed Control Risks, an investigative firm, to look into Oryx's affairs. The hope appears to have been that the sleuths would uncover something so unpleasant, Oryx would be unable to claim it had a reputation to defame. But the investigators failed. Hours before the case was due to be heard in court, Auntie capitulated. White said: 'The BBC spent nine months trying to come up with something but they didn't think of the costs to the licence-fee payer. They went off on an ego trip.' The hard-to-avoid conclusion is that if Auntie hadn't tried to play hardball, a speedier solution might have been found, licence-fee payers would not have seen so much of their cash squandered, and the corporation's good name would not have been dragged through the courts and into the press. Even now White is still not clear how the initial mix-up occurred. 'I'd still like an explanation as to what happened.' Dyke would probably agree."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
