So many people moaning of biliousness and persisting in detox, so much of winter left to slog through, no festivities but Valentine's Day to puncture the horizon. (Might it be possible to invent a weapon that annihilated anyone sitting underneath a red, heart-shaped balloon and/or drinking pink sparkling wine on February 14? Can we at least try?) As far as drinking goes, the only answer is to console yourself with old favourites, while at the same time interesting the mind just a tiny bit with wines that stretch the boundaries. I'm not talking about anything too outlandish or beyond the comfort zone; there are no Chinese wines, no Uruguayan tannat, no highbrow concoction from vineyards on the slopes of Mount Etna that requires you to have a PhD in extreme terroir if you are fully to understand and appreciate it. This week's four wines are genuinely useful and pleasant ones to have around. Of the whites, one is a take on pinot grigio, a grape so popular that its sales seem almost to be growing exponentially; another is a revitalising sauvignon blanc from an unexpected place. Of the reds, the carignan is the more unusual. It's made from old (in this case, 55-year-old) vines, which generally give a wine more intensity and complexity; and, given its age, it is a real curiosity, albeit a very accessible one. The Portuguese red I've slipped in because I think it's easy to forget how well Portugal does wines that seem pitched somewhere closer to the old but that are moving towards the new world. That is, wines with structural rigour and just a tinge of what I like to call dirt, but also a sturdy fullness that delivers a good punch of flavour and is anything but thin. Happy January. Loncomilla Carignan 2001, Chile \u00a39.99, Marks &amp; Spencer, 14% abv Carignan is plentiful in southern France, where it is often derided as a workhorse grape; even its supporters seem proudest of wines in which you can't 'identify' the carignan. They'd like this unusual, delicious example. The smell is extraordinary - vivid black, thyme-marinated olives, then on to ripe black fruit with well-integrated American oak. And look at the age - approaching seven years and it carries it so well. Pick up the olive notes with a herby beef and olive casserole. Tiefenbrunner 'Kirchleiten' Sauvignon Blanc 2006, Italy \u00a311.48, Armit, 13.5% abv The Alto Adige, formerly part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, was annexed to Italy at the end of the first world war. Italian and German are official languages, hence this wine's un-Latin-sounding name. Italy isn't exactly known for its sauvignon blanc, but this is minerallic, sculpted, streamlined, herbaceous, and as bracing as the mountain air in which it's grown. On its own, or with asparagus, smoked fish or crustaceans. Masi Masianco 2006, Italy \u00a37.99, Tesco, 13% abv Pinot grigio (well, mostly), but not as you know it. Made in the Veneto, this has more roundness and hinterland than you'd think, while retaining a cool, lagoon feel. Masi call it a 'super-Venetian' because it is given extra body and luxury by blending the pinot grigio with 25% verduzzo that has dried on racks for three weeks after being picked. With Venetian seafood - platters of shellfish or cool risotti. Altano 2005 Douro, Portugal \u00a34.99, Waitrose; \u00a34.75, Wine Society; 13% abv Portugal is often forgotten about by all but aficionados. The current favourite buy of my parents, this wine is made among the port vineyards of the Douro valley, from two port varieties, tinto roriz (tempranillo) and touriga francesa. It's medium-bodied, with red berry flavours, and considerably less bland than many usual suspects at this price. An easy-going wine - tapas would be good, or griddled chops."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
