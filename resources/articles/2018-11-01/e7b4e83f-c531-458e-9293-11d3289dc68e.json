As England\u2019s second-choice keeper since her debut in 2013, this is the first World Cup in which Jones will take the gloves in every match, an opportunity that was handed to her when it was decided six weeks before the tournament that Sarah Taylor would not travel for health reasons. \u201cIt is what I have wanted to do for a while now so I am really enjoying this opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has always been a bit of an uphill battle with Sarah [Taylor] being as good as she is but I\u2019ve always worked really hard on my keeping.\u201d \u201c I have played the odd game in World Cups and finals but as it stands it is looking like I will play a part throughout this. It is such a great opportunity for me to show everyone what I can do.\u201d So far, she is certainly living up to coach Mark Robinson\u2019s pre-tournament billing of her as \u201cthe best keeper in the world after Taylor\u201d. Her glove work against Bangladesh was impeccable, including a superb diving catch to dismiss Bangladesh\u2019s number three Fargana Hoque. Former England wicketkeeper Jack Russell is also now a fan, having tweeted during Monday\u2019s match that she \u201chas good technique and looks sharp and natural\u201d behind the stumps. \u201cI saw that afterwards, it was really cool!,\u201d Jones said. \u201cObviously, he is a wicketkeeping legend so it was brilliant.\u201d England\u2019s next match is on Friday against South Africa, who beat Sri Lanka by seven wickets on Monday, putting them in pole position in the group. \u201cIt is looking like the South Africa game will be a big one,\u201d agreed Jones. \u201cThey have got some very dangerous players and having played them in the summer a lot both teams know each other very well. You can\u2019t underestimate them, but I think we know how to bowl to them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
