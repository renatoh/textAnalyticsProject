Please mind the gap between the political platform and the contractual practice. Trouble for the tube maintenance firm Metronet has been on its way for almost as long as a delayed District line train, but yesterday it finally arrived. The private contractor in charge of renewing and improving two-thirds of the London Underground was defeated in its application for an urgent injection of public cash. What Metronet wanted was \u00a3551m; what it got was \u00a3121m. Even that fraction was granted very reluctantly by the regulator. Chris Bolt is an economist with long experience in privatisation. He is not by any means a basher of PLCs, but his chastisement of Metronet was stronger than the standard regulatorese: \"If they had been delivering properly they would have had cash in the bank, not these debts.\" That was almost as stark as the prospect of Metronet's collapse. The company is already over budget by \u00a32bn; three of its consortium of five shareholders (which include some of the biggest names in the infrastructure business) have written off their investments, and it bleeds money. So who was responsible for creating this mess? Step forward, the new man in No 10. During his long stint next door, Mr Brown effectively forced through the part-privatisation of London's tube system. He overrode opposition in favour of a bunch of consultants, lawyers and business people, all eager to offer their advice and billable hours. Mr Brown did not want to hand over too much power to London's new mayor and old maverick, Ken Livingstone - he liked the idea of drafting in the private sector, and his tight fiscal rules limited his spending power. The \u00a330bn public-private partnership (PPP) to run the creaky underground scratched all those itches at once. Except that, for both the public and private sectors, PPP has become the gift that keeps on taking. Through what misty eyes must Chancellor Brown, in his 1998 spending review, have seen that his new device would \"remove the need for public subsidy from 2000-01\" and how disappointed must he be now, as the entire system perches on the edge of collapse - with billions of pounds in costs and liabilities about to revert to the public pot. Poorly drafted contracts mean no one is entirely sure who will pick up the bill. Indeed the government appears barely to have foreseen that its private-sector partner could go bust. Public services can sometimes be improved by private involvement, but one lesson from Mr Brown's romance gone wrong must be that it is not always an answer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
