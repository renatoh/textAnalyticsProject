It took the ski-mad Catalans a further eight years to earn their first point in a competitive match but they did so in style on October 13 2004 when Marc Bernaus's goal, the first the team had scored from open play in more than two years, secured a 1-0 World Cup qualifying group victory over Macedonia. The tax haven has a population of only 70,000 but the 69,884 Andorrans still abed held their manhoods cheap when the happy few who witnessed it in a crowd of 116 cried God for Marc, Andorra and Our Lady of Meritxell. \"I am looking forward to looking at the table and seeing Andorra's name absent from the bottom,\" said the goalkeeper Koldo who in 2003, on Uefa's 50th anniversary, was named Andorra's Golden Player despite conceding an average of three goals per game. \"This will take a few days to sink in,\" said the player known to his wife, family and 116 fans as \"officially the greatest player in Andorra's history\". Although an 8-1 thrashing by the Czech Republic later removed some of the gloss, as did criticism from managers over their wild tackling - Andorra received more red and yellow cards in qualification than any other European team - they held Macedonia to a draw in Skopje and ended their campaign by drawing with Finland in front of a fortress Estadi Communal crowd swollen to 300 by 184 glory seekers. Unfortunately Bernaus will not play at Old Trafford as the Andorran federation, Claude Makelele take note, have agreed with his Spanish second division club Elche that his club career takes precedence and they are due to play Albacete on Sunday evening. The only other professional the manager David Rodrigo can call on, Ildefons Lima of the Serie B club Triestina, is suspended having been banned for six matches for spitting in an opponent's face in last October's defeat to Armenia. Their midfield replacements include the nation's most-capped player Oscar Sonejee, an insurance salesman. He also played eight years ago in Andorra's first great display when they held Brazil to a winning margin of only three and stopped the svelte version of Ronaldo from scoring in the sele\u00e7ao's last match before the 1998 World Cup. A week later Brazil scored only one goal fewer against Scotland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
