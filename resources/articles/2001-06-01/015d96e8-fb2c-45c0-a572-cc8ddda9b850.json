Nine thousand hectares (22,000 acres) in the Buckinghamshire countryside were assigned to the new development. Three years later, a master plan laid down a framework which would structure the lives of the city's eventual 200,000 residents and lead to prolonged derision of its clinical design - a grid system, with some 200 roundabouts and wide, anonymous boulevards carrying names such as H5, H6 and H7. But now the city is back on the drawing board - and searching for its soul. The planner's challenge, this time round, is not only to give central Milton Keynes a makeover worth hundreds of millions of pounds, but to imbue it with a heart by creating a focal point. Nearly everyone, including those who live there, agrees: Milton Keynes lacks a sense of place. \"The city centre is a city without a proper centre. There is no heart that you could say: 'From here beats the life of Milton Keynes',\" admits Andrew Jones, a planning director with international development consultants Edaw. Jones's company has been commissioned to draw up proposals on the future shape of the centre, to last for the next 20 or 30 years. The new development framework covers an area of about 200 hectares (494 acres). Also appointed to the master planning team is artist and sculptor Thomas Heatherwick. His role is to interpret the future visually and he has a lot of space to play with: surprisingly, even after 30 years, a third of the city still remains undeveloped. Jones says: \"For many people, the centre is not a place to enjoy. Public spaces are often windy and unpleasant. It has a mile-long shopping complex, business parks and some high quality buildings, but there are few exciting or landmark buildings to define the city centre for residents, or help the visitor to navigate their way around an unfamiliar town. The review will address these issues.\" At the end of this year, after nine months' public consultation, the planners will hand the finished product to Milton Keynes council and regeneration and development agency English Partnerships, which owns most of the undeveloped land in the city. Pauline Scott-Garrett, head of arts and culture at the council says: \"Thirty years ago, there was a clear vision and set of ambitions put down on paper and used as a planning framework. Everyone recognises now that it needs to be refreshed, updated, in part renewed and reinvented, because life has changed and moved on.\" A key component to bringing Milton Keynes into the 21st century will be an injection of people into the core. At present, approximately 1,500 people live there. After working hours, the place shuts down and is all but deserted. Jones says: \"We want to bring in a population that starts to create a new market for urban living - as has been the case in every other major city. Their presence will start to bring new life and diversity into the centre.\" Some 6,000 new homes are planned for central Milton Keynes. The new inner-city dwellers will be accommodated in a mix of residential and retail properties. And it is anticipated that their presence, and expectations, will add a new layer of cultural vitality to the place, in the shape of music venues, bars, restaurants, nightclubs and fringe theatres. There are also plans to establish a new university and create lifelong learning opportunities. This comes as De Montfort University, which opened a site in Milton Keynes in 1992, announced plans to close it again in two years after failing to attract enough students. The city is home to the Open University, the biggest teaching institution in the country, but its campus has no students. Jones says: \"We want to bring in a student body, which will give us the alternative cultures, the layers of unconformity and the sharper edges that go to make up the personality of a city.\" It would be wrong to assume that Milton Keynes is not already a successful city. When built, it was one of many post-war developments designed to ease the economic and population burden on major cities. Years later, this ambitious project has outstripped its contemporaries, such as Stevenage and Crawley in south-east England, Telford in the West Midlands and Warrington in the north-west. The city's economic growth over the past three decades has been rapid and considerable: registered unemployment currently stands at less than 2% of the total workforce. When the area was first designated a new town, the region's population was 44,000. Most lived in the established settlements of Bletchley, Wolverton, Stony Stratford, New Bradwell and a few other small hamlets, including Milton Keynes village, which were incorporated into the ma trix of Milton Keynes. Today the population is almost five times as great and 46% of residents are under 30. Scott-Garrett says: \"We're already on to a winner. And what we want to do now is shape it and harness the energy that already exists. Milton Keynes has a spirit of innovation, which was vibrant in the 1960s and 70s.We have to maintain that same level of enthusiasm and commitment.\" Walter Bor was one of the original planners of Milton Keynes. He recalls his involvement in designing the master plan. \"We said in our submission we would try to plan a city which matures towards the end of the cen tury,\" he says. \"We therefore had to visualise a society, what its aspirations and needs would be.\" Back then, today's car culture was in its infancy and one explicit request by the now defunct Milton Keynes development corporation was to make the place congestion free. Hence the North American-styled, tree-lined boulevards. It is possible to drive from one side of the city to the other in about 15 minutes. The only trouble is that to the uninitiated, all the roads look the same. But as most residents will say, a key enjoyment to living in the city is the ability to drive wherever they like. Consequently, the local bus service is not a sophisticated network. Milton Keynes' dependency on cars is one of Bor's regrets. Jones agrees. \"There is no incentive for people to get out of their cars and walk,\" he says. \"Parking is only a few steps from the shops, just like the malls in suburban American towns. And to get from one side of the road to the other, they have to cross wide boulevards, two rows of parking, a dual carriageway and then more parking. \"Everything here is quite low density. What we want is a high-density city centre. Building retail developments on the car parking areas and transferring parking to the edges of town will achieve this. And turning the boulevards into streets will make the place more personal and intimate.\" Essentially, to compete alongside the big boys, like London, Birmingham and Manchester, Milton Keynes must become a softer, more vibrant place. As Scott-Garrett says: \"People want more out of their cities today. Businesses locating to a place expect an exciting, energetic and diverse place for their staff to live and work. And when there is a choice of places offering a whole range of cultural attractions, Milton Keynes must be up there among them.\" My kind of town To give residents the opportunity to voice their opinions on the future shape of their city centre, Milton Keynes city council set up a dedicated web page with a live chat room. It stayed open for two months, and these are some of the views aired on the site: \"When you walk between the different facilities in the centre of Milton Keynes, you're forced to traipse through miles of car parks. Let's get rid of the cars in the centre and build multi-storeys on the outskirts, or improve park-and-ride. Then we'll have a city centre you can actually walk around.\" Sue Baker \"One of the problems with Milton Keynes is that it is such a young city in terms of its resident popu lation. There is not much in the city centre for people over the age of 30 to do. The theatre is great, but all the bars are 'trendy' chains appealing more to the younger age group. The centre needs some variety in what it offers.\" Elaine \"Yes, some comedy and jazz clubs, etc, would be nice. Maybe a casino too.\" Old(ish) Bloke \"I would like to see more small shops. I love the market in MK, but a long row of small, specialised shops would give entrepreneurs a great opportunity and the city would gain much more character.\" Scorpio \"MK is one of the most boring places to possibly be. I am 16, and have lived here all my life. More needs to be done to make free activities centres for youngsters. Everything at the moment is just money, money, money.\" Marc Yerrell \"There is no clearly defined town centre. What centre there is, is nearly a mile from the railway station. This discourages pedestrians and encourages car use.\" Martin \"The centre could benefit from more small parks around the offices and shops: somewhere for people to meet up and eat their lunch in the sunshine.\" Anonymous \"MK is pretty good . . . but it can seem a little clinical, with everything laid out like an architect's model. A little human clutter and colour would be very welcome.\" James Mayfield"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
