The new leader visited the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly to give \u201cthe troops\u201d \u2013 as his spokeswoman called them \u2013 a pep talk. Of the 428 people chosen to stand as candidates for Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique En Marche (Republic on the Move, or La REM) party for next month\u2019s parliamentary elections, 52% are new to politics and have never held elected office. They were being given a crash course on how to run an election campaign, organise and motivate a team and deal with the press at a seminar to which journalists were not invited. Macron was driven straight past waiting cameras and journalists anxious to question him on his falling-out with the veteran centrist Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou over candidate selection for the coming poll. Macron, who needs a parliamentary majority to push through his programme of reforms, has promised to field candidates in all but one of France\u2019s 577 constituencies; the exception is Manuel Valls\u2019s constituency, where La REM is not putting anyone up against the former Socialist prime minister. On Sunday morning, Macron will mount the steps of the Elys\u00e9e Palace, see his predecessor Fran\u00e7ois Hollande off the premises and begin his daunting task. The path to the presidential palace began 13 months ago in Macron\u2019s home town of Amiens in northern France when he launched En Marche!, as his party was originally called, billed as neither right nor left but \u201ctranspartisan\u201d. Macron, in an open-necked shirt, addressed a handpicked audience. He admitted it was a \u201cradical\u201d idea and frankly \u201ca bit mad\u201d. Socialists and rightwingers lined up to agree. At the time, Valls described it as \u201cabsurd\u201d, others said it was \u201cidiotic\u201d. Political analysts predicted he was just angling for a safe parliamentary seat; \u201che\u2019s a man in a hurry\u201d, said radio commentator Alain Duhamel. Others mocked: \u201cEn Marche! But where\u2019s he going?\u201d Nobody gave much serious thought to him becoming president this time around. Most French leaders \u2013 the majority of them, like Macron, graduates of the \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Administration, the elite hothouse for the country\u2019s political class \u2013 reach the pinnacle and pull up the ladder. Macron, who promised to refresh France\u2019s political scene with new blood and new faces, has lowered it and invited motivated members of the public to join him in power. His first task on Monday will be to name a prime minister \u2013 the identity of whom, despite frenzied speculation, is still a mystery. The PM will then appoint ministers. If Macron fails to obtain an outright majority in the parliamentary elections on 11 and 18 June, he will almost certainly have to replace some of his first choices. Without a convincing majority \u2013 or, worse, faced with a hostile opposition majority \u2013 Macron will be unlikely to fulfil his election pledges, particularly the more controversial ones. He has pledged to lower corporation tax, reorganise the pension system, make labour laws more flexible, slash public spending and shrink the civil service by 120,000 posts. Less than a week after his election, there is an atmosphere of barely contained chaos in the La REM camp. The row with Bayrou has already struck a jarring note. The veteran centrist was one of the first leading politicians to rally to Macron, setting his own presidential ambitions aside. \u201cWe got him elected,\u201d Bayrou told journalists last week. Bayrou claimed that his MoDem party has not been allotted enough winnable parliamentary seats. The president-elect was, he said, effectively operating a \u201crecycling operation\u201d involving the Socialist party. On Friday evening, after hasty talks, Bayrou announced that a \u201csolid and balanced\u201d agreement had been struck, but Macron made no comment. Christophe Castaner, one of Macron\u2019s close advisers, told journalists \u201ceverything is fine\u201d between the two but insisted there would be no electoral deals or candidates imposed on La REM. Macron has to find another 148 candidates before the end of the week. The argument has been greeted with schadenfreude from the conservative Les R\u00e9publicains who, despite the humiliating failure of their candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon to get past the first-round presidential vote, are regrouping in the hope of forming a parliamentary majority to block Macron. Its members lined up to accuse La REM of amateurism. Introducing La REM\u2019s wannabe MPs Richard Ferrand, the party\u2019s general secretary, said the aim was to \u201cbuild a majority of change\u201d. There were five criteria, he added: \u201cRenewal, gender equality, probity, pluralism and coherence. \u201cNever before has a French political movement that has only been in existence for 13 months had the audacity to present 52% of candidates who are people with no professional political CV or any political history,\u201d Ferrand told journalists last week. The first published list, which includes company bosses and shop owners, doctors and nurses, lawyers and judges, teachers, professors, farmers, a wine maker, two fire officers and a former bullfighter, contained at least half a dozen errors, and had to be hastily corrected. Ferrand insisted that the 148 vacancies would be filled before Friday\u2019s registration deadline and hoped they would lead to a \u201crecomposition of the political landscape\u201d. That message was intended for the ears of Les R\u00e9publicains: for La REM to claim to be \u201cnot right nor left\u201d, as Macron insists, it needs some heavyweights from the right who are \u201cMacron-friendly\u201d. Pascal Perrineau, head of the Sciences Po university\u2019s political research institute, Cevipof, says the challenge facing Macron\u2019s untried and inexperienced army should not be understated. France likes its politicians well-seasoned, he said, and while the idea of the \u201csympathetic amateur\u201d was charming, Macron would need to find some professionals \u201cto reassure the electorate\u201d. \u201cThis is when things get hard,\u201d Perrineau said. \u201cWe have a saying in France: he has eaten his white bread first; now he will have to eat his black bread. It will not be easy.\u201d If, against all odds and predictions, Macron succeeds, he will have journeyed from Amiens to the Elys\u00e9e in just 13 months, creating in the process a political party that can drum up more than 500 potential MPs. By any standards it will be an extraordinary and historic political feat. There remains an awful lot to do, but as Macron liked to say during his presidential campaign: \u201cOnly those who try have problems.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
