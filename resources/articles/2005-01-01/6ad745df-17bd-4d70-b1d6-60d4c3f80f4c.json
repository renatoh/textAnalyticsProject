If its first 11 days are anything to go by, 2005 looks set to be the Year of the Sulk. Until the departure of Germaine Greer, Channel 4's Celebrity Big Brother had been marked only by the unedifying sight of an obese old mute racing tipster, skulking around the house in big pants and a deerstalker, refusing to say a peep after being denied his favourite sugar-free fizzy drink. It's just a shame John McCririck isn't in tip-top shape - otherwise advertising execs would soon be snapping him up to be the next Diet Coke man. 2. The whole country was on its way to being Big Brothered by the time David Blunkett resigned in a bit of a sulk at the end of last year, but it's Gordon Brown who has taken up his mantle in 2005. Tony Blair's refusal to make way for his chancellor reportedly led to his next door neighbour telling him: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me that I could ever believe\" (\"So don't even bother talking to me any more\" are presumably the unsaid following words). Mind you, it's not the first time Mr Brown's been accused of having a bit of a sulk. Even Michael Howard was at it, in his 2003 speech to the Conservative party conference, where he accused the chancellor of turning from the \"Incredible Hulk to the Incredible Sulk in two days flat\". 3. Gordon Brown would, however, have to carry on for some time yet to beat the \"longest sulk in political history\". That record is, of course, held by Ted Heath, whose almighty strop at being replaced as Tory leader by Margaret Thatcher only abated slightly some 15 years later when Maggie finally got knifed in the back and tearfully departed Number 10. 4. But sulking's been around for as long as we have - just have a look at Genesis. You can't imagine that Adam didn't go and sit under that apple tree and refuse to speak to Eve for a while, once he'd confessed to God that: \"The woman you put here with me - she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.\" And as for their sons - what's this if not a sulk? \"The Lord looked with favour on Abel and his offering, but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favour. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.\" 5. The Greeks were at it too. Homer's entire 24-book epic The Iliad is based on Achilles throwing a strop when Agamemnon goes off with a girl he'd already picked out as a war prize for himself. He goes off to sulk in his tent before causing decades of havoc. 6. Proving it's not only men who harp on about lost opportunities in literary masterpieces, Miss Havisham pops up in Dickens' Great Expectations, sitting around moping in her wedding dress and - god forbid - not even doing the dusting after being ditched at the altar. 7. But reverting to type, Emily Bronte's Heathcliff shows how beastly a sulky scorned man can be - though Kate Bush appears to have done all right out of him. 8. The world of sport has always had its share of sulkers. Superbrat may have been the tabloids' favourite nickname for John McEnroe, but his other monikers included the Merchant of Menace, King Sneer, and (who'd have guessed Michael Howard didn't think up the name himself?) the Incredible Sulk. 9. But the reigning monarch of sporting sulk is Nicolas Anelka, currently refusing to play for Manchester City against his old team Arsenal and waiting (again) for a \"big team\" to come and rescue him from his plight. As this article puts it, the French striker is currently starring in Return of the Sulk (Partie Cinq). 10. Finally, don't go thinking we humans are the only ones capable of the odd sulk. Take a look at Eeyore - AA Milne's donkey wrote a whole Little Book of Gloom. And just remember: \"You can give the donkey a happy ending ... but the miserable beginning remains forever.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
