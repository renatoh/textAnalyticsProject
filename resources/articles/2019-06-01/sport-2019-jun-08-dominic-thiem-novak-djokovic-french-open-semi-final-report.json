After all, Djokovic had won the past three grand slam events and was bidding to hold all four majors for the second time in his career. The reality is that the job is half-done and unfortunately for Thiem, the second half may be the toughest. On Sunday he will play Rafael Nadal, the 11-times champion, who will have been happier than anyone to see Thiem and Djokovic go the distance in the second semi-final, which had already been held over from the previous night. Beating the world\u2019s top two, back to back, would be a massive achievement; doing it with a day\u2019s less rest would seem nigh impossible. And yet, there is always a chance. \u201cTo play Rafa here on this court is always the ultimate challenge, one of the toughest challenges [in] sports in general,\u201d Thiem said after his 6-2, 3-6, 7-5, 5-7, 7-5 win over Djokovic. \u201cI played a really good match against him in Barcelona [when he won]. It was six weeks ago. So I try to do similar even though it\u2019s way tougher to play him here. \u201cBut I try to keep all the positive emotions I\u2019m having from this amazing match today and go with a really positive mind into the match tomorrow, and then we\u2019ll see. It\u2019s an unbelievable opportunity. \u201cI said last year that I hope to get another chance in a grand slam final and hope to do better then, so tomorrow there is the chance.\u201d Thiem\u2019s resilience meant he came out on top in a topsy-turvy and dramatic encounter on Court Philippe Chatrier. He eventually won in four hours and 13 minutes in a match played over two days, initially in viciously windy conditions and on Saturday in still blustery weather. Leading 3-1 in the third set overnight, Thiem moved ahead, but Djokovic levelled and when the world No 1 saved two match points at 3-5 before getting back to 5-5, he looked the likelier winner. But ultimately it was Thiem who held his nerve to set up a rematch of last year\u2019s final. A year after he was well beaten in his first slam final, there is now a feeling that Thiem is a changed man, more confident and more assured. His coaching switch, from G\u00fcnter Bresnik to Nicol\u00e1s Mass\u00fa, has brought a certain freedom to his game and to his mindset. Nadal, who beat Roger Federer in straight sets on Friday to reach his 12th French Open final, looks in ominous form. After a slow start to the clay court season, his victory in Rome, where he beat Djokovic in the final, gave him a massive boost and though Thiem has beaten him four times on clay, he will surely be relieved to see the Austrian and not the World No 1 across the net. For Thiem, those wins on clay, particularly the most recent one in Barcelona, may just give him the belief that even the near-impossible \u2013 beating Nadal in a Roland Garros final \u2013 is possible. Few will give him much of a chance, which may just be a nice position for him to be in. \u201cI had some very good matches in the past against him on clay and I also beat him on clay already [this year],\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that I go into the match with the belief to win. That\u2019s the most important thing. \u201cIt\u2019s a big dream for me to win that match, to win this title. But I also have in my head that [it may] not happen tomorrow, which can happen easy because of the opponent [who] is on the other side of the net, so I don\u2019t make myself [under] too much pressure.\u201d Mass\u00fa had hoped the final might be delayed until Monday to be fair to both players but said of Thiem: \u201cHe will try to play his game, try to play his own tennis. And I will talk to him. We will talk about his tactical plan, his technical plan, but we know it\u2019s difficult. He\u2019ll do his best possible and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
