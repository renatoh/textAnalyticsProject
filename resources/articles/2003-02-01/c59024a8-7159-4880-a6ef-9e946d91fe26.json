Maybe Yazmin Reza, author of the play Art, was thinking of him when she had friends fall out over a white monochrome (the audience being expected to see the painting as a metricious banality). I am in the position of the man who buys the painting in that lousy play: I love Ryman's paintings, but trying to explain why is likely to make me sound a fool. The catalogue essay for this exhibition compares him to Monet, Bonnard and C\u00e9zanne, but they are unilluminating comparisons if only because they get us away from the main issue: Ryman's Americanness. He is a classic American amateur, and amateurism is one of the most important, least observed strengths of American modern art. His paintings have something wonderfully handicraft-like about them. The texture of the network of slapdash yet considered brushing has the ruggedness of decorative plasterwork. A sceptic might say his paintings look like unfinished DIY, and that is their charm. What a critic is supposed to say is that Ryman's paintings are subtler and richer than you expect, that you can see landscapes, stories and personality in them, that each one is different. Rubbish. They are indeed all different, but in a more significant way they are all the same. There is a method, a truth that each variation proclaims, as puritan as a white clapboard church - and as American. White is the colour of Hermann Melville's whale (and Melville has a whole chapter on the horror of whiteness); of the glint on death's nose in John Singleton Copley's Watson and the Shark; and of the stars and stripes in Jasper Johns's White Flag. In The Sopranos, Anthony Jnr gets help understanding Robert Frost from his older sister Meadow. \"But I thought black meant death,\" he complains when she explains that snow signifies mortality. \"White, too,\" replies Meadow. I do not think anyone could mistake these for anything but American paintings, as white as the bones of the last prairie buffalo. \u00b7 Until March 1. Details: 020-7495 5050."}, "isHosted": false}}}
