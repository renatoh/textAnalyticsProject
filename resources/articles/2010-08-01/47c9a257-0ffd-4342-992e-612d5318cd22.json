He was ambushed over the government's cancelled plans to do a retro spot of milk-snatching and misreported in his equally cautious remarks about university funding. Contrary to some reports yesterday the phrase \"graduate tax\" did not cross Willetts's lips. It did not cross those of his coalition boss, the equally cerebral Dr Vince Cable, when the business secretary floated some challenging thoughts on the future of higher education which alarmed (\"much of what we have to say you might not like\") assorted vested interests a month ago. But the media likes to scare its readers, students and their parents, with simple talk of an open-ended graduate tax. As the University and College Union (UCU), Britain's biggest academic lobby, pointed out it would cost teachers and nurses a lot more over a working life, doctors and their like much more still: \u00a377,000 on UCU's assumption that it would be levied at 5p in the \u00a3. None of which is likely to happen. It is all part of routine manoeuvres ahead of the Labour-initiated, Tory-endorsed review being conducted by Lord Browne who got out of BP before the Gulf gusher. His high-powered team is charged with re-examining fees and financial support for full- and (often neglected) part-time students, including post-grads. Whatever they conclude by their October deadline \u2013 and ministers have no inkling so far \u2013 it is unlikely to be the kind of graduate tax endorsed by the National Union of Students and assorted Labour leadership contenders, two vested interests whose views should definitely be ignored, wiser heads agree. One persistent problem bedevilling the issue is language. \"Top-up fees\" and \"tuition fees\" are as unhelpful as \"graduate tax\". Cable and Willetts talk of a \"graduate contribution\" \u2013 which Cable passionately believes should be fairer than the current system of loans repayable via the income tax system after a graduate's earnings pass \u00a315,000 a year, albeit at a nil rate of real interest. That income-contingent formula handsomely subsidises the better off, those who read economics or who can spot a bargain. Busy warning universities of tough times ahead, ministers need to find cuts fast to placate George Osborne. Cut research science? Or apprenticeships? No thanks. They need Browne to extract more money from graduates and quickly. But a pure graduate tax does not do that quickly enough. It would exclude those who do not pay UK income tax or chose to graduate abroad. There would have to be cut-offs and exemptions, as Browne's researchers are discovering. Worse for universities it would again centralise funding, making them more dependent on Treasury goodwill, not less as Blair-Brown intended in creating annual fees, one of their more important public sector reforms, vital to maintaining the triple-A status of this key British export industry. Browne is all but certain to propose lifting the fee cap, currently \u00a33,250, unpopular but necessary if Oxbridge is to charge more than Bogstandard Uni. Among the evidence submitted to Browne, proposals from the University Alliance, the group of mostly ex-poly access universities, envisages a graduate contribution scheme (GSC). It would simplify the system, cap graduates' lifetime liabilities, and charge the full cost of loans (not the same as a commercial rate) which would be raised and paid upfront from the private sector. The poorest would be protected, the link with one's university maintained. Labels like GSC sound unglamorous, its details complicated. Some theoreticians even envisage a supplementary/alternative \"equity contract\" whereby students commit to pay their alma mater a percentage of lifetime earnings. And as governments are now poor too Browne could usefully seek to generate more money from two other key sources: private donors and industry. That might create a different set of dilemmas, not least the \"donor preference\" concept which keeps Harvard wealthy and global No 1. Alumni pay up and Harvard looks favourably on its kids. Would that offend Cable's idea of fairness?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
