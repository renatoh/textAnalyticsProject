The manager tasted defeat for the first time in the Premier League and the only comfort to him may have been that the scoreline flattered his team. \u201cI saw a lot of problems because we played very badly from a physical point of view; mentally, technically and tactically \u2013 particularly in the first 20 minutes,\u201d Sarri said. \u201cI knew very well we had a lot of problems to solve and today it was clear for everybody [to see]. \u201cI hope first of all for the players because I told them in the last week that we had a big problem with our approach to the start of matches and today was the same approach. The level of build-up was different and, after 15 minutes, we were 2-0 down.\u201d Mauricio Pochettino, the Spurs manager, could be delighted with every aspect of the game \u2013 apart from, possibly, a bit of wasteful finishing \u2013 but he chose to highlight the attitude of his players which, he said, had not always been on point this season. \u201cToday confirms that it\u2019s not about the names on the pitch \u2013 it\u2019s about the right attitude,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cOne thing we need to realise is that with the right attitude, we can compete at this level. The problem is when we struggle to show our real quality because we show a lack of aggressivity, will and attitude.\u201d For Sarri, there was only woe and he said he could have substituted all 11 of his players. He added: \u201cThe defensive phase today was a disaster. I am not talking about the defensive line but the [whole] defensive phase. The offensive players pressed very badly, the midfielders defended not very well and the defensive line, as a consequence, was a disaster. The defensive phase of the team was a disaster. \u201cIn the first 25 or 30 minutes, we had big problems to exit from our half. We lost a lot of balls and, against Tottenham, it is very dangerous to lose a lot of balls in your half. In the short counter-attack, they are probably the best in Europe.\u201d Eden Hazard was denied a penalty on 14 minutes, after a challenge from Juan Foyth, which might have levelled it up at 1-1 but Sarri refused to look for excuses. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would have made a difference because for 90 minutes, there was a difference,\u201d Sarri said. \u201cI have to study the 90 minutes, not only one action. It looked like a penalty but I have to say Tottenham won well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
