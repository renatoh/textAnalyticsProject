Labour has promised to deliver more open government but the party's peers were the worst offenders for keeping secret their donations - 65 of 108 either refused or failed to respond to a Guardian survey about party funding by members of the House of Lords. Of the total of 250 life peers asked to complete the recent questionnaire, 92 failed to respond while a further 34 said they did not want to take part; 72 of the peers who did answer said they had given money to a political party and 51 said they had not donated. Across the parties, 55% of Conservatives, 45% of crossbenchers, and 22% of Lib Dem peers, failed to respond to the survey. The results are at odds with a recent report by the committee on standards in public life which said the Lords, as a vital institution in public life and one in which the public and the media were likely to show a growing interest, should adopt greater transparency. The amounts given by the 29 Labour peers who said they had donated ranged from \u00a35 a month by standing order given by Lord Smith of Gilmorehill, to the \u00a32m from Lord Sainsbury, who also promised a further \u00a32m for the election campaign. However, a spokesman for the science minister said that Lord Sainsbury would not reveal how much money he had given in the past. \"Since David became a minister he has declared exactly how much money he has given. Before that he was a private individual and sees no reason to say how much money, or when, he has given to a political party,\" the spokesman said. A number of Labour peers replied that they had refused to respond after taking advice from the Labour whips' office in the Lords. A spokeswoman for Lady Jay, the leader of the Lords, said the government had advised ministers and peers not to respond. \"It is not that they cannot respond, they are advised centrally not to do it,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It is standard practice for all government ministers. Newspapers often use surveys and the standard advice is not to respond. As far as Labour peers go, if they ask for advice - and it is only advice, they can do whatever they want - we would advise them not to take part, as they have no control of the information and can never be sure how it will be used.\" Of the peers who did respond only nine said they had given more than \u00a35,000 to a political party. Lord Bragg, the broadcaster who became a Labour peer in 1998, said he had made two donations of \u00a37,500 in 1997 and a further \u00a37,500 donation in 1999. Lord Paul, the industrialist who joined the Lords in 1996, said that he had given between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000 to Labour every year during the past nine years. The Conservative party treasurer, Lord Ashcroft, who gave \u00a33m in November 1999, responded by saying: \"I appreciate that your letter was something of a standard communication, but I nevertheless enjoyed the novelty of being asked whether I had ever donated money to a political party ... my contributions are disclosed in considerable detail [in the party accounts]. \"I sometimes think it is ironic that I'm criticised for the alleged secrecy of my donations, when in reality I am perhaps the most transparent donor of all.\" The largest Liberal Democrat donor who responded to the survey was the banker Lord Sandberg, who said he and his wife had donated \u00a31,000 a year during the past three years. The most interesting response came from Lord Bell, formerly Lady Thatcher's PR guru, who said: \"When I worked for Thatcher she used to ask whether you would like love or money. If you said love you got a title and if you said money you got paid.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
