The operation was done to provoke tensions between western countries. It was persistent, sophisticated and well-resourced, and involved fake accounts on more than 30 platforms and nine languages, over five years, the study says. In May, Facebook took down a small number of \u201cinauthentic\u201d accounts which it said \u201coriginated in Russia\u201d. The accounts\u2019 behaviour \u201cwas consistent with an operation run by an intelligence service\u201d, the study carried out by the Atlantic Council\u2019s digital research lab found. The most sensational piece of Russian fake news said that \u201cradical opponents of Brexit\u201d were planning to assassinate Johnson. A forged letter warning of the plot was posted on a mocked-up Facebook page that appeared to belong to a senior Spanish official. The letter, complete with official seal, was signed by Spain\u2019s foreign minister \u201cJosep Borrell Fontenelles\u201d. The minister\u2019s name was spelled incorrectly. User accounts were created to share the Johnson story in Spanish and English media, and then deleted later the same day. A meme with Johnson shrugging his shoulders above the words \u201cguess I\u2019ll die\u201d was then spread via a Facebook group created in Russia. Another 2018 fake featured a tweet designed to look like the account of the then UK defence secretary Gavin Williamson. Posted in March, it claimed the Real IRA delivered a \u201ccomponent of the nerve agent\u201d used to poison Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. Beneath it was a photo of police officers in hazmat suits. A fake user \u2013 \u201cEdward McGrew\u201d \u2013 then posted the tweet in an article. It claimed that Williamson had deleted the novichok tweet within minutes because the information was \u201csensitive and classified\u201d. The \u201cMcGrew\u201d account used a photo of the actor Hugh Laurie. The fake articles circulated on what the study calls the \u201csoft underbelly of the internet\u201d. They appeared on Medium, Reddit, the German website homment.com, San Francisco-based site indybay.org, Spain\u2019s globedia.com, and other sites. The stories got little attention. \u201cIn terms of effort this was huge. In terms of bang for your buck I have never seen so little bang for buck,\u201d Ben Nimmo of the Atlantic Council said. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre.\u201d Nimmo said that this appeared to be the work of an intelligence agency, rather than the notorious \u201ctroll factory\u201d based in St Petersburg that interfered in the 2016 American presidential election. The most likely culprit was the GRU, the Russian military intelligence outfit. The GRU hacked and leaked Democratic Party emails, special counsel Robert Mueller said. \u201cIt\u2019s guys whose job is secrecy trying to do social media. They were trying so hard to hide their identities they effectively hid their content as well,\u201d Nimmo said. The operation was a classic influence campaign, known as \u201cactive measures\u201d. One high-profile victim of the Russian operation was the Republican senator Marco Rubio. A photoshopped \u201ctweet\u201d from Rubio claimed that Britain\u2019s GCHQ, which \u201cspied\u201d on Donald Trump in 2016, was \u201cback in the game\u201d. The agency was now using deep fakes to support the Democrats in the US midterm elections. \u201cNo-one \u2013 especially our closest ally \u2013 has the right to threaten our democracy &amp; national security,\u201d the fake August 2018 tweet said. It was coupled with a picture of the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants. The \u201ctweet\u201d was picked up by the state media channel RT, formerly known as Russia Today. It was unclear if RT was aware the content was fake. Moscow\u2019s aim is to inflame tensions between the US and UK, as part of a \u201cdivide and conquer strategy\u201d, the study concludes. Trump has claimed on Twitter that he is the victim of a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot carried out by his own spy agencies, with GCHQ\u2019s assistance. GCHQ has described this as ridiculous. In a genuine tweet last week, Rubio called out Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d, and said that Moscow would carry on churning out \u201crealistic looking\u201d fakes. The Russians pretended to be an unnamed senior Labour party figure at Westminster. They created a fake Facebook page, using the person\u2019s genuine photo and bio, and shared real articles from the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn. Two similar fake Facebook parliament-linked pages were set up \u2013 one in the UK, and another in Spain. It was unclear if the goal was to plant false stories only \u2013 or if Facebook was being used to attract genuine followers who might then be entrapped or recruited, the study says. A particularly vicious fake claimed that migrants in Germany were plotting to molest German women. It was spread via a now suspended Twitter account \u2013 @KPrydius \u2013 supposedly belonging to a Ukrainian woman, Katja Prydius, living in Germany. Her tweets achieved \u201csignificant pick-up\u201d and still circulate on German far-right websites, the study says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
