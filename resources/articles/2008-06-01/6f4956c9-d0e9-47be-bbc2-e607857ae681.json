Behind their jokey references and diverse cultural allusions lurks beautifully crafted music of great energy and creative imagination. London-born Cutler, 40 this year and currently head of composition at Birmingham Conservatoire, seems to have bypassed the mainstream of contemporary British music, studying at the Chopin Conservatoire in Warsaw and then working extensively in the Netherlands. It has given Cutler's music a tang all its own, and the stylistic freedom to incorporate whatever seems appropriate and integrate it comfortably into his language. So the solo piano piece Buckley's Hot Licks begins with keyboard pyrotechnics, veers into melodrama in its central section with the pianist as reciter, before ending with a homage to Art Tatum-style stride piano, while Sal's Sax is a hard-edged essay in Dutch minimalism driven along on a tide of brass and explosive keyboard and percussion chords. The beautiful Music for Cello and Strings from 2005 seems to me the most impressive work here, referencing a range of 20th-century models, from Schoenberg to Takemitsu, yet remaining confidently itself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
