Sandwiched between last year's World Cup and next year's European Championship, there is a little room for the other sports to stretch and scratch. Tennis, cricket, rugby, athletics and the rest should be smiling into their morning tea rubbing their hands in anticipation - but so far, and sometimes through no fault of their own, it hasn't quite worked out that way. After Ashes and World Cup disaster, and Andrew Flintoff's best efforts on a pedalo, England have demolished West Indies but that has been overshadowed by West Indies' freefall into oblivion. Kevin Pietersen's brilliance, extending to a maiden double century last week at Headingley, has just not captured the nation's attention as it did two years ago. And the seemingly interminable sagas of Michael Vaughan's knee and Flintoff's ankle have hardly added sparkle to the late spring. Meanwhile rugby union is having a bit of a shocker. Excitement was supposed be mounting by now as England prepare to defend their World Cup in France in September. But it took masochism to watch the ill-conceived Tests in South Africa, let alone play in them, and it has been similar for Wales in Australia and Ireland in Argentina. At least it is all over for now, apart from St Helens winning a lot more games in Super League. As Britain's athletes struggled through the storms in Glasgow last weekend, it was hard to be enthused about their World Championships either. National treasures and potential national treasures seem to spend their time squabbling about whether the golden years really were the golden years, with the exception of Sebastian Coe and Denise Lewis, who on Monday had to look smitten with the vomited jigsaw unveiled as the 2012 logo. And then there is tennis. June is Wimbledon, but British players are not having the best time with Andy Murray injured, Greg Rusedski retired and Tim Henman out in the first round of the French Open as he slips down the rankings like a man on a runaway bobsleigh. Only Lewis Hamilton and his high...#8209;tech car and Frankie Dettori on his beautiful double Derby horses have kept football off the back page. There was Ryan Giggs enjoying a well-deserved farewell flourish for Wales. And there was Joey Barton, on the brink of a less well deserved big-money move to Big Sam's Newcastle. The FA Cup final, the Champions League final, the play-off finals, even the FA Trophy final was hot news because it was played at the all-singing all-dancing new Wembley. And every day some mysterious businessman or politician with a dodgy past seems to be wafting their wallet in the direction of another Premiership club. And then there is that tattooed pretty boy with his bouncebackability. He was supposed to be taking his hairstyles, his profile and his right foot over the Atlantic forever. Instead he's back for England in yet another crucial match, against Estonia, where a good free-kick might secure that knighthood whatever the objections of the MCC members in Whitehall. With Victoria dabbling with yet another diet plan and doing away with her bra, though presumably not burning it, the Beckhams' takeover of even the non-Big Brother newspapers has been almost complete. It is not always the way. Only two years ago the Ashes made cricket the new football, and the old football briefly unloved even in September. And in 2001, Henman Hill became the most popular destination in the country as our Tim got to within a racket string of the Wimbledon final. But all is not lost for those of us who secretly pine for a football-free summer. Roger Federer's feline crawl to another Wimbledon title is not long away. The Indians are coming soon and bringing with them Sachin Tendulkar and fanatical crowds. And the steely way that Vaughan blamed Flintoff for England's World Cup disaster yesterday hints at some interesting dressing-room realpolitik when Freddie returns. And, for those who enjoy its gentle rhythms, the County Championship offers up a treat. Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne are looking at the rising mercury and winding up their wrists to work through batsmen. And there is the prospect of Darren Gough winning the title with Yorkshire. It would be the first time a ballroom dancer who has sported spandex on live television has lifted the championship trophy. And he's from Barnsley.
