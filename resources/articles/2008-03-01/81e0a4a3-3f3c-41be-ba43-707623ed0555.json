Living in Nairobi, they can witness first hand whether a government's rhetoric about public spending is matched by an improvement in the roads, or whether slums really are being given the running water and electricity they were promised. So when President Kibaki prematurely declared himself the winner at the last general election, the response was swift and brutal. Britain said clearly that the international community would not accept the results. The African Union also stepped in, and Kofi Annan jetted in to bang heads together and hammer out a compromise. Compare this with other dodgy elections. Ethiopia held a fudged election in 2005, with vote rigging, riots, police brutality and the arrest of several key members of the opposition. The west withheld some aid, but prime minister Meles Zenawi and his party held on to power and much of the opposition is still in jail. In Uganda too, President Museveni changed the constitution so he could run for a third term, stuffed some ballot boxes and tear-gassed opponents who tried to protest. He is still there, and Uganda is considered a model of development and progress. Zimbabwe is a different case. International criticism of Robert Mugabe has become deafening, but has been infuriatingly ineffectual, and Mugabe wears the condemnation of the west as a badge of honour. Zimbabweans are bracing themselves for tomorrow's elections. There is little doubt that the vote will be fixed and anyway the results are already skewed by the gerrymandering and harassment of opposition politicians that has taken place. The main uncertainty is what will happen next. Members of the opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change, have already in their despair started to speak about protesting, the way the opposition protested in Kenya, to bring about change, but this is a dangerous strategy. Mugabe has warned his countrymen that he has enough security forces to clamp down on any protests - it's a thinly-veiled threat of violence against civilians in opposition areas that can only make life for Zimbabweans even harder. The Kenyan newspaper The Nation ran a piece this week expressing astonishment at the fact that Kenya's post-election violence and subsequent coalition government may be seen as a model of how to bring about change in Zimbabwe. Most Kenyans still feel that the deaths of 1,200 people and the loss of 350,000 homes is too high a price to have paid for their coalition. They are also still dealing with the fallout from the ethnic rivalries and old hatred that flared up during the violence. But could Zimbabwe benefit from the sustained and patient international intervention that eventually led to an end to the violence in Kenya? Britain and America simply cannot exert the same direct influence on Zimbabwe as they did on Kenya, but they can help the African Union and Zimbabwe's neighbours talk the country away from bloodshed and dictatorship."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
