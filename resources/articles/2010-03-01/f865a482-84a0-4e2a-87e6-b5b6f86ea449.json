In particular he enthused over the novices Long Run and Punchestowns, calling them \"as good as any chaser I've ever had\". The pair are poised to race against each other for the first time in the RSA Chase over three miles on the Festival's second day and the trainer hopes that one or both will show enough ability to merit consideration for a future running of the Cheltenham Gold Cup, in which he will not have a runner this year. \"They are both hugely talented,\" Henderson said. \"We've got some proper novice hurdlers and novice chasers who can hopefully come through. I'm the only thing that's getting older around here.\" Punchestowns could take his chance in next year's Gold Cup, when he will be eight, but that may be too soon for Long Run, who is two years younger and was described as having \"freakish\" ability. Indeed, Long Run may yet be switched to the two-mile Arkle Trophy if Cheltenham's going is \"bottomless\". In the meantime the focus is on teaching him to jump fences that are very different from those he encountered in his native France. The trainer says he will be given \"English lessons\" in a schooling session tomorrow, when the expert Yogi Breisner will also work on the hurdling technique of General Miller, who is being aimed at the Supreme Novice Hurdle. Henderson has trained more Festival winners, 34, than any other trainer still holding a licence and is within six of the record, held by Fulke Walwyn, who died in 1991. He claims to have no particular designs on surpassing that mark, though it would presumably give him great pleasure, not least because he worked as assistant to Fred Winter, Walwyn's great rival and neighbour, in the 1970s. He denied a report that his principal jockey, Barry Geraghty, had already chosen to ride Punjabi, rather than Zaynar, in the Champion Hurdle but indicated that that was the outcome he expected. Tony McCoy will ride whichever horse Geraghty rejects. At 8-1 Zaynar is two points shorter in the betting than his stablemate, a situation that appears to surprise Henderson. \"Poor old Punjabi. Unless he can retain this title, he will go down as one of the most forgotten Champion Hurdle winners of all time. He is not sexy but he's done very little wrong.\" The trainer also appeared upbeat about the chances of Riverside Theatre in the Arkle Trophy and the Queen's Barbers Shop in the Ryanair Chase."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
