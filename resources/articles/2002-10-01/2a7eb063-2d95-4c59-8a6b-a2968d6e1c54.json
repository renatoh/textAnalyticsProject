But, ah, sweet irony! My beloved city will now be my cage, after that show trial went its tawdry way, our very legal processes rendered corrupt and meaningless after 18 years of Labour government. The 'fantasist' jibes stung particularly hard, as hard as the rain of bullets that day I faced a firing-squad in Mexico. Day Seven: I will keep a diary. It seems but a modest gift to literature, and to Truth; to whom I owe so much of my success. The authorities, corrupted by 40 years of Socialism, hate the idea, of course; they have given me nothing but a pen and a pad of paper. Cunningly, I have managed to extract all the ink from the pen into a saucer and, with the aid of a small twig adroitly secreted about my person, I may now record my thoughts; the paper, when wettened, torn up and placed in a flat position, dries to make papyrus. Thus does genius modestly out. Day Nine: The regime 'inside' is not too poisonous; there is rough humour, but little violence, all as portrayed rather presciently years ago in my novella, Inside! I have decided to be like the other chaps and have even begun to speak their lingo, or 'parvo', as they have it in here. A long-termer is a 'frantywibbet', a cell is an 'apple and spade', and anyone inside for violent assault is a 'mincy' or a 'tutu-twitcher'; we have had many laughs together at my clumsy attempts to catch up, but I feel I am almost wholly accepted by them, and before too long I might have a shower. Day 71: Two visitors! Mary tells me she is being very faithful, and has also just won Miss World and been voted Woman of the Century by readers of Fragrant! magazine. And my new publisher seems a very decent, principled man. Day 75: Vindicated, at last, this happy September day. The reason, it can now be told, why I pretended to lie in court was because MI5 had told me it was utterly vital that I lie to distract attention from a cunning sting operation they had running on some Muslim terrorists. Had I not done so, the 'op' would have failed, leaving the evil fanatics to fly planes into the side of the World Trade Centre and kill thousands, which would have been a tragedy. I smile, but quietly, as I scan the papers, reading all the names of the people I saved. Day 181: I have just been promoted! North Sea Camp is different, but I still miss all the little things that come with Freedom. The cry of geese flying over winter fields; the backstage banter of a theatre, the simple pleasure of a cup of tea in a cafe. I vow I shall one day escape, brilliantly, then write the bestseller Escape! I will make a small glider out of cocktail sticks and the little pieces of paper left when you peel off an Elastoplast. Luckily enough, for the sticks, my friend Gillian is having a little cocktail party! Day 146,080: I have now been in prison for 400 years, which is a world record."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
