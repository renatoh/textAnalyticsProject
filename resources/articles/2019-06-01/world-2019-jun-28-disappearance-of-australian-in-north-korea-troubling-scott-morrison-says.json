Family and friends of Sigley, who has been living and studying in Pyongyang, have not been able to speak to the 29-year-old from Perth since Tuesday, which they say is \u201cunusual\u201d. \u201cHe remains out of digital contact with friends and family, and Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to seek clarification as to his whereabouts and welfare,\u201d the family said in a statement on Friday. Sigley had been studying a master\u2019s degree in Korean literature at Kim Il Sung University and runs a tour company that organises trips for foreign students. Fluent in both Korean and Mandarin, he was an active social media user and his sudden silence has sparked fears about the 29-year-old\u2019s welfare. As Dfat scrambles to understand what may have happened, the former Australian foreign minister Bob Carr told Guardian Australia locating Sigley would require some \u201cdeft diplomacy\u201d. Carr said Australia had to work with \u201cour friends and partners on this case with the objective of getting Alek out of North Korea as soon as possible. \u201cSecondly, we need to send a message to North Korea that we\u2019re very focused on his wellbeing.\u201d On Friday Morrison said he\u2019d been unable to confirm whether Sigley has been detained by the repressive regime. \u201cIt is troubling and concerning to me and I\u2019m sure his family as well,\u201d Morrison told the ABC from the G20 summit in Japan. \u201cThe expressions of support and assistance that have come from other nations I have met with here has been very welcome. \u201cWe will continue to focus sharply on that and seek to clarify what exactly has occurred and then take steps from there.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a statement on Friday Sigley\u2019s family said they had still yet to confirm his whereabouts. \u201cSome media have speculated about the shuttering of Alek\u2019s social media accounts,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThis has been done at the instigation of his family to limit unnecessary speculation and commentary on those channels. \u201cAlek\u2019s family and friends hope to hear from him soon.\u201d While there has been no official confirmation of his disappearance, his wife, Yuka Morinaga, who lives in Tokyo, told the Australian newspaper she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d for her husband\u2019s safety. She said she usually speaks to him on Whatsapp every day but their last contact was on Monday night. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice anything weird,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened. We don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s been detained or not.\u201d \u201cHe is always trying to demystify North Korea, unlike typical Western media. He tries to understand people there.\u201d Another friend, the Australian National University North Korea expert Leonid Petrov, told Guardian Australia he had last spoken to Sigley briefly on Tuesday. \u201cHis Skype is active, I can see the green light, but he doesn\u2019t respond to my messages,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Australia does not have an embassy in North Korea, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) is relying on representations from other countries, including Sweden and the UK, to make representations on their behalf in Pyongyang. Carr said the effectiveness of Australia\u2019s representations on Sigley\u2019s behalf will depend on how well our allies can engage with the North Korean regime. \u201cThey are imponderables, they really are imponderables from this distance. It\u2019s really going to require a bit of deft diplomacy on Dfat\u2019s part,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re relying on using our relationships with countries that in turn have got some relationship with North Korea, and none of us in Australia can really speculate knowingly about which of our partners might be able to deliver the best result and how effective their representations may be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
