The flooding tide aids our passage in the open passenger launch that is fired with shovelfuls of Colombian coal supplemented with chip fat and sawdust. Freighters moored alongside the deep-water loading dock tower above our little craft as they await china clay brought in a line of wagons along the riverside railway track. Three herons peer from treetops downstream of Penpoll Creek, and a crowd of boats are moored off Golant below the hilltop church of St Samson. High tide covers the mudbanks so that the river appears as a lake surrounded by woods. Our skipper steers carefully along a winding course, passing the isolated church of St Winnow, boathouses, old quays, late-cut hay and a wind turbine. Egrets perch in oaks, cormorants dive into the green water, mallards pass overhead and we hear of the recent sighting of an osprey. Reed beds with rush, bullrush and clumps of mauve sea aster encroach on the narrow channel. Leaves float on the murky surface overhung with branches and, after the mainline rail bridge, our boat bumps the bottom as it comes alongside a wharf. Lostwithiel was once a centre for the tin trade. Metal was brought for weighing, stamping and taxing before being shipped downriver to Europe. By the late 16th century the river was so silted with waste from mining upstream that ships could no longer reach here. We must return, quietly and quickly on the ebbing tide. Shadows extend towards sunlit water chopped with yellow and blue reflections as the lowering sun gilds the west-facing tree canopy and burnishes the masses of haws on banks of bracken.
