Who knows? Liverpool go into this tie on the back of only two defeats in their last 16 matches, while Marseille are currently riddled with inconsistency. Sixth in the French league they were beaten 4-1 by Bastia on Sunday. A proper Basting, you might say ... for the most decorated French team in Europe. 1 min: Prior to the match, the Liverpool fans in the Kop end held up cards which spelt out \"Allez! Allez!\". That's French for \"Go! Go!\" And there was me thinking they were behind Houllier. Olympique Marseille kick off playing into the Kop. They're togged out in a less-than-arresting grey strip, and so will probably have the same difficulty seeing each other as Manchester United's players did when they wore the same colour in their infamous reverse at the hands of Southampton. 2 mins: Baros wins possession from a long Chris Kirkland kick-out, hares into the Marseille box and wins a corner. Steven Gerrard delivers, Danny Murphy attacks it and the ball goes out for a goal-kick. 4 mins: \"So why aren't you showing the Celtic match?\" moans Paul O'Sullivan. \"Bugger Liverpool v Marseiile - I can watch that on the TV here in France. How are five million ex-pat Celtic fans supposed to keep up with the match?\" I don't know Paul. Why don't you improvise and overcome? Don't whinge like a big girl's blouse - it's very unbecoming. Build a satellite dish out of twigs and gravel, phone-a-friend, find it on another website. By the way, while you're here I'd be interested to know if you were officially appointed shop steward for five million Celtic fans, or if you just selflessly volunteered for the job out of a sense of duty. 8 mins: Not a lot going on at the match at the moment. Danny Murphy hoists a free-kick into the Marseille box, which Barthez gathers uncontested. For his troubles, he gets roundly booed by the Liverpool fans. That fabled Scouse wit, eh? 10 mins: Steve Marlet misses an absolute sitter. An open goal. Having dinked a little ball over the top for Didier Drogba to run on to, he steered the ball miles wide of a gaping net after it had broken to him from the ensuing collision between his team-mate and Chris Kirkland. Luckily, his blushes are spared - the referee had blown for a free to Liverpool. 16 mins: Corner for Liverpool is floated in deep from the right. Baros gets his head to it, but doesn't make clean contact and the ball ends up way out on the left wing. Baros scurries after it, takes possession and is promptly robbed by a crunching tackle from - I think - Maunel Dos Santos. Ouch! 19 mins: Didier Drogba misses a half-chance for Marseille, failing to control a wayward Marlet delivery properly. 21 mins: Milan Baros, who is running around like a stir-crazy Jack Russell on amphetamines, finds Harry Kewell out on the left wing. Don't get me wrong, it's not as if the Australian was hiding behind an advertising hoarding or anything. Kewell controls the ball, holds it up and then attempts to cross to Owen who is making a darting run into the box. It's a pathetic effort and doesn't even clear the first defender. Olympique Marseille clear. 23 mins: Harry Kewell pulls back a low cross to Michael Owen. Despite being unmarked, he fails to get hold of his shot and from just behind the penalty spot \"shoots\" a feeble low effort straight into Fabien Barthez's arms. You could have punched it harder. 26 mins: In the Liverpool half, Jamie Carragher slides in and relieves Sebastian Perez of possession with an excellent tackle on the touchline. Perez doesn't like it too much though, and the pair get involved in a spot of handbags. The referee gives them both dirty looks but no cards and the match continues. 28 mins: \"More Celtic supporter-baiting please,\" writes Andy Storrar. \"Something about them imminently losing their manager to Liverpool and their best player to Barca should do it.\" No problem Andy. Incidentally, add Maggie Shiels, the bizarrely-monikered Largozag, Eric Smith and Gordon McKenzie to the list of Celtic fans who are moaning about the fact that their tie against Barcelona isn't being covered. I could tell you all how it's going, but I think you need to learn how to fend for yourselves. Tough love and all that. 32 mins: Liverpool win a free-kick not far inside the Marseill half. Harry Kewell wellies it into a crowded penalty area and - here we go - Fabien Barthez rushes out to claim it. Short of clambering over the shoulders of about five players he had no chance of getting it, but luckily for him, a sneaky jostle from Milan Baros wins him a free-kick. 35 mins: Marseille break and only a superb tackle from Jamie Carragher prevents Drogba from getting a low cross into an unmarked Steve Marlet at the far post. 37 mins: \"Yet again you have failed to give us the scene, the vibe, the atmosphere!\" writes Don Evans, who I'm convinced needs to see a shrink. \"Where are you? What wonderful foods do you have at your finger tips?\" Eh, I'm in London and I have half-a-packet of Trebor Extra Strong Mints. Do you feel more involved now, Don?? 38 mins: It's fairly evenly matched so far. Liverpool probably have the upper hand, but Marseille have looked dangerous in spots and are certainly making a mockery of the 6/1 odds that were availble against them winning before kick off. 42 mins: It's been quite some time since anyone's been pedantic and \"witty\" enough to mail in to complain about the fact that our \"minute-by-minute\" coverage isn't actually minute-by-minute. So hats off to you Rajiv Ramchurn in Montreal. I'll have a root around in our bin of goodies to see if I can find a prize to send to you. Let me know what age you are and I'll see if I can find an appropriate colouring book. 45 mins: Liverpool's best move of the game. From middle of the centre-circle, Jamie Carragher picks out Harry Kewell on the left wing. He rifles an excellent cross into the Marseille box, which is inch perfect for the onrushing Michael Owen. Unfortunately, he can't muster enough power and his header doesn't trouble Fabien Barthez. Half-time Very earnest email: \"I know you'll probably have a public go at me but here goes anyway,\" writes the exceedingly perceptive Sound Editing. \"Why the blunt anti-scouse stuff? It's not very sophisticated, is it? With your surname, I'm guessing there's some Irish in you (oo-er), but i don't think the same kind of stuff about stupid Micks would be nearly as acceptable. Anyway, I'm not that pissed off, just trying to elevate the level of public debate - talking of which, they really shouldn't be making the Spaniards play tonight, should they?\" Everyone's entitled to their wrong opinion, Mr Editing. I'd rebut your argument, but unfortunately I'm too busy gnawing on a potato, being oppressed, working on my Cheltenham portfolio, waving my knobbly stick in the air and fancying up my green felt hat in anticipation of a tacky parade and several pints of \"the black stuff\" on Saint Patrick's Day next week. Toora loo! Riverdance! Feck! Girls! Drink! To be sure! Begorrah! 46 mins: The second-half starts with Liverpool playing into the Kop. Kewell crosses from the left, but Michael Owen is unable to get in front of his man and win the ball. Good defending, but Owen is looking sluggish tonight. Apart from his goal against Levski Sofia in his side's last Uefa Cup match, he's been dire recently. 48 mins: \"I hate 0-0,\" writes Keith McCalmont in Canada. \"I want Owen off. Any sign of Heskey practicing his dribbling on the touchlines?\" Yes there is, Keith. He's got a lovely long bit of drool dangling from the left corner of his mouth, but doesn't seem to have quite mastered the other side yet. I presume that's the kind of dribbling you mean, as the area behind the touchline is far too narrow for him to practice the kind that incorporates the use of a football and his shins. 51 mins: Habib Beye, the Marseille right-back, hacks down Steven Gerrard as the Liverpool midfielder was galloping down the wing. Gerrard whips the free-kick into the box and Didi Hamann plants a header inches over the bar. Great effort, should have scored. 54 mins Liverpool 1 - 0 Marseille A comedy of erros from Marseille results in Liverpool taking the lead. Having been gifted possession in midfield, Owen tried to thread a through-ball into the Marseille box for Steven Gerrard to latch on to. Habib Beye looked to have it under control, but dithered over it and allowed Steven Gerrard poke the ball off his toe and across the box. With the goal gaping, Abdoulyabe Meite and Milan Baros both went for it and the ball ended up being rifled into the net. I couldn't even begin to tell you who got the last touch, but Milan Baros is claiming it and I'm not about to be all Scroogy and suggest it was an own-goal. 55 mins: Pssst!!! 56 mins: Pssst!!! 57 mins: I think it was an own-goal. 60 mins: ATTENTION CELTIC FANS! Tony O'Brien gallops to the rescue: \"If anybody is really interested they can listen to the Celtic match: www.clyde2.com. They can also enter a competition to meet Chris De Burgh.\" Now, don't say we're not good to you. Didier Drogba goes down as if he's been shot in the back after a \"challenge\" from Steven Gerrard. The Liverpool midfielder just laughs at him. 63 mins: Mark Manley writes so that I don't have to bother: \"Sound Editing (half-time entertainment) needs to get a humour transplant or go on over to the BBC for some minute-by-minute where the personality is more to his taste!\" Ouch. 65 mins: A lot of midfield faffery at the moment. Marseille substitutions: Meriem and Ferreira for Perez and Batlles. More industrious work from Baros down the left wing. He pokes the ball towards Owen who, unable to turn, tees up a shot for Didi Hamann. He thunders towards it, he shoots ... he holds his head in his hands in shame. Wide as a ditch. 70 mins: A veritable sending-off festival in the Celtic v Barcelona match, I'm told. More red cards than you can shake an inflatable green plastic shamrock at. Meanwhile back at Anfield, Marseille win ... a throw-in. If I told you I actually wanted to cover the Celtic match, would you think I was lying? None of you ever consider my feelings. Too selfish, the lot of you. Swine. 73 mins: Somewhere around the Liverpool bench Emile Heskey takes off his tracksuit. Although he's standing up, he doesn't trip over the bottoms in a comical hop-haplessly-across-the-bedroom-before-crashing-into-a-wardrobe fashion, like I tend to do while drunk. I'm not suggesting he's drunk, I'm just suggesting we might have been a bit hard on him. Sorry Mr Em. 77 mins Liverpool 1 - 1 Marseille Oh dear! Marseille score a big fat juicy away goal, courtesy of Didier Drogba, their most dangerous player. A Liverpool clearance was lobbed back in over a static defence and into the path of Drogma on the edge of the six-yard box. Despite the close attentions of Steve Finnan, he managed to hold off the Liverpool defender, control the ball and poke it past Chris Kirkland. Great goal. 80 mins: Liverpool almost equalise straight from the kick-off and only an excellent save from Barthez prevents them from reclaiming the lead. An absolutely fantastic one-two between Gerrard and Kewell down the left flank carved open the Marseille defence, giving Gerrard a shot at goal from close range. He blasted it, but Barthez got down quickly and smothered it. 84 mins: Liverpool almost go 2-1 down. Sloppy play from Kewell presents Drogba with another scoring opportunity, but Carragher cleans up at the back. As I was still describing the goal when this happened, there's every chance I got all the characters and the plot of this most recent chapter incorrect, but rest assured it was a close shave. One thing I can tell you for certain is that Heskey has replaced Danny Murphy and Igor Biscan is about to come on. That'll help. 87 mins: Marseille win a free-kick deep inside their own half, which Fabien Barthez refuses to take until Milan Baros goes back the requisite 10 yards. For his troubles, the Marseille goalkeeper gets a yellow card. Liverpool substitution: Biscan for Steve Finnan. 89 mins: Liverpool win a free-kick to the left of the Marseille box. Gerrard whips it in to the far post, where Sami Hyypia lurks. His header is hacked off the line and goes out for a corner, which Marseille clear. 90 +2 mins: Liverpool are peppering the Marseille goal: Baros and Gerrard both have efforts frantically cleared, then the referee blows for full-time. Liverpool all to do in the south of France if they're to progress to the next round of the Uefa Cup. Far more interesting, though, is this stinging rebuke from Rajiv in Montreal (42 mins): \"Actually I don't need your bright and sagacious comments for this game,\" he declares. \"I found two sites that have live minute-by-minute coverage (the commentary is in French). Let me tell you that they are far better than yours and devoid of any insipid Liverpool bashing which obviously is your favourite pastime.\" That's harsh, Rajiv. After all I've done for you. Don't delude yourself thinking that my favourite past-time is Liverpool-bashing. That's well down the list after Manchester United-bashing, Rangers-bashing and, em, bishop-bashing. That's yer lot, have a good evening one and all. Even you Rajiv. And Paul Galea who had this to say: \"Your reporting is childish and largely uninformative. It's hard to believe that a respected paper like the Guardian employs you.\" Teams Liverpool: 22-Chris Kirkland; 3-Steve Finnan, 2-Stephane Henchoz, 4-Sami Hyypia, 23-Jamie Carragher; 7-Harry Kewell; 13-Danny Murphy, 17-Steven Gerrard, 16-Dietmar Hamann; 5-Milan Baros, 10-Michael Owen Subs: Heskey, Diouf, Riise, Sinama Pongolle, Biscan, Cheyrou, Dudek.
