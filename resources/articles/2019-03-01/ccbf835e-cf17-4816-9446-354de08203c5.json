Attorney Keith Durkin said Wednesday that two of Aldrin\u2019s adult children have withdrawn their petition seeking guardianship of Aldrin\u2019s affairs, and the former astronaut, the second person to walk on the moon, has dropped his civil lawsuit against his children and former manager. Aldrin had accused them of financial shenanigans and slandering him. Durkin did not offer any further details. Aldrin sued two of his children and a business partner last summer for elder exploitation and fraud while accusing them of \u201cslander\u201d for suggesting he had dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Aldrin, a fan of human exploration of Mars, claimed that his son Andrew and daughter Janice, who oversee a private company and a non-profit in Aldrin\u2019s name, have been using his legacy along with company funds \u201cfor their own self-dealing and enrichment\u201d. According to the suit filed in Florida, Andrew has pilfered nearly half a million dollars from his father\u2019s personal account in the last two years. Aldrin\u2019s adult children deny the allegations and in a statement said they were \u201cdeeply disappointed and saddened\u201d. On Wednesday, the 89-year-old Aldrin said in a statement that the end of the legal fighting will help restore family harmony. In a separate statement, Andrew and Janice asked for privacy in allowing the family to work through their issues. Previously, Aldrin\u2019s children had applied for co-guardianship over their father on the basis that he is in \u201ccognitive decline\u201d. \u201cNobody is going to come close to thinking I should be under a guardianship,\u201d Aldrin said in an interview at the time, according to the Wall Street Journal. The suit also accused Aldrin\u2019s children of forbidding him to remarry and of having \u201cundermined, bullied and defamed\u201d all of Aldrin\u2019s personal romantic relationships. Also named in the suit was Christina Korp, who, like Aldrin\u2019s children is an administrator in both the Aldrin organizations: the Buzz Aldrin Space Foundation and Buzz Aldrin Enterprises."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
