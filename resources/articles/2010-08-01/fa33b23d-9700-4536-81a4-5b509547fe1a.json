We are getting relatively poorer fast. But over the longer term, the real point is the failure of our financial services and banks to deliver growth and assure our economic wellbeing. Up to the recession in 1990, when our economy switched from manufacturing to banking services, we were accustomed to growth rates of 2%-5%. Since then anything above 1.5% is a cause for celebration. Right now, the banks are transparent that to keep the price of their commodity (money) high, they are prepared to restrict its availability (M4 has fallen by 50% since 2008), thereby placing a cap on GDP and so reducing growth \u2013 it's in their interest to do so. So, we should ask ourselves the question: is public sector cost too high \u2013 or GDP and economic growth too low? And then ask the question Michael Moore asks in his recent film: has there been a financial coup d'etat by the banks? Professor Saville Kushner University of the West of England Barry Kushner Blue Urban Sky, Liverpool \u2022 Consumer Focus says banks \"need to offer affordable short-term loans\" (1.2 million employees take out expensive payday loans, 14 August) \u2013 something that is unlikely to happen, given that such loans rarely bring the returns banks demand. However, credit unions, although they are not yet visible on every high street, are growing fast. My own union offers loans from \u00a350 to \u00a37,500, with interest rates from 10.9% to a max of 26.8%, with no hidden fees.
