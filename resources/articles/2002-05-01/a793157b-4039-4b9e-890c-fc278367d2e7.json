The report will be closely scrutinised not just by the thousands who invested in splits - wondering if they can hope to recoup their losses - but by Class Law, the legal firm which last week launched initial proceedings against fund managers, brokers, advisers and anyone else who had a role in persuading us to buy splits. Superficially, there is a cast iron case for redress. Splits were promoted by everyone, from fund managers down, as a low-risk investment suitable for the proverbial widows and orphans. Even professional advisers were not aware that, beneath the surface, many split capital trusts were burdened by huge debts and a web of cross-holdings which made them extremely vulnerable to even a small drop in the market. So how were private investors to work out that a 30% fall in the stock market could effectively wipe out their investment? But the question is, should they have been aware of the possibility of high risk? If investors and their advisers had done their research more diligently, would they have realised that the promised returns really were too good to be true? Certainly, there are signs that advisers and stockbrokers relied far too heavily on the sales pitch of the fund managers. The small print of the prospectuses will certainly have disclosed that the trusts had the power, and the intention, to borrow heavily, and could invest in shares of other trusts. While it would have taken a mathematical genius to work out exactly what this would mean if the stock market fell - indeed, Merrill Lynch says splits should be priced using the complicated formula normally reserved for options - these factors should at least have spurred intermediaries to ask the managers a few searching questions. That may not have got them very far, however. Martin Gilbert, chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management - which, with Exeter and BFS, is behind most of the distressed splits - admits that 'with hindsight' it was clear that high borrowings and cross-holdings were a potent cocktail. If his staff, paid handsomely to analyse the risks and rewards of investing, did not with foresight realise this either, investors would be right to question their competence. It is disingenuous to point out, as he does in briefing papers sent to anyone with an interest in splits, that shares in such companies as Marconi, Colt and Telewest also plunged. Anyone who buys shares in individual companies should know the risks involved. Were the risks of the split capital trusts made equally clear? As far as zero dividend preference shares are concerned, the answer is almost certainly not. Aimed at investors seeking capital growth, these were supposed to repay a fixed sum at some future date. While the amount of the repayment was never actually guaranteed, they were universally described as low risk. Even the most skilled defence lawyer would surely accept that, when around a third of all zeros have lost up to 95% of their value, low risk is not an appropriate description. Those who bought these shares directly from the fund manager or through their financial adviser should complain first to them then, if they get no satisfaction, go to the financial ombudsman. The position of income shareholders is less clear cut. Prospectuses and other marketing literature will have made it clear there was a risk that investors could lose some, or all, of their original investment. But the risk that the dividend could be cut, or disappear completely, was probably rather less prominently displayed. The number of people who have lost out will not be that large, given that more than two-thirds of income shares were bought by other split capital investment trusts. But those who have been affected are likely to have been wiped out. If the FSA finds any evidence of a magic circle, pressure for compensation for both income and zero holders will be intense. The report, in a fortnight, is unlikely to be conclusive. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence: one prominent fund manager said it decided not to launch a split when rivals made it clear that success would depend on joining the 'magic circle'. Converting that into documentary evidence is much harder. The real pity is that all the managers involved are relatively small - Aberdeen, for example, is worth just \u00a3400m - and so could not afford a compensation package like that offered by Deutsche Bank to investors in funds managed by Peter Young, who milked them of \u00a3220m. That is a pity: it is what split investors deserve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
