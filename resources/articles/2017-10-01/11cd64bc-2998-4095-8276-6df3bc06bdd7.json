Kelly made an unannounced appearance at the White House podium on Thursday afternoon amid an unprecedented feud between Trump and Frederica Wilson, a Democratic congresswoman who overheard the president tell the widow of Sgt La David Johnson that her husband \u201cknew what he signed up for\u201d before he was killed on duty in Niger. Breaking years of silence over the death of his own son in Afghanistan, Kelly said he was \u201cbroken-hearted\u201d by the politicization of troops who died on the battlefield. \u201cIt stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation, absolutely stuns me,\u201d said Kelly, while adding he was so incensed by the episode that he \u201cwalked among the stones\u201d at Arlington national cemetery for an hour and a half on Wednesday. \u201cI thought at least that was sacred \u2026 but it [was] eroded a great deal yesterday by the selfish behavior of a member of Congress.\u201d Kelly, however, he failed to acknowledge that this week\u2019s furor began when Trump launched an unprompted attack on his predecessors Barack Obama and George W Bush over their outreach to bereaved military families. Kelly went on to offer a protracted justification for what he said was Trump\u2019s attempt to offer his condolences to Johnson\u2019s wife, Myeshia. Kelly said there was \u201cno perfect way to make that phone call\u201d. Also on Thursday, in a sign of a possible fight ahead over the ambush in Niger, which left four US soldiers dead, Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate armed services committee, said he might consider issuing a subpoena because the White House had not been forthcoming with details of what happened. \u201cIt may require a subpoena,\u201d McCain said when asked what steps his committee might need to take to determine what happened to the four troops. Questioned about what information the committee still needed, he said: \u201cEverything.\u201d Asked whether the White House had been forthcoming with the information the committee needed, he added: \u201cOf course not.\u201d Kelly, recounting the day when he was informed of his son\u2019s death, recalled his close friend Gen Joseph Dunford arriving at his doorstep. Dunford had told him his son \u201cwas doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed\u201d, Kelly recalled. \u201cHe knew what he was getting into by joining that 1% [who serve in uniform],\u201d Kelly said, seeking to convey the nuance lacking in Trump\u2019s own reaction to the controversy. \u201cHe knew what the possibilities were, because we\u2019re at war.\u201d Kelly added: \u201cThat\u2019s what the president tried to say to the four families the other day.\u201d Describing Trump as \u201cbrave\u201d for making the calls, Kelly said the president had sought his counsel on how to handle them. Kelly said he told the president that those who were not family, had never worn the uniform, and who did not serve, \u201ccan\u2019t even imagine how to make that call\u201d. Wilson was not alone in her interpretation of the call. Johnson\u2019s mother also took issue with Trump\u2019s tone, telling reporters on Wednesday: \u201cPresident Trump did disrespect my son and my daughter and also me and my husband.\u201d Trump claimed this week that former presidents did not contact the families of fallen troops. In particular, Trump said Obama did not call Kelly after his son Robert was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. Trump\u2019s remark prompted former Obama administration officials to reveal that six months after his son\u2019s death, Kelly and his wife had been invited to a White House breakfast for bereaved Gold Star military families and sat at Michelle Obama\u2019s table. Kelly confirmed on Wednesday that he had not received a call from Obama, but clarified that presidents did not always reach out by phone to grieving families and often chose instead to write letters. \u201cThat was not a criticism,\u201d Kelly said of Obama. \u201cThat\u2019s not a negative thing.\u201d A visibly emotional Kelly focused his initial comments on what happens when a service member dies, explaining in heart-wrenching detail the process of bringing the body home and notifying the next of kin. \u201cI appeal to America \u2013 let\u2019s try to keep that sacred,\u201d he said. However, he became increasingly angry as he deplored the politicization of military deaths. Although speaking from personal experience, Kelly was undeniably operating simultaneously as the White House chief of staff \u2013 cleaning up a political mess created by his boss. He proceeded to take questions only from reporters who personally knew Gold Star families, telling the room an investigation into the attack in Niger was under way. \u201cThe fact is they need to find out what happened and why it happened,\u201d Kelly said, before reverting back to his role as a retired four-star marine general by concluding his remarks with a plea to members of the media. \u201cUnderstand there\u2019s tens of thousands of America\u2019s kids, mostly, doing the nation\u2019s bidding,\u201d Kelly said, observing that unlike in his day, when there was a draft, those serving today were doing so by choice. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to be in uniform. These young people today, they don\u2019t do it for any other reason than their sense of selfless devotion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
