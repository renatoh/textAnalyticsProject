His previous business, a mail-order cosmetics company, collapsed, leaving him and his associates with nothing. \"We mortgaged the building I'm sitting in now, and started again with Lush. You're paranoid about making mistakes. That's why we cut away anything that was wasted money.\" He's referring to the famously minimal packaging of Lush's freshly made soaps, which produces the enticing waft that cloaks its shops. The smell and karmic satisfaction of Lush shopping made the company an instant success with the public. The products are handmade from natural ingredients without animal fat or animal testing. Its good deeds stretch far beyond what goes into its shampoos, however. Ethical principles are writ large over the Lush brand \u2013 sometimes literally. A campaign to provide legal aid to Guantanamo prisoners saw staff donning bright orange underpants reading \"Fair Trial My Arse\", supported by a bath bomb offer to \"buy one, set one free\". The initiative raised crucial funds and awareness for human rights organisation Reprieve, whose work eventually led to the release of two prisoners. \"I remember the first time I saw a company list 'We Pay Tax' as one of its ethical standards. I'd never even thought of not paying tax!\" says Constantine. It's another contentious area in which Lush outperforms the field. \"We pay 44.5% tax over our total business. Our close competitors pay 33.4%. Last year the Body Shop paid 13.9%.\" The relationship with the Body Shop is a frosty one. In his 20s, Constantine was close to the late Anita Roddick, as well as being the Body Shop's largest product supplier, until she bought his company out. In 2006, the Body Shop itself was taken over, by L'Or\u00e9al, in a controversial \u00a3652m deal. \"Ethical business practice has been so hard won, and there are so few surviving, vigorous models. Body Shop should have been one of them.\" Lush keeps a close eye on its own house, with salaries at the top not rising more than 17 times above those at the bottom; a ratio even conscientious competitors such as John Lewis don't come close to. It goes beyond basic fair-trade agreements and invests at grassroots level with the communities that produce its ingredients, with a minimum of 2% of money spent on raw materials poured back into sustainable farming projects. From regenerating forest ecology in Peru, to supporting women growing aloe in arid regions of Kenya, it currently oversees schemes in 19 different countries. It donates to animal rights protestors and backs anti-aviation, road and fracking groups. Lush expects to turn over \u00a3486m this year, from stores in 50 countries. Do such comprehensive ethical commitments ever make it feel overstretched? \"Sometimes. But it's the right thing to do,\" says Constantine. \"Plus, you don't get so downcast when you're not successful, because there's always another fight.\" Runners-up: Ento, We Deliver Local"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
