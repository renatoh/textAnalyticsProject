It's your mate. \"Whazzaaap!\" he shouts down the line. What do you do? Whazzaaap him back? No, of course you don't. You're going to be a bit confused. You're going to want to know why the hell he's giving you a whazzaaap. Whazzaaap is something people said - when was it? - five years ago, not now. What's going on? That's how watching Wife Swap (Channel 4) made me feel. The whole thing was a misjudged whazzaaap moment. \"Meet the Stricklands,\" begins the commentary man. Oh God, here we go again. Do we really have to meet the Stricklands? I know what the Stricklands will be like, and the Rickards. Michele and Yvonne will swap, and shout, and squabble. It won't be amusing any more, just sad. So what's it to be this time, then? Posh v chav? God v not? Boozers v teetotallers? Oh, I see, Michele's a lazy slob while Yvonne's a compulsive cleaner. And they're the opposite in their relationships, too: if Michele is a pair of boots and walks all over her fella, then Yvonne's a doormat. All of them are tedious and ghastly, and it's making me depressed. When it started out, Wife Swap was fabulously entertaining. It wasn't just a great idea, it was one of the most interesting of reality shows. It may even have worked as some kind of family therapy for the people involved, and made us at home think about our own families. But this is series six, and it hasn't moved on in any way. Wake me up if a swapping wife cops off with the other one's husband. Or murders all the other one's children. Otherwise, leave me be. There aren't infinite different types of cheese, or chalk. We've had them all. The horse isn't just dead, it's heaving with maggots. Stop flogging it. The Real Goodfella (Channel 4) was about a character called Henry Hill, on whom Martin Scorsese based the character played by Ray Liotta in Goodfellas. We're constantly reminded that the real-life mafia is a lot more scary than the movie mafia: \"The mob,\" we're told, \"was far more vicious than Goodfellas could ever portray.\" More vicious than Goodfellas? That is vicious. We're also told: \"When the movie ends, the darkest part of Henry's life began.\" Another wise guy, Jimmy Burke, is \"a gangster far more dangerous and psychotic than Goodfellas could ever show.\" It's enough to make you think that Goodfellas was some kind of Disney kids' film. But then we meet Mr Hill himself, and he's just this little old fella. He's obviously no angel, but can he really be as bad as the commentary makes out? His language is certainly bad. He explains how they used to rip off the transport business: \"We had the fucking shop stewards, the fucking bosses of the fucking union, you know, they were fucked.\" Yes, but really you just got in with the wrong crowd, didn't you Mr Hill? And then you took too many drugs, and then you ratted on your old mates, because you're a rat. And then you got scared they were going to come and get you. Hill came across as more of a sad man than a bad man. Someone who talks the talk without walking the walk. Which, with all its boasting about the real mob being much worse than the movie mob, is rather how the film behaves, too. Extraordinary People: Identical Quads (Five) was nice. The chance of identical quads, conceived in the old-fashioned way without any fertility treatment or anything, isn't great: round about one in 11 million. Which may be why Alison and Steve feel so special about theirs. \"Of all the people in the whole wide world, I got picked. How cool is that?\" says Alison, beaming. The chances of them all being fine aren't great either. But these kids are all very healthy. Steve describes their birth: \"Everything started happening, and then they just started pulling babies out.\" First Grace then Emily, Marie Claire and Anna: out they came, one after the other, all tiny and exactly the same, like little tadpoles. Now they're little girls, and off to school for the first time, all dressed the same, with their hair done in the same way. Sometimes even Steve has trouble telling them apart, and they have to tell him who they are. They're going to be able to get up to so much mischief, all through their lives, those ladies. I hope they do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
