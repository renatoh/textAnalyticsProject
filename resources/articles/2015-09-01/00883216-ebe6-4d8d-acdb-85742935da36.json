The survey of nearly 1,100 parents of school-age children \u2013 conducted by Opinium Research on behalf of Santander bank \u2013 also found that some parents were willing to pay a substantial premium to buy houses close to desirable schools. Using data from the Land Registry and the Registers of Scotland, the survey found that respondents were willing to pay 18% more for a property near their favoured school \u2013 equivalent to \u00a332,000 on the average price of nearly \u00a3180,000 in England, Wales and Scotland. Parents in London \u2013 where property prices are well above the national average \u2013 were more likely to pay a higher premium of \u00a377,000 on a house costing \u00a3474,000. But those surveyed in the north-east and Scotland were paying the highest premium in terms of percentage: 21% in Scotland, adding \u00a334,000, and 21% in the north-east, adding \u00a321,000. In Wales, where the average house price was \u00a3117,000, families were paying a further 15%, or \u00a317,000, to be within range of a desirable school. Only in Yorkshire and Humberside was the school premium percentage in single figures: 8%, or \u00a39,500, on top of an average house sale worth \u00a3123,000. \u201cWith competition for school places fiercer than ever, parents are making significant financial and lifestyle sacrifices to be within the catchment area of desirable schools,\u201d said Miguel Sard, Santander UK\u2019s managing director of mortgages. \u201cAll buyers will have a wish list of what they want their new home to have, and being within a certain school catchment is increasingly common among young families but can often come at a cost.\u201d Many of those surveyed \u2013 weighted by income groups according to the UK population \u2013 who had bought a new house said they had to work extra hours or change jobs as a result. One in four of the 287 buyers reported that they had \u201cpaid significantly more for a property\u201d than they could afford. The bulk of state schools in England and Wales admit pupils based on their proximity to the school, meaning that the closer a family lives to their preferred school, the more likely they are to gain entrance. The recent baby boom in England has put greater pressure on school places, especially for the parents of primary school-age children in south-east England and in cities such as Birmingham and Brighton, which have experienced rapid growth in recent years. Of those parents with children aged four to 18, about 10% said they had sold their old house and moved to a new one within a desired school catchment area. A further 11% said they had bought a second property in a specific catchment, and 5% said they had rented a second property for the same reason \u2013 which comes close to breaking the rules set by local authorities governing admissions to schools in their area. Councils generally require applications to be made from a child\u2019s main residence \u2013 and councils such as Camden and Islington in north London have uncovered multiple examples of parents using mail-drop addresses in order to appear closer to sought-after schools. In one high-profile case in north London, a couple bribed a builder who was renovating a house near a highly desirable school to forward mail to their real address. But they later lost a school place after they were caught out by neighbours. In most cases, local authorities require evidence of council tax payment and electoral-roll registration as proof of address \u2013 meaning there is little to stop parents renting or buying a property and using it as a basis to apply, so long as they are not paying council tax on a second residence. The survey also found a similar number of families were considering making such moves within the next two years to obtain a school place, with 8% looking to buy a house near a school and 17% prepared to buy or rent a second property. The figures also showed that parents of younger children were more likely to move than parents of those aged over 11."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
