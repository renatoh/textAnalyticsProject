Virginia also elected its first Muslim state senator and Democrats took control of both the state senate and house for the first time in more than two decades. The viral photo of Juli Briskman giving the middle finger to Trump\u2019s motorcade while riding a bike was a key part of her campaign to be on the county board of supervisors in the Virginia county that includes the Trump National Golf Club. Briskman will represent her district in Loudoun county, near Washington DC, after defeating the incumbent Republican. Briskman lost her job as a government contractor after the photo went viral in 2017. She filed a wrongful-termination lawsuit, which was dismissed, but she successfully sued for severance. \u201cIt was just sort of like, here I am on my bike. I\u2019ve got nothing, right?\u201d Briskman told the Guardian in November 2017. \u201cThis is pretty much the only thing I had to express my opinion. He wasn\u2019t going to hear me through bullet-proof glass \u2026 So that was pretty much how I could say what I wanted to say, right?\u201d Also in Virginia on Tuesday, the first Muslim state senator was elected. Ghazala Hashmi, a Democrat, focused her campaign on improving education in the state to defeat the Republican incumbent. Hashmi said in a statement: \u201cThank you for all of you who, regardless of party, want to build a stronger, safer, and more equitable Commonwealth.\u201d Hashmi was also one of several candidates elected to state positions in Virginia who championed gun safety reform. The advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety said candidates who support stricter gun laws are now the majority in Virginia\u2019s House and Senate, primarily because Democrats are now the majority in the state. Virginia, which borders Washington DC, has traditionally been conservative \u2013 choosing Republican candidates in every presidential election from 1968 to 2004, according to the Washington Post. Overnight, Virginia\u2019s Democrat governor, Ralph Northam, declared: \u201cI\u2019m here to officially declare today, November 5, 2019, that Virginia is officially blue.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
