The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) confirmed on Wednesday that it is investigating how the toy note was passed over the counter inside a fast food outlet in Newry, Co Down. After paying for the sandwich the person using the note received and kept all of the change. A message posted on the PSNI\u2019s Newry station Facebook page said: \u201cIt\u2019s a pretend 100 euro note from a leading kiddies\u2019 toy store. \u201cSo why do we have it in an evidence bag I hear you query? Well it\u2019s in an evidence bag because it\u2019s evidence. Evidence of the offence of tendering counterfeit currency. \u201cI know, I know a kids play note counterfeit currency?? Well believe it or not this was actually accepted as payment recently in business premises in Newry.\u201d Newry is a bi-currency city due to its close proximity to the border with the Irish Republic, with most of its shops accepting euros as well as sterling. Later, the PSNI called on all counter staff to be more vigilant when handling notes: \u201cIf you work in a cash handling job please take five seconds to check all notes you are accepting. The first check would be look at the thing! \u201cThe second would be to swipe a counterfeit detector pen across it, you can buy these online for pennies. Then consider the feel of the note.\u201d The PSNI added: \u201cClearly no checks were done on this note and that business is now \u20ac100 down plus the value of the goods it was used to \u2018pay\u2019 for!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
