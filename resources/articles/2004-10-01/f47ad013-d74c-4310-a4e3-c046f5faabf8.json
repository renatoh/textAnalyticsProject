Gascoigne joined the League Two club as a player-coach in the summer but has struggled to make an impact on the pitch and is now keen to pursue a career in coaching. The 37-year-old said that that he would be leaving York Street with immediate effect and that he hoped to complete an intensive coaching course at Lilleshall. \"I've got an opportunity with [the England coach] Sammy Lee coming up,\" said Gascoigne. \"There are no hard feelings between me and Boston - I have left on professional reasons and hopefully they can understand that.\" Tottenham's chairman Daniel Levy today predicted a bright future for Spurs - despite announcing a loss of \u00a31.189m for the year ended June 30 2004. The club have invested heavily in strengthening the squad and installed a new management structure in the hope of bringing success to White Hart Lane. Spurs' heavy expenditure has been reflected in their accounts, which reveal an operating profit of \u00a39.7m until transfers are included, resulting in an overall loss. However, Levy believes the club are now in a sound position to restore their reputation. \"Following a process of change within the club we now have in place a structure that we hope will bring a steady return to the winning performance we all desire for Tottenham Hotspur,\" he said in a statement to the Stock Exchange. He conceded Spurs could not hope to continue with their current level of expenditure but insisted the outlay on players, which totals \u00a337.5m since July 1 2003, proved that the club are ambitious.
