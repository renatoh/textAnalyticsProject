While there is not space here to list fully the reasons for not quitting that cosy job in the bank, suffice to say that while many people think that they have a novel in them, it is almost certainly not something anybody else would want to read. Whether they have done a 'comprehensive', \u00a3250 learn-to-write course or not, what surprises most first-time novelists is the difficulty of the enterprise. It's not quite up there with quantum mechanics - maths is to most writers what kryptonite is to Superman - but you will undoubtedly need an editor. Editors work for publishers, and to get a publisher you'll need an agent, who will take a cut of between 10 and 20 per cent. Bear in mind that an independent agency such as Curtis Brown will receive 200 unsolicited manuscripts each week. Your publisher's advance, typically \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000 for commercial fiction, is intended to tide you over while you write the book and before the royalties trickle in. So, if you can knock off a novel every three or four weeks, you're clearly on to a good thing. Now that you're on your way, you'll need something to write with. Traditionalists stick to pen and paper, progressives may have moved up to a typewriter, while those venturing into the white-heat of the zeitgeist may have invested in a laptop. Yes, it has a memory and you can play games on it and surf the net, but sooner or later it will stab you in the back. You will also need somewhere to write. Famously, Philip Pullman writes in his garden shed and you can pick a well-appointed one from a garden centre for \u00a31,300. Alternatively, if you think it might provide a little more inspiration, the house that WB Yeats used to live in, 3 Blenheim Road, Chiswick, is currently for sale for \u00a31.3m. Other essential purchases include a dictionary with which to hone your vocabulary. The one to get is the \u00a380 New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (in two volumes) which boasts impressive statistics: 220,000 entries and 500,000 definitions in 3,836 pages. The next most useful book is probably Macmillan's Writer's Handbook.
