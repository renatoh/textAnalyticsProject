(Spoiler alert: he really wasn\u2019t.) Even that expensively acquired self-belief may have suffered a wobble, however, given the reaction to Cameron\u2019s announcement that he was scarpering from Westminster (sample from the Telegraph\u2019s James Kirkup: \u201cpetulant ... no big idea... a lack of seriousness\u201d \u2013 you get the picture). It\u2019s been a humbling few days for the former PM, forced to watch Theresa May coolly reversing his decisions, one by one. Grammar schools, opposed by Cameron, back on the agenda. The chair of the BBC Trust Rona Fairhead, whom he reappointed, gone. Now, the lowest blow of all. The Bullingdon Club, it has emerged, is threatened with extinction because nobody wants to join. \u201cEvery reasonable person thinks it\u2019s a joke,\u201d said a mole. Well, yes. Like we say, not a great week for Cameron. On the other hand, this fact alone may have cheered yours immensely, so every cloud and all that. Tuesday TV audiences have inevitably been smaller for the Paralympics than last month\u2019s Olympics, which is a shame because there\u2019s no doubt the games have showcased plenty of sporting brilliance. Consider, for example, the T13 1500m men\u2019s final, won by the Algerian Abdellatif Baka in a world record time of 3:48.29. Ethiopia\u2019s Tamiru Demisse and Kenyan Henry Kirwa claimed silver and bronze, while Baka\u2019s brother Fouad just missed a medal in fourth. Runners in the T13 category are visually impaired, which makes it particularly striking that each of the first four finishers, had they been competing in the Olympics 1500m final on 20 August, would have beaten the entire field, including Matt Centrowitz who claimed gold for the US in a snail-like time of 3:50.00. The American\u2019s victory came in a highly tactical race that got off to an unusually slow start, but still. Did someone say \u201cbackwards and in heels\u201d? Wednesday A big week for food-based transportation calamity headline gags, which \u2013 speaking personally \u2013 has been just about the only thing that has got me through. First, of course, there was the embarrassing pasta disaster on the A5 near Shotatton in Shropshire, where a lorry slopped 20 tonnes of spaghetti bolognese across the carriageway. Then came that incident with the tanker transporting molasses off the Cumbrian coast which \u2013 dear reader, you are ahead of me \u2013 got stuck. Is it just possible, all the same, that we have overindulged just a little on the food puns with the news that a baking programme is moving channels? I mean, crumbs, newspapers do like to rise to the challenge when faced with these ingredients, but whether we kneaded quite so many overcooked puns about the Great British Bake Off\u2019s BBC1 departure is a matter of taste. Let\u2019s all agree: the BBC got burned, Mel and Sue were delicious and Breadxit means Breadxit. Now can we leave it there? I\u2019m feeling queasy. Thursday So we are, after all, to have a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point, after May declined to overturn her predecessor\u2019s bafflingly unfavourable deal with its Chinese backers. For all their glee at the Hinkley contract, the real prize for Chinese investors is a potential new plant at Bradwell, on a sparse stretch of coast near Maldon in Essex. Bradwell, as it happens, has been of interest to incomers for some time. Just east of the power station site is a small stone building that could pass for a ramshackle old barn. It is, instead, the chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall, built by St Cedd, a missionary from Lindisfarne, in 654, which makes it probably the second oldest church in Britain. Cedd\u2019s builder-monks reused stones from the Roman fort of Othona, and the tiny, single-roomed chapel stands at the end of an arrow-straight stretch of Roman road, with just the North Sea behind. It feels like a miraculous survival from another time, perched on the very edge of the world. Do visit before the chaps in radiation suits and the three-eyed fish take over. Friday Sometimes life writes its own punchlines. So it must seem, at least, for Rebecca Moss, who sailed from Vancouver last month on board a container ship bound for Shanghai. Moss, 25, is an \u201cabsurdist artist\u201d and her project \u201c23 Days at Sea\u201d was intended to examine the comedic friction between mechanical systems and nature. In a textbook case of \u201cbe careful what you wish for\u201d, however, the Hanjin Shipping Company, which owns the tanker, went bust on 31 August, leaving the ship stranded at sea since port operators, afraid they won\u2019t be paid, have refused to let them dock. Meat and drink for an absurdist artist, one might think. Maybe so, but when contacted by email on Friday for an update, it was clear the comedy of the situation was wearing thin for Moss. She is looking forward, she said, to \u201cbeing out of this situation and to be in a position to reflect back on it. When you are in it, the stress is hard to manage.\u201d Friday was the day she was due to disembark; her plan was to spend a few days with collaborators in Shanghai before flying home to London. \u201cNow this is looking somewhat unlikely.\u201d Quite enough absurdity for one lifetime.
