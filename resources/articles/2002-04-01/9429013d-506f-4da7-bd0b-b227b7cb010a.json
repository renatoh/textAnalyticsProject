Hughes has been restricting himself to no more than a couple of rides a day while completing his recovery, but expects to be close to peak fitness for the Craven meeting at Newmarket next week. \"It's good to be back,\" the 29-year-old said. \"I've still got a bit of a limp, but it's getting better every day.\" Big Bopper was by far the biggest horse in yesterday's race, which is not always the best thing to be on the tight turns of Brighton, but he coped with the track well. \"He is a massive horse, 16 hands high, and I was worried about the track,\" said his trainer Richard Hannon, who is also Hughes's father-in-law. \"But it was the obvious race. He has done well from two to three and I'd hope he will be a decent horse this season.\" Meanwhile, the Tote has increased its betting-shop estate to almost 400 outlets with the purchase of the 30-strong Manny Bernstein chain. The shops are based mainly in the east Midlands, where the Tote has previously had a minimal presence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
