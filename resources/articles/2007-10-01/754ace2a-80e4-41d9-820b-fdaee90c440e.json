The money - up from \u00a32m this year - is to be channelled over three years to groups which promote integration, rather than towards bodies which represent a single ethnic or religious identity. The change in approach is to be accompanied by guidance to local authorities that they should only spend money on translating documents into foreign languages where necessary, and put a much greater emphasis on teaching English. The introduction of specialist teams is designed to help local authorities to deal with any rise in tensions between communities and rapid changes in their population. The experts, who may be based in the Department for Communities and Local Government, may provide mediation skills, develop community relations and plan public services. The measures are contained in the government's official response to the report earlier this year from the Commission on Integration and Cohesion, with an admission by ministers that recent eastern European migration had proved \"a shock to the system\". The initiatives include information packs for migrants about what is expected of them, including national laws and local traditions, from no drink-driving to no fishing without a licence in local rivers, and toleration of other faiths and communities. Ms Blears is also to push ahead with the promotion of new citizens' days in local authorities in England, following successful pilots in four cities. The first-ever citizens' day, in Southwark, south London, included opportunities to try out pie and mash and featured banners reading I Love Peckham in 48 languages. But the official response, set out in a letter to Darra Singh, chief executive of Ealing council, west London, and chair of the integration and cohesion commission, stops short of endorsing a national day along the lines of Australia Day. The proposal is understood to be under consideration by Gordon Brown. Ms Blears told Mr Singh: \"As a government and a country, we must be honest [that] there are issues we need to address as a result of new patterns of migration and ensure that we have the ideas and policies to tackle them over the next 10 years.\" The shift in funding to groups which promote integration has been criticised by the National Association for Voluntary and Community Action, which has raised fears that it could trigger a funding crisis for some minority ethnic groups. But Ted Cantle, who heads the Institute of Community Cohesion, has defended the approach, arguing that with 120 languages spoken in most UK cities, the point has been passed where every group is going to get a community centre."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
