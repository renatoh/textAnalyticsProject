In the week of the NHS\u2019s 70th birthday, Sir Amyas Morse said there should be enough common ground across the political spectrum to find extra funding and form a new, united vision for health and social care in the 21st century. \u201cAs we mark the 70th birthday, political leaders should be leading a debate about where we want this national asset to go and they should aim high,\u201d the National Audit Office comtroller told the Guardian. \u201cThis is a topic where there is a lot of consensus out there. I would like politicians to be willing to think bigger.\u201d Morse\u2019s intervention comes as the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, confirmed that significant planning had gone in to preparing the health service for a possible no-deal Brexit leading to a shortfall in vital medicines. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn is facing a warning from three former Labour health secretaries that a hard Brexit could damage the UK\u2019s healthcare system. To mark the anniversary, the prime minister has promised to increase NHS annual spending to \u00a3135bn by 2023-24, a \u00a320bn increase on this year\u2019s budget, and equivalent to an average annual increase of 3.4%. But Morse said the funding increase would only serve to maintain current service levels and would not be enough to meet the needs of a rapidly changing demographic. \u201cThe funding increases we have heard about are very much welcome but are just in healthcare,\u201d he said. \u201cNonetheless, nobody is pretending it is doing more than sustaining the current services.\u201d Morse wants ministers to oversee the NHS\u2019s expansion into a \u201cbigger and better\u201d and \u201cfully developed\u201d healthcare system that would be much better equipped to provide improved care to Britain\u2019s ageing and growing population and the 15 million people who already have at least one long-term health condition such as diabetes, cancer, heart or lung problems, dementia or depression. He wants ministers and NHS leaders to transform the way the service works by offering patients far more healthcare at home instead of in hospitals, in order to keep people healthier and independent for longer and avoid costly and potentially dangerous stays in hospital. The NHS also needs to make a huge leap in the amount of care it provides to those suffering mental illness. Only one in four adults and children who are troubled get help from the NHS. Morse\u2019s ambitious vision for the NHS came with a warning, though, that Britain would have to start investing close to the same levels of its GDP into healthcare as countries such as Germany, which put in a lot more. Cuts in real terms to social care provision would damage the health service, Morse said, and lead to \u201ccost shunting\u201d from social care to the NHS. \u201cIt is quite clear that if you don\u2019t have a balance of capabilities between social care and healthcare, then you are just going to be tipping people from one to the other,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is necessary to have enough funding going into social care so it is retentive of people living as far as possible independently and not falling back into the health services. \u201cI cannot see that the amount being spent on social care, which is now less than it was, and with other signs of pressure in that system, I can\u2019t see that that can be sustainable,\u201d said Morse. May\u2019s 2017 claim that the Conservative government has introduced a parity of esteem in relation to mental health was also questioned by Morse, who expressed concern that it could create an expectation that could not be met. He said: \u201cWhen you announce \u2018parity of esteem\u2019 on mental health, those words are carefully crafted but for most people they sound like \u2018we are going to do a lot more in mental health\u2019. So to make an announcement like that is significant. That would push us in that direction whether or not the funds are all necessarily available. When you make statements like that you are creating expectations. You are unlocking demand.\u201d Morse, 69, plans to step down from the NAO next year. He said he was a regular user of the NHS and wanted a service that sought to prevent illness and maintain people\u2019s health away from acute services. \u201cThe best thing you can do for someone is to keep them out of hospital and living well. And that\u2019s not just old people,\u201d he said. In an echo of suggestions by the health select committee and the Institute for Government thinktank, Morse said politicians and the civil service should launch a proper cross-party examination of what a future NHS should look like. \u201cI want us to recognise that the NHS has developed into its current state in response to various pressures. It is not clear to me that it has developed in response to any sort of vision for a very long time. There was a shared vision at the very start. Is there a shared vision now? I am not sure,\u201d he said. Stevens told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that priority had gone to securing medical supplies and equipment in the event of no post-Brexit deal with the EU. \u201cNobody is in any doubt whatsoever that ... in terms of ensuring continued supplies for all the thing that we need in this country, at the top of the list has got to be those medical supplies,\u201d he said. Frank Dobson, Alan Milburn and Alan Johnson are among the signatories to a letter, seen by the Guardian, urging the Labour leader to take the NHS into account when setting out his party\u2019s Brexit policy. \u201cLabour is the party of the NHS,\u201d they say. \u201cAs we prepare to celebrate its 70th anniversary, it is vital that we are on the right side of the arguments about Brexit and its potential impact on the NHS. If not, future generation will not forgive us.\u201d Asked about the possibility of a referendum on Sky News on Sunday, Corbyn said: \u201cLook, we\u2019ve not proposed it, we\u2019ve not supported it and we\u2019re not proposing it now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
