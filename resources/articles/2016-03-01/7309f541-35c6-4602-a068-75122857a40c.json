Hazard, 25, who had unwisely swapped shirts with \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda at half-time, was brought off 13 minutes from time in the Champions League elimination by Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, departing to boos from a section of the home support. The Belgian\u2019s father, Thierry, has since suggested his son has been playing at Chelsea\u2019s request despite being in pain since sustaining a hip problem during the defeat at Leicester City in December, an injury that has served to blunt his threat. Yet Hiddink, while conceding the player was still enduring the after-effects of that clash with Jamie Vardy in what proved to be Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s final game in charge, has spoken at length to the club\u2019s physiologists and analysis department about Hazard\u2019s performance against PSG. The data collated from that game suggested he covered more ground than any team-mate besides Cesc F\u00e0bregas while he was on the pitch, with many of his runs logged as high intensity, and is therefore not categorised to be in the \u201cfatigue zone\u201d where the risk of sustaining injury is higher. That has left Hiddink considering other ways to draw form from his player. \u201cHe is committed, which is why I defend him, but he\u2019s also concerned a bit about delivering more,\u201d the interim manager said. \u201cI hate it if players are getting a bit \u2018indifferent\u2019 because I want them to force themselves to the limit, and Eden is not \u2018indifferent\u2019. Everyone has his own charisma. If you look at Diego Costa, he\u2019s very outspoken and if he\u2019s angry you know he\u2019s angry. Eden is more introspective and doesn\u2019t really show what he\u2019s thinking, but different people offer up different expressions. It doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not involved. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with people like him in the past and, most of the time, it\u2019s about not overthinking it. You have to go back to behaving spontaneously. Sure, that last percentage of getting top fit will help him get where he wants to be. But for him, and for Chelsea, it\u2019s good for him to have a rest in his mind. Not least because there\u2019s also a beautiful European Championships coming up for him. So we have to try and get him a bit more focused or relaxed to get him into the next phase.\u201d Chelsea do not expect the Belgium manager, Marc Wilmots, to rest Hazard for the forthcoming international window, when the national team take on Portugal in Brussels on 29 March. The player may begin on the bench when Chelsea meet Everton in the FA Cup quarter-final at Goodison Park on Saturday, with Hiddink confident he can return to form. \u201cEveryone who has this big potential and talent will have this experience,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen one player has this dip he is usually raised by the rest of the performance of the team. But we had a difficult time up to December so that didn\u2019t help him.\u201d John Terry, who has been absent with a hamstring injury sustained in the thumping win against Newcastle last month, has travelled to Merseyside but is not expected to start the game. Costa is also a major doubt with his own hip problem sustained against PSG; either Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my or Bertrand Traor\u00e9 is likely to start as the team\u2019s lone forward. Hiddink suggested Alexandre Pato, who signed on a six-month loan from Corinthians at the end of January, may have effectively dropped to fifth-choice striker despite having not yet featured for the club. The Brazilian\u2019s involvement to date has been limited to twice being an unused substitute. Chelsea also have Radamel Falcao back in full training after a thigh injury, meaning five forwards are competing for a solitary place. \u201cFalcao is growing in terms of his fitness, increasing the intensity, and that is encouraging for him and us,\u201d Hiddink said. \u201cPato is the same. It\u2019s about competition. I want to have a fair judgement on the players in a striking position, which is now different to when Pato came in. \u201cAt that time we didn\u2019t have R\u00e9my or Falcao, either. We didn\u2019t know about Traor\u00e9, who has made an impact and developed quickly. So there is a kind of hierarchy as to who is knocking on the door as to who might replace Diego as first-choice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
