And, for a lot of retailers of sportswear, this is reflected in the way these clothes are marketed \u2013 right down to the faceless mannequins in stores. Not any more. Last week Nike proved its status as a disruptor when its London store introduced a female plus-size mannequin standing alongside a slender counterpart. The company introduced its plus-sized range back in 2017 but now shoppers of all body types can see the full and natural range that female bodies come in. The plus-size mannequins are being joined by mannequins with disabilities, another welcome addition to the generally exclusionary sportswear industry. Nike\u2019s mannequins have been well received by shoppers and on social media, where pictures of them went viral at the weekend. As is the nature of the internet though, other people have berated Nike for glamorising obesity, going so far as to say that the mannequin, were she real, would be diabetic and riddled with osteoarthritis. I\u2019m not sure where their outrage was when research showed that most high-street mannequins are so thin they wouldn\u2019t menstruate. When we are shown bigger bodies, the concern trolls are never far away. They don\u2019t come right out and say they are disgusted by squishy rolls of fat and bigger bottoms. Instead, they feign concern for the health and wellbeing of that person, based solely on their looks. Completely unsolicited, these people dish out advice or blame, under the guise of caring about their health. They\u2019re so prevalent, even being a plastic mannequin in a Nike store doesn\u2019t make you immune from them. There are two problems with this reaction to seeing bigger bodies. The first is that there is no way for any of us to look at the body of a larger person and make any rational or even accurate judgment about how their health is. There are a proportion of people who we might consider to be bigger who do not have the diseases that we commonly associate with obesity, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. That is, it is entirely possible to be fit and fat. But a quick glance at the rolls on someone\u2019s tummy won\u2019t tell you that. One of the biggest predictors of someone\u2019s health if they are in a larger body is not their fatness but rather their healthy habits. Physical fitness is one of the most important markers for health and may offset some of the negative effects that someone who has extra fat may be otherwise subject to. No matter how much you weigh, being active is important and needs to be encouraged. You cannot tell this just by looking at someone\u2019s body \u2013 and you could also argue that it\u2019s none of your business. If people were really serious about caring for the health of mannequins \u2013 or real-life people who are larger than society normally deems acceptable \u2013 you would understand the effect that comments can have. Stigma related to their size is actually likely to stop bigger people exercising. Shaming them doesn\u2019t translate into the health gains we pretend to be so desperately interested in. The backlash against an inanimate object \u2013 a shiny plastic mannequin \u2013 is just the tip of the iceberg in the war on obesity. Except there is no war on obesity; there is only a war on the people who inhabit bigger bodies. There is no denying that we should be healthy and that we should encourage healthy habits, but every time someone points out that anyone who is larger can\u2019t possibly be healthy, not only could they be wrong, they\u2019re actually making it harder for anyone who isn\u2019t able-bodied, cis-gendered or thin to achieve health, in mind and body. Looking at a bigger mannequin or even a bigger body will not make you fatBut berating and shaming bigger bodies, even if they are made of plastic, may make someone who doesn\u2019t look thin too embarrassed to enjoy moving his or her body. Nike should be applauded for its inclusive approach: it is good for our physical and mental health and throws down the gauntlet for other retailers to follow suit. There is everything to gain from this move, despite what the haters say. \u2022 Dr Nikki Stamp is a cardiothoracic surgeon"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
