Our readers get around. Within hours of looking through the paper, readers are enthusiastically planning their holidays and mailing us their questions. But this week there were very few travel queries in our inbox. A big black cloud had firmly settled over the world. We were in mourning. The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington had left us stunned, depressed and uncertain about our future. If the world looks on the brink of war at the most, or a recession at the least, how can we plan a holiday two, four or six months down the line? September is traditionally the peak booking month for ski and winter sun holidays. But what should you do? Surprisingly, nobody felt inclined to ask us last week. Many of us just wanted to curl up under the duvet and go back to sleep. Who wants to brave terrorism-ridden skies now? And who wants to be booking expensive holidays if they are about to lose their jobs? Keith Betton, spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents, said: 'Any drop-off in bookings in travel agents in the last week is probably because people are not in the mood to book holidays right now. 'You'll probably find that cinema and theatre bookings are down too. People were not in the mood for fun in the sun last week. But holidaymakers get over that emotional feeling quickly.' Especially when the weather starts getting grotty and there are bargains around. The Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office's travel advice unit says it has been inundated by calls from worried potential travellers to Cyprus and Egypt. Its advice is that it is still safe to travel to both, but the image of these holiday spots popping up on news maps gives us all the jitters. The Foreign Office is advising against travel to Afghanistan and Pakistan, and says travellers need to 'maintain a high level of vigilance' almost everywhere, given the heightened tension in the Middle East. If you are planning a holiday in the next six months, we paint a picture here of what to expect in terms of prices, availability and danger, if any. Late summer sun Steve Endacott, managing director of Holidays by Phone, reports that more late deals than usual are being offered to Greece, Turkey and Cyprus in October because people are holding back from booking. 'You can go to most Greek islands for \u00a399, including flights, accommodation and transfers,' he said. In times of political uncertainty travellers tend to stick to resorts 'that feel more English', he said. 'In the Gulf War people continued to go on holiday on short-haul flights and places close to home such as Spain. But people perceived Turkey, Greece and Cyprus as nearer to the conflict than Spain.' For travellers this means lots of bargains in these countries over the next couple of months, and fewer in the costas. Noel Josephides, managing director of Sunvil Holidays, which has a big programme of holidays to Greece and Cyprus, said: 'We are getting some advance bookings, but people will not make any decisions yet.' Skiing holidays If you plan to take a skiing holiday this winter, it may be worth holding out for one of the many last-minute bargains expected to abound, according to Endacott. This month is traditionally a peak booking month, but the US terrorist attacks have put people off. Providing you don't plan to ski in the February half-term or at Easter, it may be worth waiting for last-minute deals. Holidays in continental Europe are expected to be booked more quickly than those to the US. Whatever their price, American ski trips are not expected to sell at all, according to Ed Button of North America Travel Service. Winter sun The winter sun map for this season has been turned upside down overnight. Interest in many of this year's newly 'hot' destinations has gone stone cold. Oman - being billed as 'the new Dubai' - no longer looks such an exciting prospect with the US building up its military presence in the Gulf. Suddenly we seem to be returning to the traditional, safe bets: the Caribbean (provided it's a direct flight rather than one via the US) and the Canary Islands. There had been hopes just a few weeks ago that the Canaries, which can be reached in as little as three and a half hours, was going to become the 'in' weekend break destination now that BA is offering scheduled flights there (as opposed to the rigid seven-night-stay charters). But now even those Canaries quickies look less likely to be a hit because of tighter airport security. If checking in and out takes longer, some people may be deterred from just going for a weekend and stick to UK hotels with indoor pools and spas. Cyprus is likely to be offered very cheaply this winter. British forces are based there, but the island is unlikely be the scene of military action. Mike Theodoulou, a correspondent based there, said: 'Tourism took a big hit here in the run-up to the Gulf War. Cyprus was well away from the action, but foreign TV stations often showed it under a cloud of projected Iraqi nerve gas when showing how far Saddam Hussein was capable of hitting with his Scud missiles. 'If the US hits just Afghanistan, it probably won't have much of an impact on Cyprus. Even so people don't like travelling somewhere so close to the Middle East at times of instability.' Packages to Florida will be cheaper than for years. Low-cost airlines Predictions that low-cost airlines such as Buzz, Go, EasyJet and Ryanair will be forced to put up their prices in the next few months may be unfounded. But the fares could eventually climb if any of them goes out of business. This would reduce competition and the pressure to offer bargains. These companies are sensitive to the crisis because of the fear of flying and the higher costs of fuel and insurance. Worries that extra security checks would mean planes take longer to turn around at airports and spend less time in the air making money are not as severe as feared so far. These airlines report that aircraft are generally taking off punctually and are not taking longer to turn around. But they admit passengers are spending more of their own time checking in - which may deter many people from bothering with weekend trips. The airlines fly to domestic and mainland European cities which are not as severely affected by recent events as transatlantic flights, whose numbers are being cut. EasyJet is predicting masses of bargains on low-cost airlines between now and Christmas as carriers discount to encourage people to travel again. Toby Nicol, its spokesman, said: 'Between now and the New Year, Go is advertising cheap fares and so is Ryanair. And we are about to launch a big sale. Now is the time to take that weekend break you have always promised yourself to Barcelona.' Airport security in Europe is far tighter than in the US. 'We have more experience of terrorism here,' said EasyJet. Across the Atlantic sloppiness persists despite the attacks, according to reports in several American papers. A Northwest Airlines crew were allowed through airport security in Phoenix, Arizona, carrying a pocket knife and a corkscrew, and a radio reporter was allowed on a plane with a bag of radio equipment looking which he said 'looked uncomfortably like a bomb-maker's kit'. All the main American airlines are cutting jobs and services because of a slump in passenger numbers. Many flight attendants are still too scared to go back to work following the hijackings. The Middle East If you've ever fancied luxuriating in a five-star hotel for the price of a cheap Spanish package, this winter may be the time to do it. The Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh - just four and a half hours away by air - is full of five-star hotels built over the past decade with Egyptian government subsidies. The big chains such are here in full force. Hyatt, Ritz-Carlton, Hilton and Club Med offer attentive service. Sun is guaranteed - it hasn't rained since the mid-Nineties - and the resort is just a four-and-a-half hour flight away. The only drawbacks may be the high price of alcohol and the worry of being in a Mus lim country at a time of tension. But companies offering holidays to Egypt say tourism is the country's lifeblood and it is unlikely to give visitors a frosty welcome. Philip Hamilton-Grierson of Cox &amp;Kings said: 'We have no evidence of tourists being treated badly in the Middle East [ see our report on Uzbekistan on page 9 ]. Most of the Islamic world recognises the horrors of what happened in the US. We cannot tar a whole region with the same brush.' Egypt specialist Longwood Holidays says discounting has not broken out yet. But industry experts predict prices will be slashed to the desperate levels seen after the Luxor tourist massacre in November 1998. Travelbag Adventures' managing director Mark Wright also thinks tourists are unlikely to be picked on in Muslim countries: 'The Middle East has a big tourism industry and most people will not want to destroy that.' The firm has launched its first family adventure brochure including escorted tours to Egypt, Morocco and Jordan. Wright said: 'On Wednesday afternoon after the terrorist attacks, we took three more Family Adventures bookings for Egypt. It just shows the wide range of opinion on security among the travelling public.' Noel Josephides of Sunvil, which offers holidays to Lebanon, said: 'Unless there is a backlash against Westerners the Middle East is the place to go. It's a catastrophe for them if tourists stop coming. Pricewise, they will take any price you offer .' Australasia, the Far East and the Indian Ocean Holidays in the Far East, Australia and New Zealand will be cheaper in the short term as airlines encourage people to travel again with special deals, said Dave Simmons, managing director of Quest Travel. In the longer term prices are likely to rise as extra security costs feed into fares. Internal flights in Australia and New Zealand have increased in price due to the collapse of the regional airline Ansett, which has reduced both competition and the number of domestic flights in Australia. Flights to these regions are likely to take slightly longer as aircraft are re-routed away from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Sue Biggs of Kuoni Travel said Mauritius and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean are the firm's best-selling destinations. 'It's not a potential target of conflict and people feel safe on beach-only holidays,' she said. Good deals will be around this winter to encourage people to keep travelling there. South Africa This is the latest hip destination and should be busy with tourism over the next few months. Airlines such as Virgin are already redeploying aircraft to meet big demand and a shortage of flights. Fares may go up slightly due to security costs and high demand. The UK Forget foot and mouth. Lots of us are expected to rush back to the UK countryside. If getting through airports for a weekend away is going to take longer, many people may jump in the car, curl up in front of a log fire and look forward to morning fry-ups. Mike Bevan, owner of Linthwaite House Hotel on Lake Windermere, has already received lots of new weekend bookings for the next few months. 'We expect to be much more booked up. There is pent-up demand for the lakes.' He said many hotels in the Lake District had suffered big losses because of foot and mouth, but discounts were unlikely as their popularity grew. Our advice: book your UK short weekend break soon before things get too booked up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
