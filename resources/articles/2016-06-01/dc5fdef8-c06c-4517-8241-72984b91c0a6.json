With just a fortnight to go before the historic referendum that will decide whether Britain remains a member of the European Union, Johnson was accused on Thursday night of misleading the public and putting his own career before the good of the country \u2013 including by his Conservative colleague energy secretary Amber Rudd. The Scottish first minister described it as a \u201cscandal\u201d that Johnson\u2019s Vote Leave campaign bus still has the controversial claim that Britain sends \u00a3350m a week to Brussels emblazoned on the side of it. The figure has been called \u201cpotentially misleading\u201d by the independent Statistics Authority, for failing to take into account the UK\u2019s rebate from the EU. Sturgeon accused Johnson \u2013 who repeatedly defended the number during the debate \u2013 as \u201cdriving around the country in a bus with a giant whopper painted on the side\u201d. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle, also making the case for remain, joined Sturgeon and Rudd on the attack, in another of the extraordinary combinations that have characterised the referendum campaign. At one point Eagle jabbed her finger at Johnson, saying, \u201cget that lie off your bus!\u201d. Rudd, who is regarded by some in her party as a potential future leader, also gave a punchy performance, describing Johnson as, \u201cthe life and soul of the party, but not the man you want driving you home at the end of the evening\u201d. She also suggested he was keener on furthering his own career than standing by his principles. \u201cWe need to look at the numbers \u2013 I fear the only number Boris is interested in is the one that says No 10\u201d. However, the former mayor of London appeared unruffled by the attacks on his character, and stuck to the line that a vote to leave would \u201ctake back control of our democracy\u201d \u2013 a sentiment that was warmly received by the studio audience. At one point during Thursday night\u2019s debate, the former mayor of London urged the opposing panellists not to \u201creduce this argument to a lot of personal stuff\u201d \u2013 and he was applauded by the audience when he hit back at Sturgeon, accusing her of being \u201cmore keen on being ruled from Brussels than ruled from Westminster\u201d. With Johnson widely regarded as the leave campaign\u2019s strongest advocate, and the polls suggesting the result on 23 June will be too close to call, the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, being coordinated from Downing Street, is keen to ramp up the pressure on him. Stronger In will be unveiling a deliberately provocative poster on Friday morning, picturing Johnson gambling in a casino alongside the justice secretary Michael Gove, and with Ukip leader Nigel Farage, clutching a cigar. Sturgeon offered a strong defence of immigration, saying the free movement of people that is a fundamental principle of the EU single market is a \u201ctwo-way street\u201d, which benefits UK citizens who can travel abroad, as well as EU migrants who can come to the UK and work. \u201cImmigration is causing pressure in some areas, Sturgeon said. \u201cBut the answer to that is to invest in our public services. If you are struggling to access public services, blame the politicians not the immigrants.\u201d She added: \u201cThe impact of austerity on our public services is much greater than the impact of immigration.\u201d And while Vote Leave has repeatedly claimed that exiting the EU would free up more resources to spend on public services including the NHS, Sturgeon said she \u201cwouldn\u2019t trust Boris Johnson with the NHS any further than I could throw Boris Johnson\u201d, and said he wasn\u2019t interested in protecting Britain\u2019s workers, but only in seizing \u201cDavid Cameron\u2019s job\u201d. Rudd insisted that tackling immigration was a \u201ccomplex issue\u201d, for which there was no \u201csilver bullet\u201d \u2013 but that leaving the EU would hit the economy. Eagle, the shadow business secretary, also hinted at her own leadership ambitions, when Johnson asked whether she could be the first woman leader of the Labour party, warning him to, \u201cbeware of the blonde bombshell\u201d. The overwhelming majority of Labour MPs support remaining in the EU, but outspoken backbencher John Mann announced on Thursday night that he would back Brexit. In an open letter to the Sun newspaper, Mann said Labour is \u201cgoing to get a big shock across the country,\u201d when the referendum result comes in on 24 June Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary \u2013 who was spinning for Vote Leave, told the Guardian he believed the attacks on Johnson during the TV debate were carefully scripted. \u201cTonight I thought was stark,\u201d he said. \u201cThe remain side came on with the usual old scare stories about Britain not being good enough but what really added to that, was lacing its way through that, was just personal abuse. One after another. You could see their heads dip down to read the line: \u2018Now time to abuse Boris Johnson\u2019.\u201d In his closing statement, Johnson accused the remain camp of scaremongering, by repeatedly highlighting the risks of leaving the EU. \u201cThe last couple of hours and the whole campaign is the contrast between this side offering hope and that side offering nothing but fear about life outside,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say we can\u2019t do it on our own. We say we are a great country. We say we can. They say we have absolutely no choice but to stay locked in the back of the EU car driven in the wrong direction, driven in a destination we do not want to go.\u201d Andrea Leadsom, a Conservative who was participating for leave, received a warm response when she described Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU as \u201ca takeover by an unelected superstate\u201d. A junior minister in the department for energy and climate change, Leadsom also had a spiky exchange with Rudd, her boss, who criticised her tone on immigration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
