The high court has dismissed an appeal by the man, who can only be referred to as CD. It said his removal to an undisclosed address \"in a Midlands city\" was necessary to protect the public from the \"immediate and real\" risk of a terrorist related-attack. The move comes in advance of the publication on Monday by May of the legislation to replace control orders with new counter-terror powers that will ban the use of such \"internal exile\" powers and restrict the use of 16-hour curfews. Lawyers for the Home Office said that the forced relocation of CD was necessary to prevent covert meetings with two of his associates referred to as MS and TM to develop their attack plans. Lisa Giovannetti QC, for the home secretary, said the suspect had made several attempts to buy guns from seven north London-based criminal associates since he returned from training in Syria in April 2009. He had also shown a \"high level of security awareness\". He had reportedly attended the Cumbria training camp organised by Muhammed Hamid at Baysbrown Farm in 2004. The 21 July attempted bombers had attended the same camp. Mr Justice Simon said that the family of CD, who holds dual British and Nigerian nationality and is married with two children, were entitled to a travel allowance to visit him. The home secretary imposed the 12-month control order, which included the ban on living in London, on CD in February this year. He had voluntarily moved to an address outside the capital but was still free to return to London whenever he wished. The failure of his appeal comes days before the government is due to publish its legislation replacing control orders with its terrorist prevention and investigation measures, TPIM, which is expected to end the use of forced relocation in Britain. Corinna Ferguson, legal officer at the human rights campaign, Liberty, said: \"As the government prepares to introduce 'control-orders lite', another case demonstrates the absurdity of this punishment without trial.\" \"If there are such clear allegations that someone has been training for terrorism, attempting to procure arms and meeting with co-conspirators to plan atrocities, he really must be charged and tried. Shuffling him between addresses around the country provides neither certainty for his family nor safety to the public.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
