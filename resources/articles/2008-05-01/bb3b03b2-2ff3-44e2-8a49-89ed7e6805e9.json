Supporters will only need to provide a match ticket, passport and completed immigration card to enter the country under the temporary rules. The decision, which had been expected for several days, followed protracted negotiations between Russian and British diplomats, Uefa officials, and envoys from the two clubs that have reached the final, Manchester United and Chelsea. There had been concern that Russia would not cope with the surge in visa requests from British fans hoping to watch the May 21 final. The ongoing diplomatic tension between the UK and Russia was understood to have undermined attempts to secure the \"visa-free\" deal. Russian officials were believed to be angry at visa restrictions imposed on their own nationals entering Britain, and the dispute had threatened to hamper negotiations. The special visa exemptions will only apply between May 19 and 23. Anyone overstaying the 72-hour entry period will have to pay the fee for a regular visa when leaving the country, officials said. Announcing what Uefa called a \"historical decision\", the association's president, Michel Platini, praised Russian authorities for their \"exceptional and unprecedented\" concession. \"This is great news for football fans travelling to watch this year's Uefa Champions League final in Moscow,\" he said. \"Our job is to make sure that they are able to get to and from Moscow as easily as possible. \"I am therefore extremely pleased that at my request, all fans travelling with a valid match ticket can use this to enter Russian territory, and for this I must thank wholeheartedly the president of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, the Russian government, the city of Moscow and the Football Union of Russia for this exceptional and unprecedented gesture.\" Russian's foreign ministry said it was dispatching six extra employees to the Russian embassy's consular department to deal with the flood of visa applications. Last night the head of the Russian Champions League final committee, Alexei Sorokin, said Moscow airports had already received more than 120 applications from airlines wanting to bring British fans to Moscow. He said the majority of fans - around 30,000 - are expected to arrive in Moscow on the match day. He said rival fans would be kept apart before they reach the Luzhniki stadium: \"The fans will land at different airports.\" Some 600 coaches have been drafted in to take the fans to central Moscow. However, the announcement may not be welcome news for all fans. There have been complaints about the cost of travelling to and staying in Moscow. Many supporters are already believed to have spent between \u00a3100 and \u00a3250 to secure visas for their trip. Jon Keen, deputy chairman of the Football Supporters' Federation, said: \"Obviously it's good news. But why has this taken so long to come about when the decision to have the final in Moscow was taken years ago?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
