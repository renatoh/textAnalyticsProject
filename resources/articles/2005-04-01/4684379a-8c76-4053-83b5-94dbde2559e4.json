The teams are facing each other at the Stadio delle Alpi, in Turin tomorrow in the second leg of the quarter final. Messages posted on the internet have warned of violence as feelings run high in advance of the 20th anniversary of the Heysel stadium disaster. Thirty nine fans, mainly Italians, died after a wall collapsed during rioting at the stadium in Brussels during the 1985 European cup final. For the first time since the disaster, the teams met last week at Liverpool's Anfield stadium for the first leg of the tie. The match went ahead without trouble, but some Juventus fans turned their backs at a banner promoting friendship between the clubs. Merseyside police said: \"We have issued a stern warning to anyone thinking of travelling to the game to cause trouble, 'Don't Bother'.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
