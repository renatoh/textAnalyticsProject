An annual survey by reed.co.uk shows that number of hours lost through late arrival has risen by a third since 2002. According to the survey, 17% of workers lose one hour of working time per week due to transport problems. This makes for a total of 11m lost hours, and even if we make the very generous assumption that all those delayed earn only the average national salary, we can estimate that the cost adds up to some\u00a37.7 bn. And presumably the journey home is no better and 17% of workers are losing an hour a week of their own time, in uncomfortable and overcrowded conditions. Whether this is costing anyone anything financially is not known, but it certainly adds to the unpleasantness of life. As usual, the results are worse in London where are third of workers are regularly late for work twice a week. This lost time is piled on top of what are by far and away the longest commutes in the country; a substantial number of London workers spend three hours of their working day just getting to and from the office. Transport is also having an influence on that perennially popular topic of conversation, house prices. A separate survey from reed.co.uk found that one in three workers have considered moving house to make their journey into work easier. These are by no means idle dreams. In spite of the fact that moving house is much harder work and far more stressful than changing jobs, the same survey found that one in 10 workers had acted on the fantasy and actually moved. In fact, rather than dreaming of shifting down and cashing in, one in six workers say they would happily pay 15% more than market rate for a house which gave them an easier commute. In London, that 15% would work out at about \u00a340,000, provided you could afford it. And with City bonuses warming up again, some can. For the rest us of us, elections come and go, but make little difference to the private affluence and public squalor which can be seen daily, during just about any commute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
