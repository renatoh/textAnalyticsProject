Bush's scheduled endorsement at a campaign event in Houston, Texas, is one of the biggest names yet for Romney, further consolidating his status as the establishment candidate. The endorsement of George Bush Sr comes in spite of his wife, Barbara, recently dismissing the 2012 campaign as \"the worst campaign I've ever seen in my life.\" Although Bush months ago signalled his support for Romney, it is helpful publicity for Romney in a quiet week without any primaries or caucuses for the two to be pictured together. The senior Bush's presidency turned sour at the end, with Republicans unhappy over a U-turn on raising taxes, but his reputation has improved in recent years. His decision after the Gulf war not to push on to Baghdad is now lauded as wise in some quarters after the debacle of the 2003 Iraq invasion. His backing comes just a week after Romney received the endorsement of Bush's son Jeb, a former governor of Florida. Former president George W. Bush has said he will not be endorsing anyone. Although his former boss is holding back, a senior member of the younger Bush's administration, John Bolton is to campaign for Romney in Baltimore on Sunday ahead of Maryland's primary. Bolton, a foreign policy hawk and former US ambassador to the UN, announced in January he was endorsing Romney. In recent days, Romney has picked up endorsements from: Mike Lee, a Utah senator who was elected with the support of the Tea Party; Kevin McCarthy, the majority whip and the third most senior Republican in the House; and Al Cardenas, head of the American Conservative Union. They called on the party to unite behind Romney and for the three remaining candidates to quit the race. Romney has 103 major endorsements: 13 governors, 17 senators and 73 members of the House. The governors range across the Republican spectrum: the right-winger Jan Brewer of Arizona; the moderate Chris Christie from New Jersey; former Tea Party favourite Nikki Haley of South Carolina; and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. Senators include the 2008 White House candidate John McCain. On top of this, Romney has the backing of hundreds of Republicans from state legislatures, party officials and newspapers across the country. Competitor Rick Santorum, by contrast, has only a modest collection of endorsements. In spite of having served in the Senate, no senators are backing him, and he has just six supporters in the House. The Alabama governor, Robert Bentley, said he voted for Santorum in the state's primary this month. Newt Gingrich has the support of two governors and 11 House members. Ron Paul has a senator \u2014 his son Rand \u2014 and three House members. Among endorsements still being sought, the most prized include: Florida senator Marco Rubio, who has the backing of the Tea Party and could help win over some Latino voters; former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who has been voicing support for Gingrich; and Mike Huckabee, who ran in 2008 and is popular with Christian evangelicals and other social conservatives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
