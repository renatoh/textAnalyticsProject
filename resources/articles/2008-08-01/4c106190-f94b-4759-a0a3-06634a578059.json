The problem with a stage show like Dad's Army, an ensemble comedy, is that you would spend a lot of the time sitting there thinking: 'OK, so that's not John Le Mesurier and that's not Bill Pertwee.' Porridge was written for the late Ronnie Barker and so, in theory, it should work only with him. He gave it great spontaneity, which most British actors can't do. His Fletcher bore no resemblance to the Barker you would see on The Two Ronnies wearing the big glasses. Yet Rising Damp was also written for Barker and it worked brilliantly with Leonard Rossiter when Barker wouldn't do it. Some of the great shows, like Rising Damp, started out as one-off plays. If they do Porridge on stage, they shouldn't cast some large actor doing his version of Ronnie Barker. With Dad's Army, I would have said you should have ideally cast Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Bob Hoskins. It needs that calibre of star to compete with the past. When you are playing Frazer, the John Laurie role, you are playing a part that is the culmination of all the Scotsmen in comedy over the past 50 years. That was the genius of Dad's Army. \u00b7 David Quantick has written for many comedy shows, including Brass Eye. He contributes regularly to Radio 4 and Grumpy Old Men."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
