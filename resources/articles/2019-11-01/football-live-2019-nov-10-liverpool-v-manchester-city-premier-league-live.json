Thanks for being here, for what turned into an absolute cracker, and potentially a season-defining one. Here\u2019s the match report again. Bye! J\u00fcrgen Klopp finally turns up. He says he didn\u2019t see the penalty incident and still hasn\u2019t, which is handy. Meanwhile: We saw in the last 10, 15 minutes, the goal gave City momentum. In that moment, they controlled the game. The other 75 minutes, we controlled the game with our intensity. If that was easy I think a lot more teams would try it. The boys put another incredible shift in. Then you need to score goals in the right moment, and obviously that\u2019s what we did. All three goals were incredible. Then you have to defend with all you have, and that\u2019s what we did. I don\u2019t know a lot of ways to beat City but if we want to do it we need to do it with intensity, forcing them to play our game if you like. We\u2019re yet to hear from J\u00fcrgen Klopp, but here\u2019s a bit of Jordan Henderson: We knew it was a big game. City are a fantastic team. We knew the importance of the game and wanted to put on a good performance and win the game. There\u2019s still so long to go, so our first mistake would be to look at the gap. For us it\u2019s irrelevant. For us it\u2019s about keep winning, keep the momentum going. Here\u2019s David Hytner\u2019s match report: There had been little more than millimetres in it during the previous two meetings of English football\u2019s current powerhouses. Remember John Stones\u2019s goalline clearance for Manchester City at the Etihad last January in his team\u2019s 2-1 Premier League win or when Kyle Walker did the same at the very end of the Community Shield at the beginning of this season? City would squeak to victory that day on penalties. Liverpool authored a different story here, one underpinned by ruthless finishing and which came to be coloured by comfort. Much more here: Pep Guardiola discusses the game. We showed why we are the champions today. The way we played was incredible. I\u2019m so proud of my team, more than ever. I\u2019m so proud, we played so good. Please ask the referees [about the Alexander-Arnold handball], please don\u2019t ask to me. Asky to Mike Riley, and the guys in the VAR. I would like to talk about my performance, it was so good. The way we played, with the problems we have, in the squad, it was awesome. One of the best performances we have played. We play in the way, the reason why we are back-to-back champions. That is the point. If in the end Liverpool win, I will be the first to congratulate them, because we cannot deny how good they are. The way they play, how they create their chances, and this personality to play all the time. So yeah, it was good. Their first two shots were two goals, and it is difficult. We lost because they scored three goals and we scored one. That was an absolutely cracking match. Full-blooded, high-paced entertainment from first to last, packed with quality; an absolute neutral-thriller. That penalty call was obviously important, and had City scored the first goal everything might have been different, though it wouldn\u2019t have made their defence any less dodgy. \u201cWe know if we keep getting 97 points one year we\u2019re going to win the league,\u201d Robertson adds. Robertson discusses the game: \u201cIt\u2019s a massive win,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think we started the best, and I think the first goal was always going to be an important factor then [after half-time] we knew the next goal was crucial.\u201d So, in short, goals help. Back to that not-penalty, for a moment. \u201cIf the ref has to disallow any goal where the ball hits an attacking hand in the build up,\u201d wrrites Richard Beniston, \u201cthen presumably (given the little-mentioned Silva handball preceding Alexander-Arnold\u2019s) the right course of action would be to give the penalty against Liverpool, see if City score it and if so then immediately disallow it.\u201d I would love to see this happen. Pep Guardiola strides across the pitch, heading towards the referee, and Sky\u2019s cameras keep on him as he does it. What will happen when he gets there? Will he start swinging punches? Will he go full hairdryer? Neither: a handshake and an exaggerated thankyou, and he\u2019s off again. 90+5 mins: It\u2019s all over! Liverpool are eight points clear at the top, Manchester City are fourth! 90+3 mins: City chipping balls hopefully into the Liverpool area, Liverpool hacking the ball back out again. 90+1 mins: From the free kick Jesus heads over, though he was offside anyway. We\u2019re into stoppage time, of which there will be about four minutes. 89 mins: Liverpool have completely lost their swagger, but they\u2019ve still got their lead. A blind pass gives the ball back to City, Sterling wins a free kick and then has a bit of a row with Gomez. 87 mins: Salah goes off and Joe Gomez comes on, presumably to shore up the right side of Liverpool\u2019s defence. 86 mins: Chance for another! Angelino crosses from the left, and Walker appears from nowhere to win the header at the far post, but it goes over! 83 mins: Sterling sidefoots the ball straight into Alexander-Arnold\u2019s hand. No penalty, under any circumstances, but Guardiola loses his rag anyway. 83 mins: There\u2019s anxiety in the air, and Sterling is terrorising Alexander-Arnold down the City left. 81 mins: Incidentally, immediately after the goal Liverpool replaced Firmino with Oxlade-Chamberlain. 80 mins: Nearly another! De Bruyne\u2019s lovely backheeled pass sends Sterling sprinting into the area, but instead of chipping over Alisson and into the net he nudges inside towards Jesus, and it\u2019s intercepted. 79 mins: Klopp is absolutely furious about the goal, presumably because De Bruyne may have fouled Fabinho in the buid-up. It survives the VAR check, though, and it\u2019s game on! Well, ish. Angelino\u2019s low cross deflects to Bernardo Silva, whose low shot clips the inside of the post on its way in! 78 mins: Angelino ghosts past Alexander-Arnold very nicely, and tees up Gundogan for a shot he\u2019s too demoralised to take. He instead gives it to Sterling, whose shot is blocked. 75 mins: Sterling cuts in from the left, Mane gets a foot in and diverts the ball towards his own goal. It\u2019s certainly not a deliberate back-pass but Alisson decides he can\u2019t pick it up, and instead panics and concedes a corner. 73 mins: Another Alexander-Arnold crossfield pass to Robertson, and Stones has to slide to cut out his his pass to Milner. Liverpool get, and waste, a corner. 71 mins: City make their first change, hauling off Aguero and replacing him with Jesus. 68 mins: Aguero must score! But he doesn\u2019t even touch it! De Bruyne\u2019s pass is lovely, the Argentinian runs onto it, he sticks out a right foot to turn it in, and ... doesn\u2019t! 67 mins: Now Alexander-Arnold bursts down the left, keeps going into the penalty area, and then goes down. No penalty there either. 66 mins: Sterling goes down in the area. The referee tells him to get up, and books Rodri for arguing. It looks to me like Mane, having been beaten for pace by the England forward, did put a forearm against his back. Goes in the \u201cseen \u2019em given\u201d column. 64 mins: This game is cooked. Liverpool are hogging the ball and looking threatening, with Salah visibly desperate for more goals. 63 mins: Fabinho finds himself in a pocket of space. Shooooot! Screams the crowd. His shot is blocked. 61 mins: Jordan Henderson comes off, presumably so he can have more time to endlessly replay that cross and/or backheel flick in his imagination. Milner is on. 60 mins: Henderson executes a showy backheel flicked pass to Mane. 59 mins: I find De Bruyne\u2019s facial hair extremely unconvincing. Not as unconvincing as the City defence, but not far off. 57 mins: Liverpool are purring now, whenever they have the ball. They like a kitten toying with a half-dead mouse. 54 mins: Sterling cuts in from the left, feints to shoot, feints again, cuts in a bit more, feints to shoot again, eventually decides he should probably actually shoot, and then has a shot that deflects wide. 53 mins: More dodgy defending down the left from City there, mind. Henderson picked up the ball 20 yards from the byline, and just ran in a straight line. Gundogan kept up with him for a while but then gave up, leaving Angelino, who had presumably decided that Gundogan had this under control, behind the play and helpless. Liverpool score a third! It\u2019s a gorgeous Henderson cross, and Mane stoops to head in at the back stick! Bravo gets two hands to it, but can only fumble it in! 48 mins: On Sky, Geoff Shreeves says he was surrounded at half-time by City coaches, demanding to know why they hadn\u2019t been given a penalty. Hopefully they aren\u2019t totally distracted by vengeful frustration, because they could certainly still score a couple of goals here. 46 mins: They\u2019re off! The Premier League has released a statement about the handball incident: The VAR checked the penalty appeal for handball against Trent Alexander-Arnold and confirmed the on-field decision that it did not meet the considerations for a deliberate handball. So there you go. Now, on with the game: both sides are back on the field and ready for action. Sky\u2019s punditry panel of Roy Keane, Graeme Souness, Jose Mourinho and Vincent Kompany all think that Alexander-Arnold handballed and City should have had a penalty. \u201cIf there was no VAR I highly doubt that the hand ball would of been called, nor would the offside against Salah been whistled. In other words, it would still be two-nil,\u201d says Mary Waltz. This is clearly true. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s left-footed crossfield pass to Robertson in the build-up to Liverpool\u2019s second can also go on the wall, incidentally. Simon Yates has had a good think about that handball call: \u201cComing to this a bit late, but isn\u2019t the TAA handball exactly the situation which we were worrying about when the rules were tweaked?\u201d he writes. \u201cIf the ball hits the hand of a member of the attacking side in the move leading to a goal, the goal is now supposed to be disallowed for handball regardless of intent etc. So on that basis you should disallow Fabinho\u2019s goal for TAA\u2019s handball. Even though the handball was in the Liverpool area. But having given handball you then have to give the penalty even though the handball doesn\u2019t meet the criteria for a penalty, where you don\u2019t give it if the arm isn\u2019t in an unnatural position.\u201d Well this is confusing. I think the Alexander-Arnold handball didn\u2019t happen close enough to the Fabinho shot in either time or space for today\u2019s crack refereeing unit to take it into account. The VAR team, incidentally, say the arm was not in an unnatural position, and the ball came at him too quickly. 45+3 mins: Peeeeep! City were hilariously dominant for 10 minutes or so, yet they somehow still managed to be two down in the 13th, mainly because this back four aren\u2019t much cop at defending. It\u2019s been a lot of fun. 45+2 mins: With four seconds of those two minutes remaining, Aguero has another shot, but it\u2019s weak and easily saved. 45+1 mins: Into first-half stoppage time, of which there\u2019ll be about two minutes. 45 mins: Bravo stops another one! This time it was Salah\u2019s curler from 20 yards, which was neither powerful enough nor precise enough to sneak into the corner. 43 mins: Incidentally we have now been shown a still from the build-up to the Salah goal with the requisite offside-demonstrating blue line, and it\u2019s all good. 42 mins: Aguero is played into the left side of Liverpool\u2019s penalty area, but his shot zips across goal and wide. 40 mins: Salah is released down the right an tries to skip inside Fernandinho, who takes the ball with a clean sliding challenge. But the Egyptian goes down hurt, and the physio is looking at his foot/ankle area again. 38 mins: Bravo saves a shot! It\u2019s Firmino\u2019s effort, stuck left-footed straight at him. Alexander-Arnold created the opportunity, after producing a touch to control Alisson\u2019s clearance that was so beautiful I want to frame it and hang it in my bedroom so it\u2019s the first thing I see every morning when I wake up and reminds me of beauty, poetry and the potential of humankind. 35 mins: Liverpool attack again. Salah runs free on the left this time; his cross towards Wijnaldum is headed to Firmino, who jinks into the area and then shoots high. 34 mins: They win a corner. Robertson takes, and Lovren glances it across goal and wide. 33 mins: Sky\u2019s commentary team is laying into Angelino, as Liverpool attack down the right again. 29 mins: City hit the post! It\u2019s Angelino, who bumbles through the area and has a rubbish shot, which deflects off Van Dijk\u2019s shin and becomes much better, but still doesn\u2019t go in. Corner. \u201cHave we had one of those VAR photos yet with zig zag lines confirming Salah onside for the second goal?\u201d wonders Adam. We have not, just a rushed freeze-frame in which Salah looked suspiciously offside-ish to me. I\u2019m sure he was actually onside though, because the only alternative is that everything is broken and rotten and ruined. 27 mins: City\u2019s defence is bearing gifts. They half-clear the ball straight to Salah, standing all alone on the edge of the area, but then he passes to Firmino and the ball is nicked away. 25 mins: Save! Aguero does some fine work to not only keep the ball in a crowded area but somehow fashion space for a shot, but it\u2019s all for nought because Alisson saves it. 23 mins: Fabinho trips Gundogan, and somehow gets away without a booking. Just so City fans know where to direct their hate mail, the VAR today is Paul Tierney, with the assistant VAR Constantine Hatzidakis. Also, don\u2019t send hate mail. Play nice. 21 mins: Liverpool threaten again, but Wijnaldum\u2019s ball into the area is cleared for a corner, which it also cleared. 18 mins: Liverpool pass the ball around their defence for a while. \u201cWhether the handball should have led to a penalty or not, if I were a City fan, I\u2019d be furious with Ag\u00fcero,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cPlay to the whistle. Always play to the whistle. The ball fell almost to his feet, but he was too busy screaming at the ref and and allowed Van Dijk to simply step away from him. Basics. Inexcusable.\u201d 16 mins: The penalty call continues to cause controversy. \u201cThis is a distinctly uncharitable theory, but could this last VARce be down to an unwillingness to rule out such a truly stonking hit to call a penalty at the other end?\u201d wonders Matt Richman. \u201cYou would fear for Michael Oliver if that was the case.\u201d The way the ball struck Alexander-Arnold was extremely penaltyesque, but I just don\u2019t think you can win a penalty by punching the ball into a defender\u2019s arm, however accidental the attacker\u2019s punch might have been. 14 mins: He was onside! Liverpool are two goals up, and City are attacking beautifully but not defending at all. They\u2019ve only gone and stolen a second! Robertson\u2019s cross is a beauty, and it bounces to Salah, who heads it in! But was he onside? 11 mins: Bernardo Silva gets another cheap free-kick, just outside Liverpool\u2019s penalty area. This time Aguero nearly gets a touch at the near post, Stones nearly gets one at the far post, but the ball bounces out for a goal kick. City are owning this match, but not the scoreline. 9 mins: Then City win a free-kick on the left - Alexander-Arnold again - from which Sterling heads wide from the corner of the six-yard box! 8 mins: The ball bounced into Alexander-Arnold\u2019s arm off Bernardo Silva\u2019s arm. In those particular circumstances, the two handballs cancel each other out and the referee has to play on. I think that\u2019s right, no? 7 mins: There\u2019s the inevitable VAR delay as the handball decision is checked, but the goal stands! 6 mins: City think they should have had a penalty for handball, after the ball flicked off Alexander-Arnold\u2019s thigh and into his arm. The referee waves play on and Liverpool raid down the left. Mane\u2019s low cross is poked clear, but Fabinho runs onto it, takes a touch and blasts it inside the post from 25 yards! Cowabunga! They\u2019ve had a kick now, sure enough! 5 mins: Stone heads the corner on, but it goes wide. Liverpool really need to keep the ball for 30 seconds ago and hope they start purring. 4 mins: Now the visitors go down the right again, where Bernardo Silva goes shopping at the foulmart and buys a free kick from Robertson. It\u2019s cleared, but City have a corner. 3 mins: City go down the left this time, where Sterling fouls Alexander-Arnold. Liverpool have literally not kicked the ball yet, so here\u2019s there chance. 2 mins: The entire game so far has been played in the far right corner, as City attack. They pumped the ball up there from kick-off and Liverpool haven\u2019t been able to get rid of it. City now have a corner. 1 min: Peeeeeeep! Manchester City get us going! All preambles and precursors have been completed. Prepare for kick-off, because it\u2019s coming. \u201cWatching NBC buildup which consists entirely of adverts,\u201d writes Ian Copestake, as Anfield prepares for a minute\u2019s silence. \u201cSo far I have bought a pick-up truck and a year\u2019s supply of skin cleanser.\u201d And they\u2019re out! What\u2019s more, hands have been shaken, and anthems are being sung. There will presumably be some kind of Remembrance Sunday ceremony pre-match, so that\u2019s still to come. The players are in the tunnel! Kick-off is approaching at breakneck speed. \u201cI\u2019m in Stansted airport,\u201d says Alan McSherry. \u201cI\u2019m finding it hard to accept there\u2019s no place to watch this match airside? Is it true? If the Guardian says it, I\u2019ll know it\u2019s true.\u201d Thanks for your faith, Alan, but sadly I have no idea whatsoever. I once watched a match at Frankfurt airport, if that helps. Anyone? Jurgen Klopp talks with Sky: We\u2019ve played them so often, and it\u2019s always so difficult. But the key moments are, all chances we create we should score with, that would help massively. They will have their moments, 100%. Make sure we start good, stay good and finish good. And so does Virgil van Dijk: Well, it\u2019s pretty clear it\u2019s a massive game for both teams. We\u2019re all looking forward to it. We just have to go out there, enjoy it, give everything we\u2019ve got and have no regrets after. \u201cI didn\u2019t survive heart surgery this week to watch a damn draw,\u201d writes Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI feel amazingly, serenely confident in this match. Every intangible points to Liverpool and Pep is doing his thing (thanks Pep!) of sending out a scrambled line-up. Reds have this. Easily.\u201d Admirable confidence there. And congratulations on the survival business. Mo Salah called for the physio during the pre-match warm-up, to deal with some kind of foot-related issue. I\u2019ve heard nothing of a team change, so he is presumably fine: Pep Guardiola has a chat with Sky. He reveals that Rodri is in the team because he seemed fine in training (like, obviously), and that David Silva is on the bench because they didn\u2019t want to put both of them straight into the starting line-up after injury for such a significant game: Our plan? Try to win the game. Run when you don\u2019t have the ball and play when you have the ball. We\u2019ll try to do that. They\u2019re so strong. We know it. I\u2019ve said many times, after winning back to back Premier Leagues we needed to be pushed as well. They are going to help us for the next two, three, four years, help this club understand the level you have to achieve to be up there as long as possible. \u201cSurely this fixture can never live up to the hype but if it does ... gawd it would be beautiful,\u201d writes Mary Waltz. Here\u2019s hoping! Here\u2019s the PA Media take on the line-ups: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp went with his tried-and-tested big-game line-up for the visit of Manchester City. That meant four changes from the Champions League win over Genk with Andy Robertson returning at left-back, Jordan Henderson coming back into midfield and Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane rejoining the forward line. City made six changes as Claudio Bravo started in goal for the injured Ederson with three of the back four from Wednesday\u2019s Champions League draw against Atalanta altered. John Stones was picked to partner Fernandinho in the centre of defence with Kyle Walker and Angelino, who was making only his second Premier League start. Rodrigo came into midfield with Sergio Aguero preferred up front to Gabriel Jesus. Andy Hunter had a chat with Alisson this week. Here\u2019s his interview: Last season we had a great experience, an almost perfect season. We lost one game and that one game was against City. We know how big this game is for us. We know how big the game is for everyone \u2013 for them and for our fans. In the end it is just three more important points but Manchester City have been the best team in the league for the last few years so we need to give everything to win this game. We don\u2019t want to feel how we felt last season. Being second by just one point means we know that we need to give everything in every game if we want to become Premier League champions. We want it and we will try to do it. Much more here: So Ederson, as advertised, is missing and Claudio Bravo starts in his place behind a back four of Walker-Stones-Fernandinho-Angelino. Otherwise the teams look entirely surprise-free. The team news is in, and here are this afternoon\u2019s protagonists: Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, van Dijk, Robertson, Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Milner, Keita, Gomez, Adrian, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Origi. Man City: Bravo, Walker, Stones, Fernandinho, Jose Angelino, De Bruyne, Rodri, Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Gabriel Jesus, Silva, Mahrez, Joao Cancelo, Otamendi, Carson, Foden. Referee: Michael Oliver. And here are Pep Guardiola\u2019s: I\u2019ve never gone into a game feeling like an outsider or an underdog, thinking I am not going to win. I am not going to take the bus to Liverpool thinking I am going to lose the game. That has never happened in my career. Always I try to believe that, if we do the special things we plan to do, we will have our chance to win. Much more here: Here are Barney Ronay\u2019s pre-match thoughts: There is also something different in the texture of this injury-depleted City team. Guardiola loves midfielders, wants to turn the entire world a shade of midfielder, would ideally simply substitute the word \u201cmidfielder\u201d for the word footballer. Three months into the season this team has gone Full Midfielder. Seven City midfielders have scored a league goal. Eight City midfielders have started five league games or more, compared with three career defenders. Much more here: Manchester City\u2019s team coach has arrived at Anfield, where it was given a peaceful if not entirely friendly welcome: I have a lot of pre-match reading for you. Honestly, tell everyone in the room to go away for an hour or so, because you\u2019re going to be too busy staring at your phone/tablet/other device to interact in any meaningful way. First off: Mane-Firmino-Salah or Sterling-Aguero-whoever? That is the question: Hello world! And welcome to the first leg of this season\u2019s Premier League title play-off! Both teams will I\u2019m sure be looking forward to a bit of genuine competition, away from the 36 mildly glorified irritant friendlies which occupy the majority of their domestic attentions. Whoever wins this one will carry an advantage into the second leg, scheduled for the weekend of 4 April, though the nine-point deficit City will be lumbered with should they lose, coupled with Liverpool\u2019s ongoing refusal to be beaten by anyone under any circumstances, might make that one immaterial. While we wait for the teams here\u2019s a little trip down memory lane, at previous matches between these teams at Anfield since Pep Guardiola joined J\u00fcrgen Klopp in England: Last year\u2019s league game ended goalless, thanks to Riyad Mahrez\u2019s late penalty miss: The teams played at Anfield twice in 2017-18, with the first one ending City\u2019s run of 30 undefeated league games: And the second going a long way to ending their Champions League chances (it was the first leg, but nobody gives away a 3-0 first-leg advantage, except Barcelona obviously): And finally, on New Year\u2019s Eve 2016, Liverpool\u2019s win gave them renewed hope of catching the division\u2019s runaway leaders, Chelsea: And if that\u2019s not enough, have a bit of this:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
