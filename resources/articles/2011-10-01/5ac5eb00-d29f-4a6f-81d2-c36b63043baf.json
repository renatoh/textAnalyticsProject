Lewis is at his best when he's showing off his wit and lyrical dexterity. Cult Boyfriend sees him comparing his career with his date-worthiness \u2013 \"A cult boyfriend's like a record in a bargain bin/ No one knows its worth til a collector comes in\" \u2013 while When You're By Yourself touches on the important subject of whether to take your bag to the loo when you're eating alone. The fine line between cute and twee is ever present, however, and at times his tendency towards knowing self-assessment can grate. But he's certainly never boring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
