And one of Dell's most bitched about advantages is the low prices it pays Microsoft for Windows and Office. Microsoft has got the message, according to CRN, but it is not clear what it can do about it. Obviously Dell gets a volume discount -- most companies in most businesses offer volume discounts, so that's not an issue. The problem is that it is very tough to compete with Dell on volume. Last year, it shipped 20.7 million units, which (unless my arithmetic is wrong) is 40 per minute, 365 days a year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
