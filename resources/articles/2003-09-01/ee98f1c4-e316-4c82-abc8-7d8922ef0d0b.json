Most parents want clothes that work for children; the kids demand the lapdancers' gear and Beyonc\u00e9 bits that pass for junior playground chic. The impact of the tartification of childhood - the relentless sexualisation of the young and the determination of the market to hook them into money-making adolescence as soon as they toddle from the cradle - is now beginning to seep through even the toughest of parental fortifications. So what price the future of the unprotected? A decade ago Mr Justice Morland presided over the trial of Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, charged with the murder of two-year-old Jamie Bulger. He called for a fresh look at parenting and the dangers of children having unsupervised access to video 'nasties'. The media, picking up on his theme, fleetingly discussed the need for 'a new morality'. Last week Mr Justice Morland was in court again, and the new morality was still a mirage. This time it was to hear the trial of Rebecca Hodgson, 21, and Wayne Wood, 22. They were subsequently cleared of the manslaughter of 10-year-old Jade Slack though, on Friday, Wood was convicted of drug dealing and jailed for three-and-a-half years. The judge had ordered that the jury disregard as 'irrelevant' the fact that the couple waited 90 minutes before summoning help after Jade swallowed five ecstasy pills she found in a bedroom in Hodgson's home. The medical evidence revealed that Jade's temperature rose to 104F, her brain was swollen and she suffered a heart attack. It is obviously devastating to lose a child and perhaps the grief is further accentuated by the knowledge that an earlier intervention may have averted her death. Jade's parents, Beverley and Simon Slack, have talked of their 'little angel'. 'It's a nightmare and we never wake up from it,' Beverley said last week. Among the disturbing details which emerged in court was the way 10-year-old Jade and her 12-year-old best friend would habitually visit Hodgson's cottage after school, staying for five hours, drinking beer and smoking. The 12-year-old had referred to the ecstasy tablets as 'happy pills', leading the police to believe she was familiar with adults taking drugs. Most children try the occasional fag or swig of alcohol but this sounds more like a lifestyle. It seems a terrible irony that, in the name of 'progress', when we are increasingly easy with the vocabulary of children's rights, we are in danger of erasing what it means to be a child. We have turned the clock back three centuries to a time when there was no distinction between adults and their offspring. Until the eighteenth century the young were treated as miniature grown-ups - in work, in bed, in their habits and their dress. Even in Victorian times the young poor dressed and drank like adults and 'rioted sexually'. The difference then was that they had little option. Now it is affluence and 'choice' - that over-inflated consumer 'value' - which breeds our baby adults. The issue of when adolescence begins has never been more confusing. Better health and diet means that puberty has begun a month earlier for every decade of the last century. Girls in the top class of primary school may now appear as physically developed as a teenager. At the same time, the relatively modern role of the parent as a mediator between society and the child has been diluted or destroyed. This may be because of indifference, ignorance or a simple lack of time as both parents are now likely to be out earning money for the child to spend. Writer John Holt, describing the adult's role, uses the metaphor of a walled garden in which children, 'being small and weak, are protected from the harshness of the outside world until they become strong and clever enough to cope with it'. The walls are now tumbling down. Research tells us that, while many young people and teenagers are coping well and have strong ties with their parents, others are faring badly. In The Disappearance of Childhood the academic Neil Postman writes: 'Our children know everything anyone else knows... Nothing is mysterious, nothing is awesome, nothing is held back from public view... In having access to all the previously hidden fruit of adult information, they are expelled from the garden of childhood.' Only a third of homes house a school-age child, so why should the majority care about this premature arrival in adulthood? The answer is because the particular kind of propaganda to which children are subjected is corrosive to the wellbeing of society - and that does effect us all. The young are now constant spectators of a particular kind of desensitised, mercenary, pseudo-glamorous cartoon version of adult life, pumped out in pop videos, television and little girls' magazines. The images are often brutal, sadistic, selfish and without thought, since that appears to be currency of behaviour which generates the most cash. It isn't just the sheer volume of propaganda that's a problem, it is that it happens in an era in which, paradoxically, we have never been more protective of our young. When they should be out, exploring, engaging in adventures and even - God forbid! - taking risks, they are now incarcerated in the home, minded by television and internet - twin sources of so much garbage. At best, both can open a window on the world. At worst, they offer what, in a different era, Richard Hoggart termed 'shiny barbarism'. The Government recently launched a consultation Green Paper, Every Child Matters. The long-term aim is to co-ordinate services and move from crisis management of those at risk to improving the quality of all young peoples' lives, including those in need of extra help. In Community Care, the social policy magazine, Anthony Douglas, director of health and social services in Suffolk, said last week that there are 27,000 children on child-protection registers - but he estimates there are nearly 20 times that number who are in need. Leave aside the issue of a chronic lack of funds and trained staff; another major reservation about any forthcoming legislation is that it seems likely to happen in the absence of any public debate about what precisely a child requires for its material, moral and spiritual welfare. Would Jade, swigging her cans of lager instead of being out, having fun in an adult-free zone, be deemed in need - or thriving? The answer is linked to the larger question of how, in a secular, pluralist society, a moral consensus can be established on what is and isn't good for our children - and for us. Liberals hate to be seen to be judgmental. They are nervous about discussing values, ethics, rules and standards since that smacks of censorship and authoritarianism and children being seen but not heard. Yet, in the absence of such a debate, the idea of a 'normal' childhood is slowing disappearing in the quicksand of adult indulgence and the pursuit of profit. We delude ourselves if we look for solutions in the self-regulation of the media, advertisers or the floggers of mucky merchandise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
