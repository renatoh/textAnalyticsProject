As with the group's acclaimed earlier sessions for ECM, Dance Without Answer mingles Winstone lyrics to her partners' tunes with diverse and audaciously reimagined covers \u2013 of material from Tom Waits's San Diego Serenade and Nick Drake's Time of No Reply to the 1985 Madonna song Live to Tell. Not much hurries, flusters or intensifies Winstone's cool delivery, but her range, control and relaxation in open musical spaces remain awesome, and her pure tones are acquiring a more gravelly informality with the years. Gesing is magnificent, bending slow bass-clarinet sounds on the title track of unstated goodbyes, whooping and wheeling across Venier's adaptation of the Italian poem Gust da Essi Viva. Tomasz Mendez's Cucurrucucu Paloma get a patiently emotional vocal treatment, the Madonna song becomes deep and solemn, the Friulian nursery rhyme A Tor a Tor is playful, but there's no hint of whimsy in the Muppets' anthem Bein' Green. Almost all of it proceeds at a smoulder and a whisper, of course, but Winstone does more in those moods than most."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
