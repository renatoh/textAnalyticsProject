Then, at the opening of the European Food Safety Authority in Parma in late June, prime minister Berlusconi told an international audience that he had had to \"endure\" Finnish food. But where on their occasional and expensive trips to Helsinki, could these Gallic and Latin sour-palates possibly have eaten to form such unkind opinions of a national cuisine that, bland at worst, can be a delight for gourmands and trenchermen alike? My appreciation of Finnish food is late coming, but since marrying a Finn I have begun to travel through the country with my senses attuned to more than its justly admired architecture, music, military history, winters and sporting prowess. Have Chirac and Berlusconi ever sat in a Helsinki cafe, sipped the excellent coffee, munched on a rye bread sandwich, Karelian pie, butter bun or cinnamon roll? Have they ever trawled Finland's gull-adorned waterside city markets for fresh and smoked perch, pike, whitefish and salmon? Has the wonderful Arctic cloudberry never passed their lips? Who knows. But these ungentlemanly fellows really should have dined in one of Helsinki's better restaurants before denouncing an entire nation's menu. It's funny the dishes you end up enjoying that you thought you would never take to. Take, for example Kalakukko fish pie, a herring and bacon pasty. It is quite delicious, and is also sometimes served with perch or trout, and with pork instead of bacon. And what of Jannson's Temptation? Jannson, it seems, was a singularly ascetic parson who preached abstinence and self-control in all things except for this surprisingly delicious baked confection of potatoes, onions, anchovies, butter, breadcrumbs and cream. And then there's Vorschmack, which was a favourite of war-time hero Marshall Mannerheim. He liked to order this dish in the handsome dining room of Helsinki's Savoy restaurant, a Modern Movement treat designed by Alvar Aalto and opened in 1937. You can sit today at the Marshall's banquette and enjoy the same mash of lamb, beef, onions, salt herrings, anchovies, garlic and pepper served with sour cream, baked potatoes, beer and brimming shots of Marskin ryyppy. The latter translates as \"our Marshall's tipple\" and is a soldierly schnapps made to Mannerheim's own recipe Here are my five favourite Helsinki restaurants. \u00b7 Kosmos (Kalevankatu 3, 00358 9 647 255). Classic Finnish dishes served in a happily bohemian city-centre restaurant, still frequented by garrulous artists, writers and hacks, and unchanged since it opened in 1924. Owned, and kept open late, by the same family since new. \u00b7 Elite (Hesperiankatu 22, +9 434 2200). Another artists' favourite, established in 1932, but with politicians, diplomats and bright young things in the mix, set - largely unchanged since 1938 - in the handsome Reitz Building. Impressive, densely hung collection of paintings given by artists tucking into generous plates of fried Baltic herrings and mash, or onion steak. \u00b7 Lehtovaara (Mechelininkatu 39, +9 440 833). A handsome, civilised place off the tourist beat, it has won many awards for its classic Finnish cooking, its lighter modern dishes and eye-boggling wine list. \u00b7 Via (Ludviginkatu 8-10, +9 681 1370). Relaxed, fashionable modern restaurant deftly eased into the magnificent former offices of Helsingin Sanomat, Scandinavia's biggest daily newspaper. Owned and run by Finland's justly popular TV chef, Jyrki Sukula, Via's menu is Mediterranean and Asian influenced, but Sukula's knowledgeable team can do traditional Finnish extremely well, too. \u00b7 Havis (Etel\u00e4ranta 16, +9 6869 5660). New, highly fashionable seafood restaurant in grand old, fin-de-siecle sea captain's house close to the harbour. The head-chef Juuse Mikkonen was Finland's Chef of the Year in 2004."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
