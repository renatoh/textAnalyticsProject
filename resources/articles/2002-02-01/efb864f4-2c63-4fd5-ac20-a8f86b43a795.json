Today's gallop at Noel Chance's stable will give Johnson his first solid clue as to whether the engine that carried him up the hill at Cheltenham in March 2000 is still intact and firing. The jockey was still recovering from a broken leg when Looks Like Trouble returned after 15 months out with a leg injury of his own in the John Bull Chase at Wincanton last month. His impressive success there, with Seamus Durack in the plate, was enough to secure a place at the head of the Gold Cup market, one he seems likely to retain until the tapes go up in 29 days' time. \"He had a week off from the water treadmill, then he was in full training eight days after Wincanton and he hasn't looked back since,\" Chance told the Racing Channel yesterday. \"He does a pretty serious piece of work in the morning, Richard is going to ride him and that will leave him pretty well set up for a racecourse gallop at Kempton after the Racing Post Chase.\" That gallop at Kempton will all but complete the ten-year-old's preparations for the Festival, as Chance tries to keep the stress on his leg to a minimum. \"We don't school him very much at all,\" the trainer said. \"He jumped the last fence at Down Royal the day he got injured and then he jumped three fences for Seamus Durack prior to the Wincanton run, and then jumped around Wincanton. He will jump three fences for Richard Johnson prior to the Gold Cup and that's it. We have never over-schooled him because he is so exuberant.\" With the chaser's fragile tendon in mind, Chance might also prefer a little cut in the Festival going, for all that it was officially good to firm when he won the Gold Cup two years ago. Had the Festival opened yesterday the going would have been soft, according to the clerk of the course Simon Claisse, though he will not hazard a guess at how the track might ride on March 12. \"It's impossible, because it can change so quickly,\" he said yesterday. \"Last year, it would have been heavy on the Tuesday, even though you hear so much about how Cheltenham can never be heavy again be cause there's been so much drainage work. \"That would have been the first time we'd had heavy on the first day since 1982, and the first time on any day of the Festival since 1989. You never want to lose a Festival but, if you were going to, that probably wasn't a bad one to lose.\" However, the going was still good on the previous Friday, despite the wettest winter in living memory. \"This year, from September to now, we've had about 200mm (8in) of rain,\" Claisse said. \"Last year, it was almost 400mm. But then again, two years ago Philip Arkwright was saying he couldn't rule out heavy three weeks before the meeting, and we ended up breaking 11 course records.\" One trainer, though, has already all but given up on a run at the Festival. Howard Johnson, who prepares Direct Route, said yesterday that his chaser is almost certain to miss the Queen Mother Champion Chase and go to Aintree's National meeting instead. \"It's too soft everywhere to do a racecourse gallop and Cheltenham is only four weeks away now - we are running out of time,\" Johnson said. \"I would rather leave him be and send him fresh to Aintree than try and get him ready on ground like this.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
