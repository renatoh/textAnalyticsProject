But the leader of Myanmar has found a new ally in far-right, staunchly anti-immigrant Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. In a rare trip to Europe, state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel peace prize laureate who was once the figurehead of the fight for democracy in Myanmar, met Orb\u00e1n in Budapest. There, the two leaders found common ground on the subject of immigration and Islam . \u201cThe two leaders highlighted that one of the greatest challenges at present for both countries and their respective regions \u2013 south-east Asia and Europe \u2013 is migration,\u201d read a statement released after their meeting. \u201cThey noted that both regions have seen the emergence of the issue of co-existence with continuously growing Muslim populations.\u201d Once lauded as the great democratic hope for Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was elected as civilian leader in 2015 after living under house arrest by the military for 15 years, has proved a marked disappointment to most western governments who were her champions. Her failure to condemn the military\u2019s violent crackdown on the Muslim Rohingya minority in 2017 \u2013 which saw thousands of Rohingya raped and killed in what the UN described as an exercise in ethnic cleansing \u2013 and her defence of the military\u2019s brutal actions against Myanmar\u2019s Muslims have proved particularly contentious. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government has since repeatedly failed to offer assurances to the million Rohingya now living in refugee camps in Bangladesh, where they fled over the border for safety, that if they return their security and pathway to citizenship would be guaranteed. Orban, meanwhile, has an equally bad track record. His government declared a \u201ca crisis situation due to mass immigration\u201d in 2015, stirring up fear in Hungary over an alleged threat of migrants. The Council of Europe\u2019s commissioner for human rights released a recent report accusing Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government of using anti-migrant rhetoric that fuels \u201cxenophobic attitudes, fear and hatred\u201d. Aung San Suu Kyi has increasingly spoken out against the imposition of western ideas and principles in Myanmar, a view which was reflected by Orb\u00e1n in the statement released after their meeting, where he emphasised his rejection of the \u201cexport of democracy\u201d from other western countries. \u201cAung San Suu Kyi has fallen so astonishingly far from being the darling of the EU that she now counts a meeting with Orban, the pariah of Europe, as an important accomplishment,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. \u201cAfter shamefully helping the Myanmar military cover up their genocide against Rohingya Muslims, now she\u2019s glad-handing and making friends with Europe\u2019s most xenophobic, anti-democratic leader.\u201d Robertson added: \u201cThe message of this meeting to Brussels should be clear: Myanmar is not listening to your quiet diplomatic niceties.\u201d A spokesperson for the Myanmar government could not be reached for comment. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s trip to central Europe was with the aim to strengthen economic ties in the region. Prior to Hungary, she visted the Czech Republic where she met with Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
