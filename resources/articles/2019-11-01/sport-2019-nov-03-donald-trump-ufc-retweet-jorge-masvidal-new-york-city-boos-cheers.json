Jorge Masvidal, who won the headline fight against Nate Diaz, was asked his opinion of the President in the run-up to the event. \u201cNo matter what your views on Trump as a president, the guy\u2019s a bad motherfucker,\u201d said the Florida welterweight. The comment appeared to reference the fact that Masvidal fought Diaz for the \u201cBaddest Motherfucker in the Game\u201d belt. On Sunday morning, Trump retweeted the video, along with the obscenity, and wrote \u201cGreat fight Champ!\u201d Trump was greeted with a loud mix of boos and cheers when he took his seat for the fights at Madison Square Garden. Some fans held \u201cTrump 2020 Keep America Great\u201d signs but others directed obscene gestures at the president. Trump was accompanied by his sons Donald Jr and Eric as well as Republican house leader Kevin McCarthy and representatives Peter King of New York and Mark Meadows of North Carolina. On Sunday, Trump praised UFC president Dana White as he tweeted that \u201cwalking into Madison Square Garden last night with White for the big UFC Championship fight was a little bit like walking into a Trump Rally. Plenty of MAGA &amp; KAG present. Great energy. Fantastic job!\u201d The president\u2019s son Eric Trump took issue with reports his father had been booed. He retweeted a BBC story saying his father had been jeered and commented: \u201cWhat a joke. You are the most dishonest people. The audience was chanting \u2018Donald Trump, Donald Trump\u2019 followed by \u2018USA USA.\u2019 Dana White said it was the greatest entrance he has seen into a UFC. I can\u2019t wait until we win again in 2020 to further embarras [sic] your profession #FakeNews\u201d Eric Trump may have been referencing the fact that the crowd broke into \u201cUSA\u201d chants when the American heavyweight Derrick Lewis beat his Bulgarian opponent. \u201cI know everything ain\u2019t going good in the White House,\u201d Lewis said after the fight, before asking Trump to \u201cturn it around\u201d. Even with the boos, Trump\u2019s reception was far better than his last appearance at a sporting event. He was greeted with jeers and chants of \u201cLock him up!\u201d when he attended Game 5 of the World Series last weekend at Nationals Park in Washington DC. Trump has a history with the UFC dating back to 2001, when one of his hotels in Atlantic City hosted a fight card for the mixed martial arts promotion. White spoke in support of Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention. The two men had dinner together last week at the White House, and after Saturday\u2019s event White said he was not worried about the booing. \u201cThis is America, you can believe and do whatever you want,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to boo, you can boo.\u201d Trump will host the World Series champions, the Washington Nationals, at the White House on Monday. One member of the Nationals, pitcher Sean Doolittle, said he will not attend. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d the 33-year-old told the Washington Post, \u201cas much as I wanted to be there with my teammates and share that experience with my teammates, I can\u2019t do it. I just can\u2019t do it.\u201d Doolittle said his opposition to the president was based on \u201ca lot of things, policies that I disagree with, but at the end of the day it has more to do with the divisive rhetoric and the enabling of conspiracy theories and widening the divide in this country\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
