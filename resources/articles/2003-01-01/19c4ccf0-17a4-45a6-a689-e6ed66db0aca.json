It's not that each time an episode is shown she squirms behind the sofa in embarrassment. That, after all, is what we all do - it's the modern equivalent of laughing. It's simply that she doesn't see the joke. The point eludes her entirely. And so, when the rest of us howl our appreciation and gleefully re-enact hilarious scenes, she sits there, blank-faced, excluded. I know how she feels. The rest of the country loves The Office and she doesn't get it. Similarly, the rest of the country loves Clare Short and I don't get it. Absolutely everybody adores Clare. Even my colleagues at the Spectator don't have a bad word to utter, and they can't stand New Labour. They say, \"Ah, but at least Clare has integrity.\" (They like that bat-eared, dissembling bully Charles Clarke, too - but he, at least, has his detractors elsewhere, not least in this newspaper.) So I'm alone in thinking Clare either a fraud or a faux-na\u00eff. One of the two; I'm not sure which. She was out, as usual, this Yuletide, being all Straight-Talking for the press. It's almost as much a seasonal fixture as Morecambe and Wise, Only Fools and Horses and dyspepsia, Clare delivering her candid and honest message to the newspapers. It's a sort of panto act; she bounds on stage to entertain the grumbling New Labour squaddies in the manner of a rather squat and dour Geri Halliwell - and then suddenly hitches up her skirt to reveal bloomers of the deepest scarlet. \"Don't bomb Iraq (yet, probably)!\" \"University top-up fees - um, not convinced so far!\" Later, I reckon, she'll find herself convinced by the necessity of both. That's what has tended to happen in the past with Clare. She complained about government ministers forever setting themselves targets that they couldn't meet - forgetting, perhaps, that she set herself the mother of all targets when, upon ascending to cabinet office, she pledged to eradicate world poverty by about half past six the following Wednesday evening. But most of her contempt was reserved for \"spin\". We'd be all right if it wasn't for people spinning things, she averred. It's not spin doctors that are the problem, believe me. They may, of course, be foul people, as individuals, and one wouldn't wish to mix with them, but they are, in the end, simply trying to put a favourable gloss upon unfortunate events. They are easy enough to see through. No, the real problem is inveterate and almost always counter-productive lying. The government - and 10 Downing Street in particular - seems to lie as a first recourse whenever it is presented with an unforeseen problem. I don't mean about the alleged efficacy of policy measures - that we might expect. I mean telling bare-faced lies about matters of fact that are later exposed as such by what is, I think, a rapacious (and pretty diligent) press. I don't know why they do it. I have been told by one former adviser that it is because they have an utter contempt for and dislike of the media and therefore have no moral qualms whatsoever about feeding journalists a pack of porky-pies. \"They think they will be misrepresented anyway, so why not just lie from the outset? Everything, with the media, is fair game.\" Well, I suppose I can understand that rationale. But the flaw here is that the strategy always seems to backfire, and they get into far more trouble through lying than would otherwise have been the case. Unless, of course, they have lied about loads of other things and got away with it. Take the business with Cherie Blair and Peter Foster. I can see entirely how Cherie, through her entertainingly weird friends, became superficially involved with Foster and it really doesn't bother me in the slightest. I suspect that most of the public would feel the same way. The only reason the story became in anyway significant was Downing Street's decision to lie through its teeth when presented with a series of, on the surface, pretty innocuous questions. Why did they do that? What did it gain them? A similar series of circumstances occurred with the disgrace and eventual departure of Stephen Byers. Here's my guess: had he not lied, he would not have been forced to resign. Who advised him to lie? I bet somebody did. I bet somebody said, \"Steve, mate, don't tell them the truth about the business with Martin Sixsmith.\" And so he lied and, when the lie was exposed - as it was always going to be exposed through his multifarious enemies in the Department of Transport - he had to go. And there have been plenty more lies, all of which, later, have been revealed as such and dragged the government into the mire. I don't believe, as my sometime colleague Peter Hitchens seems to, that Britain under Blair is like East Germany under Erich Honecker. I think that's stretching it a bit. But the thing that will bring this government down is losing the trust of the people. Incompetence, policy failings and spin doctors will not count half so much at the polling booth as the perception of a government that will lie, obfuscate and dissemble on an almost pathological basis. And the sad thing is, they don't really need to. The cat's out of the bag There have been strange goings-on at Rushy Platt, a nature reserve near Swindon opened two years ago to provide, among other things, a breeding ground for our most endangered mammal, the water vole. The excellent Wiltshire Wildlife Trust had made the place secure from those Muslim fundamentalists of British wildlife, the \"American\" mink. Environmentalists loathe and fear mink, believing them to constitute all by themselves an axis of evil responsible for the wholesale genocide of voles, fish and various stupid wading birds. But they hate them most of all because they are illegal immigrants (from the US, via local fur farms). Conservationists tend to like a racially pure stock of wildlife, forgetting - as xenophobes are wont to - that a large proportion of our native wildlife is not, actually, very native at all. Anyway, at Rushy Platt, despite \"heavy security\" (presumably ID cards for all itinerant mammals and x-ray screening of their travel bags), the entire population of voles has nonetheless been wiped out. So a local expert, Mark Satinet, staked out the place and fingered the villain. And he discovered what the rest of us might have guessed - Rushy Platt was seething with murderous bloody cats. Sadly, I doubt that the conservationists will apply to these unspeakable, ingratiating (and no less \"foreign\") creatures the solution usually visited upon mink - high powered rifles with expensive night sights. But they should. And at the same time carry out a few more surveys in other parts of the country which will similarly, I suspect, exonerate the beautiful, unfairly persecuted mink. RIP, IDS Oh dear: just what he needed. Iain Duncan Smith will enjoy a very good 2003, according to that death rattle of a political analyst, William Rees Mogg. Poor Duncan Smith. The hammering you can hear in the background is the last nail being driven irrevocably into his coffin lid. I had originally thought IDS would hang on until at least Easter, but Rees Mogg's intervention has convinced me it may well be all over by the close of Twelfth Night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
