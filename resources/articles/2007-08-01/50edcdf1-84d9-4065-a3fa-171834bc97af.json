On Friday, the former cabinet minister will return to the political front line when he presents a long-awaited report to the Tory leadership on how to improve the competitiveness of the British economy. An ardent Thatcherite, Redwood will outline plans for dramatic cuts in red tape to save British business \u00a314bn a year. His targets will include the European Social Chapter - Britain's opt out would be restored - EU working time regulations and British laws which restrict the ability of companies to make workers redundant. The diet of traditional Tory policies, which will delight the party's right wing, will be welcomed by the Conservative leadership. George Osborne, the shadow chancellor who returns from holiday tomorrow to attend the launch of the report, is keen to mend fences with industry and to show the party is brimming with ideas after a difficult couple of months. But the leadership regards the commission as a key moment for the party for another reason. Redwood, the passionate tax cutter, will confirm that he accepts David Cameron's formula on the highly sensitive issue of tax. 'The Redwood report represents the right of the party buying into David [Cameron] and George's line that tax cuts can only be made when economic conditions allow,' one source said. Redwood will, however, stretch the Cameron formula to its limits when he identifies a series of taxes, mainly for businesses, that should be cut if that would not jeopardise the stability of the economy. Downing Street, which would love to repeat the successes of the 2001 and 2005 election campaigns when Labour depicted the Tories as irresponsible tax cutters, will pounce on the report as evidence that Cameron is an instinctive tax cutter. Gordon Brown believes that an issue like tax cuts highlights a key Cameron weakness. When the Tory leader allows the idea of tax cuts to be floated, he vacates the centre ground where elections are won. If tax cuts are taken off the agenda, then the right is unhappy and party unity is at risk, goes the Brown thinking. The Cameron team will dismiss the criticisms and say the Redwood commission shows how the party is embarking on serious policy work. The leadership hopes that a strong August, in which the Tories outline many substantial new ideas, will provide a good platform for Cameron when he returns from his holiday a week from tomorrow. A carefully planned August offensive, run by the Tories' new media chief Andy Coulson and featuring a rota of shadow cabinet big hitters, has been commanding the airwaves in a way that would have been unimaginable just a few weeks ago. Shadow ministers, who had been outlining plans on health, welfare and pensions, had a rare spring in their step in the sunshine of last week, though the mountain they have to climb is highlighted by today's YouGov poll in the Sunday Times which gives Labour a 10 point lead over the Tories. The brains behind the offensive is a lugubrious figure dubbed - even by his friends - 'the Norman Tebbit of the 21st century'. Chris Grayling, the shadow work and pensions secretary, who normally buries himself under mounds of paper in his Westminster office, came up with the idea of advising voters to 'read the small print' when assessing Brown's blizzard of announcements in his first month as Prime Minister. The party believes it has now found a clear and catchy way of highlighting a central weakness of the Brown government. Behind recent dramatic announcements, such as an extra \u00a3200m for flood defences, lie less attractive provisos, which in the case of the floods meant the extra money would not be introduced for four years. 'The basic essence of the \"small print\" [campaign] is to point out that these announcements do not stack up,' Grayling told The Observer. 'We are determined to ensure that Gordon Brown doesn't get away with it.' One of the boldest - or most foolhardy - moves in the 'small print' campaign has involved the Tories venturing into an area where they have been wary of treading since their uncomfortable experience in the 2001 election: Europe. Shadow foreign secretary and former leader William Hague, who admits that he made a grave error when he based almost the entire 2001 election campaign on combating the 'foreign land' of the EU, now believes it is safe to lambast the government for introducing the new European treaty without a referendum. Once a draft of the treaty had been translated into English, the 'small print' showed that at least 90 per cent of the discredited constitution had been preserved, Hague claimed. If it were right to hold a referendum on the constitution - as Labour's 2005 manifesto pledged - then why not vote on the new treaty, the Tories ask. Hague insists he is not reliving his ill-fated lurch to the right on Europe, not least because he has openly advised David Cameron against 'doing a Hague'. One aide said: 'This is not about wrapping ourselves in the union flag as we did in 2001. This is about a very matter of fact approach to Europe, which says the constitution is being sneaked through.' Turning up the volume on Europe presents both opportunities and dangers for the Tories. A simple message that people should have a say will, they hope, resonate in the way it did in 2004 when Tony Blair was forced to make a U-turn and agree to hold a referendum on the EU constitution. Rows over the new treaty will drag into next year anyway - the measure will have to be ratified in Parliament after a formal signing ceremony in Brussels in December - allowing the Tories to put pressure on Brown at the very moment when he will want to talk about health and education in the run-up to a possible spring election. Europe occupies a curious place in public opinion. The Tories seem to more closely reflect voters' feeling than Labour - 81 per cent of voters want a referendum, according to a poll in yesterday's Sun. But Europe usually ranks far down in the list of voters' priorities, indicating that people will turn off a party that focuses on the EU rather than bread-and-butter issues. Amid little fanfare, David Cameron slipped across the English Channel last Monday to catch up with his family, who had gone on holiday without him after he delayed his departure over the foot and mouth outbreak. Aides had told Cameron in clear terms that he needed to disappear for two weeks both for the wellbeing of his family and for calculated political reasons. 'You can only draw a line between the end of term, which wasn't great, and the new political season if you go away,' one Tory said. The need to clear the air was apparent: Cameron, who had had a poor end to the political year after a hand-picked Tory candidate bombed in the Ealing Southall byelection, did himself no favours in the final week before the holiday. In a tetchy interview on Radio 4's Today programme, he dismissed criticisms from Ali Miraj, the former Tory A-lister, by saying Miraj had been demanding a peerage the previous day. 'That interview was petulant and made David look silly,' one shadow minister said. Cameron's response to Miraj gave a hint of the nervousness at the highest level of the Tory party amid feelings that the leadership had blundered in its response to Brown's first month in office. The major mistake, according to senior members of the shadow cabinet, was that Cameron underestimated Brown's ability to present himself as a fresh face who would not abandon the centre ground. The finger is being pointed at Osborne for assuming that Brown would not be able to connect like his predecessor, creating an opportunity for Cameron to present himself as the heir to Blair. 'George was rather more impressed by Blair than David has ever been,' one well-placed source said. 'Perhaps it was because he worked with William when he was leader. David has always thought Blair was no more than an excellent leader of the Labour party, whereas George thought he was a rather good prime minister.' The plan to position Cameron in the centre ground vacated by Blair while Brown embarked on an expected lurch to the left created what one senior source described as 'mixed signals'. 'The sweeping statement that we were heirs to Blair, and Gordon Brown would lurch to the left, was not the right critique. You cannot say Brown has been at the heart of the government for 10 years and then say he will lurch to the left. The right critique is to say: \"Look what he is doing - read the small print.\"' The Tories believe they have recovered their momentum. But as one Conservative veteran said: 'Let's not get carried away. It's August. Nothing serious happens. The government has sensibly decided to go on holiday. Let's just see what happens when the cabinet returns en masse.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
