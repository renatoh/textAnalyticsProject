Back when Jackson unveiled his first Lords outing, everyone was impressed that he'd brought it to the screen with an appropriate sense of grandeur and excitement, and for once the prospect of two sequels didn't seem too daunting. Ah, but look at what came afterwards: soon enough, part one of The Chronicles Of Narnia, the wimpiest books in pre-adult British literature, a sure indicator of Martin Prince levels of sissihood in the reader. And now another trilogy opener, Eragon, which looks like an adaptation of some lost Narnia novel that CS Lewis himself thought was so girly and wimpy he strangled it in its crib. In each we find gigantic battles redolent of the Jackson films, boringly magical creatures, uncharismatic children promoted into leading roles, and grandiose old thespian frauds wheeled out for stentorian speechifying and easy money. I was sick of all this before I was 10, the exact moment of my disillusionment arriving, if memory serves, about 15 minutes into Pete's Dragon. Enough. If we must remain becalmed in this fantasy rut, then let's find better fantasies to film. To that end, maybe someone could give us a multi-million dollar adaptation of Bored Of The Rings, the 1969 satirical bestseller that energetically mocked the hippy generation's blissed-out enthusiasm for The Lord Of The Rings. Written by the future founders of the National Lampoon, including the late Doug Kenney, who later blessed us with Animal House and Caddyshack. It only takes a few paragraphs to see why a million potheads bought the book. The names alone probably did it, being half sex toys and half consumer products: Dildo Bugger, Frito and his loyal valet Spam, Legolam, etc. All live in fear of Lord Sorhed's Dark Carbuncle of Doom, which \"has swollen and will soon come to a head, covering the face of Lower Middle Earth with his ill humours... It must be soundly lanced.\" The perfect director of such a project, with all its eruptive bodily excrescences and juvenile, humour, would be the young Peter Jackson - not the eminence grise of Wellington, but the enfant terrible who made Bad Taste and Meet The Feebles. Anyone who recalls the deft SteadiCam shot that follows the Alien Interception and Destruction Squad (AIDS!) through the forest in Bad Taste, finally zooming in so close behind them that we can clearly see a widening stain on the beige slacks of (sometime cast member) Jackson himself, will know how perfect a choice he'd make. Please. Anything to stop him making The Hobbit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
