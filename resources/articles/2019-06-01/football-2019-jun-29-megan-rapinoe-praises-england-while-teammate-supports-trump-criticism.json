Especially one of the biggest teams in the game. They are playing well and had a totally dominating performance, they should absolutely be confident. We like confidence in America don\u2019t we?\u201d she added with a wry smile. The swagger of this USA team as they power towards reclaiming their status as world champions is unyielding. Except while the Americans have led from the front for so long, streaks ahead of their closest rivals, now they are looking over their shoulders. The Europeans are catching up fast, with increasing investment in the domestic leagues fuelling the charge. The USA were the only non-European side in the quarter-finals, and they will be flying the flag for the rest of the world in the last four. Rapinoe can see the difference and where they need to improve if they are to pull clear once more. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret we have to get better on the ball, better playing with it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe level is just growing every day in the women\u2019s game. You\u2019ve seen some fantastic performances.\u201d With the heat meaning many teams are training early and late, watching the Lionesses\u2019 3-0 defeat of Norway was not a planned sit-down affair, but they did catch bits. \u201cEngland were super-clinical against Norway so we absolutely have our work cut out,\u201d said Rapinoe, who is unsurprised by the growth of this England team. \u201cI think that they, as a federation, have put a lot of money behind that programme and they\u2019ve been on the rise. \u201cWithout that devastating own goal in the last World Cup [which condemned England to a 2-1 defeat by Japan in the semi-finals] we could\u2019ve been facing them in the final in Canada. They have been right there and have such a strong squad and really good young players coming up.\u201d With five goals to bring her level with her teammate Alex Morgan, England\u2019s Ellen White and the eliminated Australian Sam Kerr, the battle between Rapinoe and Crystal Dunn versus Lucy Bronze and Nikita Parris on the wings will be the focus of Tuesday evening\u2019s semi-final in Lyon. Ali Krieger, the defender who spoke out on Twitter in support of Rapinoe\u2019s criticism of Donald Trump, said \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be silent\u201d after Friday\u2019s 2-1 defeat of the hosts France. \u201cBecause you feel like you\u2019re complicit. I don\u2019t want to be that anymore, it doesn\u2019t take a lot of mind space to tweet something and refocus. It\u2019s funny, women can multitask. Imagine that! Two things at once. \u201cI thought it was really important for me to not make [Rapinoe] feel like she has to process this all alone, and a lot of us have similar feelings.\u201d Krieger described Thursday night\u2019s England game as \u201c\u2018great fun to watch\u201d, adding: \u201cThe goals were really good. They\u2019re a strong, physical team, they\u2019re mentally tough, but we\u2019re prepared for whatever team comes at us. It\u2019s going to be another exciting game, it\u2019s going to be so much fun because at the highest level you want to play against the best teams in the world \u2013 and we\u2019re doing that right now.\u201d Jill Ellis, the USA coach, said: \u201cI watched some of it. We had training but caught some of the game. I think it was a dominant performance as Megan said. They\u2019ve got a lot of talented players. To single one out? I don\u2019t know, their frontline and the striker is hot right now. I still want to know what this [she does Ellen White\u2019s celebration with one hand] means? But they are a good team front to back, with a lot of experienced players so it\u2019s going to be a good match up.\u201d The Americans have a day less than England to recover and, having played a more gruelling match, essentially what many have described as a final two games before the actual final, efficient recovery is key. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in this position before, and the tournament is mentally, emotionally, physically draining,\u201d said the 34-year-old Krieger. \u201cYou have to take a step back, put the phones away, say hello to your families quickly and get back to refreshing and recovering, getting your body back to 100% for three days from now. It\u2019s tough, but we\u2019re immune to that. We\u2019re very good at it, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been training for the last four years and some of us even beyond that. We\u2019re used to it, we\u2019re comfortable doing it and we\u2019re prepared to do it.\u201d Ellis added: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to let players enjoy this moment because that was a gritty win. Again, we\u2019re going to have less days recovery than our opponent but that\u2019s the rhythm for us in this cup, so be it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
