Despite playing for 55 minutes with 10 men, his team not only held but could easily have beaten a hugely disappointing PSV Eindhoven. A draw was also enough for them to win the group. Arsenal had been poor before Kolo Tour\u00e9's red card and were understandably not at their best after. But Rami Shaaban had only one save to make and it was impossible to spot that Wenger's team were a man short. Had the substitute Sylvain Wiltord taken one of a couple of chances they might even have won, though PSV hit the bar late on. PSV had come into this match with more to play for than Arsenal. Whereas Wenger's squad knew before kick-off that they were guaranteed a place in the second group stage, the Dutch club were chasing third spot and entry into the Uefa Cup. This draw and Auxerre's win has denied PSV even that. Although Wenger had insisted he was keen to win the group, his selection betrayed the fact that he also saw this as an opportunity to rest key players ahead of the derby at home to Tottenham on Saturday and the busy upcoming Premiership and European programme. Gilberto Silva, Ashley Cole, Dennis Bergkamp, Wiltord and Freddie Ljungberg were left on the bench. Moreover, with Shaaban making his debut in goal in place of the injured David Seaman, and Igors Stepanovs filling in for Sol Campbell, there had been plenty to worry Arsenal fans. That only increased when Tour\u00e9 was sent off after 35 minutes. The Ivory Coast international, filling in at left-back, could have no complaints at the bookings he received for two fouls on Dennis Rommedahl inside six minutes. The second, a trip on the Danish winger, was foolish and showed Tour\u00e9's lack of experience and the fact that he is uncomfortable at left-back. He also struggled there in the sec ond half of the Worthington Cup tie against Sunderland. Though a dull first half had been niggly rather than nasty, there was another unsavoury incident - missed by the Norwegian referee - not long after Tour\u00e9 became the 46th player to be sent off since Wenger took over in 1996. Thierry Henry was late in a challenge on Mark van Bommel and the Dutchman appeared to react by spitting towards Henry, who had his back turned. That at least provided a talking point in a game sadly lacking in incident and quality. Arsenal's lack of incentive and key players made for a first-half display which was workmanlike at best. Even in the early stages, when they had plenty of possession, they did not show the thrust, creativity or finishing they are capable of. Their only two opportunities had fallen in the first eight minutes to Francis Jeffers, who should have taken at least one. He had not long headed wide from an excellent Henry cross when he failed to take a one on one. Robert Pires's pass put him through but his touch was poor, his body language suggested indecisiveness and Ronald Waterreus was able to block. The absence of urgency and zip from Arsenal's play was understandable but PSV were disappointing given their need for at least a point. They had started by pulling men behind the ball and Arsenal's passing soon disintegrated. Henry was not figuring as much as he might have liked and the team were bereft of ideas. Pires and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, both still feeeling their way back from knee injuries, were not bursting into the box from wide areas as Wenger likes and Arsenal seemed to miss the vision of Bergkamp or the injured Nwankwo Kanu behind Henry. Tour\u00e9's departure forced Arsenal to adopt a 4-3-2 formation, with Van Bronckhorst dropping to left-back. It would have been natural to expect PSV to seize the initiative, yet they remained strangely passive to begin with. Briefly Guus Hiddink's team exerted more pressure but Shaaban, who had looked nervous at times, made a good save when tested for the first time when he blocked Mateja Kezman's shot with a leg and had looked in little danger of conceding as time ran down. Arsenal (4-4-2): Shaaban; Luzhny, Stepanovs, Cygan, Toure; Pires, Vieira, Edu, Van Bronckhorst; Jeffers (Wiltord, 69), Henry (Bergkamp, 64). PSV Eindhoven (4-4-2): Waterreus; Bogelund, Ooijer, Hofland, Bouma; Rommedahl, Van Bommel, Vogel (Lucius, 42), Robben; Bruggink, Kezman. Referee: T H Ovrebo (Norway)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
