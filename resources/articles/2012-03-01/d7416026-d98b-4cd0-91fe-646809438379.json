They start the series at the very bottom of the barrel; they are one plotline away from introducing an alien. But they also have Ted Danson, so it's not all bad news: \"Look at that,\" he says, pointing to the rust formation in the ceiling of a Las Vegas casino tramcar wherein two humans have expired. \"It looks just like the Centaurus constellation. Isn't that neat?\" This is supposed to mark him out as an annoying intellectual, even though the statement is only true if you take as your opening position that all splodges look a little bit like stars. \"And that looks like a ricochet.\" Ah ha! He's an annoying intellectual, but he knows his way around a likely bullet trajectory. Jorja Fox seems to like him, although she gives people that look (\"You're interesting,\" it says. \"I'd sure like to know more about you\") even when they're dead. Particularly when they're dead. I'm going to issue a spoiler alert, though its spoiling a dish that's already inedible. The deaths occurred when a man, Tom, leapt onto a train, having been inconveniently but not tragically stabbed, because he was soon to die anyway of lung cancer. His brother, Jimmy, tries to kill himself by putting a sandwich bag over his head and lying in the bath. This is what happens, kids, when you get your suicide tips off the internet. Sometimes it's better just to go back to 19th century literature. Jimmy is scared of being implicated in Tom's partial-but-not-really murder, plus he feels guilty because he wasn't concentrating \u2013 he was busy ogling a prostitute who had an octopus in her handbag. Her intention was to use it for sex, later, before a live audience (the octopus was also live, before someone shot it). It's a resounding argument for the free market as the agent of diversity. In a city with enough sex shows, there's no one who isn't catered for. Sorry, back to the prostitute \u2013 although Japanese by descent, her short, snooty vowels betray that she is English. Of course she is. What other kind of freak shags an octopus? The one in her bag was called Claude and ate shrimp. \"He was fussy, but he was worth it.\" Huh. It transpires that she was actually in love with the octopus. Ted Danson, intuiting this, uses it dazzlingly to his own advantage. The programme has that West Wing atmosphere, where sentences explode fast and leave you wondering whether it was the individual words you didn't understand, or the order in which they came. Unlike West Wing, it turns out you didn't understand it because it was animal crackers. While our not-quite-a-heroine was testing the boundaries of fidelity with her eight-membered lovetoy, down the road a man was found dead with his skin wrinkled clean away from his muscle mass. His demise is actually too complicated to go into here; enough to say that when a deer kicks you in the stomach, there are probably things you could do that would promote a faster return to health than attaching a high-pressure airvalve to your wound and inflating your torso. That's the real problem \u2013 not that CSI has exhausted all possible causes of death proffered by the modern world; rather that, leechlike, they have sucked all the blood out of sentient humanity. They're left with a ragtag of characters so improbably reckless that the mystery is not how they died, but how they managed to survive so long. It is a weird thing about television that once its presenters reach a certain age, they become veterans in more than name: they accrue a hallowed respect, as if they've been doing something really serious all this time. It's as if David Frost really did fight in a war, and defend our freedoms in perpetuity. And it's hardwired, I'm afraid; I really couldn't say anything rude about him if I tried. But sure, he has more going for him, in Frost On Interviews (BBC4), than an extremely long career. He has free range of the BBC archive, of Tony Benn's memory, of Joan Bakewell's anecdote Rolodex. He has it all, it's mesmerising. I particularly liked the bit where Leslie Mitchell, before they start recording, is tutoring Anthony Eden in how to be interviewed. \"From the moment socialists got into power in 1945, prices started rising \u2026\" \"Do you say that?\" \"No, you say that.\" Some people might say they still do that, before Newsnight. But not me. I don't think that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
