Set a fairytale 406, they were all out for 120. Harry Podmore snaffled five for 41 , including Chris Nash and Joe Clarke in the same over. The Nottinghamshire captain Steven Mullaney was blunt in response: \u201cIt\u2019s not quite a car crash yet, but our decision making has been poor. We\u2019ve been the worst team in this division by a long stretch in the opening seven games. You get what you deserve in this game, and we deserve to be bottom.\u201d At York, Warwickshire survived a mid-innings collapse of six for 49 to beat Yorkshire by three wickets and pocket their third Championship win, quite a turnabout since the spring. Set a target of 217, Dom Sibley and the big hitting Will Rhodes \u2013 who smashed three sixes off one over - reached 132 without loss. But left-arm spinner James Logan, 21, and playing only in his second game, had a spring in his heels, taking four for 22. The charge, however, had come too late. Leicestershire and Gloucestershire shook hands after tea, their big-bucket run fest at Grace Road coming to a close with Hasan Azad and Paul Horton both 100 not out. Earlier Ryan Higgins was out for 199. There is plenty of life left on the final day at Kidderminster, where Sussex clawed themselves back into the match against Worcestershire thanks to spirited batting from Laurie Evans (106 not out) and Ben Brown. In the one remaining game, Sussex are fighting back - a lead of 62 thanks to Evans and Brown. I\u2019ll disappear for a little now, to write up. Er - Warwickshire? I had to deal with a slight situation and ran back to type up the easy Warwickshire win...219 for seven?!?! Losing 5-34?!?! Yorkshire didn\u2019t plug in their James Logan bot till a little too late, alas. Anyway, well done Warwickshire. On the way now, I think. And bravo to York - so glad you got a thriller after the rain on day one. Sussex dribble into the lead at Kidderminster, lead of 11 with six wickets in hand. A invaluable partnership of 106 between Laurie Evans and that man again..... Ben Brown. He\u2019s fourth in the Division Two averages with 609 runs at 76.12 Hands have been shaken at Grace Road with Azad and Horton both exactly 100 not out! Hope the sun\u2019s out for a bit of mid-summer chilling after that thousand run plus festival of batting. Perhaps a balti all round? Completely against the run of play at York, a wicket. At 170 for two, Warwickshire need 47 to win. Northants doing pretty well in that Australia A game, 258-9 with seven balls to go. A fifty for Rob Newton; Ashton Agar 3-55. So where we are at just after tea on day four ? Three games left: a dead one at Grace Road and a easy stroll for the Bears, barring disaster, at York. Then a potentially interesting one at Kidderminster, if Sussex can show a bit of batting spine for two sessions -it\u2019s only day three there. Trouble at mill. Division One York: Yorkshire 259 (SA Patterson 60, GS Ballance 54, O J Hannon-Dalby 5-76, CN Miles 4-44) &amp; 211 (Leaning 65) Hannon-Dalby 4-61, Patel 4-48); Warwickshire 254 (DP Sibley 67) &amp; 133-1 (Rhodes 83, Sibley 50 not out). WARWICKS NEED 84 TO WIN. Tunbridge Wells: Kent 309 (Z Crawley 111, G Stewart 59, J L Pattinson 6-73) &amp; 363-5 declared (JL Denly 161 not out, DJ Bell-Drummond 79); Nottinghamshire 267 (CD Nash 67, SR Patel 52, ME Milnes 5-68) &amp; 120 (Podmore 5-41). KENT WIN BY 285 RUNS. Division Two Kidderminster: Sussex 255 (BC Brown 80, CJ Jordan 52, WD Parnell 4-92) &amp; 83-4; Worcestershire 383 (CJ Ferguson 56, MH Wessels 55, OB Cox 61; Robinson 5-84). Grace Road: Leicestershire 487 (NJ Dexter 180, Mohammed Azad 137, CN Ackermann 56no, J Shaw 4-85) &amp; 131-0 (Azad 56, Horton 64); Gloucestershire 571 (RF Higgins 199, CDJ Dent 176,; Klein 4-113). Paul Horton making up for his first innings duck, when there were zillions on offer. Currently 64 not out in a first-innings partnership of 131 with Hasan Azad. Lovely batting practice, this. Assuming all goes as it seems, this will be Kent and Warwickshire\u2019s second wins of the season. Leaving Notts and Surrey stranded with no wins by late June. Cricket, it does like to flummox you. There\u2019s a poignancy about the cricket scoreboard. Hope is there till the very end. \u201cNottinghamshire need 305 runs to win\u201d Warwickshire 110, over half way there with ten wickets in hand - too easy. Bald facts from Graham in the York tent. Scores are level at Grace Road -571 each. Jim, is there a special klaxon for that? Oh dear, Notts, oh dear. 94 for 7. Oh dear Sussex, oh dear, dear. 30 for 3. Except at Kidderminster, there\u2019s a post-prandial lull. For a moment, batting is easy. Sussex at risk of slipping up here, at 12 for 2 and still 116 behind. This match still has a day in hand remember. Finch, b Finch, for four. I\u2019ll give Vic a plug, as he\u2019s too modest to do it himself. The great man has described it as \u201cgentle\u201d read. Can\u2019t wait. Leicestershire 50 for 0; and an early wicket at Kidderminster. Wells lbw to the fifth ball of the innings for a duck. Sussex 11 for 1. Mullaney out for 11, an lbw for Mulder. Notts 75 for six. Warwickshire off to an absolute flyer at York. Sitting pretty at 52-0, only 161 to win. Dom Sibley\u2019s season creeps up on everyone. Now for the score from Tunbridge Wells. Notts are half way through their Notts-up at 72 for five. Can Mullaney and Moores save the day? Shane comes in off his long run, and a(nother) lovely story coming out of Somerset. Here\u2019s to you, Jack Harding from all at CCLive! Division One York: Yorkshire 259 (SA Patterson 60, GS Ballance 54, O J Hannon-Dalby 5-76, CN Miles 4-44) &amp; 211 (Leaning 65) Hannon-Dalby 4-61, Patel 4-48); Warwickshire 254 (DP Sibley 67) &amp; 20-0. WARWICKS NEED 197 TO WIN. Tunbridge Wells: Kent 309 (Z Crawley 111, G Stewart 59, J L Pattinson 6-73) &amp; 363-5 declared (JL Denly 161 not out, DJ Bell-Drummond 79); Nottinghamshire 267 (CD Nash 67, SR Patel 52, ME Milnes 5-68) &amp; 56-4 (Podmore 3-24). NOTTS NEED 350 TO WIN. Division Two Not lunch: Kidderminster: Sussex 255 (BC Brown 80, CJ Jordan 52, WD Parnell 4-92); Worcestershire 364-9 (CJ Ferguson 56, MH Wessels 55, OB Cox 61; Robinson 4-77). Grace Road: Leicestershire 487 (NJ Dexter 180, Mohammed Azad 137, CN Ackermann 56no, J Shaw 4-85) &amp; 35-0; Gloucestershire 571 (RF Higgins 199, CDJ Dent 176,; Klein 4-113). With two minutes to go till lunch, Notts are 54 for four. A wicket for Grant Stewart to complement Podmore\u2019s three. Samit Patel gone for six. The batsmens\u2019 confidence is non existent at the moment, must be a tricky dressing-room to be in. Some snazzy names here on the Australia A scoresheet. Worth a pop down to The County Ground if you\u2019re nearby. Over at Trent Bridge, David Warner has a hundred - off 109 balls - and Australis are 197 for one off 34 overs. Some CricViz stats that show he is playing himself into ominous form: to his first 30 balls he played false shots 17% of the time. Since his 90th delivery there hasn\u2019t been a false shot. Worcestershire quietly ploughing on - they\u2019ve added 70 this morning, through Parnell and Leach, Cox and D\u2019Oliveria. And a handshake for Jeetan Patel - 700 wickets for Warwickshire! A serious question - what would they do without him? Gloucestershire all out for a magnificent 571. Trumpets and brass bands all round. Funny, after all those runs on both sides the Gloucestershire lead was only 56. A lot of running just to keep still. Oh heck, Notts. The gurgle has started. Podmore has snaffled three for 23. A duck for Joe Clarke. He shouldered arms and was lbw - his nightmarish mid-season continues. Seven for Nash. Here is the final wicket to fall in the Yorkshire innings. Is it a knell? Four each for Hannon-Dalby and Patel. Warwickshire need 217 to win. A solve-able equation. Can someone do a maths joke? Ben Duckett out for 23. Hmmm. Notts 36 for one. The plug being pulled out of the bath, or just a rubber duck falling into the bubbles? Bens Slater and Duckett are making a solid start at Tunbridge Wells: Notts 17/0. van Buuren has followed Higgins back to the pavilion at Grace Road: Gloucestershire 551 for eight. And that little run machine Ben Cox goes for 61 at Kidderminster, Worcestershire have a sneeze of a lead of 37 over Sussex. Yorkshire lose another. Logan for 7, a third for the irrepressible Jeetan Patel. He needs a few more to keep in touch with Simon Harmer (42) in the cut-throat competition for leading Divison One wicket-taker. Luis Reece has a small lead in the Division Two (31) bowl off. A few wickets in the air this morning. At York Patterson is bowled by Oliver Hannon-Dalby. James Logan has come in and cuts a boundary straight away. Jack Leaning a steady 55 and counting on his home ground. Kent have lost two quick wickets and - they\u2019ve DECLARED! at 363 for five after a bit of ball-thumping from Denly. Denly 167 not out. Notts set 406 to win. Ahem. Oh dear, that really is a shame. Ryan Higgins out for 199 at Grace Road, bowled by Chris Wright. Division One York: Yorkshire 259 (SA Patterson 60, GS Ballance 54, O J Hannon-Dalby 5-76, CN Miles 4-44) &amp; 178-7; Warwickshire 254 (DP Sibley 67). Tunbridge Wells: Kent 309 (Z Crawley 111, G Stewart 59, J L Pattinson 6-73) &amp; 277-3 (JL Denly 111 no, DJ Bell-Drummond 79); Nottinghamshire 267 (CD Nash 67, SR Patel 52, ME Milnes 5-68). Division Two Kidderminster: Sussex 255 (BC Brown 80, CJ Jordan 52, WD Parnell 4-92); Worcestershire 262-6 (CJ Ferguson 56, MH Wessels 55, OB Cox 53 no). Grace Road: Leicestershire 487 (NJ Dexter 180, Mohammed Azad 137, CN Ackermann 56no, J Shaw 4-85); Gloucestershire 503-6 (RF Higgins 196no, CDJ Dent 176, BAC Howell 52). Result: Lancashire (236 &amp; 4-0) beat Derbyshire (153 &amp; 84) by 10 wickets. Result: Middlesex (410 &amp; 125-4) v Glamorgan (288) \u2013 match drawn. There is a rain delay at Kidderminster, just as Sussex were about to take the new ball. Northants news: Adam Rossington has signed a two year contract extension with the club, and will captain them in red ball cricket for the rest of the season, following the resignation of Alex Wakely. Also, just because everyone loves Moeen Ali. Ali Martin showed me this on Tuesday. It\u2019s from 2015 but it\u2019s a little gem. And this little nugget could make things interesting at Trent Bridge, where Australia won the toss, are batting and are 9-0 off two overs. Here\u2019s Jimmy in all his glory, in case you didn\u2019t catch him yesterday. Hello! Hope you\u2019ve all had a good couple of days. It feels strange dropping in at the end, just for the glory, though I see Lancs have continued their dominance of division two. Elsewhere, can anyone see Notts chasing 300 plus in a day? Maybe they can last the match. And well done Joe Denly. Could be very tasty at York with a lead of 183 for Yorkshire with three wickets in hand. In Division Two Leicester and Gloucester has degenerated into a run-fest, and it is day three of an even-stevens game at Kidderminster. Over at Trent Bridge, fingers crossed for Bangladesh \u2013 if Australia win that, there are a basketload of dead matches at Old Trafford, Chester le Street, Headingley and Lord\u2019s to come. It\u2019s the downside of doing the matches in chunks - though obviously these grounds could have been left with all the nail-biters. For all the bad decisions, and the limited size of the World Cup, I feel for the organisers \u2013 a double whammy of bad weather and overtly dominant performances from the big four. Follow Bangladesh v Australia here with Geoff Lemon: In other World Cup news, the cheekily talented Rishabh Pant replaces Shikhar Dharwan, whose thumb isn\u2019t playing fair. And at the County Ground, Northampton take on Australia A in a one-day game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
