As such, the Beach Hut's driftwood decor more than fits the bill, the views on to the surf could pass for Byron Bay on at least 10 days a year, as could the flotsam clientele with their wetsuits and sea-salt-matted hair. But it's the food served up by this former bucket and spade shop that really hits home. In Britain, tradition has generally dictated that a beach cafe's food should come straight from the deep freezer into the deep fryer, but the Beach Hut uses local suppliers to produce delicious, hearty no-fuss food, which sit alongside surf staples such as hot chocolate with marshmallows. Open all year round, which shows resilience, and makes the Beach Hut a powerful ally in the continual struggle against adversity that is the typical British beach experience. \u00b7 Beach Hut (01637 860877)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
