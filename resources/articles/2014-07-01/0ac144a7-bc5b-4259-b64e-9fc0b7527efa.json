As Alejandro Sabella\u2019s agent revealed to an Argentinian radio station that he planned to step down after the World Cup final, Zabaleta vowed to ensure their coach went out on a high against Germany . The Manchester City full-back echoed the surprise of the rest of the footballing world at Brazil\u2019s \u201cstrange\u201d capitulation in Belo Horizonte but said his robust and resolute Argentina side would not make the same mistake if they lost an early goal. \u201cEven if you concede some goals before 15 minutes or 20 minutes you need to keep calm and keep playing in the same way as we have been doing for these six games,\u201d said Zabaleta, whose tears of relief and battered, bruised face after their semi-final victory over Holland seemed to sum up their scrappy, resolute run to the final. \u201cA football game is just about 90 minutes. If you concede some goals and you try to score as soon as possible, you concede space at the back and you are finished. It was a lesson for us, the Brazil game.\u201d As tens of thousands of Argentinians were expected to flood into Rio, many setting up camp in the city\u2019s iconic Sambadrome, the Manchester City full-back said that Sabella\u2019s side would take inspiration from the massive patriotic support. \u201cYou can see how the Argentina fans are excited, singing for 90 minutes. It\u2019s special for us to play in this country,\u201d said Zabaleta of the hordes of rowdy supporters that have followed them around Brazil. Most of the neutrals in the Maracan\u00e3 on Sunday will be backing Germany but Zabaleta said they had also drawn inspiration in adversity. \u201cEspecially because Brazilian fans have been against Argentina for this World Cup. Sometimes, if you have all the people against you, you feel even stronger. I think we showed that and we feel very proud,\u201d he said. Describing how they had been \u201cvery compact\u201d, \u201cvery tight\u201d and successful in \u201cclosing down the space\u201d to deny Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie, Zabaleta gave an insight into how they would approach Germany\u2019s rampant, fluid attack. He inevitably pinpointed Lionel Messi as the key player if they are to overcome a German side who thrashed the hosts 7-1 in a result labelled \u201calmost a national tragedy\u201d by Rio\u2019s mayor, Eduardo Paes, on Friday. \u201cHe is our main player, he is the captain of this team, he is the leader of this group of players,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can imagine how special it would be for Messi to lift the cup. We need to keep our feet on the ground at the moment.\u201d But if Argentina need the Messi who dragged his side through the group stages rather than the anonymous figure who strolled through their victory on penalties over Holland, then Zabaleta also pinpointed Javier Mascherano as a key inspiration. Playing as a holding midfielder, the Barcelona player was his side\u2019s heartbeat against Belgium and Holland, majestic in his timing and positioning as he helped stiffen a hitherto shaky Argentinian rearguard. \u201cYou always need a player with his commitment, his leadership. He\u2019s always thinking about the group,\u201d said Zabaleta. \u201cIf he sees someone who is tired he is there to help you. I have no words to describe how good Mascherano has been for this team in this World Cup.\u201d Before the Belgium quarter-final Mascherano delivered a rousing dressing-room speech to the players and against Holland his pivotal last-ditch tackle on Robben in the final minutes of normal time was key. Zabaleta described Mascherano as the team\u2019s \u201cleader\u201d on the field. \u201cHe is not just a player, he is like a manager on the field. He is always talking about other players, positions, tactics,\u201d he said. \u201cI am very proud for him. He\u2019s been in another two World Cups and been out in the quarter-finals but now he has a chance to win it.\u201d Sabella\u2019s agent, Eugenio L\u00f3pez, told FM Delta in Argentina that the former Sheffield United player would step down after the tournament in Brazil. The 59-year-old, who has faced down intense media pressure to lead his side to the final, has coached Argentina since 2011. \u201cTo go at the top is always positive. I believe he gave everything to the national team and that now is the time to give way to another person,\u201d said L\u00f3pez. Zabaleta said they would give everything to deliver a victory that those pouring over the border in their thousands and millions more at home would never forget. \u201cYou can imagine people from Argentina selling their cars to be here, even without tickets. This is something that happens in Argentina. We love football,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know how special it would be for this country to win another World Cup. But obviously we appreciate how Argentinian fans are doing everything to support the team. As a player I feel very proud, everyone feels very proud. Hopefully we can give them another trophy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
