While not opposed to top-up fees themselves, they wrote, flat rates would ensure equal access to quality education. They argue that variable rates would mean that \"universities that serve students from less well-off backgrounds will not be able to command significantly higher fees.\" They argue that variable fees would reinforce the existing bias in resource distribution among institutions, causing the socio-economic divide in university education to widen. They wrote: \"It is a retrograde step which will reinforce elitism, adversely affect widening participation and result in a two-tier system of higher education that will seriously disadvantage the majority of undergraduate students. \"We urge the government to think again and choose an increase in the flat-rate fee on a post-graduation, income-contingent repayment basis.\" The outspoken vice-chancellors are Dr Malcolm McVicar of the University of Central Lancashire, Professor Peter Scott of Kingston University, Dr Michael Goldstein of Coventry University, Professor Peter Fidler of the University of Sunderland, and Professor Roland Levinsky of the University of Plymouth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
