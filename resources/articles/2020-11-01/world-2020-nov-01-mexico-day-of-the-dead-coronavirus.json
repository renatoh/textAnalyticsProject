They built a small altar for two of Jos\u00e9\u2019s siblings and adorned it with marigolds, sugar skulls and tiny bottles of Coca-Cola \u2013 his sister\u2019s favourite drink. Normally, they would spend the night of 1 November here, lighting candles and remembering their loved ones. But this year the cemetery will be closed because of Covid-19 restrictions, so they made their visit a few days early. \u201cI never imagined doing this,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, from the tomb\u2019s shady portico. \u201cEverything has changed in 2020.\u201d Oceans of marigolds still adorn Mexican boulevards, sugary pan de muerto is still on sale and images of skeletons decorate everything from store windows to billboards. But the Covid-19 pandemic has upended Day of the Dead plans. The effusive celebrations of recent years \u2013 parades inspired by the James Bond movie Spectre and \u201cmega\u201d altars in town squares \u2013 have been cancelled or made virtual. Cemeteries across the country have been ordered to close, forcing many families to mark the occasion at home. Mexico\u2019s coronavirus death toll stands at around 90,000, but officials admit that the true figure may well be at least 50,000 higher. The pandemic has shattered thousands of Mexican families \u2013 but it has also interrupted many of the country\u2019s traditional ceremonies for commemorating the dead: churches have been closed; wakes cancelled; and communities unable to gather for novenas \u2013 prayers offered for nine consecutive days. Families who have lost loved ones in the pandemic have also suffered a social stigma in a country where conspiracy theories over coronavirus and its transmission have swirled. \u201cThey say it was diabetes, or they died of a heart attack \u2026 or it was kidney problems,\u201d Father Ra\u00fal V\u00e1zquez, a Jesuit priest, said, describing how relatives of Covid victims refer to the cause of death. \u201cThey\u2019re scared of being rejected by their neighbours.\u201d The inability to properly commemorate loved ones has left many Mexicans still searching for closure. \u201cDeath has a festive side in Mexico. But there\u2019s also a very human side of deep pain. And the pain of death during the pandemic hasn\u2019t had a place to be expressed,\u201d said Abraham Villavicencio, a gallery curator in Mexico City, who studies Day of the Dead. As in other countries, coronavirus victims are often cremated instead of interred. Cemeteries have limited access, preventing large family funerals and the mariachi bands that traditionally accompany them. When Sandra \u00c1guila\u2019s husband, Ra\u00fal, died of Covid-19 in June, she received a box of ashes from the funeral home and watched via Facebook as a priest offered prayers for multiple pandemic victims. \u201cIt was very cold, very devastating,\u201d recalled \u00c1guila, in her home in the Xochimilco neighbourhood of Mexico City. She still planned to construct an altar on Sunday night, but will keep it small and adorned with simple items: fruit, chocolate skulls with her husband\u2019s name and calabaza en dulce \u2013 a traditional dish of pumpkin cooked in syrup. \u201cMoney\u2019s pretty tight,\u201d said \u00c1guila, a teacher. \u201cThis festival was always so beautiful, but it\u2019s going to be pretty quiet this year.\u201d \u00c1guila\u2019s community of San Gregorio Atlapulco, is famed for its marigolds, which have been grown on manmade islands known as chinampas since pre-Columbian times. Normally they are harvested in time for the Day of the Dead, but this season, sales have crashed, leaving greenhouses full of rotting flowers. \u201cWe used to sell everything and prices would increase as the Day of the Dead approached,\u201d said flower farmer Roberto de los Santos, who figured his sales would plunge 60% this year. In recent years, the Day of the Dead has become big business in some parts of Mexico. Michoac\u00e1n, a state to the west of Mexico City, drew thousands of tourists to sites such as the island of Janitzio where the indigenous Pur\u00e9pecha people celebrate rites with boats full of flowers and candles. \u201cWe broke records in 2019,\u201d boasted Roberto Monroy, the tourism secretary in Morelia, the state capital. \u201cWe also broke records in 2020 \u2013 just the wrong records,\u201d he added. Some 55,000 visited the city\u2019s municipal graveyard last Day of the Dead. This year, the cemetery was closed on 30 October. Beforehand, long lines formed outside as people armed with buckets and brooms and clutching bouquets of marigolds waited to decorate their relatives\u2019 graves. Only two people per family were allowed in; children, musicians and fresh food for offerings were banned. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of sad, just like all of this year,\u201d said Karla Tejada, a jewellery seller, as she placed marigold petals on the grave of two uncles, along with a bottle each of Coca-Cola and Victoria beer. \u201cIt will be different, but we\u2019ll celebrate at home,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
