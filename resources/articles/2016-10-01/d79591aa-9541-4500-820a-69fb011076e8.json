This result, coupled with a 1-1 draw at home against Lithuania in Glasgow on Saturday, means Scotland have taken only four points from three World Cup qualifying games. \u201cAt this moment the people I feel sorry for are the players, they put so much work in the last couple of games,\u201d Strachan said. \u201cThey are the ones I feel sorry for, they are the ones I am wondering how do I protect them. How do we send them back to clubs feeling good about themselves? They can\u2019t go back thinking they could do any more. I am proud of them as a group. \u201cThe second group I feel for is the supporters who have come here tonight. You feel for them. That is what we are thinking about right now. I am not sitting here thinking about myself. \u201cIt\u2019s these lads and how we look after them and how in the future we can give the supporters something to sing and dance about away from home. That is what we are concerned about. That is where our concentration lies.\u201d When pressed on his own position, Strachan was again circumspect. \u201cEvery time I get together with the players they rejuvenate me,\u201d he said. \u201cI repeat, at the moment we have given it our best shot, tried to pick the right side. \u201cRight now it\u2019s how we look after them [the players]. How do we speak to them on the bus going back? I can\u2019t get any more in terms of effort, I am happy with the response every time we get together.\u201d Scotland\u2019s next game is at Wembley on 11 November against England. \u201cWe are looking at it as another opportunity to get three points,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at the table, we\u2019d like to be better off. We are one point off a play-off place. It is a crazy group. Reflecting on the Slovakia match, Strachan rightly pointed to the referee\u2019s failure to award a free-kick to Scotland in the lead-up to the opening goal. \u201cI was sitting there thinking \u2018I like this,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen a decision goes against us. I thought \u2018That\u2019s not fair on these guys. They are playing well and playing against a more physical side.\u2019 Just when we needed a break, it goes against them. \u201cThen the second goal made a big difference They [Slovakia] went from being laborious to being strong. It was uphill after that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
