From next April tens of thousands of people living in social housing will have to find more money to pay for their accommodation or leave their homes. Tenants will have their housing benefit cut by \u00a340 a month if they have a spare room and by \u00a370 if they have two spare rooms. Alternatively, they can opt to be rehoused if they cannot afford to make up the shortfall from their own pockets or decline to do so. However, many housing associations warn they have a dearth of suitable homes to rehouse the near 100,000 tenants who have received letters informing them that they may have to switch to smaller properties. Iain Sim, chief executive of Coast &amp; Country, one of the largest housing companies in the north-east of England, said it had 2,500 \"under-occupiers\" but only 16 spare one-bedroom homes on its books. \"We are very concerned about this issue and the impact it will have on our tenants,\" Sim said. \"This will undoubtedly have a negative effect on tenants' quality of life and potentially push more people into poverty.\" Paul Fiddaman, chief executive of Cestria Community Housing, said his company had 850 working-age under-occupying tenants. \"Of these, 480 are in receipt of housing benefit. If all of these tenants are to lose a portion of their housing benefit there will be an annual additional payment required from our tenants of nearly \u00a3300,000.\" Under the new rules, children of the same sex will be required to share a room up to age 16, while those of different sex will have to share up to age 10. \"These rules are futile and unfair,\" said Monica Burns, north-east manager for the National Housing Federation, which represents England's housing associations. \"Housing associations in the north-east have always been encouraged by government to build bigger homes so families could live in the same homes for life.\" Burns warned the welfare bill could rise as social housing tenants migrated to the private sector. \"The government will then have to pay a higher rate of housing benefit to cover their rents for smaller homes,\" Burns said. \"These are the consequences of a blanket policy that failed to listen to local people.\" Margaret Smith, 60, who has lived in the same housing association property in Durham all of her life and lost her job in 2000 when a local factory closed, said: \"I can't afford to pay an extra \u00a310 or \u00a315 a week \u2013 I've just turned 60 and I'm scraping by as it is.\" The Department for Work and Pensions estimates some 50,000 households will be affected, but denies that large numbers of people will be forced to move. A DWP spokesman said there would be a \u00a3190m fund to help vulnerable tenants. \"It's not fair for people to live in homes that are too large for their needs when in England alone there are around five million people on the social housing waiting list,\" he said. New figures show that over the last year there has been a 61% rise in the number of households with children living in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, up from 1,660 to 2,339."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
