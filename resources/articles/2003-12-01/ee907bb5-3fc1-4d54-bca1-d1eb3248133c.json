With Mr Paisley threatening to sack any of his Democratic Unionist party who so much as spoke to the party he refers to as \"Sinn F\u00e9in/IRA\", today's talks were unlikely to unlock the stalemate. However, by lunchtime Mr Murphy was able to confirm that a commission monitoring the Good Friday agreement and paramilitary ceasefires should be fully operational in the new year. After a meeting with the four-member commission, Mr Murphy said: \"I believe the independent monitoring commission will play a crucial role in the coming months as guarantors of the good faith of all those involved in making progress in Northern Ireland. \"The commission has already been working hard to establish its methods and legislation has already passed through parliament. \"Parallel legislation will soon come before the Irish parliament and we expect that the independent monitoring commission will be fully operational early in the new year.\" The commission will monitor paramilitary ceasefires as well as whether the British and Irish governments and political parties are honouring their pledges under the agreement. It will report on the IRA and loyalist ceasefires every six months and scrutinise the government's programme for scaling down military bases. Commission members will also probe accusations that political parties are threatening the stability of devolved institutions. The idea arose out of peace process proposals from the British and Irish governments earlier this year. The four-man team consists of former Northern Ireland assembly Speaker, Lord Alderdice; Richard Kerr, a former deputy director of the CIA; Commander John Grieve, former head of the Metropolitan Police's anti-terrorist squad; and retired Irish civil servant Joe Brosnan. Speaking ahead of the talks, Mr Paisley warned Tony Blair not to \"buy us nor beat us nor break us\" with bribes or compromises into negotiating with Gerry Adams' party. He told the BBC: \"I don't accept the principle that we must sit down with armed terrorists who have enough weapons in their possession to blow up the whole of Northern Ireland. \"The British government can neither buy us nor beat us nor break us, because it is a democratic principle that we don't engage with armed terrorists to find a solution to a situation like this. \"Men in my party are principled people who have put down their lives on this issue and they are not going to be bought or borrowed or got at by anyone. If anybody wanted to do that, the party would immediately take action to remove them.\" Asked if he could accept the title of first minister, Mr Paisley said: \"Not with IRA/Sinn F\u00e9in in government.\" He added: \"I believe we have a golden opportunity now to have this matter settled once and for all. \"If you are going to take part in the government of Northern Ireland, you can't have an armed army to use in blackmailing the British government and trying to get more concessions.\" Earlier, Sinn F\u00e9in - now the biggest party representing Catholic nationalist opinion - urged the Democratic Unionists to respect the democratic legitimacy of the assembly, 70% of whose members, they said, were in favour of the Good Friday agreement. The party's Alex Maskey, former mayor of Belfast who was elected to the suspended assembly last week, said Mr Paisley could not be allowed to renegotiate the Good Friday agreement. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"70% of the elected representatives are from pro-agreement parties. \"The Good Friday agreement is a treaty between two governments and has been endorsed by a referendum in Ireland as a whole, so it is not something that can be tinkered with. \"A new agreement would require a new treaty and a referendum. It's not a matter for one party to say they will turn that agreement on its head. The DUP must realise that they can't usurp the will of the people.\" Quite how a way out of the deadlock can be found is unclear. Northern Ireland is still being ruled directly from London while the Stormont assembly is suspended. The cross-party consensus rules on which the assembly was founded require that the leaders of the largest parties from the unionist and nationalist communities take the roles of first minister and deputy. That was a fraught enough marriage of convenience when David Trimble's UUP and John Hume's SDLP were the victors. Now that the pairing is Mr Paisley and Mr Adams, it is a non-starter, despite peace offerings from Sinn F\u00e9in. The DUP's deputy leader, Peter Robinson, fired a shot across the bows of any attempt by London to call new elections. He said: \"I think it is a nonsense to suggest that the prime minister, having had one black eye after last week's election, would go for another. \"You can imagine how the unionist electorate would react were he to say that we had to have another election because he did not like how they voted.\" Mr Robinson was commenting as the DUP's 30-strong assembly team prepared to hold its first meeting at Stormont. Mr Trimble was also holding his first meeting of his new assembly group, which included more critics of his policies. Rebel Ulster Unionist MPs Jeffrey Donaldson and David Burnside were expected to take part in their first meeting as assembly members. However, supporters of Mr Trimble were bullish ahead of the showdown, insisting the rebels would be told to toe the line or quit the party."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
