City\u2019s manager gave Hart a first start of the season, having dropped him as the side\u2019s No1 goalkeeper, and also made him captain. The fans showed their support throughout the match and at one point Hart almost seemed moved to tears. However the Barcelona goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who flew into Manchester on Tuesday, is expected to sign and become Hart\u2019s replacement. Asked about his future Hart, 29, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to say. It is what it is. You probably know better than me.\u201d Hart has been demoted because Guardiola believes that he is not accomplished enough at playing the ball out with his feet. When it was put to Hart that he had a 100% pass completion rate against Steaua, the England international responded: \u201cWell pigs do fly, don\u2019t they?\u201d With regard to whether he has been judged too soon, Hart added: \u201cIt\u2019s a situation, we have a top manager that the club has wanted for a long, long time and he will have his opinion on things and outside of the charade and all the rubbish that is being talked, we are dealing with it like men inside and we will come up with a solution. Tonight I played for Man City and I enjoyed it and I have done every time I have played for Man City.\u201d Guardiola has stated he had no doubt about his decision to drop Hart despite the player\u2019s distinguished history at the club he joined from Shrewsbury Town in 2006 for an initial \u00a3600,000. \u201cI am here to take decisions. I make a lot of mistakes,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cSome good and some bad, but I try to be honest. I can\u2019t deny what I feel. I was honest with Joe and all the players in the squad. Joe right now is a player for Man City and if he has to play he will play. I am so happy that today he played at the level he has. \u201cJoe is still a player for us. I know he is a legend for this club. One of the reasons the club is what it is. I know he helped make this team one step above, so I am so happy the players treat him like this and love him.\u201d Guardiola was unsure if Bravo would receive a good reception from the Manchester City fans when he first plays. \u201cI don\u2019t know. They can express what they feel,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like all my decisions to make everyone happy but it is impossible. You have to take a decision to impact on the life of the players. We have 28 players: 17 cannot play. \u201cFrom the beginning I arrive here with a lot of information and I analyse. I have to take a decision and I cannot deny what I feel. If the fans are not happy I can understand. He has done more than I might do at this club. These guys like [David] Silva, Yaya [Tour\u00e9] make this club how it is. \u201cIt\u2019s not a club with European history. I am here and I must take a decision. The people, some will agree and some will not. I\u2019m not always right but I have to take the decision. That\u2019s why City asked me to be the new manager.\u201d Hart said that he had been touched by the support he had received from the City supporters during a match that was won by a Fabian Delph\u2019s second\u2011half header which gave them a 6-0 aggregate victory. \u201cThat was a really special night for me,\u201d Hart said. \u201cI have had a lot of good nights going on but I feel that inside, outside of all the circus, we are handling it well as a good team with a good management staff, and I enjoyed tonight. \u201cIt is a place I love to be but situations occur in football but we are men, we get on with it. I really appreciate the people of Man City and it turns out they appreciate me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
