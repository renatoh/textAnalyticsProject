It has sun-kissed beaches, lush rainforest, and incredible diving, together with the finest French cuisine outside of France \u2013 and that\u2019s before you even leave the main island of Grand Terre. Less than three hours flight from the east coast of Australia, New Caledonia feels like a piece of France broke off from Europe and floated to the South Pacific. Yet, thanks to its proud Melanesian heritage and influence, it offers a unique experience entirely of its own. From flying above the famous Heart of Voh to exploring the depths of a sunken naval ship, here are five incredible New Caledonian experiences worth adding to your bucket list. 1. Sail an outrigger at the Isle of Pines From the stark white sands of Ouv\u00e9a to the steep cliffs and emerald forests of Mar\u00e9, New Caledonia\u2019s outer islands are as beautiful as they are diverse. One in particular, however, has become a bucket list destination in itself \u2013 the dazzling Isle of Pines (Ile de Pins). Just 20 minutes flight from Noum\u00e9a, or two and a half hours by ferry if you want the scenic route, the Isle is a fixture on almost every travel lover\u2019s Insta-feed. Towering conifers, sacred coral islands and waters brimming with vibrant reefs to explore\u2026 it deserves all the praise. When you visit, there is one experience all but guaranteed to take things to the next level: sailing on Upi Bay aboard a traditional pirogue outrigger canoe. As you tack and jibe through the bay\u2019s crystal-clear waters, weaving between immense rocks and past curious dolphins, your mind stills, stress levels drop, and you can\u2019t help but live in the moment. 2. Savour the flavours of New Caledonia at sunset The rumours are true. With its traditional French flair, Melanesian specialties and tantalising fusion food, New Caledonia is the gourmet powerhouse of the South Pacific. From Michelin-style gastronomy to authentic Kanak cuisine, exploring New Caledonia\u2019s dining scene is worthy of a bucket list point of its own \u2013 and it isn\u2019t only limited to the restaurants. Noum\u00e9a is brimming with delicatessens, wine cellars and produce markets to explore, each stocking locally made and imported delights. For something truly special, swing by the famous Port Moselle Markets for picnic supplies, grab a bottle of delectable French wine from the cellar at La Cave, and then settle in for a beachside sunset at Baie de Citron. Another equally stunning picnic location is the lookout at Ouen Toro Hill, which offers 360-degree views across Noum\u00e9a and the surrounding islands. At sunset, it\u2019s truly magical. 3. Explore the depths on a sunken ship The landscapes of New Caledonia are incredibly diverse. A short drive on the main island of Grand Terre will take you from vast beaches to lush rainforest, through misty mountains and on to golden grasslands. Yet, there is another which deserves your attention too, and it\u2019s accessible only to those who seek it \u2013 beneath the water\u2019s shimmering surface. One of the South Pacific\u2019s premier scuba diving destinations, New Caledonia is home to a myriad of renowned sites including the Prony Needle, the soft coral \u201cforests\u201d of Poindimie, and the shipwreck of La Dieppoise. Many sites can be easily accessed from Grand Terre. With an average depth of 25 metres, the New Caledonian Barrier Reef and its spectacular 24,000 square kilometre lagoon, which is the world\u2019s largest, offer the ideal conditions for all scuba and snorkelling skill levels. More than 20,000 plant and animal species have been recorded within its vibrant waters, including mantas, dugongs, sharks, and a dazzling rainbow of reef fish. 4. Kayak through a drowned forest Not to be outshined by its show-stopping reefs, New Caledonia\u2019s forests and parklands are just as spectacular too. Blue River National Park, in particular, is a 9,000-hectare wonderland of sapphire blue lakes, emerald green forests, and fiery red soils just waiting to be explored. Less than an hour from Noum\u00e9a, the park is home to countless paths for cycling and hiking. Kayaking through the Drowned Forest, an eerily beautiful site of hundreds of bleached tree trunks rising from the lake, is an unmissable experience also found within the park. 5. Fly above the Heart of Voh If there\u2019s one sight which sums up New Caledonia, it\u2019s the Heart of Voh. First published in an image by French photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand in 1999, this natural love heart-shaped formation hidden in the mangroves near Kon\u00e9 has become synonymous with the islands. Visible only from above, the heart is best seen in the same way Arthus-Bertrand did \u2013 from an ultra-light. Taking to the skies, viewing this unique natural wonder in the flesh, together with the mesmerising scenery that surrounds it, is an experience you will never forget. Though bucket lists are often created yet rarely ticked off, the accessibility and affordability of New Caledonia can make your bucket list dreams a reality sooner than you may think.
