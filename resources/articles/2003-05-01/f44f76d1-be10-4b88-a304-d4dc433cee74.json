A combination of their winning the championship and making more appearances than any other club - 22 live on Sky and pay per view plus 13 on ITV1's The Premiership - puts them comfortably on top of the money table. The figures, revealed exclusively here, show just how sharply television income has risen as a result of the last round of deals, which run until the end of next season. It was only two years ago that Manchester United crashed the \u00a320m barrier. Those deals, struck in June 2000, are now under review by the European Commission who say they were anti-competitive and 'tantamount to price-fixing'. This could lead to Brussels ordering many more Premiership matches to be shown live or even the clubs being told to make their own media deals. The Premier League argue that a relaxation of controls on the number of matches shown on TV could have a disastrous destabilising effect on the Premiership. They believe the present arrangement of collective bargaining is the only way to distribute money equitably. jon.henderson@observer.co.uk You can mail the Observer direct at sport@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
