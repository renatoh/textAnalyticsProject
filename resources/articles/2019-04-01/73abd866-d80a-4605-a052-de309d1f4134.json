Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z were among the celebrities who attended the three-hour event in Los Angeles at the Staples Center. The last celebrity funeral held at the concert arena was Michael Jackson\u2019s in 2009. The arena was packed with more than 21,000 fans and drove home the important impact that Hussle, who was just 33 when he died, had on his city and the rest of the world. \u201cMy son Ermias Joseph Asghedom was a great man,\u201d said Angelique Smith, dressed in all white. Standing onstage with Hussle\u2019s father, Dawit Asghedom, she declared: \u201cErmias was a legacy.\u201d London, in dark sunglasses, was emotional but stood strong as she told the audience: \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this type of pain before.\u201d London called Hussle \u201cmajestic\u201d and \u201cbrilliant\u201d, adding that though she was hurting, she was really sad for their son, Kross, whom she feared wouldn\u2019t remember his dad. A blogger, Karen Civil, read a letter from Barack Obama. \u201cI\u2019ve never met Nipsey, but I\u2019ve heard his music through my daughters, and after his passing I had the chance to learn more about his transformation and his community work,\u201d the former president wrote. \u201cWhile most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and only see gangs, bullets and despair, Nipsey saw potential. He saw hope.\u201d Snoop Dogg\u2019s words to immortalize his friend were both serious and silly, as he told old stories about Hussle and their brotherhood. \u201cThis a tough one right here,\u201d he said. Hussle\u2019s father said he knew his son was strong because when he was born, the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck but he prevailed. \u201cHe was a fighter,\u201d he said. Stevie Wonder was the last performer to pay tribute to Hussle, who he said he had the chance to meet. Before he sang Rocket Love, one of Hussle\u2019s favorites, Wonder denounced gun violence. A DJ called the event a celebration, and indeed, Hussle\u2019s mother danced in the aisle in tribute to her son as the R&amp;B singer Marsha Ambrosius sang the Mariah Carey song Fly Like a Bird while fighting back tears. A montage of photos featuring the rapper from infancy, childhood and adulthood were shown to the crowd, set to Frank Sinatra\u2019s song My Way. Singer Anthony Hamilton invoked the spirit of a church service as he performed. The Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan, hailed Hussle\u2019s ability to bring different factions together. Hussle was killed last month at age 33 in front of The Marathon, a clothing store that he created to empower his south central Los Angeles neighborhood. Most who filed in for the public memorial at the arena on Thursday were young adults, but ages ranged from small children to the elderly. \u201cWe\u2019re here for a great man. We\u2019re all here for big Nip. It wasn\u2019t his time,\u201d said Wutup Levy, 27, of Long Beach, California. Daren B Harris waited outside the arena before the doors opened with his grandmother and other family members, who wore black T-shirts with Hussle\u2019s face on them. Harris said he grew up listening to the rapper\u2019s music and followed his journey to improve his community. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime thing,\u201d said Harris, 23, who lives in South Los Angeles. \u201cHe was a treasure.\u201d Harris\u2019s grandmother, Reba Johnson, said she couldn\u2019t miss the occasion to celebrate Hussle\u2019s life. \u201cHe was bigger than his music,\u201d she said. Books with an image of Hussle on the cover were handed out to service attendees. The book of nearly 100 pages contained numerous photos of Hussle with London, his children, and friends such as Russell Westbrook and Snoop Dogg. It also had heartfelt messages from Rick Ross, the Game and LeBron James. \u201cI\u2019ve never cried myself to sleep over any public figure before, but Nipsey\u2019s presence meant so much for our community,\u201d the actor Issa Rae said in her message inside the book. The hearse carrying Hussle\u2019s coffin went through a 25-mile lap through the city, past the property where Hussle had planned to turn an ageing strip mall into affordable homes and new businesses \u2013 including his clothing store, where thousands had gathered. The Los Angeles police department urged mourners to stay calm amid concerns over a loud noise, as emotions ran high. The casket was scheduled to arrive at a funeral home in the city\u2019s hardscrabble Crenshaw district, where the rapper was born on 15 August 1985. Eric R Holder Jr, who has been charged with killing Hussle, has pleaded not guilty. Police have said Holder and Hussle had several interactions the day of the shooting and have described it as being the result of a personal dispute. Hussle, whose real name was Ermias Asghedom, was an Eritrean American father of two. He was a beloved figure for his philanthropic work that went well beyond the usual celebrity \u201cgiving back\u201d ethos. Following his death, political and community leaders were as quick and effusive in their praise as were his fellow hip-hop artists. For a decade, Hussle released much sought-after mixtapes that he sold out of the trunk of his car, helping him create a buzz and gain respect from rap purists and his peers. He said his stage name, a play on the 1960s and 70s rhyming standup comic Nipsey Russell, was given to him as a teen by an older friend because he was such a go-getter, always hustling. He received a boost when Jay-Z bought 100 copies of his 2013 mixtape Crenshaw for $10,000. Last year, he hit new heights with Victory Lap, his Grammy-nominated major-label debut album on Atlantic Records that made several critics\u2019 best-of lists. The album debuted at No 4 on Billboard\u2019s 200 albums charts and features collaborations with Kendrick Lamar and Cee-Lo Green. On Thursday, his family and friends vowed to continue his work, and London told the crowd: \u201cThe marathon continues!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
