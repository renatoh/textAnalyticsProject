Is this a completely nutty scheme, and is it even possible? Emma MacLeod, by email Wonderful idea, but sadly it's impracticable. Four-wheel drive enthusiasts and motorcyclists do occasionally drive through Russia and, except for some impassable stretches of road, it is possible to get from one end of the country to the other. That said, they're usually aiming for Vladivostock, in the South East.Travelling to the far North East entails taking two truly remote road odysseys from Tynda, which is on the Baikal Amur Railway, to Yakutsk and then the Kolyma highway, which runs for around 1,200 miles to Magadan, on the Pacific. This has a gruesome history and is known as the 'road of bones' after the prisoners who died building it. To do these extremely rough journeys you'll need a well-equipped four-wheel-drive vehicle, plenty of off-road driving experience and mechanical knowledge and the ability to speak very good Russian. There is a snag, however: you'll have to ditch the caravan and the dogs. Once in Magadan there is no way of travelling further by land, and there's no sea link with the US from anywhere in the Russian Far East. However, Magadan Airlines (00 1 907 248 2994) flies weekly to Anchorage in Alaska for around \u00a3500 for a one-way ticket. Hawaiian honeymoon We plan to marry next spring or summer, and want to go to Hawaii for our wedding and honeymoon. We have about \u00a35,000 for between two and four weeks. We want snorkelling, swimming with dolphins, trekking and time on a beach. Will our marriage be valid in the UK? Do we need visas for the US, and what do you suggest? Jane Hayman, by email First, book quickly. We've had large numbers of similar questions lately. Hawaii is a popular place to marry and honeymoon, and arranging a wedding should be easy. See www.hawaii.gov/doh/records/vr_marri.html The island of Oahu is a great place for your first few days. You can explore the mix of cosmopolitan development, beaches and tropical interior, but to get a feel for the variety of Hawaii go on to some of the other islands. The Big Island of Hawaii is home to dramatic National Parks, where you can trek over volcanic rock formations and hike to the 13,677ft summit of Mauna Loa. Head to Maui for whale-watching, great windsurfing and beaches. There are dolphins throughout the islands, but swimming with them is illegal, and there are heavy fines for anyone approaching them in the water. British visitors to the US don't need visas for stays of up to 90 days. Contact the American Embassy for more details (09068 200 290). Hawaiian Holidays (020 7001 9130) offer flights, hotels and honeymoons. See www.gohawaii.com for more on the islands. Volunteering in Asia I want to combine a trip abroad next year with a two or three-week placement as a volunteer in Africa or Asia. I have seen some American organisations on the internet. Can you suggest any British ones? Michael Newth, London Two organisations run suitable projects for people wanting to do something different on their holidays. One is i-to-i (0870 333 2332). Two weeks on a conservation project in Kenya costs \u00a3645, excluding flights and visas, but with food, fees and accommodation. Projects run by Earthwatch (01865 318838) include conserving bats in Malaysia, working with temple monkeys in Sri Lanka and restoring Vietnam's forests. Sicilian B&amp;Bs How easy would it be to find B&amp;Bs in Sicily while touring by car? Could you advise on a source for looking up such accommodation? Nashir Bharmal, Bedford If you go between April and June or in September and October you should get into a pensioni (guesthouse) or albergi (hotel) by asking at a local tourist office. They often have English-speaking staff. At other times of year Sicily fills up with visitors. A guidebook is essential, and it's worth looking at the Italian State Tourist Board website. Over to you... readers' feedback In response to Ellen Friel's fears about going to St Petersburg at Christmas (2 November). Let me, as a frequent visitor, reassure her that she need have very few. Of course it will be cold but it's a very dry cold and the snow crunches romantically. Some hotels charge Western prices, but you can also stay for under \u00a324 a night within 10 minutes' walk of Nevsky Prospekt in a place that's relatively basic, but warm, clean and, in its own way, friendly. Certainly she should not find the Russians hostile. A tourist information office on Nevsky provides information in English. My advice is: don't stay in a hotel of international status and price. Why go to Russia to pretend to be international? Use a cheaper hotel of a good enough Russian standard, and enjoy the experience. One guide to the city's hotels, www.hotels.spb.ru, seems to cover most possibilities. The Rus Hotel has character and adequate facilities. Michael Quine \u00b7 We welcome letters. Tom Hall from Lonely Planet addresses as many as possible here. Email travel.tips@observer.co.uk or write to Escape, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.
