If a company can get through it, they're probably in pretty good shape. If they can sail through it with brio and distinction, as English National Ballet do under the directorship of Wayne Eagling, then they have every reason to feel on top of the world. The piece begins with classroom exercises at the barre, then builds in speed and complexity until the full 35-strong cast is flying across the stage with the split-second co-ordination of particles in the Hadron collider. For the dancers, sparely costumed in black, white and grey, there's nowhere to hide; the piece is as ruthlessly exposing of technical weakness as it is demanding of real personality. It was probably this requirement that led Eagling to give Wednesday's first night lead to Elena Glurdjidze. The Georgian ballerina isn't a perfect technician - her fouett\u00e9s are endearingly clunky - but she has a big Russian-style jump, the warmth and charisma to melt the frostiest audience and the experience to work the material to maximum effect. Her cavaliers were Arionel Vargas, whose romanticism occasionally errs towards the Will &amp; Grace end of the spectrum, the quietly impeccable C\u00e9sar Morales and guest artist Zdenek Konvalina from the National Ballet of Canada. Konvalina is a fine bravura dancer but I was sorry to miss Fernando Bufala, who injured himself in the evening's opener, A Million Kisses to My Skin (2000) by David Dawson. This is a fluent and exuberant off-classical piece and a chance for the ENB dancers to cut loose, however briefly, from their ultra-populist repertoire. In the age of Forsythe, Morris and McGregor, however, its seamless conventionality makes it hard to get too excited about. Thomas Edur and Agnes Oaks execute a pleasant duet, well within their comfort zone, but of the nine-strong cast it's Bufala who really compels the eye, knocking off perfectly loaded pirouettes as he surfs the riptide of Bach's D minor piano concerto. Although not even yet a soloist, Bufala was also one of the best things in ENB's recent Strictly Gershwin Wednesday also saw the premiere of Eagling's new work, Resolution. Set to Mahler's setting of R\u00fcckert's poems and exquisitely sung by Elizabeth Sikora, the piece was inspired by Eagling's work with a muscular dystrophy charity. After an inconclusive opening the piece gathers force with a male trio in which several ballets from Eagling's performance days are momentarily reprised, among them Kenneth MacMillan's Gloria and Requiem, and Maurice B\u00e9jart's Song of a Wayfarer. The result - simple, direct, clearly heartfelt - has real poignancy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
