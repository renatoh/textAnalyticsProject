It means each remain six points behind the west Londoners in the race for a Champions League berth before the winter break. Judging by the uninspiring fare on show a freshening-up is required, a point Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r made repeatedly afterwards. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have just come off a 6-0 [win] versus Tranmere, we beat Man City [in midweek]. Wolves had 10 days\u2019 rest to prepare, we\u2019ve had two games on a muddy pitch and at City. Sometimes you get games that look a bit flat.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s decision to field Fernandes from the start could be read as bold and pragmatic: Nemanja Matic\u2019s suspension left the manager even lighter, as he joined Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay on the injury list. The club\u2019s new signing had to wait some three minutes for a first touch, a clearance from United\u2019s area. Wolves pressed via a Jo\u00e3o Moutinho free-kick, an Adama Traor\u00e9 cross and a wild Romain Sa\u00efss shot that was hooked over. Fernandes was positioned as a 10 in Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s 4-2-3-1 and once United settled the impression was of a clever player who was involved with deft touches and bursts of movement. If this United side lack a feisty edge the way Fernandes walloped Moutinho with a tackle that left him requiring treatment showed how. The pass moments later that put Anthony Martial in behind illustrated the No 18\u2019s silkier side. \u201cYou can see he\u2019s a top player,\u201d the United manager told Sky Sports. \u201cFirst half he was getting the ball into feet, Bruno wants players moving in front of him and we didn\u2019t move enough so we moved him further back to give him more of the ball. He\u2019s going to be a top addition.\u201d Wolves, though, have noticed how shaky United are under the aerial ball. Twice Moutinho hit in corners from the right and twice the home side struggled, Harry Maguire, Victor Lindel\u00f6f and Aaron Wan-Bissaka all floundering. The next time Wolves attacked United\u2019s defending became near-comedic. Diogo Jota was allowed to amble around deep in David De Gea\u2019s area, Wan-Bissaka looking on as if he was seated in the Stretford End. The right-back and his team were lucky Jota spooned his cross but this was another warning. The closest United had gone by the half-hour was a Maguire shot from 30 yards that missed badly to Rui Patr\u00edcio\u2019s left. When Traor\u00e9 was teed up before De Gea the wide man had to hit the target, but his effort lacked composure and United\u2019s No 1 watched the ball sail past his left post. As the interval approached Fernandes had a golden chance to pen a headline start to his United career. Luke Shaw rolled the ball to the 25-year-old Portuguese just outside the box. He connected cleanly but could fire only into Rui Patr\u00edcio\u2019s hands. The half ended with Traor\u00e9 outmuscling Maguire, who had to be assisted by Fred. Solskj\u00e6r sent United out for the second half in a rejigged form. Fernandes now sat alongside Fred, Juan Mata became the 10, Andreas Pereira went to the left and Daniel James the right. The game still lacked rhythm, though. Pereira\u2019s tendency to misplace and mistime passes sold Wan-Bissaka and Maguire short and Fernandes had to race back to defend when he too ceded possession. A planned walk-out on 68 minutes in protest at the Glazers\u2019 ownership of United did not materialise. Ed Woodward was not present at Old Trafford five days after his house was attacked. Fernandes\u2019s next act was to pull down Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez and be booked. Better was the new boy\u2019s curving free-kick that Rui Patr\u00edcio needed two attempts to clutch a little later. So, too, to a Mata shot that nearly crept inside the left post. De Gea saved from Jim\u00e9nez, then Maguire threw himself at a Matt Doherty effort as Wolves pressed and Diogo Dalot went close with a late header."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
