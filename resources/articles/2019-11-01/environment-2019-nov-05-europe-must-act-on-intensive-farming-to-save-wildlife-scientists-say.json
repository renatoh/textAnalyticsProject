Five organisations representing more than 2,500 experts have written to Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming president of the European commission, and the European parliament, to demand major changes to the way the CAP operates. Under current rules, farmers are rewarded for the land they farm, and can apply for supplementary subsidies based on implementing measures to protect the environment and preserve wildlife and flora. This system is regarded as an improvement on its predecessor, which encouraged over-supply in some areas by awarding production-based subsidies, leading to the infamous butter mountains and wine lakes of previous decades. However, the current CAP \u2013 which costs EU taxpayers \u20ac60bn a year \u2013 is \u201cturning rural areas into green deserts of uninhabitable maximum-yield monocultures\u201d, according to the European Ornithologists Union, the European Mammal Foundation, the Societas Europaea Herpetologica, the Societas Europaea Lepidopterologica and Butterfly Conservation Europe. There is now an \u201cunequivocal scientific consensus\u201d that the plummeting numbers of European farmland birds, populations of which more than halved between 1980 and 2015, and a decline of more than three-quarters among insects in some areas, have happened because of intensified farming, the signatories wrote. \u201cThe greening measures in the CAP are largely ineffective at retaining or restoring biodiversity and are too often poorly controlled,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe current agri-environmental schemes are both underfunded and insufficiently targeted to meet the scale of the damage to farmland biodiversity.\u201d Proposed changes that would place more emphasis on such measures are still inadequate, the experts found. Instead, they want to see fundamental reforms that support smaller farms that use sustainable methods and maintain high biodiversity. Harriet Bradley, the EU agriculture policy officer at BirdLife Europe, said: \u201cThe scientific evidence speaks for itself \u2013 intensive farming is killing nature. If the CAP isn\u2019t fundamentally reformed \u2013 if we don\u2019t make space for nature \u2013 then Europe\u2019s \u2018Green Deal\u2019 promises on biodiversity and climate will just be empty words on another piece of paper.\u201d In the UK, farmers will no longer receive CAP subsidies of about \u00a33bn a year after Brexit, but the government has pledged instead to offer payments to farmers who meet certain environmental targets, which have not yet been set out. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cLeaving the EU presents an opportunity to design a bespoke agricultural policy and reward our farmers for enhancing the environment, including protecting and improving biodiversity. \u201cOur new environmental land management scheme is intended to be a powerful vehicle for driving this change and achieving the goals of the 25-year environment plan. We are now working closely with a range of environmental and agricultural stakeholders to collaboratively design this new scheme.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
