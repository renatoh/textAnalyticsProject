England are increasingly concerned over the availability of Chris Robshaw and Mike Brown for their game in Rome on Sunday 4 February while Wales, who kick off the day before, may yet be without Liam Williams for the tournament and injuries are inconveniencing the other four sides, too. Instead of parading the captains and coaches at the launch in west London it might have been easier to invite the six team doctors. Including Robshaw and Brown, who have back trouble and blurred vision respectively, England have 18 players on their casualty list with Jack Nowell now confirmed as a non-starter for the Italy game, Henry Slade out with a shoulder problem for a minimum of three to four weeks and Kyle Sinckler out until late March with hamstring trouble. With Maro Itoje also unable to train because of a hip injury and Courtney Lawes battling a flu bug it is possible England\u2019s back-row resources will become even more stretched with Billy Vunipola, Nathan Hughes, James Haskell and Tom Curry already unavailable. Eddie Jones has not yet given up hope of kicking off against Italy with Itoje at six, Robshaw at seven and Sam Simmonds at eight but Sam Underhill, Gary Graham, Zach Mercer and Nick Isiekwe, who have six caps between them, are edging steadily closer to making their Six Nations debuts. One plus for Jones is the return to full fitness of his Lions centre Ben Te\u2019o but once again Six Nations injury stats after a Lions tour or a World Cup make uncomfortable reading. Warren Gatland, already without Dan Biggar for at least three games and Rhys Priestland for the entire tournament, is among those concerned by the attrition rate, with Williams potentially the next candidate for an operation if a concerted rehab programme does not cure an abdominal problem. \u201cIt\u2019s the way rugby\u2019s going at the moment,\u201d the Wales head coach said, expressing his relief that the tournament schedule still has two \u201cfallow\u201d weeks. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Celtic nations could survive the intensity of five internationals in a row and be able to compete against England and France who have so much more depth of numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an attritional tournament because of the big games played beforehand.\u201d Both he and Jones, however, have been around long enough to understand the futility of making excuses. Jones regards injuries as an inevitable hazard \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not Donald Trump, I can\u2019t build a wall between us and the clubs and ring-fence the players\u201d \u2013 and wants England to compensate by being \u201cthe hungriest\u201d team in the competition. \u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t mind other teams being spoken about as the darlings of European rugby, because it gives us something to chase. Are we ever the darlings? I don\u2019t think so. \u201cAll I can remember is that last year we won every game apart from one and people still said our rugby was rubbish.\u201d Following the tentative trial last year the use of bonus points has been retained. France, now under the command of Jacques Brunel, and Conor O\u2019Shea\u2019s Italy would kill for Jones\u2019s problems but Jones remains wary of the Azzurri and their \u201cmischievous\u201d Irish head coach, who claims he already knows England\u2019s starting XV. \u201cHe must have cameras in our training centre,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got more security guys than the CIA and we still find people know our team.\u201d It does not require significant insider knowledge either way to regard Joe Schmidt\u2019s Ireland and Gregor Townsend\u2019s fast-improving Scotland as potentially tricky obstacles to English ambitions of securing a record third title in succession. The tournament may have a new title sponsor in NatWest, while France will host Italy in Marseille rather than Paris, but it continues to be devilishly tough to win."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
