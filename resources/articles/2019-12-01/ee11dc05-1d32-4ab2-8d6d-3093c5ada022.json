Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the former chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons, said the arguments around Brexit had had a harmful effect both on parliamentarians and on society as a whole. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World at One on Tuesday, she said: \u201cThe discourse that we\u2019ve had over the last three years [has] been pretty damaging. Damaging not only to parliamentarians [but also to] the wider community and society as a whole. It\u2019s been very, very damaging and of course I have always believed that the kind of discourse that we had contributed to the death of Jo Cox. \u201cI really believed that then and I still believe it today. So yes, we needed to change the discourse.\u201d When the host, Sarah Montague, asked: \u201cDo you mean the way that politicians spoke to each other contributed to the death of Jo Cox?\u201d, Hudson-Wilkin said: \u201cThe way that we related to one another over this wretched topic contributed. If you think about what the person was shouting when he inflicted harm on our dear sister Jo, you will know that the language that we were using with each other contributed to that.\u201d She continued: \u201cParliamentarians may not be shouting Britain First with a gun in hand or another kind of weapon, but we have to be careful about the way we use language. We might go and have a drink with each other afterwards or a cup of tea or whatever, somebody out there who is not all together there may do something else.\u201d Hudson-Wilkin took up her post as bishop of Dover last month. She is one of 25 women to be appointed bishops since the C of E\u2019s general synod approved the move five years ago. Hudson-Wilkin has been outspoken about the poor representation of black and minority ethnic people in leadership positions and accused the church of institutional racism. She is one of four minority ethnic bishops out of more than 120. She blamed both the media and politicians for the damaging rhetoric in society and said \u201call of us must take responsibility\u201d. She added: \u201cWe can begin to heal ourselves by making a commitment to ourselves and to each other to listen to one another and not just think that your view is the only view.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
