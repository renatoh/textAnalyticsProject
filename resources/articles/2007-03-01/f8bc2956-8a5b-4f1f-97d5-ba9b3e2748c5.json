His players were still enduring a disconsolate warm-down when Wise revealed that Kevin Nicholls, the player he appointed as captain, had asked to return to his former club Luton Town. \"I had a phone call from [Luton manager] Mike Newell, who asked me if I was interested in selling Kevin. I wasn't, but then Kevin told me he'd made a mistake in coming here, that he wanted to go there straight away and help them,\" said Wise. \"I was gob-smacked. There are 10 games to go, he was the captain of this club and you would expect him to dig in like the rest and not jack it in.\" Wise conceded that Nicholls, who was signed for \u00a3700,000 last summer, has no future at the club but ruled out a transfer to their relegation rivals. \"Do they think I am mad, that I am going to loan him to Luton for the rest of the season? Do they think I am seriously crazy, or what?\" Whatever Wise's state of mind, his mantra - \"I have to believe\" - is losing credibility. A home derby defeat by a moderate Sheffield Wednesday gave little indication that Leeds have the will or ability to halt their slide towards League One. Their uphill task became more taxing still after only seven minutes when the defence failed to regroup and left Marcus Tudgay free to head home. Leeds were then floored by a sucker punch: Frazer Richardson lamely lost the ball to Chris Brunt on Wednesday's left touchline who then showed remarkable chutzpah to chip Graham Stack from 45 yards. \"I doubt I'll score a goal as good again,\" Brunt said. \"I was only young when David Beckham scored a similar goal [against Wimbledon in 1996]. That was against better opposition but I'll take this.\" Wednesday were reduced to 10 men early in the second half but they came up with another contender for goal of the season with a fair approximation of the one scored by Brazil's Carlos Alberto in 1970. Burton latched onto Brunt's 60-yard pass and Glenn Whelan picked out Jermaine Johnson who capped off the move with a firm finish from the edge of the area. \"You look at things and say to yourself 'oh my God', because you can't account for goals like that,\" said Wise. \"We were beaten by two wonder goals, and I can't fault my players, who still wanted the ball at 3-0 down.\" Leeds came within inches of stealing an improbable draw, although it took an own goal from Lee Bullen two minutes from time to trigger a late rally. Seconds later Richard Cresswell chipped the impressive Iain Turner for their second and Ian Moore hit the crossbar as Wednesday stumbled towards the final whistle. Wise gamely suggested afterwards that any criticism should be aimed at him, but according to Moore, the players are finding the club's plight hard to digest. \"I've never known anything like it. We need all the players to be together and if your captain is not pulling in the same direction [it is a worry],\" he said. \"We are talking about some of the worst days the club has ever had. Things don't look good at the moment.\" Man of the match Chris Brunt (Sheffield Wednesday) ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
