Elsewhere, as Scott, Gary and John performed Love Her - actually the B-side of their debut platter Pretty Girls Everywhere, but that's another story - the great Internazionale team of Giacinto Facchetti, Sandro Mazzola and Luis Suarez were lifting their second European Cup in the San Siro, Milan, after a 1-0 victory over Benfica. Inter would relinquish their grip on the trophy the following spring after a semi-final tussle with Real Madrid, never to regain it. And who were number one in the UK charts at the time? With a song that could have been written specifically about the Italian club's doomed efforts to win another European Cup? Yep, that's right. All together now: \"Loneliness is a cloak you wear / A deep shade of blue is always there / Emptiness is a place you're in / With nothing to lose but no more to win / The sun ain't gonna shine anymoooo-ooooore / The moon ain't gonna rise in the skyyyyyyy / The tears are always clouding your eyes...\" The time at which Inter will need to get their gamefaces on if this sorry state of affairs isn't to continue: 7.45pm. Internazionale Milano, who are missing both of their first-choice central defenders and are playing the out-of-form/over-the-hill Viera: Julio Cesar, Maicon, Burdisso, Rivas, Chivu, Zanetti, Cambiasso, Stankovic, Vieira, Ibrahimovic, Cruz. Subs: Toldo, Figo, Jimenez, Crespo, Maniche, Suazo, Pele. Will Jamie Carragher mark his 100th European match with a booking which would keep him out of Liverpool's next match in Europe? Reina, Carragher, Skrtel, Hyypia, Aurelio, Lucas, Mascherano, Kuyt, Gerrard, Babel, Torres. Subs: Itandje, Riise, Voronin, Benayoun, Crouch, Pennant, Arbeloa. Referee: Tom Ovrebo (Norway) Five unnecessary letters: \"Sandro Mazzola and Luis Suarez were lifting their second European Cup in the San Siro, Milan?\" repeats an incredulous Ryan Anderton. \"Ah, yes, that San Siro. For a second I thought you were talking about the San Siro, Stalybridge. Still, to manage to link this to two Walker Brothers songs is impressive.\" Others would say tenuous and convoluted, but thanks all the same. Disclaimer: other 1960s crooners are also available. \"I'm still at work in Manchester and have just seen Dave Berry - biggest hit The Crying Game in 1964 - enter the building,\" writes Chris Payne. \"I'd rather have seen Gerry Marsden.\" Meanwhile Gary Naylor is of the opinion that... well, just take a look yourself. \"Don't try to kid us that your photo is of Scott Walker,\" he writes. \"You've photoshopped a pair of shades onto Fernando Torres haven't you.\" Oh Gary! You've been staring at the computer too long without blinking again, haven't you? The teams have run out: The official Uefa bastardisation of the work of George Frideric Handel is blaring out at a rocking San Siro. There's a lot of handshaking going on. There are no Italians in the Inter starting line up, by the way. And we're off! Inter, who were 100 years old this weekend just gone, set the ball rolling. And immediately lose it. 2 min: Inter are on the back foot already, Torres winning a corner down the right. Gerrard whips in a corner which for a minute looks like falling to Kuyt on the penalty spot, but the ball's flicked away by Burdisso at the last, sending it bouncing harmlessly out of play the other side. 4 min: Vieira flings a ball into the Liverpool box from the right towards Ibrahimovic, who from the left curls it back in the general direction of the onrushing Cambiasso. Lucas slides in brilliantly to deflect the ball away for a corner, which will be dreadful. \"Winston Churchill died in 1965 and it was the same year the Canadian flag was introduced as it appears today with the two red bars and maple leaf,\" writes Richard Whittall, treating my Walker Brothers observation with the contempt it surely deserves. \"What does this mean for Internazionale's fortunes tonight? Only time will tell.\" 8 min: What a wonderful save from Reina, who gets down to his right to tip a low drive from Cruz round the post. Inter are enjoying the better of the opening exchanges here. \"Your prematch banter inspired me to give the latest Scott Walker album a listen,\" writes James McCutcheon of The Drift, an album which features Scott slapping away at a side of pork (literally, that's not a euphemism). \"It is terrifying. The nearest football link I can come up with is if David Lynch decided to write the soundtrack to Kevin Keegan's present mindstate.\" 10 min: Maicon loops in a long ball from the right into the Liverpool area; with no Inter forwards anywhere near the ball, Skrtel and Hyypia make a right song and dance of clearing it, clanking into each other before hacking away. Liverpool are looking a tad nervous here. 11 min: An Ibrahimovic free kick 25 yards out is charged down by Babel - who encroaches far too early and is booked for his trouble. The winger is none too pleased with that decision and races up to the ref to remonstrate before being pulled away by Lucas. Ibrahimovic's retaken kick is so appalling it doesn't merit description. 14 min: Inter win their 473rd free kick of the match. After a handy opening two minutes or so, Liverpool haven't got going at all, resorting to breaking up play with niggly fouls. Expect more bookings in this game. \"My grandmother just had her birthday last week too,\" writes Rob Rayburn. \"And from the turn out at the party I think she's in better shape than this lot anyway. Of course she is ten years younger than Inter.\" 15 min: Ibrahimovic races down the right, diddling Aurelio and scooting past him with a backheel over his shoulder. He then follows this up with another backflick, this time a pass inside to Cruz, who is beaten to the ball by Hyypia. Lovely play from the Swede. 18 min: Stankovic tries to beat Reina with a free kick from 35 yards. Have some respect, for goodness sake. 21 min: Liverpool haven't had much of the ball, but they've contained Inter well so far. Not a single gilt-edged chance has been created in 20 minutes of pressure. \"Skrtel and Hyypia look like two frozen statues, or the Two Ragged Soldiers of the song's title,\" suggests Liam Francis Boyle In fact they've played pretty well so far, but any excuse for a crowbarred-in pop reference, eh. 23 min: What a terrible cross from Kuyt on the right wing; he's set clear by a majestic crossfield spray from Gerrard but instead of whipping a ball into the centre where Babel and Torres await, he fannies around for ages until, under pressure from Chivu, he balloons a ball right across the pitch. A total waste. 24 min: Babel is nearly set clear by a lovely long ball from Aurelio, but Julio Cesar comes out of his area to sweep clear. Liverpool are coming into this now. 26 min: A superb dummy by Torres allows Gerrard to race towards the Inter goal. He slips the ball out right to Kuyt, whose deep cross this time is dangerous and wonderful; Maicon is forced to hack clear at the far post for a corner. Which is, of course, wasted. \"The Drift is indeed frightening,\" agrees Tim Whelan, \"but not as frightening as the thought of the inside of Kevin Keegan's head. I reckon it's closer to a musical description of the current state of Port Vale.\" 28 min: Stankovic needlessly gives the ball away in his own area to, of all people, Torres. The striker does his best to replicate the goal he scored against Chelsea at Anfield earlier this season, but the angle becomes too tight and Julio Cesar is able to snaffle his effort. 29 min: What a miss by Cruz! Ibrahimovic's reverse ball takes the entire Liverpool back line out of the game. Cruz is free in the box - all he has to do is roll it across from the left to Stankovic in the centre, and that's 1-0. He decides to go for goal himself but drags his effort across the face of goal and out of play. A lucky escape for Liverpool, because that was terrible decision making by Cruz. 31 min: This is good end to end stuff at the moment. Babel makes Burdisso look very ridiculous down the left, twisting and turning him and sending in a cross towards Kuyt on the penalty spot. The Dutch striker tries to steer the ball into the bottom right corner, but can't get any pace on the ball. And the direction is woeful. Still, a decent move, a difficult chance, and lovely wingplay by Babel. 33 min: Maicon spoons a preposterous ball across the face of his own area. Suddenly Kuyt is free down the right! And what a comedy cut develops from there: Kuyt boots the ball straight in Rivas Lopez's swingers, only to see it rebound off the defender's trousers and into the Liverpool striker's face. Then out for a goal kick. Wonderful slapstick, terrible football. 35 min: Burdisso is booked for a Beckham-on-Simeone facsimile flick which brings down Kuyt. 37 min: A lot of whistling in the San Siro as Liverpool stroke the ball around without ever really going anywhere with it. It'll do, though. 39 min: A bit more possession for Inter now, but they're not doing anything with the ball either. Again, as far as Liverpool are concerned, that'll do very nicely. 40 min: Not for the first time, Gerrard sends Kuyt free down the right with a simply majestic sprayed 40-yard pass, and watches in disbelief as the slowest man in world football faffs around then slaps an aimless cross straight at an Inter shirt. Kuyt really has had plenty of chances to do something, and come up with less than nothing, unless you count his Buster Keaton impression on 33 minutes as something, which I don't. Nothing. 42 min: A brilliant run by Maicon. He gets to the byline and pulls the ball across the face of goal towards Cruz, who attempts a Lee Sharpe against Barcelona in 1993 (or whenever it was) style backflick. He doesn't quite get enough on it, and Reina is able to grasp the ball. Half time: Internazionale 0-0 Liverpool. The half peters out without any notable incidents. Liverpool will be happy with this. Erudite half-time analysis, which unsurprisingly has nothing to do with your minute-by-minute correspondent: \"This game is just screaming out for Yossi Benayoun,\" opines Johnathan Kaszynski. \"Every ball that goes out right is just wasted on that oaf Kuyt.\" And we're off again. Neither team has made a change. \"I see the B-side of the final Walker Brothers single was Shut Out,\" notes Howard Clark. \"Could it be that you have some uncanny instinct?\" Nope. 47 min: Gerrard is booked for sliding in on Cambiasso while chasing down a loose ball just outside the Inter box. 48 min: Vieira is given the opportunity to have a pop from the edge of the Liverpool area, but freezes. The ball's cleared but only Chivu, who loops a ball into the area towards Vieira... who freezes again! Arsene Wenger knew what he was doing when he offloaded him alright. 50 min: RED CARD! Burdisso and Lucas come together under a high ball. The Inter player is slightly late on Lucas, but both players were challenging fairly. However - amazingly - the referee shows Burdisso a second yellow. He's off, on his first game back from a six-game suspension resulting from that brawl against Valencia last season. What a poor decision by the referee. 52 min: Aurelio races forward and takes a dig from 25 yards. The effort is deflected wide right, where Kuyt is clear! However he races in at 4cm/hour, allowing Chivu to come across and close the angle down. Kuyt can't shoot, and his attempt to find Gerrard in the centre is easily blocked. The San Siro has gone very quiet. 55 min: Aurelio is booked for a shoulder barge on Chivu. That was never a booking either; the referee has totally lost the place here. 56 min: What a miss by Ibrahimovic. A terrible square ball from Skrtel is cut out by the big Swede, who rushes clear on goal and... drags a low shot wide left. A terrible, terrible miss. 58 min: Now Rivas Lopez is booked; this one's more of a yellow, though, as he plants a forearm across Babel's neck, flooring him just outside the Inter box on the left. Gerrard's free kick is decent, arrowing towards the top left corner, but Julio Cesar is able to fingertip away comfortably. Meanwhile here's some Scott Walker tinged analysis, courtesy of Jon Yeats: \"When You Get Right Down To It, Dirk Kuyt must be wondering Who (Will Take My Place), as he's just been A Face in the Crowd. If You Go Away from home, you've got to take any chances that come your way. Just Say Goodbye, Dirk. But Come Saturday Morning, I'm hoping I can look back and say We Came Through.\" 60 min: Babel is replaced by Benayoun. 62 min: WHAT A FINISH!!! Internazionale 0-1 Liverpool. Aurelio bustles clear down the left. He dinks a ball across to Torres in the centre, but it's slightly behind the striker. Torres checks and traps, spins through 360 degrees as the ball falls, and arrows an unstoppable shot into the bottom-left corner. That's this tie over, I would suggest. 65 min: Inter look totally defeated; they now need four goals to win. Time for the hep new sounds of 1966: \"Loneliness is a cloak you wear / A deep shade of blue is always there / Emptiness is a place you're in / With nothing to lose but no more to win / The sun ain't gonna shine anymoooo-ooooore / The moon ain't gonna rise in the skyyyyyyy / The tears are always clouding your eyes...\" 68 min: Torres nearly tears clear again with another full-circle turn; he's pushed out wide left but still manages to pull the ball back to Gerrard in the centre. Liverpool's captain tries a clever sidefoot into the bottom right corner, but he doesn't get enough on the ball and Julio Cesar snaffles with ease. 69 min: Vieira goes down just outside the Liverpool area under what is not really much of a challenge from Lucas. Still, this referee probably owes Inter something after dishing out that totally unnecessary red card to Burdisso. Cruz doesn't take advantage, a terrible free kick sailing harmlessly wide of goal and high. 71 min: Kuyt sends Lucas into space down the centre of the park. He feeds Benayoun down the left; Julio Cesar is forced to palm his cross out for a corner with Torres waiting four yards out. The corner is etc, and so on, and so forth. 72 min: Stankovic is booked for pulling Mascherano's shirt. The San Siro is almost silent. 73 min: This is just getting silly now. Benayoun is booked for a 50-50 challenge with Maicon, who responds by grabbing the Israel international by the throat. There have been eight bookings in this game - two for Burdisso, of course - and not a really bad challenge between them. The match has - Maicon's tantrum apart - been played in the right spirit, too, all in all; this referee is having a shocker. 76 min: Inter make their first change of the match, Pele coming on for yesterday's man Vieira. Liverpool respond by preparing Pennant on the sideline. 79 min: [Cuts, pastes] What a miss by Ibrahimovic, who is sent clear on goal thanks to a delicious through ball from Zanetti, but shanks it off his shin over the bar. Wild and useless. He's almost immediately substituted for Suazo. 80 min: Kuyt, who has on the whole been worse than useless, goes off for Riise. 82 min: Inter stroke it around for a while but the sense of futility is overwhelming. 83 min: Gerrard pulls a ball across from the left for Torres, clear in the centre three yards out, but Rivas Lopez hacks clear. Stankovic is replaced by Jiminez. Chivu is booked for upending Gerrard. This is over. \"Ever seen a worse performance by a striker in an important match?\" asks Marie Meyer, who could be talking about Kuyt but is no doubt referring to the hapless Ibrahimovic. 86 min: To hollers of \"ole\", Liverpool play keep-ball for a couple of minutes. Pennant trots on for Mascherano. \"Even as a Liverpool fan, this is terrible to watch,\" moans Paul Done, \"and I fear there will be yellows and nonsense to come which will leave the Reds shorthanded against Chelsea in the next round. Don't lie, you know that draw is coming.\" God help us, Paul. If that's a tie, ITV and Sky should refuse to broadcast it. Uefa should refuse to stage it. 89 min: Riise has a slap from 25 yards, but drags the ball wide right. There will be three more minutes of this. I suggest you spend them reading this: Liam Boyle has found a feature on this season's Champions League in the Abu Dhabi edition of Time Out written by someone called Scott Walker. And that's it! Internazionale 0-1 Liverpool. Rafa Benitez's side have made the quarter finals of the European Cup, joining Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United in the hat for Friday's draw. Inter's fans sportingly react with warm applause. That was a very, very good performance by Liverpool, who did exactly what they had to do. Oh, and as for Fernando Torres: player of the season. Next!
