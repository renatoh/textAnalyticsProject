Patrick Bamford broke the deadlock just after the hour, 13 minutes after Ben Pearson\u2019s sending off for two yellow cards, and added a second with 14 minutes to go to seal a victory that sees Leeds leapfrog Sheffield United, who face Birmingham on Wednesday. \u201cIn the first half we imposed ourselves. In the second half, after the red card, we solved the game more easily,\u201d said the Leeds manager, Marcelo Bielsa. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the performance because all the players played at a high level.\u201d The Blades can go back above Leeds with a victory at St Andrew\u2019s but Bielsa said he was undecided on whether to watch the match. \u201cI am more interested in the result than the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have five more games and we want five more wins. We are playing well as a group and are coping with the pressure.\u201d Bristol City were 3-0 up within 19 minutes against fellow play-off contenders West Brom and held on despite a second-half scare. Josh Brownhill, Andreas Weimann and Jack Hunt put Lee Johnson\u2019s side in charge but it was a nervy finale after Dwight Gayle and Jay Rodriguez pulled the score back to 3-2. \u201cThe first 20 minutes were as good as it gets from us,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cI just wish the lads had let me enjoy it for the rest of the game. Instead, we gave away two disappointing goals. \u201cOverall, I couldn\u2019t be happier. We have beaten three promotion-chasing sides since the international break, which is great for confidence.\u201d Derby remain outside the top six after slipping to a 2-0 defeat at Blackburn, Joe Rothwell and Bradley Dack ending Rovers\u2019 run of three successive defeats. \u201cIf you drop your standards in this league, if a lot of your players are not at their best, it\u2019s hard to win games,\u201d said the Rams manager, Frank Lampard. Sheffield Wednesday kept their own play-off hopes alive with a resounding 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest. A Marco Matias double and George Boyd\u2019s goal leaves Wednesday four points behind sixth-placed Aston Villa. \u201cUnfortunately games are running out but we\u2019ve still got a bit to play for and who knows?\u201d said the Wednesday manager, Steve Bruce. Swansea were convincing 3-1 winners against Stoke, who had two players sent off for fouls on Dan James, the midfielder impressing in front of Wales manager Ryan Giggs. Middlesbrough move up to seventh after ending their six-match losing streak with a 2-0 win at struggling Bolton. Wanderers manager Phil Parkinson confirmed the players and management are still owed their March wages by chairman and owner Ken Anderson. \u201cWe have not been paid and there\u2019s no news on that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scenario hasn\u2019t been addressed. People won\u2019t keep coming into work without the wages. People are finding it difficult to keep the club functioning properly. The lads and the staff are low.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
