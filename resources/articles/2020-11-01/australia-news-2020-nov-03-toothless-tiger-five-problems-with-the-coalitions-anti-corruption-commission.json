Five problems with the Coalition's anti-corruption commission", "bodyText": "It\u2019s been described as a toothless tiger, a \u201csham\u2019 and a \u201cfeather duster\u201d. The federal government\u2019s proposed Commonwealth Integrity Commission (CIC) is copping a shellacking from experts and integrity campaigners, despite being handed an annual operational budget of $42m and seemingly strong powers, including an ability to compel witnesses, tap phones and execute search warrants. So what\u2019s all the fuss about? Here are five problems with the Coalition\u2019s proposed integrity commission. 1. There won\u2019t be public hearings The single biggest criticism of the federal government\u2019s model is that it will not conduct public hearings into allegations of corruption involving the public sector. What does that mean for you? Well, if a federal minister was subject to a corruption probe, you would be blissfully unaware, until and unless it was referred for prosecution. Section 99(5) of the legislation holds that a \u201chearing for the purpose of investigating a corruption issue must be held in private to the extent that the hearing is dealing with a public-sector corruption issue\u201d. Indeed it goes even further. Another section of the draft legislation says that if the integrity commission is holding a public hearing, and evidence arises that \u201cwould disclose information that relates to a public-sector corruption issue\u201d, it must go into private hearing. The body will also not be able to publish public reports on alleged corruption within the public sector or make any findings of corrupt conduct. Critics say this effectively shields the government from public scrutiny. About 80% of the federal government \u2013 including politicians \u2013 would be subject to the strong powers of the CIC only in private. The approach differs significantly from the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac), where public hearings have helped expose corruption scandals on both sides of politics. The commonwealth\u2019s bill does not treat law enforcement inquiries in the same way. Allegations of corruption within law enforcement can be heard publicly. The government, of course, has argued its model will avoid the failings of NSW and Western Australia, where premiers and politicians have been forced from office during public inquiries, only to later be cleared by courts. It wants a court, not the integrity commission, to be the body responsible for making public rulings on corruption. 2. The definition of corruption is too narrow What would you consider to be corruption? Is it criminal behaviour? A politician engaged in an offence of fraud, for example? Or could it also include holding a secret interest in a private company \u2013 undeclared to parliament \u2013 while it benefits from a government decision? Under the government\u2019s model, the latter example could not be the subject of an investigation by the CIC, because it does not rise to the level of a criminal offence. Only a list of criminal offences, contained in section 17 and 18 of the draft, can be investigated by the CIC. Critics say this leaves many types of \u201cgrey area\u201d corruption unchecked by the commission. 3. It sets a high bar to even start an investigation Some of the most extraordinary NSW Icac investigations have begun with anonymous tip-offs from the public, with little accompanying evidence. Under the federal model, this would be impossible. The proposed CIC cannot act on confidential tip-offs from the community at large to begin investigations of corruption within the public sector. It would only be able to take referrals from other agencies, including the attorney general, responsible ministers of certain government bodies and agencies, and parliamentarians in respect of themselves and their own offices. Even then, public-sector corruption can usually only be investigated where there is \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that a criminal offence has been committed. That\u2019s a high bar, which critics fear would restrain the CIC from investigating a range of corrupt conduct, which may not be serious enough to rise to the level of criminality. \u201cYou should be able to get an anonymous phone call to say there\u2019s talk about a fellow named Eddie Obeid ... you should be able to act on that information, you don\u2019t need the threshold,\u201d former NSW judge Anthony Whealy said in 2018, when the government first raised the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d threshold. Public service whistleblowers who approach the commission directly would need to have actual evidence that a criminal offence has been committed to begin an investigation. The commission is also not able to begin investigations of its own accord \u2013 known as own-motion investigations \u2013 into public-sector corruption. 4. It deters, instead of encourages, whistleblowers One of the less scrutinised aspects of the legislation is that it creates a criminal offence for certain people who make unwarranted complaints, designed to cause detriment to another person. The whistleblower will have committed an offence if their complaint prompts action by the commission which leads nowhere, and the person is deemed to have intended to cause \u201cdetriment to another person\u201d and there is no basis that any other reasonable person would have suspected corrupt conduct. The punishment for doing so is 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. The government\u2019s intent is to stop the commission being used as a political weapon. But AJ Brown, an integrity expert with Griffith University, has described the offence as a \u201cdraconian idea that defies the purpose of federal whistleblowing legislation\u201d. He fears it will provide too great a deterrent for some referrals to be made. 5. The attorney general has powers to keep information from commission The legislation also gives the attorney general power to declare that certain information should not be disclosed to the CIC. That power, contained in section 270 of the draft, says the attorney general can certify that disclosing certain information would be contrary to the public interest, including if it would harm Australia\u2019s defence, prejudice relations between the commonwealth and state and territory governments, harm national security, interfere with a trial, or reveal deliberations or decisions of the cabinet or one of its committees. Where such information is certified, the integrity commissioner is prevented from accessing it. Critics say there is nothing to prevent the attorney general from taking \u201ca very broad view of information that can be excluded\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
