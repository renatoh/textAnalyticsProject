Sounds like home and dry to the Eye. It's not unreasonable to imagine the suits at the Football League are already cutting and pasting Rovers into next season's Second Division fixtures - a point from each of their 13 remaining games would, going on past promotions, take them up. What's more, their run-in, with home games against the likes of Darlington and Carlisle, is the envy of their rivals. But don't let anyone at the club hear you say that. Rovers' media manager Steve Uttley says the official line is \"We're in a good position and we've done much better than expected, but nothing's won yet.\" As for the fans, they don't know what to think. Co-editor of fanzine Popular STAND Lucy Burke says \"We seem to be storming it at the moment, but you never take anything for granted at Doncaster Rovers.\" Eh? Why's that? If you're unfamiliar with the Vikings' recent history, imagine a death-defying American roller-coaster and you're halfway there. In 1995, Doncaster were a comfortable Third Division outfit - until June that is, when self-styled benefactor Ken Richardson (a man local detectives later described as \"the type that would trample a two-year-old child to pick up a 2p bit\") hired three men to torch the stadium. The plan was to sell the town centre ground for a huge profit with reputation unblemished. The attempt was bungled; the ground, though badly damaged, still stands, and Richardson has been tried, jailed and released since. In 1997, Doncaster Rovers said goodbye to League football thanks to the kind of form that saw Leyton Orient put eight past them in one afternoon - and looked likely to fold altogether. So what's changed? A heady mix of money, positive community action, money, good management, and more money. Lifelong fan John Ryan stepped in with \u00a34m six years ago and Rovers have been a revived club ever since. Doncaster Free Press sports editor Peter Catt says: \"Ryan is a true benevolent character; he puts a lot of money into the club with no real prospect of getting it back.\" And it's not uncommon for locals to report seeing him walk on water. \"He seems to have this aura around him. He dreams the outlandish and it happens. There's no stopping him,\" says misty-eyed Viking Supporters Co-Operative chairman Andy Liney. What you're saying is, they've bought success. Not at all. Dave Penney's transition from player to rookie-manager played a large part. \"He's turned out to be an astonishingly good young manager,\" says Liney. Penney has done with \u00a3120,000 what Hull spent twice as much to do, and the players are right behind him. As Lucy Burke says: \"He came from the squad and he understood the club, he has exactly the right attitude.\" Faced with the prospect of losing their club altogether, the folk of Doncaster rediscovered their love for the team, and John Ryan saw his enthusiasm (which at times borders on the insane) mirrored on the terraces - which always helps when you're handing over thousands of pounds every month. The sound of a heavy iron door being closed behind Richardson didn't hurt either - Rovers' gates actually increased after their relegation to the Conference. And on the pitch? We've heard the name Michael McIndoe being spoken in hushed, excited tones up in South Yorkshire, so has he been the key player this season? They don't like talk of a star player in these parts. Steve Uttley says: \"It is an all-round team effort, there's a great team spirit. You can't pick a man-of-the-match half the time - there's no one player who pulls the team with them.\" Indeed. Ask anyone who follows Rovers week in, week out, and the list of players deserving a mention amounts to a five-a-side team: Andy Warrington in goal, a solid defensive partnership of Steve Foster and Mark Albrighton and midfielder John Doolan sit behind a strikeforce which has been casting fear into the hearts of defenders throughout the Third Division. Leo Fortune-West, a canny free-transfer from Cardiff, and Gregg Blundell, a \u00a325,000 bargain from Northwich Victoria, have scored 28 goals between them this season. That said, McIndoe has been vital in the creative midfield role since signing from Yeovil last summer, scoring 10 goals and creating countless others. There's also been tell of a new \u00a320m, 10,000-seater stadium. That'll help, won't it? Ironically it will probably be the sight of Belle Vue being razed to the ground that will finally banish all thoughts of the dark Richardson era. And if you believe John Ryan, the new Doncaster Community stadium will spring up in 2006 to play host to First Division football. \"Penney's a bit more cautious about their chances, but the ambition at the club, for John, has always been to take the club to the First Division\" says Catt. But while the manager is careful to exercise the normal caution, the fans are already imagining rubbing shoulders with their First Division neighbours. \"I can't see why we can't become a successful First Division side like Rotherham. We'll have a better stadium than them, a better financial set-up, and bigger fan base, and they've survived in that division for several seasons now\" says Liney. First Division it is, then. But even the second will mean new players won't it? Well, Rovers have more than survived their first season in the Third Division with \"a Conference squad,\" who are currently enjoying hero status on the streets of Doncaster, and the fans won't want to see them all disappear. \"They're the players that brought us up. I'd say 99% of fans would rather see us progress slowly but surely, just picking up a few players as we go along,\" says Burke. And though Ryan has already marked May 2005 as promotion day in his diary, Penney is a slowly-but-surely man himself. \"Dave's already looking at a few players,\" says Uttley. \"Whenever you move up you lose a few players. But there won't be wholesale change at Belle Vue.\" So who would they like to sign? Rovers fans know better than to look at big names - they're enjoying a spectacular season without a single \"star name.\" In fact, Liney calls the side \"the best we've had for 20 years.\" But no team is perfect and if Penney spends any of Ryan's money this summer it could well be on the right wing. Fran Tierney has been in fine form in that territory for the last three years, but his season has been plagued by injury and he now faces yet more surgery on his knee. \"If we could get a Michael McIndoe with a right foot that would be fantastic,\" dreams Burke. Although with Doncaster Rovers, they don't always stay dreams.
