They seem to be everywhere, their 'for sale' signs in gardens, their offices conspicuous in every town centre. But even though you might feel you're stumbling over estate agents, when you come to sell a property, choosing and working with one is not quite as straightforward. Estate agents, as everyone knows, do not enjoy a shining reputation. Recent research showed that only one in 10 people thought estate agents were trustworthy; 70% thought they were prone to giving misleading information. Contrary to popular belief - 41% of people thought estate agents needed a specific qualification to practise - anyone can set themselves up as an estate agent. Most gobsmackingly of all, estate agents are not regulated by any external parties. Rather, they are 'self-regulating' and can choose whether or not to belong to industry regulatory schemes. Consumer bodies have long been campaigning for official regulation, as only a third of agents belong to a recognised trade body, often leaving consumers with nowhere to go if they have a complaint. For the moment, then, the safest bet if you're looking for an estate agent to help you sell your home is to choose one that belongs to such a scheme, so that you will have some recourse should anything go wrong. Find out which of the agents in your area are members of the National Association of Estate Agents, an industry body that requires its members to adhere to its code of practice (which includes demanding that the agent have sufficient professional indemnity insurance). Failure to meet the NAEA's requirements can mean substantial fines or expulsion from the organisation. Check too if the agent is a member of the Ombudsman for Estate Agents. The Ombudsman scheme aims to provide a free and independent service for people buying or selling property, and members have to stick to its strict code of practice. Many agents will be members of both the Ombudsman scheme and the NAEA. These bodies could be your best chance for recourse should something go wrong. Once you have made a shortlist, you should ask a few agents to visit your property and give you a valuation, or market appraisal, and find out what fees they charge. You will probably have an idea of what your property is worth already from leafing through the local press, and this will help you get a realistic idea of the asking price you should aim for. Compare this with the valuations the estate agents give you. If an agent gives you a far higher than average valuation, be cautious. Never choose an agent purely on the basis of the promise of good money. They might be being greedy, and you can't afford to be - your property is only worth the amount a buyer is prepared to pay for it. Ask them why they think your home is worth so much more than equivalent properties in the area. Similarly, if you preferred one of the agents but the price they suggest is too low for you, discuss this with them. Ask if they think they could market your house at a slightly higher figure, or if there is anything you could do to increase the asking price. The same goes for fees. Try not to be drawn in by the agent with the lowest charges purely on that basis. Fees generally range between 0.5% and 2.5%, but the chances are you will get what you pay for - or rather won't get what you haven't paid for. You will be offered considerably lower charges if you choose one company as your sole agent, but this will mean limiting your exposure to potential buyers. Your gut instinct is important when choosing an estate agent, but so too is the reality of how they work, so ask plenty of questions to find out what you can expect. To begin with, find out how they will advertise your property, whether they have a strong internet presence - more and more buyers begin their search online. Indeed, there are also online estate agents, such as Halfapercent.com, which only advertises on the internet, through a variety of property websites. Ask the agent how they carry out viewings, whether they will show potential buyers around personally, how much notice they will give you and so on. Online agents will usually prefer you to carry out your own tours of the property, but conventional estate agents will often hold keys so that they can show people round when you're not home. Find out, too, how they will present offers. The Office of Fair Trading says agents must give their clients written details of all offers received from potential buyers, promptly, either by hand, post or fax. They should also keep a written record of all offers that they receive for your property. You can ask them not to bother to contact you with offers below a certain level, though. If you have a complaint against an estate agent, if you feel their conduct has led you to miss out on a sale or you think you have been mistreated, you have the right to complain. Begin by following the complaints procedure within the agency, you may find the problem can be resolved quite simply. If you reach a deadlock, though, take your complaint to the NAEA, which can issue penalties and expel members, or the Ombudsman for Estate Agents, which can order an agent to pay compensation if your complaint is upheld.
