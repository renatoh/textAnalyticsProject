The Votes at 16 campaign believes the move would fit into the government's agenda to promote political participation, providing \"a real chance to improve British politics\". At a Commons launch today the chair of the National Youth Agency, Bishop Roger Sainsbury, argued that the reason why young people become \"disconnected\" is because they feel they are not viewed as real citizens. Matthew Green MP, the Liberal Democrat youth affairs spokesman, agreed: \"Young people are passionately interested in politics and political issues, but they feel politicians are out of touch and unresponsive to their needs\". The president of the National Union of Students, Mandy Telford, rejected the idea that young people do not understand political issues, underlining that citizenship education in schools is helping youngsters between the ages of 5 and 16 to become politicaly literate. \"I believe that, over time, young people will regain some of their faith in politicians and elections and show this by voting,\" said 16-year-old Jade Farrington from Staffordshire, who came to the House of Commons to support Votes at 16. Last summer, a study of voter apathy by the Carnegie UK Trust recommended that the voting age should be lowered to 16, and that young people be allowed to stand for selection as MPs and councillors at 18 instead of 21. The same report found that 71% of 16 to 24-year-olds wanted a greater say in decisions that affected them. \u00b7 Votes at 16 is supported by Barnardos, the Children's Society, YMCA England, National Youth Agency, National Children's Bureau, Children's Rights Alliance for England, Liberal Democrats Youth and Students, SNP, London Young Labour, Plaid Cymru, National Union of Students, Article 12, Charter 88, UK Youth Parliament, Children's Parliament in Scotland, British Youth Council, Care Leaver's Association, National Black Youth Forum, Electoral Reform Society and the Carnegie Young People's Initiative"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
