Their office is on the harbour from which the boat sails, 180 20 Poros Island, Greece. Tickets are bookable or available on the the day of departure, refreshments available on board. There is usually time allowed for a stroll round Old Corinth and the round-trip is a truly breath-taking experience. Elizabeth Bewick \u00b7 The best way to go through the Corinth Canal must be by yacht! Neilson Holidays run a biannual Delivery Trip moving their flotilla fleet at the beginning and end of the summer season. They offer a range of yachts from 30ft to 40ft, sleeping between two and eight crew. Contact Neilson on 0870 909 9099. Alison Tyler \u00b7 Travel to either Loutraki or Korinthos by Orange bus - contact Greek Tourism or your hotel to find out where the bus leaves from - and you will travel down the highway for about one hour towards Patros/Patra.You can hire a water taxi at either town, and they will happily take you through the canal. Take cushions to rest your head on; the walls of the canal are very steep and this is the best way to view them. Travel time is about one hour end-to-end through the canal. This is, of course, subject to big boats. While at Loutraki, you should visit the source of Loutraki water, a magnificent marbled hall that is open to the public for long hours. Both Loutraki and Korinthos are resorts with various rates of accommodation. The slow road to Athens takes about four hours; this is the one that travels out of Loutraki, as opposed to the highway.
