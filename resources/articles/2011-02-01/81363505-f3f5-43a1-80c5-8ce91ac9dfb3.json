Neil Lennon's team have claimed 15 goals and conceded only one in their last five games. Their latest impressive showing swatted aside the challenge of Aberdeen for a third time in 10 days. Even the Pittodrie club's manager, Craig Brown, was deferential. \"If I wasn't so biased, I'd say it was a joy to watch,\" said Brown of Celtic's display here. Lennon's team now hold an eight-point league lead over Rangers and attention turns to Ibrox tomorrow night as Rangers use up one of three games in hand with the potentially tricky visit of Hearts. Celtic face their oldest foes on Scottish Cup business on Sunday, the first of three crucial Old Firm derbies within a six-week spell. \"There is a confidence there, not arrogance but confidence,\" said the Celtic manager. \"We are just asking questions [of Rangers] all the time. That is all we can do.\" The Aberdeen defender Andrew Considine received a red card with 80 seconds played. Considine hauled back Scott Brown as he bore down on goal, though Anthony Stokes's resultant penalty was superbly saved by Jamie Langfield. The Aberdeen goalkeeper could do nothing about Gary Hooper's 11th SPL goal of the campaign. Celtic's striker played a neat one-two with Stokes before dispatching a low finish to Langfield's left. With 15 minutes left, Kris Commons' corner was powerfully headed home at the near post by Mark Wilson, who claimed his first Celtic goal and celebrated a first Scotland call-up earlier in the day. Stokes then put the gloss on the away victory with an angled finish, having collected a Hooper pass. It was his eighth goal in six games."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
