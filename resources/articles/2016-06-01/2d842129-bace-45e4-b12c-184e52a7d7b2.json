Rooney\u2019s insistence that England needed to develop \u201cthat nastiness\u201d after the World Cup was followed up by Eric Dier \u2013 whose football education came in Portugal \u2013 saying recently that Hodgson\u2019s team needed a more \u201cintelligent edge\u201d when it came to winning free-kicks and knowing \u201chow to wind people up and how to agitate\u201d. Hodgson cited the example of Harry Kane\u2019s response to the red-card challenge from Bruno Alves in England\u2019s final warm-up game, against Portugal last Thursday, when the England striker was felled by a head-high kick but immediately got back to his feet and started chasing after the ball. Other players might have tried to influence the referee by feigning injury but Hodgson praised Kane for his behaviour and does not go along with Rooney\u2019s verdict that England\u2019s \u201chonesty\u201d is a potential weakness. \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s a very hard thing to teach,\u201d Hodgson said, to the question of whether Kane should have stayed down. \u201cI think it has to be taught, if it\u2019s going to be taught, at a very early age to be part of your culture and I\u2019ve said many times that I don\u2019t think it is part of our culture. \u201cHarry\u2019s first instinct, when he didn\u2019t get kicked severely, was to carry on and do something with the ball. Some people might say that\u2019s very laudable, others might say \u2018You\u2019ve got to go down, you\u2019ve got to be cynical.\u2019 But I find that cynicism quite a hard thing to coach. \u201cThe referee still made the right decision and Kane didn\u2019t need to go down on this occasion. There will be occasions \u2013 and I take the point \u2013 when there will be a [possible] penalty but the player stays on his feet and maybe then it will be a very relevant question. But again, all I can say is that it\u2019s hard for me, being English, to start trying to teach people a manner of playing which I\u2019ve never subscribed to and they don\u2019t subscribe to. \u201cI won\u2019t be spending my coaching time teaching players to stay down and feign injury. I want to teach players how to defend better and attack better. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to do with England for four years and will continue to do.\u201d England\u2019s first match is against Russia in Marseille on Saturday and, having never won their opening game at a European Championship, the onus is on the team to hit the ground running. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned more than anything is: don\u2019t lose your first game, whatever happens,\u201d said James Milner, whose seven-year international career will take in a fourth major finals when he appears in France. \u201cIt\u2019s great to win it and get off to a flying start but if you can\u2019t get that win, make sure you are solid and don\u2019t concede late on looking for the winner. \u201cMake sure you get a solid start, at least a draw, because as soon as you lose that first game in a three-game group you put yourselves under pressure straight away. That\u2019s the biggest thing. We\u2019ll go out there and try to win but if we\u2019re solid and make sure you at least get a point, that gives you a base.\u201d The squad, who fly to France from Luton on Monday morning, are expected to visit their Stade des Bourgognes training base in Chantilly, north of Paris, for a light session later in the day as they seek to build on three successive \u2013 if not entirely convincing \u2013 pre-tournament victories. Ryan Bertrand should be involved, having recovered from the muscular injury that ruled him out of the win over Portugal, although the Southampton full-back fears he may have lost his place in Hodgson\u2019s first-team lineup to Danny Rose. While there is a realisation that England will need to improve from that display against Portugal to make inroads at Euro 2016, there is confidence that the squad can step up once the competition is under way. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three wins out of three against different, but difficult, opposition without playing our best football,\u201d said Milner, who earned his 60th cap against Portugal. \u201cWe\u2019ve got gears to go through and we want to peak at the tournament. \u201cWe\u2019re doing some good things, we need to improve on other things and we can definitely play better and improve \u2013 but the squad\u2019s got a bit of everything. We can play a variety of formations, there are players with so many different strengths \u2013 pace, trickery, solid players and more defensive-minded players \u2013 so I think as a squad we\u2019ve got so many options. The manager can pick a completely different team, which won\u2019t reduce in quality but will play a completely different style and fit into that game. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got different options and a lot of players who have had great seasons. The boys up top [Jamie Vardy and Kane] scored 50 goals between them, Dele Alli\u2019s had a great season, Wayne and Chrissy [Smalling] have just come off winning the FA Cup, so there are a lot of players on a high as well, so it\u2019s a good time for us to go into a tournament. You just want those boys riding that wave of high confidence and top form and taking it to France.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
