Both were spied in the background of a scene in Greta Gerwig\u2019s 2019 film adaptation of the classic American coming-of-age tale, in echoes of an incident earlier last year in which a takeaway coffee cup was spotted in the background of a shot in the final season of fantasy epic Game of Thrones. The gaffe was caught by Little Women superfan Madelyn Rancourt, who documented her finding in a TikTok video that quickly went viral. The scene, early in the film, depicts four out of five members of the March family \u2013 Meg, Jo, Amy and their mother, Marmee \u2013 meeting their neighbour, Laurie, who later becomes an important part of their lives. In the background of a shot, atop period furniture, sits a stainless steel drink bottle \u2013 identified as a Hydro Flask \u2013 and a plastic Poland Spring bottle. Fans reacted with mirth and horror on Twitter, with some checking their own copies of the film to verify. On Tuesday, Rancourt followed up with a second video, noting that Gerwig, and cast members Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Laura Dern and Saoirse Ronan, broke down the very same scene in commentary for industry magazine Vanity Fair \u2013 and did not make mention of the bottles. Rancourt said she had seen the film seven times in cinemas, went to a Q&amp;A with the cast in New York, and owned multiple copies of the book. She did not say how many times she had seen the film before noticing the water bottles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
