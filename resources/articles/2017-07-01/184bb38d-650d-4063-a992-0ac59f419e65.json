In a hearing entitled Oversight of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and Attempts to Influence US Elections: Lessons Learned from Current and Prior Administrations, the president\u2019s eldest son and his former top campaign aide will appear before the Senate judiciary committee as further scrutiny mounts of the Trump campaign\u2019s connections to Russia. A spokesman for Manafort told the Guardian: \u201cWe just received the letter and we\u2019re reviewing it. We have nothing else to add.\u201d A spokesman for Trump Jr did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Their testimony comes less than two weeks after it was revealed that the two, along with Jared Kushner, a top White House aide and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, met with a Kremlin-linked lawyer in 2016 who offered Trump Jr negative information about Hillary Clinton. Kushner is expected to testify in a closed session before the Senate intelligence committee on 24 July. In an email thread published between Trump Jr and Rob Goldstone, the publicist for a Russian oligarch, the president\u2019s son was told: \u201cThe crown prosecutor of Russia \u2026 offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. \u201cThis is obviously very high-level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr Trump.\u201d Trump Jr responded: \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say, I love it, especially later in the summer.\u201d He then forwarded the email thread to Kushner and Manafort, who attended the meeting. Kushner, who is a White House official, did not disclose the meeting as required on security clearance forms until recent weeks, raising questions about whether he should keep his security clearance. Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii told the Guardian last week that Kushner \u201cprobably\u201d needs to lose his clearance. When asked if he should lose his White House position altogether, Schatz said: \u201cThat\u2019s the decision that the president gets to make, but let me put it this way: if he were not related by marriage to the president, I think he\u2019d be already gone.\u201d Manafort has long been under scrutiny for his ties to Russia. A veteran Republican political operative, he has extensive experience working in the former Soviet Union and was a longtime aide to the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. As a result of Manafort\u2019s work, he recently filed a belated registration as a foreign agent for $17m in political consulting fees that his firm received for advising Yanukovych\u2019s pro-Russian political party from 2012 to 2014. In addition to Trump Jr and Manafort, the open hearing before the Senate judiciary committee is scheduled to include testimony from Glenn Simpson, the head of research for the firm Fusion GPS, and Bill Browder, an investor who has long been active in pushing for increased sanctions on Russia. Simpson\u2019s firm produced the infamous Steele dossier on Trump\u2019s contacts with Russia, which was first published in January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
