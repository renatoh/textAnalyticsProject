Nor is it like living in fear of Fernando Torres picking up an injury that leaves David N\u2019Gog as the squad\u2019s only fit forward. Unlike his predecessors J\u00fcrgen Klopp is not weighed down by such concerns. Instead Liverpool\u2019s manager has what he might describe as the rather cool dilemma of working out how to make the most of his enviable attacking options now that Sadio Man\u00e9 is free from suspension and Philippe Coutinho is showing why Barcelona targeted him in the summer. Klopp will have terrific fun arranging his forwards. Whom to leave out? Coutinho, the scorer of a stunning free-kick in Saturday\u2019s 3-2 win over Leicester City, looks untouchable. But Mohamed Salah, who scored the opener with a header from Coutinho\u2019s cross, is electric on the right, Man\u00e9\u2019s potent speed terrifies defences and Roberto Firmino knits it all together with his slippery movement off the ball. The extra competition even seems to be stirring Daniel Sturridge, who came off the bench at the King Power Stadium to set up Jordan Henderson for Liverpool\u2019s decisive third goal. Maybe the solution is to restore Man\u00e9 against Spartak Moscow on Tuesday and turn Coutinho into Liverpool\u2019s Andr\u00e9s Iniesta by pulling him into midfield at the expense of Emre Can or Georginio Wijnaldum. Whatever combination Klopp comes up with, Liverpool are likely to score bucketloads of goals. The tougher challenge for the German, almost two years into the job, remains how to stop them going in at the other end \u2013 a weakness threatening to undermine his invigorating attempts to bring the glory days back to Anfield. As Brendan Rodgers discovered in 2014, titles are won by good defences. There is so much to admire about Klopp\u2019s football but Liverpool have conceded 11 goals in six league outings and travel to Moscow having drawn 2-2 at home with Sevilla in their opening Champions League match. The encouraging news is that Klopp is not blind to the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious we concede too much,\u201d he said after Liverpool almost dropped two points at Leicester. \u201cThat\u2019s really hard for me. Usually I\u2019m a really good defensive coach.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s defending on Saturday rather contradicted Klopp\u2019s self-assessment. But his record at Borussia Dortmund \u2013 two Bundesliga titles and an unfortunate defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League final in 2013 \u2013 suggests he can sort it out. \u201cThe main thing for defending is tactical discipline,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know everything about football but I could write a book in the next two hours about which space we have to defend, why, when and where you have to be. When you have to step up. I can\u2019t take a car and drive them out of the box. That\u2019s how it is. As long as not every player is doing it we will work on it. When everyone is doing it I will make sure we are doing it for the rest of our lives.\u201d The worry is that Liverpool\u2019s greatest asset, their endearingly innocent positivity, could conspire against them. This is not a team that looks to stifle after taking the lead. Spoiling is not part of their repertoire. Shinji Okazaki\u2019s goal just before half-time should have been disallowed for a foul on Simon Mignolet but a Leicester response was always in the air. The contest should have been over when Henderson made it 3-1, but Vardy pulled one back a minute later. Then Mignolet, again veering between the sublime and the ridiculous in goal, had to save Vardy\u2019s penalty after botching a clearance and fouling the Leicester striker. There was too much chaos, too little pragmatism, and Klopp knows it. \u201cThe team can keep the game open as long as we don\u2019t close it,\u201d he said. \u201c2-0 \u2013 go, go, go \u2013 3-0 or whatever, maybe 4-0. We changed the rhythm, let them come in. We opened the game for them and that\u2019s not smart. That\u2019s what we have to change.\u201d Klopp felt Liverpool played in the wrong spaces when they led 2-0. \u201cWe played the balls a little bit too late and so they came up. As long as we have a good rhythm and play the ball in the right moment and have good orientation, they couldn\u2019t come in pressing situations. It is not a physical thing. We have to keep our concentration. We have to want to be dominant still. And go on and go on. If we decide to use another rhythm then we have to do it active, not passive.\u201d Down on the south coast Manchester United stayed five points clear of Liverpool after grinding out a 1-0 win over Southampton. Klopp\u2019s football is far more watchable than Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s but United\u2019s manager can point to the table and his medals. Liverpool will continue to look like hopeless romantics until they develop a colder touch, no matter how much their idealism warms the heart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
