But before we go it\u2019s worth pondering what the point of the prize even is. As Jude Rogers noted in these pages recently, there were seven Top 10 albums on the shortlist and six artists who have been nominated before \u2013 if the prize is designed to \u201chelp introduce new albums from a range of music genres to a wider audience\u201d, is is simply not fulfilling that remit well enough. She argued as much on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning too. The industry obviously wants to prop up the album as a format, as a younger generation dissects them into playlists, and that\u2019s fine \u2013 the aforementioned King Krule album is a reminder of the LP\u2019s power. Truly exceptional popular records should of course be nominated. But the Mercury\u2019s audience is essentially passionate record dweebs like me \u2013 their promotion is likely to sell very few extra Noel Gallagher albums, but a lot more by Sons of Kemet. Let\u2019s hope for a bit more diversity and risk-taking from the prize chaired by the head of music at Radio 2 and 6 Music, OH WAIT. Well, maybe now is not the time for snark. Wolf Alice will hopefully break into the consciousness of a few more people who weren\u2019t aware of their work, and that is reason enough for now. Congratulations to them \u2013 can someone find them those Jagerbombs? So the bookies were foiled yet again \u2013 none of the top three favourites won. Instead, the judges went for a band who prove they have really universal appeal: soulful, romantic, angry, laconic, they have ended up in the playlists and record collections of a really wide set of music lovers. You only need to see the almost religious fervour of their millennial fans at gigs \u2013 who, like them, have the radical anti-tribalism of having grown up with access to any and all music \u2013 to acknowledge how powerful they can be. It\u2019s Wolf Alice! The quartet have alighted on a really passionate and yet supremely cool version of British rock\u2019n\u2019roll, that shrugs at what a band is meant to be. Are they dream-pop, punk, indie-rock? Zero fucks are given. They just get on with being beautiful, energetic, vital. Ellie Rowsell looks out of breath and overwhelmed: \u201cThis means so much to pick this up with my three best friends!\u201d Her bandmate Theo Ellis takes over, reminiscing about how a record company exec knocked them back saying: \u201c\u2019You lot don\u2019t look like a band at all - all your songs sound different, you don\u2019t look like each other.\u2019 But here we are - so fuck you!\u201d He asks for a J\u00e4gerbomb before heading back to the stage for another rendition of Don\u2019t Delete the Kisses. Annie says that some years the judges \u201call hate each other\u201d \u2013 not with our Harriet in the room surely! We recap the night\u2019s performances. Mmm, that Lily song. The drum roll is beginning... Annie introduces a montage of former winner celebrations. Baby faced Monkeys, possibly quite high Klaxons, blessing-bestowing Skepta and more. Wolf Alice are the final live performance tonight, playing Don\u2019t Delete the Kisses: a frankly magical song with sprechgesang lyrics from a barefoot Ellie Rowsell (perhaps bringing touches of cult post-punkers Life Without Buildings). Its an anthem for hipsters in love: trying to be aloof but letting your true feelings stumble out in a rush of feeling. Still one of the most unique songs released by a British guitar act in recent years. Energy gang! Novelist does Nov Wait Stop Wait, his club heater that is almost like a bit of UKG toasting. It\u2019s a bit of a lazy performance to be honest, his mic kept well below the vocal his DJ is playing - but his shoutout to his mum and his back and forth with the audience seems to fire him up for a final salvo of the chorus. A reminder that grime can still shake down a crowd, even if it\u2019s been overtaken by the sensuality of Afro-swing in the last couple of years. King Krule performs Dum Surfer, his brilliant, stumbling booze odyssey \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re mashed, we\u2019re mashed ... I need another slash\u201d \u2013 set to choppy post-punk and a guitar solo that wanders around trying to find its mates. His sahf Lahndon delivery works so beautifully, rooting him on the pavements and edgelands of the capital \u2013 his record is one of the great London listening experiences and would be an extremely worthy winner tonight. This parish\u2019s Dave Simpson recently ranked all of the previous Mercury winners in order of true greatness \u2013 for him, No 1 is the very first winner, Primal Scream\u2019s Screamadelica. Check out his selection below. James Blake is way too low down imo. Arctic Monkeys perform One Point Perspective in a specially recorded live performance as they continue their tour in their home city of Sheffield, Alex Turner now shorn of his Bob-from-Twin-Peaks do. Ah, let me count the ways I love this song \u2013 it could have been performed in the abandoned Vegas of Blade Runner 2049, or perhaps a working men\u2019s club in the Red Riding trilogy. Turner grabs a guitar for a solo like a man with something brand new to say, then gets rid like he\u2019s said it all before. Because of the way it conjures a complete world of semi-ironic razzle-dazzle, I think of all the albums on this shortlist, this will be the one that really endures, for all its occasional longeurs. In her beautiful silvery beehive, Lily Allen performs Apples, a really smart choice \u2013 a magically minimal album track looking back sadly at the honeyed days of \u201cstaying in bed all day having sex and smoking fags\u201d, and apologising for the breakdown of that relationship. Bed death, money issues, booze \u2013 the issues stack up, but the song never gets maudlin thanks to its simple syncopated guitar line keeping it up in the air. Lesser songwriters would have smothered this in strings or backing vocalists, but Allen knows that her brand of candour doesn\u2019t require any of that. Certain nominees could learn a lot from it. Nadine Shah, with an incredible thousand-yard stare, plays a blistering version of Out the Way. Her band are reminiscent of PJ Harvey\u2019s bunch of burly blues-rockers, or the Bad Seeds, but their crunchy rhythms are full of post-punk fury. Shah swaggers like a boxer as she wraps her mic cord around her neck, looking close to laughter, tears or madness at the song\u2019s close. The night\u2019s most focused and furious performance. Everything Everything were nominated years back for their debut Man Alive, which set out their stall: math rock-influenced guitar pop with fussy time signatures and dictionary-munching lyrics, but which nevertheless cohered into mega choruses. The formula remains the same in 2018, but with even bigger arena energy, and Night of the Long Knives is a brilliantly nervy bit of almost U2-level silliness. The tinny, delayed guitar solo is a nice drop of anti-rockstar energy. I find it incredibly difficult to listen to more than about five songs of these guys in a row without my palate needing a thorough spritz \u2013 it\u2019s stuffed to the gills with information \u2013 but this could be a curveball winner tonight. Jorja Smith performs Blue Lights, her breakthrough track that is loaded with the anxiety of a police stop-and-search. For me the breakbeat backing to this track is fairly rote, and keeps it from being truly arresting, but there is something so satisfying in the way Smith dances on a balance beam between rap and song. Having reimmersed myself in her album recently, it would be a worthy winner tonight \u2013 though I feel like it\u2019ll be album three or four that really connects. Will she get that far in our hype-machined music culture? People expected big hits from her which she didn\u2019t deliver, but hopefully she can modulate into a different kind of artist. A sergeant, an accountant and a mermaid walk into a bar... Your hostess with ... I can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s Annie Mac, looking \u201c100 emoji\u201d. Jorja Smith, almost certainly wearing Tiffany here, given she announced a partnership with them earlier this week. This will be my one and only designer spot I\u2019m afraid. Wolf Alice having a good ol\u2019 giggle. Lily Allen with a silvery beehive. When asked by our Laura Snapes if she might win, Allen replied \u201cabsolutely not!\u201d, accompanied by hooting laughter. Sons of Kemet next, with Shabaka Hutchings \u2013 a journeyman in British jazz who has played with everyone from Kamasi Washington to Floating Points to former Mercury nominees The Comet is Coming \u2013 getting a big whoop from the crowd as Annie Mac introduces them. They play My Queen is Harriet Tubman. If it\u2019s Theon Cross\u2019s tuba, and its magnificently limber bass weight, that propels their album forward, the sound man at the Apollo is giving a bit more weight to Hutchings here, whose tightly circular sax lines keep the energy ramped up. They spike even further as he hops up an octave for the climatic passages, as the two drummer splash a rampant rhythm out on the ride symbols. Their standing ovation is instant and euphoric! Annie explains that Noel\u2019s band, the High Flying Birds, weren\u2019t able to make it, so that\u2019s why he\u2019s here but not performing tonight. Fair do\u2019s. Instead there\u2019s some VT of their performance of Holy Mountain on Later with Jools Holland \u2013 the big, blowsy, brassy, Roxy Music-jacking stomper of a lead single from Who Built the Moon? Shame that he couldn\u2019t play live, as this \u2013 while basic in its way \u2013 is a big gust of simple, effective songwriting after the faff of Everything is Recorded. Boo! Hiss! It\u2019s Everything is Recorded, performing Close But Not Quite. Bandleader Richard Russell amasses an impressively sized squad, including Sampha on keys, and Russell himself cueing samples and a drum machine. A pregnant dancer flails her limbs around arrestingly. Is that Green Gartside on guitar? Well, as on record, these expensive ingredients turn to ash on my tongue. The central melody is tepid, and the song needs a big Curtis Mayfield sample to get even close to release-worthy. No-one is going to be listening to this album in even a few months from now. \u201cThat looks like a very fun band to be in,\u201d says host Annie Mac. Well, quite, but not to listen to. Florence + the Machine kick things off with a stripped-back, harp-laden version of Hunger. Florence Welch still sounds like someone permanently coming up off a pill, with all the vague, face-touching wonderment that entails. \u201cYou make a fool of death with your beauty\u201d \u2013 for me these lyrics fall short of real insight, and only reach a kind of sixth-form Romantic poetry. But Hunger does have a really strident gospel energy, and it makes for a starry opening to the show. Host Annie Mac thanks Florence for flying in specially. Nadine Shah has criticised the Mercury prize organisation this year, arguing there aren\u2019t enough lesser-known artists in the shortlist. Now the Mercury is actually run by the same company, the BPI [British Phonographic Industry], I think it needs to find its feet again. It\u2019s controversial of me to say so, but I do criticise it for that. It needs to establish once again, what is it that they\u2019re trying to do. Why is Noel Gallagher being nominated? Why are there only two debut albums? Everyone will have their own bugbears about what got left off, but of records that are likely to have been submitted, the omission of Sophie\u2019s Oil of Every Pearl\u2019s Un-Insides grates on me the hardest: this sexy, sad and silly album has a wider emotional range than anything on the shortlist, and daringly does so with the very shiniest pop production. She is at the vanguard of contemporary music and absolutely deserves that \u201cwider audience\u201d. *hustled off soapbox* Still mad about Richard Dawson last year too! *bundled into unmarked vehicle* Among those who are performing, Novelist\u2019s album has flashes of greatness, and his repetitive, sloganeering approach certainly instils lines in your head, but he ultimately has a workaday lyrical vision, and the judges aren\u2019t about to reward grime now the genre has fallen back down the pop-cultural pecking order. You\u2019d hope that Everything is Recorded won\u2019t win \u2013 by some chalk the weakest album on the shortlist, indeed in the history of the prize, it\u2019s dinner party music for coke-bloated 90s relics who have switched allegiance to expensive red wine and edibles; a tame, tuneless collection of trip-hop that conspires to bring the laziest writing out of its excellent guests Giggs, last year\u2019s winner Sampha, Kamasi Washington et al. The man behind it, XL founder Richard Russell, has shepherded the careers of everyone from the Prodigy to Adele and should be lauded for that \u2013 but it\u2019s hard not to feel his inclusion here is a case of the industry nepotistically rewarding one of their own. Despite really strong albums, I can\u2019t see Wolf Alice or Jorja Smith having quite enough pan-panel appeal. Lily Allen\u2019s record is underrated, and giving it to her would be a great redemption story \u2013 she certainly thinks so \u2013 but despite its arrestingly candid lyrics its Caribbean-facing tracks might be seen as too lightweight for this rather grand prize. But former nominees Everything Everything have amassed lots of goodwill after a series of vivid, popular albums, and A Fever Dream has some of their most politically charged and anthemic material \u2013 they could perhaps amass enough champions to push them over the line. Unlikely, but then the Mercury panel are often quite unpredictable. Least likely to win are Arctic Monkeys, who aren\u2019t attending thanks to touring commitments. Given the prize is decided by the panel on the night, they\u2019re not going to give it someone who isn\u2019t there and can\u2019t perform a winner\u2019s number. A shame, because their album is funny, atmospheric and in American Sports has the slyest takedown of Trump this year. Noel Gallagher is there but isn\u2019t scheduled to perform, probably because if you\u2019re one of the most beloved songwriters in the UK who has sold tens of millions of albums, the approval of MistaJam isn\u2019t something you\u2019re particularly coveting. I think even these populist judges wouldn\u2019t give the prize to someone so celebrated, for a solid but not earth-shattering entry in his catalogue. That panel, incidentally, features the Guardian\u2019s own Harriet Gibsone, deputy ed of the Guide, tonight sporting a blue corduroy flared suit that demands I use the word \u201cnatty\u201d. Alongside her are: Clara Amfo off Radio 1; Ella Eyre, she of fabulous hair and Rudimental collaborations (in every sense); jazz champion Jamie Cullum; soul singer Lianne La Havas, killing it with those sleeves; Marcus Mumford of Mumford &amp; Sons, not at the ceremony, lazy; Mike Walsh, head of music at Radio X; MistaJam from BBC Radio 1Xtra; Phil Alexander, who holds down jobs at both Kerrang and Mojo; and Will Hodgkinson, chief pop critic of the Times. Joining them for the first time is Danielle Perry from Absolute Radio, who, in replacing Jessie Ware, perhaps skews the voting a bit more indie. Their chair is Jeff Smith, head of music at 6 Music and Radio 2 and thus the chief driver of your dad\u2019s taste. As chairman of the Mercury prize, David Wilkinson \u201cco-ordinates\u201d the judging, which hopefully doesn\u2019t throw his weight around and make the panel give it to Everything is Recorded. Sorry, some technical issues have meant some of these liveblog posts have become jumbled around. The bookies\u2019 top pick rarely ends up coming good, it must be cautioned: last year saw an odds surge for Glass Animals, replacing Kate Tempest as the most fancied, but Sampha ended up winning for his neo-soul weepie Process. In 2016, David Bowie was predicted to get a posthumous win, but Skepta took it home; while in 2015, Benjamin Clementine beat the favourite, Jamie xx. But it\u2019s worth saying that in all three cases, the eventual winner was only just behind the favourite in the odds, so it could well be that one of the top three wins tonight. Who works this stuff out anyway? Can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s whoever DJs the Christmas party in the William Hill offices: \u201cHere, Darren, which of these musicians is the most likely to win over a panel of industry experts vested in maintaining the mythic allure of the album format?\u201d Second fave is Sons of Kemet, the quartet who have been at the heart of an incredibly vibrant new British jazz scene in recent years. Powered by the nimble tuba lines of Theon Cross \u2013 the musical equivalent of an elephant ably doing ballet \u2013 their album Your Queen is a Reptile is a series of dedications to black female political activists, and the couple of lyric-based pieces go in hard on racism, Ukip and the Tories. If another aim of the prize is to \u201chelp introduce new albums from a range of music genres to a wider audience\u201d, there isn\u2019t a better candidate, and it\u2019s another very 2018 album; I can see the jury wanting to acknowledge the scene around them too. If you held a gun to my head \u2013 hey, it\u2019s just a middlebrow album competition, guy! \u2013 then I\u2019d say they\u2019re the likeliest winners. Yes, it\u2019s time once again for a British album to be anointed alongside the likes of M People, Gomez, Speech Debelle and alt-J as the finest music this country is capable of producing \u2013 it\u2019s the Mercury prize 2018! We\u2019ll be rounding up the red carpet action, then following along with the BBC4 broadcast from 9pm, with the winner announced at 10.20pm. At the ceremony itself is the Guardian\u2019s Laura Snapes, who\u2019ll be pinging through hot gossip in between doing some actual journalism. She has already got up close and personal with one of the nominee trophies, casually perched on a stack of chairs, and resembling something you have to try and unlock in The Crystal Maze. The other criterion for the prize is \u201cto recognise and celebrate artistic achievement\u201d, and the third favourite deserves that: King Krule\u2019s album The Ooz is an absolutely visionary blend of hip-hop, jazz, rockabilly, dub and more, that distills down all the dirt and jangled nerves of London life. Alongside Arctic Monkeys\u2019 magnificent Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino concept, it is the most album-y album: one that works best listened to in full. Beloved by critics, it\u2019s definitely a smart outsider bet. His suit vibe meanwhile is very much \u201cStop Making Sense David Byrne cosplay from Poundstretcher\u201d. Who do the bookies think is going to win? According to Oddschecker who collate various different odds, Nadine Shah is the favourite. She already won album of the year at the Aim awards earlier this month, and her record is certainly very 2018. A reflection on the refugee crisis, immigration, Trump, and the ennui of contemporary life, it very much fits with one of the stated aims of the prize: to \u201cprovide a snapshot of the year in music\u201d. Also, with its rugged, forthright backings, it\u2019s a little reminiscent of the most recent work by two-time winner PJ Harvey, and will likely have fans right across the judging panel. Also, points for that camo suit! So here is the full shortlist, with links to our reviews of the records in question: Lily Allen: No Shame Arctic Monkeys: Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino Everything Everything: A Fever Dream Everything Is Recorded: Everything Is Recorded Florence + the Machine: High as Hope Noel Gallagher\u2019s High Flying Birds: Who Built the Moon? King Krule: The Ooz Novelist: Novelist Guy Nadine Shah: Holiday Destination Jorja Smith: Lost and Found Sons of Kemet: Your Queen is a Reptile Wolf Alice: Visions of a Life Also at the ceremony is Iman Amrani, selfie-ing below, who will be posting action to the Guardian\u2019s Instagram stories. If you\u2019re following the ceremony here, on BBC4 and on Instagram you have some kind of screen addiction and should seek help, but please do so after enjoying our content this evening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
