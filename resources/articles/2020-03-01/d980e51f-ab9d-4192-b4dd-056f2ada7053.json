In a dramatic day of developments Marks &amp; Spencer axed its dividend to preserve cash because its clothing arm faced being \u201cseverely impacted\u201d over the coming months as Britons were forced to stop shopping. The retailer also said some stores could have to close temporarily. Arcadia, which owns Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, said it had taken the \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to close its more than 500 stores until further notice. The retailer said all staff would receive their normal pay for March \u201cafter which we will review this situation and will be keeping our store teams updated\u201d. In a sign of the scale of the slump that retailers now expect, Primark has written to suppliers urging them to \u201cseriously consider putting a halt on all current and future production and the purchasing of any materials in relation to any Primark orders\u201d. \u201cWe have been left with no option but to place a hold on any new orders being placed,\u201d the fashion retailer said. Orders already in train were also being reviewed, it said, adding: \u201cIt is likely that in most circumstances we will have little option but to terminate those orders pursuant to our contractual rights.\u201d Earlier this week Primark\u2019s parent company, Associated British Foods, said about a fifth of its selling space was already closed. Paul Marchant, the chief executive of Primark, said it could not have foreseen that over the course of a week, stores in every country in which it operated, with the exception of the UK, would have to close. Marchant said: \u201cWe have large quantities of existing stock in our stores, our depots and in transit that is paid for and if we do not take this action now we will be taking delivery of stock that we simply can\u2019t sell. This is unprecedented action for unprecedented and frankly unimaginable times.\u201d \u201cWe recognise and are deeply saddened that this will clearly have an effect throughout our entire supply chain,\u201d Marchant added. The gloomy update came as it emerged that the Debenhams chief executive, Stefaan Vansteenkiste, had written to the department store chain\u2019s suppliers to inform them they would be getting their money a month later than expected. \u201cUnfortunately, we have to ask you for extra support,\u201d wrote Vansteenkiste. \u201cWe will be extending all supplier payment terms by 30 days \u2013 except in those cases where we are already on extended terms. This decision is crucial to make sure we can ultimately pay the outstanding payable balances we have with you.\u201d Debenhams had already asked landlords for a five-month rent holiday as it faces \u201cunprecedented pressures\u201d because of the pandemic. The department store, which has closed 22 branches in recent months and is set to close 28 more next year, was struggling even before the virus hit. M&amp;S said it had served customers \u201cwithout cease through two world wars\u201d but the Covid-19 outbreak meant it anticipated the performance of its clothing and homewares departments \u2013 where sales were already falling \u2013 would worsen. It was seeing substantial declines in these departments and has redeployed many staff to support its food retail business amid a run on supermarkets by panicked shoppers. With demand for its spring and summer ranges expected to be weak, M&amp;S has ditched plans to order \u00a3100m worth of goods so as to avoid being left with a glut of stock. As Next\u2019s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, put it this week: \u201cPeople do not buy a new outfit to stay at home.\u201d Unlike high street rivals such as Next and Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group \u2013 which on Friday issued a profit warning and announced plans to close five Jack Wills stores \u2013 M&amp;S is expected to be among a handful of \u201cessential\u201d retailers alongside supermarkets and pharmacists permitted to keep shops open throughout the crisis. M&amp;S said its food halls were busier than usual but its bias towards selling chilled and fresh food (which have a short shelf life) meant it had not experienced the same huge sales uplifts experienced by the major grocers. M&amp;S said scrapping the dividend would save \u00a3130m as it warned profits for the year to the end of March could fall short of the \u00a3440m pencilled in by analysts. The government\u2019s decision to suspend business rates would also save it about \u00a3180m. In further evidence of the tough outlook faced by retailers, Hotel Chocolat said the virus signalled the closure of some or all of its 125 UK stores. Greg Lawless, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u201cThe UK retail sector is facing a storm of reduced footfall to the high street, particularly for the general retail sector. Nobody knows how long normal lives will have restrictions in place \u2013 so the impact on financial forecasts is unknown.\u201d \u201cCash preservation is the new priority,\u201d added Lawless. \u201cThose companies that adapt quickly and do the right thing will survive but we are in uncharted territory.\u201d In other developments: Harrods became the latest department store in London\u2019s West End to announce it was \u201cclosing for a while\u201d. Travis Perkins, the builders\u2019 merchant, cancelled its dividend and delayed the demerger of its Wickes chain to focus on crisis management ahead of an expected sharp downturn in sales if it was forced to shut its stores. Online estate agent Rightmove reported a dramatic fall in home buying and flat hunting. The estate agents Foxtons warned of a \u201cmaterial\u201d disruption to its business and said it has fully drawn down on a \u00a35m overdraft to boost its cash reserves. InterContinental Hotels Group, the owner of Holiday Inn and InterContinental chains, said demand for hotels was the lowest it had ever seen. Heathrow said it would stay open to safeguard \u201cvital supply lines\u201d but had to downsize. It has cancelled executive pay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
