It is expected to contain provisional dates for the Silverstone race as well as the French and San Marino grands prix. This will mean there are potentially 19 races being planned by Bernie Ecclestone, who holds the commercial rights to formula one, even though the teams are contracted for only 16 under the current Concorde agreement, which expires in 2007, and have to be paid a separately negotiable fee by Ecclestone for any further races. The teams are determined to take a firm line and make it clear that Ecclestone will have to share more of his commercial-rights income with them if they are to agree to 19 races. He is responding by positioning the three threatened traditional events in a way that may force the teams to back down if they, and their sponsors, want to keep racing at Silverstone, Imola and Magny-Cours. Tomorrow will not mark the last chance for Silverstone. The definitive calendar will not be published before the next FIA world council meeting in December and negotiations are expected to continue until then. Ray Bellm, the chairman of the British Racing Drivers' Club, which owns the Northamptonshire circuit, was yesterday expected to reply to Ecclestone, who sent two proposals to the club last week, neither of which it feels it can accept. One proposal called for a seven-year deal which, with a 10% annual escalator, would double the initial race fee from $13.5m (\u00a37.5m) to $27m (\u00a315m) over the period of the contract, leaving spectators to pay almost \u00a3400 as a basic admission fee in 2010. The other was for Ecclestone to promote the race for no fee in exchange for Silverstone effectively to be passed into his exclusive control for seven years. During last weekend's Japanese grand prix at Suzuka many team principals made it clear it was not acceptable to lose the British grand prix, for commercial and sporting reasons. \"It is my own personal feeling and personal wish that the race should happen next year,\" said David Richards, the BAR-Honda team principal. \"For us as a team and I am sure for many of the other British-based teams, the commercial impact of not having the event on all our staff is not acceptable. We need to find a solution.\" Paul Stoddart, the Minardi team principal, insisted: \"There will be a [British] race next year. Anyone who wants to put their money on that is on a pretty safe bet.\" Peter Sauber said: \"On the one hand I think 16 or 17 grands prix are enough, on the other hand Great Britain is the homeland of motorsport and I think it is important to have a British grand prix. Personally, I like the track at Silverstone.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
