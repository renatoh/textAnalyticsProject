As we start this unnecessary, voluntary, snail mail survey-thingie, the \u201cno\u201d case is loudly demanding the media run \u201cboth sides\u201d of the question. That makes it critical to precisely define the \u201cquestion\u201d itself. Because running both sides of the actual question is not the same as running \u201cboth sides\u201d of all the other spurious \u201cquestions\u201d the anti-equality case is setting up as obfuscations. So here, at the get-go, is a list of the arguments this is not about, and to which Guardian Australia will definitely not be giving \u201cequal time\u201d or attention. This is not about \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, that wonderfully nebulous term subverted by the right to become a catch-all cri de coeur against elites refusing to listen to the common sense views of ordinary people. Former prime minister Tony Abbott and the Australian Christian Lobby were both employing this handy it\u2019s-really-about-something-else-entirely tactic from day one. \u201cVoting no will help to stop political correctness in its tracks,\u201d Abbott claimed, champing to lead the march into another war on something or other. But quite obviously \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d does not apply \u2013 even if we were clear about what it meant \u2013 because we already know (from actual, properly weighted, surveys) that the overwhelming majority of Australians want marriage equality and that it is the elites, in this case some churches and a determined group of politicians like Abbott, who are resisting. It is also not about a \u201cstolen generation\u201d of children, or any other claim that children of same-sex couples are disadvantaged. The argument is offensive, particularly to gay parents, as articulated in the Senate this week by Penny Wong, incredulous at the suggestion the survey could become a \u201cunifying moment\u201d while people were saying such things. \u201cThe Australian Christian Lobby described our children as \u2018the stolen generation\u2019. We love our children, and I object \u2013 as does every person who cares about children and as do all those same-sex couples in this country who have kids \u2013 to being told that our children are a \u2018stolen generation\u2019. You talk about unifying moments? That\u2019s not a unifying moment. It\u2019s exposing our children to that kind of hatred,\u201d she said, with the quiet fury of a woman who should not have to defend her parenting but finds herself having to anyway. But as well as being offensive, the argument is also obviously illogical. Children are already being born into same-sex families, and preventing their parents from being married will do nothing to stop this. In fact allowing couples who have already decided to nurture and love children to marry would provide them with additional security and public recognition and support. This is, in fact, quite a conservative notion, as explained by Tony Abbott\u2019s former speechwriter Paul Ritchie in a book setting out the conservative case for same-sex marriage. \u201cAllowing same-sex couples to marry is not just a matter of law. It\u2019s also a matter of heart and soul. It reflects a universal hope: to be blessed by family and friends, and to share your life, with its trials and tribulations, laughter and joy, with the one that you love. \u201cThe institution of marriage affirms us as people; gives standing to our most significant relationship; and changes our families for the better. It is an institution that points to a better life and helps us answer the deepest question: can I selflessly love another and find meaning and purpose in that love? This is a conservative ideal,\u201d he writes. Nor is this about anti-bullying or \u201csafe school\u201d campaigns, or about any kind of creeping \u201crainbow ideology\u201d or \u201cgay agenda\u201d allegedly infiltrating the education system. That is an entirely separate scare campaign/discussion, as applicable or otherwise to the children of same-sex or opposite-sex parents. It has no relevance to marriage equality. And it is not about whether the Labor party is hypocritical for not changing the law during its time in government. It\u2019s true that they didn\u2019t, but this is a decision for this parliament, at this time. And Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who has also changed his mind on the subject, has made his party\u2019s position completely transparent. This discussion is, to some extent, about where to draw the line between religious freedoms and freedom from discrimination, and this will be central to the \u201cno\u201d campaign. But draft legislation and private members\u2019 bills have already provided exemptions for religious institutions and, in some cases, civil celebrants. Some argue the exemptions should extend to individuals or non religious institutions, for example to the much-spoken of, but seldom actually seen, \u201cconscientious objectors\u201d to same sex marriage among the ranks of wedding providers like florists, cake decorators or erectors of large marquees. The private members\u2019 bill introduced by Liberal Dean Smith covered service providers linked in some way to religious institutions. I can\u2019t see any justification for further stretching the anti-discrimination provisions from religiously-affiliated institutions to everyday service providers or businesses and institutions which wish to operate as though the marriage law had not changed. Service providers haven\u2019t been exempted from anti-discrimination laws in the past when other laws have changed due to social pressure and changing attitudes. There may still be some publicans around who genuinely think women shouldn\u2019t drink in public bars, as was illegal in some states until the 1960s. But it is, thank goodness, now illegal for them to refuse us service. The anti-same-sex marriage lobby also argues marriage equality threatens religious \u201cfreedoms\u201d in schools, which should be able to continue to teach that marriage should only occur between a man and a woman even if the law is changed \u2013 a curious position for organisations that would almost certainly be outraged if some other religion demanded the right to teach something contrary to the applicable law of Australia. And these decisions about where to draw the line between religious freedom and discrimination are details, not determinants of the central question that this government is tying itself \u2013 and now also the country \u2013 in knots trying to answer. This is, very simply, about tying just one sort of knot, answering that one straightforward question. If there was a reasonable argument to say \u201cno\u201d, we\u2019d certainly discuss it.
