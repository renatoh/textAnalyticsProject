Reports emerged on Thursday that Alek Sigley, a 29-year-old living and studying in Pyongyang, had been arrested in North Korea. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed it was providing consular support to the man\u2019s family, and was \u201curgently seeking clarification\u201d about Sigley\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular assistance, in accordance with the consular services charter, to the family of an Australian man who has been reported as being detained in North Korea,\u201d a Dfat spokesman said. In a statement released on Thursday, a spokesman for the Sigley family said they had not been able to confirm that he had been detained, but that he had been out of contact for the past 48 hours. \u201cAs of 1pm AEST it has not been confirmed that Alek has been detained in the DPRK,\u201d the family statement read. \u201cThe situation is that Alek has not been in digital contact with friends and family since Tuesday morning Australian time, which is unusual for him. \u201cAlek is an Australian-born Asian scholar and traveller who has visited, studied and lived in several countries in Asia. Alek can speak Mandarin and Korean fluently, as well as some Japanese. \u201cAlek\u2019s family hope to re-establish contact with him soon.\u201d Sigley had been studying a master\u2019s degree in Korean literature at Kim Il Sung University and runs a tour company that organises trips for foreign students. He first traveled to the DPRK in 2014. Leonid Petrov, an North Korea expert from the Australian National University who is friends with Sigley, said he last spoke to the Australian, briefly, three days ago but has not heard from him since then. \u201cHis Skype is active, I can see the green light, but he doesn\u2019t respond to my messages,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Originally from Perth, Sigley is a former student at the Australian National University\u2019s college of Asia and the Pacific, where he focused on North Korean propaganda. He graduated last July. He married in North Korea last year, though it\u2019s understood his wife does not live in Pyongyang with him. In 2016 he received a New Colombo scholarship to study at Sogang University in South Korea. Details of the scholarship state that he planned to undertake an internship with Korean Herald newspaper. Petrov said that from Sogang, Sigley was eventually able to become the first Australian to study in Pyongyang. \u201cHe went to Pyongyang to do his masters. He had just now submitted his thesis and was probably ready to go on a holiday,\u201d he said. Describing Sigley as \u201cintelligent\u201d, \u201csoft in his manner\u201d and \u201cvery sympathetic towards the Korean people both north and south\u201d, Petrov said he was unsure what had happened to his friend. \u201cI don\u2019t know frankly, is he in detention in North Korea? Or China? Or maybe he\u2019s in hospital?,\u201d he said. In March, Sigley wrote for Guardian Australia about his experience living in there, saying that as a long-term foreign resident on a student visa he had \u201cnearly unprecedented access to Pyongyang\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m free to wander around the city, without anyone accompanying me,\u201d he said. \u201cInteraction with locals can be limited at times, but I can shop and dine almost anywhere I want.\u201d His disappearance comes as Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, is in Osaka ahead of a meeting with the US president, Donald Trump, on the eve of a G20 summit. At the weekend, Trump will visit Seoul to hold talks with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, before a possible third US-North Korean summit. The US has raised the proposition of further talks with North Korea after previous negotiations stalled. On Thursday the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the Australian embassy in South Korea was working with Swedish officials in Pyongyang. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously some complications in providing consular assistance into North Korea \u2013 we work through the Swedish government [and] all of those steps are under way,\u201d he said. He said he had not spoken to Morrison about whether the prime minister would raise Sigley\u2019s detention with Trump. He also operates an Australia-based tour operator, Tongil Tours, specialising in educational tourism to North Korea. The company\u2019s website is advertising a summer language program in North Korea due to begin on Saturday. Sigley\u2019s latest blogpost on the company\u2019s website, on 20 June, talked about visiting restaurants in Pyongyang with other foreign students. This week he tweeted about a new hotel opening in the capital. Euan Graham, the executive director of La Trobe Asia and an expert on North Korea, said while the country\u2019s motivations were hard to predict \u201cthey\u2019re obviously not doing this in a bubble\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if there is any judicial process that happens independently of politics in North Korea,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to make this move they will already have assessed the fact it will be read as a potential political case, and the timing in terms of an anticipated potential third summit between Trump and Kim Jong-un. \u201cThe North Koreans will obviously factor the politics into account before they act. Ahead of any negotiations both sides are seeking leverage so that\u2019s one potential explanation, but it is only one.\u201d Other foreigners detained by North Korea include the US college student Otto Warmbier, who was imprisoned in 2016. Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years of hard labour after North Korea found him guilty of \u201ccrimes against the state\u201d for allegedly taking a propaganda poster on a visit with a tour group. But on the face of it, Graham said, Sigley\u2019s case appeared vastly different. \u201cAlek Sigley has been in Pyongyang for over a year, he\u2019s enrolled in the most prestigious university in North Korea and has been steadily tweeting out a diet of carefully calibrated messages which aren\u2019t really too sensitive and actually quite favourable for the outside impression of North Korea in terms of pop culture, food and the like,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that sense it\u2019s more surprising. If he\u2019s been suddenly taken into detention it\u2019s something that only hurts the North Korean image because Sigley has, I think, been trying to paint North Korea in a fairly positive or benign light.\u201d A Beijing-based business analyst who runs similar tours through North Korea and knows Sigley, said while the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of foreign trips to North Korea were \u201ctrouble free\u201d, the Australian\u2019s situation was different. \u201cAlek wasn\u2019t there on tour for a few days, he was actually living there,\u201d the analyst, who asked to remain anonymous said. \u201cNot only living there but tweeting and writing columns and, while he was not hostile to North Korea or politicising, it\u2019s a relevant fact that North Korea takes a very specific and direct dislike to people it deems to be journalists and correspondents. \u201cSigley wasn\u2019t a journalist but it could have been inferred from his social media account, even if what he was saying was not at all hostile. This is all speculation, of course \u2013 we don\u2019t know for sure what has happened here.\u201d Australia does not have formal diplomatic ties with North Korea and consular assistance is provided by the Swedish embassy on a limited basis. Australia has previously communicated with North Korea through Pyongyang\u2019s embassy in Jakarta. It\u2019s understood that Colin Crooks, the British ambassador to North Korea, is providing assistance in Sigley\u2019s case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
