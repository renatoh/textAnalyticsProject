But this wasn\u2019t any old failed eurogroup meeting. This might be remembered as a classic. We had Germany producing a half-baked scheme to boot Greece out for five years, Finland\u2019s new government on the edge of meltdown, and Italy preparing to raise the stakes on Sunday by telling Germany that enough is enough. Meanwhile, Greece\u2019s economy is in freefall, its banks are on the edge, and its political class are reeling after Alexis Tsipras offered billions of euros in fresh austerity to get a deal. From Brussels, our Europe editor Ian Traynor sums up the situation after another frustrating, and sometimes bizarre, day: Greece\u2019s final attempt to avoid being kicked out of the euro by securing a new three-year bailout worth up to \u20ac80bn ran into a wall of resistance from the eurozone\u2019s fiscal hawks on Saturday. Finland rejected any more funding for the country and Germany called for Greece to be turfed out of the currency bloc for at least five years. The last chance talks between the 19 eurozone finance ministers in Brussels ran into the early hours of the morning as they struggled to draft a policy paper for national leaders at yet another emergency summit on Sunday that was billed as the decisive meeting. With Greece on the edge of financial and social implosion, eurozone finance ministers met to decide on the country\u2019s fate and on what to do about its debt crisis, after experts from the troika of creditors said that new fiscal rigour proposals from Athens were good enough to form \u201cthe basis for negotiations\u201d. But the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, dismissed that view, supported by a number of northern and eastern European states. A German finance ministry paper said: \u201cThese proposals cannot build the basis for a completely new, three-year [bailout] programme, as requested by Greece.\u201d It called for Greece to be expelled from the eurozone for a minimum of five years and demanded that the Greek government transfer \u20ac50bn of state assets to an outside agency for sell-off. Timo Soini, the nationalist True Finns leader, meanwhile, threatened to bring down the government in Helsinki if Alex Stubb, the finance minister, agreed to a new bailout for Greece. Stubb apparently came to the crunch meeting on a new bailout without a mandate to agree one..... Here\u2019s Ian\u2019s full story: Tomorrow\u2019s leaders\u2019 summit could be explosive, given we\u2019re expecting Matteo Renzi to urge Angela Merkel to show some leadership and end the crisis. And with eurogroup president Dijsselbloem warning that the situation is \u201cvery difficult\u201d, there\u2019s no guarantee of a breakthrough when ministers resume talks. But a good night\u2019s sleep might help. So in that spirit, I\u2019m going to end this liveblog until the morning. (unless anything sensational happens). Thanks, as ever, for reading and helping. Goodnight! GW The message from Greece tonight - don\u2019t blame us, we\u2019re doing our best: European solidarity, eh? If eurozone finance ministers cannot reach a deal on Sunday morning, they will pass the hot potato onto the 28 leaders of EU countries in the afternoon: The FT\u2019s Duncan Robinson confirms that the eurogroup is far from a deal. Spain\u2019s Luis de Guindos spoke to the media before hotfooting it into the darkness. I missed Christine Lagarde\u2019s departure, but a replay shows that the IMF chief only gave a wave to the cameras. Here comes Euclid Tsakalotos.....and there goes Euclid Tsakalotos! Greece\u2019s finance minister exited the building at a marching pace, mobile phone glued to his ear, deep in conversation. Not a word for the press, alas. Here\u2019s a video clip of Pierre Moscovici\u2019s comments tonight: Some ministers are walking past the media and refusing to speak, including Ireland\u2019s Michael Noonan. I guess they\u2019ve got nothing encouraging to say. Mario Draghi just got into a car without comment. Here comes Pierre Moscovici....and actually he (for once) doesn\u2019t look too upbeat. He tells reporters (in French) that there is always hope. Michel Sapin\u2019s optimism is unquenchable! Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb told reporters that tonight\u2019s meeting made \u2018good progress\u2019 This is the same Alex Stubb who apparently can\u2019t back a third bailout? Jerosn Dijsselbloem, head of the eurogroup, is speaking now at the exit. He confirms that the meeting is adjourned until 11am tomorrow morning. We have had an in-depth discussion of the Greek proposals. The issue of credibility and trust was discussed, and also of course the financial issues involved. It is still very difficult, but work is still in progress. It does NOT look good, I\u2019m afraid. Eurozone ministers are being collared as they leave the meeting - here\u2019s a live feed. Ian adds that there won\u2019t be a press conference tonight. No statement either. We\u2019re basically in limbo until the morning. Ian confirms that the eurogroup is breaking up, to resume in the morning Eurogroup ministers are going to resume talks in 11 hours time: The prime minister of Malta has tweeted that the eurogroup meeting failed to reach an agreement (as had become clear in recent hours) Muscat, like other EU leaders, will be attending Sunday\u2019s emergency summit on Greece. But is that to discuss Grexit, or to hammer out political agreement on a third bailout? The Eurogroup meeting is over! Until the morning...... The Finns really have put a spanner in the works, by the sound of it: So the source isn\u2019t Euclid, anyway. Hopes of an early finish are being trampled into the carpet. The Brussels press pack are heading that the eurogroup may run for another three hours. Here\u2019s something to chew on. A eurozone bailout, as Jennifer flagged up earlier, only needs 85% support if the situation is an emergency. But some country\u2019s have rather more muscle than others, reflecting their financial contribution to bailout funds. Many of the smaller countries only have a tiny share of the vote. Finland and Slokavia may have hard-talking finance ministers, but when the chips are actually down, it\u2019s France, Italy, and of course Germany who actually have veto power, while Spain just needs a few allies. The Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and Austria also have enough power to influence a really tight vote. So much for finishing at 10pm Brussels time..... Tomorrow, Italy is reportedly going to demand that Germany hammers out an agreement with Greece, our datablog editor, Alberto Nardelli, hears tonight. Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi has had enough, Alberto understands. It\u2019s time to stop humiliating Greece, and end this crisis. Tomorrow, at the summit of eurozone leaders, Renzi will insist that chancellor Angela Merkel finds an agreement, for the good of the European Union. This crisis just gets more, and more, and more serious. And compelling. Back in Greece, economy minister George Stathakis has warned that the country could face some capital controls all though the summer. Reuters has the details: Stathakis told Greece\u2019s Mega TV that the banks could reopen as soon as next week, if an agreement with creditors is reached this weekend, but other restrictions on withdrawals and currency exports would remain in place for most. \u201cThat will stay in play for two months or some months,\u201d he said. This appears to be the German finance ministry\u2019s paper, which suggests Greece could be offered a \u2018temporary\u2019 exit from the eurozone. As you can see, it argues that this would allow Greece to restructure its debts, and also get humanitarian support. Finnish TV is reporting that the Helsinki government will not support a new Greek aid package. So, it\u2019s over? Not necessarily. There\u2019s an emergency procedure which allows financial assistance to be granted from the ESM with just 85% support, in a real emergency: That may not help get an agreement through the eurogroup tonight, though..... Sounds like a statement is being drawn up tonight....but it\u2019s not a decisive Yes or No to a Greek deal. It sounds more like an Ummmmm....: The Eurogroup meeting is buzzing with talk that the Finnish government might collapse, if it backs a third Greek bailout. My colleagues Ian and Jennifer have the latest: (that\u2019s Timo Soini, leader of the True Finns) Eurozone ministers have been discussing Greece\u2019s bailout request for hours, with no signs of an major breakthrough. The meeting may end soon, though, after around six hours which began with smiles, and frowns. EU sources say that creditors are demanding tougher measures, on top of the \u20ac13bn plan of tax rises, pension reforms and spending cuts already offered. Several countries have already questioned whether Greece has done enough, and warned that trust in the Greek government has been badly hit by the last few weeks\u2019 events. Germany has reportedly drawn up a paper suggesting Greece could temporarily exit the eurozone, to general disbelief: And Finland\u2019s government is rumoured to be taking a very hard line, with reports suggesting its coalition could break up over Greece. It could all be bargaining tactics, though, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s leaders summits Economists have warned that Greece needs a deal urgently, so that its banking sector can be replenished with desperately needed liquidity. And in Athens, a senior government minister has suggested that Syriza MPs who can\u2019t support the austerity plan should quit. Life has been carrying on in Athens tonight, as the eurogroup meeting rolls on: The Greek crisis is putting serious strain on Finland\u2019s new government. Maria Stenroos, EU correspondent for state broadcaster Yle, reports that the Finnish delegation is taking an even tougher line than Germany. (The right-wing, euro-sceptic True Finns are coalition partners in the new government, which was formed in May) This is getting a lot of play on Finnish TV tonight. But would Helsinki really outflank Berlin on this? Jarno Hartikainen of business newspaper Kauppalehti reckons not: The BBC\u2019s Chris Morris has more details on the measures that Greece is being pushed for tonight (as Ian reported earlier) A week of nail-biting votes in Athens, as well as crunch meetings in Brussels? Oh great. Could ministers come back in the morning for another crack at the problem? Apparently, tonight\u2019s dinner isn\u2019t going too well: Given the sheer number of eurogroup meetings in recent weeks, ministers must have exhausted their reserves of small talk. \u201cBeen anywhere nice recently?\u201d \u201cBrussels, Brussels, Brussels, Brussels, oh yes Luxembourg..... and Brussels.\u201d Rumour watch: the eurogroup meeting might finish in just over an hour\u2019s time: (there\u2019s a scheduled Eurogroup meeting on Monday, but a second meeting would be unscheduled) So much for kicking out the Troika.... Greece\u2019s creditors are drafting a response to Athen\u2019s bailout proposal - outlining what extra measures are needed, reports our Europe editor: Ian also hears that eurozone ministers may fail to reach an agreement tonight - kicking the can upstairs to the euro leaders meeting tomorrow. Channel 4\u2019s Paul Mason has a handy summary of the state of play this evening: Now here\u2019s a tasty rumour: We\u2019ve been told that French officials provided \u201cinvaluable\u201d help in drawing up the current Greek proposals. Can\u2019t imagine why Berlin would be cross..... More head-shaking in Brussels: Wolfango Piccoli, analyst at Teneo Intelligence, reckons that Alexis Tsipras has four options following the mini-rebellion at last night\u2019s vote over his reform plan: He could resign and trigger snap polls after reaching a deal with his lenders. This would leave Greece in limbo for around 3-4 weeks, a development that would raise significant concerns among the lenders and complicate meeting the relevant targets (milestones) attached to the likely sub-tranches of a new bailout. He could decide to tackle decisively the situation by breaking with the dissenters and replacing those MPs who voted \u201cNo\u201d or abstained, including the two ministers and the parliament speaker. This could be achieved by enforcing SYRIZA\u2019s internal rule forcing (on paper) MPs to give up their seats after leaving the parliamentary group. He could seek to enlarge the governing coalition by including one or more of the opposition parties, notably POTAMI and Pasok. The creation of a wider coalition would reassure the lenders but it is, in our view, the least likely of the available options. Finally, he could decide to move cautiously (as he has done in the past) by replacing only the two MPs who voted \u201cNo\u201d, meaning that an unstable balance would prevail in the short-term, at least. But whatever Tsipras chooses, there\u2019s a high chance of another general election this year, Wolf adds. Over in Athens, economy minister Giorgos Stathakis has said he\u2019s confident the government will be able to get parliamentary approval for its reform plans. And he also warned that any Syriza MP who disagrees should resign their seat. Stathakis told Mega TV that: \u201cIf a lawmaker of a leftist party disagrees with the policies of the government...they should follow the rules and if they strongly disagree resign their seat. Stathakis added that \u201cif it were me, I would resign\u201d. (that\u2019s via Reuters) Last night, 17 Syriza MPs either opposed the plan, abstained or were absent during the vote. That included energy minister, and influential Syriza member, Panagiotis Lafazanis. Greece\u2019s former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, may feel vindicated by the news of a German government paper proposing a temporary Grexit. He\u2019s written an opinion piece in today\u2019s Guardian, claiming Sch\u00e4uble wanted to drive Greece out to \u201cput the fear of God\u201d into the French. And he\u2019s just tweeted: Eurozone finance ministers are pausing to refuel after three hours of talks, Cyprus government spokesman Nikos Christodoulides flags up. Talks could go well into the night, we hear.... Although there is growing optimism in Athens, there is also fear for the future after weeks of unsettling drama, as Helena Smith reports: I just chatted with Vicky Pryce, the prominent economist. She says she has been taken aback not only by the yearning for normality she has encountered since arriving in Athens but the sheer level of anxiety she has also seen. \u201cEveryone wants the banks to reopen so that some normality can return and businesses can re-open,\u201d she told me. \u201cPeople are really very, very, fearful, a lot have been telling me they have been having panic attacks because of the anxiety that this situation has produced. No one wants to even go to the beach [in the southern suburbs]. When I asked why, I was told they are all at home guarding their money!\u201d There were mass withdrawals of savings by Greeks fearing the collapse of the banking system, before capital controls were imposed nearly two weeks ago. Pryce, who has openly opposed the tough austerity measures being asked of Athens, said it was now crucial that an agreement was reached with the country\u2019s creditors. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very painful but we are where we are and right now so very much hangs on signing it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Greece gets this bailout it will not only bring liquidity into the system but open the possibility of the country entering the quantitative easing scheme [set up] by the European Central Bank which would then allow rates to come down in the capital markets. That would be terribly, terribly important in helping to turn things around.\u201d Maybe Wolfgang\u2019s just waiting for the right moment to drop it into the conversation.... More leaks, as ministers take a break after three hour of talks. Reuters says that Euro zone finance ministers told Euclid Tsakalotos that Athens must offer deeper reforms to persuade them to open talks on a third bailout. Two sources said there was consensus among the other 18 ministers around the table that the leftist government in Athens must take further steps to convince them it would honour any new debts. That fits with the noises coming out of Germany, that Athens can\u2019t simply propose measures \u2018left undone\u2019 from its second bailout to qualify for a third aid package. The Telegraph\u2019s Mehreen Khan points out another reason that temporary Grexit is somewhat bonkers: Ie, it reduces the eurozone to a mere fixed exchange rate system, not an expression (however flawed) of European solidarity. Sky News\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway, agrees that \u2018temporary\u2019 Grexit is a non-starter: But it might reassure German voters and MPs: Greek officials have denied that Germany has suggested they clear off for five years, reports Euronews\u2019s Efi Koutsokosta. Germany\u2019s Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper is reporting that the German finance ministry has proposed two options for Greece - including a temporary \u2018timeout\u2019 from the eurozone! Under the first course, Greece would improve its existing proposals, and also transfer some \u20ac50bn of property assets to sell off to pay debts (not clear which assets they have in mind. Islands? The Parthenon perhaps?) The second option would see Greece leaves the monetary union for at least five years and restructures its debt. It would remain as the EU Member and receives further \u201cgrowth-enhancing, humanitarian and technical assistance\u201d. Here\u2019s the story: Sch\u00e4uble bringt \u201eGrexit\u201c auf Zeit ins Gespr\u00e4ch The finance ministry are declining to comment: I suppose they could be serious (assuming FAS are right). But it\u2019s riddled with problems. For starters, if Greece shifts to a depreciated Drachma it\u2019ll find it even harder to service its existing euro debts. What happens to the banking sector once the emergency liquidity is removed, and the euro deposits locked inside. And once you\u2019re left the eurozone, even \u2018temporarily\u2019, can you really be certain you\u2019ll be allowed back in? Over in Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports that despite the obstacles Greece and its creditors have to overcome, there is optimism that a deal can be reached. And it is beginning to show. The age-old adage that psychology is everything in economics was evident for all to see on the streets of Athens today. A deal may be as far away as ever, but prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 abrupt decision to embrace reforms he once vehemently opposed has raised optimism. Taverna owners, shop keepers and families enjoying the summer sun in Athens\u2019 old town of Plaka, this afternoon, spoke of relief that the drama of recent weeks might, finally, be coming to an end. \u201cEveryone is praying for this uncertainty to end,\u201d said Georgia Poulidou who owns a local gift shop. \u201cEveryone just looks a lot happier and I am not talking about tourists. Let\u2019s hope Germany doesn\u2019t make it too difficult.\u201d The improved psychology was also reflected in business with firms reporting an increase in turnover on hopes of a financial lifeline being thrown to Greece. \u201cSince yesterday Greeks have started eating again,\u201d said Michalis Alexiou an employee in a catering firm in the northern suburb of Maroussi. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, people are suddenly no longer afraid to spend. Everyone is hoping for a solution,\u201d he told me. Analysts said despite the political tumult Tsipras was bound to face, almost six months after assuming power, he had \u201ccrossed the rubicon\u201d by agreeing to take on the cost of reforms and hardliners in the ranks of his own Syriza party. \u201cHe is going to confront a lot of problems with former comrades, some of the more extremist elements in Syriza\u2019s ranks,\u201d said Aristides Hatzis, professor of economics and law at Athens University. \u201cI see a reshuffle very soon and many of those who refused to endorse the proposed reforms in the parliament will probably resign.\u201d Across the room, Italy\u2019s Pier Carlo Padoan (left) and France\u2019s Michel Sapin (right) discussed matters with commissioner Pierre Moscovici.... While Slovakia\u2019s Peter Kazimir caught up with Portugal\u2019s Maria Luis Albuquerque: And Christine Lagarde gave Euclid Tsakalotos quite a look:.... This is Euclid Tsakalotos\u2019s second eurogroup meeting as Greece\u2019s finance minister, and he got a friendly welcome from, among others, France\u2019s Michel Sapin: He\u2019s next to Spain\u2019s Luis de Guindos (taking his seat here), who hopes to be elected as the eurogroup\u2019s new president on Monday. The current incumbent, Jeroen Dijsselbloem has been giving the thumbs-up:.... But also looking rather gloomy as he spoke with Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb (centre) IMF chief Christine Lagarde is in the room too: And has been comparing notes with Klaus Regling, who runs the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) While Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble looked like a man expecting \u201cextraordinarily difficult negotiations\u201d today: My colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels has rounded up events so far today: Here\u2019s the video of Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s caustic remarks on Greece as he arrived at the Eurogroup meeting (in German): Away from Brussels and back to some of the people most affected by the current crisis. From Thessaloniki: Vassilis, 48, is exactly the kind of Greek who will be most affected by whatever is or isn\u2019t agreed in Brussels tonight. Today he sells Thessaloniki\u2019s version of the Big Issue on one of the city\u2019s main streets \u2013 the result of losing his job as a truck driver three years ago, and ending up homeless. The deal as it currently stands would bring Vassilis more pain: a huge rise in VAT on food. But perhaps surprisingly, he is in favour of it passing. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote in the referendum,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with difficulty and with pain, I would have voted yes.\u201d A hike in food prices will hurt Vassilis as much as it\u2019ll hurt everyone. But that\u2019s why it\u2019s needed, he claims: the government doesn\u2019t have too many alternative means of levying tax. \u201cOnly the restaurants and cafes are making money,\u201d reckons Vassilis. \u201cWith 50 euros, people will buy food not clothes, and so [the government] doesn\u2019t have any other way of making money.\u201d Apart from slashing public sector salaries, he adds. \u201cBut they won\u2019t do that.\u201d Resignation to more austerity extends even to \u2018no\u2019 voters, people who only a week ago rejected more cuts and debts. \u201cFor the people who don\u2019t have money, the VAT will be an issue,\u201d says Giorgios Voutas, a 56-year-old no-voter who sells rice, nuts and spices in a market in central Thessaloniki. \u201cBut what I\u2019m guessing is that the increase will be absorbed by us sellers \u2013 and we\u2019ll try to make the money back by finding new wholesalers, or reducing the packaging.\u201d As a no-voter, does he feel betrayed by Alexis Tsipras? The prime minister has agreed to more austerity, despite a mandate for the opposite from the electorate. \u201cNo way,\u201d says Voutas, arguing Tsipras tried his best against an intransigent Europe. \u201cThe Europeans aren\u2019t capable of surprising us with something good.\u201d But austerity doesn\u2019t really make any sense, Voutas adds. \u201cWould these European countries like their money back?\u201d he asks. \u201cIn order to find the money to pay them we need investment and economic development \u2013 but when will we see all this?\u201d Here is the Associated Press take on the German finance minister\u2019s tough comments as he arrived for the Eurogroup meeting: Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, warned that that Saturday\u2019s meeting of the eurozone\u2019s 19 finance ministers over Greece\u2019s bailout request was going to be tough. Schaeuble, who has taken a hard line on Greece over recent months, says the Greek government will have to do a lot more than just say it wants to reform if it\u2019s going to get the three-year bailout it requested for earlier this week. \u201cWe will definitely not be able to rely on promises,\u201d he said when arriving at the talks in Brussels. Schaeuble put the blame for the current crisis firmly on the shoulders of the radical left Syriza government that was elected in January. The \u201chopeful\u201d situation regarding Greece at the end of last year has been \u201cdestroyed by the last months,\u201d he said. Schaeuble said Saturday\u2019s discussions would be \u201cextraordinarily difficult.\u201d So the tone from finance ministers going into the meeting was that the Greeks have made some progress with their latest proposals, but can they be trusted to implement what they have promised? Given that the Greek government called its referendum and advised voting against the proposals which were then on the table, only to put forward broadly similar plans a few days later, you can understand the scepticism. It almost seemed that if Alexis Tsipras received a euro for every time the word \u201ctrust\u201d was mentioned, Greece\u2019s financial problems would be over immediately. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble of course put it most bluntly, saying trust had been destroyed \u201cin an incredible manner.\u201d But there were plenty of officials trying to keep an open mind, clearly aware that pushing Greece over the brink would be an irreversible step. There were even suggestions that the thorny issue of debt relief was up for discussion, even if reaching an agreement would seem rather unlikely. Still, with the institutions (the EU, ECB and IMF) sounding cautiously positive about the Greek proposals, albeit with some reservations, there is at least the basis for discussion. And they\u2019re off. (Just when we thought Finland\u2019s finance minister was being uncommunicative) Spain\u2019s Luis de Guindos said he hoped Greece would not leave the eurozone: And here is German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble: In a broadside at the Greeks he said we cannot only rely on promises. Trust has been destroyed over the past months in an incredible manner. Pierre Gramegna, finance minister of Luxembourg which currently holds the EU presidency, said he was \u201cin a lighter heart than two days ago.\u201d We have proposals on the table, which are comprehensive. What can Greece do about the lack of trust? It is important to find out about the concrete steps [which will be taken] and how they are prepared to translate that into legislative initiatives which can be voted for in parliament. Draft bills, the prospect of a vote will build confidence. On debt: We are prepared to discuss debt restructuring today, whether we all agree is another matter. He said the Greek proposals were enough for a second bailout programme but not a third. Slovakia\u2019s Peter Kazimir sees debt sustainability as \u201ca huge problem\u2019. It\u2019s going to be a difficult meeting, says Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem. We are not there yet, there is still some criticisms of the proposals, on the fiscal front and the reforms. But there is the issue of trust. Can the Greek government be trusted to do what they are proposing. How can they prove trust? They\u2019ll have to listen to the institutions and show their commitment to implementing [the proposals] And speaking of France. French finance minister Michel Sapin said there were two positive signs, that the Greek government had shown courage and determination in presenting its proposals to parliament, and secondly that the institutions see them as a good basis for discussions. He added that the topic of debt was not taboo: \u201cWe have the right to talk about debt.\u201d Meanwhile the conciliatory tone by France, which helped with the Greek proposals, continues. Reuters reports: A bailout package for Greece needs to include a reduction in the country\u2019s debt burden, French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron told German daily Die Welt in an interview published on Saturday. The German government has resisted a restructuring of Greece\u2019s debts... but Macron insisted the burden must be eased. \u201cIt is necessary to reduce the debt burden so that the Greek economy does not go under,\u201d he told Die Welt. Outlining the path to solving the Greek problem, Macron said structural reforms needed to be deepened, adding: \u201cMore competition doesn\u2019t mean saving more!\u201d Investment was also essential to supporting growth in Greece, said. \u201cNot to try everything possible to keep Greece in the euro zone would be to accept a step backwards in Europe,\u201d Macron said. Italian finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan said: The purpose of the meeting is to kick off negotiations on [an] ESM [bailout]. We are all here with open minds. It is the beginning of negotiations, not about striking a deal tonight. Malta\u2019s finance minister Edward Scicluna said the Greek issue has to be solved today, but he summed up the mood: There are some who are very sceptical, some less so. This doesn\u2019t sound particularly helpful: It\u2019s hard to call how things will go at the Eurogroup meeting, with much talk from the arriving officials of progress being made, but also many calls for the Greek government to actually implement whatever may be agreed. Alexander Stubb, the Finnish finance minister who has taken to tweeting developments, has not been so forthcoming today: More from Noonan\u2019s comments, courtesy of Open Europe: Irish finance minister Michael Noonan said Greece must get on with implementing agreed proposals: It is hard to deliver if your parliamentary majority diminishes. While they have a majority I believe they should move to carry out the legislative changes. [Presumably a reference to those Greek MPs who did not support the proposals in the earlier vote] EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis sounds more positive: We are clearly making progress. The Greek government proposal is pretty much along the lines of what the institutions proposal was before the referendum. There is a willingness on the Greek side to reach an agreement. [But] there are still many issues and many concerns of the member states to be addressed. Today we are discussing giving a mandate to [the EU, ECB and IMF] to start negotiations about an ESM programme. Dutch finance minister Eric Wiebes is taking a fairly tough line: The Greeks have clearly made a step forward. At the same time the institutions have been critical.. the plan is weaker in some areas than it should be. Their suggestion is we can only start negotiations when these conditions are filled in. Many governments including my own [are worried about] implementation. We are discussing a proposal that was rejected [in the referendum]. Clearly there has to be a step made towards restoring trust. What if there is no agreement tonight? That is up to the Greek government. More from Schelling: And again, the emphasis on implementation, this time from Austria\u2019s Schelling (almost as if the finance ministers do not trust the Greeks to do what they say.) (and in the foreground Austrian finance minister Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling). Here\u2019s a video of EU economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici arriving for the Eurogroup meeting (in French): EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the Greek government had made a significant gesture but it needed to implement reforms: IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said, \u201cWe are here to make a lot more progress.\u201d And the finance ministers are starting to arrive. Here is Greece\u2019s Euclid Tsakalotos, keeping his own counsel: If you haven\u2019t yet seen the piece on Alexis Tsipras and Syriza from our economics editor Larry Elliott, it\u2019s well worth a read (spoiler: he says untold damage has been caused to the Greek economy for no purpose whatsoever): The lack of support from some members of his partly for Alexis Tsipras\u2019 proposals in last night\u2019s vote could have repercussions, according to Niki Kitsantonis of Greek newspaper Kathimerini: And the chances of a deal seem to be getting worse by the minute: In Thessaloniki, many Greeks appear resigned to further austerity even though theyi voted against that very thing in last Sunday\u2019s referendum. Patrick Kingsley reports: Clara Sklavounou, a toy-shop owner in central Thessaloniki, might have reason to feel let down. Sklavounou voted no in last week\u2019s referendum \u2013 \u201cno to austerity\u201d, she says \u2013 and yet a week later her parliament has agreed to a deal that many feel is just as austere as what she said no to. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel betrayed,\u201d says Sklavounou, reiterating her backing for Alexis Tsipras. \u201cHe tried to find a viable solution but he couldn\u2019t do anything else, and I hope he stays in government to try to do some of what he set out to do.\u201d Outside her shop there stands a life-size Playmobil pirate. Inside, though, the big, pricier brands like Playmobil and Lego aren\u2019t shifting. And despite the sales of up to 80% in this shopping district, the footfall in her shop is less than half of what she\u2019d expect for the sales season. The new deal, if it becomes the basis of a new bailout, will make matters worse \u2013 raising corporation tax, and making her pay it in advance. \u201cBut what else can we do?\u201d says Sklavanou. \u201cI said no to austerity \u2013 not no to the EU.\u201d This sense of resignation is mirrored by shoppers at AB Vasilopoulos, a well-known supermarket chain down the road. Customers here face a price-hike for food if the deal goes ahead, with VAT on food set to rise to 23%. At the moment, says 50-year-old Fotini Toli as she leaves with a clutch of groceries, \u201cI\u2019m only buying the things that I need to buy, and nothing extra. I don\u2019t know what will happen now.\u201d But like Sklavounou, Toli is resigned to further austerity. \u201cWe have to choose between the bad and the worse,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so we have to prefer the bad.\u201d Hold the optimism. Reuters is reporting two sources saying they are not so sure a deal will be done. With the officials in the Euro Working Group meeting ahead of the gathering of finance ministers, a Reuters source who said late on Friday he was almost sure an agreement would be reached appeared to have had second thoughts: The high figures for financing needs over the next three years may be too high and too sudden. The second source told Reuters he put the chances of reaching an agreement which would allow talks to begin at 60-40. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor says if a deal is to be done, there needs to be a lot of negotiation, and Alexis Tsipras may end up with tougher demands from the troika (the EU, IMF and ECB) than his predecessors: Sky\u2019s Ed Conway confirms that the proposals appear to be the basis for talks: But he adds: Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, continues to make waves. In a piece for the Guardian he has attacked eurozone policies towards Greece and said German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble wanted the country out of the eurozone: Sch\u00e4uble is convinced that as things stand, he needs a Grexit to clear the air, one way or another... Based on months of negotiation, my conviction is that the German finance minister wants Greece to be pushed out of the single currency to put the fear of God into the French and have them accept his model of a disciplinarian eurozone. The full piece is here: And here\u2019s one interesting reaction: Which has prompted a response from the man himself: Here\u2019s the Bild story (in German). The key part suggests German chancellor Angela Merkel wants an agreement but finance minister Sch\u00e4uble \u201cbelieves Athen\u2019s plans are insufficient and is against further talks.\u201d This is not the first time, of course, that talk of a rift between Merkel and Sch\u00e4uble has emerged. The outcome of the day\u2019s Eurogroup meeting is completely open, according to a German finance ministry spokesman. According to Reuters, Frank Paul Weber refused to comment on a story in Germany\u2019s Bild that finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble thought the Greek proposals were inadequate and he opposed further talks. Weber said: The minister this afternoon will discuss with his eurozone colleagues the assessment of the institutions. The result of the discussion is completely open. There is growing talk that Greece will need more that the \u20ac53bn package it is asking for:| And the Wall Street Journal has reported: Greece will need \u20ac74 billion ($82.55 billion) in fresh funding, the three institutions overseeing the eurozone bailout program said in their assessment of the country\u2019s request for a new aid package, according to three European officials. The \u20ac74 billion could include \u20ac16 billion from the International Monetary Fund, should the Washington-based institution decide to participate in the new aid program, the officials said. A fourth official said some funding could come from Greece raising money on debt markets. Not everyone in Greece is overjoyed about the new proposals, of course, especially given that Sunday\u2019s referendum - was it really less than a week ago - had rejected something very similar. Here\u2019s some pictures from yesterday\u2019s rallies as parliament voted: German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine is also reporting that the Greek proposals have been well received by the institutions, and are a basis for discussion but further steps may be needed (full story here in German). The EU, IMF and ECB are \u201ccautiously positive\u201d, says the report but they want any new bailout programme to contain \u201cstructural benchmarks, milestones and quantitative benchmarks\u201d for the future And the reforms are not enough to meet primary budget surplus targets given the \u201csignificant deterioration in macroeconomic and financial conditions.\u201d The Eurogroup has now listed the press conference following the meeting for 22.00 Brussels time (21.00 BST). That seems to indicate a long meeting. A good sign? As a reminder, here\u2019s what is in the latest Greek proposals, and how they differ from what has gone before: And on Sunday there is a meeting of eurozone leaders and a separate gathering of the whole European Union. If there is an agreement today to start loan talks, Sunday\u2019s summit could well be cancelled although leaders may still want to hear more from Alexis Tsipras about his proposals in the wake of the turbulent events of the last few days. However if there is no sign of a possible deal, then the summit is likely to be dedicated to coping with Greece\u2019s removal from the single currency. Here is the formal agenda for Sunday\u2019s get-together: Following up the special Euro Summit on Greece on 7 July, EU leaders will meet again on Sunday 12 July to take stock of the situation and set out the political guidelines for the next steps. On 7 July, leaders from the euro area member states discussed the situation in Greece following the referendum held on 5 July. President Donald Tusk confirmed that the euro area authorities were ready to do all that is necessary to ensure financial stability in the euro area. This is the way the day ahead is looking. Advisers to the finance ministers were due to begin a meeting of the Euro Working Group at 8.00 GMT (9.00 BST) to discuss the Greek proposals. They will pass on their views to the ministers before the Eurogroup meets at 13.00 GMT (14.00 BST). A reminder of the agenda of the Eurogroup: The Eurogroup will discuss the recent request by the Greek authorities for financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and their new proposals for a reform agenda. The European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will present their assessment of risk to financial stability in the euro area, Greece\u2019s financing needs and the sustainability of its public debt. Based on this assessment ministers will exchange views on whether there is a sufficient basis to start formal negotiations on a new financial assistance programme for Greece. ESM financial assistance programmes are negotiated by the Commission, in liaison with the ECB, on the basis of a mandate by the Eurogroup. When possible, active participation of the IMF is sought. The Eurogroup has confirmed it has received the initial assessment by the institutions - the EU, IMF and ECB - via the spokesman for Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem. More details on the reasons for optimism. The European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund have said the Greek proposals are a basis for negotiation, Reuters is reporting. An unnamed EU official is quoted by the agency as saying: The three institutions have made a first joint assessment of the Greek reform proposals submitted Thursday night. Under certain conditions, they jointly see the proposals as a basis for negotiating an ESM [bailout fund] programme. This assessment was sent to the Eurogroup president last night. Good morning and welcome to what is one of the most crucial weekends since the eurozone crisis began more than five years ago. Finance ministers from the 19 members of the single currency will meet in Brussels later to discuss whether the latest set of Greek proposals are enough to start negotiations on a desperately needed third bailout for the beleaguered country. If they cannot agree, that could be the beginning of the end for Greece as a member of the eurozone, with a summit of EU leaders on Sunday likely to discuss the impact of such a move and how they can deal with the fallout. In that case the European Central Bank would be unlikely to offer any more assistance to Greek banks - which are still shut at the moment - and the country could be plunged into further chaos. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has proposed \u20ac13bn of austerity cuts in return for \u20ac53bn over three years, a plan which effectively amounts to a U-turn after last week\u2019s No vote in the hastily called referendum rejected a pretty similar deal. But late last night Tsipras managed to get the backing of the Greek parliament for his proposals, albeit not without some dissent. After a tense debate 251 MPs out of 300 voted to give Tsipras, and finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, the go-ahead to negotiate with the Eurogroup of finance ministers. But two MPs from the governing Syriza party voted no, eight abstained and seven were absent, which could prove a problem for the getting any agreed measures through law at a later stage. Some in the eurozone, notably in Germany, doubt whether they can trust the Greek government to live up to its promises. Even so, Tsipras claimed the backing of parliament gave his a strong mandate to complete negotiations with the country\u2019s creditors towards a viable solution. Here is our report by Ian Traynor and Graeme Wearden of the night\u2019s drama: And there are some signs that the measures may be enough to restart talks, with EU officials saying today there was a basis for negotiations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
