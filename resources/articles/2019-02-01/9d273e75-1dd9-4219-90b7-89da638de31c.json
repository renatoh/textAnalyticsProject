Grab an office worker from the 1960s, strap them into a time travel machine, and transport them forward 50 years, to the workplace of today. They would feel like they\u2019d arrived on a spaceship. Instead of typing pools, switchboards and secretaries taking notes in shorthand, they\u2019d find laptops, mobile phones and people talking to Siri \u2013 an array of technology that would be almost as befuddling as the concept of female bosses and social networking. If you were to take our mythical time traveller out for a soy latte \u2013 \u201cA what?!?!\u201d \u2013 and give them a brief rundown of the technologies that have come and gone in the past half-century, it might go a little something like this: 1970s \u2022 Brother launches the world\u2019s first high-speed dot matrix printer, the precursor to modern printer technology. \u2022 Colour photocopiers become widespread. \u2022 The fax machine allows one office to instantly send documents to another. \u2022 Electronic calculators shrink so much that you can fit them in your pocket. \u2022 Electronic typewriters with memories allow you to edit text before printing it. \u2022 Word processors offer separate screens and floppy disks for storing documents and programs. \u2022 The first mass-produced \u2018microcomputers\u2019 include the Apple II and Commodore PET. \u2022 Apple launches VisiCalc, a spreadsheet that turns the microcomputer into a business tool. 1980s \u2022 IBM launches its PC and personal computers start to become more widespread; in 1982, Time magazine names the PC its \u2018Man of the Year\u2019. \u2022 Laser printers make office printing quicker and easier. \u2022 The laptop makes PCs portable. \u2022 Mobile phones allow people to make and receive calls on the move. \u2022 Tim Berners-Lee invents the world wide web in 1989. 1990s \u2022 Multi-Function Centres combine printing, scanning faxing and photocopying in a single unit. \u2022 Internet browsers make the world wide web user friendly. \u2022 Email takes off. \u2022 Videoconferencing becomes more affordable and widespread. \u2022 Wi-fi allows computer users to connect to the internet without cables. \u2022 The world wide web opens up. 2000s \u2022 Computers become thousands of times more powerful. \u2022 The internet expands, search engines evolve, and \u2018Google it\u2019 becomes an everyday term. \u2022 The mobile revolution squeezes massive computing power into mobile phones, and make remote work even easier. \u2022 Communication becomes cheaper and more versatile through technology such as instant messaging apps. \u2022 Cloud computing allows everything from data storage to accounting services to be managed off site, and lets workers access systems and information in real time wherever they are. \u2022 The Internet of Things (IoT) \u2013 the connection of previously non-digital devices, such as lights, to digital networks \u2013 starts to make workplaces more efficient. \u2022 Artificial intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly wide range of roles, from analysing data to help business travellers plan trips, to answering customer queries via chatbots. What next? What if we got back in the time machine and teleported into the office of the future? What would we find? A dystopian vision of an AI-run human resources department monitoring microchipped employees\u2019 every move? Or a more appealing scene, in which a worker sits on a beach wearing VR goggles so he can bounce around a few ideas with his fellow creatives? More flexible More flexible working arrangements are certainly likely, says Dean Kendall, General Manager, Sales, Solutions Division, Brother International Australia. \u201cAs technology continues to take us further into a wireless space, the office of the future is going to be both transient and fluid,\u201d Kendall says. \u201cThe term \u2018office\u2019 as we currently know it is being used to describe the physical spaces in which we work. However, as our business operations increasingly shift towards a digital sphere, so will this idea of \u2018the office\u2019.\u201d In other words, thanks to this age of digital connection, the \u2018office\u2019 can be wherever you are. Need to hold a meeting? VR is your friend. Smarter The office of the future is going to be clever. \u201cWe\u2019re headed to a world where our doors unlock when they sense us nearby,\u201d says Silicon Valley venture capitalist Scott Weiss. He\u2019s talking about the Internet of Things, the digital interconnection of previously \u2018dumb\u2019 objects. Chatting with colleagues when you realise you need a hard copy of a report? Just ask the water cooler to print it. Brother expects printers to be an increasingly flexible part of an IoT network in which all sorts of appliances talk to each other. And the data that appliances collect will be used to help design flexible offices that optimise worker welfare and productivity. \u201cOffice spaces will not only become more seamless but also predictive,\u201d Kendall says. It\u2019s possible the meeting room with the slippery dip will be booked, the thermostat set to just how you like it, the sushi ordered and the coffee brewed before you even realise you need to call a meeting. More interesting AI and robots have traditionally been painted as a menacing technology and a lot\u2019s been written about their capacity to steal our jobs (usually en route to enslaving the human race and taking over the planet). There\u2019s no doubt they\u2019re going to shake things up but their impact will likely be far more benign. The World Economic Forum\u2019s 2018 report, The Future of Jobs, predicts that the technological advances of the fourth industrial revolution will displace 75 million jobs by 2022. But it will bring opportunity too, with 133 million new roles created. Technological change also has the potential to make our work lives more interesting, Kendall says. \u201cIf used wisely, these technologies can enhance the work experience of individuals, by taking the \u2018low-level\u2019 repetitive tasks out of their workload. \u201cEach worker will likely have a virtual assistant to support them with various aspects of their jobs, leaving workers with more capacity to engage with high-level \u2018deep work\u2019. No more clearing out your inbox? No more sending out invoices? No more writing reports? If only our VR assistant could tidy our desk too. Now that would be progress.
