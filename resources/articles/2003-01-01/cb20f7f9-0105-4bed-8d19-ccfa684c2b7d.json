Main activity: big cook, small cook The main objective of this session is to ensure the children put all their skills into practice by making their own salad, using the plan they have made together. They must then evaluate their finished product. Tell the children you are going to play \"big cook, small cook\". You are the \"big cook\" and you need to choose a fairly confident member of the class to play the part of \"small cook\". You do a quick demonstration of how to make a salad but get everything wrong, forgetting to wash your hands and the fruit and vegetables, not following the instructions, not looking at what you are doing, etc. Ask the small cook if they think they can do any better and ask the class to contribute suggestions. Ask the class to vote for the best cook by holding up either the \"big cook\" or \"small cook\" side of their cards. This should be a very quick activity, to serve as a reminder of health and safety procedures, before the children begin to make their own salads. Group activity The children return to the groups they worked in during the previous week's session and check their lists to make sure they have everything they need to make their salad. Using their plan, they need to work out a job for everyone to do, so they all make a contribution to the final product. Choose one group (perhaps one that might find this role allocation difficult) and use this group to demonstrate how to split up the activities fairly. Use this opportunity to assess whether the children can select appropriate tools and materials to create their salad. This activity generates a lot of discussion, so you can see whether they are using any of the vocabulary they have become familiar with over the last few weeks. Some friendly advice The children were supposed to be creating a salad to take to a giant's picnic, but they are in for a bit of a shock! When you think their salads are almost complete, tell the children you have received an important message (see pupils' resource, opposite). You need to ask for the children's help because it is quite difficult to understand. The message has been sent to the class marked \"URGENT!\" Go through the message, with the children helping you to translate and correct the mistakes. Discuss what Little Red Riding Hood has told you and tell the class that they had better eat their salads themselves as they've put so much hard work into them. Provide them with a postcard-size piece of card that is blank on both sides. Suggest they draw their salad on one side before it is eaten; after they have eaten the salad they can write a message on the reverse side of the card (see pupils' resource, opposite). You could complete the addresses on the postcards as part of a separate literacy session. Display the postcards on green wool with tissue paper leaves hanging around the classroom to give a \"beanstalk\" effect. Plenary Allow the children time to talk about their salads and the messages they have written to the giants. Discuss what they have enjoyed doing during the project and how they think they could make their salad better next time. Special needs adaptions Arrange the children in mixed- ability groups to complete their tasks. Differentiate the postcard-writing activity according to ability; this could form part of a separate literacy session on writing a longer message or letter. At home Plan a picnic together, look at recipe books to help you decide what to have and write the shopping list. Have a go at making things that require cutting, peeling, grating or blending. Have your picnic and then start working on learning how to tidy and wash up!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
