He had known Councillor Mrs Enid Hattersley in her days of municipal glory and regarded her as the best lord mayor in Sheffield's history. However, a quarter of a century after the end of her years of service, he was still puzzled by one aspect of her illustrious local government career. He found it strange that my mother was Labour. It had not always been so. When young, my mother had been a member of the Communist party and, even in her declining years, she spoke with pride about making tea for AJ Cook when he visited the Derbyshire coalfield during the 1926 general strike. My father - who was never forgiven for voting for the National government in 1931 - did more to change her political allegiance than Stalin's pact with Hitler. But she lived and died a socialist. I was just about to describe the strength of her conviction when I realised that the cause of her admirer's bewilderment was not her ideology but her lifestyle. My mother always wore a hat. For years my father was bullied into cleaning the car each weekend, and regularly mowing the grass (front and back) and sweeping the drive. After he died, my mother did the jobs herself for as long as she could and, like him, always cleared the snow from the stretch of footpath we called our own. In fact, my mother was respectable enough to be a lower-middle-class Tory. If you think that makes my mother sound like Hyacinth Bucket in Keeping Up Appearances, you are wrong. Door-chimes were not her style. But that does not matter. Nor does the idea - absurd as it is offensive - that only Tories keep their brickwork pointed. But the difficulty her admirer found in reconciling my mother's policies and personality revealed a psephological truth that David Cameron would do well to recognise. Thousands, perhaps millions, of Conservatives think that by putting a blue sticker in their window at election time they are demonstrating that they are a cut above their neighbours. Clearly, some Conservatives have a philosophical commitment to the Tory party. They believe in property, patriotism and private enterprise. Others think that it best represents their class interests. But for some voters, support for the Conservatives is the equivalent of a positional good - desirable not because of its intrinsic value but because of what it demonstrates about the owner's place in society. I suppose the idea of Conservatism as a symbol of respectability is strongest among the lower middle classes - the families who are most concerned about their status and least confident about their social acceptability. But there are a lot of them about. If voting Tory is losing its cachet as the badge of the better-quality voter, they may not swing towards the allegedly promiscuous intellectuals and supposedly coarsely spoken roughs and scruffs of Labour. But the Mr and Mrs Buckets will be less likely to turn out and vote on a rainy Thursday night. Class-conscious Conservatives must have been bewildered by the election of 1997, when Labour was led by a public-school gent and the Tory prime minister had problems with his syntax. The Cameron era will have caused them even more perplexity. Some will be proud to follow an old Etonian. Others will listen to his plea for sympathy for \"hoodies\" and tell each other: \"It's all very well for him. He does not live where they hang about the street corners.\" It is not possible to demonstrate conspicuous respectability if you show sympathy and understanding for the sections of the community that are unapologetically disreputable. Unless Cameron appeals to the nastiest (and most pathetic) instincts of the Tory faithful, he is certain to lose some of his core vote. Hague and Howard overdid it. They led a party so overtly nasty that they sacrificed some of the hypocrisy on which Conservatism depends. The enthusiasm for respectability is often camouflage to cover callous greed. But if Cameron relies on soft soap rather than hard ideas, some of his potential support will be submerged in the mush. Pretending that the Conservatives are the \"nice party\" will not work. It is not true. And many Conservative members will not even try to counterfeit love for people they believe to be their social inferiors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
