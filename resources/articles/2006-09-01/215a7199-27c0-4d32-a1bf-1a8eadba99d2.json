Despite an unprecedented warning from the home secretary, John Reid, the duty judge at the high court granted last minute injunctions to five individual Iraqi Kurds, blocking their forcible removal on the direct flight to Iraq which left RAF Brize Norton yesterday afternoon. But all 32 seats on the flight were filled because immigration officials anticipated the possibility of legal challenges and detained and served deportation notices on more people than were due to go. After the five injunctions were granted yesterday morning five more people on the reserve list were put on the flight. Those on board were also understood to include a number of foreign national prisoners - the first to be sent back to Iraq. Maeve Sherlock of the Refugee Council said it was worried about the safety of those sent back: \"Not only has the Home Office made it clear that they are willing to take the risk of returning someone who has legal proceedings outstanding, we cannot be sure that all those returned have had access to legal advice at all.\" The flight was only the second group of Iraqis to be sent back despite the presence of more than 30,000 failed Iraqi asylum seekers in Britain. Last November only 20 out of a group of 70 were sent back because of successful legal challenges. This time Mr Reid warned the high court judges that he would no longer defer a deportation if a last-minute legal challenge was launched unless a full injunction was granted. Despite the much tougher stance by Mr Reid, the Refugee Legal Centre mounted a 48-hour campaign to ensure that the court heard the case against the deportations. It persuaded a high court judge yesterday to grant five out of six of their applications for an injunction. Five names were taken off the flight list but five more \"standby\" cases who were already in detention were put on the flight instead. The flight was expected to land at Irbil in Northern Iraq at 6pm last night. The Home Office had told the judges that because of the complexities, costs and practicalities involved in arranging such charter flights it was essential they were not disrupted or delayed. As a protest was held outside the Home Office yesterday, Amnesty International criticised the return of the asylum seekers to the \"safe area\" of the Kurdish Regional Government. \"Serious human rights violations have been committed in Kurdish areas in northern Iraq, including by Kurdish security forces. To assume that people can be returned to Iraq in safety and with dignity, just because they are returned to Kurdish areas, could have grave implications for people's safety,\" said a spokesperson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
