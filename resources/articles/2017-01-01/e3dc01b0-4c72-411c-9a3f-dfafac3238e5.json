I think we can survive without buying but we\u2019d need to play really well and get our boys back from injury.\u201d Though Moyes had a \u00a310m bid for Robbie Brady turned down by Norwich City this week, Sunderland\u2019s \u00a3140m debt and 19th position in the Premier League both dictate that Allardyce\u2019s successor has strictly limited room for transfer market manoeuvre. Even so, Moyes concedes he is likely to need to sell to buy. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to trust me that I\u2019ll be finding ways to try to balance the books the best I can,\u201d said the manager, who has already reached his limit of two domestic loans after borrowing Adnan Januzaj and Jason Denayer from Manchester United and Manchester City respectively during the summer. \u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019ll probably be looking at free agents and [overseas] loans\u201d Meanwhile Moyes has ordered Vito Mannone, the goalkeeper currently deputising for the injured Jordan Pickford, to up his standards, following a series of recent mistakes. \u201cI\u2019ve told Vito about things he should have saved in the last few games,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve told him I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d Moyes, who also insisted there had been no fresh offers for either Jermain Defoe or Patrick van Aanholt and was unaware of any interest in Kon\u00e9 from Allardyce\u2019s Crystal Palace, will await developments off the pitch as he attempts to secure a first league win in five attempts at West Brom on Saturday. Currently in eighth place, Tony Pulis\u2019s side completed the \u00a310m purchase of Jake Livermore from Hull City on Friday on a four-and-a-half-year deal and the former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder could go straight into the squad to face Sunderland. Moyes believes that Pulis, who could now move for the Angers defender Romain Thomas after Southampton\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Fonte rejected a move to The Hawthorns, deserves real credit for his work since joining the club in January 2015 . He said: \u201cTony has done a good job wherever he has gone. Given time, he always puts together a good team, and he has done. You can see them beginning to build on what they have done and sometimes it takes a little bit of a while to appreciate how good a job he has done.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
