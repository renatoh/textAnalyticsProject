In addition, a fine in the amount of 1,000,000 Swiss francs has been imposed on Mr Karim. The decision was taken today and the terms have been immediately notified to Mr Karim, via the AFF.\u201d In November 2018, the Guardian published detailed allegations of sexual and physical abuse members of the country\u2019s women\u2019s national team say they suffered at the hands of the president, prompting the attorney general\u2019s office in Afghanistan to launch an investigation. Karim and four other members of the federation were suspended and given travel bans. Fifa twice suspended Karim, who strongly denies the allegations, for 90 days at a time. The world governing body said it had begun investigating the claims in March 2018 after having been made aware of the allegations then. However, this week the Guardian revealed it had received copies of emails sent to senior officials within Fifa and the Asian Football Confederation, including one from 34 AFF provincial presidents, alerting them to possible sexual abuse, and alleging corruption and abuse of a 14-year-old boy as early as April 2017. A Fifa spokeswoman, asked about the emails, said: \u201cIn early 2018, Fifa was made aware of sexual abuse allegations and immediately began to investigate these serious matters in a way that would ensure, first and foremost, the safety and security of the victims and their families. \u201cAlleged representatives of the Afghan provincial associations sent emails to various staff in Fifa which made allegations which proved difficult to verify for two reasons: 1. The attachments/enclosures mentioned in the emails were never provided and 2. Fifa staff could not travel to Afghanistan for a fact-finding mission due to the serious security constraints within the country.\u201d She added that Fifa was \u201cstrongly committed to promoting the safety and well-being of all individuals involved in football activities\u201d and had \u201ca zero-tolerance policy on human rights violations and condemns all forms of gender-based violence\u201d. The AFC said: \u201cIssues with the Afghanistan Football Federation should be addressed to them. The matter surrounding the allegations against certain members of the AFF is being addressed by Fifa.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
