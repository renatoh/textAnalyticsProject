United play at home against Leeds on Sunday, travel to Leicester on Boxing Day and host Wolves three days later then Aston Villa on 1 January. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side also visit Everton in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals next Wednesday, making it a packed schedule. The manager was asked whether this could define United\u2019s hopes of competing for the championship. \u201cThis is a big run of games for us,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter Villa on New Year\u2019s Day, we have a little bit of a break in the league [for the FA Cup]. This period is going to be vital and it\u2019ll be easier for me to answer around that time \u2013 I\u2019d be disappointed if the players didn\u2019t think we can put a challenge up. \u201cAt the moment, anything goes in the league. There\u2019s different reasons for different results. I feel we\u2019re getting better but we have to improve quite a bit to take that next step as well.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r, reflecting on whether the league\u2019s uneven results made this United\u2019s best chance of claiming a 21st title since Sir Alex Ferguson retired seven years ago, said: \u201cThis season is going to be very up and down. Whoever finds the consistency and the energy will have a better chance than in the last few seasons, because there\u2019s been a few runaway teams. \u201cFor us, the quicker we can get the game in hand against Burnley played the better so that the league table looks as it should be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
