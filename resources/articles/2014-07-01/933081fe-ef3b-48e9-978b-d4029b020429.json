As he unveiled his defence strategy for a potentially definitive appeal which could see him and Knox definitively convicted of the British student's killing in 2007, the 30-year-old Italian said he still believed \"to this day in the innocence of Amanda Marie Knox\". But, in what some read as a sign he is preparing to distance himself from his former lover after six-and-a-half years of rigidly joint defence, he added: \"But obviously, in what I read in the court papers, I register certain anomalies.\" While saying she hoped both convictions would be quashed by Italy's supreme court, Sollecito's lawyer, Giulia Bongiorno, urged the judges to take \"coherent and consequent decisions\" if they felt there were contradictions in the appeal court's sentence, and not to \"automatically extend anomalies pertaining to Amanda to Sollecito\". At a press conference in Rome on Tuesday, Sollecito acknowledged, as he has done previously, that he cannot be absolutely certain of how much time the 27-year-old student from Seattle spent in his flat on the early part of the evening of the murder, even if he is certain the two spent the night together. The pair have always said their memories were foggy due to the effects of cannabis. Sollecito's appeal, said Bongiorno, focused on a text message which Knox says she sent from her then boyfriend's home at 8.35pm the evening of the murder but which the Florence court, in its reasoning, accepts was sent from outside. \"According to the sentence, this [SMS] was not written from Raffaele's house. Therefore the two were not together,\" said Bongiorno. She added that, from her client's point of view, the discrepancy was \"either the nth mistake of the sentence, or 'I [Sollecito] was lied to, too.'\" She added that his defence team had estimated that the attack on Kercher took place between 9pm and 9.30pm \u2013 though a time of death has never been agreed on and prosecutors have argued it occurred later. Sollecito says evidence from his computer proves he was at his home until at least 9.26pm. Another hinge of his defence is a memo written by Knox in which she admitted to confusion over earlier statements in which she had falsely accused bar owner Patrick Lumumba of the murder, said she was present at her house and heard the 21-year-old Leeds University student \"screaming\". She later retracted the statements. Sollecito said he did not believe the contents of the \"odd, eccentric\" memo, but that as the Florence appeals court \u2013 which reinstated the pair's guilty verdicts in January \u2013 appeared to draw on parts of it for the convictions, he was forced to respond to that version of events. \"For me this memo recounts only fantasies and figments of the imagination,\" he said. \"But if what were written in the memo were true, taking it as a given that the judges are right [to use it in their verdict], could you explain to me where I figure in it?\" He added: \"What is my participation? What is my motive, my involvement, anything? Explain it to me, because my name is Raffaele Sollecito and not Amanda Marie Knox.\" Both Knox and Sollecito \u2013 who were cleared of the murder by an appeal court in 2011, only for that ruling to be quashed by the supreme court \u2013 insist they are innocent. The Florence court upheld the original convictions imposed by a court in Perugia in 2009, and sentenced Knox to 28 years and six months in prison. The new appeals at the court of cassation could, if unsuccessful, bring the long-running legal saga to an end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
