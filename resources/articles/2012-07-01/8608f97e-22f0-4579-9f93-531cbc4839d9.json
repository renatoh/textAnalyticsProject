The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors said fewer people put their homes up for sale and demand for housing remains weak.Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist, said: \"The housing market didn't manage to turn a corner last month and activity remained in the doldrums.\" Almost two thirds of surveyors said house prices failed to pick up in the three months to June; while 22% more surveyors reported a fall in house prices than those reporting a rise. That is the gloomiest reading for the past eight months and compares with 17% more surveyors posting price declines in May. Surveyors are also more pessimistic about where house prices will go in the coming year. Asked how they expect them to change over the next 12 months, 19% more surveyors said they expected a fall rather than a rise in prices, compared with just 8% in May. RICS said all of its indicators showed a market in decline, following the temporary flurry of activity before the end of the stamp duty holiday in March. Newly agreed sales slowed for three consecutive months. Some 12% more surveyors reported falls rather than rises in newly agreed sales, compared with 5% last month. The average number of completed sales slipped, the number of properties up for sale fell back, and surveyors reported fewer buyer enquiries. The only glimmer of hope was an improvement in the number of surveyors expecting sales to edge up, with 11% more predicting an increase in transactions, compared with 9% in May. Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist, said: \"Although there is some positivity that the amount of sales going through is going to see an increase, it is unlikely that we will see any real movement until purchasing a property is more affordable and accessible for the likes of first time buyers.\" But Britons splashed out on smaller items over the jubilee weekend, helping to lift retail sales by 2.1% in the second quarter. Stephen Robertson, of the British Retail Consortium, said: \"It was the bunting boost. June was saved by the feelgood lift of the jubilee, showing how crucial these temporary factors are in our difficult trading conditions.\" \"A trip to the shops played a big part in preparations for the occasion. The week leading up to the long weekend was a stand-out for the retail sector. Food and clothing and footwear retailers had the best of it, as people bought in special food and drink and, encouraged by warmer weather, some treated themselves to shorts, dresses and sandals.\" The BRC said the rest of the month was much more challenging, and economists will be disappointed by a 0.1% decline in like-for-like sales over the quarter. Robertson said: \"It's clear a permanent upturn in confidence and spending has yet to happen.\" Britons remembered their concerns about the economy, jobs and personal finances and cut back on big purchases. Demand for summer dresses and barbecues also slipped as the rain continued to fall, making it the wettest June on record. The rain did, however, boost internet shopping. Online sales of goods, excluding food, rose 12.1% in June, compared with growth of 11.5% last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
