One disaffected fan, who prefers to remain anonymous, knows exactly who to blame - Goldenballs himself. \"For some reason, the English sports media cannot come to terms with the fact that football is not played on the back pages of newspapers,\" says Mr X. \"They keep on touting Beckham for qualities he does not have. Look, this is a player the Spanish press derisively dismissed as Forrest Gump.\" French fans never miss a chance to put down the English. For Olivier Mercier, there are three burning questions: \"Will David Beckham retire after Euro 2004? Will Sven-Goran Eriksson kill himself before Thursday? Will England at least stop trying to play football and rugby?\" Monsieur Mercier's advice? \"Keep on playing cricket - you may win that.\" Back in Blighty, Charles M. still believes England could win the competition but on one, no make that two, conditions: NO James, NO Heskey. \"Gerrard succumbed to the 'silly mistake' syndrome that afflicts most English players, but the goalkeeper forgot even the most basic of training ground drills - stay on your feet and make the striker beat you. His lunge, if you look at it on replay, shows him not even looking at the ball. His sad demeanour as he left the pitch was even more annoying - Calamity Rides Again.\" Emile Heskey doesn't escape from his criticism either. \"He must have something on the manager,' claims Charles. \"Either that or he truly, truly is a talent which I just cannot perceive. I cannot imagine what was in his mind in the micro-seconds before he kicked Henry in the chest 20 metres from the goal - with 'that' goalkeeper between the sticks.\" The next challenge for England is the match against Switzerland. Emanuel Guhirwa believes the Swiss defence has been under-rated. \"Patrick Muller is probably the most under-rated of the Swiss defence,\" says Patrick, noting his \"usually assured performances\" in the Champions League over the last three seasons. \"His positioning is very good and he has often covered the poor positioning of Hakin in the Swiss defence,\" continues Patrick. \" I am surprised that none of the big European teams have tried to sign him.\" Elsewhere, German fans have been buoyed by their team's performance against Holland. \"We may lack a superstar,\" says Rainer Vogel, \"but even in bad times, Germany wins championships or reaches finals. \"At any given time any German team can beat even the strongest competition,\" he adds. As if that wasn't enough, he continues: \"Euro 2004 is only preparation for the World Cup two years from now. Which is why one of the youngest German teams ever is playing. So not at all bad!\" No Rainer, not bad at all. And finally, the Portuguese perspective. Alas not on the football, however, but on the behaviour of English fans. Does Ricardo Sousa from Lisbon think England should be thrown out of Euro 2004? \"With news of incidents in the Algarve every morning, many Portuguese, including myself, are starting to think that yes, they should be sent home. \"We are all making an effort for this to be a nice tournament. People are coming from all over Europe to enjoy their stays and have fun together. What are these drunk people contributing?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
