Comedy venues have been luring in customers with affordable tickets and topical stand-up routines on the economic downturn, according to the ticketing agency WeGotTickets. The seller of music, theatre and other tickets has seen a surge in comedy ticket sales over the last 18 months and is now selling more than 6,000 a month. Comedy makes up about 15% of total revenue for the agency, despite representing just 10% of events on sale. The rise has prompted the company to create WeGotComedy, which it claims is the UK's first ticketing website solely dedicated to comedy events. The new portal will be launched today at the Edinburgh festival fringe, where the agency is selling tickets for 40 shows. \"We have seen a groundswell in comedy to the point where we feel we can give comedy events a bit more marketing clout,\" says Dave Newton, WeGotTickets co-founder. He says comedy has benefited from being a cheap night to put on for smaller venues such as pubs, from being easier to get to and pay for than big concerts and from being relevant to the audience. \"Comedy is always going to be contemporary, so the content can resonate with the audience.\" In response to the downturn, comedian Frank Skinner has launched a Credit Crunch Cabaret featuring big names and circuit comedians, with tickets just \u00a310 to attract cash-strapped punters. Elsewhere, venues such as the Comedy Store chain in London have reported rising profits as City financiers flock to hear stand-ups take on the banking crisis. Newton sees more comedy nights springing up and wants to go from 800 comedy events on sale now to 2,000-3,000 by this time next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
