Gaza Four children have died in a deadly Israeli air strike on Gaza port: \"We were playing hide and seek when we were hit. I didn't hear the first one which killed one of us but I heard the second as we were running along the beach. That one killed three more.\" Hamas has called for international action over the deaths; Gaza officials say that 207 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have died in the Israeli offensive since July 8. Israel has accepted a UN proposal to hold fire for a five-hour \"humanitarian window\" tomorrow, with Hamas still considering the proposal. The military confrontation is being mirrored in a social media battle, with both sides taking to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to denounce the other and present their own side of the story. Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu has fired deputy defence minister Danny Danon for saying Hamas humiliated Israel by setting peace conditions, amid criticism of his handling of the crisis by his senior ministers. He has also accused Hamas of \"shutting the door to a diplomatic solution\" as he prepares to authorise the call-up of 8,000 more reserve soldiers.
