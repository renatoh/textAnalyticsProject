It's a collection of reworked versions of his much-adored songs, and his first entirely acoustic effort. All of which rings the alarm \u2013 Wolf is known for his bombast, his dramatic flourishes, and many of these are machine-made. Stripping them back and having another go risks taking off too many layers, including the magic. Thankfully, this isn't Wolf thumbing his nose at his past. The all-new Together employs Spanish guitar and strings in place of the original's 80s electro pulse, and shines a new light on its mood, making it celebratory where it once felt mournful. Elsewhere, the revisions temper the mood \u2013 Bermondsey Street becomes louche, while Bluebells is given new maturity. It's hard to shake the feeling, though, that it's all a bit self-indulgent. These rewrites, though confident, are as much a curiosity as anything else, more an exercise in shape and form than an improvement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
