Faced with independent evidence of the effort needed to achieve the prime minister's 1999 pledge, John Hutton, the work and welfare secretary, will say that Labour will target back-to-work assistance so families with children are placed first in the queue for help in getting jobs. The report, by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, says the government would need to spend \u00a34bn to halve child poverty by 2010 and a further \u00a328bn to eradicate it over the subsequent decade. Ministers believe the cost could be lowered by welfare-to-work policies and Mr Hutton has asked his employment minister, Jim Murphy, to look at the idea that single claimants and claimants without children should come second, especially when considering help for people stuck on incapacity benefit. Ministers privately acknowledge they do not have the resources to spread the pathways to work programme for those on incapacity benefit to everyone, and targeting families with children for help will be a way of setting priorities and trying to hit child poverty targets. The foundation's report says Labour's attempts to tackle the legacy of child poverty left by the Tories in 1997 would stall unless ministers step up their campaign to lift poor families above the breadline. Donald Hirsch, the author, said it would cost \u00a332bn to ensure only 5% of children were living in households on less than 60% of the UK median income. That would match the best European performance, but Mr Hirsch said meeting the target through more generous tax credits and benefits was not feasible because the scale of the increases would appear unjust and massive increases in benefits might affect incentives to work. \"These targets cannot be met through benefits alone. Families must be helped to improve their market earnings, at the same time as getting extra assistance if their incomes fall short. While the cost of ending child poverty is high, the cost of not succeeding is even greater and costs escalate from one generation to the next.\" He added: \"A big investment to wipe out child poverty once and for all will bring benefits for generations to come.\" The report says steady increases in benefits would be needed if the government was to build on the progress made since 1997. It would be possible to meet the 2010 target through redistribution but achieving the 2020 target would require a boost to the earnings of the in-work poor, family-friendly employment policies to help lone parents and investment in tackling educational underachievement. Following the more than doubling of child poverty between 1979 and 1997, Mr Hirsch said Labour's record since had been impressive given that it was aiming at a moving target which was steadily growing. He stressed, however, that on unchanged policies Mr Blair would only just about meet the narrowly missed 2005 target by 2020. Last night the government made it clear it accepted that more needed to be done, although strenuous attempts to put single parents back to work would mean the cost would not be as high as the foundation's report suggested. Gordon Brown is keen to launch an anti-child poverty campaign in the autumn to replicate the success of the Make Poverty History coalition in pushing the case for increased help for Africa. \"Almost a million children have been lifted out of poverty since 1997,\" the chancellor told the Guardian. \"If we can build a public campaign similar to Make Poverty History we can do even better.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
