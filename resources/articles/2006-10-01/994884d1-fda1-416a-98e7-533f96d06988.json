Here, though, the Bible is against them, for nowhere do we find an exemplary marriage explored in depth; nobody to whom a parish priest could point a young couple in a marriage interview and say: \"Be like them.\" Almost everywhere in the Bible it is assumed that men are worth more than women; the book presumes that power and authority lie with men, including that over women, and asserts openly that men must exercise such authority. Only in one place in its exploration of relations between women and men does it place them on an equal footing and protest against the brutalities and nonsense of patriarchy. The Song of Songs, a series of erotic poems, composed almost certainly by women, celebrates the subversive, pre-marital sexual love of a pair of teenagers, where the girl has escaped the confines of the family - and the brothers who would board her up to protect her virginity - and has run into the arms of the boy she loves. It contains some of the most beautiful love poetry ever written, but not quite what those who insist sex be confined within heterosexual marriage are looking for. The Bible also celebrates same-sex relationships, despite what those persuaded by a few verses in Leviticus and the epistles might believe. Theodore W Jennings Jr describes the meeting of Jonathan with David in the first book of Samuel as \"love at first sight\" - at least on Jonathan's part. We are dealing, he says, \"with no platonic friendship, but with all the elements of passionate romance\". If we see Jonathan and David as two men passionately in love with one another - Jonathan from the first, and David once he has transferred his affections and loyalty from his wife, Michal, to Jonathan - then many details in the text, including the precise Hebrew terms it uses, which are drawn from erotic love poetry such as the Song of Songs, fall into place. But even the David and Jonathan stories cannot rival the story of Ruth and Naomi. Ruth's declaration of love for Naomi is not only one of the finest and most profound in the Bible, it is the only speech in scripture that approaches our wedding vows. Indeed it goes beyond them, exceeding the promise of \"till death do us part\". And it brings Naomi back to life. Naomi is sunk in bitter grief and despair, but as the story unfolds we witness her resurrection, until at the end the women of Bethlehem celebrate her and Ruth as a couple, and declare of the child born to Ruth and Boaz: \"A son has been born to Naomi\", as if Naomi is the father and the husband. The book of Ruth is the great love story of the Bible and it is a story of love between women - Ruth's marriage to Boaz is entered into only to protect the relationship between the women and ensure their survival. The reality of such gay and lesbian partnerships is that if they were heterosexual, we would unhesitatingly call them \"good marriages\". In a society which can be so casual about infidelity and so careless of the consequences, which does not quite know how to value friendship or affirm its importance, where so many children are given televisions in their bedrooms but are starved of time with their parents, and where the horrors and the prevalence of domestic violence are only beginning to be faced, the Church has enough that is challenging to say, enough hard words to speak, without condemning loving homosexual couples. \u00b7 Trevor Dennis is vice dean of Chester Cathedral.
