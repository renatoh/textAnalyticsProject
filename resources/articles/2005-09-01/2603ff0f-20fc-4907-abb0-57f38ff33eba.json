The results of Wednesday's poll have yet to be officially confirmed by the election commission, however it has always been a near-certainty that the 77-year-old Mr Mubarak would win. One government-run newspaper, al-Akhbar, hailed the victory as evidence that Mr Mubarak, who has been in power for 24 years, had obtained the \"trust and support of the people\" with his democratic reforms. In reality, many Egyptians were cynical about the election and the papers indicated that turnout was likely to have been low, perhaps under 30%. The electoral commission rejected a request yesterday from one of the nine other candidates, the liberal Ghad party leader Ayman Nour, that the election should be rerun because of claims of fraud. Some voters said they were urged by electoral workers at polls to vote for him; others said they were offered bribes of food. Commentators said that Mr Mubarak's huge party machine had assured him of victory. But Mr Nour, who spent time in prison earlier this year after being detained by authorities, has made some progress in the elections. If the vote assessments in the Egyptian newspapers are accurate, the poll will have confirmed Mr Nour, a charismatic and outspoken lawyer, as the main secular opposition figure. The Muslim Brotherhood, the country's main political force after Mr Mubarak's party, was not allowed to field a presidential candidate. The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, called Mr Mubarak today to congratulate him and thank him for the \"positive role\" he had played in Israel's peace process with the Palestinians, Mr Sharon's office said. Analysts said that the Egyptian elections were flawed but were nevertheless a move away from authoritarian rule towards democracy. In the past, Mr Mubarak, who has already served four six-year terms, has been returned to power in referendums where voters were merely given a \"yes\" or \"no\" vote. Mr Mubarak's reforms follow criticism of Egypt from the US, a key ally, and other countries, and he had promised more reforms if he won. But many in Egypt believe that the first proper democratic elections will be when Mr Mubarak's term ends in 2011, assuming he does not seek a sixth term."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
