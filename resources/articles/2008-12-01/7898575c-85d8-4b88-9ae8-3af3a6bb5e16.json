The US central bank set its target range for the federal funds rate to between zero to 0.25%, citing deteriorating economic conditions. That is down from the 1% target rate set at its October meeting. The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks lend money to each other, usually overnight. \"Since the committee's last meeting, labour market conditions have deteriorated, and the available data indicate that consumer spending, business investment, and industrial production have declined,\" the Federal Reserve said in a statement accompanying the announcement. \"Financial markets remain quite strained and credit conditions tight. Overall, the outlook for economic activity has weakened further.\" The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, the bank's governing body, pledged to use \"all available tools\" to reinvigorate the US economy and maintain price stability, anticipates keeping the rate low for \"some time\". Also, the Fed lowered to 0.5% the discount rate, which is the rate at which the Federal Reserve lends money to private banks. US stock markets rallied with news of the Fed's moves. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of blue-chip securities on the New York Stock Exchange was up 240.46 points, or 2.81%, to 8,804.99. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index was up 53.31 points, or 3.53%, to 1,561.65."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
