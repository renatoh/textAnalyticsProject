Either way, we could see something memorable and it could come about as soon as Monday\u2019s Game 5 when the series continues, and possibly concludes, in Toronto. One can only imagine what the atmosphere will be like then. We will continue to cover the NBA Finals here at the Guardian until its conclusion, but this will be all of today\u2019s live coverage. Thanks to everybody for following along, particularly those who contributed. Ciao! Still this wasn\u2019t about the Warriors losing, although that might be the sexier story, it was about a great game played by the Raptors. Despite a disjointed first half performance, the Raptors found themselves in the second half. Kawhi Leonard had a spectacular game, he scored 36 points and racked up 12 rebounds, and Serge Ibaka was absolutely ridiculous of the bench. Right now, they very much look like the better team, with an emphasis on \u201cteam.\u201d Email from Dan Carter: So this is the whole story, right? Toronto can own the \u2018regular\u2019 warriors, but Durant comes back at 1-3 down and they take it 4-3, assuring his status as an all timer, rather than a bandwagon-er. Well that\u2019s the hope for the Warriors but there\u2019s a lot of \u201cifs\u201d there and, again, two of the next three potential games will be in Toronto. Certainly, Kevin Durant will be the big story over the next few days. The Toronto Raptors have taken a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals. Can you believe it? The Golden State Warriors are now a game away from elimination and we may have seen the last game ever played at Oracle Arena. Raptors 105-92 Warriors, FINAL Raptors just showing off not. Siakam rattles one home from around ten feet. At that point, both sides realize its over and Toronto holds for the final buzzer. The Raptors win! Raptors 103-92 Warriors, 1:28, 4th quarter Lowry gets the fans to start heading for the exits with his shot. Curry keeps things something close to interesting by completing a three-point play. Raptors 101-89 Warriors, 1:53, 4th quarter Siakam with a jumper. That might be the game right there. Raptors 99-89 Warriors, 2:48, 4th quarter Curry hits a three-pointer! There\u2019s life still here. Draymond Green decides to immediately suck all the momentum out of the game by pushing Siakam who goes to the line where he nails both of them. Just a completely boneheaded foul by Green. Raptors 97-86 Warriors, 3:05, 4th quarter Kawhi Leonard? He doesn\u2019t miss free throws. He increases Toronto\u2019s lead by beyond-calmly hitting two. Curry gets the points right back for the Warriors. They still have a pulse. Raptors 95-84 Warriors, 3:43, 4th quarter In other news, VanVleet has gotten stitched up and apparently doesn\u2019t have a concussion, which is good news. He\u2019s on the bench here. Iguodala gets to the line and makes\u2026 one of two free throws. Raptors fans are starting to feel it. Raptors 95-83 Warriors, 4:19, 4th quarter Missed opportunity for the Warriors to cut Toronto\u2019s lead into single-digits. Looney gets to the line but can\u2019t convert either shot. Inevitably, the Raptors respond. They keep a possession alive thanks to a Danny Green rebound and Siakam makes a layup. The Warriors call a timeout. Raptors 93-83 Warriors, 4:54, 4th quarter The Warriors start to chip away a bit after Draymond banks a shot home and Curry gets to the line where he makes both. It\u2019s a 10-point game and there\u2019s still plenty of time, especially considering Golden State\u2019s weapons. Raptors 93-81 Warriors, 6:08, 4th quarter The crowd gets loud at a Klay Thompson three-pointer but there\u2019s no stopping Serge Ibaka in this half and he lands a tremendous dunk to raise his total to 20 points. Raptors 91-76 Warriors, 7:34, 4th quarter Danny Green breaks his oh-fer with a trademark ridiculous three-pointer. Email from Kai Soltys, on the VanVleet injury: Fine the floor $500 000 and suspend it for a season Raptors 88-76 Warriors, 7:48, 4th quarter Can\u2019t say anything bad about Kevon Looney in this game. Draymond Green finds him for an alley-oop dunk and that\u2019s going to be enough to get Toronto to calm things down with a timeout. Raptors 88-74 Warriors, 8:19, 4th quarter Draymond Green gets Kawhi Leonard to pick up his fourth foul. Green grinds out two more free throws. Every one of those might be crucial for the Warriors. Raptors 88-72 Warriors, 8:33, 4th quarter Leonard with a three-pointer and it\u2019s a 16 point lead and\u2026 is this actually about to get away from the Warriors? Are we witnessing the end of an era right here and now? Raptors 85-72 Warriors, 8:57, 4th quarter Ibaka scores again and picks up a foul. He\u2019s not going to miss that free throw, not in this game. Raptors 82-72 Warriors, 9:35, 4th quarter VanVleet walks to the back on his own, he looks shaken up from the hit and I\u2019m shaken up just looking at him to be honest. Meanwhile, Ibaka has picked up a foul that puts Shaun Livingston on the line. He makes both free throws. Raptors 82-70 Warriors, 9:35, 4th quarter The two teams go on one of those offensive-challenged stretches of play before VanVleet hits the floor and he\u2019s bleeding from the eye. Raptors 82-70 Warriors, 11:28, 4th quarter Okay this is starting to get into dangerous territory for Golden State. VanVleet nails a three right off the bat, but Thompson does promptly answer. Email from Redmond Grimes: I was at the TFc game tonight. They are showing the Raptors on the big screen at the stadium and the beer is still flowing! I have to imagine that it\u2019s getting pretty loud after that offensive explosion. Raptors 79-67 Warriors, end of the 3rd quarter Leonard adds to the Raptors lead: two free throws and another jumper. The Warriors need to get something going here and it\u2019s going to be on Steph. He completes a three-point play after drawing a foul on Ibaka that cuts the lead to 10 points. There\u2019s no stopping Leonard though. The Raptors hold for the last shot before getting the ball to their main guy as VanVleet finds him for the final basket of the quarter. What a quarter for the Raptors who score 37 points in the frame. Raptors 73-64 Warriors, 1:21, 3rd quarter Ibaka has been Toronto\u2019s secret weapon. He scores again and it\u2019s an 8 point lead for the Raptors. Steph Curry gets to the line and, somehow, misses one of two free throws. That helps the Warriors a bit but it would help them more if they could stop Ibaka who scores YET again. Raptors 69-63 Warriors, 2:14, 3rd quarter Leonard gets back to the line where he should be paying rent. He hits both free throws to increase the Raptors lead. Phil Rawlinson: Hi hunter I am really enjoying this series but am a bit of a novice. With my ignorant hat on, it seems unfair one team has steph curry, hes really quite good. And yet Toronto are right at them I appreciate this adds nothing but I want Toronto to win Steph Curry really is a Human Cheat Code. Raptors 67-63 Warriors, 2:50, 3rd quarter You\u2019ll never believe it but Draymond Green just picked up a technical foul for saying something to an official. Leonard takes the technical free throw for Toronto and drills it. He also makes the next Raptors\u2019 basket. Warriors want another timeout here. \u201cRight Place, Wrong Time\u201d takes us to the commercial break. R.I.P. Dr. John, the Night Tripper. Raptors 64-63 Warriors, 3:17, 3rd quarter Curry gets to the line and of course he makes both free throws. What else do you expect from him? Raptors 64-61 Warriors, 4:00, 3rd quarter Siakam goes to the line for free throws and makes both. We\u2019re all tied up which sounds about right, neither team seems quite able to break away from the other. Although Ibaka wants to change that he hits a three to give the Raptors their biggest lead of the game. Raptors 59-61 Warriors, 4:29, 3rd quarter Thompson hits another three. Quite a different half here. And Lowry lands on his ankle awkwardly. He stays in the game however. Raptors 59-58 Warriors, 5:32, 3rd quarter Out of the timeout, Iguodala misses a layup. Gasol hits a three-pointer and the see-saw second half continues. Raptors 56-58 Warriors, 6:14, 3rd quarter Wow, an incredible block by Draymond Green on Pascal Siakam to prevent an easy score. The Warriors take a timeout. Raptors 56-58 Warriors, 6:39, 3rd quarter Draymond Green fouls Siakam on a made basket. Unlike Cousins, he completes the old-fashioned three pointer and the Raptors regain a lead for the blink of an eye before Thompson hits one from downtown. Raptors 53-55 Warriors, 7:36, 3rd quarter Raptors have regained their long-distance shooting. VanVleet nails his first three-pointer and then\u2026 should pick up a foul on the next position it feels like. Instead the Raptors end up turning the ball over. Raptors 50-55 Warriors, 8:29, 3rd quarter And Iguodala blocks a Kyle Lowry three out of bounds. Hey look, DeMarcus Cousins is doing something good too! He hits a jumper and picks up a foul\u2026 but he doesn\u2019t make the free throw to complete the three-point play. Raptors 50-53 Warriors, 9:33, 3rd quarter Gasol with a jumper, Toronto back up front for a split second. It doesn\u2019t last. Thompson scores yet again and, oh hey, Andre Iguodala sighting, he unleashes a vicious dunk. Raptors 48-49 Warriors, 10:36, 3rd quarter Leonard hits two three-pointers and just like that they have the lead. Briefly, Curry hits his first three of the game. Okay, this is looking more like what we were expecting. Raptors 42-46 Warriors, 12:00, 3rd quarter And the second half has begun! Email from Phil Rawlinson: Hi hunter Hope you are well. What do you call a donkey with three legs? Wonkey While I don\u2019t think this is actually related to this game in the slightest, this is also the punchline for \u201cWhat do you call a non-Kawhi Raptors player\u2019s shot for three points.\u201d The good news for the Warriors? The miraculous recoveries of Thompson and Looney: How bizarre was that first half offensively? There were exactly four three-pointers made. Leonard hit two for Toronto, Thompson hit two for the Warriors. That\u2019s it. How is that even possible? Is everybody tired? Raptors 42-46 Warriors, end of the first half And that will do it for the first half. What a sloppy weird first half. Warriors have the lead, the Raptors are right behind them though. Raptors 42-46 Warriors, 33.2 Gasol with a dunk and the Warriors cannot get much separation from the Raptors, who they\u2019re out-playing in just about every respect. Who knows where\u2019d they be without Looney, who dunks on Golden State\u2019s end. Lowry gets fouled and makes both free throws. Raptors 38-44 Warriors, 2:02, 2nd quarter Marc Gasol\u2019s been dead quiet, but he gets to the line and dutifully knocks down his free throws. Raptors 36-44 Warriors, 2:02, 2nd quarter Curry scores and we hit another stretch where neither team looks like they know what they\u2019re doing offensively. This has\u2026 this has not been super-great basketball to be honest. The Oracle crowd is appreciating it though. Raptors 36-42 Warriors, 3:31, 2nd quarter Lowry takes out his anger at the Warriors\u2019 ownership with a quick basket out of the timeout. Thompson can\u2019t connect on the other end this time around. Raptors 34-42 Warriors, 3:48, 2nd quarter Thompson drills another three. That\u2019s 12 points for him already. Wait, he just scored again, make that 14 points. Raptors are going to call a timeout. Raptors 34-37 Warriors, 4:40, 2nd quarter Curry with a jumper and Ibaka continues his great quarter by corralling a rebound and depositing it in the basket with a little hook shot. Lowry adds two free throws to Toronto\u2019s total and it\u2019s a one-possession game. Raptors 30-35 Warriors, 5:42, 2nd quarter Draymond Green scores and Oracle gets on their feet. Every time they seem to do that, the Raptors manage to score. This time around Siakam drives to the basket, finishes on the rim and picks up a foul. He successfully completes the three-point play at the line. Raptors 27-33 Warriors, 6:18, 2nd quarter Thompson scores out of the timeout. Medical staff looking pretty good right now for the Warriors. McKinnie gets fouled by Lowry, who has been fouling a bunch this series. He misses both free throws though. Raptors 27-31 Warriors, 6:59, 2nd quarter Thompson with a jumper, he doesn\u2019t look too bad either. Danny Green misses yet another shot, he hasn\u2019t a single one. Meanwhile, Livingston has made another. Golden State definitely playing with more energy now. And as soon as I type that, Toronto find a bit of a spark thanks to back-to-back baskets by VanVleet and Siakam and the Warriors are going to want to take a timeout here. Raptors 23-27 Warriors, 8:38, 2nd quarter Shaun Livingston scores for the Warriors and Ibaka hits his third shot of the quarter, a long two. Raptors 21-25 Warriors, 9:25, 2nd quarter Cousins and Ibaka trade baskets and then both teams go on one of those weird stretches where they can\u2019t score. Not really a smooth game so far. Raptors 19-23 Warriors, 11:32, 2nd quarter It looks like that Curry shot didn\u2019t beat the shot clock, so they take it off the board. Ibaka then makes the first shot of the game. That\u2019s one way to cut a lead down real quick on just one made basket. Raptors 17-25 Warriors, end of the 1st quarter Curry\u2019s layup is no good but Looney\u2019s tip-in is great. Raptors need a score here and, no surprise, it\u2019s Leonard who provides the spark by hitting two straight shots. That will do it for the first quarter. A crazy shot but a dominant stretch by the Warriors towards the end. Raptors 12-23 Warriors, 1:43, 1st quarter Alfonzo McKinnie scores and the Warriors already have a double-digit lead. Raptors 12-21 Warriors, 2:18, 1st quarter Raptors just have 2.9 to score but that\u2019s enough time for Leonard to heave up a shot to cut into the Warriors lead but Looney scores again. I guess that second opinion he got from the doctors wasn\u2019t a lie. Curry adds to the lead with a shot that may or may not have escaped being a shot clock violation. I\u2019ve hit the Stockholm Syndrome portion of watching the NBA Finals where I\u2019m starting to be curious about these cheesy ABC shows. Extreme mini-golf? I\u2019m starting to come around to the idea. Raptors 10-17 Warriors, 4:06, 1st quarter Leonard gets called on a foul. Draymond Green goes to the line and he\u2019s automatic as usual. Curry gets another three after a Fred VanVleet miss and the Raptors are going to cash in a timeout right here. Raptors 10-13 Warriors, 4:39, 1st quarter Klay Thompson with a beautiful three that\u2019s immediately answered by Lowry. Raptors 7-10 Warriors, 6:02, 1st quarter Danny Green misses an open look, proof that it sometimes happens. An alley-oop to Looney who scores to a huge hand from the Warriors fans. Leonard gets to the line, something he\u2019s been doing frequently this entire postseason, making both of his free throws. Raptors 5-8 Warriors, 6:45, 1st quarter Draymond Green makes the first bucket of the game. Leonard misses a three. On the other end, Cousins makes a layup. The crowd gets loud but Lowry quickly quiets them with a quick score. We reach our first timeout of the game. That was an\u2026 interesting start. Raptors 3-4 Warriors, 8:30, 1st quarter Siakam gets fouled by Cousins, which puts him on the line. He makes one of two free throws for the Raptors\u2019 first point. Thompson scores on one end, Leonard on the other. Okay now we\u2019re starting to cook here. Raptors 0-2 Warriors, 9:19, 1st quarter Warriors get a bunch of chances to score here and don\u2019t manage to do it. This is getting comical here. Siakam misses on Toronto\u2019s end. DeMarcus Cousins loses the grip on the ball, turns it over. Raptors again get a chance for the first score and THEY turn it over. Finally, Curry gets a jumper to go for the first score of the game. Raptors 0-0 Warriors, 10:43, 1st quarter Raptors don\u2019t score in their first possession. The Warriors turn it over on theirs. The Raptors turn it over\u2026 the Warriors turn it over. Green misses a three. Both teams are a little ragged to start things out here. Raptors 0-0 Warriors, 12:00, 1st quarter And we\u2019re off! \u201cThis could be the last game in Oracle Arena\u201d is the theme of the broadcast it seems. We\u2019re heading towards Opening Tip here after the post-pregame pregame finishes. Paul Pierce thinks the Raptors are winning today and tomorrow. Jalen Rose agrees with me that the Warriors win in double-digits tonight. I feel better about my prediction. A band called Walk Off The Earth play a weird folked-up version of \u201cO Canada.\u201d I, uh, appreciate the ingenuity but am not sure about the execution. Meanwhile, the \u201cStar Spangled Banner\u201d is performed by (rolls dice) Ne-Yo. Sure, why not. Golden State Warriors starters Steph Curry, G Klay Thompson, G Andre Iguodala, F Draymond Green, F DeMarcus Cousins, C NBA Commissioner Adam Silver joins \u201cNBA Countdown\u201d to talk about Mark Stevens\u2019s punishment: a 1 year ban and a $500,000 fine. Jalen Rose grills him on the size of the fine, which really does feel a bit like a slap on the wrist. Overall, the NBA seems to be handling this rather well, at least compared to say how you\u2019d expect the likes of a Roger Goodell to bungle it. Toronto Raptors starters Nothing shocking here. Kyle Lowry, G Danny Green, G Kawhi Leonard, F Pascal Siakam, F Marc Gasol, C Warriors fans and Raptors fans both going \u201cnot it, not it, not it,\u201d right now. Predictions So it\u2019s time for a prediction for tonight\u2019s game. Well, since I got my predictions right for Games 1 &amp; 2, I\u2019m feeling pretty cocky here. I\u2019m going to say that there\u2019s no way that the Warriors don\u2019t even it up tonight 2-2. Steph Curry remains red hot but this time around he will have help. Thompson will be back and the supporting cast will rebound from their rough Game 3. I say they win and win rather easily. Let\u2019s say a final score of about like 120-107. Agree? Disagree? Feel free to send your predictions here either through email (hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or Twitter (@HunterFelt). One person who will not be at Oracle Arena is Golden State Warriors part-owner Mark Stevens, who has been banned from the rest of the finals after his confrontation with the Raptors\u2019 Kyle Lowry in Game 3. His behavior, which included directly cursing out Lowry, has led to universal condemnation around the NBA. Lowry seemed to speak for players in general with his comments about Stevens: \u201cThere\u2019s no place for that. He had no reason to touch me. He had no reason to reach over two seats and then say some vulgar language to me. There\u2019s no place for people like that in our league.\u201d In one respect, the Toronto Raptors have only done what they absolutely had to do to have a realistic shot of winning the NBA Finals. In a stretch of games where the Golden State Warriors have been without Kevin Durant, their best player, the Raptors won an emotional Game 1 at home and then took advantage of the additional absences of Klay Thompson and Kevon Looney in Game 3. With that, the Raptors struck their opponents when they\u2019ve been at their weakest and now lead the series 2-1. To say this is not to deny the Raptors their due credit. Heck, they even had their chances in Game 2 where they had a genuine chance to tie the game in the final minute. In an alternate universe, they have a 3-0 lead in the Finals right now. They\u2019ve done all of this without even a hero game from Kawhi Leonard yet. Now it\u2019s the Warriors who have a must-win before them as they can\u2019t afford to fall to 3-1. Golden State is too banged up and the Raptors are too formidable of an opponent for them to just assume that they can pull off three straight wins, two of them on the road. The good news for the Warriors is that the reinforcements are coming. While Durant is still out, Thompson and (somehow) Kevon Looney, playing with a broken collarbone, will be returning for tonight\u2019s Game 4. While it\u2019s a shame that injuries have played a factor here, it can\u2019t be denied that this has become a quite interesting Finals to this point. In fact, it\u2019s difficult to predict where we\u2019re headed from here, which feels rather unusual considering the usual air of inevitability that accompanies the Warriors. Could Game 4 be the point where this series finally comes into focus? Let\u2019s find out together, shall we? As always, you can contribute to this blog by either sending us email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or tweets (to @HunterFelt). Opening tip is set sometime around 9:00pm EST, but we\u2019ll be back before then to document the leadup to Game 4 of the NBA Finals between the Toronto Raptors and the Golden State Warriors at Oracle Arena. Hunter will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s Oliver Connolly\u2019s look back at Game 3."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
