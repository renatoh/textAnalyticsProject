By the time darkness fell the temperature remained stubbornly close to freezing but two more goals from Steve Bruce\u2019s defenders had warmed Newcastle fans, lifting their team to 11th. \u201cI\u2019m delighted with the spirit and attitude,\u201d said a beaming Bruce, who seems to have weathered the toughest of inductions to Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s old job. \u201cWe deserved to win.\u201d A fabulously entertaining game was punctuated by uplifting cameos from wingers, most notably Newcastle\u2019s Allan Saint-Maximin, although Harry Wilson did his bit too. Wilson has impressed enormously since joining Bournemouth on a season-long loan from Liverpool and the 22-year-old registered his fourth goal in 11 appearances. It came from a corner, swiftly taken by Ryan Fraser who exchanged perfectly weighted passes with Joshua King before playing in Wilson, who had cleverly manoeuvred himself into space. Completely unmarked, he curled a low, left-foot shot from 12 yards beyond Martin Dubravka as Eddie Howe and his staff celebrated a successful set-piece routine, evidently choreographed on a Hampshire training ground. The bad news for Bruce was that, not content with being the Premier League\u2019s dead-ball specialists, Bournemouth looked pretty dangerous from open play too. Callum Wilson\u2019s powers of acceleration repeatedly caught Newcastle\u2019s defence cold, while the dangerous Fraser\u2019s fabulous dipping shot skimmed Dubravka\u2019s bar. Newcastle were wobbling but, holding his nerve, their manager urged his wing-backs to press higher up the pitch and, almost imperceptibly, Adam Smith became increasingly fazed by Jetro Willems\u2019 left-sided incursions. Howe started to look wary of the hosts\u2019 often devastating change of counterattacking pace and after Steve Cook misread Joelinton\u2019s flick, Saint-Maximin pounced to lash a shot against the bar. Undeterred, the Frenchman promptly proceeded to, albeit inadvertently, create DeAndre Yedlin\u2019s equaliser when his deflected shot was headed home by the rapidly onrushing right wing-back. Bournemouth argued Yedlin was offside but a VAR review disagreed and the first goal Howe\u2019s team had conceded in four Premier League games stood. Once again Bruce\u2019s backline were showing up Joelinton and friends in the hard-working yet strangely shot-shy striking department. Indeed when, early in the second half, Ciaran Clark\u2019s scuffed shot eluded Aaron Ramsdale\u2019s reach it was the seventh League goal in nine games scored by a member of Newcastle\u2019s defence. Moreover Clark\u2019s winner was created by two rearguard colleagues, with Federico Fern\u00e1ndez heading Willems\u2019 ball into his path. Fern\u00e1ndez has only recently been recalled to the first XI but not for the first time the Argentinian centre-half excelled, repeatedly thwarting Bournemouth with intelligent interceptions. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201d said Howe who cursed as King headed Fraser\u2019s stoppage-time corner inches wide. \u201cWe\u2019re hugely frustrated.\u201d His gameplan had been spoilt by Saint-Maximin\u2019s idiosyncratic ability to both bewitch and bewilder. The much-adored former Nice winger almost scored his side\u2019s third after haring on to Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s through-ball but then accidentally prevented Miguel Almir\u00f3n registering a first Newcastle goal from the fallout when Almir\u00f3n\u2019s shot deflected comedically off his leg as he lay prone on the ground. \u201cAllan gets you on the edge of your seat,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cYou can\u2019t coach some of the stuff he does.\u201d Having begun confounding those who suspected he was incapable of filling Ben\u00edtez\u2019s shoes, it was small wonder he wore the contented expression of a man feeling the sun on his back for the first time after a long, hard winter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
