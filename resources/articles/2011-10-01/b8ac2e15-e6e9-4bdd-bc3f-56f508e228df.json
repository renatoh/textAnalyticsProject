Susie Nicklin, director of literature at the British Council, said the organisation's commemorations, involving events in more than 50 countries as part of the Dickens 2012 celebrations, would amount to a big, engaging, project. She said: \"The really exciting thing about it is the way that pretty much everyone within the British Council has got enthused by the ideas. \"We have colleagues who work in areas such as education and governance, and everyone is excited to have all the different strands brought together in one project. \"Live literature is such an exciting thing in the UK at the moment, whether it is in salons or festivals or salons, and one thing people will see is the way we engage with live literature and enjoy it. \"People will also see how we take quite seriously the linking of social justice themes \u2013 which Dickens was so passionate about \u2013 with contemporary events.\" Nicklin said she hoped the Dickens events would spur people to read and enjoy more contemporary literature as well as see Britain in a new way. The British Council programme, marking the bicentenary of Dickens' birth, which falls on 7 February 2012, will include film, performance, talks and debates in countries from Azerbaijan to Zimbabwe. Among the confirmed events are a debate in January, in Berlin, featuring the writers Claire Tomalin, Toby Litt, Louise Doughty, Philip Hensher, Denise Mina and David Nicholls. The latter has adapted Great Expectations for a film, directed by Mike Newell, which begins shooting next week, starring Helena Bonham Carter as Miss Havisham and Ralph Fiennes as Magwitch. This panel will discuss the question: \"What would Dickens write today?\" In February the theatre company Punchdrunk, in a collaboration with east London's Arcola theatre, will go to Lahore and Karachi to perform The Uncommercial Traveller, a work based on some of Dickens' less well-known journalism. In China, the British Council has launched a creative writing project called Sketches with Boz through QQ, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter; the call for aspiring writers for the project will go across the world. Film will also be a key part of the programme and there are plans for 12 films to be screened in 20 countries, including David Lean's Oliver Twist and Great Expectations. Florian Schweizer, who is both director of Dickens 2012, and of the Charles Dickens Museum, in Doughty Street, London, said: \"Charles Dickens deserves to be commemorated as one of the greatest storytellers, entertainers and philanthropists in history, and that is precisely what we will do in 2012. \"The programme put together by Dickens 2012 in the UK and by the British Council around the world reflects the vast cultural impact and relevance of the man and his works.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
