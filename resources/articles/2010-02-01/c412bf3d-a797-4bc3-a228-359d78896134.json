It was announced this week that Leyshon had been commissioned by Shakespeare's Globe to write a drama for the theatre \u2013 the first woman to be asked since its opening in 1599. But Leyshon has something else on her mind first: body image. She's working on play about the subject for the National Theatre, which has joined her with a group of teenagers in Plymouth. As we speak, she's scurrying through an industrial park, attempting to find the rehearsal space. \"I come down for a week and write a play,\" she says brightly. \"It is a bit terrifying, because I've sworn I'll finish it by Friday. The kids don't quite believe me. But I will \u2013 because there's other things I have to do.\" There is the small matter of finishing that historic commission. The play she's writing for the Globe is entitled Bedlam, an 18th-century costume drama set in a fictionalised version of the notorious lunatic asylum. It will be a freewheeling mix of love and insanity; a romance infused with tragedy that will no doubt use the Globe's unique properties \u2013 that large, open-air auditorium, Shakespeare's circular \"wooden O\" \u2013 to full-throated effect. A fitting debut for a theatre with a rambunctious reputation. \"I thought I wasn't ready to write a big story for a big space,\" Leyshon says. \"Playwrights now often write very small, very intense plays. You don't get the opportunity to really stretch yourself, to be really brave. The Globe is much more extravagant to write for, much more extrovert. You have to embrace the nature of the space, and the nature of the audience.\" And there's all that history, too. When the original Globe burned down in 1613, it was illegal for women to appear on stage, never mind write plays. Western theatre hasn't moved on as much as it should, believes Leyshon. \"When I started writing for theatre, people would say, 'She's a woman writer,' and I didn't understand that. You'd never say, 'She's a woman novelist' or, 'She's a woman journalist.' But in theatre, you do.\" One reason could be that it's much tougher for women to find work in professional theatre. Only 23% of directors are female, according to campaigning theatre company Sphinx. And fewer than a fifth of playwrights getting work staged are women. Money plays a part, Leyshon suggests, as do the practicalities of finding creative energy. \"Writing a play, you have to retain it all in your head \u2013 you need more time. With prose, you can snatch an hour here, an hour there.\" Leyshon, 48, has experience at juggling. After growing up in Somerset and completing an art foundation course, she moved to London to work in a film-editing company (\"the men started as runners, the women as receptionists\"), then rapidly made her way up. By 24, she was producing big-budget TV commercials, but felt unfulfilled. So she quit to study English at Southampton University \u2013 then found out she was pregnant. \"I thought: perfect,\" she giggles. \"But going to university with a baby teaches you huge discipline. Lots of women who work understand that. If you lose three hours because you're chatting with people over coffee, that's three hours of paid childcare. You have to use the time you have.\" Leyshon began writing at university; short stories, then novels. After she graduated, she took on teaching to pay the bills and had another son. But she kept writing. \"I think women often have problems with self-belief, which sounds a bit boring, but they do \u2013 and I think when women are bringing up children, it can be chronic, because you have all these other calls on your time. There were many days when I thought it would be easier not to write.\" There were times she came close: in 2000, she built a bonfire in her garden and burned all her early work. But she freed herself from creative despair by writing a radio play, and finding that she loved it: \"The feeling was electric.\" She decided to try her hand at writing for theatre. She didn't finish her first play until she was 40, but things have happened quickly since. Her second, Comfort Me With Apples, debuted at Hampstead in 2005, and she won the Evening Standard award for most promising playwright. A novel, Black Dirt, was longlisted for the Orange prize; her adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's psychologically charged Don't Look Now opened in Sheffield in 2007, and transferred to the Lyric Hammersmith in London. Impressive achievements in a theatre world that, more than ever, seems obsessed by youth. \"I think there is too much focus on young writers,\" Leyshon agrees. \"And that's to their detriment, too. There are advantages in being young, having that freedom, but I'm really glad I waited until now to write plays, because I have so much to write about \u2013 too much. Seeing people on their third marriages, people who've lost children, all these things, gives you much more of an insight into the human condition.\" Leyshon recalls hearing Rebecca Lenkiewicz, the first woman to write a play for the National's Olivier stage, giving a radio interview. \"I had this great feeling of, 'Oh, that's done now.' If you do it, then other people do it, and it's not such a big thing.\" She laughs. \"It's something that had to be done. It's like losing your virginity.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
