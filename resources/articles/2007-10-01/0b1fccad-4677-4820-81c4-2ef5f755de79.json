Even a band with a sense of humour as macabre as the Soho sextet could not hope to recreate that onstage. Nevertheless, their instrumentation provides plenty to discuss. The group employ a large plastic butterfly that makes cat noises and a device like an enormous breathalyser, which the drummer blows into. Most triumphantly, cocktail-dressed harmonist Becky Jacobs produces a wind-up caged bird that tweets in time. The comical instruments are not gimmicks but components of Tunng's \"folktronica\". The unwieldy tag accurately describes their mix of guitars, harmonies, sound effects and electronic glitches - like Simon and Garfunkel sharing a stage with Aphex Twin. With hair and beards, they visually fit the bill of a typical folk outfit. When Mike Lindsay, who looks like Young Ones' hippy Neil, waves his arms like Ian Curtis and says, \"We're just like Joy Division really\", he could not be further from the truth, but it does hint at the songs' undercurrent of darkness. Tunng songs tell us we will be very miserable, lose our friends and die, but they sound cheery about the prospect. The mesmerising Jenny Again is perhaps the first murder ballad set inside a Little Chef. They sometimes seem formulaic, as if children's chants or LFO-type sub-bass have been bolted on to straightforward songs. However, everything comes together on Bullets, as band and audience sing a celebratory song about the futility of existence. The message hits home to the bird, who falls silent and tumbles off his perch. \u00b7 At 229, London, tonight.
