I was attending the Royal Television Society awards in London when I was asked to take a phone call in the manager's office. There I was told that my brother Kevin had died near his home in Cardiff. He had gone out for an early evening run and apparently tripped and fell, suffering a fractured skull which killed him almost immediately. An already tragic situation was compounded by the fact that the incident had taken place almost 36 hours earlier but because Kevin was dressed to run he was carrying no means of identification and so the police had no idea who he was. Despite being just a few hundred yards from his home there was no way for anyone to know anything about him and because his partner was away he was not missed until the following day. Finally after media appeals by the police and some frantic searching from his partner the awful truth was passed on to me the following evening. Like most of us Kevin donned a T-shirt and shorts on a warm day and set out from the front door focused only on enjoying his run and not for one second thinking anything untoward would happen. So no phone, no wallet and no way of being identified. Unfortunately over the past few years I have been made aware of the fact that, although Kevin's accident was thankfully a rare event, there are many situations which arise whereby friends and family have not been able to be contacted when an incident has taken place because the person involved has no visible means of identification. At a time when we are all being encouraged to get out and about more, to exercise and to persuade our kids to get on their bikes, I have always been keen to come up with an identification system that would make such activities stress-free for those who might be worried about mishaps or accidents. This week we launched a service which aims to do exactly that. Families or individuals can register their details including next of kin and any relevant medical information with an incident response centre. In return they receive a wristband which includes their own personal ID number and the response centre number to call if anyone finds that particular individual in any difficulty. The emergency services may also be contacted depending on the situation and any relevant information passed on to them. Crucially, family and friends can be notified immediately. It may be as simple as someone falling off a bike and being taken to hospital, or perhaps an elderly person wandering off and getting confused. The applications are numerous and if, like me, you give little care to where you are going and what you're doing, it might just offer a little peace of mind to those waiting at home wondering what's happened to you this time. In an age where we are also loth to carry too much paraphernalia around it decreases the need to have a phone in your pocket just in case. I'm certainly not a fan of those who would have us believethere are dangers round every corner but, on the other hand, I don't mind a hassle-free approach to safety and security. Even I would be prepared to wear a wristband with a number on it without complaining. This is not a piece of stunning technology and it's not even as sexy as a new crash helmet for your mountain bike but it is simple, practical and has many relevant applications. There are other similar services out there such as Medi-Bracelet but CramAlert, as we have called it, is a more straightforward ID system particularly aimed at those who do not consider themselves to be in any sort of danger, medical or otherwise. Thankfully Kevin's story is not the norm but accidents do happen. As I put the phone down that night my grief was gradually displaced by irrational anger at the authorities for not notifying us earlier. The fact is there was little they could have done. The wristband would not have saved his life but it would have made a horribly painful situation a little more bearable for the family.
