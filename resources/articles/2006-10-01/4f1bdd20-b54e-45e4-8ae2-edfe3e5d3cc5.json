You have 10 guesses. And you should feel exceedingly pleased with yourself if any of those 10 guesses is Sweden. The next-best countries are less surprising. In order, they are France, Holland, Spain, Germany, Portugal, England and the Czech Republic. In ninth place, however, just above Italy, are Romania. The presence of Sweden and Romania neatly illustrates the point that the countries sometimes underestimated in betting markets - just as they are in public perceptions - are those from northern and eastern Europe. Immediately below the top 10 are Croatia - England's opponents next Wednesday - Serbia and Denmark. It is not that northern and eastern nations are superior to southern and western ones. It is just that, in particular instances, they are not as inferior as is sometimes imagined. It is, of course, precisely those sort of countries that we are always looking for when betting. Sweden's position is probably slightly misleading. Only once in the previous five campaigns were they pitched in with one of the supposedly elite football nations, though on that occasion they did finish above England. The Romanians have not qualified for any of the last three major tournaments, but each time they only narrowly failed to emerge from an exceptionally difficult group. In truth, it is much harder to assess international football than club football, for the simple reason that there is much less of it. In the last 10 calendar years, England have played 60 competitive games, only slightly more than a successful English club might complete in a single season. By examining results over a number of years, however, it is possible to get an idea of a country's usual place in the international pecking order. Sweden, unfortunately, could be seriously under-strength for tomorrow's game at home to Spain. It would have been an interesting betting contest otherwise. But it is possible that, next Wednesday, bookmakers may contentiously declare England more likely than Croatia to win in Zagreb.
