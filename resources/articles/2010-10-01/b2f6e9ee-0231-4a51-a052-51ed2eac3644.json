Yet, by the time the earth began to yield them up again yesterday, one by one, in a sort of multiple rebirth whose joy never diminished however often the rescue process was repeated, the whole world was watching. No one, never mind a group of 33, has ever been trapped underground for as long as these indomitable miners. But it was not just the record-breaking length of their entombment, or the spectacular depth of the gallery in which they were trapped by the rock fall 10 weeks ago, that seemed to hold the common attention as the story reached its climax yesterday. It was the courage of the trapped miners themselves. It was the commitment of the rescuers. It was the sleepless solidarity of the families. It was, in short, the wonderful collective display of the human spirit. Everybody who was involved in the epic events in Chile's northern desert yesterday rose to the occasion \u2013 in the case of the rescued miners themselves, quite literally so as each was winched 2,000ft to the surface in the Fenix rescue capsule. The American drillers, who had been relocated from Afghanistan, sank the rescue shaft with extraordinary skill. The Chilean engineers who designed the rescue pod that brought each man up from the depths got all the technical questions right. The rescue teams seemed to have thought everything through impressively, from getting the best German cable to winch the Fenix up the narrow shaft to ensuring that the trapped miners received some basic media training for the spotlight that awaited them. The politicians, from Chile's billionaire conservative president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, to the Atacama region's socialist senator, Isabel Allende, daughter of Chile's greatest modern leftwing martyr, worked tirelessly. Above all, the miners \u2013 young and old, healthy and sick, strong and weak \u2013 all pulled together, kept one another's spirits up, worked as a team, all for one and one for all, in ways that to the watchers on the spot and far away were at times simply overwhelming in their nobility. The word that the prime minister used to describe it all in the House of Commons yesterday was \"glorious\" \u2013 an inspired choice. As the rescue comes to a close, harder questions will become more prominent. How to protect the rescued men from the anticlimax of the return to ordinary life? How to ensure that they can cope with the ending of the old pressures and the arrival of a set of new ones? There will be arguments, too, about Chilean mining, about the human cost of the demand for metals that generate 40% of Chile's national income and even more of those of some of its neighbours (where working conditions are far worse than in Chile), and about China's appetite for minerals, which led the San Jos\u00e9 to be reopened unsafely. If nothing else, the events in Atacama may also help to concentrate more sustained attention on South America (its economy is double the size of India's) in this country. Stepping back from the drama and emotions of the past 70 days, it is a truism that the rescue is also another reminder of the instant interconnection of the 21st-century world. But it is a reminder with a difference. We are used to being united by things going wrong \u2013 by climate change and pollution, economic collapse and uncertainty, the imminence of terrorism, the defenceless danger of epidemic. We are used, too, in the global-media-dominated world, to shared entertainment such as the Oscars or the World Cup. Much has been written, too, about how atomised and individualistic the modern world has become, everyone doing their own thing, bowling alone. It has become rather unusual, by contrast, to be united by genuine shared happiness. But that is what has happened here. These 24 hours have been a reminder, and not just for the Chilean miners, that it is good to be human, and even better to be alive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
