As the only non-Bulgarian lawyer present for evidence sessions at last year's trial of Liverpool football fan Michael Shields, I was struck at the ease with which shaky identification evidence produced by a badly bungled police investigation was allowed to be \"massaged\" by witness box identification: it was a triumph of showmanship over written statement. The first instance of this I recall was that the defendant had requested a haircut before court and the prison governor had written a letter to state that it was his opinion that the haircut request was for the purpose of avoiding recognition in the witness box. The defence objected, the objection was overruled and the letter solemnly admitted in evidence. One flawed trial does not indict a system but on my return I was informed by the Bulgarian ambassador to the UK that prosecutors were considered part of the judiciary in Bulgaria. It appears we are still faced with an unreconstructed, state-biased and fundamentally flawed criminal justice system in Bulgaria.
