Who is, it turns out, Tim Bresnan, a player I was confidently expecting to feel disappointed by, before moving on to championing his immediate replacement in the England team by some hair-gelled academy dreamboat. There is a process to how we choose who to root for in sport. Often it's bound up with an early glimpse of something exceptional, a brief chimera of promise that stays with us, grimly cherished against mounting evidence of Aussie-flunking, technique-yippery, brain-rot, hair-recession, average-decline, illegal Twenty20 piratism, surly encounters in car parks and even, in extreme cases, retirement to teach geography. With Bresnan the process has worked in reverse. He appeared ordinary to begin with. As a fixture in the team, he still seems ordinary. And not in a larger-than-life kind of way. This is very much a same-size-as-life ordinariness. But still I find myself rooting for him, wincing at his near-misses, and noting grimly the buffetings and bolstering of his twin averages. I suspect I'm not alone. It's not so much that Bresnan is a thrilling cricketer, although it is absorbing watching him gallop in to bowl, squinting, muttering, burping, and looking like a man in furious pursuit of the last night bus home through a semi-pedestrianised provincial town centre. You expect to look down and notice he's holding a pasty. He is simply a familiar and likably boisterous presence, someone you feel sure you might have once been mildly terrorised by on a stag do in a European capital via the use of inappropriately violent practical jokes that involve doing something horrible to someone's shoes. There is also something comforting in Bresnan's cricket. This England team is a sleek machine. It can be hard to get a handle on. Bowlers in particular are treated like bolt-on bits of hardware. Currently there is talk of the need for \"an enforcer\", some bounce-merchant and tail-destroyer. Stuart Broad has been despatched to sweat and grunt in a centrally-funded gym facility (but hopefully not to the same degree as Chris Tremlett who, at Surrey, has become mind-bogglingly beefcaked and now resembles a flesh coloured wetsuit stuffed with gammon hocks and tree stumps and slabs of bison). Out of this Bresnan emerges as agreeably unstyled. It is tempting to call him a throwback, but this usually means looking back at something that was fine or noble. This is the exciting paradox of Bresnan: a skilful performer in his odd-jobbing all-rounder role; but one who is still able to evoke, purely through his Scotch egg-infused presence, a time when England's cricketers were largely sulky and double-chinned and mediocre. Until recently the England team was full of players who both looked and played like this. It is this indigenous, unchiselled type who suddenly seems a rarity. In Bresnan we have a happy hybrid, Fat Lad 2.0: a confident and efficient and entirely new-era cross-format crick-machine. But one who also wouldn't look out of place eating a cheese and onion roll in a Harvester in 1986. Let him always be there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
