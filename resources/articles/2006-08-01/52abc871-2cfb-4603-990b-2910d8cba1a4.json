But Colchester United have not been afforded the luxury of the former. Stripped of a pair of crucial players - Liam Chilvers and Neil Danns - not to mention their manager Phil Parkinson, last season's League One runners-up have been left to adjust to the rigours of the Championship without reinforcement. Thus far they have found the going tough: this was their fourth defeat out of four. Yet few losses could offer such solace. West Bromwich's near-immaculate first-half performance that brought goals for Nathan Ellington and Ronnie Wallwork was nearly matched by the visitors in the second. There were noticeable rumblings of discontent from the stands, such was Colchester's dominance. \"We caused problems all second half but we gave ourselves a mountain to climb,\" said Geraint Williams, Parkinson's replacement at Layer Road. \"People were wondering if we could compete in this league. Well we certainly can compete - nobody has had an easy game against us.\" Williams, though, must be concerned that the momentum of last season has evaporated so soon. Defeats at the Hawthorns and St Andrew's should not be considered too ominous, though defeats at home to Plymouth and Barnsley certainly should. Nevertheless their second-half display here, one of crisp passing and flowing movement, capped by Jamie Guy's volley, is reason for optimism. \"If you actually look at the teams we've come to - Birmingham and West Brom - we haven't been played off the pitch,\" said Guy, who as Albion battled Premiership relegation last season was scoring goals for Staines. \"Obviously people are disappointed, but they are confident of their ability. No one is doubting we that can get the points, but we've got to start picking them up sooner rather than later otherwise it is going to be too late and teams are going to start pulling away.\" Albion, meanwhile, remain undefeated if not untested. If they can maintain the standards of Saturday's first 45 minutes, when the midfield was slick and efficient, and Ellington and John Hartson were the source for several chances, then few teams will get close to Albion this season. Slipping into the slovenliness of the second will see the Baggies adrift and frustrated. It is a fact not lost on their manager Bryan Robson. \"We've got to improve our second-half performances if we want to do well this season,\" he said. \"Our concentration was nowhere near as good and we gave the ball away too easily. And if you keep giving the ball back they are going to put more pressure on you.\" The pressure on Colchester is increasing already.
