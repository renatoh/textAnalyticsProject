First, his eldest, Jean, 18, falls for a married man, an East Ender, who has been taking \u201cglamour\u201d pictures of her. And if that weren\u2019t enough, his younger daughter, Chrissie, is knocking around with a student, whose only prospect of gainful employment seems to be with a music group who are yet to release a record. Faced with the prospect of David Bailey in his hay barn and Mick Jagger in his back bedroom, it seems that Edward Shrimpton could not decide who to aim his shotgun at first. Sixty years on, Jean Shrimpton and Bailey can still conjure the thrill of those early liaisons, in which at least one free-spirited image of the decade that followed was created. They never did an interview together in the years that they made each other famous, as far as they recall, so when they sit down here, at the heart of Bailey\u2019s predictably candid memoir, it\u2019s like they are piecing together little fragments of a shared fantasy: the landmark Vogue shoot in New York, taking studio fashion on to the street, him bringing flowers to her, and carrying them without embarrassment, their first sex, on Littleton Common (\u201cah yes, I remember it well\u201d). \u201cIt took me three months to get my leg across,\u201d Bailey recalls, to emphasise his gallantry. There is much that you might feel you know already in this book, but what lifts it above the familiar are the recorded segments in which we hear Bailey test his memory against some of the people he has been closest to \u2013 not only Shrimpton, but also his ex-wives, Catherine Deneuve and Marie Helvin, current wife, Catherine Dyer, and many more friends and lovers. In this way James Fox, Bailey\u2019s ghostwriter, makes what could be an exercise in self-mythology something far more raw and surprising (in this sense, the book makes a worthy successor to Fox\u2019s last efforts as a \u201cghost\u201d for Keith Richards\u2019s Life). At times he gives full rein to Bailey\u2019s unreconstructed cockney persona, but eavesdropping on him in the company of old friends and old lovers, we also hear him confront and examine some more complex drivers of his priapic creativity. A lot of this goes back to the photographer\u2019s childhood. Fox probes and presses him about his relationship with his parents, his angry mother, and his wayward father \u2013 he was the accident that enforced their horribly unhappy marriage \u2013 and lets that wartime rationing of affection explain some of Bailey\u2019s legendary restlessness. Bailey dates his eye for female beauty back to the afternoon in 1948 when he went with his mother and his aunt on their annual trip to the West End, and to Selfridges to try on the dresses they could never afford, before they returned home to run up versions of them on their sewing machines. On one such occasion his mother tried on a Dior-style dress and twirled in front of the department store window, backlit \u2013 and nine-year-old Bailey took his first photograph in his head. He held on to that image, it seems, even as he was being called stupid every day at school (he left at 14 and was diagnosed with dyslexia aged 30) and through jobs that included a spell as a debt collector in the East End in his teens. He was, according to his oldest friend, Danny O\u2019Connor, never without \u201cthe Bailey stare\u201d apparently seeing things in people \u2013 women \u2013 that they hardly saw themselves. The stare got him into lots of trouble, taking beatings from local thugs, \u201cthe Barking boys\u201d, whose girlfriends he eyed up, but it was also his almost unfailing attraction. He never doubted that gift. \u201cMy mother used to say, \u2018You\u2019ll end up like all of us, driving the 101 bus,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cI thought, \u2018I fucking won\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Much of this story, and much of the behaviour it describes, reads like a foreign country in our more censorious times. As Bailey\u2019s longtime assistant John Swannell puts it: \u201cWhatever trip he was on, he went for the model and 99% of the time he was bonking them.\u201d There is, from the many former lovers who appear in these pages, no suggestion that any of that attention was unwanted. Fox\u2019s subtle telling lets you see how this looked through Bailey\u2019s eyes, and occasionally allows you to see the edges of that viewfinder. \u2022 Look Again by David Bailey is published by Macmillan (\u00a320).
