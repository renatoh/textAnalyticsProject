Unfortunately for Leicester, not only did Micky Adams get his changes wrong here but Nikos Dabizas miscalculated some key challenges. Leading 3-1 in the 90th minute, Adams's side ended up drawing. He will surely rue three late switches presumably intended as time-wasters. Firstly, in the 83rd minute, Paul Dickov and Marcus Bent were replaced. Dickov scored twice and held the ball up adroitly; Bent claimed Leicester's third and performed similarly important holding work. Then, seconds after Dabizas had deflected a shot from Massimo Maccarone beyond Ian Walker to make it 3-2, Billy McKinlay, Adams's enforcer, made way for the flighty Keith Gillespie. Suddenly incapable of keeping the ball, the Foxes' folly was complete when John Curtis turned Gaizka Mendieta's cross into his own net. The irony that Maccarone and Mendieta had themselves stepped off the bench serves to highlight just how tricky this substitution business can be. \"Maybe when we got to 3-1 we panicked,\" suggested Dickov, who has scored 11 times this season. \"We've dropped so many points by conceding late goals. \"Everyone is devastated. The only good thing is that we are scoring and creating, which people said we wouldn't be able to do in this league.\" The principal creator was Steve Guppy, back from Celtic. Leicester's game revolves around well-choreographed set pieces and Guppy's left foot imbues those with added men ace, his corner prompting Dickov's first goal and his free-kick prefacing the second. They negated Juninho's early goal when the Brazilian collected a clearance from Walker that rebounded off Joseph- Desir\u00e9 Job, and dodged Dabizas to side-foot home. Walker then saved Job's penalty after Dabizas felled the striker and Leicester rallied. Bent shot the third when Andrew Davies's awkward backpass betrayed Mark Schwarzer. Davies was part of a home defence lacking the injured Gareth Southgate and Ugo Ehiogu. If both are still absent on Tuesday, when Middles brough visit Arsenal in the League Cup, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's reserves may scent victory. It would, however, be misguided to blame Saturday's wobble on a debilitated defence; indeed many Boro fans insist undue caution was the cause. Why did Steve McClaren start with a lone striker and why did his midfielders ration their forward runs so strictly? The fact that a Middlesbrough team boasting Juninho, Mendieta and Maccarone frequently struggles to score freely might just be more about tactics than talent.
