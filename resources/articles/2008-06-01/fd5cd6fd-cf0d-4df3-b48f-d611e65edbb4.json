In 1991, Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary in the Conservative government led by John Major, floated the idea but fearing strong local leaders in their areas, Tory MPs resisted. In 1997 Tony Blair gave the plan a boost. Always veering towards a presidential style in his own leadership, he saw mayors giving localities a clear sense of direction; they would unify the management and delivery of local services and provide high profile, outgoing local leadership. This time the idea had momentum, despite a distinct lack of enthusiasm in local government circles, and led to two important acts of parliament. First, the Greater London Authority Act of 1999 created an entirely new form of metropolitan government for a world city of seven million people. Introducing a strategic metropolitan authority headed by a directly elected mayor was, when compared with the hopelessly fragmented systems of city government found in most major cities across the world, a startling breakthrough in institutional reform. And it captured the public imagination. The recent contest for the position of mayor of London stimulated unprecedented interest in a UK local government election. By comparison, the Local Government Act 2000 has been disappointing. Yes, it got the mayor idea onto the English catwalk \u2013 all local authorities (except those with a population of less than 85,000) were required to modify their political management structures and to at least consider introducing a directly elected mayor. The trouble is only 3% opted for the mayor/cabinet model. Ministers are now contemplating a third run at the local leadership agenda and a white paper from the communities secretary, Hazel Blears, expected in July, could make radical proposals. A paper from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), Mayors Rule, is well timed. Michael Kenny and Guy Lodge provide a review of the experience with mayors in England and sketch ways of expanding their number. They focus their attention on unitary councils and metropolitan district councils (82 in total). Their first option would require them to hold a mayoral referendum to be held on the same day everywhere. This would galvanise public interest and lead to a full airing of the case for and against this post. Their second option says ministers should bring forward legislation introducing elected mayors in all urban authorities. For localists this may smack of the flawed Whitehall-knows-best approach. But both Italy and Germany have recently introduced the directly elected mayor model into their systems of local government through legislation. And the Greater London Authority Act was a top-down affair. There are two weaknesses in the IPPR analysis. First, the authors don't seem to grasp the fact that high-profile, successful directly elected mayors in other countries have financial powers UK council leaders can only dream about. And Ken Livingstone was effective in London not just because of his position \u2013 he had real powers to do things. A white paper proposing more elected mayors in England without a massive boost in financial power for local authorities will create figures who will not be able to deliver the spirited leadership local communities and businesses take for granted in cities like Chicago and New York. They will be featherweight mayors. Ministers should contemplate introducing significant financial incentives for those authorities that choose to adopt the directly elected mayor form. Second, and this is surprising given the growing recognition of the importance of city regions in driving economic and social progress in modern Europe, the IPPR paper is silent on the idea of metropolitan mayors on the London model. Surely the time has come to explore the introduction of metropolitan mayors in all major English cities. This would position the UK as a world leader in the reform of urban governance. Our cities would be better able to compete in the global economy and the democratic legitimacy of local political leaders would be enhanced. \u00b7 Robin Hambleton is professor of city leadership at the University of the West of England.
