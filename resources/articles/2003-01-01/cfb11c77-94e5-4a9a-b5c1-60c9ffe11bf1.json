The consortium is controlled by the engineering firms Jarvis and Bechtel, which are pressing ahead without the full membership of a third partner, Amey, which has delayed its \u00a360m investment because of financial difficulties. Tube Lines' chief executive, Terry Morgan, promised that passengers would see an im provement in services within a year, describing it as \"one of the most important days in the history of the Tube\". Mr Morgan said he felt relief that the deal had been signed: \"I've got people around me who have been trying to do this deal for four-and-a-half years. They just want to get on with it and deliver the improvements we're promising.\" Tube Lines has pledged that it will invest \u00a34.4bn in maintaining and upgrading the three lines over seven years - equivalent to \u00a31.6m a day. London Underground, which remains under public ownership, will keep responsibility for running trains and operating stations. Mr Morgan said priorities would be adding extra carriages to trains on the Jubilee line and introducing frequent \"deep cleans\" to brighten the environment. He admitted that winning plaudits from the public could prove challenging. The Tube Lines deal is the first stage of the government's public-private partnership on the Underground. A second deal, in which the rival Metronet consortium will take on a further nine lines, has been delayed until the spring. Critics have called the PPP dangerous and incomprehensible. Operational contracts include 300 different formulas for measuring performance, with a complex system of attribution to determine who is at fault for each delay. The mayor's transport commissioner, Bob Kiley, accused the government of attempting to \"hide bad news from the public\" by signing the deal over the holiday season - a decision which he described as \"secretive and irrational\". Mr Morgan blamed Mr Kiley and Mr Livingstone for pushing the deal to the end of the year through constant legal challenges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
