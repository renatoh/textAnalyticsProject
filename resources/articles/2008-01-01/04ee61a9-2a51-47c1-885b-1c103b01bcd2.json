Who will he appoint to the Regius Professorship of Modern History at the University of Cambridge? Stop looking blank. The appointment, which has been decided by prime ministers for centuries, should titillate Brown, himself a historian (he spent 15 years in Edinburgh University's history department, where he won a first-class degree and wrote his PhD on the early years of Scottish socialism). So who is in the running for one of British academia's plum jobs? Linda Colley (G2 odds: 3/1). Shelby MC Davis 1958 Professor of History at Princeton. Pluses: Her brilliant 1992 book Britons: Forging the Nation 1017-1837 has been used by Brown in speeches on Britishness. She would be the first woman in the post. Minus: Her December 1999 lecture, Britishness in the 21st Century, was one of a series of millennium lectures hosted by Tony and Cherie Blair. Richard Evans (G2 odds: 2/1 favourite). Professor of History at Cambridge, writing a multi-volume account of the Third Reich. Pluses: Baiter of Holocaust deniers. Brown likes to stress second world war experience in our national story. Minus: Cambridge insider, which may not appeal to Brown, a lifelong Oxbridge outsider. Christopher Andrew (G2 odds: 7/2). Professor of Modern and Contemporary History at Cambridge and specialist in the intelligence services. Pluses: Meticulous historian who has exposed many of the former Soviet Union's spying secrets. Minuses: Another Cambridge man. Controversial, as he has been charged with being too close to the spooks to write an objective account. Gareth Stedman Jones (G2 odds: 8/1). Professor of Political Science at Cambridge, currently writing a biography of Karl Marx. Pluses: The former \"new Left\" guru and pioneer social historian could appeal to lingering radical credentials the PM may harbour. Minuses: Another Cambridge man. And, anyway, surely Gordon thinks Marx is so over?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
