Wales defeated the makeweights of Macedonia in Cardiff with a second-half goal from Simon Church, and could even afford to waste a penalty, taken by Aaron Ramsey. They move ahead of Scotland in World Cup Group A but qualification has long been impossible. Conventional wisdom had it that the outcome of the last two group matches, here and in Belgium on Tuesday, would decide Coleman's fate but the man himself suspects his time is up and that the two-year contract he was offered recently is no longer on the table. \"I don't really want to talk about the contract. If I'd lost this game I'd have been out of the door, no doubt about it. There's a lot for me to look at. There's been a lot of criticism and I'm not complaining about that. That's how it works in football. I know what I can do if I've got all my players available but 15 pulled out of the squad this time, and I'm not sure what I can do without them. There's a lot of food for thought.\" The smart money is on Craig Bellamy, who is retiring from playing international football after the Belgium game, staying on as the new manager. Coleman's record would suggest he is lucky still to be in the job. Of his 13 matches Wales have won four and lost eight. In mitigation he has rarely had a full squad available, as last night's withdrawals exemplified. Severely depleted, the Welsh had a left-back playing at right-back, a right-back at centre-half, and only six from Premier League clubs in their line-up. Charlton's Church, their matchwinner, is from League One but it was ever thus and Coleman's predecessor, the late lamented Gary Speed, made a much better fist of dealing with the problem. Before his untimely demise in November 2011, Speed's team had won four of their last five, beating Montenegro, Norway and Switzerland at home and Bulgaria away. Small wonder the FA of Wales insists Coleman should be doing better and is wavering over a contract for their manager, whose present deal expires at the end of next month. The chief executive, Jonathan Ford, spoke of \"a desperately disappointing qualifying group\". The list of absentees this time read like a Who's Who of Welsh football, headed by the world's most expensive player, Gareth Bale, and including the captain, Ashley Williams. The Premier League's player of the month, Ramsey was given the captain's armband and played in a new role, in the hole behind Church. \"He ran the game, he was superb \u2013 on a different level to the rest,\" Coleman said. Wales were the better team and Bellamy's corner was met at the near post by Leicester's Andy King, whose close range volley was cleared off the line. The all-important first goal should have come after 31 minutes when Cardiff's Declan John, making his debut, supplied an inviting cross from the left, only for Church to head wastefully over the bar. On a chilly night, Bellamy warmed Tomislav Pacovski's hands from distance and the goalkeeper was further tested, overhead, by a shot from Church. Macedonia's best opening of the first 45 fell to Nikolce Noveski, the Mainz central defender, who finished like one. It had the look of a goalless draw, but midway through the second half a defence-splitting through-pass from Ramsey, inside the left-back, found Bellamy, whose centre from the right set up Church for a smart, driven finish. Macedonia would have equalised but for a vital save by Wayne Hennessey, keeping out Goran Pandev's shot from a central position, ten yards out. Wales had their penalty after 84 minutes when Ramsey, tripped in the area, failed with the consequent strike from the spot, which was too close to the Macedonia keeper, Tome Pacovski."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
