All it lacked was any details of what such an 'alliance' involves. In the short term, the leak of the deal, followed by irresponsible reporting the following morning - some 'experts' laughably talked of profits of billions - led to a seven per cent hike in United's share price. It dropped back by yesterday, but is still up on the week by more than four per cent at a time when football club shares are plummeting. The news leaked from an American wire service before an official announcement could be made. As the week progressed and interested parties digested the sparse information emerging from the respective camps in New York, the overwhelming reaction was one of confusion and, in some cases, anger. A statement, issued jointly by United and YankeeNets, the company that owns the Yankees, said the two parties would be 'sharing marketing information, developing sponsorship and cross promotional programs, and selling products from all franchises in individual team stores'. The Yankees will also aid United in planning 'youth and community relations initiatives in North America' as well as developing a tour in 2003. Even these sparse 'facts' throw up more questions than answers. Selling merchandise in team stores is a non-starter. United have signed a 13-year deal worth \u00a3303 million with Nike that starts next year. The Yankees have been with adidas since 1997 and are that company's most high-profile North American asset. Additionally, the terms of the Nike contract call for the American company to market United merchandise globally. Now, the Yankees are being put forward in this role. Nike, who were not aware of the deal until hours before its announcement, are said to be nervous and unhappy at the association between their prize asset and one 'belonging' to adidas. The concept that YankeeNets will assist United in implementing community and grass-roots initiatives in the States is laughable. Not only could neither party explain what this might entail - save for Sir Bobby Charlton offering help to the North American Football Association, a body that never has and never will exist - but the very notion outraged Major League Soccer, the domestic professional league. 'What do the Yankees know about soccer in the US?' said MLS executive vice president Mark Noonan. Television rights are collectively owned by the leagues in which the clubs play. So what is the deal about? An exchange of business expertise, and not much else. Is that really the basis for a significant rise in share value?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
