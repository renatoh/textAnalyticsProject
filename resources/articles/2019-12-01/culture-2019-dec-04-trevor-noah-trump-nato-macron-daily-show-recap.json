But as Trevor Noah noted on the Daily Show, Trump was out of town, heading to London for a major Nato summit, an occasion which exposed simmering tensions between the president and other world leaders. In an impromptu 40-minute press conference earlier this week, Trump blasted France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, for calling Nato \u201cbraindead\u201d in part because of the Trump administration\u2019s lack of support. \u201cTrump, as the proud owner of a dying brain, thought Macron was insulting him personally,\u201d Noah explained. Trump\u2019s defense of Nato is also a significant departure, Noah continued, pointing to a clip in which Trump called the treaty organization \u201cold\u201d, \u201cfat\u201d and \u201csloppy\u201d. \u201cWhy is it that every insult that Trump uses about others always seems to really be about himself?\u201d Noah wondered. \u201cEvery time he mocks other people, it\u2019s like a pain that\u2019s inside of him that he\u2019s trying to project on to others \u2026 It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s taking notes during his fights with Melania.\u201d And then there\u2019s also a trade war heating up between the US and France. Trump complained about a recently announced French tax on American tech companies such as Google, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to let people take advantage of American companies, because if anyone is going to take advantage of American companies, it\u2019s gonna be us.\u201d Noah translated Trump\u2019s logic: \u201cHow dare you take advantage of American companies \u2013 that\u2019s what I was gonna do.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s like the world\u2019s worst superhero,\u201d Noah marveled. \u201cHe\u2019ll like stop a mugger who\u2019s robbing an old lady, but only so he can fly off with her purse.\u201d In response to the French taxes, Trump is now threatening to tax \u201call the most cliched French goods like wine, cheese and handbags\u201d, Noah explained. \u201cHe was probably also going to tax French fries and mistresses, but that hit too close to home.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also recapped the president\u2019s trip to London for the Nato summit, starting with Trump\u2019s claim that if anyone was going to take advantage of American companies, it would be him. \u201cThat\u2019s right \u2013 nobody beats up my little brother except for me,\u201d Kimmel explained as reasoning. Kimmel also touched on Trump\u2019s issues with Macron\u2019s \u201cbraindead\u201d characterization of Nato. \u201cHe\u2019s right \u2013 what kind of a person would go around making disrespectful statements about Nato?\u201d Kimmel said before rolling a series of clips of Trump lambasting Nato as \u201cobsolete\u201d, \u201cripping us off\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s old, it\u2019s fat, it\u2019s sloppy\u201d. In other words, \u201cit\u2019s just like him\u201d, Kimmel said. Meanwhile, the House released its report based on the impeachment hearings, which revealed that according to phone records, the House intelligence committee member and notorious Trump loyalist Devin Nunes had multiple conversations with Lev Parnas, one of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s Ukrainian associates recently indicted for campaign finance violations. Nunes did not disclose the conversations to the committee nor recuse himself from the investigation; the revelation is \u201clike if we found out Judge Ito used to crash on OJ\u2019s couch or something\u201d, Kimmel explained. \u201cThis report explains why these Republicans around Trump keep saying he didn\u2019t do anything wrong: it\u2019s because they did the same stuff he did.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
