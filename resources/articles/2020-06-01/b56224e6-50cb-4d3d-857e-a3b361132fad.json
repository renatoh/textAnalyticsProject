I\u2019ve seen it all through my career. You see a footballer on a Monday or Tuesday and then it\u2019s all free and easy, they\u2019re nice and chatty, but then once you get later on in the week, once you get to Thursday and Friday, especially a Saturday, you see the pressure, you can just see it getting into their head and getting into their body and just see that they just want to go into their own world. You can see that pressure really does play on them a lot. And not having the crowd there will, without doubt, benefit some people. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get players coming into form that haven\u2019t been in form all season or low in confidence and then suddenly thriving. Whereas on the other side of the coin, you\u2019ve got players that need the crowd, you need the buzz, you need the adrenaline and you\u2019re not going to have the same sort of buzz.\u201d Watford played Brentford at Vicarage Road on Saturday, their second friendly there after another between two Watford XIs last week. At the time of the first game, Premier League clubs were discussing the possibility of playing crowd noise during matches and Watford trialled this \u2013 a largely unpopular innovation but one with great comic potential. \u201cIt really annoyed me,\u201d Foster said. \u201cYou can only play it at certain times, like when the ball goes out, when it would just come on and be really annoying. Everybody agreed we\u2019d rather not have it. We had one of the coaches refereeing and he was the worst referee ever, so they started playing: \u2018The referee\u2019s a wanker.\u2019 Nobody knew it was coming. Even he was laughing.\u201d The 37-year-old Foster, who joined from West Brom in 2018, signed a two-year contract last week and has declared an ambition to play into his 40s. \u201cEarlier in my career, especially when I turned 30, I would never have said there was any chance of me getting this late on,\u201d he said. \u201cWatford came at a very good time for me. It reignited something in me. I needed to go somewhere else for a new challenge.\u201d The challenge facing Foster now is to complete Watford\u2019s resurrection from being marooned at the foot of the table in mid-December to survival. \u201cIt was easy [during lockdown] to forget almost that we are still in a really precarious situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to come back to football but we\u2019ve still got a massive battle on our hands.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
