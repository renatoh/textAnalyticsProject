I think I may have actually enjoyed this episode. I know. It\u2019s extraordinary. I can\u2019t be sure, as I haven\u2019t enjoyed Downton for so long that I\u2019ve forgotten what it feels like. But I think it was enjoyment. It was, at the very least, a tingle. The trouble is, I have been rendered utterly demented by events of the past five and three quarter series and I have quite lost all my faculties. I wept copiously at numerous points. The blazing car that could have contained Henry but did not in the end! Bates urging Anna not to rush to the blazing car in her precarious condition! Andy confessing his illiteracy and trying to say \u201cTsar Nicholas\u201d! Edith getting a proposal from someone who is actually a nice person and hopefully not going to die! Molesley being cleverer than everyone from Oxford and Cambridge put together! A new baby Isis! It feels like the actors are pulling out every trick in the bag to make it through to the bitter end. They are greatly to be admired. The script is still as clunky and crazed as ever and the storylines leap around like a puppy trying to find new piece of Regency furniture to wee on in the library. But the acting holds up the crumbling edifice, whether it\u2019s Dame Maggie saying \u201cthe SS Paris\u201d as if it were 26 delicious words or Mr Carson falling asleep at the table after his MasterChef final. I struggle to believe that all the ends can be tied up next week. If Uncle Julian\u2019s previous form is anything to go by, we\u2019ll get several new plots and even some new characters too. I predict a lot of largely pointless shenanigans leading up to a massive cliffhanger ahead of the Christmas special. The Christmas special is when the weddings (and funerals?) will happen. Which is annoying as I was hoping it might all conclude nicely next week and the Christmas one could just be a sort of DVD extra which I could maybe get away with not watching. No chance. What must happen now? Anna\u2019s precarious baby needs to survive. Mary and Henry should just get married or she should start falling in love with Tom \u2013 and quickly. (I am now realising there might not actually be time for this to happen. That is irritating.) Something good must happen to Barrow. And Edith must find a way to tell Coffee-Making Man about the Ginger Impostor Child before Mary tells him first. I loved the bit where he said: \u201cYou want to bring your family\u2019s ward into the marriage with you? It\u2019s a bit weird. But why not?\u201d (I paraphrase.) Random subplot alert Now this one really is random: Mrs Patmore\u2019s organic B&amp;B with its locally sourced, gluten-free breakfasts highly rated on TripAdvisor. (\u201cIt was just like being served by a cook from a stately home. Five stars.\u201d) Where exactly are we going with this? Of course, it has to go wrong so that Mrs Patmore can fall in love with Mr Mason and become Daisy\u2019s real mother. But does it really have to fail? It seemed as if there was a man in the bushes taking a photograph of Mrs Patmore \u2013 because she\u2019s moonlighting and/or not paying tax? Or are her B&amp;B guests going to turn out to be people having affairs and Mrs Patmore is to be portrayed as the new Cynthia Payne? Either way, this is all highly ill-advised, especially one hour from the series\u2019 close. (I\u2019m putting my party hat on now in readiness.) Surprise character development \u201cWe know what you\u2019ve got to do, Mr Barrow.\u201d This is just cruel. Barrow\u2019s humiliation continues. And we can only pay tribute to the genius of Rob James Collier that he has pulled off all the handbrake turns his character is forced to execute. One minute he\u2019s the epitome of all evil and the definition of \u201cconniving\u201d. (We liked him best then.) The next minute he\u2019s a troubled war hero/coward (with the Maroon Leather Glove of Doom \u2013 oh, I miss it). The next minute his sexuality is painfully misunderstood. And now he has become someone to whom Carson just says repeatedly: \u201cI wish you would just leave.\u201d This is incredibly silly because if Carson wanted rid of him, he would get rid of him. There is now no time for him to fall into a glorious, consummated bromance with illiterate Andy. But if only there were \u2026 Golden eyebrow of the week award Carson is just walking away with it this series. There wasn\u2019t much eyebrow in the Carson-as-Bad-Mary-Berry baking scene, that was all furrowed forehead and then Mr Sleepy. But it was full-on eyebrow alert when Carson and Mrs Hughes performed the illegal sofa infiltration. Barrow: \u201cWhat have we here? Can anyone join in?\u201d Carson: \u201cNo, Mr Barrow, they cannot.\u201d Carson\u2019s eyebrows catapulted so far north they almost knocked some books off the library shelves. A golden one to you yet again, Mr Carson. Sorry, could you just repeat that awkward line of dialogue? \u201cIf love is allowed to weigh in the balance \u2026 I\u2019ve got plenty of that.\u201d Go, Coffee-Making Land Agent Man! \u201cIn the new century, anything is possible.\u201d Hmm. It is 1925. Just how exactly does that consitute \u201ca new century\u201d after 25 years? Here in 2015, do we still refer to the 21st century as \u201cthe new century\u201d? I think not. \u201cWhen will it be over?\u201d \u201cNot soon. They go round and round.\u201d The best description of Formula 1 ever. Uncle Julian\u2019s been on the Google again. \u201cSo there we have it, I\u2019m a fool who knows nothing. I am nothing.\u201d I will love you, fool! Next week There is a local brou-haha! Edith calls Mary a bitch! And Henry calls Mary a gold-digger!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
