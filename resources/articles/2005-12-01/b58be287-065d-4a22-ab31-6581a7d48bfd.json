The Brazil international feels the squad should have reacted better to their former captain's sale and says he now has a responsibility along with the other senior players to guide the team through a difficult period. Gilberto is well placed to analyse the impact of his central midfield partner's sale to Juventus and implies that the effects of Vieira's transfer were keenly felt in the early-season defeats at Chelsea, Middlesbrough and West Bromwich which have undermined Arsenal's championship challenge. \"I think we worried a bit too much about his departure and when we woke up we [had] lost some games and it was very difficult for us,\" he says. \"Patrick was a fantastic leader for us and when he left it was difficult for us at the beginning to accept his decision. \"Of course we respected that but it was very difficult when we came to training and Patrick was not here,\" he adds. \"It was different. [But] we need to play without him and support the young players.\" But there was no criticism of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's decision to sanction the sale as Gilberto reflected on how the absence of Vieira and Edu, who also left in the summer, has been felt. \"I think [we miss] the experience of both players in the middle of the park because in [that] part of the pitch you need to be really strong,\" he says. \"It can decide a game. They were also important because they brought good things to the dressing room that made the atmosphere good and when someone was down they lifted us. It was not just about football.\" The 29-year-old feels that the team's problems are more \"psychological than technical\" and argues that greater self-belief is vital when Arsenal go to Charlton on Boxing Day seeking to end a run of three Premiership defeats. But he maintains that the club still has a highly talented squad. He acknowledges, though, that Cesc F\u00e1bregas and Mathieu Flamini found it hard against Michael Essien and Claude Makelele in last weekend's defeat by Chelsea. \"For Cesc it's tough because he's not strong enough compared to Essien and Makelele,\" the World Cup winner says. \"Plus, experienced players know the way they have to play in the middle of the park and for young players sometimes it's difficult.\" Arsenal must return to form at The Valley in a game crucial to their pursuit of a Champions League spot. \"We have to switch on,\" he admits. \"The team know that and want to win because this situation is very uncomfortable for us. Since I've been here I have never had a situation like this [but] we will overcome it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
