I never thought parliament would tell me to choose between being an MP and being a mum. My Labour colleague Tulip Siddiq was forced to postpone a C-section so she could cast a vote in the debate on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal in January and that caused a rightful outcry. Westminster can \u2013 when it wants \u2013 make it possible to combine parenthood with legislating and Siddiq\u2019s push for progress on a system that would have allowed her to vote by proxy demonstrates it. But allowing an MP to nominate someone to vote on their behalf when they need to be at home with their children is just one piece of a much bigger equality puzzle. During my first miscarriage, aching and bleeding, I joined a protest for the extradition of a man who had raped and murdered a constituent. The day after I found out that another baby\u2019s heartbeat had stopped, I led a public meeting on gang crime. I even scheduled the procedure to remove the body on a day I didn\u2019t have a constituency advice surgery. Heartbroken by all the years that I have struggled with fertility, I\u2019ve kept these events to myself and made sure my constituents have never been affected. Now I\u2019m pregnant once more and terrified \u2013 not just that it will go wrong again, but because I know that my resolve to keep my private and professional lives separate has become impossible. I\u2019m coming forward publicly to talk about it because, as for far too many women, the personal inevitably becomes political when reproduction is involved. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) is the independent body that since 2009 has, on behalf of taxpayers, regulated the pay of MPs and authorised the budgets we claim for our work. Ipsa has a duty to ensure that we are resourced appropriately to carry out parliamentary duties. But it says it does not \u201crecognise\u201d that MPs go on maternity leave. Thus, it feels no responsibility to make provision for any paid cover for what we do outside the parliamentary chamber: the campaigns, constituency casework and municipal work that all MPs do. Harriet Harman wrote movingly of trying to cover constituency duties with babies in tow in the 1980s. Despite warm words about maternity cover two years ago from Ipsa, things have gone backwards. Humiliatingly, it is making me beg for extra staff funding \u2013 or give up any chance of spending time with my child to make sure my constituents don\u2019t miss out. If a GP or vicar were on leave, a locum would be provided to ensure continuity of community services. In Denmark a member of the national parliament would have a substitute MP appointed. My experience is not unique. Other MPs who have had children since Ipsa was created have told me of the same rejection of their requests for help on the basis that MPs \u201cdo not take maternity leave\u201d. Siddiq herself had to return to doing casework three days after a C-section. Some MPs have tried to be with their newborn child at least for a few weeks, hoping residents don\u2019t notice their absence and the correspondence doesn\u2019t pile up too much, or begging colleagues to cover casework. Several have ended up taking their children with them to meetings so they can feed them, with constituents acting as proxy babysitters while trying to talk to their representative. No community should miss out on representation because its MP is pregnant \u2013 nor should my opponents be able to argue there\u2019s a cost to my constituents because I may succeed in my quest to conceive. For all the talk of being family friendly, Westminster is still struggling to offer deeds instead of words. And if we can\u2019t get this right for MPs, how can we get this right for parents elsewhere? Britain still has a long way to go to ensure that fertility isn\u2019t a barrier to equality. A third of employers think it\u2019s acceptable to ask women about their plans for having a family at a job interview. Non-disclosure agreements are used frequently to cover up pregnancy discrimination, with the legal advice service Pregnant Then Screwed receiving on average 350 calls a year. This inequality isn\u2019t just in the workplace. Fertility treatment is a minefield in terms of access and quality, leading many to go abroad. If thousands of Brits went overseas for experimental optometry, it would be a national priority to ensure no one returned blind. But women are left to congregate in online chatrooms to share IVF reviews and pricing plans, as a commercial industry supplants public provision in a way we wouldn\u2019t accept with any other branch of healthcare. Increasingly, our bodies are the battlefield of political change. We need to bring together the fight for the right to reproduce and the right not to do so \u2013 not least because in these Trump-inspired times those who seek to control women find it politically expedient. In Georgia, Ohio, Kentucky, Mississippi and Louisiana I would potentially have faced a criminal investigation to ensure I had not caused my own miscarriages because they were later than their six-week abortion deadline. Our own government forces women to continue unwanted pregnancies by retaining an outright ban on abortion in Northern Ireland. Prejudices and unhelpful tropes about motherhood suffocate female representatives \u2013 whether we have children or not \u2013 in a way that is rarely true for our male counterparts. For my work on abortion rights I have been trolled relentlessly with the charge that it is my own childlessness that drives my \u201cdesire to kill other people\u2019s babies\u201d. Campaigners opposed to providing LGBT sex and relationship education in schools once surrounded me in my constituency screaming that I didn\u2019t have children of my own, so how could I understand their concerns. My political opponents have printed campaign leaflets highlighting their candidates\u2019 motherhood and marriage to demonstrate how I was deficient. When I talk to male colleagues \u2013 whether fathers or not \u2013 none of this behaviour even rings a bell. Achieving a world in which women are not discriminated against because they can carry children means challenging all of these attitudes \u2013 and the policies that go with them. From the parliamentary authorities to our healthcare services and workplaces, it\u2019s time to stop asking nicely for the discrimination to be dealt with. It is time to refuse to wait patiently and instead to make it a a priority. As a politician I\u2019ve never stopped fighting for women to have control over their own bodies through the provision of reproductive rights and services as the non-negotiable prerequisite of equality. As a pregnant woman this recent experience is another bitter reminder that it\u2019s still often men \u2013 this time the Ipsa executives \u2013 who will make the choices that determine if that battle will be won. \u2022 Stella Creasy is the Labour and Co-operative MP for Walthamstow"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
