Instead of zipping along, riders were shown on a local news channel wheeling the Lime hire scooters along the wide pavements of Old Market. The streets in this part of town are paved with small red cobbles \u2013 problematic for the tiny wheels of the scooters. \u201cYou can\u2019t bring something like that to an area like this and think people aren\u2019t going to be on the sidewalks,\u201d one passerby told 3 News Now. \u201cThey\u2019re not safe enough to be on the roads,\u201d added another, who opted for the city\u2019s hire bikes instead. \u201cI feel like they change direction really quickly [on the cobbles]. They belong on the pavements.\u201d In London and other British cities the 1835 Highways Act currently makes their use illegal anyway \u2013 an example of cutting-edge technology butting heads with 19th-century legislation \u2013 but almost two years since the first appearance of dockless e-scooters, hundreds of cities around the world are still grappling with the same issue as Omaha. Should they welcome them with open arms like Antwerp? Introduce a permit system like San Francisco? Make use of their data like Portland, Oregon? Or ban them completely? Arrive first, ask later E-scooters first appeared in Santa Monica, California, in September 2017 almost overnight \u2013 and neither legislation nor city officials were ready. Within two months the city had filed a criminal complaint against the company behind them, Bird, for operating without a business licence, and for blocking sidewalks. The city was awarded $300,000 (\u00a3235,000) in fines and licence fees. The pattern was repeated in San Francisco, where chaos ensued as hundreds of e-scooters from several different operators appeared simultaneously in March 2018. There were complaints of users riding on sidewalks, scooters blocking pedestrian space, and broken scooters left abandoned. To tackle these issues, and stem numbers, city leaders introduced a permit system without which scooter companies could not operate. In June 2018 San Francisco refused permits to the biggest players. A city attorney sent a cease and desist letter, forcing them to withdraw, and accused the companies of ignoring warnings and operating in a way that created a public nuisance. The city did realise the transportation potential for e-scooters, though, and granted permits to two smaller companies, Skip and Scoot, for up to 625 scooters each as part of a 24-month pilot. During this time, the two firms will provide the city with trip data, and operate in communities underserved by public transport. The invitation wasn\u2019t extended to Bird and Lime, but in August both were given permits to operate in Santa Monica. The early \u201carrive first, ask later\u201d tactics of scooter companies had perhaps riled cities, and they wanted to show they were in charge. Aaron Peskin, who co-wrote San Francisco\u2019s e-scooter permit bill, was quoted by Wired as saying: \u201cIt would be very nice if the tech bros could come in and ask in a collaborative fashion for permission rather than after-the-fact forgiveness.\u201d This remains a common complaint, says Nicole Payne of Nacto, the city transportation officials association: \u201cCompanies may come in before the permit process is formalised \u2026 [or] undermine city authorities by passing laws at the state level. Cities must keep their authority over their streets.\u201d City officials are having to learn fast. St Louis, Missouri, removed Bird e-scooters from its streets the day after their overnight appearance in July 2018, Bird apparently having submitted the necessary paperwork without waiting for the permit. Companies can now only expand past 2,500 bikes in St Louis if they develop and implement a social equity plan. E-scooter companies, though, may be unwilling to go quietly. Bird filed a lawsuit against Beverly Hills in November over a six-month ban imposed because the city said their e-scooters appeared with \u201ca lack of any advanced planning and outreach\u201d. Richard Corbett, head of Bird UK, is unapologetic for the company\u2019s earlier shock and awe tactics. \u201cI think when you\u2019re innovating and you\u2019re disrupting, for better or worse, there\u2019s going to be that clash between the way things happened in the past and the way they will happen in the future,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be that evolutionary phase where we\u2019re like, \u2018OK, this is how we used to do things for the last 100 years, this is how cars have become the centre of our world, and this is why we need to move on.\u2019\u201d Learning to collaborate By August last year, when Bird launched in Paris, the company had drawn up a charter of good practice and clarified usage rules. It found 70% of journeys made on Birds were for work, school or personal errands. Bird continued that more collaborative approach in the Belgian city of Antwerp \u2013 although only after scooters from rival Lime appeared overnight. Antwerp\u2019s vice-mayor Koen Kennis describes Lime\u2019s move as \u201ccheeky\u201d. \u201cWe saw the scooters in the street and we said, \u2018There is a problem, you will have to take them away,\u2019\u201d he says. After Lime\u2019s incursion, the city introduced a permit system, granting three companies access on a first come, first served basis. Trotti, Poppi and Bird now have scooters spread between the city centre and less well-served areas outside the ring road. Kennis believes e-scooters can work, especially in a city with a decade of bike share under its belt and where he says residents \u201cget\u201d shared mobility: \u201cWe have a lot of streets where it\u2019s easy to go.\u201d But he believes a successful bike share is not a prerequisite. \u201cI believe in most cities this can work,\u201d he adds. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s more difficult when you\u2019re a city that\u2019s still very strong on cars, because people need the place to ride around a scooter \u2026 [but] it helps us to create modal shift.\u201d E-scooters have also been hailed a success in Tel Aviv, where residents use them en masse to escape the city\u2019s chronic traffic congestion \u2013 using existing bike lanes. Lime and Bird operate in Tel Aviv, and according to one source there were 25,000 unique Bird users in the quarter to October. There are opportunities \u2013 early data shows dockless scooters\u2019 potential is perhaps strongest in moving short leisure and recreation trips out of cars \u2013 but for cities to benefit, Nacto recommends officials draw up permits and specify operation zones, control numbers and enforce operational standards. If companies don\u2019t comply, cities need the power to revoke licences. Cities can also request trip data from scooter operators. This can be a valuable commodity in city planning, so long as users aren\u2019t required to share personal information with providers. Portland, Oregon, allowed e-scooters access to the city on a trial basis between July and November 2018, on the condition they shared their data and operated in underserved parts of the city \u2013 not just downtown. They also surveyed 3,444 users and found 83% were scootering for fun, with just 18% commuting \u2013 and the proportion of trips for commutes fell by the second usage and beyond. A positive finding was that 38% of respondents said they drove less, 44% used taxis less and 31% used car share less. A second pilot will launch soon, lasting roughly a year. Britain \u2018fails to keep pace\u2019 For British cities, introducing e-scooters means first changing centuries-old national legislation. E-scooters are illegal on the UK\u2019s roads and pavements, though they are legal to buy, and they are increasingly regular features on city streets and bike lanes. \u201cSaying the legislation is failing to keep pace is perhaps an understatement,\u201d says Transport for London\u2019s director of transport innovation, Michael Hurwitz. \u201cWe are still talking about the 1835 Highways Act.\u201d The only place where it is currently possible to hire one in Britain is the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London. Opened for the 2012 Olympics, the park is effectively private land, and touts itself as the UK\u2019s \u201csandbox\u201d for micromobility and innovative transport. That could be about to change after the Department for Transport announced a review of archaic legislation, the Highways Act included, but there is no guarantee. Corbett says Bird is playing a long game in London \u2013 and perhaps the company has learned its lesson from North America. \u201cLondon and the UK is one of the biggest markets globally for any business,\u201d he says, \u201cand it\u2019s very attractive, but you\u2019re not going to succeed unless you work in partnership and that\u2019s fundamental to sustainability of the service. If you can make it here you can make it anywhere, because the standards are so high.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
