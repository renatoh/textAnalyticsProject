Mark Cueto wing \u2013 5 Competent in everything, from taking quick lineouts, clearances and making tackles. Had to make do with a meagre diet of possession. Mathew Tait centre \u2013 4 The odd sidestep and half-break could not make up for slipshod defending. Made the two men opposite him seem like world-beaters on the break. Riki Flutey centre \u2013 5 Like Tait, he was exposed in defence by the straight running of the Scottish centres. When he did make a crucial tackle he ruined it by hanging on too long. Ugo Monye wing \u2013 5 Cut infield to look for the ball more than Cueto, much good it did him in an England unit devoid of cohesion. Carried off after an ugly clash with Kelly Brown. Jonny Wilkinson fly-half \u2013 6 Kicked his penalties and made his tackles. Strived to spark a little snap and crackle in attack, but his passes never quite seemed to find their target. Danny Care scrum-half \u2013 5 Andy Robinson had identified him as a threat and Scotland neutralised him well. Tried a few of his sneaky breaks, but was invariably called back by the referee. Tim Payne prop \u2013 5 Part of a front row who failed to assert themselves in the loose and bored the spectators by spoiling the scrum. Surely just keeping the place warm till the autumn. Dylan Hartley hooker \u2013 4 A step backwards for one of England's few improving players. A wonky throw spoiled an attacking lineout, and his temper should have cost him a yellow card. Dan Cole prop \u2013 4 Conceded the penalty that gave away an early lead and along with Allan Jacobsen he was responsible for a series of reset scrums because of bad binding. Louis Deacon lock \u2013 4 England's invisible man. Managed to pop up once in the loose and duly spilled the ball forward, coughing up good possession. Steve Borthwick (capt) lock \u2013 5 Played well, but lacking as a leader. Had plenty of words for the referee, but should have spared a few for his own pack, who committed a string of silly offences. James Haskell flanker \u2013 5 In the thick of it throughout, but to little effect. Tried a lot of ambitious off-loads, few of which ever seemed to find their man. Joe Worsley flanker \u2013 7 Made enough tackles to cover the workload of two men. Threw his body in the way of Scottish attacks as though he did not know what pain is. Nick Easter No8 \u2013 6 Rumbled around the field barging into tackles and banging into the breakdown. There was nothing spectacular, but it was a solid afternoon's graft."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
