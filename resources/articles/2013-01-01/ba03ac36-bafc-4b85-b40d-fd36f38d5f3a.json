Twice coming from two sets down, Taylor eventually saw off the Dutchman Michael van Gerwen in magisterial style, winning the match 7-4 and leaving the stage choked with tears both of triumph and a familiar champion's exhaustion. From the start this was a final of relentlessly high-wire darts, an adrenal exchange of high-velocity scoring that saw five of the first seven sets go to a last leg shoot-out. Van Gerwen, who appeared to be capable of sweeping Taylor away with his early momentum, will be accused of having choked rather horribly here. But really, this was all about Taylor reasserting his venerable qualities of era-domination in the face of the younger generation. On these big nights, the cavernous central hall of Alexandra Palace becomes a steamy, tropical darting menagerie, and as Van Gerwen \u2013 almost 30 years Taylor's junior \u2013 entered the arena, flexing his biceps and rolling his neck in a show of pre-match warrior-excitement, the massed Pink Panthers, witches, Wallies, lions, leopards and drunks of the Palace floor rose in raucous approval. It was in sharp contrast to the scattered boos that initially greeted Taylor's appearance, a hangover from the unsporting post-match handshake-shemozzle that soured his semi-final defeat of Raymond van Barneveld. This was the final all darts fans wanted, the sport's modern day totem taking on the coming man of the tungsten tip. If Taylor remains enshrined as a kind of darting Elvis, enduring King of the grand-stage oche, for the 23-year-old van Gerwen this was an opportunity to confirm what his vibrant talent has already suggested \u2013 that the Dutchman is destined to flower into a genuinely dominant force. The contrast between the two was clear from the start. Where Taylor seems silkily composed at the oche, a single arm flexing smoothly like a man changing gear in his Mercedes, Van Gerwen throws with his whole body, leaning forward and addressing the board as though, deep down, he wants to rip its head off. The Dutchman nosed ahead aggressively in the early exchanges. There were wild roaring celebrations as he clinched the first set, and further venomous gurning fury as the pressure began to tell in the second, which slipped away in double-quick time. This was not so much champagne darts as amphetamine darts, Van Gerwen's very physical show of aggression leaving Taylor looking not just puzzled but fretful. This, though, is a sportsman who trades on his competitive steel. Taylor resisted quietly and, against all expectations, Van Gerwen suddenly crumpled, throwing his loosest legs of the championship as Taylor began to assert his more glacial rhythms at the oche, taking the third set and placing a bulwark in the way of his opponent's momentum. The fourth set again went to the final leg. Taylor, nerveless, nailed double top to level the match at 2-2. Suddenly it was the 15-time champion thrusting his hips in coquettish satin-shirted glee. Van Gerwen found his edge again, throwing messy, forceful, aggressive darts, but scoring heavily and taking another blink-and-you're-gone set. By now he was approaching the oche like a pear-shaped medium pacer coming bustling in to bowl, sealing a 4-2 set lead with a thrilling double 18 finish. And yet, it is folly to discount Taylor's champion resolve. Again Van Gerwen experienced an adrenaline-crash as Taylor pulled it back to 4-3 and then 4-4, as his opponent was being dragged into the uncharted waters of a horribly gruelling long-game final. An extraordinary five-leg ninth set saw Taylor take the lead for the first time two hours into the match, having twice been two sets down. This was by now a darting resurrection. A fourth consecutive set went his way. And so to the final knockings, with Van Gerwen now a limp and dispirited figure. The last leg was in effect a lap of honour, Taylor already waving and pointing to the crowd, clowning almost as he sealed the conclusive double 16. From the champion there was a single rather reserved punch of the air. From the crowd there were no boos now, just a sozzled, and entirely affectionate tribute from all corners to a man who continues to dominate quietly this noisiest of sports. Van Gerwen was generous in defeat: shoulders slumped he drifted off stage, still perhaps the future of darts, but here flattened by a peerless champion of the enduring status quo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
