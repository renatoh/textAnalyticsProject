Can knows he must seize every opportunity to impress Joachim L\u00f6w, who has such a plethora of talent that the squad he picks for next summer\u2019s World Cup will necessarily exclude players who would be starters for most countries. \u201c[The competition for places] helps because you always have to be ready, always giving 100%,\u201d Can said. \u201cIf you have one bad season, maybe you aren\u2019t in the squad. That\u2019s normal because we have so many good young players, a big, big pool of players.\u201d Germany\u2019s strength in Can\u2019s position seems particularly lavish in a week when Gareth Southgate considers that the absence of Jordan Henderson opens doors for international rookies such as Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Jake Livermore. Can is one of several players vying for a spot in midfield where the established starters, such as Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira, have won the World Cup. Even they are under pressure to ensure their performances do not drop. When L\u00f6w omitted his top players for the summer\u2019s Confederations Cup, Can and Sebastian Rudy helped Germany win the tournament, as did Leon Goretzka, the 22-year-old Schalke midfielder who is out injured but will be back in time for the World Cup. In addition, Manchester City\u2019s Ilkay G\u00fcndogan has returned to Germany\u2019s squad for Friday\u2019s match at Wembley following a year\u2019s absence with a cruciate ligament injury. \u201cWe went to the Confederations Cup with a young team so I don\u2019t think many people expected us to win that. We played a lot of players who hadn\u2019t been in the national team,\u201d Can said. \u201cSo to win it, playing a great tournament, [means] a lot of nations have respect. The under-21s also won [the European Championship] so everyone can see how big and how good the group is in Germany.\u201d Last month Can, who has 18 caps, scored his first goal for his country in the 5-1 victory over Azerbaijan. He started that match and aims to make that a regular occurrence. \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy to come to the national team and be on the bench,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to show myself at Liverpool and when I come to the national team I try to show myself in training or in games. It\u2019s my second year here and one day I want to be a starting player. It won\u2019t be easy. But that\u2019s why I try.\u201d Can must deal with a complication that is not faced by Germany midfielders who are not based in England. \u201cIt\u2019s different if you have a two-week break in winter. For example, last year when the Bundesliga had a break we [at Liverpool] had 10 games in that time. That is a big difference. Sometimes you just need to speak to your manager to get a few days off because your body will need it.\u201d Can is well placed to know there are signs that England, too, are developing greater strength in depth. Several of his young team-mates at Anfield have international ambitions and Southgate has selected one of them, Joe Gomez, for the latest squad. \u201cLast year he wasn\u2019t always lucky with injuries but this season he has come back strong,\u201d said Can of his 20-year-old club-mate. \u201cHe has always played well, both at right-back and at centre-back. He deserves to play for the national team. I hope the others will go the same way. Dom Solanke is there. [Liverpool] have a lot of good young players and I hope they will all go the same way as Joe.\u201d If they do, it will be partly thanks to a German, J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cYou can see the belief he has in Joe. Last year he had the injuries but when he came back and had a very good pre-season, the trainer showed belief in him and now he is playing regularly. So you can see how you can deal with it at a club who always has young players.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
