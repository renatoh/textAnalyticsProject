We find them now in troubled times, after the previous manager, Gheorghe Hagi, walked out a couple of weeks ago in disgust at the alleged meddling of the owner and one-time presidential candidate, George \"Gigi\" Becali. The current manager, Massimo Pedrazzini is thought to be under similar pressures. His counterpart, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, is of course riding high - top of the Premier League with a club in rude financial health and bursting with young talent. He does indeed warrant the nickname I've given (stolen for) him: Stupor Mundi - \"the wonder of the world\". He's certainly better at looking after his kids than Britney Spears anyway. Back to business. Steaua Bucharest have an unbeaten record in five games against English clubs at home. These teams have never met in a competitive match and Arsenal have only ever played one Romanian side, Dinamo Bacau in the1969-70 Fairs Cup, running out 9-1 aggregate winners. Steaua are the only Romanian side to play in the Champions League but have never progressed beyond the group stages and did not start this campaign well, losing 2-1 to Slavia Prague in the first round of matches. The Gunners, by contrast, looked superb in their 3-0 home victory over Sevilla. Has anyone out there been to Bucharest/Romania? Try to keep Dracula/Transylvania jokes to a minimum... The bookmakers certainly don't fancy Steaua. Even as long as 5-1 on them to win at home! That's the kiss of death, then. Looks like a pretty terrible attendance here - a few thousand at most. A club in trouble it seems. Manuel Almunia in goal again for Arsenal, so it seems Jens Lehmann is now officially the No2. \"European nights in Bucharest used to be in black and white, shrouded in fog, with a possibly poisoned XI taking on a team of full-time \"soldiers\" in front of glowering colonels and party apparatchiks. And Alan Weekes commentating. Is it wrong to feel nostalgic for those times?\" says Gary Naylor. I used to love that crackling-end-of-phoneline sound. 1 min: And so here we go. Arsenal kicking off. Looks like there could be a lot of space for Arsenal runners in their white away kits. 3 min:Robin van Persie might have had his legs taken from under him in the area after a nice cross from Alexandr Hleb. Mr Heauge was not interested though. 5 min: Cross into the Arsenal box and Valentin Badea fluffs a free header. A bit sloppy from Arsenal. Steaua look pretty energetic and lively. 7 min:Steaua have the ball in the Arsenal net but it is disallowed for offside. 8 min: Terrible miss by Cesc F\u00e0bregas from five metres out after a lovely lay back by Hleb. 10 min: A very lively game here. A corner for Arsenal from their left is turned into a quick break by Steaua but it is stifled out quickly. 12 min: Although there are no more than 15,000 people here the local fans certainly make a racket when their team are on the attack. \"I've been to Bucharest. No disrespect to the people who I'm sure are lovely but it's the most soulless city in Europe - I think Ceacescu bulldozed the entire old town to build his monstrous palace,\" says David Bell. Grim reading folks. 14 min:A nice run down the right from Bacary Sagna, showing why he has fitted in to this side so well. Booking: Oh dear...Emmanuel Adebayor got narked by being given offside for the second time, kicked the ball into the net and incurred the displeasure of the referee. 17 min: Free-kick awarded after a foul by Ovidiu Petre on Hleb. Arsenal make a bit of a hash it. Booking: Petre Marin gets a yellow for kicking the ball away. These footballers eh? Will they ever learn. No. 20 min: Lovely low straight drive from Nicolae Dica to Almunia's left that goes just wide. Aturo Wallace suspects the gene pool in Romania was depleted by rapacious soldiers from the Ottoman Empire, which \"explains\" why there are fewer pretty girls in the country than there might have been otherwise. I have no way of checking this, obviously. 26 min: Steaua seem to be trying to frustrate Mathieu Flamini in particular. Robin Van Persie goes down under a nasty challenge from Marin. Kolo Tour\u00e9 gets forward from the free-kick but can't get to the cross. 29 min: Adebayor gets into a great position to score on the left but makes a weak cross rather having a shot. A wasted opportunity. \"Hello from Bucharest. Just wanted to clarify something - Steaua are the best-supported club in Romania. The reason for the poor attendance - the ridiculous ticket prices. We live here and went to the game on Saturday for \u00a34 (best seats). For this game the same seats are well over \u00a350. Average salary in Romania \u00a3300 a month. Enough said. John &amp; Jo. Fortza Steaua.\" Thanks for that chaps. Booking: Could be a mistake from the ref. He booked Ionut Rada but looks like the challenge was from Petre. Well - there were two challenges at the almost the same time. Petre needs to be careful. 35 min: Another really clumsy challenge by Petre on Hleb. He's got one foot on a tightrope and the other on thin ice, which is no mean feat. 36 min: Lovely move with precision passing from Hleb and F\u00e0bregas, but Hleb's shot is blooked. 38 min: Petre again, but this time a wild shot that goes over. 40 min:Steaua are certainly taking it to Arsenal and the London side haven't created too many chances. 41 min: Clichy's shot looks like it's gone over the line. Close but no cigar, says the referee. \"I've been to Bucharest. The only vampires there are the voracious mosquitoes,\" says Joanna Epstein. 42 min:Flamini has a rasping shot saved by the Colombian Robinson Zapata (no moustache). Half-time: Well it's been surprisingly tense here. No score. Daniel from the US of A writes: \"When you say you stole the stupor mundi title for Wenger, do you mean you stole it from a fellow pundit or from Frederick II, the accused antichrist?\" The answer, Daniel, is Frederick II, the German Emperor in the first half of the 13th century. Well done. 46 min: We're back. And this time in the right order. A Brucie would say: \"Here comes my clarification, my clarification is here\" - it seems Petre was not booked after all. We've had a complaint about the history reference, so I've been instructed to ask you for more \"Men and Motors\" type questions and comments please. 49 min: Not really the same hot-headed atmosphere for the start of the second half as for the first. The calmer feel will surely help Arsenal to take control of the game. 53 min:Some lovely passing from F\u00e0bregas, Adebayor, Flamini and co but very little to show for it. Still - there's nothing wrong with being patient and picking your moment. 55 min: Arsenal corner cleared and Steaua race upfield. Banel Nicolita playes through to Badea in space but he's offiside. 56 min: F\u00e0bregas free-kick ends with diving header from Adebayor that is just kept out by Zapata. Actually, he does have a moustache but it isn't a \"Zapata\" moustache. It's a bit weedy. 58 min: Excellent long-range volley from Dica with Almunia off his line. The great Kolo Tour\u00e9 rescues a certain goal with a header. 61 min: Steaua sub: Victoras Iacob on for Badea. 62 min: Arsenal really starting to rev up now and getting into dangerous positions deep in Steaua territory. \"Strange comment about the lack of beautiful women in Romania. I recently got dumped by a singularly beautiful woman from Bucharest,\" says Paul Bradley. Blimey. I thought it was bad getting dumped by someone from your own country. Keep your chin up Paul. 67 min: Petre makes a lovely pass to Iacob down the right, whose cross is poor despite Petre following up into the area. Steaua are starting to get back into the game. 69 min: Nice control by Adebayor on the edge of the box - he passes to Van Persie, but the Dutchman's volley flashes over. 71 min: Best chance of the night falls to Iacob, who is clean through on goal with only Almunia to beat, but he manages to scoop the ball way over the bar. A let off for Wenger's men. You sense Arsenal would settle for a draw now. 73 min: Adebayor forces a corner on Arsenal's left side. The gangly Togan is working very hard. Arsenal sub: Gilberto Silva for Ebou\u00e9. The corner comes to nothing. Absolutely nothing. Someone pointed out that out picture of Wenger makes it look like he is watching with us. GOAL!!! Steaua 0-1 Arsenal (Van Persie, 76). Wenger bumps his head getting off his seat in delight! More great work from Adebayor, who jinks it back and Van Persie smashes it into the top of the net. A really well-worked goal and fine finish. 78 min: Steaua sub: Dorel Zaharia for Neaga. Just when it seemed Arsenal were staring at a nervous final 15 minutes their persistence pays off. Gilberto Silva appears to be calming influence too. 82 min: Arsenal just trying to keep possession so they can kill the game off now. They have to keep their wits about them though. A lot of credit should go to Flamini for chasing back when they do lose the ball. 85 min: Steaua sub: Valentin Badoi for Romeo Surdu. \"Please tell Aturo Wallace that my wife is Turkish, descended from Ottomans - obviously, and is BEAUTIFUL. We also have three lovely daughters, so mixing up the gene pool has its advantages!\" writes Phil West. Well said, Phil. We're all about peace and harmony here. This is the Guardian, you know. 90 min: When they get a chance Arsenal are still looking to push it forward and there is some pretty passing on show right to the bitter end. A corner from the left (taken very, very slowly) is shuffled around as the clock ticks down. Full-time: Well there's the final whistle and this Arsenal team take another step on the ladder to maturity. Their ninth win in a row means they have six points from two Champions League matches and seem to have discarded that nasty knack of falling apart away from home in Europe - especially eastern Europe. A very satisfactory night all round. Apologies for technical problems at the start and thanks for all your emails.
