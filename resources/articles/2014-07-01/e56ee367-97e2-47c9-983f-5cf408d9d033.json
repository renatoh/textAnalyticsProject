Tony Hall, the BBC director general, is to outline in a speech on Thursday what he will describe as a \"competition revolution\" in which the corporation's in-house programme-making departments, responsible for shows ranging from Doctor Who to Strictly Come Dancing and Top Gear, would for the first time be given free rein to produce shows for other channels in the UK and around the world. Hall also plans to open up the BBC's schedules to independent production companies, which already make popular shows including Sherlock, Rev and The Great British Bake Off, but are ultimately limited to a certain level of programming by annual quotas. This radical move to reinvent the BBC for the digital media era will be seen as Hall's attempt to seize the initiative in the debate about the corporation's future direction, ahead of negotiations with the government about the renewal of the BBC's royal charter and licence fee funding agreement, due to begin in earnest after the 2015 general election. However, it remains to be seen how the idea will be greeted by politicians and the TV industry. The decision would require sweeping regulatory changes to be incorporated into the BBC charter from 2017. \"If independent producers can take their ideas to any broadcaster around the world, I would want the same for the BBC,\" Hall will say. \"Proper competition and entrepreneurialism requires a level playing field. We should have regulation in the TV supply market only where it's needed so that we can let creativity flourish ... A level playing field doesn't tilt.\" Hall's proposal looks to address both criticism of BBC in-house production, described by its detractors as bloated and inefficient, and calls by independent producers to open up more of the corporation's output to competition. The BBC's in-house production departments have cut back their full time staff numbers significantly in the past two decades, and along with the rest of the industry rely more heavily on freelance and contract employees. However, the BBC remains one of world's largest TV production studios, with about 2,500 staff. at any given time making shows ranging from ratings bankers including EastEnders to Sir David Attenborough natural history series such as Africa. BBC in-house TV production would be hived off into a separate commercial subsidiary under Hall's plans, making programmes for both the corporation and other broadcasters.But Hall, speaking at The Future of the Licence Fee event at London's City University, will acknowledge that smaller producers may still require special protection, adding: \"I want to work with them and their representatives \u2026 on a system that can help grow new production companies.\" Hall believes the BBC will flourish in an open market and will look for other areas where it can be opened up to greater competition according to a new corporation mantra of \"compete or compare\". The corporation believes the proposals will drive down costs and encourage innovation. However, there is also a danger that it could lead to its channels being less distinctive and the possibility of public confusion over what the licence fee is for, if familiar BBC names and brands appear on a rival channel. There is also the possibility of an intervention by the European Commission over the issue of illegal cross subsidy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
