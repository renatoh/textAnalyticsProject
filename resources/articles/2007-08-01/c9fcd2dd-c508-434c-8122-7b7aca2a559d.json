But while there are comically callous anecdotes and references to medical slang (a fracture of the fourth metatarsal is a \"Rooney\" and patients are defined by their TTT - tattoos to teeth - ratio) much of it is written with tenderness and compassion. The author, who uses the pseudonym Dr Nick Edwards, has an overriding purpose in writing the book. In Stitches is an attempt to explain why an increasing number of doctors, nurses and other health service workers are fed up and disillusioned with the direction that New Labour is taking the NHS. The book details the ways in which privatisation is sucking money and resources away from NHS hospitals, and how a fragmented GP out-of-hours service is putting more pressure on A&amp;E. It bemoans the pointless and self-serving bureaucracy, and a target culture so rigid that fiddling the books is the only way to ensure patient safety. Edwards also shines a light on some of the ills of modern society, which make fascinating but depressing reading: obesity, diabetes, drug abuse, mental illness, people refusing to take responsibility for themselves and expecting a miracle cure, drunk people, angry teenagers, pushy posh people, and yet more drunk people. Edwards says he first started writing in a cathartic blog. It was a way of keeping himself sane after a particularly traumatic cot death, and of preventing his wife, driven to distraction by his nightly rants, from filing for divorce. Most of the tales are composites of his own and colleagues' experiences - both to protect himself and the confidentiality of his patients. It is a book written from the heart by someone in the NHS system struggling to come to terms with the health service of 2007. And it offers a few tips to the prime minister and the health secretary, Alan Johnson, on ways they can turn the tide of discontent. A swanky London hotel is the location of our meeting, and it is soon clear where Edwards is coming from. \"These places make me nervous,\" he says. And he is aghast to hear that three delicate flasks of mineral water cost \u00a311.50. Edwards works as an A&amp;E specialist in a hospital in England. He is in his 30s and comes from a family where public service and trade unionism are in the blood: \"I am an old-fashioned Labour supporter who believes in the values of the NHS that Nye Bevan created.\" He is also worried that his 258-page flailing of managers, targets and politicians (\"Tony Blair - icon of revolutionary socialist ideology or Thatcher's love child who acts as a tree for George Bush's poodle? You choose.\") might cost him his career if his identity gets out. He explains his motivation for writing the book: \"I voted for this government. I thought it was great when [Labour] brought Frank Dobson in [as health secretary] and he said, 'we are going to stop the private sector making money out of the NHS'. But they got rid of him and the moment [Alan] Milburn came in, Labour made even more deals with the private sector than the Tories.\" Independent sector treatment centres (ISTCs), where private companies are brought into the NHS to carry out conveyor-belt hip and cataract operations to slash NHS waiting lists, is a perfect example. \"ISTCs have taken all the easy cases, leaving the NHS with all the difficult ones, and are taking money out of the NHS and depriving surgeons-in-training of practice,\" he says. The book describes the chaos created by an influx of European Union doctors (it includes a description of Edwards trying to explain to a baffled Polish surgeon that a patient needs his appendix out - eventually he resorts to Pictionary). \"Our government's idea of gratitude to the thousands of Asian, Australasian and South African doctors who have kept our NHS running for the past 30 years is to say: 'Piss off. We are instead going to employ EU doctors who may or may not be able to speak English.' There isn't even a test to see if they know how to play Pictionary for shit's sake!\" Edwards is scathing about the new GP contract deal in which family doctors were able to sign away the responsibility for providing care during evenings and at weekends. \"We have an out-of-hours GP system that doesn't go out to visit and sends all its problems to A&amp;E,\" he says. NHS Direct, the nurse-run phone service, has also added to this burden. \"The nurses have to work to strict protocols and can't see patients face-to-face so they are cautious and say 'go to A&amp;E'.\" With more people using A&amp;E as a first port of call, Edwards believes that proposals for doing away with dozens of district general hospitals (DGHs) to rearrange care around regional centres of excellence and local polyclinics offering GPs, nurses, consultants and other disciplines are premature. \"The national gold-standard care for cancer, stroke and heart attacks talks about centres of excellence but that should not be at the expense of good DGHs. Anyway, you need to have proper community-based care in place before you think of getting rid of hospitals, and that hasn't happened yet,\" he insists. Edwards does admit that Blair and Gordon Brown have put a lot of money into the NHS, that it is better than it was under the Conservatives. He says that if Labour had not been elected in 1997 the NHS may by now have morphed into some kind of medical insurance system. But he feels that too many policies - such as patients being allowed a choice of five hospitals or the recent problems with the Medical Training Application System (Mtas) that failed to match junior doctors with training posts - were rushed through. \"There was too much sofa-style government done without thinking things through - it's the law of unintended consequences,\" says Edwards. \"Patients want choice: the choice of a good local GP and the choice of a good local hospital - not a [choice between] a local hospital or another one 50 miles away.\" He speaks of colleagues who have been so demoralised by the \"Mtas fiasco\" they are retraining as GPs or emigrating to Australia. \"I know of healthcare assistants - who are the bread and butter of the NHS; feeding, cleaning, taking blood and doing a lot of work that used to be lumped on junior doctors - having to quit because there is more money working in a high street clothes shop.\" But a major bugbear is the rule that 98% of A&amp;E patients must be seen and treated or admitted within four hours. \"The four-hour wait is a fantastic idea. Nobody should have to wait longer in A&amp;E, but it is skewing clinical priorities. Some people must stay in A&amp;E for more than four hours [to be observed, for example].\" The book gives examples of the fiddles used to ensure patients are dealt with appropriately within the target three hours, 59 minutes. They include curtaining-off corridors and redesignating them as \"admission wards\" (as soon as a patient is admitted the clock can be stopped), and patients being discharged on the computer before they have left A&amp;E. Vodka-ravaged teens If the unbending bureaucracy and over-zealous politicians were not enough, there are the patients - \"Oi, beautiful! Do you want to come home with me?\" is the vodka-ravaged teenage mockney's refrain to every passing nurse on New Year's Eve. Despite the book's complaints, Edwards pleads he is not \"a miserable git\" but is only reacting to the increases in alcohol-related accidents, injury and violence that take up too much of his time. He is in favour of huge price rises to keep kids off alcopops and for cannabis to be legalised so that its strength can be controlled and so that it becomes a source of tax revenue. While he hopes that the book is entertaining - there is a guide on being a good A&amp;E patient (rule one \"have an accident\", rule two \"have an emergency\") - he also wanted to show how much he loves the work and how it can make a big difference to people's lives. And it was written with an eye on New Labour, post-Tony Blair. \"Alan Johnson is having an NHS review, so I hope they step back. I mean, you are seeing nurses having a ballot on strike action because they are so fed up. I think the NHS needs an independent board, like the BBC has, so it can run its own affairs subject to some general targets. I just hope somebody reads the book and sees that there are problems, and there are ways to improve things.\" \u00b7 In Stitches: The Highs and Lows of Life as an A&amp;E Doctor is published tomorrow by Friday Books, RRP \u00a37.99.
