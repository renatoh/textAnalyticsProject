The celebrity chef described the drug as the \u201chospitality industry\u2019s dirty little secret\u201d and said that when he tested the toilets in his 31 restaurants around the world for traces of cocaine he discovered it in all but one. Ramsay was asked to dust the drug over a souffl\u00e9 at a charity dinner. \u201cWhen dessert arrived the couple came to me and said, \u2018Look, everyone on the table is happy you\u2019re here, but can you make a souffl\u00e9 like never before and combine icing sugar with coke and dust it?\u2019\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cI laughed it off but there was no way I was going to go anywhere near that. I dusted the sugar on top of the souffl\u00e9 and caramelised it purposely so they had no idea whether it was on or off. I set the souffl\u00e9 down. Didn\u2019t even say goodbye. I just left out the back door.\u201d Ramsay made the comments in a wide-ranging interview with the Radio Times to promote his new ITV documentary Gordon Ramsay on Cocaine, in which he explores the drug industry. The chef said he was inspired to make the programme after an incident in one of his restaurants last Christmas when a customer took a plate to the toilet so they could snort cocaine, and then handed it back to the waiter and asked them to change it for a clean plate. \u201cThis started the whole dilemma of how far this is going on and the pressure restaurants are up against from customers,\u201d Ramsay said. The 50-year-old has personal experiences of the repercussions of drug use \u2013 one of his head chefs, David Dempsey, died in 2003 after taking cocaine, and his brother is a long-term heroin addict who was busking in Portugal six months ago but has not been heard from since, according to Ramsay. The interview also includes criticism of fellow TV chef Jamie Oliver, and British workers, who Ramsay describes as \u201clazy\u201d. Furthermore, Ramsay reveals that he has met his father-in-law since he was released from prison. Chris Hutcheson was jailed for six months after hacking computers in Ramsay\u2019s company, but the chef said he had apologised and \u201cthere\u2019s a line in the sand now\u201d. However, Ramsay is less forgiving about Oliver, with whom he has had a long-running spat and has accused of hypocrisy over his campaign for a sugar tax in Britain. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well to spout off now about sugar tax and supermarkets. None of that was spoken about when he was label-slapping with Sainsbury\u2019s for 10 years,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cNo disrespect, but we\u2019re chefs, not politicians. When you breathe that stuff down the public\u2019s throat and say, \u2018I\u2019m leaving if we have Brexit\u2019, then, I\u2019m sorry, the door stands open. Stand for what you say.\u201d Ramsay said his feud with Oliver had been exacerbated by comments from Oliver that he has interpreted as a comparison between how many children they both have. Tana Ramsay had a miscarriage last year and Ramsay said he would not speak to Oliver until he apologised to his wife. The comments referred to by Ramsay were made in an interview with the Sun in which Oliver was quoted as saying: \u201cHe\u2019s got four kids and I\u2019ve got five kids and I don\u2019t want to be slagging off some kids\u2019 dad on telly. It\u2019s not nice.\u201d Others have interpreted these comments as a suggestion that parents should not argue in public. Oliver declined to comment. Ramsay\u2019s criticism of British workers was made in relation to Brexit, which he said could be a \u201cbig kick up the ass\u201d for the industry given the potential curbs on EU labour. He said: \u201cThat level of influx of multinational workers in this country has sort of confirmed how lazy as a nation we are \u2013 when individuals from across the seas are prepared to come and work twice as hard for less money. If anything, it\u2019s a big kick up the ass for the industry, and it\u2019s going to get back to the modern-day apprenticeship.\u201d The British Hospitality Association and the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers did not respond to requests for comment about drug use in the restaurant industry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
