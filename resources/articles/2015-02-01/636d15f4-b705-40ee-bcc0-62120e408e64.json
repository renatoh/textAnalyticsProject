If every woman in the land gets to try on one blasted glass slipper for a shot at Prince Charming\u2019s hand in marriage, why does the wicked, widowed stepmother never have a go? Is she too old? Too ugly? Too imperfectly coiffed? None is an accusation you could fairly level against Cate Blanchett\u2019s splendid Lady Tremaine. A tart-tongued beauty with a traffic-stopping wardrobe inherited from the personal archives of Edith Head \u2013 not to mention an evident knack for hosting a mean poker party \u2013 she\u2019s plainly the biggest catch in the entire kingdom. Blanchett is certainly the best thing in Kenneth Branagh\u2019s perky, pretty, lavender-scented cupcake of a fairytale adaptation \u2013 the first in what looks to be a series of live-action Disney updates of their own animated classics. (Beauty and the Beast, starring Emma Watson as Belle, is already in the works.) Perhaps \u201cupdate\u201d isn\u2019t the word, given that its go-getting villain is the only element of this irony-free interpretation that feels remotely revisionist: cleverly played by Blanchett as a life-hardened femme fatale rather than an irrational harridan, this sexed-up stepmum is just a woman trying to get ahead in what is still rigidly, for all its talk of happy endings, a man\u2019s world. If I were Richard Madden\u2019s fetching, marriage-minded monarch, loins astir beneath unfeasibly tight breeches, I wouldn\u2019t look any further. The camera, squinting as it is through a veritable sandstorm of glitter, hardly does. Alas, its focus does occasionally drift to Cinderella herself, winsomely embodied by Downton Abbey\u2019s Lily James, but rather wanly conceived in Chris Weitz\u2019s script. One might have expected the co-creator of American Pie to give Cinders a little more spunk, so to speak, but she\u2019s relentlessly ingenuous, spouting her late mother\u2019s Pollyanna-ish mantra \u2013 \u201cHave courage and be kind\u201d \u2013 at every given opportunity, and plenty of unpresented ones besides. Not that Charles Perrault\u2019s woebegone servant girl has ever been the most courageous heroine in the fairytale library: she\u2019s not exactly exhibiting nerves of steel when she flees the palace ball at the stroke of midnight, fearful that her besotted prince might be irretrievably turned off by the sight of her in daywear. Branagh and Weitz stick lovingly to the legend throughout; and while it might have been nice to see the new-model Cinderella follow Frozen\u2019s progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film\u2019s naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm. Branagh\u2019s recent shift into captaining shiny studio showboats (Thor, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit) isn\u2019t an expected career development, but it\u2019s not an unwelcome one either. The slumming Shakespearean brings a certain literate twinkle to proceedings, and with wittily excessive assistance from master designers Sandy Powell and Dante Ferretti, he boasts a keener sense of spectacle than many a tentpole journeyman. There are palatial set pieces here \u2013 a choreographed troupe of slate-suited fencers, a whirling, swirling royal waltz in Easter-egg hues \u2013 that conjure admittedly fleeting recollections of Branagh\u2019s epic, eccentric vision of Hamlet. One wonders what he could do with other, gutsier Disney princesses, particularly with the brilliant Blanchett to keep them on their oh-so-dainty toes. \u2022 Comments have been reopened to time with this film\u2019s Australian release"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
