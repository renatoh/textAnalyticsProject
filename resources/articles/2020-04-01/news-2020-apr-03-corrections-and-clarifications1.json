The article was at the time not able to clarify that a death certificate recorded her cause of death as Covid-19. This has now been confirmed by both the family and in a statement on behalf of the Berkshire coroner\u2019s office. We are pleased to clarify this matter and apologise to the family for any confusion and distress caused. Since the article was published, statistics were this week released by the Office for National Statistics, which include all deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on a death certificate, whereas previous government figures counted only those deaths where the patient had a positive test result. Ms Middleton\u2019s case should therefore be in ONS figures for coronavirus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
