The problem is that this sickly concoction is often overcooked. I've Got Your Number, Son has a nice line in Loretta Lynn lyrical sass, but it's drenched in horns and backing harmonies \u2013 as elsewhere, there's simply so much going on that it chips away at any potential charm. But when they go easy on the twee, and take their feet off the reverb pedal, there's more to admire. London, a simple piano ballad, and Shadow of Love, play out the album with melancholic restraint. It seems a spoonful of medicine helps the sugar go down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
