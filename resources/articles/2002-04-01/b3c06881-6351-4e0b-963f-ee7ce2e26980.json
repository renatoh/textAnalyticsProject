It certainly has all the necessaries: restless mother who bakes her own bread, kids with names like Coco and Lily, well-meaning but dull husband, gorgeous best friend with successful modelling career and cool, hunky boyfriend. All that's missing, you might think, is the obligatory Day-Glo cover and exclamatory quote from Cosmo. Well, you'd be wrong. It took me about four pages of this fantastically subtle, absorbing and insightful novel to realise that although the familiar ingredients are there, something much more interesting is going on. It's not that Hadley's basic storyline is especially original. Thirtyish Clare believes herself happy juggling marriage with motherhood and part-time (or half-hearted) academic career. Then her oldest friend bowls up with yet another new man. Except that this one turns out to have slept with Clare, long ago, at a teenage party - and secretly contacts her to say that he'd like to do it again. Though guilty, tempted Clare seems to be the central character, we delve just as satisfyingly into the lives of her extended family: her damaged and difficult sister; her sensitive, displaced younger brother; her parents, who have divorced and remarried a zillion times in bids to rediscover their younger, unfettered sexual selves. It's this simultaneous breadth and depth that catapults the book into the premier league. Not only is Hadley brave enough to extend the story beyond Clare's marriage and adultery, she does so in such a mysteriously adept way. Each character only comes into full focus for a matter of pages before receding into the background again, yet the whole continues to feel smooth and real and satisfying. How does she do it? Well, for a start, this is prose to die for. Without resorting to obvious lyricism or stylistic tricks, Hadley writes readable, approachable phrases that suck you in with the power of their psychological insight. When the situation pushes Clare to leave her husband and kids, she alternates \"between passionate, desperate love for the children, and then a sort of astonishment that, after all, when she spent time with them it was all absorbed in the old, ordinary tedious things: eating, cleaning up, squabbles\". One of the best, most unerringly magical things fiction can do is lay your life there on the page in front of you. That quick, embarrassing flush of recognition is, for me, what keeping company with a book is really all about. There are plenty of writers honest, witty and perceptive enough to capture these small, quotidian details, but there are very few who can make proper, pungent and serious literature out of them. Hadley's book is a match for almost any current critically lauded novel you could name. In fact, you have to wonder whether, if she was male and American and the book was twice as heavy, she wouldn't have the whole of the chattering classes falling at her feet. This writer is a rare and startling gem; she deserves to be read. Julie Myerson's most recent novel is Laura Blundy (Fourth Estate)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
