More fool them. A month's-worth of rain fell in the first two weeks of July. More is sure to come. Here, then, are a few survival tips for camping in the rain. Before you go \"Check your tent to make sure that it's got a properly weatherproof outer layer and ground sheet,\" says Sophie Dawson, who has just returned from a (very wet) foray to Wales, where she was researching next year's edition of Cool Camping. Invest in a second groundsheet, which can go under the tent for added protection. Pack extra blankets to put under sleeping mats for further insulation against damp. Pitch carefully Head for higher ground \u2014 don't pitch in water-loving dips and hollows, and don't be seduced by riversides. If you have to pitch on a slope, make sure the doorway points towards lower ground, so your tent doesn't fill with water. Don't pitch too far from the toilets: \"You'll spend your entire time trekking to and from them, getting wetter and wetter and more and more miserable,\" says one seasoned camper. Create a storage spot Find a protected spot to stow your gear while you wrestle with the canvas. If you have a car, that's helpful. A collapsible gazebo is good \u2013 especially as you can later cook under it. When you put up your tent make sure the waterproof outer layer is pulled really taut, as far from the inner walls as possible. Take extra tent pegs. Ventilate Hours in a tent leads to breath condensing on the walls \u2013 and then you'll be wet regardless. Quarantine wet things Resealable plastic bags and bin liners are invaluable for storing wet clothes in, or keeping kindling dry. Try to take anoraks and such off before you get back into the tent - a tent with a porch is good for this. Always keep a dry change of clothes (some campsites have drying rooms and laundries). Institute a no-shoes-inside tent rule, or keep inside-only flip-flops by the front door. Finally \u2013 all those who grew up reading Swallows and Amazons know this one \u2013 make sure nothing touches the inside walls, or water will start leaking through. Pack entertainment You're going to need it. Take books, cards, word games, crayons, paints, even a laptop or portable DVD player \u2013 you can charge these at nearby pubs, then snuggle down to hours of film-watching. Don't take a dog (or a baby) Dogs may try to burrow out of the tent, tearing the groundsheet, and will track mud everywhere. If you do take small children, get a big tent \u2013 imagine a small space covered in food droppings, nappies, stove, dirty dishes, wet gear . . . Oh, and try to have fun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
