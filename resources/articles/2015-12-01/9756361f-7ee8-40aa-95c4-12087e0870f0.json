Klopp said he was not looking to sign a No1 despite reports that claimed otherwise. Mignolet, who signed for Liverpool from Sunderland in June 2013 for \u00a39m on a five-year deal, would see his \u00a360,000 a-week salary increased if he agrees a new contract. Klopp claimed before Wednesday\u2019s Capital One Cup quarter-final at Southampton that Liverpool are not in the market for a goalkeeper after being linked with Stoke City\u2019s Jack Butland and the Belgium Under-21 Guillaume Hubert. \u201cIt is a good moment to talk about the goalkeepers at Liverpool,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cI am absolutely satisfied with our goalkeeping situation. I am sorry to kill your stories about goalkeepers. We are not looking for another goalkeeper. We have enough high-quality goalkeepers, I\u2019ve had a lot of goalkeepers over the last few years and Simon Mignolet is one of the smartest I have ever had. \u201cHe is completely open and he\u2019s young enough to develop, to improve. He\u2019s not had the easiest situation before I came here, but since I have been here there has been nothing to criticise, absolutely nothing.\u201d The Liverpool\u2019s No2 Adam Bogdan, who played in the previous round at home to Bournemouth, may get a start at Southampton. Klopp also moved to clarify his comments that Daniel Sturridge needed to understand the difference between \u201cserious pain and what is only pain\u201d. Klopp\u2019s words suggested he believed Sturridge may not be pushing himself to play when suffering from a minor injury but Klopp said: \u201cMaybe it was my fault because of the language. I thought I said: \u2018We all had to learn.\u2019 That is it. That is what we have to do. With his injury history it is not easy. If you have 20 injuries you cannot treat it like the first. All of us are going to be influenced by the experience we have. If you have more injuries then you have more doubt. \u201cThe situation about Daniel it is not his quality, it is his history. We try to do it together, no one is alone at Melwood [training base] \u2013 we all do it together.\u201d When asked what Sturridge had said to Klopp following those comments the manager said: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything about when I speak to the players and what they tell me. There will be nothing ever. There is nothing to say about this, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d Sturridge, who had been suffering from a knee injury, and the captain, Jordan Henderson, who broke a foot in mid-September, had no adverse reactions after second-half substitute appearances in Sunday\u2019s 1-0 win over Swansea City. Both will travel to Southampton. \u201cHenderson and Sturridge will be in the squad,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cWe have these two options. We can\u2019t ignore that there could be extra-time. 120 minutes would be too much [for Henderson and Sturridge].\u201d Philippe Coutinho may also be available following a hamstring injury. \u201cHe could be close, but we need to check and double check the situation,\u201d Klopp said. Since taking over Liverpool have been defeated only once in 10 games under Klopp yet the German showed his perfectionism when considering whether this constituted a good start. \u201cSometimes I would like to change my personality but I can\u2019t forget this fucking loss against Crystal Palace, if we won this then I would say OK,\u201d he said of the 2-1 defeat at Anfield last month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
