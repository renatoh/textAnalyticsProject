The Department of Defence, which is leading the prosecution through a controversial and much-criticised process of military commissions, issued 169 charges against the men that include conspiracy, murder in violation of the law or war, attacking civilians, destruction of property and terrorism. Appended to the full list of the charges published on the Pentagon's website today were the names of all 2,973 victims of the outrage. Prosecutors accused the men of collectively organising a \"long-term, highly sophisticated plan to attack the United States\". The highest profile of the six, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, is alleged to have been the mastermind of 9/11 who, by his own words, was responsible \"from A to Z\". The announcement of 9/11 charges brings to a head the simmering conflict over the legal treatment of the 275 detainees remaining in Guantanamo, and particularly the 15 so-called \"high-value\" suspected terrorists held there since September 2006. Lawyers working on behalf of detainees have long criticised the commissions process \u2014 in which even the judges are military personnel \u2014 as unfair, unduly secret and against the US constitutional right to habeus corpus. There is also the question of interrogation techniques used to extract confessions from the six. Last week the director of the CIA, Michael Hayden, admitted publicly for the first time that Mohammed had been waterboarded \u2014 that is subjected to simulated drowning in a technique widely seen as torture. Brigadier General Thomas Hartmann, the legal adviser to the system of military tribunals who announced the charges, said that the six al-Qaida suspects would be tried together and efforts would be made to keep the proceedings as open as possible. \"There will be no secret trials. We are gong to give them rights that are virtually identical to our military members,\" he said. But huge doubts remain over key areas of how the prosecution would work within the military system set up for Guantanamo's so-called \"enemy combatants\" \u2014 a rubric devised by the Bush administration to strip the detainees of rights normally extended under the Geneva conventions. Though Hartmann said the trial would be largely open, it is not known how much of the evidence against them will be shown to the six defendants or their lawyers. According to the British lawyer Clive Stafford Smith who works with Guantanamo detainees, only one of the six men charged today has had access to a lawyer in recent months. Hartmann said today that it would be up to the military judge in charge of the trial to decide whether any of the information derived from his waterboarding would be admissible. At least two of the other six have also been put through \"enhanced interrogation\" techniques that include sleep deprivation and prolonged questioning for up to 20 hours at a time. All these concerns will be amplified dramatically by the decision to press for capital punishment, which is certain to arouse European opposition on those grounds alone. It also presents the Pentagon with deep logistical problems, as there is currently only one lawyer qualified to prosecute a death penalty case within its military commissions team. Stafford Smith said the move was counter-productive, as it played to the terrorists' hands. \"They want to be martyrs. If we execute them, we fulfill their greatest wish. This is a long process of them getting what they want, and that makes us all less safe,\" he told the Guardian. In addition to Mohammed, the other five listed on the charge sheet are all alleged to have participated in the 9/11 plot. Their roles included the would-be 20th hijacker, Mohammed al-Qahtani, as well as co-ordinators between the 19 hijackers and al-Qaida operatives, and funders of the plot. The next stage in the process will be for the charges to be reviewed by a supervising judge, Susan Crawford. She will have to decide whether to allow the prosecution to seek the death penalty. The charges come at a highly sensitive time in the long-standing tussle over the military commissions. The Supreme Court heard arguments about the legality of the system last December in which opponents argued that the removal of habeus corpus from detainees was unconstitutional. The court, which is expected to give its ruling in the next few weeks, has already struck down the military tribunals in 2006. But the Bush administration replied by passing legislation through Congress to legitimise the system. The Guantanamo six Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Alleged number three in al-Qaida and the self-described mastermind of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. Last March he told a closed hearing in Guant\u00e1namo that he was responsible for 9/11 \"from A to Z\". Born in Kuwait in 1965, he is the uncle of Ramzi Yousef, who orchestrated the earlier attack on the World Trade Centre in 1993 Ramzi bin al-Shibh Suspected intermediary between hijackers and al-Qaida leaders. Shared a flat in Hamburg with Mohamed Atta, the chief hijacker. Had tried to enter US to join pilot school, but gave up after several attempts and it is claimed then focused on funding and coordinating the other hijackers Mohammed al-Qahtani Alleged 20th hijacker. The Saudi was stopped trying to enter the US shortly before 9/11. Details have emerged of harsh interrogation methods used against him, including questioning sessions that lasted 20 hours without a break Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali, known as Ammar al-Baluchi Nephew and alleged right-hand man of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Born in Pakistan, he is said to have worked with his uncle on the 9/11 plot, and was arrested in April 2003 Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi Said to have worked alongside al-Baluchi coordinating and funding hijackers. He has told a military tribunal he was in contact with four hijackers but had no knowledge of the attacks before they happened Walid bin Attash Alleged to have chosen and trained some of the hijackers. According to the Pentagon, he also told a closed military tribunal that he was the mastermind of the attack on the USS Cole in 2000, in which 17 US sailors died, and helped plan the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 213"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
