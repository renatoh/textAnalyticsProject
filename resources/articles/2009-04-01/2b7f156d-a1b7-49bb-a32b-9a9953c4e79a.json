Maybe it is one of the 12 steps, a sort of recompense for bad behaviour towards women. Some of you, I realise \u2013 mostly those of you with jobs or taste \u2013 will have no idea what I am talking about, but finding myself at liberty in the daylight hours, I occasionally watch Loose Women. It reminds me of my youth. At the age of 15, you see, I had a holiday job in a small clothing factory in Salford. I was usually stationed with the guys in the cutting-room, performing vital tasks like going out for their sausage sandwiches and retuning the radio when Jimmy Young came on, but a couple of times a day they would despatch me on an errand to the exclusively female province of the sewing machine room. Banter ensued, invariably centred on the fact that the possessor of a penis \u2013 a young and inexperienced one at that \u2013 had entered the sanctum. \"Have you got something for me?\" a conversation might start, invariably accompanied by knowing giggles from adjacent machinists. Because I was presenting them with a parcel of clothing parts to be sewn, the opportunities for innuendo were many, and rarely spurned. Robin Askwith rather than Oscar Wilde was the house style. \"Is it a big package?\" was the kind of zinger that would more or less halt production. And this is exactly what Loose Women is like. So imagine my surprise when into the coven last week strode Gazza. The former England star is on some sort of charm offensive at present, guesting on Match Of The Day 2 last night, and on Saturday's Soccer AM on Sky. He does not appear to be plugging anything either, unless it is Tony Adams' Sporting Chance clinic which, fingers crossed, may have given Gazza a new lease on life. He certainly coped well enough with the single entendres flying round the Loose Women cacklefest. He was sitting in the green room with Su Pollard \u2013 a fairly tough gig in itself \u2013 as host Jackie Brambles launched the show with a spurious Little Shop of Horrors reference: \"And speaking of man- eating plants, here's a lady who puts a Venus fly-trap to shame, Denise Welch,\" she announced, and as the uproarious laughter subsided, \"now for a lady whose garden has seen its fair share of weeds, but these days it's used to a good trowelling, it's Jane McDonald.\" This segued into a bit about fun fairs, where McDonald was asked if she was a fan. \"Well, I've been on a Big One a few times,\" countered the raconteur and cruise ship songstress. By the way, if you have this kind of rapier-like wit and lament the passing of the Algonquin round table, you could try your repartee out on the girls themselves. They are running a competition to find the new face of Loose Women for 2009, with the winner getting to sit with the panel (I almost wrote \"sit on the panel\" which in some circumstances would be fine, but probably not in this context) through five shows. \"So if you think you're loose enough, get in there,\" said Jackie. \"And remember, it's an extremely popular, award-winning show.\" It is true. They got a gong from the Television and Radio Industries Club. Mind you, they give out awards for all sorts of things these days. There is a shop at the bottom of Oxford Street advertising \"award-winning Cornish pasties\" and I have emailed them through their website several times asking exactly what award their pasties have won (\"Best Use of Carrots in a Pastry-Based Context\" perhaps, something like that?), so far without reply. Gazza's performance on LW, though not exactly award-winning, was encouraging. Last time we saw him on TV, in the documentary Surviving Gazza, he was a chilling collection of tics and twitches, prey to bizarre drunken paranoid fantasies. Now he was well enough to joke about his obsessive-compulsive disorder, which I gathered was being treated through cognitive behavioural therapy. Gazza messed up the arrangement of coffee mugs on the desk, saying: \"Before, I could not have done that. But now it doesn't really bother us.\" Then he waited a beat before making a funny grimacing face to the camera, and putting them back again. He was asked about Shearer's return to Tyneside. \"It's fantastic,\" he said, \"We played in the England team together, and here he is, manager of Newcastle. And here I am, on Loose Women.\" It is not always easy to make out what Gazza is saying, but that can probably be explained by past alcohol abuse, and the fact he talks quite quickly in a fairly impenetrable Geordie accent, so it may be a while before he is delivering the Reith Lecture. He has been sober for four months, he told the Loose Women, training in the morning, then \"I go to my mam's for me rice or pasta, and watch youse lot.\" Which is odd because when I watch, I find I quite fancy a drink. \"Don't go anywhere, because after the break it's Su Pollard,\" said Jackie. I went somewhere."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
