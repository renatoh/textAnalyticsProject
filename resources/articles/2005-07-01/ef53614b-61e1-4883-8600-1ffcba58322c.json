Rome", "bodyText": "Why? Probably because I was just the right age to lose my heart there. I was 19 and meant to be teaching English in my gap year. But all the arrangements were completely chaotic so I didn't teach much English at all. Instead, I remember riding around on a Vespa with no helmet - those were the days - and staying somewhere where I seemed to be constantly surrounded by passionate Italian girls. The best thing? The food. This is a city with its own cuisine, where over the centuries even its wealthy inhabitants came to realise that the food of its slums was often better than Tuscan steaks. Eating is not such a romantic thing in Rome - it has fantastic restaurants with really bright lights so you can see the food. My ideal day: I would stay in the Trastevere quarter, which is surrounded by churches. If the bell ringing from dawn did not ensure I was up early it would be the sound of Rome's motorists tooting on their horns. I'd grab a tiny breakfast - a cappuccino with a sugared cornetto croissant - then cross the Tiberto to go to the markets. I would also seek out the food market for some amazing vegetables to have with my lunch, which I would prepare myself. After a siesta, I would wander to the Galleria Doria Pamphili art gallery set in a glorious old palace and later dine in one of Trastevere's tiny restaurants. My advice: Don't drive, consider staying in Trastevere and avoid August when the city practically closes down. Getting there: EasyJet (easyjet.com) flies Gatwick-Rome from around \u00a3115pp return. Where was your best holiday? I love the annual family holidays in Cornwall we take every year. I am giving my kids the same kind of holidays I took when I was small. Where do you want to go next? Naples. My next book is set there and I need to go back to soak up the atmosphere. What do you never travel without? Reliable restaurant recommendations. \u00b7 Anthony Capella's The Food Of Love (TimeWarner, \u00a36.99) is currently being made into a film by Warner Bros."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
