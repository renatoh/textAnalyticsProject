In 2010, members of the Consumer Goods Forum, including some of the world\u2019s biggest consumer brands, pledged to eliminate deforestation by 2020, through the sustainable sourcing of four commodities most linked to forest destruction: soya, palm oil, paper and pulp, and cattle. But analysis by Greenpeace International suggests that by the start of 2020, an estimated 50m hectares (123m acres) of forest are likely to have been destroyed in the growing demand for and consumption of agricultural products, in the 10 years since those promises were made. Its report, Countdown to Extinction, said that since 2010, the area planted with soya in Brazil has increased by 45% and palm oil production in Indonesia has risen by 75%. The environmental group accused major brands of failing to meet their commitments and warned that the current situation was \u201cbleak\u201d, advising them to evolve in order to \u201cprevent climate and ecological breakdown\u201d. Deforestation releases greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change and destroy important habitat, threatening species with extinction. Greenpeace says it wrote to more than 50 traders, retailers, producers and consumer companies early in 2019 asking them to demonstrate progress towards deforestation by disclosing their commodity suppliers. Only a handful replied and all of those that did disclose the requested information source products from traders or producers involved in forest destruction, they said. None of the 50 demonstrated \u201cmeaningful\u201d action to end deforestation, the campaigners said, based on assessing their policies and publicly available supply chain information. The companies that responded could not provide details on how much soya they were using for animal feed, let alone where it was sourced from, the campaigners said. Soya is the second most significant driver of global deforestation and 90% of soya produced globally is used for animal feed, the report found. Anna Jones, global campaign lead for forests at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cThese companies are destroying our children\u2019s future by driving us towards climate and ecological collapse. \u201cThey\u2019ve wasted a decade on half-measures and in that time vast areas of the natural world have been destroyed. \u201cThey should be in crisis talks right now, but they\u2019re still trying to grow demand for products that will drive forest destruction even further.\u201d She added: \u201cOur message to companies is simple: evolve your business to prevent climate and ecological breakdown.\u201d About 80% of global deforestation is caused by agricultural production, which is also the leading cause of habitat destruction, the group said. Agricultural consumption, and therefore production, is forecast to rise globally. Meat consumption is set to rise by 76% according to some estimates. Soya production is also predicted to soar by almost 45% and palm oil by nearly 60%, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The campaigners said the onus is on brands that use commodities such as beef, palm oil and soya, to show their supply chains are free from deforestation. Richard George, head of forests at Greenpeace UK said: \u201cAny company using soya needs to be committed to eliminating deforestation and habitat destruction. They need to be aware of where their products come from. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking that 10 years after these companies committed to cutting deforestation, they don\u2019t know how much soya they are using. We are in the middle of a climate crisis. That\u2019s not ok.\u201d The report, published as chief executives from global brands gathered in Vancouver for the Consumer Goods Forum global summit, said that preventing climate and ecological breakdown will require \u201ctransformative changes\u201d to the way forests are managed and agricultural commodities are produced, and \u201cdramatic reductions\u201d in meat and dairy consumption. \u201cWe are experiencing a climate and ecological emergency,\u201d the report said. \u201cCompanies that are unwilling or unable to do what is needed to fit the global commodity trade and keep forest destroyers out of their supply chains must instead avoid high-risk commodities entirely.\u201d In October last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recognised that reforming the food system to ensure the protection of forests is a vital part of the flight against the climate emergency. And in May, the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem systems warned of an unprecedented decline in nature, accelerating extinction rates and called for \u201ctransformative changes\u201d to restore and protect nature. The Consumer Goods Forum said that while its members purchase only a \u201csmall fraction\u201d of the commodities grown in tropical forests, they are playing an \u201cimportant role\u201d in addressing the issues. These include sharing best practices on the sourcing of commodities, using new technology to increase transparency in supply chains, and co-founding the Tropical Forest Alliance with the US government to reduce deforestation. In a statement, the CGF said: \u201cToday, the CGF\u2019s members have moved substantially closer to our goal of 100% sustainable sourcing of the four commodity groups. But over the last nine years we have also learned that the forces driving deforestation are more complex than almost any stakeholder realised in 2010.\u201d The CGF now believes that sourcing certified sustainable commodities is not sufficient to eliminate deforestation, and so has been working over the past 18 months with external stakeholders to develop a more effective strategy, it said. Details of the strategy, which will be discussed at this week\u2019s global summit, will be shared during UN climate week in September, as planned, it said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
