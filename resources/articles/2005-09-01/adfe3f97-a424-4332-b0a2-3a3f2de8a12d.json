Since the last one, whispery Bury man Guy Garvey has had a most unlikely romance with Radio 1 ladette Edith Bowman, which seems to have instilled a bit of backbone. His heart, perennially at war with his head, has toughened up and we now find him assertive, and ready to throttle choruses. The single Forget Myself provides a storming one, with all hands (horns, strings, the lot) on deck, bawling: \"No, I know I won't forget you, but I'll forget myself.\" In fact, Leaders of the Free World's chief appeal, other than Garvey's stompiness, is its choruses. Previously, Elbow could spin out one of their reticent tunes for minutes without ever bothering with one. This record, though, retains Elbow's best qualities - embittered romanticism and pretty, twisty melodies - while infusing them with hooks galore.
