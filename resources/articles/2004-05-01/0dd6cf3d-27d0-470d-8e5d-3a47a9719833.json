In the next five weeks the top players in Europe will be competing for a total of \u00a311.5m, with this week's Deutsche Bank event worth \u00a32m alone. The stretch, which also includes the Volvo PGA Championship next week, the Wales Open and the Diageo event, concludes with the US Open, by which time there should be a far clearer idea of what the Ryder Cup team will be. It is also possible that Vijay Singh will have toppled Tiger Woods from the world No1 position he has held for so many weeks. It will depend, of course, on the relative performances of the two players but Singh, by far the busier performer, will be in a position to gain more points than the American. The Fijian, for instance, is playing next week at Wentworth, another strong field with masses of world-ranking points. Woods, by contrast, is resting and will play in only one event, Jack Nicklaus's tournament, The Memorial, before the US Open at Shinnecock Hills, in New York. Woods can barely find a fairway off the tee lately and is the only player in the world's top five who, in terms of ranking points, is doing worse this season than last. That makes him vulnerable and if Singh performs with distinction over the next month it will be all to play for at Shinnecock. Els, third in the world, used to be in awe of Woods and he still finds it impossible to understand how the American does what he does. Asked yesterday if he thought Woods was \"having fun\" on the golf course, he said: \"I wouldn't say that. He's getting the ball round, he's scoring and it just shows you the character of Tiger. \"He's struggling with his swing, with his ball control and yet he finished only one off the lead last week and two the previous week. So, playing like that and still managing to get himself into contention, that's impressive, that's playing very well in fact.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
