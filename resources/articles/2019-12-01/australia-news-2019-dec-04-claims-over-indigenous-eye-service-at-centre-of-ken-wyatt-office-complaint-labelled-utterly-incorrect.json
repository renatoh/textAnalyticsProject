In a statement released on Wednesday, the Australian Society of Ophthalmologists said it was \u201cextremely proud\u201d to be associated with the Indigenous and Remote Eye Health Service (Iris), which was treating blinding eye disease among the most disadvantaged populations in Australia. Wyatt has also defended the $2.2m contract, which was awarded without a tender process to an organisation linked to the former Liberal candidate Bill Glasson. The contract became the subject of an internal complaint, according to Tuesday\u2019s report in the Sydney Morning Herald. Dr Ashish Agar, vice-president of the ASO, said the organisation asked eye surgeons to take time away from their city practice to operate on Indigenous Australians in the remotest locations. \u201cIt is hard work, difficult surgery on complex cataracts, and most city surgeons are not willing to commit to such time in these difficult conditions,\u201d Agar said. He said it was \u201cutterly incorrect\u201d for the report to state that the $4,000 fee was double the going rate. He said that fee referred to the whole service provided, including pre-operative clinic and post-operative care, consumables and operative eye fluids, intra-ocular lens implant, medical and nursing team and a concessional surgeon fee. The figure also covered the cost of air transport for people and equipment, staff accommodation and meals for up to a week, a charter plane for very remote locations or other transport to pick up Indigenous patients from remote settlements and bring them into town, and a team trained in cultural sensitivity onsite up to a week before surgery to locate, prepare and care for patients. \u201cBy comparison, the NSW government statewide cost price for cataract surgery used in NSW public hospital budgets is $4,823.\u201d Agar said. The president of the ASO, Peter Sumich, also defended the directors of Iris, Bill Glasson and Kerry Gallagher. Glasson, who ran as the Liberal candidate against Kevin Rudd at the 2013 federal election, was a director of Iris between 2016 and 2019, along with Gallagher, a lobbyist. \u201cDr Bill Glasson AO is a respected peer leader and has for decades performed cataract surgery from Longreach to Birdsville and in other Indigenous communities. His reputation is totally beyond reproach,\u201d Sumich said. \u201cMr Kerry Gallagher, AM likewise, is a distinguished war veteran who has dedicated much of his time to running Iris at very little personal benefit. Dragging these two upstanding Australians into what is essentially a politicised employment dispute within Minister Wyatt\u2019s office is deplorable,\u201d Sumich said. The ASO said the Iris program was started in 2009 by the Rudd Labor government and had been supported by both sides of politics since then."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
