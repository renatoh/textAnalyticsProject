The 30-second clip of Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone will be screened at the Superbowl XXXV baseball tournament in Florida on January 28. A spokesman for an unofficial Harry Potter website says, \"There are some of the more hardcore fans who are actually flying over to the game to see the trailer. It sounds absurd, but if you're a fan of Potter, that's not so different from being a fan of sport and flying to Sydney to see the Olympics.\" The half-minute advert is billed to join short promotions for other forthcoming blockbusters including The Lord Of The Rings, Pearl Harbour, The Mummy Returns And Hannibal. \u0095 Screen legend Sir John Mills has spoken about the reasons why he never pursued an acting career in Hollywood. The 92-year-old star says it was down to Noel Coward's advice that he should reject the major roles which would have meant working in America. \"I turned down very big, lucrative film contracts, because it meant leaving England and I just didn't want to,\" Mills told reporters. \"When I was 20, I was offered a huge contract with Twentieth Century Fox and Noel Coward took me for dinner and spent three hours persuading me it wasn't a wise thing. He said 'You're a very good actor, but you will become a sort of Johnny Garfield or a Jimmy Cagney - a personality. You'll never learn your trade there.' I'm delighted that I did that.\" \u0095 Chris O'Donnell has confirmed that he will not be reprising his role as Robin when the next Batman adventures swing into action. O'Donnell, currently to be seen in the mountain climbing drama, Vertical Limit, says he has \"paid his dues\" as the caped crusader's right hand man. \u0095 British actress Kate Winslet's next film project will be her first as a producer according to reports today. The Quills star is set to appear in and produce an adaptation of Emile Zola's Therese Raquin - a grisly tale of crime and passion among the lower classes of Paris at the end of the 19th century. \u0095 Mel Gibson has issued a grovelling apology to director Wim Wenders And U2's Bono after calling their film The Million Dollar Hotel as \"boring as a dog's a**\" and the star of the forthcoming What Women Want admits that the singer, who co-wrote the movie's screenplay, has every right to be furious. Gibson says, \"I take it all back. I did say that and it was unfortunate because it was in Australia after about 6,000 interviews. I had jet lag and someone asked a dumb question. Being perverse in nature and partially self-destructive, it just kind of spewed out and I didn't take into account the other people who worked very hard and did a great job.\" Gibson also denies reports that he tried to stop the release of the movie. \"It would be counter-productive for me not to release it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
