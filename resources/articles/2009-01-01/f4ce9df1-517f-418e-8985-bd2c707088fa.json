Yet they came close to being rewarded with the result neither of them wanted. Only the winner from Dutch striker Marvin Emnes, a second-half replacement, nine minutes from time earned victory for Gareth Southgate's strugglers and averted the dreaded replay. There were a total of eight changes from the teams fielded by the Middlesbrough manager and Mick McCarthy last time out, the latter bringing in five new players from the side who had drawn at Bristol City last week. That was recognition of Wolves' status as Championship leaders \u2014 they are seven points ahead of third place \u2014 while Southgate's side, depleted because of suspension and injury, are in the bottom three of the Premier League and now have only two wins in their past 13 games, both in this competition. McCarthy, though, nearly rued fielding the one senior player to whom he had not given the day off. Chris Iwelumo is a robust leader of the Wolves line who is built for the rustic challenges of the second tier of English football, so his manager will be relieved that the second-half ankle injury he suffered should allow him to play on Tuesday against promotion rivals Reading. \"He'll be OK,\" McCarthy said, before denying that this defeat was a relief in allowing the league to be focused on, adding: \"We wanted to win the game. We tried to win the game.\" The match, in truth, was hardly a particularly warming offering on a chilly Black Country afternoon The visitors began with a stutter, requiring 12 minutes to threaten Wayne Hennessey's goal. Afonso Alves discovered a route through the home defence, but his shot was too straight. Southgate's team were playing to constant taunts about relegation and they do appear in danger. Lack of confidence, of course, is always a defining problem, and here it was embodied by Adam Johnson, who contrived to miss three chances. It took the intervention of Tuncay and Alves for the opener finally to arrive. The Turkey midfielder produced a glorious reverse pass while spinning through 180 degrees. Alves' finish over Hennessey was equally delightful. This meant the second half would start with the game apparently fizzling out. Yet there was Sam Vokes to outleap the visiting defence and equalise with a header. The draw was back on. Instead, Emnes finished off the post to prevent the replay and give Southgate the boost of victory \"It was a very young side today and a lot of people expected us to get turned over,\" Southgate said, before offering a view on his side's current form. 'What's pleasing is we're still creating loads of chances.\" They will need to continue finishing them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
