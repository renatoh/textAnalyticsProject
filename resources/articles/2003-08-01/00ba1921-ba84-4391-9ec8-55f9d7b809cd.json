But now here he is, suddenly 18, and off to study biochemistry at Sheffield University. It's daunting when your child first heads off to university. Most likely, the longest they will have been away from home without you before will have been when they spent 10 days in the Dordogne on that French exchange. This is different. Though they will be back again in the holidays, this is really their first tentative step towards leaving home. It can be tempting to keep them tethered to your apron strings, calling them every day to check up on what they're eating, whether they're doing their homework, and whether they're wearing their coat. Chances are, they aren't eating properly. Most probably, they are surviving on a diet of Crunchy Nut Cornflakes, late-night kebabs and alcopops. This is a rites-of-passage moment, and you should not be too concerned about them returning home with rickets. Nevertheless, it's worth doing a few things to help to ward off scurvy. When you first deliver your beloved child to their student digs, sneak in some fresh fruit and vegetables and some long-life items, such as cans of baked beans. Arm them with a simple cookery book and some utensils, so they can have a little fun dabbling in the culinary world. If they have any favourite dishes at home, perhaps give them a mini-lesson in the weeks before they leave. It's also a kind gesture to leave them with a good stock of cakes and biscuits, for freshers' week guests. Are they doing their homework? Perhaps. It's also pretty darned unlikely that they're wearing their coat. They're possibly even wearing the same pair of pants two days in a row. They're probably stepping out in high hemlines and low-cut blouses, keeping warm with the twin powers of alcohol and frolicking with lusty fellow students. So make sure they have a couple of changes of bed linen. Dear student, When you're giddy with thoughts of starting uni, busy with your own plans of what to take and what to wear, whether you'll make friends, cope with the workload and fit everything into the back of the car, it can be easy to forget about how your parents might be feeling. For a good 18 years or so, they've been doing your washing, cooking your tea and nagging at you to tidy your bedroom for crying out loud. Once you've gone, they'll have to plod along in the old routine but with a strange you-sized hole in their lives. So you have to forgive them if they call you a little too often, if they fuss and fret about where you're going, what you're doing, and, indeed, who you're doing it with. Be a little kind. Don't just call home when you want something: money/ your granny's address/ more money. A weekly phone call home to tell them what you've been up to (or at least the edited highlights) and to find out how they are, wouldn't go amiss. Remember that you must reassure them on the following points: (a) yes, you are eating a nutritious and wholesome diet, full of legumes and lovely fresh fruit; (b) you are spending considerable time in the library and are really enjoying learning about postwar economics; (c) you're really glad that you packed that extra jumper. Inevitably, at some point, your parents will ask whether you are \"courting\". It is quite permissible for you to be vague and monosyllabic here. Before you leave home, reassure your mum and dad that you will be just fine and that of course you will call if you need anything. Let them help you pack your belongings (NB: when you arrive at your student digs, your mother will probably unpack everything, too). Saying goodbye to your mum and dad is really, really horrible. No matter how much you've gabbled on to your mates about wanting some independence and how you're gagging at the bit to get those foxy young undergrads into your palace of seduction, the moment that your dad stands up and says something along the lines of, \"Well... we'd best be making a move if we want to avoid that traffic...\" a nasty big knot will form in your throat, and hot little tears will spring to your eyes. At the risk of seeming like a particularly syrupy episode of Dawson's Creek, maybe take a few cheesy minutes to thank your parents for everything they've done to help you get to university. At the end of this, you can all embrace warmly and wait for the title credits to roll."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
