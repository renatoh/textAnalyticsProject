The hall was eventually built underground to preserve the view. Unfortunately, someone forgot to soundproof the ceiling, rendering the plaza above useless. Guards are now permanently employed to stop people walking across it. Almost entirely destroyed during the second world war (only 6% survived), many parts of the city - most noticeably its numerous churches - have been meticulously restored. In other areas impressive new buildings have sprung up, making the city a hogde-podge of styles. Probably the best time to visit the city is during the carnival season. Bizarrely, this starts at the eleventh minute, of the eleventh hour, of the eleventh day, of the eleventh month. It lasts, on and off, throughout the winter, culminating in a weeklong festival. Six days before Ash Wednesday the women in the town kidnap the city's mayor and the \"Karneval\" proper starts - work is all but suspended for the duration and everybody dresses up and drinks a lot. And for the rest of the year, here are a few pointers. Bring your drinking boots Straight to the point: visit a beer hall. Don't scoff at the size of the glass, which you might think more suitable for tequila; a waiter will repeatedly fill you up until you place a beer mat on top. Eat Bratwurst, bellow a lot, but don't mention Dusseldorf - Cologne's neighbouring city and arch enemy. Stock up on sandals Buy some Birkenstocks. As Guardian readers surely know, these sandals are no longer the sole preserve of German hippies and vegans. The added benefit is that they cost roughly the same in euros as they do in pounds and come in some unusual colours and materials - though it's perhaps best to avoid the PVC versions. Trek up and down the pedestrianised shopping area of Hohe Strasse for bargains. Stay in a Bad Lemon From the inside, the brand spanking new Intercontinental Hotel in Cologne is a pretty swanky affair and, given that it was built at a cost of 220m euros, unsurprisingly comes complete with a Holmes Place gym among its numerous facilities. It also has some fantastic views of the cathedral from the glass elevator. From the outside, however, it's no beauty queen, hence the Bad Lemon award from the city for this year's worst architecture. The hotel's bar, a New York outpost serving fabulous cocktails and replete with grand piano and lounge singer, is fast becoming a place to be seen. Get inspired Visit the fourth biggest cathedral in the world, and one of the most gothic. All but a small corner of the Dom survived the war - the damage is still visible to the left of the entrance. Building began in 1248, when it was planned to be the biggest cathedral in the world, but by the time it was completed 300 years later it had been surpassed. Considering that its spires, some of which you can climb, rise up to 157m, it's astonishing that it actually survived the war when so little else did. Pilgrims used to journey to the cathedral from all over Europe to see the Magi's Shrine at the centre of the cathedral, where legend has it that the remains of the three wise men are kept. Nobody really believes this anymore, but the cathedral is still well worth the visit for its brilliant stained glass windows and intricate mosaic floors. Take in a little culture Wander around the Wallraf-Richartz Museum. The museum is impressive for its collection - which takes you right up to the impressionists with some of Monet's more unusual lily pond paintings - but also for its design. Built in the Bauhaus tradition, the museum's staircases give you some vertiginous views of the city, and cleverly allow the natural light to flood the galleries. The further up you go, the more modern the paintings are. On the second floor you'll find a collection of 15th-century paintings of Cologne, complete with its original wall and churches, some of which are still standing. They give you some sense of what was lost during the wars of the 20th century. Enjoy a thermal bath Surrounded by the greenery of the Rheinpark at the foot of the city's most northern bridge across the Rhine is the Thermalbad, a Roman-style thermal water spa. Its naturally occurring thermal mineral water has been state accredited, apparently, to prove just how clean it is. You would hope it has nothing to do with the distinctly murky nearby river Rhine. The spa is divided into two parts, both packed with steam rooms, saunas, jet pools, swimming pools, plunge pools and mud baths. The two sections, which are separated by a thick metal door, have outdoor lounger areas. In one part swimming costumes are necessary, in the other they're not. Make sure you can understand the German signs - despite everyone already being naked, walking into the men's changing room isn't my best memory. Ride the cable car Designed for four people, the cable cars take you from the thermal baths to the zoo over the river. I took the 15-minute ride alone, without breathing or moving and quietly ommming. One hundred metres above the Rhine is not the best place to develop a fear of heights. But it is a good place from which to view the length of the Rhine, the city and out to the countryside. Eat your heart out Make yourself sick at the chocolate museum. For a truly Charlie and the Chocolate Factory experience, head for the chocolate museum, which sits on a small headland jutting into the river next to the new sport museum. The only chocolate museum in the world that isn't attached to a company, it displays everything from the Inca history of chocolate to Victorian chocolate crockery. But the most fun is had in watching the chocolate-making process, and you can taste the product at every step of the way, from the raw beans to the huge vats of liquid chocolate. Quite what is so interesting about how they get the liqueur into chocolates, or the magnetic centrifugal systems which distribute the chocolate evenly through a chocolate heart mould, I don't know, but something is. There's lots of chocolate to buy, too. (Buy some at half the price in the local supermarket.)
