He might only stay until the end of the season, but as the coach with the best wins-per-match record in the history of the European Cup his pedigree suggests he is capable of rousing Bayern for their tilt at the Bundesliga title. But I cherish him for a decision he made 14 years ago, one for which Eintracht Frankfurt fans are yet to forgive him. Back in the early 90s, in the pre\u2011internet dark ages for garnering club-focused daily news, technology had not progressed much beyond Dial-A-Disc and Prestel. Then some bright spark decided to marry the two, advertising dedicated premium phone lines on ITV Teletext. Every time you called up a page, it would scroll through lists of services to call at 50p a minute, luring you in with tantalising but equivocal headlines such as: \"Leeds to swoop?\" Such was the susceptibility to that kind of hook where I worked that each quarter we would await the telephone bill with trepidation in case our boss had asked for an itemised one. Leeds United's bombastic managing director, Bill Fotherby, was the star of the club's official service. Almost every month he would be engaged in the pursuit of some exotic star or other and would happily divulge the details. It was his labyrinthine and ultimately fruitless negotiations to sign Thomas Skuhravy, Ruben Sosa and Faustino Asprilla that really pummelled the phone bill. In January 1995, however, he pulled off a coup, one that was trailed on Clubcall with a flashing banner reading \"Leeds sign African superstar\". The absence of the qualifying question mark seemed promising and indeed, after investing only \u00a31.50 to sit through some reserve-team news, I discovered that the superstar in question was Tony Yeboah. He, along with Jay-Jay Okocha and Maurizio Gaudino, we were informed, had fallen out with Frankfurt's manager, Heynckes, and the Ghanaian would be joining Leeds on loan until the end of the season. The profile they had of him was rather sketchy but Fotherby seemed genuinely chuffed, waxing about his prolific scoring record in the Bundesliga and his partnership with Abedi Pel\u00e9 for the national side. I went to Elland Road for his first game, a 4-0 victory against QPR, when he came off the bench after the man he replaced, Philomen Masinga, had scored twice. The scale of the man was the thing that stuck in the memory and over the coming months it would provoke semi-homoerotic tributes to the awesome size of his thighs and bulk of his backside. When he got into the starting XI he scored eight times in his first nine games and his power, occasionally languid grace and exceptional dead-eyed finishing saw him fully embraced by the crowd. The loss of Eric Cantona in 1992 left a hole in Leeds fans' hearts that all the vilification of the Frenchman for his defection could never fill. For a short time, though, Yeboah plugged the gap, never more so than in the club's run to European qualification at the end of that season. The chant \"Who needs Cantona, when we've got Yeboah?\" required you to mangle the pronunciation of Tony's name to get it to rhyme, but it was sung with full-throated glee as Cantona languished in France after his ban for kicking Matthew Simmons. The following season things got even better \u2013 that stunning, dipping goal volley against Liverpool, the goal of the season against Wimbledon, a hat-trick away to Monaco, a brilliant 25-yard strike against Sheffield Wednesday and a barnstorming run from the halfway line and subtle chip over Peter Schmeichel in a Christmas Eve 3-1 victory over Manchester United. But it all unravelled so quickly, the humiliation at Wembley by Aston Villa in the 1996 League Cup final proving the symbolic if not the actual end of Howard Wilkinson's reign. Injury struck Yeboah, then George Graham, like Heynckes, used the striker's weight as an excuse to sideline him. He stuck him on the bench and limited him to the odd run-out as the new manager made it clear he did not rate him. Hauling him off at White Hart Lane proved one insult too many and Yeboah hurled his shirt at Graham, an unforgivable act that was, nonetheless, forgiven by the fans. He went back to Germany and gave sterling service to Hamburg for another few years. But the memories of how he lit up Leeds for a year and banished the age of austere and sterile football that was characterised by Carlton Palmer's ponderous performances in midfield still endure. Leeds, sadly, are no longer in a position to capitalise on Heynckes's mistakes but I, for one, will for ever be in his debt for the gift of Yeboah."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
