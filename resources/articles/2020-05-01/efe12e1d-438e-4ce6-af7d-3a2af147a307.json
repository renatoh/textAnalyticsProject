Top stories The world has seen its biggest one-day increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases, with the World Health Organization issuing a strong warning that the pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases emerged in the past 24 hours, with infection rates in Latin America growing rapidly. The EU\u2019s coronavirus chief said that between 85% and 90% of the population remain susceptible to the virus, meaning a second wave of infections is only a question of \u201cwhen and how big\u201d. Donald Trump has accused China of \u201cmass worldwide killing\u201d, with the US president also inviting censure over comments that American\u2019s figure of 1.52m positive infections was a \u201cbadge of honour\u201d and indicative of its rigorous testing regime. A leaked draft document before the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission has recommended that Australian taxpayers underwrite an expansion of the domestic gas industry. The report makes little reference to renewable alternatives and does not mention climate change, recommending instead the opening of new gas fields and the building of hundreds of kilometres of new pipelines, including a mooted $6bn trans-Australian pipeline. A new Coalition discussion paper has also flagged examining \u201cemerging nuclear technologies\u201d as part of Australia\u2019s energy mix, as part of its technology roadmap towards 2022, 2030 and 2050. Rents in major Australian cities have fallen to 2013 levels, with figures released on Wednesday suggesting a combination of economic downturn, decreased migration and a glut of unutilised Airbnb lettings are forcing down landlord expectations. Victoria\u2019s attorney general tabled data this week that suggested renters are paying 31% less on average, due to the coronavirus. Elsewhere, unions have renewed calls for a government bailout to support ailing airline Virgin Australia, despite administrators expressing confidence the carrier has sufficient cash reserves to see it to a potential mid-June sale. Australia Labor and the Greens are calling for an audit into $150m of Coalition pre-election commitments, with just $9m for female sport facilities being delivered, more than a year after the money was pledged. $35m has been allocated in Australian Research Council grants to 77 projects, including studies looking into the extent of LGBT conversion therapy in Australia, shark deterrence, and offshore oil and gas prospecting. The federal government is considering a request from employer groups for urgent legislative reform, after a federal court judgment found that casual staff could receive further entitlements if they performed regular, permanent work. The koala population at NSW\u2019s proposed Shenhua coalmine faces localised extinction, with company documents suggesting habitat clearing will accelerate a decline in numbers, already under severe duress from bushfires, drought and chlamydia. The world \u201cCatastrophic failures\u201d are responsible for tens of thousands being evacuated in Michigan, where overflow from a decommissioned dam threatens major flooding for towns downstream. Benjamin Netanyahu has been ordered by an Israeli court to appear in person at the opening day of his trial for corruption, after the prime minister\u2019s bid for an exemption was rejected. The 70-year-old faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Oxfam International will close operation in 18 countries and lay off nearly 1,500 staff, with the Covid-19 pandemic dramatically affecting the global aid organisation\u2019s financial circumstances and magnifying the fallout from the Haiti sex abuse scandal. Attacks on a mosque in northern Afghanistan have killed 14 people, on the eve of US-brokered peace talks between the newly united government and the Taliban. The Taliban admits killing nine militiamen but denies targeting the civilians. Recommended reads It\u2019s a satirical lifestyle show \u201cfor a world in which nobody has a life\u201d, but will the ABC\u2019s Home Alone Together stay punchy as Australia emerges from lockdown? \u201cIt\u2019s good to see the ABC back such a worthwhile experiment and lean into full nonsense,\u201d writes Meg Watson. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart move considering the defining art form of the moment has been deeply stupid TikToks.\u201d The latest slowdown of Covid-19 job losses has been touted as good news, but the situation remains very dire, writes Greg Jericho: \u201cIt is good that we are not losing jobs at the same speed we did when the shutdowns occurred (not surprising really), but given 2% of people in their 30s lost a job in the first week of May, only slightly down on the worst weekly fall of 2.85%, it might be a bit early to start relaxing.\u201d It\u2019s a novel about \u201ca bunch of miserable Melburnians waiting to die slowly and horribly from radiation poisoning\u201d, but Nevil Shute\u2019s 1957 classic, On the Beach, is a \u201cdynamite isolation read\u201d according to author Chris Flynn, especially as \u201ca microcosm of 1950s Australian paranoia and inadequacy\u201d. The subsequent film starring Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner and Fred Astaire may not have landed all its punches, but the book absolutely does. Listen The coronavirus in prisons. As lockdowns ease around Australia and people return to a partially normal life, Laura Murphy-Oates speaks to prison staff and prison reform advocates about a potential second wave of Covid-19 that threatens prisons and could put the Indigenous population, and other vulnerable people, at risk.
