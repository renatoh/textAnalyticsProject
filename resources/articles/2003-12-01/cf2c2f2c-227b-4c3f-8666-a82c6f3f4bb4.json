In a compromise deal announced today Sky has agreed to hand over live rights to a handful of less popular matches to another broadcaster, giving ITV and the BBC the opportunity to screen live Premier League games for the first time since the league was formed in 1992. The move could still affect Premier League clubs as BSkyB will expect to pay less than the \u00a31.024bn it had agreed for exclusive rights. Mr Monti said the European Commission had also secured assurances from BSkyB over its wholesale offer of sports channels to other pay-TV companies, an issue over which it has been criticised by competitors in the past. It will also continue to offer pay-per-view games - if it decides to go down that route - to cable companies. \"By creating opportunities for broadcasters other than BSkyB now, and even greater opportunities in the future, the Commission is aiming to increase consumer choice in the UK,\" said European competition commissioner Mario Monti. \"For the first time in the history of the Premier League free-to-air television will have a realistic opportunity to show live Premier League matches,\" added Mr Monti, speaking at a news conference in Strasbourg, France. \"The Premier League has committed to significant changes to its bidding policy,\" he added. The English Premier League also committed itself not to sell the whole Premier League package to a single broadcaster after the 2006-2007 season, the European Commission said in a statement. The compromise came after a weekend of frantic negotiations involving the Premier League chief executive, Peter Scudamore, European competition regulators and BSkyB. Premier League chairmen were told of the deal at a meeting in central London today. If BSkyB and the Premier League had rejected the compromise, the EC said it would issue a statement of objections against the deal calling for the retendering of all the rights and throwing the process into disarray. BSkyB, which originally won the rights earlier this year with a \u00a31.024bn bid to screen 138 live games each season, will sub-licence the rights to eight games a season from the \"copper\" package of 31 live games that kick off at 5.15pm on a Saturday. This would see the company doing a deal with the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 or Channel Five to show eight games a season but the pay-TV giant will still get the first pick of games to show at 1.15pm on a Saturday, 4pm on a Sunday and 8pm on a Monday. The BSkyB will then go back to the Premier League and negotiate a reduction in the \u00a31.024bn it paid for exclusive rights. It has said all along that if it loses exclusivity it will demand a significant reduction in the amount it will pay. Today's compromise will be seen as a home win for the Premier League and BSkyB. The football authority has headed off a serious threat to Premier League clubs, which had feared the television money that has kept them afloat as players' wages have spiralled was about to be slashed. BSkyB has protected most of its live coverage and will pay less for the privilege. It will show 130 live games a year and have first pick of games involving all the big clubs. The terrestrial channels will be left with eight games a season but they are unlikely to involve the biggest clubs. Mr Monti, who launched an investigation into the way the league sells its rights two-and-a-half-years ago, stressed today's agreement was a provisional one and would be subject to a period of public consultation. The Premier League said today the agreement \"meets the commission's competition concerns and strikes a balance between the interests of fans and broadcasters while maintaining the value of our rights\". It continued: \"The announcement leaves in place the new deals already negotiated for the next three years and recognises the changes the league has made to its broadcasting arrangements over the course of nine months of negotiations. \"Crucially this agreement delivers our clubs financial stability and certainty, enabling them to plan for the future.\" The EC, which in recent months has become increasingly outspoken in its public attacks on the BSkyB deal with Mr Monti branding it \"bad for competition on broadcasting markets and bad for consumers\", has been investigating various solutions to resolve the row. It warned that if no compromise was found it would issue a new statement of objections against the league, forcing it to retender the games and throwing the finances of most top clubs into disarray. However, the Premier League has been similarly bullish throughout the negotiations, arguing it has involved the EC every step of the way and insisting all the rights were sold in a fair and open manner. The dispute is the latest attempt by Mr Monti to bring the sale of sports rights into line with other industries. The commission had argued that the way the rights was sold was anti-competitive because it resulted in fans only being able to watch live Premier League football on pay-TV. As a result the league expanded the number of live packages on offer from two to four and the number of games to 138. It also introduced an \"as live\" package featuring the remaining 242 games. However, BSkyB still scooped all the live games in a \u00a31.024bn deal then further enraged Brussels officials by picking up the \"as live\" package and the rights to show games in full on the internet for an estimated \u00a360m. Premier League officials and MPs have spent the last few months furiously lobbying European officials in a bid to defuse the row. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
