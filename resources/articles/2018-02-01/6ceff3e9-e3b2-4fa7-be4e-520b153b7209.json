Bronze, who will captain England for the first time on Thursday night in the SheBelieves Cup opener against France in place of the injured Steph Houghton, was a key member of the Lioness squads which reached the last four in the most recent World Cup and European Championship tournaments. Even though the sacking of Mark Sampson as manager threatened to fracture and unsettle the squad, the arrival of Phil Neville five weeks ago and the introduction of former captain Casey Stoney as part of his coaching staff have helped to refocus minds with the World Cup in France next summer. England will face the two top ranked teams in the world, Germany and the USA, in their remaining games here, giving Neville the perfect opportunity to test his squad\u2019s credentials. Yet Bronze, who last summer became the first English player to join the four-times Champions League winners Lyon, is in no doubt. \u201cI know from playing in Lyon with all the different nationalities that people are little bit scared of playing England now,\u201d the former Manchester City right-back said. \u201cThat\u2019s different. In the past, I wouldn\u2019t say we were a joke as such but people disregarded us a bit. They didn\u2019t have a huge amount of respect for us as a football team. They knew we would be physical, we still are, but they didn\u2019t think we could play football. \u201cNow, they\u2019re aware we have more angles to our game. We aren\u2019t here to make up the numbers. To have reached back-to-back semi-finals is still an amazing achievement. There aren\u2019t many teams who have held that level of consistency, but it still leaves a sour taste in the mouth to have not gone on to reach a final and that has to be the target at the World Cup. We have never entered a tournament not wanting to win, but we are going to be one of the favourites.\u201d Leaving England for France was a huge move for Bronze \u2013 and women\u2019s football in this country considering Lyon\u2019s stature and trophy cabinet \u2013 though the switch is already paying huge dividends. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got a bit more composure on the ball,\u201d said the 26-year-old, who admitted some of the younger members of the England squad have had to resort to YouTube to learn about Neville\u2019s playing career. \u201cI play with some of the best players in the world every day so I should be getting better. It\u2019s a challenge, I have to push myself every single day just to hold my own technically. \u201cI don\u2019t get kicked as much. I wake up in the morning with less bruises and scratches. The English league, although it\u2019s one of the better leagues, it\u2019s more physical. The French league is more technical. Which is good, because that is what I went there for. I wanted to get better technically.\u201d Neville, meanwhile, has been quick in attempting to make his mark on the squad and instil the kind of discipline and attention to detail which served him well during his playing career with Manchester United, Everton and England. A player leaving a water bottle on the pitch at the end of his first training session may appear trivial yet the 41-year-old distinctly felt otherwise, something with which his former manager Sir Alex Ferguson would certainly concur. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to raise the bar in terms of every facet of performance and so far what I\u2019ve seen is that they have risen to every challenge that I\u2019ve set them apart from leaving a water bottle on the training pitch, which I wasn\u2019t happy about,\u201d said Neville, who hauled the guilty party off the team bus to correct her error. \u201cDoing that is unheard of so we talked about the standards that I want from them as a team, the kind of thing which was instilled into me from my parents, from the managers that I played for. \u201cThe little things matter. They are on top of timekeeping but I\u2019m a stickler for standards. We\u2019re going to be all in it together from the kit man to the security to the media. Then we all share it together. They get it. They know full well. And do you know what? They want me to pull them on things like that. \u201cLeaving the kit man to pick up a bottle of water is, for me, as big a crime as giving the ball away. That said, I have been really surprised by the standards they have set themselves and how they have policed themselves \u2013 which is even more important.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
