I try to go to the gym every other day but I am not very motivated. My one vice is Stella Artois, of which I can only have four before I go mad. I get the usual bloating, so I have my 'bifidus digestivum' in the mornings. Now there's a made-up name if ever I heard one - it's that Danone Actimel stuff. I'll have a bit of that and give me some Cillit Bang while you're at it. I have invented a diet that I am marketing at the moment, called the mushy pea diet. It's the only food I know where you get twice the amount out that you put in. I am going to go for one of those food allergy tests. I had some cheese the other day and it took the skin off the roof of my mouth. That's not normal. And tomatoes - I used to love them but give me a slightly tarty one and you won't see me for a while. \u00b7 8 Out Of 10 Cats is on Fridays at 9.30pm on Channel 4"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
