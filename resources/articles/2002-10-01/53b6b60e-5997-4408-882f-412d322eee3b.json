Pan Macmillan had bought it on the back of three chapters - none of which contained the \"Sven\" word. They had been impressed by the quality and power of her writing; they had read a fascinating description of her early life in Sweden, some details about her shocking relationship with Stan Collymore and a harrowing account of her discovery that her daughter Bo had a major heart defect. Ulrika was writing the story of her life but in no particular order. She was just penning things according to whatever she felt strongly about at the time. The book was to be published in spring 2003 in order to avoid the glut of celebrity autobiographies that were being published this autumn. This was not a celebrity story, this was a \"woman's story\"; it was a story that women would relate to across the country; it had practically every experience in it from troubled childhood, to rape, to beating, to ... well need I say more, you now know it all (well, nearly). Signature did not happen until the end of March but Pan Macmillan were still unaware that they were sitting on dynamite. Ulrika Jonsson had been having an affair with Sven Goran Eriksson since the beginning of January and only the very inner sanctum knew. So speculation of a \u00a31m deal is entirely flattering but entirely false. There was no way that I was going to use this privileged piece of information as a form of negotiation. The potential of my client's happiness held a far greater value and I had no idea how this relationship was going to pan out. Until, that was, on 18 April when I received a phone call from Mirror editor Piers Morgan and knew this story was about to blow wide open. One of the extraordinary anomalies of timing that was about to occur throughout this operation was that the press announcement had still not been made. The press officer had been on holiday and since it was a book destined for 2003 it seemed like there was no particular rush. Now, everything was about to change. It was decided to announce the book immediately and unfortunately it looked like the whole thing had been immaculately timed as part of a massive publicity stunt. Oh well. Pan Macmillan could not believe their luck. But, apart from having to deal with all the news stories, I was also getting calls from every tabloid desperate to buy serialisation. Unusually for publishing, I had held on to serialisation rights.But for me there was no urgency to discuss serialisation of a book that was due to be published in 2003 although it soon became clear that to follow the original time schedule would be foolhardy. Pan Macmillan decided to bring publication forward to this month but the question on everyone's lips was \"Would Ulrika write the Sven chapter?\" The book was intended to end after the success of her daughter Bo's second heart operation in September 2001. It was an uplifting and positive climax but now the word Sven was out there, it begged a different conclusion. Ulrika was reluctant until she was eventually convinced by all involved, including myself, that since she was telling the story of her life and since Sven had now been the biggest story, though not the most important, it seemed bizarre for him not to be included. Finally, in July, she sat down and wrote the chapter that was going to have a huge impact on serialisation. It was the only thing that the press were interested in. Every discussion about the serial revolved around whether she had written about Sven. At last, under a strict confidentiality agreement signed by seven tabloid newspapers and one glossy weekly, I was able to open the bidding and tell them that yes, she had. However, even though I was fully aware of the value sitting in that one chapter, for Ulrika and I, it was not the main point of the serial. It was essential that whichever newspaper carried it, it ran as true to the book as possible. There were so many press worthy stories in this book, that I didn't want it to be abridged to pap in order to accommodate a desire for headlines. They would only be offered four specific chapters, the most essential being about her childhood, which was the key to so much. They were going to have to run it from October 12 (a date given to me by Pan Macmillan months back with no thought ahead to a possible England game). And they were going to have to bid \"blind\". They were bidding on the basis of the four subject headings that were on offer because, even by this late stage, only three people had ever seen the book, Ulrika, myself and her editor, Gordon Wise (so much for the source in the News of the World who claimed to have seen a first draft), and there was no way I was going to let any newspaper lay eyes on it before they had signed on the dotted line. The secrecy obviously fuelled their fervour. The bidding went wild. Finally, it came down to two publishers, Express and Associated, and here I have to profess an interest. I am (or was) a good friend of Richard Desmond. My client Claire Petulengro is the astrologer across all of his titles and in July, Richard had asked me to oversee negotiations on a big new merchandising project and I had introduced a marketing colleague to look after the product side. So yes, I wanted him to have what I knew would be the most fantastic serialisation but he had to genuinely bid alongside everyone else. If I could just push him to the position of highest bidder then I could feel my decision justified. I did precisely that. However, the Mail on Sunday had put forward a very acceptable and attractive package with the Daily Mail and I did not want to discount them. I was dealing with Ted Verity, an associate editor, someone with whom I instantly connected. I knew that he understood Ulrika and appreciated my objectives so that even though my heart lay with the Express, my head was not going to let go of the Mail. Besides, since the Daily Mail had dealt with Ulrika rather harshly over the past several years, it seemed a good opportunity to build bridges, albeit wobbly ones. At 5pm on Monday September 23, having had a contract drafted by the lawyers Schillings, I emailed it through to the Express. The following day, in order to break the news fairly, I met Ted Verity for tea. He upped their offer but I told him I would now only be in touch should anything change at the Express. That night Ted called me at home and told me they would increase their offer again - by now surpassing the Express - as long as I agreed to sign that night. I declined saying that I had given the Express three days to sign and would stand by that. The following day I received the amendments to my contract from the Express. Having gone through endless conversations over several weeks as to how and when the serialisation should appear in the paper and having suggested that Ulrika would welcome OK! Magazine into her lovely home in November to fulfil that part of their request, I was horrified to note the changes. I phoned them to be told that they wanted to run serialisation in OK! Magazine on October 9 and would run \"the crumbs\" in the newspaper after a three-day gap. If it wasn't so depressing it would have been laughable. When I was told by an executive that Desmond was resolute that this was how it would be done I asked if he was prepared to lose it. \"Oh but Melanie,\" he said. \"There's so much more to lose.\" I knew what that meant; think astrologer, think merchandising deal. On Thursday morning I called Desmond and was put through to his board meeting. He put me on conference call - an attempt at humiliation. I explained that serialisation would not sit well in OK! and that by leaving a three day gap it opened the gates for every newspaper to loot it and claim it as theirs. By the time the Daily Express came out, no one would know who had the genuine article. He wondered why I cared if I was going to get the money, after all, that was all that mattered. \"It was not\" I told him, which was why I had had such extensive conversations with every Editor but as far as he was concerned there was no way he was spending that money without getting it back. Investment in his newspaper was not an option. We said goodbye. I called Ulrika to tell her the news. She was with me. She would rather less money with better treatment. Within the hour my lawyer and I were in Ted Verity's office reading a contract that was a reflection of everything we had discussed and fair enough, the money had returned to the original offer but I knew I had done the right thing. The following day I received a fax from the Express sent at 6.15 pm the previous night, giving Claire Petulengro notice, saying that that they had received an offer \"they could not refuse\". I called Claire and suggested she might want to fire me and see if she could reclaim her contract. \"Never,\" she says, \"We'll survive!\" (and she should bloody know). I called my marketing friend to warn him that I was probably about to be cut out of our deal. He was hugely shocked. He said he had a meeting with them and would call me as soon as possible to fill me in. I never heard from him again. Now, with serialisation behind me, I have to say I did the right thing. I was working with people who understood and through all the tension we managed to find occasion to laugh. Ultimately the only person who suffered from the deal with the Mail was Claire and she's still confident of success. Perhaps it was all written in the stars. \u00b7 \u00a9 Melanie Cantor 2002"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
