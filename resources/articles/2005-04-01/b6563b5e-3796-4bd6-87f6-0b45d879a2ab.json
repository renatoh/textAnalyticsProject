If this trend continues, those starting a three-year degree course this autumn are likely to leave college with debts of nearly \u00a320,000, without taking into account the impact of higher top-up fees of up to \u00a33,000 a year to be introduced next year. The 11th Barclays Annual Graduate Survey also shows that a quarter of students with debt borrowed money from parents, relatives or friends. The bank says this high level of debt could adversely affect graduates' ultimate ability to get on to the property ladder or invest in pensions, and could deter others from going to university in the first place. One glimmer of hope on the financial horizon is that overall fewer graduates are now in debt (a fall from 80% last year to 73% this time), which could be down to a larger number of students taking a gap year to earn money before starting university. Most of those in debt are opting for the cheapest way of borrowing, with the majority going to the Student Loan Company before other sources of funding. Some 86% owe money to the company, with the average amount owed being \u00a310,646. Jeremy Law, head of student and graduate banking at Barclays, said: \"As predicted, graduate debt is continuing its upward trend, due to a number of factors, including rising living costs and a more resigned attitude towards debt. If this continues, students starting a three-year course this September could be graduating with debts of almost \u00a320,000. \"Graduates will find themselves with debts for years to come which may affect their ability to buy homes and invest in pensions. Prince or pauper, these levels of debt may act as a deterrent to some people considering going to university.\" Mr Law added: \"I would encourage graduates to seek expert advice if they are experiencing any financial difficulties. Graduates should consolidate their borrowing and pay off the debts with the highest interest rates first by making use of the cheapest borrowing options, for example interest-free graduate overdrafts or graduate loans,\" he added. Hannah Essex, vice-president (education) of the National Union of Students, said the organisation was extremely concerned by the latest figures, particularly because debt was increasing at a rate well above inflation. \"This means that students are being forced to turn to expensive credit cards and bank loans to cover their basic living costs. Graduates are building up debts that have to be paid off, regardless of whether or not they are in employment,\" she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
