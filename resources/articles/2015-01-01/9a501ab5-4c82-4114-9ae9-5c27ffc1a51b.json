After the frying-pan of directing Lindsay Lohan in The Canyons comes the fire of Dying of the Light, a punch-drunk terrorist thriller that wound up being confiscated by the backers and re-edited behind his back. The finished film is a hobbled orphan, disowned by its director and often wheezing when it should be raging. If its heart still beats, that\u2019s solely thanks to Nicolas Cage\u2019s barnstorming performance as rogue CIA operative Evan Lake, battling dementia as he pursues an old tormentor. Voice hoarse, hands trembling, Lake burns bridges with abandon, alienates supporters and proceeds to sail off the map in pursuit of his lost cause. I\u2019m seeing him as a fairground mirror image of the man behind the camera."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
