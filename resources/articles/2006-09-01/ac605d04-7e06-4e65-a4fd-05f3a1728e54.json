Pre-tax profits were 25% lower at \u00a366.5m, hit by \u00a319.1m of investment in new businesses and higher UK marketing costs. But the lender said its core UK business, which mainly lends to poorer families at rates up to 50%, had grown 1% to 1.47 million borrowers. Provident also confirmed the demerger next spring of its growing international arm, focused on central Europe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
