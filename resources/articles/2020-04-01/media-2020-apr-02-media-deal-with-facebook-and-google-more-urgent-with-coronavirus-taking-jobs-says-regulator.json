Chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, said he was confident a new code regulating the relationship between Facebook, Google and Australian media would be in place by November and earlier if the government chooses to step in. A key recommendation of the ACCC\u2019s digital platforms inquiry was to introduce a code of conduct to ensure news businesses on digital platforms are treated fairly and transparently. \u201cOur media companies are in great difficulty, so that bargaining code that we\u2019re facilitating between the media companies and the platforms is just all that more urgent,\u201d Sims told ABC radio. \u201cI think they were very much weakened by the impact of the digital platforms. It\u2019s been a one-two blow: digital platforms and then corona.\u201d News Corp Australasia executive chairman Michael Miller repeated calls for the government to force digital platforms to pay for the content they profit from after suspending printing 60 community newspapers, some of which date back to the 1860s. Miller said Covid-19 did not create the crisis in the media but \u201cbrought it to a head\u201d. \u201cThe unfairness of the digital playing field, along with Australia\u2019s draconian tangle of legislation and regulation means local companies can\u2019t compete with international platforms,\u201d Miller said. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s chief executive in Australia said News Corp had been talking to the digital platforms but had not even got to \u201cfirst base\u201d and had no confidence a voluntary code of conduct would work. \u201cThe government should be ready to institute a mandatory code,\u201d he said. Sims told Guardian Australia the pandemic had not slowed down the commission\u2019s efforts to facilitate an enforceable agreement between the media and Facebook and Google but he doubted the timetable could be sped up. He said the ACCC report on the progress of negotiations would be out in May. \u201cThe government has said that if in May they haven\u2019t made progress we\u2019ll step in and mandate a code,\u201d Sims said. In the meantime Sims urged the government to enhance the regional and innovation grants scheme to help the regional papers which were struggling with no advertising. \u201cIf they want to do something immediately they could do that,\u201d he said. \u201cJournalism is fundamental to society,\u201d Sims said. \u201cWe want both the national coverage, which is what the Guardian does, we also want the local coverage and if this year 2020 can be the year of focused attention on journalism and the media that would be terrific.\u201d Communications minister Paul Fletcher said it was clear Covid-19 had put the media sector under enormous pressure, particularly through sharp advertising downturns. In recent days Nine Entertainment, Seven West Media and News Corp have told staff they have to introduce tough measures to get them through the economic shutdown including pay cuts and working shorter hours. \u201cThe current situation has amplified the long-running structural issues \u2013 particularly competition from global digital platforms which are capturing much of the audience and advertising revenue previously held by television, radio and newspapers,\u201d Fletcher said. News Corp\u2019s decision reflects the fact that advertising which is the mainstay of its community newspapers \u2013 from sectors like real estate and hospitality \u2013 has largely dried up due to Covid-19. \u201cI welcome the fact that News Corp is maintaining these titles in digital form, and I welcome News Corp\u2019s commitment to preserve jobs.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
