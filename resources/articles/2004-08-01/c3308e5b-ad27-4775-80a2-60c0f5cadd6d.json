Some soft-headed types who want to imagine that victims are always morally pristine will find it as enraging as itching powder.\" Justin Cartwright's new novel The Promise of Happiness opens with 68-year-old Charles Judd peeing on the grave of John Betjeman. As James Francken remarked in the Telegraph, \"one waggish character wonders whether his pee was 'some sort of literary criticism'.\" \"Fictional families, in the English novel at any rate, seldom seem quite real,\" complained Christopher Hope in the Independent, but he found the Judd family entirely believable. \"The novel is busy with themes of guilt, redemption, morality and responsibility,\" pronounced Olivia Glazebrook in the Spectator, \"but the characterisation is Cartwright's great achievement.\" \"The elegant assurance of its opening pages induces in the reader an almost incredulous admiration,\" Jane Shilling announced in the Sunday Telegraph, summing up the book as \"a tragedy of noble reticence and oddness\". \"When reading lists are attached to historical novels, it usually suggests some failure of nerve on the part of the novelist,\" warned Claudia FitzHerbert in the Telegraph. \"Bad literary historical novels are in this respect like bad literary biography - they lead you back to the sources, but nowhere much else... So it is with [Margaret] Drabble's The Red Queen...\" But Katharine Sale in the Financial Times enjoyed this \"lively and surprising book\"; though she observed that the \"little-girl voice\" of the narrator-princess in the first half \"veers dangerously close to being terminally cute, but is always saved by Drabble's skill\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
