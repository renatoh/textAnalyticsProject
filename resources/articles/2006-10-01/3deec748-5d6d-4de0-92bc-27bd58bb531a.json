Very amusing, and linked, perhaps unconsciously, to Yeats's remark (in his introduction to The Oxford Book of Modern Verse) that \"in 1900, everybody got down off his stilts; henceforth, nobody drank absinthe\". Well, with this volume, we are very much pre-1900 in spirit. So feel free to dig out a bottle of the Green Fairy and say, with Arthur Symons in \"The Absinthe Drinker\", \"Gently I wave the visible world away ...\" There is still a residual feeling that this, really, is how poets should behave, despite all the evidence to the contrary. I once sat next to Simon Armitage at some awards ceremony and tried to drag him down to my level. Rarely have I been made to feel such a fool. As he looked pityingly at me, it occurred to me in a flash: this is a man who has probably got his pension sorted out. Here, then, are the last British poets to act like poets, those listed by Ezra Pound's Monsieur Verog in \"Hugh Selwyn Mauberley\", who for two hours \"talked ... / Of Dowson; of the Rhymers' Club; / Told me how Johnson (Lionel) died / By falling off a high stool in a pub ...\" At the age of 35, incidentally. Ernest Dowson, the next greatest decadent poet, didn't last as long as that, and Beardsley only managed to live 26 years. (And the magazine that many of them appeared in, The Savoy, lasted just eight issues until it was banned by that ever-vigilant guardian of morals, WH Smith.) There were others who lasted longer, granted, and Lisa Rodensky has included quite a bit of Oscar Wilde and early Yeats to help bulk things out, and perhaps to include the familiar. Familiarity keeps cropping up: Dowson's \"Non Sum Qualis Eram Bonae Sub Regno Cynarae\" (\"I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion\") is hard to dislodge from the head, once heard; Symons's and Dowson's translations of Baudelaire and Verlaine, which were almost up to the standards of the originals, ring their bells (you can compare each one's translation of Verlaine's \"Colloque Sentimentale\"). And there are three poems in this volume called \"Spleen\", not all of them immediately indebted to Baudelaire, although it's hard to shake off the impression that the British decadent movement involved a lot of British poets playing at being French - but as that annoyed so much of the literary establishment, it's easy to see the attraction. Of course, some of the poetry here is pretty ripe stuff, as a character from Wodehouse might put it. As Rodensky observes, there are some parodies which you can hardly tell are parodies. \"Unto my bed last night, methought there came / Our lady of strange dreams ...\" Or \"My love has sicklied into Loath / And foul seems all that fair I fancied ...\" Which is the beginning of a poem by Lord Alfred Douglas and which one the anonymous parody from Punch? (Rodensky has included some of these piss-takes, to show she's a sport.) You can see how a stern modernist might react to lines such as \"Athwart the sky a lowly sigh / From west to east the sweet wind carried ... \", but the supreme modernists, Pound and Eliot, acknowledged their debts to the movement even as they rebuked some of its sillier excesses (and even the poem from which I've just quoted, \"London\" by John Davidson, ends with a beautiful line, \"The heart of London beating warm\", which shows that they could still produce the goods even when they were being carried away). So: put on a floppy shirt, cultivate an attitude of febrile neurasthenia, become completely financially insolvent, and lose yourself for a while in the delightfully clotted atmosphere of these poems. (It's a pity there's no Swinburne.) Now, is there anyone who can score me some laudanum?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
