The Newcastle-born 22-year-old struck 17 fours and a six as the home team racked up a total of 380 for four. He was eventually caught at long off after he miscued a hook from the bowling of Andre Adams. Muchall, who was part of the first England academy intake in 2002-03, put on 167 for the fourth wicket in a partnership with Durham's Kolpak import, the South African Dale Benkenstein. A second hundred partnership between Benkenstein (91no), celebrating his 31st birthday, and the British passport-holding West Indian Gareth Breese (60no) ensured it was Durham's day. Earlier Essex, who used eight bowlers, had Durham in some trouble at 105 for three: Jon Lewis was caught by Adams off Dale Steyn for 24, Nicky Peng was dismissed by Adams for 26, and Nathan Astle was caught by Grant Flower off Ravinder Bopara for 15. The Scotland bowler Asim Butt has been banned for 12 months after testing positive for the recreational drug ecstacy. The 37-year-old, who was tested on May 11 after a Totesport League match against Somerset, will now miss the ICC Trophy in July. Butt admitted the offence when he faced an England and Wales Cricket Board disciplinary meeting. Now Cricket Scotland is preparing its own punishment for the Edinburgh amateur. The chief executive Roddy Smith said: \"We have instigated disciplinary procedures ... and Asim will, of course, be subject to disciplinary action. Hopefully that will be done in the middle of next week.\" Scotland are now hoping to bring the Clydesdale all-rounder Greig Williamson into their squad for the ICC Trophy, from which five teams will qualify for the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
