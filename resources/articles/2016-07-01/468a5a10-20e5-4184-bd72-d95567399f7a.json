In that position it was his responsibility to provide independent challenge and oversight. Instead he was content to provide a veneer of establishment credibility to the group while happily disengaging from the key decisions he had a responsibility to scrutinise. For this deplorable performance he received a considerable salary.\u201d Dominic Chappell \u201cHe had his hands in the till.\u201d \u201c[He] was out of his depth. He was over-optimistic to the point of arrogance.\u201d \u201cChappell accepted responsibility for [BHS\u2019s pension scheme] with a negligent and cavalier disregard for the risks and potential consequences. This negligence continued into [his] incompetent and self-serving ownership of the company. Should Sir Philip come to a settlement with The Pensions Regulator, RAL directors should not escape regulatory investigation.\u201d \u201cHis description of \u00a32.6m that he personally took, in addition to an outstanding \u00a31.5m family loan, as \u2018a drip in the ocean\u2019 is an insult to the employees and pensioners of BHS [who] he let down.\u201d Grant Thornton and Olswang, advisers to Retail Acquisitions \u201cBoth increasingly aware of Retail Acquisitions\u2019 manifold weaknesses as purchasers of BHS. They were nonetheless content to take generous fees and lend both their names and their reputations to the deal.\u201d Goldman Sachs, unpaid adviser to Philip Green and his Taveta group \u201cShould have been either \u2018in\u2019 or \u2018out\u2019 of the deal, and demonstrably so. As it was they had authority without accountability.\u201d PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) \u2013 auditor of BHS under Green\u2019s ownership \u201cWe were surprised that PwC did not more deeply question whether BHS was genuinely being sold as a going concern.\u201d MPs also urged the accountancy watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, to conclude its investigation into PwC\u2019s role \u201cas swiftly as possible\u201d and include PwC\u2019s work in previous years and on the accounts of other Taveta group companies. The Pensions Regulator \u201cReactive and can be slow-moving\u201d and could have \u201cshown more urgency\u201d in assessing attempts to restructure BHS\u2019s pension scheme. Directors of Dominic Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions (RAL) vehicle \u201cBoard members exploited BHS for their personal gain and Dominic Chappell was the worst culprit. Their plans included removing the profitable assets from BHS and placing them directly in RAL ownership, and requiring BHS to use central services, such as property advice, provided by RAL. The suspicions of BHS managers that RAL were more intent on taking money from the business than investing in it were well founded, as evidenced by the \u00a311m charged by RAL to BHS in the form of salaries and fees. \u201cStephen Bourne and Mark Tasker jumped ship on the day that RAL acquired the business with personal financial rewards that it would take many BHS employees decades to earn. The others, Eddie Parladorio, Lennart Henningson, Keith Smith and Aidan Treacy, continued to profit handsomely from their positions without fulfilling their requisite responsibilities\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
