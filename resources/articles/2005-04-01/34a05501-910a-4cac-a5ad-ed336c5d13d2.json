But unless they manage to upset massive odds and carry off the European Cup in Istanbul on May 25, it will be hard to take this Liverpool team seriously until they stop losing league matches against lesser opposition with the kind of passive performance they gave against Crystal Palace last Saturday, drawing criticism even from inside their own ranks. What they need to do is adopt the approach of Jamie Carragher as the baseline of their performance in every match, not merely in semi-finals of the Champions League. Carragher was widely acclaimed as the star of the draw they took away from Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night, his two decisive interventions in the final phase of the match keeping Liverpool's hopes alive. With 12 minutes of normal time remaining, he cleverly dispossessed Mateja Kezman at the end of a dribble that looked as though it might produce something. Five minutes later Kezman was waiting to hit a dropping ball from point-blank range in the penalty area when Carragher produced a brilliant intervention that left the Serbian substitute swinging at thin air. Given the notably wan form of Steven Gerrard in recent months, Carragher has become the flavour of the month among those seeking to identify a local hero among Liverpool's ranks. He has grown in stature and presence on the pitch, to the point where he provides the emotional reference point for players coming into the squad, particularly from abroad. When Rafael Ben\u00edtez made it clear very quickly last summer that St\u00e9phane Henchoz would have no place in his plans, Carragher stepped up to establish a new partnership with Sami Hyypia in central defence. He was reverting to the position he had played through the ranks of Liverpool's youth teams until G\u00e9rard Houllier reinvented him as a utility player, a decision copied by Sven-Goran Eriksson. Now Carragher is being acclaimed as a credible addition to England's ranks of international-class centre-backs, ready to join Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry and Ledley King among the specialists. And if Campbell is nearing the end of his international career, as seems likely, then Carragher might find himself challenging Terry for the Arsenal man's No6 shirt in Eriksson's line-up. But Carragher's display was not the only one worthy of note from among the ranks of the club's less starry players on Wednesday. Djimi Traor\u00e9, when he was not complaining about real and imagined injuries, put his long legs in the way of Joe Cole's dribbling effectively enough to ensure that the Chelsea man, in confident form, was unable to come up with the end product. Igor Biscan, deputising for the injured Didi Hamann, did little wrong and much that was right, in an unobtrusive sort of way. Between them Traor\u00e9 and Biscan provided a reminder that Houllier knew how to pick players but was not necessarily the best man to coach and motivate them. Of Liverpool's 11 starting players and seven substitutes on Wednesday, only three - the Spanish trio of Xabi Alonso, Luis Garc\u00eda and Antonio N\u00fa\u00f1ez - were not brought into the Anfield first-team squad by the much criticised Frenchman. And now they are a step away from a European Cup final, the object of Houllier's vanished dreams. We must hope, however, that Tuesday night's return leg turns out to be a match of greater distinction, with fewer misplaced passes from both sides. On Wednesday, even the most reliable distributors -Alonso for Liverpool and Claude Makelele for Chelsea - were regularly making a present of the ball to their opponents. It was a contest characterised by incessant pressing and closing down, and by the phenomenal physical fitness that allows modern players to maintain maximum effort throughout the full 90 minutes. Under the suffocating pressure, moments of high skill revealed themselves. Makelele, Cole and Frank Lampard occasionally nicked the ball away from an opponent with astonishing deftness before initiating one-touch triangular movements at high speed. But the overall impression was of sheer effort cancelling out invention. It is hard to imagine either of these teams getting away with such tactics against Milan in the final, should Carlo Ancelotti's team exploit their 2-0 lead from the home leg and, as expected, dispose of PSV Eindhoven in Holland on Wednesday night. Space, possession and patience are Milan's tools, as Sir Alex Ferguson would attest. Premiership-style intensity alone is unlikely to prevent them collecting the trophy for a seventh time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
