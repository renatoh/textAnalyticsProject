Henson said in an interview over the weekend that he was in talks with Ospreys, where he is under contract for the rest of the season having taken unpaid leave for the past 13 months, \"trying to sort it all out\". Henson's discussions have taken place at board level. The Ospreys coaching team have not been involved and a source at the region said no one was anticipating his return there and that everyone had moved on. Ospreys would want a fee to release Henson, who has been linked with a move to the Aviva Premiership. Wales have missed him more than his region and the national coach, Warren Gatland, is monitoring developments. \"I think he will end up at a club and I see that a couple have been talking to him,\" said Gatland. \"Ideally we would like to keep him, but perhaps he is looking for a move out of Wales for a fresh start, getting away from the goldfish bowl. If he is to put himself in the frame for the World Cup, he has got to return sooner rather than later: the new year may be too late.\" Henson said he had no pending television commitments and that he had been training hard through necessity. \"I did not miss rugby for the first six of seven months. I would choose to be a full-time father a hundred times over rugby or other work. I'd certainly put my career on hold to being up my kids but I'm not in a position not to work again: I need money like the next person.\" Scarlets left with red faces The opening day of the new season proved to be a happy one for the underdogs. Exeter made light of Gloucester in their first match in the Premiership, but their achievement paled in comparison to Treviso. The Italians marked their Magners League debut with a 34\u201128 home win over the Scarlets having looked out of it at half-time when they were down by 13 points as well as a man, with Manoa Vosawai in the sin-bin. Connacht thrashed Newport Gwent Dragons 40-17 in Galway while last season's finalists, Ospreys and Leinster, slipped up on Friday, away at Ulster and Glasgow respectively. Saints get political Who says sport and politics do not mix? The Northampton chairman, Keith Barwell, used his column in yesterday's programme for the match against Leicester to warn the Liberal Democrat majority on Northampton borough council that it faces being thrown out in next year's elections for continuing to frustrate a plan to develop Franklin's Gardens. Barwell had threatened to take the Saints elsewhere but is now looking at the power of the ballot. \"Most of the cost of our development will be paid for by Asda, who want to build a store on our land,\" wrote Barwell. \"In the council leadership's view, this food store will seriously detract from the town centre but it is smaller than extensions proposed by Tesco and Sainsbury's. We could keep going on this merry-go-round for ever and a day. Fortunately, in eight months we have a borough council election. All major opposition parties on the council are clearly against the Liberal Democrat stance. A good many Lib Dem voters on the national front see the party as having sold them out. They are unpopular in the polls so can they hold on to power locally? I doubt it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
