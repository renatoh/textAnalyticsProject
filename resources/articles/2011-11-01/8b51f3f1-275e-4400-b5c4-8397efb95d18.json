Even the greats like Paul McCartney never think they can't do better.\" You've got to love his cockiness, especially when there's so little basis for it: In Case You Didn't Know is an unapologetically lightweight product by a chappie born to be labelled \"cheeky\", and that's about the size of it. Yet it has more going for it than the usual gagsome treacle associated with X Factor contestants. Refusing to be mired in a swampland of balladry, Murs darts lightly from cute reggae (Heart Skips a Beat) to sax-blaring 50s pop (Dance with Me Tonight) to Bacharach/Davidish lushness (Just Smile), and sounds as if he's enjoying himself enormously. Endowed with a decent white-soul voice that recalls Will Young, he and his tunes are never less than easy on the ear."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
