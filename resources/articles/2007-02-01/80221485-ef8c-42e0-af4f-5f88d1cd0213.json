The three-times world rally champion S\u00e9bastien Loeb usually makes a metronome look irregular, but his famed consistency deserted him on the snowy Rally Norway when he had two accidents on two consecutive stages. The French Citroen driver was in third place and chasing Ford's Marcus Gronholm for second when he went off for the first time, on stage 12. His car slid off the road at a first-gear hairpin bend and became stuck in a snowbank. It took some spectators eight agonising minutes to dig him out. Unbelievably Loeb did exactly the same thing on the very next stage of the event, losing a further nine minutes. \"This was a very complicated rally where you had to rely on luck occasionally,\" said Loeb. \"Sometimes you get away with it and sometimes you don't. That's just how it is.\" Gronholm's young team-mate and fellow Finn Mikko Hirvonen won the race, notching up his second victory at world championship level. Unlike his maiden victory in Australia last year - when Gronholm crashed and Loeb was out with a broken arm - the 26-year-old Hirvonen led from the start and saw off the most experienced drivers. \"Maybe the fact that Norway was a new rally for this year helped me,\" said Hirvonen. \"I felt very confident throughout the event but I did not do anything different to what I do usually.\" Second place for Gronholm means the senior Finn now leads the drivers' championship by four points from Hirvonen, while Ford has also profited from Citroen's misfortune to take a commanding lead in the manufacturers' series. The battle for the final podium place in Norway involved a little family rivalry, as the brothers Petter and Henning Solberg went head-to-head for a slice of national pride on their home event. The Subaru of Petter had a 10sec lead over his brother's Ford in the closing stages but Solberg relled him in on the final day. Of the Britons, Guy Wilks, on his first world championship event in a world rally car, made an encouraging debut before having giving best to a snowbank on the second day. The Ford driver Matthew Wilson also hit trouble, breaking his front suspension. At least snowbanks will not be much of a problem in the next round, starting on March 9, in Mexico."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
