Dingell has been the chairman since the late 1970s (and as a young man, once himself unsuccessfully challenged the longtime chairman of the committee). He represents Detroit, and thus the auto makers, and so has blocked things like stricer emission standards every step of the way. Waxman would be great. Harold Meyerson explains the stakes wonderfully in his Wash Post column today. Brian Beutler reports on his blog that Waxman won a vote today on the House Policy and Steering Committee, which voted 25-22 to recommend that Waxman get the chair. The House Dem caucus (i.e., all House Democrats) will vote tomorrow. The win in today's vote is important, but it may not be a sign that Waxman will prevail tomorrow. The committee is heavy with Nancy Pelosi loyalists, and she's known to back Waxman. So the full caucus will be a tougher climb. But a Waxman victory would mean the potential for vast environmental change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
