Trump allies face Ukraine question", "bodyText": "As Donald Trump repeated his demand that the whistleblower who triggered the impeachment inquiry should be identified, White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway refused to say the president did not offer the leader of Ukraine a quid pro quo involving military aid and the investigation of his political rivals. That is the issue at the heart of impeachment proceedings: whether or not nearly $400m in military aid to Ukraine was illegally withheld, pending Trump\u2019s demand that Volodymyr Zelenskiy investigate alleged corruption involving Joe Biden and other supposed wrongdoing linked to Democrats in 2016. \u201cThe whistleblower got it sooo wrong that HE must come forward,\u201d Trump tweeted on Sunday. \u201cThe Fake News Media knows who he is but, being an arm of the Democrat [sic] Party, don\u2019t want to reveal him because there would be hell to pay. Reveal the Whistleblower and end the Impeachment Hoax!\u201d The whistleblower\u2019s lawyer later said the unnamed CIA official was willing to answer Republican questions in writing, but not to be identified. In a heated exchange on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, meanwhile, Conway refused to answer yes or no when asked if Trump had ever offered Zelenskiy a quid pro quo. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I know they\u2019ve got their aid. Here\u2019s what\u2019s unimpeachably true: Ukraine has the aid, and the Ukrainian president has said he had no idea the aid was being held up and felt no such pressure.\u201d Trump took a different tack. When the president returned to the White House from New York, the Guardian asked him directly if there was a quid pro quo. He said: \u201cNo, not at all, not at all.\u201d Trump, White House aides and their Republican allies continue to attempt to paint a 25 July call between Trump and Zelenskiy as wholly innocent, despite the evidence contained in its own partial transcript and sworn testimony from national security officials. That testimony was given to House members on Capitol Hill in private. After Republican complaints about the closed-door proceedings \u2013 in which Republican representatives took full part \u2013 Democrats this week staged a House vote, clearing the way for public hearings. On Sunday, senior Republicans attacked that process. On ABC\u2019s This Week, Republican House whip Steve Scalise said the House resolution formalising impeachment was passed \u201cin a very partisan way\u201d. On CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said intelligence chair Adam Schiff \u201cand his staff\u201d should be questioned in public \u201cbecause he is the only person who knows who this whistleblower is\u201d. On CNN, host Dana Bash stuck to her guns, asking Conway to \u201cdefinitively\u201d say no quid pro quo was ever offered to Ukraine. \u201cThere was no quid pro quo on this call,\u201d Conway said, carefully, brandishing what appeared to be the partial transcript of the Zelenskiy call. \u201cPresident Trump never said to the Ukrainian president, \u2018Do this and you\u2019ll get your aid.\u2019 It\u2019s simply not here. It\u2019s not in the transcript.\u201d On Capitol Hill this week, Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a national security staffer, testified that he had been concerned by what was said in the call, by steps taken to keep it secret and by what he said were inaccuracies and omissions in the published version. Trump called Vindman a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d, a kind of Republican he recently called \u201chuman scum\u201d. Conway deflected questions about whether the president would apply that description to Vindman, who was wounded in Iraq and who attended his testimony in his army uniform. Whatever the president did, Conway said, again following the party line, it was not an impeachable offense. Speaking to Fox News Sunday, she added that Trump could not be impeached based on interpretations of his actions by White House staffers. \u201cWe impeach presidents of the United States sparingly and because 67 senators say that a democratically elected president needs to be removed,\u201d she said, \u201cnot because a couple of news outlets say there are eight quid pro quos in the transcript.\u201d If the House votes to impeach Trump, as would be expected on party lines, his trial would be held in the Senate. Twenty Republican senators would have to vote against the president for him to be convicted and removed. That remains unlikely. A number of Republican senators have gone so far as to say Ukrainian aid was indeed held up unless Zelenskiy agreed to investigate Biden, but they have added that it was not an impeachable offence to do so. Conway said: \u201cThe reason you see every single Republican vote against an impeachment inquiry is because they haven\u2019t seen evidence of high crimes or a misdemeanour.\u201d On CNN, Bash pressed on. Was Conway confident there was never a quid pro quo? \u201cI feel totally confident Ukraine has the aid and is using it right now.\u201d \u201cKellyanne, quid pro quo. Yes or No?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know whether aid was being held up,\u201d Conway said. \u201cBut I do know that we\u2019re trying to impeach a president \u2026 but why? There\u2019s nothing in this conversation so far resonates in this country, especially in the 17 swing states.\u201d As Conway held the White House line on TV, her husband George Conway was busy on Twitter: recommending articles and books about the impeachment process. A high-profile Republican lawyer, he has emerged as one of Trump\u2019s most vehement critics online and in the press. The mysteries of his marriage remain a hot gossip item."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
