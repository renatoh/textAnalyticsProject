The prime minister won a vote on the EU withdrawal bill at third reading by 330 votes to 231, a majority of 99. Before the election, MPs had thwarted Theresa May\u2019s Brexit bill and threatened to do the same to Johnson\u2019s revised deal. However, the make-up of the new parliament is now strongly pro-Brexit, with Johnson\u2019s sizeable Tory majority. The bill will now go to the House of Lords where peers could give it a more challenging hearing but are still unlikely to block its passage. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman warned the House of Lords, where Johnson does not have a majority, not to frustrate the progress of the legislation. \u201cThe country did deliver a very clear message that they want Brexit to be resolved,\u201d he said. The bill passed without amendment in the Commons in marked contrast to torturous previous efforts of May and Johnson to get Brexit legislation through before the election. Opposition MPs tried to force an amendment committing the government to allowing unaccompanied child refugees to continue to be reunited with their families in the UK after Brexit. The previous government had accepted an amendment from Labour peer Lord Dubs seeking continued protections for child refugees after Brexit but Johnson ditched that commitment after the election. A new Conservative MP used his maiden speech to defend the government\u2019s decision. David Simmonds claimed vulnerable children were \u201cvery much in the minds of many members\u201d, but argued it was \u201cabsolutely right\u201d that these issues should be dealt with in the new immigration bill instead. Speaking of his former role leading the national work across local government on the resettlement of refugees in the UK, Simmonds said: \u201cWhat tends to happen is young people are brought to Britain to be linked up with a distant cousin and in fact, they [end up] in the care system of this country.\u201d He added that young refugees in the EU are \u201calready within countries that have child protection systems that are very similar, equivalent and in some cases better to our own\u201d. But Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said Labour can still \u201cwin the moral argument\u201d after its bid to enshrine protections for child refugees in the government\u2019s Brexit agreement failed. He urged the government to \u201creconsider\u201d its opposition to his party\u2019s plans, adding that Labour \u201cmay not win many votes in this parliament, but we can win the moral argument\u201d. Downing Street stressed on Thursday that it was ready to begin the next stage of the Brexit process - negotiating a trade deal by the end of the year - on 1 February. But Brussels\u2019 chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned the UK\u2019s market access to the EU could be limited unless it agreed to conditions on state subsidies. \u201cIf the UK wants an open link with us for the products \u2013 zero tariffs, zero quotas \u2013 we need to be careful about zero dumping at the same time,\u201d he told a conference in Stockholm. \u201cI hope that this point is and will be correctly understood by everybody. We will ask necessarily certain conditions on state aid policy in the UK.\u201d He also insisted that Britain\u2019s goal to have a full free trade deal by the end of the year was unrealistic. \u201cWe cannot expect to agree on every aspect of this new partnership,\u201d Barnier said, adding \u201cwe are ready to do our best in the 11 months\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
