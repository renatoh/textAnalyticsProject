'We were ahead on every front,' Guccione says. 'When we came into the American market, we were the only real competitor Playboy had. We made the magazine more risqu\u00e9. We began to show pubic hair, which was a big breakthrough. At the time this was referred to as the Pubic Wars, because after about nine months of denial Playboy started to put wisps of pubic hair in their pictures. So eventually they became pubic, too. 'And we became more graphic. We introduced lesbian pictorials. As a matter of fact, everything new in men's magazines - everything - was started by us. We were the first to show full-frontal nudity. The first to expose the clitoris completely. I think we made a very serious contribution to the liberalisation of laws and attitudes. HBO would not have gone as far as it does if it wasn't for us breaking the barriers. Much that has happened now in the Western world with respect to sexual advances is directly due to steps that we took.' There are ironies here. Guccione, who always positioned Penthouse as politically conservative, if only to distinguish himself from the liberals at Playboy, has always run a woman-friendly organisation. Much of the copy, including that accompanying the (ever-more hardcore) photographs, is written by women. Marianne Howatson was just one Penthouse Pet - Pets being the Bunny equivalent - who went into the company as an executive. 'At one stage there was a woman running every one of my departments,' Guccione says. 'Except for the editor and the art editor. That was one thing I learnt early. Give a woman a job and they work three times as hard. They've got more to prove.' Guccione distanced himself from the Hefner style as quickly as he could. 'People who don't know me think badly of me,' he said. 'They think I'm like Hefner. But the fact is I'm not a Hefner. When I give parties I give birthday parties. I don't give parties with stars and celebrities. I don't have that lifestyle and I never had.' I tell him that I had, in fact, been to a party in the house. 'It must have been a charity event.' It had been. When had he last talked with Hefner? 'I only met him once. It was a New Year's Eve party given by Bernie Cornfeld in Los Angeles. He prided himself on being a friend of both Hefner and myself,' he says. This was at the end of the Seventies. Bernie Cornfeld was an iconic figure. The founder of a mutual fund, he had been jailed in Switzerland for defrauding investors, and upon his release lived in immense style in London and Los Angeles. (Heidi Fleiss had begun as one of his 'Bernie's girls'.) 'Hefner didn't expect it. Nor did I, for that matter. At the time he was a big star and I was just up-and-coming. I said I was pleased to meet him. I shook his hand. And he was certainly unhappy about it. I haven't spoken to him since.' Penthouse editor Peter Bloch says, 'Bob's media image has always been that he's a second-rate Hefner. He's the opposite of Hefner.' Bloch describes him without irony as 'a Renaissance man'. Street guys from Brooklyn wear medallions, but so, once, did princes. Machiavelli was a Renaissance man, too, of course. 'Bob would always ask what was going on in the office. The gossip,' a former editor says. 'He loved to plot against his own people, to undercut them.' It was partly self-protective: 'Everyone was always ready to knife him in the back in Bob-land,' says the editor. Guccione's ambitions grew. 'He's got a larger-than- life, Citizen Kane ambition,' Tony Guccione says. 'Penthouse was his platform, and the Vanessa Williams cover in 1984 was the inflection point.' Meaning the zenith. Miss America naked! 'It sold five million issues. Penthouse was outselling Playboy at the newsstands. In the early to mid-Eighties, they were selling up to three million a month.' The cover price was $4 at the time. By the late Eighties, Guccione's art collection was said to be worth between $100m and $200m, depending on who made the valuations. 'Museum directors were calling and asking him to black-tie dinners. Malcolm Forbes would call him,' says Paul Quatrochi, the private art dealer who worked with him from time to time. 'He felt that he knew both sides. He was a buccaneer and an enfant terrible who could also debate with you about first amendment rights. He told me once: \"If I die today, I have lived a full life.\" He felt he was a whole man.' A private man, too. 'I was always a bit shy of the limelight,' Guccione says. 'If I was caught in it I rose to the occasion.' Bloch says: 'If you did see Bob at a party, he would stand in a corner and talk about international politics. Then he would leave after a few minutes. Bob is a total workaholic.' Tony Guccione began to spot weaknesses in the operation. His grandfather, an ordinary accountant, was the financial controller. His aunt was the office manager. 'Nepotism is one thing. The need to function well is another. The company was making $180m a year, but it was run like a corner deli,' he says. Pressures from within Ronald Reagan's America - notably from the Meese Commission and the Reverend Donald Wildmon - were seeing the mag tossed from such choice locations as the 7-11 store chain. But Guccione and Keeton, cocooned in their self-created universe, slalomed from one misconceived project to another. There was the Atlantic City casino, stillborn, partly because an on-site householder wouldn't sell. That was $160m down the drain. General Media, namely Bob and Kathy, launched three magazines over the years - a woman's magazine, Viva; a science-cum-science fiction magazine, Omni, and the self-explanatory Longevity. They were efficiently published - Anna Wintour edited Viva - but they failed; Omni arguably because Guccione and Keeton were stubbornly determined to achieve a circulation base of a million, no matter what. 'They were giving them away,' says a former editor. Omni and Longevity burnt through $100m. Tony Guccione says: 'My father would fund them till they keeled over. It was painful to watch these ventures stumbling - like watching somebody on a drinking binge.' Omni also attests to the couple's enthusiasm for the scientific fringe, and cold fusion in particular. In 1989, two scientists claimed they had proved experimentally that limitless free energy could be harmlessly produced from water. Mainstream scientists failed to duplicate the results and condemned the claims as piffle, which did not deter Bob and Kathy. 'At one point, if you can imagine it, Penthouse magazine was supporting 82 scientists in San Diego,' Guccione recalls. 'Scientists from around the world. We had Russians, Israelis, computer experts, physicists. They were all working on this fusion project. And we were doing very well. But we had reached a point where we needed to create a device which would ignite the plasma. That device would have a life of about one 10,000th of a second and cost $35m dollars to build. And since I was the sole supporter I couldn't go any further. I had already put a lot of money in. But on the way we came up with one or two interesting things. For example, we discovered and created a copper alloy, which is the most formidable copper alloy in the world. Which we have a patent on.' Cold fusion has, so far, proved to be a mirage. The September 1996 issue of Penthouse carried another adventure into wild science - the photograph of an apparently dead alien, along with a thrilleresque account of how the pictures had been acquired from the daughter of a German scientist. Fortean Times, sounding more gleeful than a journal devoted to bizarre phenomena had any right to be, crowed that the 'alien' was a model, fabricated for a TV movie, and that it was presently on display in the International UFO Museum in Roswell, New Mexico. The final scientific adventure became apparent in the summer of 1997, when I was invited to the town house. The other guest was Sue Lloyd, the former British model and actress turned painter, an old friend of Keeton's. The occasion was the publication in Penthouse of 'The $200bn Cancer Scam'. Keeton gave us copies. The story was that Keeton, who had been diagnosed as having 'galloping breast cancer' and given six weeks to live, had already survived two years because she had refused chemotherapy. Instead, she was relying on hydrazine sulphate, a $3-a-day treatment discovered by a scientist about whom Penthouse had been enthusiastic, Dr Joseph Gold. The article implicated chemotherapy in the aforementioned scam and announced that Guccione was mounting a class-action suit against the National Cancer Institute. I still have that issue. It is dated September 1997, the month Kathy Keeton died. But she did have that extra two years... Was Guccione still making contributions to health sciences, I asked? 'At the moment, I can't make contributions to anything,' he said. 'I'm broke.' Paul Quatrochi offered Guccione $20m for his Picasso at the end of the Eighties. He turned the offer down, saying the painting was worth $40m. Poor timing. The bills for the excesses had been piling in and Sotheby's repossessed the canvas in 1992. They sold it to Jeffrei, the brother of the Sultan of Brunei, for $9m. Jeffrei resold it three years later for $12m. 'It was a fantastic investment,' Guccione says, with defensive ebullience. All the modern art went. The Degas, too. 'I miss that the most,' he says. No ebullience here. It is widely believed that it was the deluge of porn on the internet that scuppered Penthouse. Not so, according to Guccione. 'In 1992 I had colossal tax problems. I had to borrow $80m. And I had never borrowed a dime in my life,' he says. 'I paid the interest every year without fail. I never missed a payment. I reduced it to $50m.' A couple of years ago the company agreed to start paying off the capital as well as the interest. Guccione claims that he was incapacitated with cancer at the time and was not a party to the negotiations. 'Those bondholders literally strangled us,' he says. 'They sucked every penny out of the company. I was paying something like $12m a year. It just became too much.' Could he have survived internet porn? 'Sure. We were doing very well on the internet ourselves. I was diversifying in my own industry to allow for these things that were harming us in terms of lost sales. Because competition is not just from the internet. It's from pay-per-view and explicit TV stations. If you want to see some real hardcore sex you can see it on TV on a nightly basis. The delivery systems for the kind of sexual content that used to be in books and magazines are now all over the place. So that's the competition. We were expanding in some areas. Like clubs. Gentlemen's clubs. We now have five clubs of our own and 15 more to come this year. And they do very well.' Guccione's other strategy to combat the high tide of hardcore porn has been more arguable. There's some history here. In the Fifties, Arnold Gingrich's Esquire magazine had a reputation for combining quality writing with saucy visuals, like the Vargas girls. After Playboy was born, and flourished, certain of Gingrich's editors wanted to join combat and up the raunch stakes. Gingrich declined. Esquire took the high road. A generation later, Penthouse forced the same decision on Playboy. As described, Playboy followed down the pubic path. But when ubiquitous hardcore porn updated the challenge in the Nineties, Hefner retreated as Gingrich had before him. Playboy became saucily 'provocative', along the lines of the laddish magazines streaming in from the UK. Not so Penthouse. Guccione's decision to go harder than hardcore made it to the printed page in the later Nineties. 'Pees on Earth', the title of a double-page spread in December 1996, is self-explanatory. Urination, fetishwear and 'facials' (ejaculations) have since been on the menu monthly. 'That's Mr Guccione,' Lainie Speiser, the magazine's director of promotions, says. 'He likes that. He likes to move it forwards. He thinks he's taken it to the next level.' Tony Guccione says, 'He loves to push the envelope. He's a very defiant, aggressive person.' Shortly before his departure, Tony advised a make-over for the magazine, a strategic toning- down. Others agreed. 'It was disgusting. I would say, \"Bob, do we really need these pictures? They're all about humiliation,\"' says a former editor. 'He would say: \"That's what the readers want.\" We would say that it wasn't what the readers wanted and it certainly wasn't what the advertisers wanted. Bob would say: \"When people tell me I'm wrong, that's when I know I'm right.\"' The result was catastrophic, both with advertisers and some important distribution outlets. Clinton, of all people, had Penthouse tossed from PXs, the military stores. And it is even possible that the stubborn publisher didn't take much pleasure in actually executing the strategy himself. He used to shoot three or four of the pictorials a year himself, but had not done so for six or seven years. Why, I asked? 'I got tired of it,' he says, barely audible. Penthouse declared bankruptcy in August last year. It was soon seen as a prize and its value began to mount. Those circling around the property included the inevitable Larry Flynt, Jenna Jameson (a porn star turned mogul) and a Mexican property developer, who announced plans to build a Penthouse-themed resort. They all claimed they wished to keep Guccione on in a major role. A show of just under a hundred of Guccione's canvases and some drawings opened at the Las Vegas Art Museum on 6 September. 'It was well received and well attended. It surprised a lot of people that I was a sincere painter,' Guccione says. So people thought you were... 'A one-dimensional pornographer.' Just two days before Christmas, a hitherto unheard of investors group, PET Capital Partners, who had been snapping up most of General Media's bonds at a discount since August, approached the bankruptcy court with a reorganisation plan. 'We appeared out of nowhere,' says Marc Bell, a Boca-Raton entrepreneur with a history in start-ups, who headed up the operation. Why Penthouse? 'It's a trademark,' Bell says. 'It needed repair, it needed refunding, but it's a very well-known trademark. We're going to look at various aspects. And Bob is going to stay with the magazine.' So, assuming the plan passes legal scrutiny, and if no other hidden entity pops up to snatch the property from Bell's fingers, the magazine should emerge from bankruptcy at the end of the month. Bell is projecting a revenue of $42.8m for this year. Bob Guccione will be the publisher emeritus for 10 years, and editorial consultant, with a salary of $500,000 a year. It's a bittersweet finale. Bob Guccione's East 67th Street palazzo has been unaffected by the travails of Penthouse as his private property, but it had long ago been mortgaged to the lenders on the Atlantic City fiasco. On 16 January there was a published report that Guccione had lost his bid to avoid eviction and has to be out by next Saturday, 7 February. Guccione's lawyer, Robert Feinstein, firmly denies this. For now, the recluse remains in situ. His whole improbable story is not yet over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
