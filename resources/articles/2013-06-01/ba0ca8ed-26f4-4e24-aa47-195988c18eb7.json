The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said an 18-month programme to reduce the disproportionate targeting of stop and search on black and Asian people had led to fairer and more efficient use of the powers. The EHRC report, published on Thursday, says in all five of the forces \u2013 the Metropolitan police, West Midlands, Thames Valley, Dorset and Leicestershire \u2013 the \"hit rate\", or rate of detections and arrests, has risen, despite fewer searches on the street. \"This suggests that the marginal ones, based on the least substantial grounds, have been the ones no longer undertaken, and the ones with firmer grounds have been the ones to continue. In some police force areas, though not all, this process appears to have resulted also in a reduction in race disproportionality,\" it says. The 18-month programme followed a 2010 EHRC report, Stop and Think, which showed that black people were six times more likely to be stopped and searched than white, and Asian people were stopped and searched twice as often. At the time, officers in England and Wales were conducting about 1m stops and searches of members of the public every year. The 2010 report also included evidence that racial stereotyping and discrimination were significant factors behind the figures. The equalities commission entered into formal legal compliance agreements with the Leicestershire and Thames Valley forces to reduce their over-targeting of black and Asian people and closely monitored efforts by the Met, Dorset and West Midlands police to improve the situation. The programme involved promoting intelligence-led stops and searches, rather than officers relying on hunches or generalisations about groups, eliminating the use of performance targets and monitoring of race patterns. The EHRC follow-up report, Stop and Think Again, says that in four of the five forces race disproportionality rates fell as a result of the programme. In the fifth force, the West Midlands, there was not a significant change in the race disproportionality rate, but the use of stop and search fell to only 15,000 in 2010-11 \u2013 half the previous annual rate. The Met's results were more spectacular, with the use of stop and search falling from half a million in 2009-10 to a quarter of a million in 2011-12. The reduction in the black/white stop-and-search ratio was more marked than the change in the Asian/white figure. In one borough, Lewisham, the ratio increased, with the police saying this was because of a new focus on gang activity. Mark Hammond, the EHRC chief executive, said if stop and search was used proportionally and intelligently the police could protect the public, reduce crime and disorder and improve relations with black and ethnic minority groups. \"There is no evidence to suggest that targeting black and Asian people disproportionately reduces crime,\" he said. \"This report shows clear evidence that where forces use an approach based on evidence rather than hunches or generalisations, they have not only seen reductions in crimes rates in line with overall trends, but have also increased public confidence in the police.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
