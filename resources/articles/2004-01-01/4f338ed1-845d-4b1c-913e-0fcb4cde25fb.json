The fact of the matter is that no other woman actor - not even Liv Ullmann, Bibi Andersson, or Eva Dahlbeck - could express as much of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's complex, often tortured view of womanhood as Thulin, who could match his intricacies step by step. As Marta Lundberg, the riven pastor's former mistress discussing the existence of God in the bleak Winter Light (1962) or as Ester, the viciously competing sister with Gunnel Lindblom in The Silence (1963), she was an actor of great beauty and considerable sexuality who could still suggest an intellectual subtlety usually at odds with attractive star personas. That she had a star persona was unquestionable. She was often listed with Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman as Sweden's female contribution to world international cinema. But, in truth, she rarely worked as well for directors other than Bergman and sometimes seemed on auto-pilot when in Hollywood films such as MGM's remake of Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1961) or the later The Cassandra Crossing (1976). In the former, she suffered the indignity of having her dialogue dubbed by Angela Lansbury but might well have considered that the script was hardly worth mouthing in the first place. There were other film-makers who could tap something of her internal passion, but not many. She was excellent as Yves Montand's long-suffering wife in Alain Resnais' La Guerre est Finie (1966) and as the desperate Baroness Sophie in Visconti's The Damned (1969). She was also able to assert her unique acting personality in Mai Zetterling's Night Games (1966), and at least the sexual part of it in the title role of Tinto Brass's scandalous but absurdly overwrought Salon Kitty (1939). She could strip off as provocatively as any Hollywood vamp. But like almost all Bergman's women actors, she needed the challenge of the director's innate pessimism, blighted questioning and intellectual rigour. Once wholly encased in one of his parts, she was able to express pain, pleasure, tragedy and a kind of doomed love like no other. This was rather more than the \"Nordic intensity\" with which she was generally credited, since her grasp of her roles was as much intellectual as emotional and honed by technique as much as inuition. It wasn't at all surprising when, in 1965, she directed and starred in a good short called Devotion and, in 1978, made her feature film debut with the often impressive One and One in tandem with Erland Josephson and Sven Nykvist, regulars with Bergman as actor and cinematographer respectively. She first worked with Bergman, who was then the artistic director of the Malmo Municipal Theatre, after she had studied ballet and then trained at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm in the late 1940s. Her first film for him was Wild Strawberries, in which she played the smallish part of Marianne, the daughter-in-law of Isak Borg, the old professor emeritus who can only come to terms with his sense of failure by travelling back in time to his earliest youth. Though not on the screen too much, she made her mark. That was in 1957 and within 18 months she won the best actress award at Cannes, shared with Bibi Andersson and Eva Dahlbeck for their collective performance in Bergman's The Brink of Life (1958). Her other Bergman films were The Magician (1958), Hour of the Wolf (1967), The Rite (1969), Cries and Whispers (1972) and After The Rehearsal (1984). And if she generally played the mistress rather than the wife, it was probably because her power to express sex but not necessarily satisfaction made such casting inevitable. Being an actor who took her parts with an earnest seriousness that was definitely \"Nordic\", she was once scandalised when a friend said to Bergman of Winter Light: \"Yes, Ingmar, it's a masterpiece. But it's a dreary masterpiece.\" And to counteract the widely held assumption that Bergman was hardly entertainment in the conventional sense, she would insist that there was often much fun and laughter on his sets. \"We worked lightly in even the heaviest parts\", she once said, \"why can't people credit that he and all of us had a sense of humour?\" Thulin was married twice - first to the actor and director Claes Sylwander and then, after a divorce, to the formidable Harry Schein, co-founder and innovative head of the Swedish Film Institute. Schein's influence was partly responsible for her attempt to move into international films. But, unlike Garbo and Ingrid Bergman, she was never quite mysterious enough to cut it in Hollywood as a fascinating European star, nor could she persuade many to think of her as seriously engaged in the ambitions of becoming a Hollywood player. It has been said that Bergman was once asked by Harry Belafonte to direct a film about Alexander Pushkin with Belafonte as the Russian poet and Thulin as his lover. No doubt both would have been richer for the experience, but only in monetary terms. Needless to say, they refused. In her final years, Thulin lived quietly in Rome, returning to Sweden only in her last weeks. She had suffered a long illness bravely. \u00b7 Ingrid Thulin, actor.
