There are a few chills - and occasional laughs - to be had from this post-Wes Craven's New Nightmare tale of a scream-queen actress sent to report from a haunted house. But the sense that Shimizu is simply repeating himself is as hard to exorcise as the titular curse. Isn't it time the director, who clearly has an eye for the uncanny, broadened his horizons?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
