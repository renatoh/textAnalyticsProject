How, we ask, when the Bennett inquiry led to a new set of guidelines on restraint, do deaths continue to occur? First of all it needs to be pointed out that restraint fatalities are believed to be rare - although there are no reliable figures for either injuries or deaths. Nevertheless, the conclusions of individual inquiries - including the latest one, published last week following the death of 37-year-old Geoffrey Hodgkins, a patient at St James's hospital in Portsmouth in November 2004 - illustrates exactly why such deaths persist. Hodgkins died, according to the inquiry conducted by South Central strategic health authority, because of a catalogue of management and operational failures. In other words, his welfare had been neglected at every stage and at every level of the institution responsible for his care. \"There [were] so many failures identified that it is hard to know where to start,\" was how his brother, Bruce, summed up the debacle. It is worth bearing in mind just a few examples of the ineptitude and carelessness Hodgkins endured both on and before the day he died. According to the inquiry, as long ago as 2000, nurses had warned hospital management that Hodgkins had experienced breathing problems while being restrained and had recommended a comprehensive physical health review. It never happened. He was restrained a number of times between then and the day of his death. On the day he died, Hodgkins was held down for 25 minutes by nurses and untrained security guards (the Bennett inquiry recommended no more than three minutes). The position Hodgkins was held in was a similar \"prone\" restraint position - face down - to that used on Bennett eight years ago. Prone restraint is one of a number of widely used methods of restraint and can carry with it a risk of death from asphyxiation, especially if guidelines for its application are not precisely followed or not applied by properly trained and supervised staff. National guidelines on the use of restraint are very clear that it is a last port of call in a situation that might put either patient or staff at risk. \"De-escalation techniques\" - distracting or verbally persuading a patient - should be employed whenever possible to avoid resorting to physical intervention. No such attempts were made during the incident that led to Hodgkins' death. In fact, the inquiry found that he should not have been restrained at all as he had already gone to a separate room on his own and presented no danger. When staff finally realised Hodgkins was having trouble breathing, they were unsure of how to use resuscitation equipment and there were delays in getting an ambulance. That untrained security guards were involved in such a delicate medical incident simply beggars belief. To make matters worse, when the family initially tried to get to the bottom of the circumstances surrounding the death, the Portsmouth City Teaching primary care trust (PCT) failed to provide the information needed, forcing an already distressed family to seek legal assistance. No individuals were found to be responsible for the death. Although the PCT has made a commitment to act on all of the Hodgkins inquiry's 48 recommendations and is developing an action plan, there are unfortunately no guarantees that such a tragic episode will not happen again in the UK. Restraint is a complex issue. For example, there are more than 2,000 techniques being taught in the UK today and there is a shocking lack of research in to their relative effectiveness. Equally troubling is that where there are staff shortages or other problems within mental health trusts, appropriate use and monitoring can be woefully absent. Restraint of any kind is potentially hazardous, but there are guidelines in place - both for restraint and de-escalation. There is no excuse for the incompetence that led to the death of Geoffrey Hodgkins. \u00b7 Mary O'Hara is a Society Guardian staff writer. \u00b7 Any comments on this article?
