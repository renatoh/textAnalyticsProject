He takes up the job on November 1, the day after he steps down after nearly nine years at the European commission in Brussels. Mr Kinnock, currently commission vice-president in charge of reforming the euro-civil service, said he was \"pleased and greatly honoured\" to take over the role in succession to Lady (Helena) Kennedy. \"The British Council's prime function is to communicate the creativity and the best attributes of the UK throughout the world through education, cultural promotion and partnership,\" said Mr Kinnock. \"Its reputation for independence and quality is high and its services are consequently in great demand. \"I greatly look forward to helping to widen and deepen the work of the British Council with an excellent, professional and forward-looking team in the UK and 110 other countries.\" The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, formally approved Mr Kinnock's appointment on the recommendation of an independent panel set up to find Lady Kennedy's replacement. Mr Straw said: \"Neil has extensive experience of international politics and leadership of large organisations, and a strong interest in the wider education and cultural sphere. I know he will deliver a strong vision for the future of the British Council. He will be a great advocate, bringing enthusiasm, integrity and a wealth of knowledge.\" The British Council's director general, David Green, expressed his delight at the decision: \"Neil is passionate about the British Council's work and he is listened to and respected across the world. We look forward to working with him and building on our tremendous contribution to cultural relations which has been made by Helena Kennedy\". The former Labour leader came to Brussels as commissioner in charge of transport under president Jacques Santer. He was one of only four of the Santer team to be reappointed after mass resignations triggered by allegations of mismanagement and cronyism in the Commission. For the past five years he has been one of president Romano Prodi's two vice-presidents, tasked with clearing up sleaze and streamlining a civil service saddled for years with a \"gravy-train\" image. Having served two commission terms, Mr Kinnock must stand down when the current term ends on October 31."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
