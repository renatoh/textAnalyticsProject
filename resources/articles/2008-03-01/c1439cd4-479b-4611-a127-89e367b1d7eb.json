Manager Roy Hodgson could correctly point to the fact that Morten Gamst Pedersen hauled over his marker Paul Stalteri to present himself with a free header from which Blackburn took the lead. But his understandable sense of injustice does little for his team at the foot of the table this morning, with results elsewhere leaving Fulham two victories from safety with just nine games remaining. 'On balance we could have won the game,' said Hodgson. 'If you look at their goal, we actually did win the game. You don't have to put words into my mouth, watch the images and you decide. The right-back was pulled to the ground to give the player who scored a free header. You will see that on TV tonight.' That contentious moment came almost on the hour as Pedersen shrugged off the Canadian defender and headed in, unopposed, from six yards. Moments earlier, the lively American Eddie Johnson had struck the woodwork after chasing Leon Andreasen's through ball and a game that, for the opening 45 minutes, had been unspeakably uneventful, finally burst into something resembling life. It remained that sort of affair until the final minute when Christopher Samba was penalised for a high kick on Johnson and Bullard strode up to curl a magnificent 22-yard free-kick into Brad Friedel's goal. Blackburn manager Mark Hughes, who witnessed his team's European aspirations suffer a major setback with the result, saw little wrong with Samba's challenge or, for that matter, with his team's goal. 'I don't know why they're unhappy with our goal,' he said. 'Morten Pedersen was impeded initially so you could argue it should have been a penalty to us. The lad was holding him and he just freed himself, so fair credit to him. 'Their goal was a great free-kick, great quality but if you watch Chris Samba every week, he clears balls in that fashion. That's one of his strengths. But the referee made the decision and, from our point of view, there's not a great deal you can do if the technique is that good.' Indeed, what sort of season might this have been for Fulham had Bullard been available for all of it instead of completing his recuperation from a knee ligament injury or if Fulham had shown this sort of commitment and composure during an unmatched Premier League run of 31 games without an away victory? Just after the opening goal, Clint Dempsey might have equalised from close range, while Kasey Keller hinted that his recall in goal might have been overdue with a fine save at the feet of Roberts late in the game. 'Of course we can still stay up,' said Hodgson with his parting shot. It was hard to avoid the feeling that Fulham had just wasted their best chance of making their manager's words come true. THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Gordon Moulden, Observer reader Blackburn got what they deserved, Fulham got more than they deserved. I can see why they never win away - they don't even try to win the match. If you come for a stalemate, you'll either lose or, if you're lucky, get a draw. We played poorly - it seems to be difficult for Hughes to motivate the team for matches against teams down the bottom. The first half wasn't even worth mentioning, Fulham just wrapped the game up in a wet blanket. All they tried to do was win a free-kick around the box and that was ultimately our undoing. Jason Roberts changed the game when he came on - he's a great impact player. Benni McCarthy looked uninterested. Fan's player ratings Friedel 6; Ooijer 7, Samba 7, Khizanishvili 6, Warnock 6; Bentley 7, Reid 6, Tugay 5 (Roberts 7), Pedersen 6, Santa Cruz 6, McCarthy 4 (Derbyshire 5) Jamie Ruszczynski, CravenCottageNewsround.wordpress.com Normally that would be a good point, but we need more than that at the moment so it's difficult to know how to react. We were negative in the first half but Hodgson made some attacking substitutions and it paid off, despite conceding a sloppy goal. It's been a difficult season, but when Bullard does something like that it reminds you why you bother going. There was pandemonium when we scored. Konchesky had a good game, solid and getting forward. Eddie Johnson looked lightweight in the first half, up front on his own, but when we started playing balls into channels he used his ace and I think the free-kick we scored from was after he had been brought down.
