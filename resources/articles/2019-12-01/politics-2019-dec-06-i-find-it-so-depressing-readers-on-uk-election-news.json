From the climate crisis to the NHS, few stones remain unturned as politicians compete to offer the most attractive package of policies, and the most damning condemnation of their opponents. Alongside all this is Brexit, which has remained a permanent fixture in British political discourse for more than three years, and shows no sign of waning. Responding to a call-out to Guardian readers about the impact of news, respondents overwhelming reported feeling \u201cdepressed\u201d and \u201chopeless\u201d about current affairs, with some saying it had deeply impacted their mental health. \u201cIt really brings my mood down and makes me feel quite apathetic,\u201d said Chekere Ullanda, 26, from Sheffield. \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s no point caring \u2013 whatever I do, nothing will change. I used to be politically active, but over the past three years I\u2019ve felt I just don\u2019t want to be involved any more.\u201d Ullanda\u2019s words were echoed throughout different age groups, backgrounds and regions. Hilary Haskell, 75, from Oxford, said she was deeply concerned by the \u201cextreme\u201d politics on the rise in Britain. \u201cPolitics has gone to hell in a handcart in terms of reasonable discussion,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re turning into a very nasty, introverted little nation. \u201cI\u2019m really glad I\u2019m the age I am and I haven\u2019t got many more years,\u201d she added. \u201cMy daughter decided not to have kids, and actually I\u2019m pleased, because it\u2019s that generation that I feel very sorry for.\u201d Paul Cargill, 35, simply said he felt \u201cdespair\u201d. \u201cWhen did we stop caring about the people around us?\u201d he asked. Distrust of the media was a recurrent theme, with the fear of fake news leaving people unsure which sources they could consider reliable. Many said they used Twitter as their primary news source, which offers quick access to breaking news. \u201cI do think there\u2019s a huge problem with a lot of publications and news outlets,\u201d said Bryony, 26, from Salford. \u201cWith Facebook, a lot of the articles shared have fake news on them, and the websites look very professional and mislead people. Headlines are misleading too \u2013 often they aren\u2019t specifically lying, but they\u2019re very misleading.\u201d Facebook launched its fact-checking tools in the UK in January, when it partnered with Full Fact to give the charity access to a service that allows it to mark stories as true, false, satire, and so on. News marked as false is given reduced distribution on the platform, but Facebook has come under fire for refusing to allow Full Fact to do the same fact-checking on politicians\u2019 statements and adverts on the platform. Bryony felt that this election was much worse than others, and said this was largely due to Brexit. \u201cI watch news, read news, listen to news \u2026 It\u2019s never bothered me before. But with Brexit, it\u2019s the same old drivel, and I find it so depressing. With other elections you expected some tit-for-tat, but with this election there\u2019s something [depressing] every day.\u201d Annie Hassall, a 20-year-old student at the University of Worcester, said she felt she needed to question whether you can believe what you\u2019re reading. \u201cI think it certainly contributes to the anxiety, because you\u2019re not sure you can trust what you\u2019re reading. There are so many sources and you don\u2019t know which are affiliated to which political party, and which are trustworthy.\u201d For many people who contacted the Guardian, the disillusionment with news and current affairs led to feelings of apathy and disillusionment, as they failed to find politicians who represented them, or who they felt could deliver on promises. Some said the stress of current affairs had a direct impact on their physical wellbeing. One 72-year-old reader said they could not watch news channels or listen to news on the radio because it caused a spike in blood pressure. For others, however, the political landscape provided a call to arms, and many readers of all ages said they felt motivated to act. At the age of 75, Haskell recently decided to join the Liberal Democrats, and she and her husband remain involved in local council issues. Hassall said she had recently joined the Labour party. \u201cI just thought, I can\u2019t sit and watch this and not try to have some sort of effect. I can\u2019t just let it happen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
