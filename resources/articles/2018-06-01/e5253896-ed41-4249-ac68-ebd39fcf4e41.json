She was one of dozens of women harmed by Emil Shawky Gayed, who over the course of at least one decade mutilated and performed harmful surgery on patients. Health authorities fear there may be many more women still to come forward. The chief medical officer of the Manning Rural Referral hospital in Taree, Dr Osama Ali, confirmed that the woman had died this year. This follows an investigation by Guardian Australia that revealed Gayed needlessly removed women\u2019s reproductive organs. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Five years ago, tests ordered by Gayed showed the woman had endometrial hyperplasia, an overgrowth of uterine lining that can progress to or be a sign of cancer. After discovering the hyperplasia Gayed performed endometrial ablation surgery on the woman, which removes and destroys layers of the uterus. Ali said ablation should never be performed on women with hyperplasia because scarring from the procedure can mask cancer growth, and trigger the development of cancerous cells. In February this year the woman returned to the hospital\u2019s emergency department with heavy vaginal bleeding. Doctors found she had uterine cancer. \u201cBy the time she came back to us in February she had cancer,\u201d Ali said. \u201cWe treated her, and unfortunately, she passed away.\u201d The woman was told about Gayed\u2019s error before she died and received counselling and support. The Hunter New England health district and the hospital are in the process of meeting her relatives to offer counselling and explain their legal options. Ali has reviewed Gayed\u2019s clinical notes for all other ablation procedures he performed at the hospital over the past decade. He identified nine more women who are are at high risk of harm because they received ablation and had hyperplasia. While their risk of cancer varies, Ali said there was a \u201chigh chance\u201d of cancer in three of the women and a \u201clow risk\u201d in the remaining six. Ali contacted all of the women last week and they are returning to the hospital for biopsies. Ali also found that Gayed performed ablation procedures between 50% and 60% more frequently than other gynaecologists at the hospital. The woman\u2019s death follows an investigation by the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) which found that Gayed inappropriately treated seven women, including performing an unnecessary hysterectomy on one and removing the healthy fallopian tube of another. As a result, the NSW civil and administrative tribunal found Gayed guilty of professional misconduct earlier in June, and barred him from practising medicine for three years. Ali said Gayed should be banned for life. \u201cI would stand him down for life,\u201d Ali said. \u201cI investigated all of this, I\u2019m in the heart of it, and I feel that at least banning him from registration in Australia for life would be the minimum these ladies should get as an outcome. Three years is not good enough.\u201d Gayed resigned from the Manning Rural Referral hospital, which is a public hospital, in February 2016, months after the HCCC alerted him that he was under investigation. Five weeks after he resigned, restrictions were placed on him by health authorities, barring him from performing major surgeries. He continued to practise in his own private rooms in Taree as well as in Dee Why and Mona Vale in Sydney. He then abandoned his private clinics and relinquished his registration before the HCCC investigation was complete, though he will be eligible to apply for reregistration once his ban expires in 2021. The website of his Dee Why practice says he has \u201cretired\u201d. Gayed now lives in Sydney. He has not returned calls from Guardian Australia. Ali said Gayed has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. \u201cWe have put forward the allegations and complaints we got, and he looked at them and he defended every single one of them,\u201d Ali said. \u201cHe says, \u2018This wasn\u2019t the case, this wasn\u2019t intentional,\u2019 or he comes up with a conclusion that it\u2019s not his fault. The more you look into it there is more to it, in terms of his personality and the damage he has created.\u201d Ali urged any women who believed they had been mistreated by Gayed to call the hospital, and their cases would be reviewed. \u201cIt is our task now to try and rebuild the trust in the community and at the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should not have happened and we are here to address what happened and provide those women with the best care.\u201d The chief executive of the Hunter New England health district, Michael DiRienzo, also said Gayed should be banned for life. He said the hospital and the health district were not aware Gayed was problematic until receiving notice from the HCCC that he was under investigation in 2015. DiRienzo said the majority of additional cases had come to light after Gayed resigned from the hospital and then closed down his private clinics. Several of his private patients then went to Manning hospital for treatment instead, where doctors identified problems in the way they had been cared for by Gayed. But those women were now struggling to obtain their medical records from Gayed, DiRienzo said. \u201cI\u2019m really worried that a lot of women went through his private rooms and a lot of that medical information remains with him, we don\u2019t have it,\u201d DiRienzo said. \u201cWhat we do have is information for some of the women who also came through our emergency departments and operating theatres and received treatment from him there, where we were able to gather information.\u201d The HCCC investigation revealed that Gayed kept poor medical records. Procedures and complications that should have been recorded and reported were not, the investigation found. The scandal also raises questions about how those who worked with Gayed did not notice his errors or question unnecessary surgeries and report him earlier. The president of the Medical Error Action Group, Lorraine Long, told Guardian Australia that she had written to the then NSW health minister John Hatzistergos about Gayed in 2006 because her organisation had received so many serious complaints about him. But DiRienzo said the hospital had reviewed its database and annual performance reviews for Gayed, and no issues had been recorded or raised until 2015. \u201cThe issue is we is we don\u2019t know how many women have been affected by him at the moment ... it is a terrible thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI am deeply sorry for what they\u2019re going through. We will do all we can to identify and support support women and to provide any additional information to the HCCC.\u201d Do you know more?
