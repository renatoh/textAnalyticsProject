Support seemed to be slipping from his grasp almost before he had uttered a word. When Marland's candidature was revealed on Saturday night, some calculations claimed that he could count on nine of the 18 votes. An updated count by The Guardian yesterday put that figure no higher than six, with Clarke holding up to 11 promises \u2013 albeit some less reliable than others. Marland, a 52-year-old millionaire financier, was one of the brains behind Boris Johnson's defeat of Ken Livingstone in the London mayoral election. He might yet have to ask Boris to return the favour. Clarke, cricket's most confrontational figure, spent yesterday overseeing a conference into the future of Test cricket, but as he addressed the very county delegates who will determine his survival in a shock election next month his thoughts must have strayed to the future of himself. While he theorised about Test cricket, Lord Marland fired the first shots by calling Clarke's ECB \"a shambles\" and accusing the governing body of \"systematic failure\" for contriving to sack a coach, Peter Moores, and captain, Kevin Pietersen, on the same day nearly a fortnight ago. He concluded by terming England's performance since winning the 2005 Ashes \"dire\". Clarke remained relaxed and non-committal \u2013 emotions that are quite uncommon to him \u2013 as he addressed both supporters and conspirators, led by the Hampshire chairman, Rod Bransgrove, in Leicestershire's Stapleford Park Country House Hotel. It was here that the ECB chairman, David Collier, proposed marriage; it was here yesterday that Clarke feared divorce from the ECB. Outside this rural hotel, sheep graze in the field, but inside no one was quite sure if the delegates were prepared to be led so easily. As county chairmen gossiped for more information about the Lord who would end Clarke's influential two-year reign, his chairing of the sports lobby group Nexus began to attract attention. It was Nexus which in 2005 supported the move to a \"smaller number of elite teams\". Neil Davidson, chairman of one of the most vulnerable, Leicestershire, and who has been one of Lord Marland's most vocal supporter, must have blanched at that discovery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
