I am absolutely not planning to leave. The army did not come today. Yesterday, about 200 of us went to the gate [at the settlement's entrance] early in the morning to stop the army [from entering to deliver notices ordering the settlers to leave by today]. But after a couple of hours we decided it was better to let the soldiers in so they could see our suffering, see what it is they are being asked to take from their homes. I came back to the house to wait for them. About seven soldiers came to my door at about 1pm - soldiers, not policemen, because I wouldn't let policemen into my house - but we told them we couldn't take the papers because we were all crying. They didn't say anything because I asked them not to. I told them: \"Thank-you but a Jewish soul can't do this to another Jewish soul.\" I wanted them to see my family, who we are. My wife and children were at my side. We were all crying. My seven-year-old son knew exactly what was happening. We have been praying a lot. I don't know what the soldiers thought but I do not think they were happy. I will go to bed tonight - I don't see any reason to keep vigil. We expect the army to come tomorrow to torment us. We've made preparations, but I don't think I'd like to discuss them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
