Not the essential task of healing a divided nation, or the critical need to negotiate in the nation\u2019s long-term strategic interest, but Theresa May\u2019s increasingly desperate attempts to keep her party\u2019s hardline Eurosceptics onside. The end of May\u2019s leadership of the Conservative party has not marked the end of this period in which Tory splits, rather than the national interest, have driven the governing party\u2019s approach to the most important question postwar Britain has faced. On the contrary, it has moved into an even more toxic phase. Brexit may be dominating the race to succeed her, but even those leadership candidates who are subjecting themselves to the scrutiny of media interviews and lengthy question-and-answer sessions are not engaged in a conversation with the British public. Despite the fact they are competing to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister, the rules of the leadership selection process mean they are immersed in a far more insular dialogue \u2013 with the tiny proportion of the electorate who are members of the Conservative party. Just as May refused to level with the public about the painful tradeoffs involved in Brexit, instead churning out disingenuous platitudes to appease the fanatic Eurosceptics in her party, most of those engaged in the race to succeed her are saying precisely what they think Conservative party members will want to hear. So, as the clock ticks down to 31 October, the political conversation about Brexit is playing out in a bubble wholly removed from reality. Those hoping to succeed May are simply pretending that the constraints she operated under will magically evaporate once they move into Number 10. Despite Jean-Claude Juncker reiterating last week that there is no scope to reopen the withdrawal agreement, five out of the six remaining candidates say their preferred outcome is a renegotiated withdrawal agreement that removes the backstop. Those same five candidates have refused to rule out a catastrophic no-deal outcome, while one, Dominic Raab, has said that if necessary he would prorogue parliament to prevent it blocking Britain from leaving with no deal. What this means is that, come late July, Britain will in all likelihood have a prime minister who has promised colleagues he can in a few short weeks extract major concessions from the EU that May failed to over a period of months and who may very well be willing to crash Britain out of the EU without a deal. This would make the role of parliament absolutely pivotal. But last week, MPs wasted a crucial opportunity to seize control of the parliamentary agenda in order to try to prevent a no-deal scenario. There were enough Conservative rebels who voted for the motion to pass, were it not for eight Labour MPs who voted against their party\u2019s motion. If Britain ends up leaving without a deal, which will be to the greatest detriment of the least affluent areas of the nation, a heavy burden should weigh on their consciences. Beyond Brexit, the leadership candidates have had nothing to say in terms of a positive vision for the country. They have revealed worryingly little detail about their policy platforms, although it is revealing that the key ground over which they have chosen to compete is on tax cuts. Austerity was a political choice spearheaded by David Cameron and George Osborne and later enthusiastically embraced by May. As successive Tory chancellors have delivered tax cuts worth billions of pounds a year to businesses and more affluent households, public services have been starved of cash and tax credits and benefits for low-income families with children have been slashed, leaving some thousands of pounds a year worse off. Yet many of the candidates to succeed May would move the Conservatives even further to the right, prioritising more expensive and regressive tax cuts at the expense of restoring some spending on schools, hospitals and policing. Boris Johnson would give high earners on \u00a380,000 a \u00a33,000 a year tax cut; Raab would cut the basic rate of income tax by an eye-watering 5p; Jeremy Hunt would further cut corporation tax from 19% to 12.5%, despite the fact that it has already been significantly slashed from 28% since 2010. None has said how this would be paid for or what sort of level of further cuts to health, care and education services this would imply. These leadership candidates are competing to make the Tory party nastier: they stand for a smaller state, higher poverty and greater inequality. It is also an utter indictment on the state of the modern Conservative party that Boris Johnson should, after the first round of voting by MPs, be so far in the lead. It is a mark of desperation that so many MPs are rallying around a candidate with such an appalling track record as foreign secretary; who fronted false assertions on behalf of the Leave campaign, including the misleading claim that leaving the EU would free up \u00a3350m a week to spend on the NHS, and stoking fears that Turkey was about to join the EU, which he has since lied about doing. That Tory MPs should view someone of such feeble character a potential electoral lifeline speaks volumes about the party\u2019s medium-term prospects. There is no hope of Brexit getting resolved through an insular leadership contest in which candidates are making foolish promises to a tiny, unrepresentative slice of the electorate. Labour must unreservedly throw its support behind a referendum on any Brexit deal and forge a path towards it. The country\u2019s future must not be allowed to lie in the hands of 160,000 disproportionately Eurosceptic, affluent and rightwing Conservative members. Only Labour is in a position to ensure that all voters get their right to have a say."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
