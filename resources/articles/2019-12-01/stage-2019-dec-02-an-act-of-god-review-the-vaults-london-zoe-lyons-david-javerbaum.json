In the US, its lead role was taken by camp sitcom stars Jim Parsons and Sean Hayes. Now standup Zoe Lyons plays the capricious Almighty who, when asked why there is no consistent justice in her world, barks: \u201cI prefer mysterious ways!\u201d Although described as a \u201cone-God show\u201d, Lyons \u2013 in silk pyjamas on Tim Shortall\u2019s heavenly king-size bed set \u2013 is joined by buff Tom Bowen as archangel Gabriel, reciting verses from a Gutenberg Bible. In the auditorium, archangel Michael (Matt Tedford) solicits audience questions, before staging a minor rebellion and venturing niggling doubts of his own. Playwright David Javerbaum\u2019s iconography \u2013 messianic woman, two camp angels \u2013 brings to mind Lucy McCormick\u2019s hit show Triple Threat, next to which Act of God feels tame. It starts frothily, as louche Lyons reveals the same-sex truth about Ada and Eve, and tries to excuse the biblical flood: \u201cIt drowned me more than it drowned you.\u201d There are divine one-liners: the show is more quotable than the good book itself. There are topical asides, too \u2013 on Brexit, on Prince Andrew \u2013 in a show Javerbaum has adjusted for UK audiences. There\u2019s a final-act gear change, as God (and the play) gets a bit pious about Jesus, and volunteers belated penitence for her behaviour. (\u201cIncompetence and omnipotence is a recipe for disaster.\u201d) Javerbaum\u2019s satiric point \u2013 that the Old Testament God is a psychopath, who we\u2019d be better off without \u2013 might create a frisson in the States. To British audiences, it feels less of a Revelation. But it\u2019s funny \u2013 as you\u2019d expect from a writer whose 13 Emmys are mostly for comedy writing. Everyday and biblical idiom are spliced to droll effect; attention is amusingly drawn (if seldom for the first time) to God\u2019s moral illogic and scriptural credibility gaps wider than the parting of the Red Sea. It trips along enjoyably in Benji Sperring\u2019s production \u2013 but it\u2019s more sweet breeze than thunderbolt. \u2022 At the Vaults, London, until 12 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
