The Scottish international made one goal, scored the winner and could have had several more as he caused panic throughout the game against the Premiership newcomers. And although the midlands side were not at full strength McFadden and of his team-mates will take great confidence from the result. It was the home side that got off to an impressive start by taking the lead after only seven minutes. McFadden left four Birmingham players stranded on the left touchline before squaring the ball across the box for an unmarked Derek Adams to slot home from 12 yards out. But only four minutes later the visitors equalised after Motherwell keeper Stevie Woods had blocked a Stern John drive to the feet of the oncoming Paul Devlin who had the easiest of tasks to knock in from close range. McFadden regained the lead for the Lanarkshire men in the 25th minute when he capitalised on a Michael Johnson mistake to go through and chip stranded Birmingham keeper Ian Bennett. At the other end Damien Johnson missed a decent chance to equalise when he shot over from 16 yards after John had cleverly set him up. McFadden should have made it three for the home side after only a minute of the second half but somehow blasted over the bar from only four yards out with Bennett lying stranded. The game had been played in the right spirit with both sides attacking at every opportunity and entertaining the small crowd of 2293. Birmingham knocked the ball about well at times but could not penetrate the Motherwell rearguard. In the 57th minute Birmingham sub Brian Hughes, on for Graham Hyde minutes earlier, came close with a chip from the edge of the box which floated only inches past Woods' left hand post. On the hour McFadden drew a great save from Bennett with a close-range header which the keeper did well to tip over the bar for a corner. In the 69th minute ex-Celtic defender Olivier Tebily should have scored from a Martin Grainger corner but headed past the post from only six yards out. GVV Veenendal 0 - 4 Newcastle United Hugo Viana grabbed two goals as Newcastle cruised to a 4-0 win on the third leg of their tour of Holland. The \u00a38.5million close-season signing from Sporting Lisbon found the back of the net in the 25th and 38th minutes to cap an impressive display. Kieron Dyer, starting up front alongside Shola Ameobi, had given Bobby Robson's men the lead in the 11th minute with a cool side-footed finish. Viana made it two from Dyer's centre and the duo repeated the trick for the third soon after. Two minutes before half-time Laurent Robert claimed his fourth of the tour with a classy chip. Stevenage 1 - 2 Charlton A rare Luke Young goal maintained Charlton's unbeaten start to their pre-season at Stevenage Borough. The home side went in front just before the break through Jean-Michel Signer, but the Addicks, who made 11 substitutions at half-time, levelled through Scott Parker shortly after the break. And Young grabbed the winner 15 minutes from time. Oxford 1 - 3 Chelsea Chelsea enjoyed a comfortable win over Oxford at the Kassam Stadium. Gianfranco Zola opened the scoring after nine minutes but Dean Whitehead levelled with an excellent free-kick. Philippe Oliveira put the Blues back in front soon after with an superb strike and youngster Rob Wolleaston made it three in the second half."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
