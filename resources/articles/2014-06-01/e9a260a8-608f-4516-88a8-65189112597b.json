Tea Party-aligned Republicans were adamant that Cantor\u2019s primary loss on Tuesday to David Brat, a virtually unknown university professor, justified a new majority leader from the conservative wing of the party. The job that Cantor is leaving is the second-most powerful in the House, and the contest over his replacement \u2013 who will be elected on on 19 June \u2013 is already laying bare the GOP's divisions. Immigration reform, an issue which is believed to have contributed heavily to Cantor\u2019s defeat, is already shaping up to be a significant component of the contest over his succession. The party establishment is rallying behind Kevin McCarthy, whose current job, chief whip, is the third most senior role in the House, making him the obvious heir apparent. McCarthy spent much of Wednesday stomping through the halls of the Capitol Building openly rallying support for his candidacy, although he has yet to formally announce he will stand. Conservative elements in the GOP, buoyed by Cantor\u2019s astonishing defeat, are determined to block McCarthy\u2019s promotion. When, on Wednesday afternoon, he announced his plans to stand down from his leadership role before the end of July, Cantor left no doubt who he supported. \u201cIf my dear friend and colleague Kevin McCarthy does decide to run I think he would make an outstanding majority leader,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be backing him with my full support.\u201d Cantor spoke to reporters immediately after announcing his departure to at a specially-convened meeting of the Republican caucus. Sources inside the closed-door meeting said Cantor received five standing ovations and was given an emotional embrace by House speaker John Boehner, who was in tears. Republicans who oppose the existing leadership in the House are rallying around two anti-immigration congressmen \u2013 both Texans \u2013 who are considering taking on McCarthy, who is from California. One is Pete Sessions, chair of the House Rules Committee, who Republican sources said had spent much of the day frantically courting support. The other is Jeb Hensarling, whom Tea Party-aligned congressmen appeared to be coalescing around. \"I think this administration needs to be prodded and reminded that the entire sovereignty of the United States is at risk of we do not secure our border, north, south, east and west,\u201d Sessions told reporters as he arrived at the Republican House meeting. \u201cAnd the things which are occurring at our border must be stopped and must be controlled before we do anything else that encourages people to come here.\" The Texas delegation, which comprises 24 members \u2013 a major voting bloc \u2013 is signalling it will vote en masse in the leadership election, potentially helping ensure a southern conservative wins the post. Texas Republicans convened late Wednesday to decide on a coherent strategy and there was some pressure on Sessions and Hensarling to reach an agreement on who out of the two would run. Sessions described Hensarling as a \u201cdear friend\u201d and confirmed the pair would be meeting. Asked if one would have to step aside, he replied: \"Let's see what happens. I think we work very well together.\" Tellingly, Boehner has not taken sides in the race, and gave no indication of his preference during the closed-doors session. Partly that was to rise above the fray but also, Republican sources said, because he would support McCarthy, and McCarthy\u2019s victory is no certainty. Tim Huelskamp, a Kansas representative reputed to be something of a Tea Party kingmaker in the House, told the Guardian that Boehner\u2019s refusal to take sides was \u201ca sign of weakness.\u201d \u201cThe idea that Kevin McCarthy would just move on up suggests that, no, the leadership doesn't get it,\u201d he said. \u201cSuccessions and dynasties is the way the establishment has worked for a long time in Washington but the American people, particularly in the heart of the Republican Party, will not be satisfied with putting another guy in the position to do the same old thing.\" There was a sense among right-wingers in the party that Cantor\u2019s defeat justified some kind of reward from the party leadership. Justin Amash, from Michigan, another Tea Party-aligned representative, said that Hensarling winning the majority leader post was the only way Boehner could avoid a concerted challenge to his own position as speaker after the midterm elections. If McCarthy or Sessions win, Amash said, \u201cit is very likely that conservatives and libertarians within the conference will again make an attempt to change leadership\u201d. \u201cThe only way in which Boehner is not vulnerable is if Jeb Hensarling is majority leader,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
