The announcement represents another reversal by the government. At the time of the G20 meeting last month the prime minister resisted mounting global pressure to commit to the fund, designed to help poor countries adapt to climate change. He argued Australia was already spending $2.5bn on its domestic Direct Action fund and providing $10bn in capital to a so-called \u201cgreen bank\u201d \u2013 which he is trying to abolish. The change of position was announced on Tuesday, as foreign minister Julie Bishop prepared to address the United Nations conference on climate change in Lima \u2013 a meeting the prime minister\u2019s office initially refused to allow her to attend. Abbott and Bishop made the announcement in a joint statement. \u201cThe pledge to the Green Climate Fund will facilitate private sector-led economic growth in the Indo-Pacific region with a particular focus on investment in infrastructure, energy, forestry ... and emissions reduction programmes.\u201d The pledge brought an immediate burst of applause at the UN conference. \u201cWe have a strong track record in delivering climate finance,\u201d Julie Bishop told the room. Speaking to reporters in Melbourne, Abbott admitted he had \u201cmade various comments some time ago\u201d about the fund but said \u201cas we\u2019ve seen things develop over the last few months\u201d it was now appropriate for Australia to make \u201ca modest, prudent and proportional commitment\u201d in the interests of being a \u201cgood international citizen\u201d. \u201cThat money will be strictly invested in practical projects in our region,\u201d he said. Asked about the fund before last year\u2019s UN climate meeting in Warsaw, the prime minister said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be making any contributions to that.\u201d It was reported that at one of its first cabinet meetings the Abbott government decided it would make no contributions to the fund. At the time the prime minister compared it to a domestic fund championed by the former Greens leader Bob Brown, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which Abbott wants to abolish. He told the Australian: \u201cOne thing the current government will never do is say one thing at home and a different thing abroad. We are committed to dismantling the Bob Brown bank at home so it would be impossible for us to support a Bob Brown bank on an international scale.\u201d The government also pointedly dissented from support for the fund in a communique from last November\u2019s Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting \u2013 a stance backed by Canada. Canada also recently announced it would now be contribute to the fund. The announcement also revealed that the prime minister\u2019s department would take over the development of any post-2020 emissions reduction targets that Australia might make before next year\u2019s United Nations climate talks in Paris. It said the review would take into consideration action by the world\u2019s developed economies and Australia\u2019s major trading partners. \u201cAny new post-2020 target would be announced in mid-2015 after the taskforce has completed its work,\u201d it said. Campaign groups broadly welcomed the shift in position - but still said that Australia could afford to do more. \u201cThis can only be called a first step and falls short of its fair share,\u201d said Kelly Dent, a campaigner for Oxfam Australia. Still, she said: \u201cAustralia\u2019s pledge, just days after reports that they would not contribute to the fund, is an important message of support and a recognition of the country\u2019s responsibility to act.\u201d The Climate Institute think tank welcomed the Australian contribution as \u201cthe first step towards fair and proper financial support for poor and vulnerable countries responding to the climate challenge\u201d. It said the amount fell short of the $350m a year the institute believed was a fair contribution from Australia. \u201cHowever, the government has an opportunity to demonstrate its total climate finance contribution when it submits its plan to scale up climate finance to the international community early next year. \u201cAs part of this process, the government should outline how this contribution is in addition to the existing activities it is taking through the aid program and other bilateral activities.\u201d The Australian Conservation Foundation said the contribution was welcome, but the money should be in addition to the existing aid budget. The G20 communique urged countries to make contributions to the fund \u2013 although the language was initially resisted by Australia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
