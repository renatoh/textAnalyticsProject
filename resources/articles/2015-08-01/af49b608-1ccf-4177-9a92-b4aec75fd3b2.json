Comments 165 entries, a few with KAYAK/MYOSIN for KAIAK/VIOLIN (which must have been pure guesswork) and a few more offering clues with omission of the wrong letter. For such a \u2018milestone\u2019 puzzle I was hoping that the entry would be bigger, but perhaps less experienced solvers were daunted by the theme. This received general approval \u2013 just as well since the idea took ages to gestate \u2013 and I was much heartened by the many complimentary comments. It was only after completing the grid that I noticed that there were no unchecked letters in the clue word, and that therefore, strictly speaking, it did not require to be \u2018deduced\u2019, but I decided, rightly as it turned out, that no one would pick me up on this. (One regular competitor, having got to M_L_STONE, became concerned that it was going to be MY LAST ONE, an Araucaria-style announcement of my imminent retirement!) Asking you to devise clues that made sense with and without the missing O presented a tough extra challenge, one I had decide to set myself early on in the cluing process. It just seemed more satisfyingly elegant and I certainly don\u2019t regret making this stipulation, though some overlooked it, or perhaps simply gave up the struggle. The most popular \u2018doctored\u2019 words were P(O)INT (which I had used myself in the clue to PARAMO, albeit with a different sense of \u2018point\u2019), and T(O)ASTED/T(O)ASTING, but you cleverly found plenty of others, many of them featured above. Favourite among my own clues, of no fewer than 20 receiving mention, was \u2018Luther might have fashioned this blend of oil in wine\u2019 (VIOLIN). \u2018Luthier\u2019 was, I admit, a happy find. Another milestone reached and passed, then. The celebratory lunch at Wolfson College was a splendid occasion, organized with great efficiency by Will Drever. It was a real pleasure for me to meet and chat to so many old friends. The meal was first-rate, followed by a fascinating speech by John Tozer in which he talked about aspects of the task he\u2019d recently completed of adding all the Ximenes slips to his andlit.org website. I also spoke, mainly to thank everyone who had helped to arrange the celebration. The handover of the silver salver from Jeremy Morse to Mark Barley followed, as mentioned in the previous slip, with both of them speaking about the special nature of the Azed series, and Richard Heald then handed over the monthly cup to Mick Hodgkin. To round off the proceedings I was presented with a framed poem based on MMCCL written and recited by John Burscough, and a recently-published collection of limericks (subtitled A History of the World in 100 Limericks) by Mick Hodgkin, inscribed with one \u2018To Azed\u2019. The assembled company then repaired to our house nearby, whereby Mrs AZ (Alison) had laid on a sumptuous tea party. The sun shone throughout \u2013the perfect end to a perfect day. Further details are accessible on the andlit.org.uk website. Onward, then, to No. 2,500."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
