The tracklist features 11 diverse originals and a traditional theme by Turkey\u2019s legendary minstrel Asik Veysel. Tranquil, floating melodies over soft strumming \u2013 as on the quietly wayward The Followers \u2013 represent Oxley and Meier in relaxed conversational mode; Looking West, Tales and Libra are rhapsodic ballads that develop along Django Reinhardt or Pat Metheny lines. The Metheny influence shows up in its fusion guise on the pulsating track The Bridge, which combines the American\u2019s synth-guitar sound and the brittle tones of the glissentar. There are breezy Latin dances, music with strong Turkish inflections. The funky, closely-entwined Breezin\u2019 On is a standout, and Bluster is a brightly devious walking blues. This invitingly song-based repertoire stretches wide enough to engage listeners beyond the coterie of jazz guitar fans. Oxley and Meier can be heard on their extended tour of the UK."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
