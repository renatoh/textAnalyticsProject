The Chelsea and England No 10 \u2013 once described as her country\u2019s Mini Messi \u2013 was also suffering stabbing chest pains, breathlessness, nausea and dizziness. Medics feared her career could be over. \u201cI was extremely vulnerable and very poorly for a long time,\u201d says Kirby, looking a picture of health while addressing a computer screen in the first-floor bedroom she no longer struggles to reach. The creator whose attacking promptings are expected to provide plenty of goals for Chelsea\u2019s new \u00a3300,000 signing, Pernille Harder, had contracted a virus that attacked her heart. It was last November and Europe remained blissfully unaware of Covid-19 when a different infection took an unfortunate shine to Kirby, causing her to develop pericarditis. Possibly the only good news was that, in Emma Hayes, Kirby had a manager prepared to go the extra mile to support a 27-year-old whose teenage years were scarred by severe depression, occasioned by her mother\u2019s death. \u201cWhen I wasn\u2019t feeling great I could just go into Emma\u2019s office, cry in front of her and not feel embarrassed,\u201d says Kirby. \u201cEmma\u2019s been incredible. She\u2019s been my rock; the person who made sure I was protected from everything. I had no idea what the illness was but she was the one questioning the doctor all the time, asking: \u2018Can we try this, can we try that?\u2019 It meant so much. I\u2019m never going to be not grateful for what people have done for me these last few months \u2013 Chelsea\u2019s doctor was incredible and my teammates were amazing \u2013 but Emma\u2019s top of that list: 100%.\u201d As Kirby jokes about her long hair and reveals she has not had it trimmed once since the European Championship in the Netherlands in 2017, it is hard to credit that concern about her condition was such that Chelsea kept the pericarditis diagnosis secret until February. Yet as soon as she started going outside again, the pandemic struck. \u201cI\u2019d had three months prep for it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d been in self-isolation long before everyone went into lockdown.\u201d Now, finally, the Women\u2019s Super League is set to resume with Chelsea \u2013 awarded the title ahead of Manchester City on a points per game basis following last season\u2019s curtailment in March \u2013 kicking off at Manchester United today. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good to get the buzz back,\u201d says Kirby. \u201cThe last nine months have made me realise how precious these moments, these games, are. And how you should never take things for granted. I\u2019m really excited. I\u2019ve found a new energy for everything. Most importantly, I\u2019ve found myself again. I\u2019ve learned a lot about myself and the people around me and how important they are. It\u2019s been a tough journey but it\u2019s definitely shaped me into who I am now.\u201d Kirby \u2013 dubbed \u201cour Mini Messi\u201d by the-then England manager Mark Sampson at the 2015 World Cup in Canada and an international whom the outgoing England coach, Phil Neville, has said he would not swap for Brazil\u2019s much-lauded Marta \u2013 believes she has emerged a much-improved player. \u201cIf I\u2019m honest, I feel better now,\u2019 she says. \u201cI\u2019ve come back in really good shape and I\u2019ve been getting some really positive feedback from the coaches and the girls. They\u2019re saying it\u2019s like having a new signing. \u201cFor the past few months I\u2019ve been entirely focused on how I can improve. Although there was a period when the cardiologist told me that, if I didn\u2019t slow down, the illness could become chronic and I wouldn\u2019t be able to play again, I knew I was going to get over it. Getting a starting place here now is super-competitive but I like to push myself, to be a winner.\u201d Given Chelsea\u2019s formidable squad, such a mindset seems imperative. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of players, full internationals, on the bench who won\u2019t be happy,\u201d says Kirby, who has an ambitious, between-the-lines playing style. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very competitive atmosphere but, as a squad, we\u2019re good at dealing with happiness and disappointment. No one\u2019s shouting or bragging because they\u2019re starting or moping around because they\u2019re not. Of course you have to focus on yourself as an individual but, as a team, we\u2019re very good at taking time out to speak to other players, making sure they\u2019re OK. To win things, you need that balance.\u201d Last winter Kirby\u2019s teammates proved critical to the maintenance of her emotional equilibrium. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to get out the house much at first,\u201d she says. \u201cI was sofa-ridden for a couple of months but the girls always made an effort to come round, even if I wasn\u2019t in the shape for conversation. That meant everything. Now I want to help them win every game, every trophy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
