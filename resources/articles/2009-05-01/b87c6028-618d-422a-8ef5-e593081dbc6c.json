Philippe Schoeller's The Eyes of the Wind is the least convincing work here: a parade of superficially arresting effects with little substance. But the single-movement work by Bruno Mantovani and the seven-movement concerto by Gilbert Amy are both worthwhile. Mantovani's music is hardly known on this side of the Channel; in France he is one of the leading younger composers, and this concerto, for which Schumann's cello concerto was apparently the model, is an impressively sustained piece, growing organically from a scatter of short motives into a more sustained and imposing argument. Amy's work, completed in 2000, is very different - a succession of short movements adding up to far more than the sum of its parts, in which an exotic array of percussion vies for attention with the soloist. In all three pieces, Queyras is wonderfully committed; he is a player who has the priceless knack of making second-rate music punch far above its weight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
