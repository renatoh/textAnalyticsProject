While Heinz-Harald Frentzen was guiding his Sauber around the circuit at Magny-Cours, his 14-year-old sister Nicole-Nadine was taking their mother's Mercedes for an unauthorised spin around the streets of M\u00f6nchengladbach. Nicole-Nadine was detained by police after she was caught driving the car with her 11-year-old sister Samantha and a 12-year-old friend as passengers, a spokesman for police in the western German city said. Her parents were watching the grand prix on television at the time. \"We got a call from a driver who saw the under-aged girl driving and a police car was dispatched to investigate,\" the spokesman said yesterday. \"She was stopped and faces charges of driving without a licence. Thank God nothing happened.\" Her father, Heinrich-Harald, said although he was angry at his teenaged daughter he could understand why she did it. \"She has petrol in her blood,\" he said. \"She already takes part in kart-racing and regularly beats the boys. When she has her driving licence maybe she will try out for formula BMW. That would be the next step towards formula one.\" Nicole-Nadine, however, faces a four-year wait before she can obtain a driving licence. Heinrich-Harald Frentzen said sibling rivalry was not new in formula one but brother-sister duels were. \"We have already seen sufficient clashes between brothers - but brother against sister, that would be something.\" Although the younger generation of Frentzens clearly share a penchant for high-speed driving their father is used to travelling at a slower pace. He is a funeral director."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
