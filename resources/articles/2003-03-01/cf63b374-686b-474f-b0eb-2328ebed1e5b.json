After all, the government is backing a merged ITV via the communications bill, isn't it? Well, not quite. There is a two-track approach under way. The government is relaxing media ownership controls, but it is also keeping a toughened competition regime in place at the same time. It is instructive to turn back to the previous ITV inquiry in 2000, when the commission blocked an outright merger of Carlton with United News &amp; Media, handing Granada the prized Meridian franchise. The regulator found then that ITV was an unsubstitutable medium. In other words, if you want to boost sales of your Sunday tabloid newspaper, ITV is the only place to reach a mass audience fast, on a Saturday night. Has that special power changed in three years? Not really. Despite the buzz last November about the IPA's Effectiveness Awards being \"media neutral\", the big winners were Sainsbury's Jamie Oliver campaign, \"A Recipe for Success\", and Walker's Crisps. And what did the judges say? \"This is a valuable lesson of the power of great television advertising, and how well television advertising can work using celebrity.\" Furthermore, the current merger proposal has clearly gone forward without any formal assurances from Granada or Carlton to create two advertising sales houses. That's despite the fact that it would place the lucrative London ITV airtime market under one roof. Granada and Carlton are pinning their arguments on the Barb ratings system and published airtime spot prices, which they say will deliver a transparent market where abuses can be spotted. From Carlton and Granada's viewpoint there seems no point in merging if, in the crucial area of income generation, they are condemned to fight a phoney war until their combined 54% share of the ad market has sufficiently collapsed. Especially when the advantage of marketing itself as a unified brand to advertisers is working quite well. But the opponents - Channel 4, Channel Five, BSkyB and Flextech's IDS sales house - view the merger in a gritty way. They expect it to harm them. They ask a down to earth question: will a merged Granada/Carlton win the same advertising share as they do when in competition with us, a bit less, or a bit more? The opponents say that even if a merged operation wins just one percentage point more of the total cake, that is too much. Channel 4 has already proved it is anxious about ITV's bully boy ability to vacuum up ad revenue. Last summer it asked the competition commission to intervene over the network's four-year \u00a3340m deal with Unilever. So far this year, ITV's schedule has had a swagger to it - from a revived Coronation Street, to Martin Bashir's interview with Michael Jackson, and the current triumph of Cold Feet - even if the attempt to improve daytime with a revamped Crossroads has flopped. The impact of an extra \u00a3100m for programming to June 2003 is being carefully spelt out in a detail never before available. ITV is starting to market CITV children's programmes - beginning with Girls in Love, sponsored by Wella - as big brands. Overall it suggests Granada and Carlton are preparing to haggle as hard as they can, in a tough haul lasting all summer. And as happened three years ago, the outcome is unlikely to deliver all they want."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
