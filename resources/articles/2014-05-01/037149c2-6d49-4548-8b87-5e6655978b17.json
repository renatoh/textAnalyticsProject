Night, and thanks all for your company. Any ideas what we're all meant to do tomorrow? Also: Selby is clearly a boss. It's really not easy to quantify the magnitude of Selby's achievement. O'Sullivan beat Higgins to 14 in his first final, in 2001, then walloped whoever had the misfortune to encounter him at that stage subsequently. Over the longer form, the idea anyone could grind him out of the match seems ridiculous. And here we are. The referee receives a pair of \"solid gold cufflinks\". What if he thinks cufflinks are for ponces? Unlike John Higgins, Selby doesn't need prompting from Hazel to become emotional about a family loss. He then says that, after a hard season, he found something just before the championships. Yes he did. Selby looks a state, and so he should. I quiver, shudder and celebrate at the thought of how he'll progress over the next few hours. How many times will Mark Selby say \"obviously\"? Ronnie is tugging at his ears - what would Steve Peters say? Not been a good night for him. What a performance. This was incredible - Selby somehow hung in there yesterday, taking frames when apparently outclassed, and then when he needed to turn it up today, he did - 13-4 turned it up. \"I went numb\", says Ronnie. HE'S DONE IT! MARK SELBY IS THE WORLD SNOOKER CHAMPION! Perfection! A long pink, from the right middle pocket, into the bottom left corner! Now the black... In it goes! This is incredible! Down goes the brown, and now a blue with the rest into the yellow pocket... The yellow wobbles in the green jaws, but it's there! And he flicks the blue, giving him an angle on the green, from the bottom cushion and into the bottom left corner. And Selby rattles home the red! And the black! Clear the colours, and he's world champion! Selby takes on a nails red to the green pocket, jawses it,twice! - and somehow O'Sullivan misses it. Nerves are jangling like a newsagent's door. But Selby nails a red, and is in prime position to lay a tricky snooker. Or does he play the pot - it's a blue - and try and disturb the red. He opts for the snooker, but nervously pushes it, and there's a one cushion escape available. Ronnie plays it perfectly, just rolling up. Both reds are now out of commission - the score is 56-26 in O'Sullivan's favour, and you'd reckon he needs to pot just one more ball to skank the frame. But O'Sullivan comes to the table, plays a careless safety, and pockets the cue ball. \"You can cut the atmosphere with a knife\", apparently - and not the atmosphere cutter that you'd expect to be used in such circumstances. Down goes the black, leaving a difficult red - the other is still stuck to the green. And Selby misses the pot! Oh my. Selby has a black, and an angle to develop reds and green... Selby rolls a red along the top rail and home, but with two reds on the bottom cushion, two clustered by the pink, and the black on the green spot, the lead looks good. But I say! Selby plays a wonderful blue, jumping the cue ball and racing it up and down the table, cannoning the reds by the pink. But with the frame almost secure, he loses concentration and has to play a safety - it's a goodun, forcing Selby to clunk the red on the side cushion. It's gone well, but O'Sullivan manufactures a potting angle - which he raps against the jaws. Ok, here we are. A blue, and a cannon. Does he play it? He plays it! It's perfect! 49 ahead, 75 remaining. O'Sullivan cuts a blue into the green pocket, but a cannon again denies him position, but he brilliantly cuts another red, then a blue, and gently bends round for another red. This is wonderful play and testicles, and now caught up with position, a chance to claw back a frame. He's not - there's a red in the road - so he wallops home a green, dispatches the offending red, and somehow rolls out of position for the black. Too much check side (says not me, obviously). Selby leaves a red over the jaws, and though O'Sullivan's path to it is blocked, it's no problem for him to roll another into it. But is he on the black? O'Sullivan opens with a crunching red, but again, a bit of rushing and a bit of bad contact takes him out of position. Then, his safety leaves Selby a difficult chance - he plays it as a shot to nothing, and misses, undercutting a red to the bottom left corner. Frame 33 Here we go. Selby misses the chance for backIIback tons, lamping a red into the jaws and off the table, but he'll not be donating a faecal matter. Meanwhile, Selby is trotting around - two more balls, and Selby is three up with four to play. And unlike some, rather than be squashed by the might of his impending fulfilment, he is buzzing with buzz. \"I've written a new verse for the 80s classic Snooker Loopy. It helps if you know the tune. Or maybe if you don't.\" Don't know whether to be insulted at the suggestion of ignorance, or flattered by my Dorian Gray by-line photo. \"Now Mark Selby, it's plain to see Is a proper snooker star He's got the lot, nothing he can't pot And he's going to go far. Red and black, a big comeback As he seeks the world title He can win, without any flair Cos I'm a brilliant matchplayer.\" Ronnie is feeling this, knowing that one false move and he's almost done. He misses a tricky red, and a nervous Selby approaches the table, almost botching a red but recovering well. \" feel you have Selby all wrong\", chides Sean Burke. \"He looks half asleep, but you can see the smoulder of sudden violence in him, perfected by Al Pacino in The Godfather.\" Oh aye - I didn't say that I wasn't feart. I give you Ill Will. Frame 31 Selby misses with a thump and O'Sullivan punishes him, a bazzing pot into the bottom right followed by blue, red, green and a split pack. It's not gone as well as it might - he's on nothing. Tonight, there are actual people watching When James Corden Met Gary Barlow. This country. A break of 127, and Selby must be swimming, shaking and tripping. His life is two frames away. And there's the ton. Meanwhile, Greig Aitken is letting nothing lie. \"If Cliff Thorburn was in his stultifying pomp now, would he still be known as 'The Grinder', or as 'The Matchplayer'?\" And would his mustache be ironical? Email with Paul Tucker: \"Selby had the bloodless complexion and sunken eyes of somebody feeling the nausea from quite early on in that frame. The stomach must need some respite from the cold shock of missing relatively straightforward opportunities. Neither O'Sullivan or Selby have managed it this evening. I think I'm beginning to feel the nausea!\" It's Selby's default position - perhaps he suffers a rare kind of motion sickness, brought on by motion. Selby is feeling this, the run now 74 - incredibly, he's taken 15 frames off O'Sullivan, and not made a century. This should be it, but. \"It's a broad canvas, I know\", says James Crane, \"but the obsession with camera shots of family members/ gurning supporters is surely one of the very worst things about modern sports coverage, just show us the bloody game!\" Ronnie has a son, Littleronnie - did you know? Selby is in here - being translucent has its advantages, as it's impossible to tell when he looks nervous. His run is 32 so far. 30th frame O'Sullivan hits the white too thick, lands it in the yellow pocket, and Selby downs a testing red, bringing him back nicely for the green. Another shift in momentum - that yellow was remarkable, and Selby, to break,will be beginning to feel the nausea. Down goes the blue, the pink is cut home, and that's that. What a bizarre, wonderful, tingler of a frame that was. But Selby plays a poor safety, and Ronnie cuts home a red - then flicks the blue, slowing down the white and facilitating a green. Off the next red, he cannons the broon, and doesn't get a great angle, but pots the red anyway, then a further colour - I missed which. The yellow is along the right rail, and he rams it home to the bottom right - that is great. My computer crashed, so missed some small activity - it's 47-23 to Selby, and then O'Sullivan crashes home a red. The blue follows, but he misses a deeply taxing red along the top rail - one he had to play hard - but doesn't leave anything. This is another fascinating frame. On 15, Ronnie tries too hard to get on the next red potting a yellow, gets a minor kick, and given the reduced margin for error, jawses it. It might be a frame loser. Oh, what's this? Selby, on a buzz, plays a pot to the bottom left harder than necessary, and the extra distance to it leads to a miss. The lead is 29, but it's worth more given that the majority of reds are up in baulk. He pots immediately, and gets to work. Again, O'Sullivan can't match Selby's safety, leaving the cue ball behind but not tight to the black and a red on to the yellow pocket. After due consideration, Selby raps it home, sends a pink after it, and wades in. A safety exchange sends a number of reds up towards baulk, before Selby leaves a tight one to the middle. O'Sullivan misses, clumping the near knuckle, and Selby contemplates an even tighter one for a good minute and a half, deciding against it. \"Yes, let's remove all phrases used as shorthand to communicate shared ideas in sporting events,\" hrrrumphs Ewan Benson. \"Selby steps up and plays snooker. O'Sullivan plays snooker. Selby plays more snooker. Snooker played there by O'Sullivan\" I'd enjoy that, but we're discussing nonsense phrases, rather than the art describing events with words. \"High value colours are the new blue, pink and black\", says Greig Aitken. They go with everything. And why is the middle of the pocket known as its heart, given its lack of centrality as per the body? \"In snooker there is a form of strokeplay \u2013 that\u2019s you against the table. Matchplay is when you have to battle with your opponent and if it gets into that some are better (or worse!) than their strokeplay would suggest.\" So says Derek Duffy - is that when you're on your lonesome ownsome? And is that the distinction the commentators think they're making? I'm not sure... Frame 29 O'Sullivan's break again sends a red close to the black - playing into Selby's hands. Here's the thing: O'Sullivan can, will, win these frames. The question is what happens when things become messy - thus far this evening, Selby wins them. Snooker players' ticks: Joe Johnson What a shot! O'Sullivan pings home a red to the middle, and with the black available, this is a good chance. But he proceeds with blues to begin with, before progressing to the maximum, and it seems inconceivable that he won't clinch the frame at this visit. Up to 23, O'Sullivan plays a pink off its spot, his last chance to open the pack, and it's far from perfect. But, though the white is surrounded, he's on one, and bridging awkwardly, sends it home. Having covered the black, he cuts a blue to the centre, misses, almost pots it on its way down, and returns to his seat having left a very tricky one to the middle. Selby misses it by a distance. Frame 28 Selby breaks, and takes the cue ball up behind the yellow. A phone goes off, and there is no ripple of applause following refereeing ire - things must be tense. And O'Sullivan pastes in a red to the bottom right, and then a blue and another red. \"I'm surprised 'table management' hasn't bled across from golf's 'course management'\", volunteers Gary Naylor. Or \"playing golf\", and \"playing snooker\", as plebs describe it. Stephen Fry has ligged his way into the commentary box. Riveting. Anyway, that's the midsession. If Selby wins the next, it's hard to see how he loses. This is three holes in the ground territory. Selby is controlling this now, and O'Sullivan does not look like he knows how to stop the flow. If he gets in, fine, but otherwise, it's hard to see him reversing the pattern of the safety exchanges. Has anyone ever knocked O'Sullivan around after this fashion? \"He's got Ronnie O'Sullivan playing his way at the moment, and that's the art of a very good matchplayer.\" Still don't see how that's distinct from \"player\", mind. Here's Paul Bryant: \"Definitely disagree re: the concept of matchplay. It's distinct from playing with the absolute priority of winning the frame in question. Snooker (especially this tournament) involves such long periods of concentration that you cannot be at full intensity at all moments. Think of it being like good tennis where you don't necessary play with the particular point in mind - you put each point in its context and raise your game for the more important ones. Or in cricket when you do not always play to make runs - towards the end of the session your priority might change to keeping your wicket.\" That's good play, no? There is no other. \"I always thought that 'great matchplay' meant a player who could grind it out over long matches, good at defending a lead or clawing back a deficit\", says Greg Phillips. \"My entry in the cliche cannon: 'That's not what he would have wanted'.\" The phrase is definitely used during shorter contests, too - but matchplay still means winning matches, and \"play\" or \"win\". Ronnie misses another red, off the bottom cushion, aiming to cut into the opposite corner. He leaves nothing, but badly needs a Selby error, because he's losing the safety exchanges and looking frustrated. And, unsurprisingly, he makes an error. Selby has a red available - the cue ball's on the side cushion, below the object ball - and it's there! This should be a three frame lead... Selby is now up to 34, before expired position forces a safety. He leaves Ronnie right on the top cushion, and the escape is excellent - but no one, not even him, can maintain perfection under this kind of attack. \"Let's start with the 'shot to nothing'\", emails Greig Aitken. \"Just think of every word of that phrase. Slowly. They really mean to say: 'he's taking on a pot or baulk imponderable here'. I imagine Gary Neville would be able to get away with this if he was doing the snooker, such is his stock (pre-inevitable backlash next season) right now. Also, what is all this talk favoured by the modern day snooker commentariat of 'great matchplay', or 'it's not high quality snooker on display, but definitely fantastic matchplay.' Is there a 'stroke-play' form of snooker?\" Agreed absolutely on that last one - I think they mean \"he's keen to win\". Selby's cannon fails to bring anything into play, so, only 24 ahead, he's forced into a safety. That oughtn't to trouble him unduly, though - his play in that department has been exemplary all day. And, shonuf, Ronnie leaves him a red over the corner, the pressure of precision beginning to wear. \"...forcing Selby into a roll-up\". The spirit of The Embassy lives on...\" says Gary Naylor. And here's me trying to avoid parlaying that into a Ronnie gag. A touching ball gives Selby a chance, he takes it, and Selby is in amongst them. O'Sullivan is in some serious shtuck here. Selby sends a red up the table towards baulk, it returns and knocks in the aforementioned corner-coverer. Ronnie then finds himself tight behind the green, but escapes well, and they begin tapping at the cluster. A Selby safety shot flicks the green, the cue ball now close to its spot, and leaving Ronnie a long tempter to the bottom right. He misses it, but covers a red he carelessly sent over the opposite corner, which means a testing safety shot. Frame 27 Good break from O'Sullivan, ball close behind the green and forcing Selby into a roll-up. Finally, Selby sticks the pink away, and leads by two. Ronnie pots the blue, and they spend time chasing the pink - Selby trying to leave it over the pocket, Ronnie seeking a snooker. But he runs out of position, leaving Ronnie 33 behind and just the colours remaining. He rolls in a lovely yellow, but catches the green too thick trying to get in behind the pink - in baulk, close to the right cushion. Selby then misses the green, and Ronnie pots, bringing the blue into play. O'Sullivan misses a long pot, cannons the pink, and Selby is in, taking red, black, red, black. He should be clinching this at this visit, and the stench of dreams will be stinging his eyes and billowing his nostrils. A Selby safety leaves Ronnie behind brown and green, forcing Ronnie into a roll-up. He leaves a red straight to the right corner, taken and followed by the easy black, and just when this looks like a framewinner, a kick - still unexplained by science - means end of break. A variety of shots of varying quality has clustered the six remaining reds along the bottom cushion, five of them middle left, the pocked covered by the black. We could be here some time. What this match really needs is some analysis from Alan Shearer and James Redknapp. Selby pots a good red, but can't control the white, and sticks Ronnie (who has a son, Littleronnie) behind the brown. This is going to be another scrappy one. O'Sullivan, though, is never quite in position during this break - he plays some lovely shots, but on 25, his issues catch up with him, and he misses a black. With 15 on the board, Selby hammers in a black, aiming to break the pack, but is too heavy with his topspin - and relieved when a loose red bumps the cushion to become available into the middle. But the following red leaves a tricky brown, which is missed, and the cue ball cannons the pack. Ronnie is left with a straightish red to the green pocket which he can play without fear of leaving anything. He hits it perfectly, and this is now a chance. Frame 26 Selby leaves one over the bottom right, but a nasty centimetre or so from the cushion, and with the cue ball a long way up the table. Selby knucks it home beautifully, cueing dead straight. Off we go again. And, eventually, Ronnie leaves a red, sent into the bottom left, and this should be the frame. Selby snookers him behind yellow and brown, and he stays in his seat. Selby takes a while over this shot, so we see the ligging Stephen Fry, and friend of Ronnie, Damien Hirst. And the drummer from Iron Maiden - \"there are a lot of dignitaries here\", apparently. \"Where's the white ball goingggg?\" says William Boud, \"has he got an angle\", says Steve Barron. My favourite: \"the knowledgeable Crucible audience\" (who're being told what to think via the telly commentary to which they're listening). \"Seems Ronnie has remembered that he's called The Rocket and not The Nugget. That's no joke for The Jester\", reckons Gary Naylor. If I knew how to use Photoshop, I'd be sticking Steve Davis' face on one of these. There are two reds left - one tight on the top cushion, and the other being pursued. The word \"cushion\" is something or a misnomer - can't imagine a pregnant lady thanking you if you presented one as a sleeping aid. I f Mark Selby loses this, it'll be his potting that's to blame, and he misses frame ball - a testing, but barely difficult pink to the middle, from around the black spot. O'Sullivan is 42 behind with 43 remaining. Selby, though, is uncowed, and knocks in a brilliant red, played slowly and cut \"right in the heart\" of the bottom left. He then stutters a snooker behind the yellow, and pounces when the escape leaves him a chance. But what's this! A loose positional shot, and Selby is back at the table, missing a red to the bottom left, hit dead weight. He's lucky, but - there's nothing on, so he'll have to negotiate a cue ball tight against the top cushion, rather than another lost frame. 46 points behind, O'Sullivan comes to the table, an immediately downs a wonderful red, potted hard to the bottom left from high up in baulk. This is looking ominous. Furthermore, your favourite snooker cliches please. Selby just hasn't been able to build breaks in the usual manner, and screwing up and down the table, runs out of position. As such, a question: does the phrase \"run out of position\" refer to its expiration, or an undesired path taken by the ball? This is terrific from Selby, chasing position around the table before a red with the rest opens the pack and brings the pink into play. Excellent - but then, in dispatching it into the middle, he cannons the green, prompting a further superb red. And it goes! Selby did very well to ease that in, and he's on the brown, then back down the business end - a phrase guaranteed to donate the willies to anyone who's attended a birth. A brief safety exchange, ball back to baulk each time, before O'Sullivan plays a roll-up - possibly leaving a plant to the middle. But, after intimating a thin prod, Selby takes the ball back up into baulk, and all's back to normal. Selby leaves Ronnie behind the black, and two efforts off the side cushion - aimed at the top of the cluster of reds - hit the pink. The third effort is much better, and this is already sweating hint of re-rack. Frame 25 Good break from Ronnie, cue ball tight on the top cushion behind the green. Did you know: Ronnie O'Sullivan has a son, Littleronnie. O'Sullivan gets to 100 and misses, but he cued better than at any time this afternoon. The Rocket is flowing - well, he would be, if rockets flowed, which they do not. That's 73, frame clinched quicksmart, and that pink just a bad memory, a Steven Gerrard slip, if you will. \"The photo you chose make Ronnie look like an undead Groucho Marx\", reckons Elliot Wilson. Selby, on the other hand, makes a good case for the above table lighting to be ultraviolet. Frame 24 Selby breaks and O'Sullivan, spikes combed down, rattles in an opening red, quickly racing to 20 - before he's forced to open the pack. And it's worked beautifully, black and pink both available. He chooses the former, and this is now a chance. Alternative uses for Rob Walker No1: pope. \"He is the Messiah, blink and you'll miss him, impervious to death from Nazareth, it's Jesus!\" Great choice of music. Oh, 1990. The BBC are really waving their appendages around here. Hushed voices, moody tones, waving cues. And it's not even annoying. PLAY THE MUSIC \u03b4\u03c1\u1fb6\u03bc\u03b1. Apparently, some people refer to it as drama, but we're purists here, and so we should be, for we are about to experience the highest iteration of the most intense kind. Few sporting examinations compare to the lonely and constant pressure of professional snooker, let alone World Championship final at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield snooker. The capacity for error, to succumb to nerves, to look silly, to crumble and burn, is greater than in any other context; consider the minute margins, stupefying silence and indefinite duration. Balls and baize, yes, but also human beings, human souls, and an easy way to determine which are worth your time. This is going to be special. Right, I'll be back at seven. If you're not panting with excitement, you have no part of this world and no place in the world to come. \"Compelling, yes, but surely the lowest quality session there's been in a World final for decades? Barry Hearn's got a job to do if this is the best there's ever been versus the world number one.\" Agreed, some miserable stuff there - but disagree that the standard must necessarily be high. Generally it is, and in the final, you want drama most of all. This is some. My days. And it's there! O'Sullivan spanks home the brown, then slides the blue into the green pocket - and what's this! With only pink required, he wallops it to the middle to get position on the black, it do-si-does the top of the jaw, and Selby clear up! What on earth was that! I don't know! Do you? No! Oh! Neither do I! But the brown is unpottable, so Selby attempts a snooker, white behind black. It's not quite there, and Ronnie responds by blocking brown with pink, forcing an error from Selby - punished with neither snooker nor pot. Oh this is nice from Selby, feathering green into brown close to the bottom cushion, and taking the cue ball all the way to the top. And O'Sullivan, keen for the brown to remain out of commission, tickles the green and leaves a cut into the middle, which Selby takes. Selby rattles the yellow into the bottom left, and there's a long green awaiting him. He plays it hard, but wavers in the delivery, and misses - Ronnie can now cut it into the left middle, past the pink. But in trying to avoid the kiss on the black that would make the brown tricky, he too misses. Another poor safety from Selby - he's left the yellow on, then covered it with the green. O'Sullivan then clips the blue with the cue ball, leaves the yellow to the same pocket, Selby misses - and again spawns a snooker. And again, Ronnie deals with it. What a frame this is. What a championship this has been. What are we all going to do tomorrow. There exist human beings who don't like snooker. Just contemplate that for a moment. This will be the final frame of the afternoon. O'Sullivan hits it this time, but leaves a tempter to the green pocket - which Selby eschews. He plays another poor safety, and again is lucky, covering yellow with blue - twice, noch! Selby is lucky a second time, fluking a snooker - the cue ball's on the bottom cushion, the yellow just above its spot, and the pink in between. Ronnie misses, and is put back. We're now enjoying the longest frame of the match. \"Come on, the alternative universe name for snooker would obviously be 'Potty-Stick'\", emails Chris Buchanan. Ronnie might have taken on the yellow, chose not to, and found himself in a disadvantageous position when Selby hit it next go. The subsequent safety left the pot on - but there's plenty difference between cue and object ball, and it's not that close. Ronnie clear up the reds, but position expires, and so he drops in behind the black. Selby can't hit the yellow, so foul and amiss is called, and then again - this time he gets much closer. Ronnie puts him back again, and he misses again... Here's Rob Marriott with a lesson for us all me. \"As I understand it, the word snooker predates the sport - it was 19th century officer slang for an incompetent novice. Snooker billiards was a kind of billiards in which you tried to make your opponent look like a snooker, by forcing him into a mistake. So, if what I've been told was true, forcing your opponent into a snooker has always been what the game's about, and what differentiates it from other types of billiards.\" You calling me a snooker? Selby mixes the two. playing a hit-and-hope pot, missing, leaving, and this frame may now be over. If Ronnie takes blacks, he won't need the pink that's up near the yellow spot - but there's also a stray red from earlier, up near the green pocket. But on his way down the table, Ronnie pots a blue too thin, failing to land on a red. He's vex-up, but responds with a good safety. Selby has a problem, here - there's no route back to baulk, and nothing into which he can roll. It's looking like an iffy pot, or a two cushion escape. Selby misses! The ball rattles the jaw, ends up over the green pocket, ends up in the green pocket, and Ronnie is in. With the pink blocking the safest red, on the left cushion, Selby plays off that cushion and drops the white into the bottom left. But there's nothing on, so he plays a poor safety instead, leaving a red over the aforementioned corner. A safety exchange - dictated by O'Sullivan. This is now a huge frame for Selby - lose it, when it should've been his, and momentum passes. Win it, and the previous one was just a blip. \"Re: Dave's moaning. The clue to the nature of the game is in its very name\" reckons Ewan Benson. I wonder - isn't it more likely that \"a snooker\" took it's name from the game, and were the game called floccinaucinihilipilification, the circumstance would be too? And Selby then bashes a brown into the yellow pocket, too hard to get himself on a red - end of break. But Ronnie misjudges his safety, and the white ends up where the yellow didn't. Sport can be so compelling when played sketchily. The players have potted 337 balls each, \"an amazing stat\". Selby then dispatches another, and we are all bereft. A loose O'Sullivan safety shot gives Selby a shot at a red and he sinks it - a yellow and second red brings him down the business end. But the constellation of reds around the black makes this a tricky chance, forcing him to screw back up for a second yellow. O'Sullivan's safety has picked up, and he forces an error from Selby - this gives him the chance of a pot, a cut into the bottom right. Wary of leaving a chance, he plays it harder than necessary, wobbling the ball in the jaws, but getting the white safe. Really, Mark Selby should be playing in this. Oh! Selby plays a cannon off the blue, aiming to scatter the reds, and instead catches the black - which slides into the bottom right pocket. There's nothing on, but Ronnie plays a handy snooker, and after Selby rolls into the pack, a left-hander take takes the cue ball back into baulk, and wrests control of the exchange. O'Sullivan's safety has not be up to much today, and he leaves a red that Selby snaffles, followed by a green and red, almost screwing back the cue ball into the left middle. But it stays out, and blue-red-black follow - though with the black on the pink spot, there's plenty to do before this is a frame winning chance. Ronnie taps the table in appreciation, after Selby plays a handy safety. \"Nice to see, even in the heat of battle\", intones John Virgo as though he's said it seventy-three billion times before. Frame 23. O'Sullivan breaks, and takes the cue ball to behind the green - leaving a tempter just below the blue, to the bottom left pocket. Selby plays it as a shot to nothing, the red catches the near knuckle, and there follows a safety exchange. Ronnie clears up to pink, puts the cue on the table, and jogs off for a lag. I'm not surprised. That's his first frame of the day, and stops a run of six in a row for Selby. 11-11. Selby takes a risky green, misses, and leaves it for Ronnie - a difficult one, to the top left, with both cue and object ball near enough the bottom right. And it's there! This is incredible! Shame on anyone enjoying the sunshine. But Selby can't quite get the angle he's after, so plays a poor safety - saving both the ignominy of attempting any immediate pots. Ronnie slams home the black, but it's straight, so no angle for the yellow - which he subsequently undercuts, and a kiss off the green leaves it on. Selby tries to force matters, as the green is level with the pink spot, but misses. And then Ronnie misses too, cutting a long pot too thick to the green pocked. What a crucial frame this has become. And Selby rattles the back of the jaw! And Ronnie misses a sitter, down the right cushion! Looking like 12-10 Selby now! And Selby only just pots it! And misses the green! And so does Ronnie! More exchanges - this is looking like the decisive ball of the frame. With the red now up in baulk, Selby tries a half-arsed cut as a shot to nothing, leaving it touching the yellow, but cuttable. And it's there! Selby plays the safety, taking the cue ball to behind the brown, and leaving the red close to the right cushion. Ronnie's response isn't great, but serves a purpose. And it's jawed, off the near knuckle! Not quite over the pocket, but it might just cut... O'Sullivan eases a black into the bottom right corner, and with three reds remaining, needs, most likely to green. And here comes the key shot - a black, stunned to get behind the red on the left rail. Selby misses a red to the corner and O'Sullivan - no doubt I'll slip into Ronnie soon enough - fairly leaps out of his seat. This is a chance, because there are are no seriously difficult balls preventing a clear-up. \"Dave Stainton is absolutely right.\" says Hugh Brechin. \"Mark Selby should open the reds up, take Ronnie on and lose in watchable fashion like a gentleman. (Also, I've now got the bits about jesters from Don McLean's American Pie stuck in my head, so cheers for that, Mark.)\" When the jester sang for the king and queen, in a coat he borrowed from James Dean, and a voice that came from you and meeeeee. In pre-internet days, when you had to wait for your walkman batteries to run down to deduce the lyrics to a song, that was one the captures chunks of my time, along with all of Nevermind. Any more for any more? Snooker books: Infinite Jester from Leicester, by David Foster Wallace. Selby called Willie Thorne last night, delighted to have won the final two frames last night, and he's playing like a man reprieved. Pink and black are \"out of commission\", but, like in Quadrophenia, blues are are doing the trick. Frame 22 Selby breaks, and takes the cue ball back to baulk, not quite tight on the cushion, but nicely behind the yellow. With nothing on, O'Sullivan plays off two cushions into the pack - but he's left one to the corner! Selby forces it home, and then cuts a pink to get in amongst it. And here they come! Boys/baize interface reached. Slouch in and eyes down - this is going to be a thriller. \"The first few shots of every frame are imperative for Ronnie.\" So says Stephen Hendry, but with no translation forthcoming. Ronnie O'Sullivan is spending the entirety of the interval talking to Brendan Rodgers' disciple, Steve Peters. Ah, no - he's now in the practice room, knocking in the balls from which he's been separated for most of the last mini-session. It's bank holiday. It's sunny. The streets and parks are full of humans, humans enjoying themselves. Revolting. But help is at hand. There is no excuse - you have no option - but to draw your curtains, lower the lights, don tracksuit or pants, eat biscuits, and gorge on glorious, delightful, magical, wonderful, compelling, absorbing world championship snooker final. Anyway, I'm handing over to Daniel Harris, who looks like he could be here for the long run for the rest of this match. Thanks for your emails, including this one from Dave Stainton. \"I take it Mark Selby's nickname is meant to be ironic?\" he emails. \"His way of grinding Ronnie down has me drifting in and out of consciousness. If I was King and he was my jester he'd be off to the gibbet.\" Thoughts? Cheers, James. And off to the mid-session interval we go. All four frames this afternoon to Selby, and six in a row to Selby. O'Sullivan looks cold at the table, and in deep trouble. There are 35 points left on the table, with Selby 34 ahead, but he's astutely tucked the black tight(ish)ly to the bottom cushion. But it's not the frame ball, as a tricky red to the right middle which would have left O'Sullivan needing snookers is missed. It's 62-28 to Selby. O'Sullivan takes a gamble with an aggressive red to the top left, but it's wild and lucky to run to safety. Selby drops a delicious snooker by way of response but watches his opponent get straight up and escape brilliantly. It still looks like six in a row for Selby, though. O'Sullivan's escape is majestic and he's soon into a safety exchange that could decide this frame. But after opening up the last reds, he's clumsy again and leaves a red to the top left which Selby snaffles up. That could be frame ball. More trouble for O'Sullivan here, the right face on him in his seat as another loose shot puts Selby back on the table \u2013 keeping the Rocket off the baize has been key in this session so far. Before long, Selby has compiled 28 to lead 51-24, with three reds left. He over-runs a pink and opts for the snooker. Selby is quickly back in with another chance, O'Sullivan clumsy with his safety. But after leaving himself an awkward shot with the rest, Selby misses again. The Crucible crowd exhale, a number of coughs stifled until miss on this occasion. 24-15 in the frame to O'Sullivan. \"I used to wonder why snooker didn't go for a frames and sets format (as they do in the darts for example), but I don't any more,\" writes Gary Naylor. \"So much about Crucible snooker is about momentum, about not giving in to the voice that tells you that it's OK to ease up on the concentration when you're five frames ahead, about switching on and off at exactly the right moments. The long crawl to 18 at the end of 17 days' play is one of sport's cruellest delights.\" A cruel delight and then some. Selby is expectedly curtailed, trailing 20-9 in the frame when he misses a relatively simple red to the bottom right. He recoils immediately, eyeing up a member of the Crucible crowd who coughed just before the shot. You've got to love sport when ailments of the audience can potentially cause bother. Early bother for Selby. Two fouls in succession end with him going in-off with the white. O'Sullivan has half a chance and he gets to work with a couple of marvellous pots. But the table's not in his favour, and after struggling to force an angle off the blue, he's forced into safety. It's not good enough, mind, much as it hasn't through this third session, and Selby is back on a break. Though it'll be hard to build from here. Frame 21: Off we go again and with the pack of reds tightly grouped and the red almost buried in among it, there's a whiff of an imminent re-rack. A safety to the baulk ends the threat and we're into a longer-range safety exchange. Five frames in a row for Selby! A break of 74 is curtailed by a missed yellow to the left middle, but this is a splendid recovery. Brilliance from Selby, who looks fresher than he understandably did yesterday off the back of that semi with Robertson. He's disrupted O'Sullivan's rhythm, and looks in control. Taking the break to 55, he leaves O'Sullivan needing snookers. Selby is again on the front foot, his safety game superior at present and O'Sullivan growing increasingly frustrated. After opening the pack of reds, he's soon on to a 22-7 frame advantage. It's no easy clearance, but this is looking like a strong frame-winning opportunity. Just then, the BBC flash up a brilliant stat: both players are on 6,339 points for the match. Frame 20: Selby has the first sniff here and O'Sullivan is still yet to get any kind of clear run at the table. After reaching nine the break drys up, before tempting O'Sullivan into an aggressive safety \u2013 indicative of his frustration at the game not being open enough at present. O'Sullivan escapes, but things look like they're soon about to open up. \"This has the feeling of a classic already to me,\" declares Detective Steven Pye, who you may know from such pieces as how Steve Davis won his second World Snooker Championship in 1983. \"I'll probably be caught in the 'just one more frame before bed' situation tonight, as hopefully the final goes all the way, and we get an 18-17 thriller.\" Here's hoping, though that's easier for me to say given I won't still be here. Selby's safety game soon does for frame No19 and he pulls within one frame as O'Sullivan concedes from his seat. This is on. O'Sullivan's rescue mission immediately comes a cropper, though, missing the black after his first red. Excellent break-building from Selby and he's soon closing in on a frame-winning advantage. As his break reaches 52, O'Sullivan looks set to need snookers. This looks like a fourth frame on the spin for Selby. But \u2026 but \u2026 he misses. O'Sullivan can tie with three reds and blacks, and a subsequent clearance. It causes O'Sullivan some bother, all right. He fails to escape on two occasions, but from the latter he leaves Selby an opening \u2013 and he jumps on it. In among the balls, Selby has a real chance to pull back within a single frame. Selby is 34-22 up and counting. Fourteen minutes in to this frame and it's still filed under 'tactical'. But then Selby spots a plant to nothing and tidily pulls it off. There's not much on, mind, and he drops a snooker on O'Sullivan with the white in behind the green, which is sat high up on the right cushion. After a safety exchange, O'Sullivan eventually leaves Selby an opening. He fails to capitalise on to colour, before soon being left another chance; a long red with the rest into the top-left corner gets him away, before settling for safety after reaching 11. It's 22-12 to O'Sullivan. Effort No5 ends up kissing the pink, giving O'Sullivan 22 in total fouls, before No6 finally ends the pain. And then we're back into a safety game, Selby still being asked the questions, mind. Frame 19: Momentum with Selby, then. But for how long? O'Sullivan breaks left-handed and brings the white on a string around the table and right in tight behind the green. Selby's escape goes off three cushions but is foiled by the left-middle jaws \u2026 and then again with his next attempt. The third effort is equally unsuccessful, before No4 ends in the left middle pocket. O'Sullivan drills in a spectacular green, but then leaves the brown open after his next long-range effort. Selby then clears, ending with a ridiculous double, playing the white off the left cushion and on to the black, knocking it politely into the bottom right pocket. Three in a row for Selby. Oh. Any emails? But after a careful check of the scoreboard and even more careful break management, Selby builds a break of 55 and leads by 27 with 25 on the table. A safety off the green means O'Sullivan will be back, needing just a snooker, but he's obviously the heavy favourite to reduce his arrears to 10-8. Selby's break reaches 36 as he clears both top corner pockets, but then knocks the green to safety off a red; he may still need that if the break goes that far. With only three reds, pink and black below the blue, this frame is shaping up to be a mess. But then O'Sullivan plays down table and clumsily watches his top spin take the cueball in off and into the bottom left corner pocket. Selby quickly sets about tidying up the table. \u2026 but O'Sullivan's stun shot fails to break the pack cleanly. He's left with a double to nothing, which misses. No real danger, although Selby is almost right back in it with his next shot, sending the yellow precariously over the top left pocket. If that's not dangerous enough, his next defensive shot sends the green into the top-right jaws. Soon there are five reds hanging around baulk and this is set for a scrappy opening epic. Frame 18 of 35 \u2013 O'Sullivan leads 10-7: Selby breaks but immediately it's O'Sullivan in the ascendancy. A red gets him started before a wild yellow to the middle, cueball scrambling like a memory from your childhood. The reds are tightly packed as O'Sullivan reaches 25, with an angle off the black \u2026 \"The Crucible awaits and, so to, does MC Rob Walker.\" Ten words to strike fear into the hearts of an sane individual. The BBC's coverage is up and running and, as the grating MC persona trills, the boys are being called to the baize. Frame 18 will begin shortly. But. But \u2026 as O'Sullivan himself notes, \"Mark's the toughest competitor on tour\", and anyone who was fortunate enough to catch Selby's staggeringly good semi-final with Neil Robertson will probably be able to vouch for that. It's seven years since his early-morning defeat to John Higgins, a final in which he rallied and rallied, and then rallied some more, since when he's won the UK Championship and three Masters titles, as well as the honour of a Small Talk interview (I know). And it's not as if he hasn't beaten O'Sullivan before, winning seven of their previous 21 meetings according to these head-to-head stats\u2026 Of the five world finals which have involved O'Sullivan, he has won the lot, never having been taken deeper than 32 frames. His record reads: 18-14 v John Higgins (2001), 18-8 v Graeme Dott (2004), 18-8 v Ali Carter (2008), 18-11 v Carter (2012) and 18-12 v Barry Hawkins (2013); a total of 100-60 if you include the current final. The bookies' price of 5-1 on Selby in this two-horse race tells its own tale. Good afternoon, and welcome to our frame-by-frame coverage of the 2014 World Snooker Championship final, with Ronnie O'Sullivan leading Mark Selby 10-7 after an intriguing first two sessions at the Crucible yesterday. The, ahem, Jester from Leicester (it's no Sheriff of Pottingham) did pretty well to get out of last night's second session with a three-frame deficit and keep himself well in this match, but O'Sullivan is looking pretty close to his brilliant best. You get the sense it will take something spectacular from Selby if he's to avoid a second final defeat in his second world final, but of the few players in world snooker capable of pulling it off, he could just be one to do it. Anyway, it's the first to 18 and the third session begins at around 2pm BST. In the meantime, here's some Drag Racer from the Doug Wood Group to get you in the mood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
