I hope it is not too much of a culture shock for Dominic Grieve (Multicultural ideal 'terrible' for UK - Tories, September 27) who chooses this moment to warn of the \"terrible legacy\" of multiculturalism. He needn't worry. Birmingham is a diverse city, most people think of it as one of our strengths, and we are tolerant enough to survive a temporary influx of Tories. But if it is odd to warn of the perils of multiculturalism while visiting one of the most multicultural cities in Europe, the timing is all too predictable. The financial system is in chaos, food and fuel prices are escalating, a looming recession leaves many people fearful of their future, and David Cameron's opinion poll lead is halved. What better time than now to raise fears about British identity? We are threatened by economic insecurity, to which neither Cameron nor Brown offer compelling solutions. We are not threatened by difference, diversity or multiculturalism. Dominic Grieve gives the wrong answer to a question we are not asking. Cllr Salma Yaqoob Birmingham The shadow home secretary's remarks betray a perverse misunderstanding that should warn every voter about the dangers of Tory policy in this area. There is no \"new multicultural society\"; from its earliest history, Britain has been culturally diverse. Attempts to recognise and celebrate this through, for example, multicultural education have not been intended to \"create a melting pot\" or to deny the cultural identity of anyone who considers themselves British. Multicultural education has always worked towards promoting understanding of and respect for the cultural identity of all people, including Britain's sort-of long-term inhabitants (a great many of them of minority-group origin). Don Lee Former multicultural education adviser, Bedfordshire county council Since Christian denominations are multicultural, rather than integrated, why should the Tories want a different standard for other faiths and cultures? In the 1960s when Christian Unity started, the aim was to have the different denominations integrated into one church. It soon became apparent that worshippers valued their own specific beliefs and methods of worship. While they welcomed the dialogue and worshipping together, they would not relinquish their own faith and practices - or cultures. So multiculturalism, not integration became the way to unity. This respect for each other's way of doing things meant that the other person's faith was valued because it gave different insights; it recognised that we are all struggling to discover the truth in different ways,. Since the 1960s churches are much more at peace with each other. They cooperate on such things as the Christian Aid collection. In most towns they worship together periodically. The clergy meet regularly and have pulpit swaps. Significantly, the different denominations retain their own individuality. The experience of multiculturalism in our churches is that you do have to work at it. You do have to meet and listen to each other. Respect for and value of each other's cultures is vital. Integration failed, multiculturalism works. Rob Wheway Liberal Institute The views of the shadow home secretary echo the views of his boss, who said that multiculturalism had created a \"cultural apartheid\". Racism is a combination of prejudice and power. It is not the inanimate institutions which are racist; it is their staffs that perpetuate racism. Government and the legal system should reflect the country's cultural diversity, rather than having a few token minority ethnic group representatives. The Tories' record in this area is abysmal. Most of all, there should be dialogue between the broad range of cultural communities, including more than just the visible ethnic groups. Cultural diversity is a fact; multiculturalism is what we do with the fact.
