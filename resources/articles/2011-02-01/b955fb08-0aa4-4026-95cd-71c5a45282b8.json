Still, the best bits of Different Gear Still Speeding sound least like the band Beady Eye used to be: the breezily melodic Millionaire is fantastic, the episodic Wigwam more ambitious than you might expect. Elsewhere, there's some very slender songwriting, and Gallagher Jr apes the plonking lyrics that made his brother look more dim than he actually is. At its worst, as on single The Roller \u2013 gurning Lennon vocals, lumbering glitterbeat, lyrical exhortations to \"hold on\" \u2013 you simply gawp, thinking: never mind anyone else, aren't you bored of this kind of thing now?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
