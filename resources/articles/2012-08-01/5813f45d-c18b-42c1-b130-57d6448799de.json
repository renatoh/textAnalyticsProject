Agger was sent off for a professional foul on Shane Long during the 3-0 defeat at The Hawthorns and the manager, Brendan Rodgers, said that Liverpool would look to overturn a \"very harsh\" decision by the referee Phil Dowd. Following further review of the incident, Liverpool have decided against an appeal to the Football Association. Agger could have received an additional one-match ban for a frivolous appeal, ruling him out of the City and Arsenal home games, but will now miss only Rodgers' first league game at Anfield as Liverpool manager. The Bolton manager, Owen Coyle, has confirmed he wants to sign the Liverpool midfielder Jay Spearing on a season-long loan. Arsenal continue to negotiate with Real Madrid over the loan signing of Nuri Sahin. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, wants the option to make the transfer permanent but Madrid are reluctant to sell in case Sahin was to find exceptional form. Alex Song has completed his \u00a315m transfer to Barcelona, having undergone a medical. Martin O'Neill is striving to bring Adam Johnson to Sunderland after the chairman, Ellis Short, agreed to finance a deal for the Manchester City winger. A \u00a310m price has been set, which is understood to have been met by five clubs. Johnson, who has been the subject of interest from Everton and Newcastle United, is believed to have turned two of five teams down but has not rejected Sunderland. Josh McEachran is poised to make his debut for Middlesbrough in Championship game against Burnley at the Riverside after arriving from Chelsea on a season-long loan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
