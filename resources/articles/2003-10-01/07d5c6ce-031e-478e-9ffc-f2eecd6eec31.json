The last thing Keane would have been expecting was to see a fellow Irishman charging down Wigan's right wing. But Brian Carney, a 27-year-old from County Wicklow who stumbled on rugby league as a law student in Dublin six years ago, is the man of the moment going into tomorrow's Super League grand final on Keane's home patch, Old Trafford. He scored two of the tries of the season in Wigan's breathless 23-22 win at Leeds last Friday, has been selected for the Tetley's Dream Team - the rugby shirt he received is now hanging, incongruously, in the bar his father runs in Hungary - and is in line to become the first Irishman to play for Great Britain, in next month's Ashes series. \"There's no other winger who could have scored that second try,\" said Wigan's assistant coach Denis Betts after Carney's 90-metre individual effort at Headingley. \"It puts him up there with the best of them.\" \"Brian is just a freak,\" added Kris Radlinski, who combined brilliantly with him for the first. \"And there's nobody who could deserve it more. He might play the joker, but I've never known anyone who works so hard on his game.\" The hard work started in Gateshead, of all places. His progress was slow at first, particularly as there was no reserve team, but a powerful try against Wigan at Tynecastle - in Super League's early years - was the first indication that the gamble might pay off. Not in Gateshead, though, for all the Thunder's on-field success in their debut season, as the finances did not stack up. So Carney and his team-mates found themselves relocating to Hull as part of a controversial merger that revived the game on Humberside but almost killed it off in the north-east. Now Carney found himself in rugby league land for the first time, and the pace of his education accelerated. The most significant event of his season at Hull came early on, in a Challenge Cup quarter-final win against Wigan, when he came straight out of the sin-bin and sprinted across the field to make a try-saving tackle on Steve Renouf. That, plus the memory of the try at Tynecastle, persuaded Wigan to take a chance on Carney the following year. \"I loved it at Hull, but I was never going to turn down Wigan,\" he said. \"They are the biggest rugby league club in the world.\" And, he admits, the only one he had heard of a few years before. The Wigan supporters instantly took to his all-action style but Stuart Raper, the Australian who took over as coach midway through Carney's first season, worried about a lack of experience that would occasionally show through, and he was substituted after only 12 minutes of their 37-6 grand final thrashing by Bradford at the end of the year. But by last spring Carney was a first-team regular, sharing in the Challenge Cup triumph against St Helens. This season, under first Raper, and more recently Betts and Mike Gregory, there have been more spectacular tries, and hardly any errors. \"If you'd said to me when I was a student in Dublin that I'd be playing in grand finals with Wigan, I wouldn't have fancied your chances,\" said Carney, whose only previous final experience came in Gaelic football with Valleymount. \"I've been very lucky. The whole thing has been a bit of a dream.\" A few of his Valleymount mates have flown over for the weekend and there will be plenty more watching at home. Unless he has a nightmare, Carney will then be preparing with the full Great Britain squad - renamed Great Britain and Ireland four years ago, mainly for funding reasons but now necessarily for accuracy - for his Test debut, against Australia at Wigan, the following week. It has been a remarkable journey, and it is not over yet. \u00b7 Michael Withers, the Australian utility back, has signed a new three-year contract with Bradford. The 27-year-old, who has scored 90 tries in 111 games, is expected to line up at centre in the grand final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
