We\u2019ve always said the Booker prize is as much for readers as it is for writers, and readers are best served by a variety of ways in which to discover books they might love. But I feel compelled to correct a misconception. There are clearly those who feel, as your editorial suggests, that the prize has lost some of its original character by opening up to the world. But that is very different from a loss of prestige. Without wishing to dwell on the obvious comparison to Brexit, the British empire also lost some of its distinctiveness once upon a time, and indeed the world lost its formerly flat character when it was discovered to be round. A variety of opinions about inclusion is welcome \u2013 there are knock-on effects to be discussed, and they are being discussed \u2013 but it\u2019s shortsighted to fuse progress with \u201cslipping down the cultural pecking order\u201d. We don\u2019t believe in a prize that excludes authors on the basis of their passports any more than we would exclude them based on the colour of their skin. After Tayari Jones won the Women\u2019s prize last week, she emphasised how pleased she was to be awarded a prize \u201con the international stage\u201d, and noted that \u201cso often, American literature is critiqued for being too insular\u201d. Well, American fiction isn\u2019t necessarily insular but American prizes certainly are. We don\u2019t have to stoop to that. Without borders, literature means something more. Gaby Wood Literary director, Booker Prize Foundation \u2022 Your editorial on the plethora of book prizes starting to eclipse the Booker was useful, particularly in its praise for the Women\u2019s prize for fiction. Might I mention two other prizes? The first is the Bread and Roses Award for Radical Publishing, whose winner will be announced on Tuesday night, and its more recent offspring The Little Rebels Children\u2019s Award which concludes in July. Neither of these prizes offer life-changing sums for the winners, but both share the view that books can change the world for the better as do the authors whose books grace our shortlists and longlists. Both awards were set up by the Alliance of Radical Booksellers to encourage the publication of good radical books for adults and children.
