Gerry Murphy, the chief executive, also explained that B&amp;Q is moving up-market, stocking big-ticket items - including a handmade radiator that will retail at \u00a35,000 - while the company is pursuing expansion with plans for a chain of stores in Russia. Kingfisher operates 579 stores in 10 countries, with more than 40% of sales being generated abroad. Announcing strong sales and better than expected profits, Mr Murphy said August trading had been comparatively good, and there was little to fear from current UK economic conditions. \"Consumption is holding up well. Nothing suggests a tailing off. Unemployment is low, disposable incomes are high on a historic basis and interest rates are low. Generally the environment is benign.\" He said a slowdown in the housing market would not be \"a huge issue\", adding: \"Right now we are not concerned with the housing market.\" Group sales climbed nearly 10% to \u00a34bn and profits in the six months to the end of July were up 18.4% to \u00a3346m - or 20.7% in constant currencies. In Britain, comparative sales at B&amp;Q were ahead 2.5%. The chain's seasonal ranges, which the company conceded were tired, performed poorly, but that dip was offset by strong growth in kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms. Mr Murphy said B&amp;Q was constantly updating and expanding its stores and its \"special order\" catalogues - for gardens, bathrooms, kitchens, air conditioning and so on - had allowed an additional 20,000 lines to be offered. B&amp;Q is determined to attract more high-spending customers and to that end is signing up more kitchen fitters because such buyers expect to have kitchens installed by the retailer. Kingfisher shares are often pushed up by takeover speculation but analysts were impressed with the numbers and the shares rose 9.5p to 299.5p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
