This came as a shock as I was quietly optimistic I'd scramble into the top five somewhere. As the programme buyer for Channel 4, I find myself this week in the sun-kissed and perennially hip Los Angeles for the screenings. This is where the networks present their fall schedules, and buyers eagerly flock from all over the globe to see the shows (and, hopefully, acquire the right programmes for their channels). So, basically, you watch telly all day in beautiful California. And get paid for doing so. But what's this? It's raining in LA. Consequently, everything stops. The city falls into a mood of collective lethargy. Here, everyone panics wildly if the roads are even vaguely damp so our minivan is predictably delayed. When it eventually arrives, I'm hesitant. I think the last time it saw action was a fleeting cameo in Ironside. Our driver Raul appears and we head off to see Warner Bros, the largest supplier of shows to the networks. You can see why - quality shows that have wide international appeal, and with strong slots on the network schedule that ensure their longevity. Well, that's what they tell us. Smith, starring Ray Liotta, Studio 60, written by Aaron Sorkin, and The Nine will all make an impact this year. (A guy called Dave drives us home. Raul's fate is uncertain.) Dinner is at Mr Chow's, the famous Chinese restaurant in Beverly Hills. On the wine list is a collection of fine vintages called the Magnificent Seven. I ponder the description. The seven is self evident - there are seven of them. I suspect the preceding \"magnificent\" relates to the price: $1,500 a bottle. We have a prudent Pinot Grigio, and then call it a night. Tuesday, May 23 Today we go to Fox. When we reach security they tell us to park under Julie Andrews. An intimate request, and one I hope her agent has legally agreed. We're relieved to spot the 50ft painting of the Sound of Music star splashed over the car park wall. We recently secured a major film deal with Fox so everyone is happy to see us. The screening is strong; there's Vanished, a one-hour about a kidnapping that will play out over 22 weeks, Ted Danson's new half-hour, Help Me Help You, and Standoff, about hostage negotiators who are having an affair which is against government policy. In the evening we go to a dinner hosted by NBC Universal at an executive's home in Hancock Park. Paul Haggis is there to help promote his new show, The Black Donnellys, and playing the piano with tuneful ease is Jeff Goldblum. He is starring in Fox's new show Raines, and when he later works the room I remind him that we had met the previous week in New York. To corroborate this I show him the picture on my phone and he remembers me. I mention that my wife calls his name when we make love. At this point, may I remind you that I'm called Jeff. I may also need to apologise for the joke. The kind people at NBC bring out a cake as it's my birthday on Sunday. I wait patiently for the curvy starlet to leap out from beneath the icing. It doesn't happen. I retreat to the hotel for a crafty nightcap or two ... then bed. Wednesday, May 24 Today we are off to Burbank and the Mouse House, aka Disney. The studio lot has some wonderful buildings from the 1930s and giant statues of the seven dwarfs from the 1990s. Disney is the home of Lost and Desperate Housewives. This year they have comedies to show us: In Case of Emergency and Let's Rob and the mid-season drama Daybreak. In the afternoon we move to NBC Universal where I continue my burgeoning friendship with Mr Goldblum and view Raines, his new police drama, and Paul Haggis's The Black Donnellys. Tonight we are invited to the home of the WB chief. From the Babylonian garden there are wonderful, panoramic views of the city - and other people's Babylonian gardens. We sit and talk to John Wells, creator of Smith and the producer/writer of ER and The West Wing. He is so enthusiastic that you can see his vision taking shape in front of you. It's then back to the hotel for a nightcap. At some point I go to bed. Thursday, May 25 Last day. We pile into the van with Raul (who, thankfully, has returned in full health) to see Paramount with their wonderful Melrose gates. We see post-apocalyptic drama Jericho and medical drama 3lbs with Stanley Tucci (3lbs is apparently what the human brain weighs. I fear mine is a malnourished, bantam-weight 3ozs). Then it happens - after days of growing anticipation, the biggest treat of the week. An In-N-Out double cheese burger. They're not merely fast food - they're LA legend. After eating (I think I managed a gluttonous three) we decide to move on to our last studio, Sony in Culver City. This is the oldest studio and was originally the home of MGM. Sony have some interesting shows too. Kidnapped, a drama which will unfold over the season, and Darren Star's Runaway. So that's it - the hard bit is over. Now for the easy task ... deciding what shows we should pick up, beating our competitors to it and negotiating with the studios. Wish me luck. \u00b7 Jeff Ford is director of acquisitions, Channel 4"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
