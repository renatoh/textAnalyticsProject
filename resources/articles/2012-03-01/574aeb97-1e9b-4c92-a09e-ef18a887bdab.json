This is the wrong approach. Someone shut it down now. I am talking, of course, of Wei, the BBC's cartoon character who is to start teaching Mandarin to our pre-schoolers. This is supposed to prepare us for the imminent overtaking of America by China as the world's leading superpower. What it is actually going to do is fatally weaken our already risible position. \"Really?\" you can imagine the Chinese saying (although, if you are already at primary school, not in their native language). \"You're giving us a bubble-headed, animated drawing teaching a bit of vocab via the TV, when what's needed is linguistic national service \u2013 great swaths of the population holed up for two years of tonal training in dedicated language centres, leaving just enough behind to keep afloat the few remaining functioning parts of your own economy [Greggs, the Daily Mail and Kate Middleton]? You're crap at making things you invented, exporting things you invented, building on and exploiting systems of industry you invented and \u2013 if we may anticipate summer 2012 \u2013 winning sports you invented, but suddenly, in the field of animated demagoguery, you are going to leave everyone in the dust? It looks bad, people. It looks as if you're not taking the whole thing seriously enough.\" In a way, you have to admire the BBC's optimism. We have lived next door to France (always). Ruled lots of France (sometimes). Been ruled by France (the other times). Fought with/against and holidayed in France. To say rien de sharing an alphabet and Indo-European heritage with French, making it vraiment quite simple de comprender, really. Yet, despite all this, as a nation we have resolutely, collectively et individually maintained that the best way to react on being confronted with the writing implement of an elderly female relative is to look up blankly and say, \"I have no idea who this pen belongs to.\" And still the Beeb wants to try to impart knowledge of an ideographic system to a subsection of these same people at an age when they are still habitually baffled by shoelaces. Evidently the public broadcasters' morale is not in nearly so parlous a state as in the education division of the public sector. If only schools had commercial arms turning Top Gear turds into gold, perhaps their passage through life would be smoother, too. I'm sorry, je digresse un peu. The point is, it looks bad, people. We're either going to look like an insecure bird/bloke trying to impress someone way out of our league (and by 2027 Britain is going to be lucky if it's Lembit Opik to China's Megan Fox), or bizarrely contemptuous of our future overlords. Either way, it can't end well. Still, in these straitened times, we must do the best with what we have. And if that's a toddlers' cartoon teaching vocab, well, let's at least ensure it's the right vocab. If anyone knows the Mandarin for \"Sorry\", \"Let me just move that for you\", \"Kowtow\" and \"I'll have my resignation letter on your desk by morning\", please let the BBC know as soon as possible. Merci buckets. \u2022 Lucy Mangan will be appearing at Guardian Open Weekend, held on 24 and 25 March.
