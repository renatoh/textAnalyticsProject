We now find that the case against the alleged perpetrators has been dropped. How similar this sounds to the Northern Bank robbery, where we wait in vain for any significant element of the republican movement to be linked, despite page after page in the media where their involvement was stated as a fact. People seem quite happy to point the finger at Gerry Adams as if he has actually done anything wrong. Is it his fault that the British Secret Services blackmailed a Sinn F\u00e9in member into betraying his comrades? Why should the revelation that a Sinn F\u00e9in member was acting for the British state give the Democratic Unionists another excuse not to sit down with Sinn F\u00e9in? As someone who does not share the politics of Sinn F\u00e9in, I still believe that they have a right to a fair hearing. Philip Foxe London Your leader on \"Stormontgate\" (December 19) strikes me as odd for two reasons. First, no comment is made on whether it is proper for the UK government to run agents inside political parties who seek and hold a democratic mandate. It may be that, given Sinn F\u00e9in's relationship with the IRA over the past decades, it is proper, but it is a question that deserves to be asked. Second, no advice is given to the politicians and citizens of Northern Ireland on how they are supposed to react to these recent developments. Members of all communities must be bemused by all of this - how can the crucial trust be re-established in the dark? The answer surely is that the story must be told. The UK government has been the chief agent for bringing the parties together and negotiating the way to peace, though as Peter Hain admitted recently, unpleasant corners have had to be turned on the road to the current situation. Now the government must take another groundbreaking step and reveal whether there was a spy-ring and, if so, whether it was instigated by UK agents. If not, why did the police make arrests and who gave them the false information; why were charges pressed, why were charges dropped? The situation is so confused and its resolution so important to the peace process that the government should again break with precedent and just tell all. Then the long and inconclusive inquiry you refer to need never happen. Dominic Rayner Leeds Entry to Stormont, management of British rule, IRA decommissioning and now spies. What chance someone in Sinn F\u00e9in being outed as an Irish republican? David Zafar Manchester"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
