Spurs remain the most likely suitors but Daniel Levy, the chairman, has no intention of becoming embroiled in a bidding war that leads to the club paying significantly more than the \u00a39m Portsmouth handed them to buy him 12 months ago. Around half of that transfer fee is still outstanding, strengthening Tottenham's position, and the north London club is also hopeful that the player's apparent desire to return to White Hart Lane will prove crucial. Villa and, should they enter the race, Manchester City could both offer a significantly bigger fee but Spurs reason that, with a disaffected player on their hands, Portsmouth could be forced to accept a lower bid if Defoe decides he wishes to go back to his former club. Portsmouth have accepted Defoe is keen to move. \"It looks like Jermain wants to go. That is something we will be speaking to him about,\" said Portsmouth's chief executive, Peter Storrie. \"If Jermain goes it will be at our price and if there is an offer which appeals. We have always said we do not keep people who do not want to play for Portsmouth. We do not have to sell anyone but if he wants to go that is a different matter.\" Martin O'Neill, the Villa manager, and Harry Redknapp, his Spurs counterpart, are desperate to increase their attacking options although the latter has said he will not be held to ransom. O'Neill has admitted to paying over the odds in the past, when he signed Ashley Young from Watford for \u00a39.5m two years ago, and he could be tempted to do the same with Defoe if Wigan prove resistant to his attempts to prise Emile Heskey from the JJB Stadium. Defoe's desire to quit Portsmouth is a further blow to the club following a chastening run that has seen Tony Adams's side suffer four consecutive defeats. Storrie insisted that there was no need for any further departures, with Lassana Diarra's transfer to Real Madrid already raising \u00a320m. Indeed, the Portsmouth chief executive suggested that Adams would be given the chance to improve his squad this month. \"I never talk about money,\" said Storrie, \"but Tony will be given the means if he wants to strengthen the squad. From talking to him I know he is looking to do most of his business in the summer. But we are still talking to people now and are looking to bring in two or three during the transfer window to improve the squad.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
