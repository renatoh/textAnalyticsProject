The Guardian understands that while Liverpool have not made a formal complaint, they have flagged up the chants from a minority of United fans in the club\u2019s post-match report to the FA, specifically the \u201calways the victims, it\u2019s never your fault\u201d chant \u2013 an offensive reference to the Hillsborough disaster \u2013 and references to \u201crats\u201d and \u201crobbers\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s something we are aware of and looking into,\u201d said the FA in a statement. Around 2,800 fans were present at Leigh Sports Village for the first WSL meeting between the two clubs. Asked about the chants, Liverpool\u2019s manager, Vicky Jepson, said her players had not been put off. \u201cThese chants about Scousers robbing and stuff \u2013 bring it on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe prepared for that. They\u2019re notorious for their chanting but it didn\u2019t bother me. My players and my staff were ready for that, so when they were shouting my name and shouting stuff, I just smiled. The main thing is that we came here to compete\u201d The United and Liverpool women\u2019s teams may not have the bitter history of their male counterparts but there is no love lost between the two sides. United\u2019s manager, Casey Stoney, who hung up her boots after one season on Merseyside, recruited heavily from her former club, taking seven players along the M62 to help build the spine of her new side. But it was the former Arsenal player Lauren James who stood out. On the eve of her 18th birthday \u2013 and days after her brother Reece scored on his first start for Chelsea against Grimsby \u2013 James\u2019s thundering strike past Anke Preuss and a Katie Zelem injury-time penalty earned United their precious first points and delivered a third consecutive league defeat for the visitors. Stoney later paid tribute, saying James can be \u201cas good as she wants to be \u2026 I think that was one of the hardest-working performances I\u2019ve seen from her. She knows what she is capable of and she has had great inspiration from her brother during the week. She is 18 tomorrow so we need to be patient with her. Yes, she\u2019s very composed, we know what she can do with the ball but for me, talent-wise, she is one of the best in her age group.\u201d Jepson was reflective. \u201cYes we lost, yes I\u2019m absolutely gutted because I hate losing, especially to United. But it was marginal. The last three league games have been marginal defeats.\u201d \u201cThe club have been made aware of reports of inappropriate chanting at yesterday\u2019s game and are looking into this,\u201d said Manchester United in a statement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
