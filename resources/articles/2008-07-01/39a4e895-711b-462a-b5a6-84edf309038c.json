Fareed Zakaria is in the second category. As the economies of China and India expand and their political reach extends, is America's position in the world threatened? This particular doctor says no, concluding that everything will be all right provided the patient lies down in a darkened room for a while, and, above all, thinks a little less about himself and a little more about other people. One of Zakaria's title chapters, \"The Rise of the Rest\", sums up his thesis. Other powers, notably India and China, are rising, but this does not mean, he argues, that America will lose the control of world affairs to which it is so accustomed. It will suffer some relative decline, but can still remain top nation, if it learns how to broker and mediate the relationships of other nations in the manner of Bismarck, and ceases to try to dictate in the manner of George W Bush, or even in the manner of Bill Clinton. The preoccupation with rise and fall is as old as power itself. Zakaria's \"Rise of the Rest\" is perhaps a reworking of the title of the Canadian-American historian William McNeil's fine world history The Rise of the West, published many years ago, the title of which in turn was probably a play on Oswald Spengler's Decline of the West. Gibbon, of course, lurks in the background. McNeil was influenced by Toynbee, a quotation from whom introduces Zakaria's book. Paul Kennedy's 1987 work The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, with its notion of imperial \"overstretch\", for a while had an almost mesmeric effect on Americans. Over recent years rise and decline books have come off the presses at a smart rate, with Samuel Huntingdon and Niall Ferguson among the more notable names. In the last couple of months, Bill Emmott, a former editor of the Economist, and Kishore Mahbubani, a Singaporean diplomat and scholar, have entered the fray with books on the rise of the Asian powers. In China, as Zakaria interestingly reveals, a recent television series on the great powers attracted large audiences. It has to be said that one's heart tends to sink as yet another rise and decline volume drops on the desk. Zakaria himself writes of a \"cottage industry of scaremongering\" in western countries since 9/11. Is Osama over? Will China blow up or grow up? Is India the future of IT? Is democracy dished, Russia resurgent, and Europe enfeebled? Is America at the crossroads? As writers jostle to produce one of those \"big ideas\" which seem to explain everything, it is tempting to conclude that there are easier ways of getting a headache, or to think wistfully of butterflies, or of children playing in the sun. The editor of Newsweek International, Zakaria is the author of a well received book on democracy which argued, at a time when the Bush administration was pouring out simplistic rhetoric, that the crude imposition of bits of democratic machinery would lead many societies in anything but a democratic direction. He brings a sharp mind and an eye for detail, example and anecdote to his task in his new book. His style is generally readable and succinct, although his occasional news magazine mannerisms can grate. Why should Burma be \"tiny\", for example? He also has a habit of announcing that something is not well-known when, like Admiral Zheng He's 15th-century voyages, it is very well known indeed. But he makes some good broader points in the declinist debate. One is that the parallel between Britain's slow dwindling and America's present difficulties is misleading. He suggests that Britain's empire was for a long time a well-managed bluff, while America's is an ill-managed but hard fact. He sensibly downgrades the threat from Islamist terror. He has unearthed educational statistics which indicate that Chinese and Indian figures for science and technical graduates are inflated, which leads him to conclude that higher education is America's best industry. He is good, too, on the decline of truly national politics in India, and on China's curious capacity to combine serious corruption with relatively high levels of competence. Yet there is not a word in his China chapter about Tibet or about the likelihood that China's plans for the future envisage the Hanification of that third of the country which is not Chinese. There is a kind of bias toward power as a phenomenon in his treatment of both India and China. And when it comes to America, even though the author clearly wants to see a more modest and skilful United States on the world scene, this bent is very apparent. Zakaria, who came to the US from India as a student and stayed to become a citizen, has drunk deeply from the exceptionalist cup. The intellectual quest for ways to ground American power is vital, for him, because America is uniquely necessary to the world. Even as he argues that other countries have their own interests and ideologies, he dismisses Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's \"insane rants\" and refers without explanation to Iran as a \"rogue state\". Surely there are questions here that should be answered rather than begged. His book ends with a sort of personal love letter to the US. It is therefore not surprising that he posits a best of all post-American worlds and a world that is still, in spite of his title, a very American one indeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
