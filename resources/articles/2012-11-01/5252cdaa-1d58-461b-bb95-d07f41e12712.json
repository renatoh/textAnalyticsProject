The 23-year-old's representative's attorney, Andreozzi &amp; Associates, said Tuesday: \"He wants it to be known that his sexual relationship with Mr Clash was an adult consensual relationship.\" The firm also represented the alleged sexual abuse victims of the Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky. Clash, who voices the character Elmo and who has been with Sesame Workshop for more than 30 years, took a leave of absence following the accusations. \"I am relieved that this painful allegation has been put to rest,\" Clash said in a statement. \"I will not discuss it further.\" Sesame Workshop told the New York Times: \"We are pleased that this matter has been brought to a close, and we are happy that Kevin can move on from this unfortunate episode.\" It did not indicate when he would be returning to the show. Sesame Workshop said in a statement Monday that the man had contacted the company in June and claimed that he was 16 when he began a relationship with Clash. The company spoke with the accuser and conducted its own investigation into his claims, which they could not substantiate. \"Kevin insists that the allegation of underage conduct is false and defamatory and he is taking actions to protect his reputation,\" said Sesame Workshop in a statement. \"We have granted him a leave of absence to do so.\" The company's investigation did reveal that Clash had \"exercised poor judgment and violated company policy regarding internet usage\". Sesame Workshop disciplined him for the behavior. Clash, who has won a number of Daytime Emmys for his performances on Sesame Street, was the subject of a 2011 documentary, Being Elmo: a Puppeteer's Journey, which showed how he helped to make Elmo an integral part of US television."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
