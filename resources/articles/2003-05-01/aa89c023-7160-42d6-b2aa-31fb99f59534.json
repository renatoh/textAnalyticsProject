Telegraph staff and regular casuals voted in overwhelmingly in favour of establishing a union. In the ballot 361 people voted for and just 34 voted against. \"We had to go through more than a year of legal wrangling over the details of the ballot; chapel officials had to withstand complaints and the company tried as hard as it could to get people to vote against,\" said Jeremy Dear, the national organiser of the NUJ. \"Yet 91% still said they wanted the NUJ. We now look forward to the company recognising the strength of feeling and working with us to improve pay, address casuals' concerns and tackle health and safety issues.\" Dear described the result as \"fantastic - the biggest and one of the most significant recognition agreements the NUJ has won for years\". The Telegraph tore up its agreements with the NUJ in the 90s as part of a wave of \"union derecognition\" that swept the newspaper industry in the wake of the Wapping dispute. Rupert Murdoch began the process with his decision to smash the print unions that had held his papers to ransom over the issue of overtime payments. The Telegraph ballot was held jointly with management under an agreement brokered by the government's central arbitration committee. The agreement took 15 months to reach. Dear said management had gone to great lengths to obstruct the union movement, for example preventing staff from using the Telegraph email system, which was guaranteed in the agreement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
