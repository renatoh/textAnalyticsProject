When they realise they have a runaway hit on their hands a horrified Mostel turns to Wilder and pleads: \"Where did we go right?\" If Newcastle avoid relegation this weekend their supporters will be asking themselves the same question. Which is why, like many football folk, I will not be sorry if Newcastle are relegated on Sunday. After all, they have worked so single-mindedly and assiduously for this defining moment. They have pieced together the wrong owners, the wrong executives, the wrong managers and the wrong players. When \u2013 by accident it seemed \u2013 they discovered that a brilliant goalkeeper was retrieving some of the many gaffes by their awful back four they flogged him to Manchester City. The famously massed ranks of their supporters deserve more than this, even though they are flawed too, regarding United as a greater club than they truly are. Newcastle haven't won an important domestic trophy since 1955. This is a big-ish club, not one of the giants of the contemporary game. The black and white replica shirts seem symbolically linked to another, black and white era, to Jackie Milburn and post-war rationing, that austere period in British life when, as our own Michael Billington observed in his terrific read, State of the Nation, it felt as though a great war had been lost instead of won. But rations were never as tight as they now are in Toonland. For all that support just five games out of 19 have been won at home, 22 points taken out of a possible 57. They have conceded as many goals at home, 29, as they have away. And away from home they have won just twice. If Newcastle fall this weekend don't praise their opponents, Aston Villa, or the desperate survival instincts of Middlesbrough, Sunderland or Hull. Newcastle should take all the credit for seeing their concentrated efforts achieve such an appropriate conclusion. The shrewd guidance of Freddy Shepherd and now Mike Ashley (not forgetting the expert efforts of Dennis Wise, as executive director) have taken the club to this precipice. Ashley may have led the club out of debt but he won't be remembered for that if he marches them into the Championship. His biggest mistake, and there have been many, was the appointment of Wise, who chose not to live in the north-east and, ultimately, not even attend matches there. Wise, remember, bought Spanish flop Xisco for \u00a35.8m and those summer purchases of Jon\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez (\u00a34.5m) and Fabricio Coloccini (\u00a310m) are only remembered fondly by supporters of arch rivals Sunderland and Middlesbrough. Now Alan Shearer, whose communication skills and tactical insight were closely guarded secrets during his sofa stint on Match of the Day, must rescue them. Shearer, remember, is their fourth manager this season. When he arrived it was stated that he would be there for only eight games before returning to the warmth of the television studio, hardly a message to inspire an already demoralised club. Just when Newcastle needed a football manager they turned instead to a personality, a former great player. Football management is littered with the failures of former great players, such as Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton, Bryan Robson and Milburn himself. After Kevin Keegan, Joe Kinnear and Chris Hughton were unable to lift the club out of danger this season, Ashley turned, at the last minute, to a man who had never done the job before in his life and who had seemed singularly reluctant to take up the challenge. Newcastle are a complete mess on and off the field, an object lesson in how a football club should not be run. Now they are looking to Michael Owen to save them, a striker so out of form that he has scored just once this year. Which is why, if they do manage to get out of their desperate hole on Sunday \u2013 and they must get a better result than Hull \u2013 their supporters would be entitled to invoke the famous words of Mr Mostel. Symonds' omission a boon for injury-prone WatsonAndrew Symonds has a fondness for fishing in which he will be able to indulge properly in the coming months. You can imagine him sportfishing like Hemingway and wrestling with giant marlin when he is not conducting bizarre radio interviews. He has been dumped twice for behavioural issues and with fitness problems too, and with his 34th birthday looming next month this could be the end for him in the big time. His omission from the Ashes squad yesterday was a surprise only inasmuch as Ricky Ponting has batted for him as fiercely as he has batted for Australia over the years. But Symonds' disappointment will be more than matched by the delight for Shane Watson, a cricketer of real talent but one who has seemed as vulnerable to injury as Humpty Dumpty. Phyllis Diller once said: \"I'm at an age when my back goes out more often than I do.\" Watson has seen so many of his body parts go out that he has played just eight Test matches and will soon be 28. If it wasn't his back it was his calf or his hamstring and he even suffered a suspected heart attack, although that turned out to be food poisoning. His frailties have tended to undermine the picture of hulky strength and virile fitness, with spiky blond hair and dark glasses, that he would prefer to present to the world. But if the all-rounder plays in the Ashes this summer \u2013 and he has a chance because there is no specialist cover for the established batsmen \u2013 England will be wary of him, for he is one of the cleanest hitters in the game as well as a useful bowler. If he does come off, showing some of the talent that once saw him smite an unbeaten 300 before taking 7-29 in a club game, it will be not only cricket that will rejoice but the cricket world in general. Wenger an asset for England to cherishThe decision by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, football's Le Professeur, to remain with Arsenal is not their good fortune alone. The English game should be celebrating the fact that those miserable shareholders from last week's angry question and answer meeting at the Emirates have been seen off and the most intelligent, articulate and enlightened manager in the domestic game will continue his great work. Yet Wenger will know that it is not enough to be known as Arsenal's greatest ever manager, that nothing has been won for four seasons, that he can't go on producing sides always young and always promising a golden future. He has shown a stubbornness, a reluctance to buy much-needed experience even when funds have been available. The rude shareholders might have helped drive home the message. It was easy and successful for Wenger at first, evoking the words of Julian Barnes who, in Talking It Over, likened life to invading Russia. \"A blitz start, massed shakos, plumes dancing like a flustered henhouse; a period of svelte progress recorded in ebullient despatches as the enemy falls back. \"Then the beginning of a long morale-sapping trudge with rations getting shorter and the first snowflakes on your face.\" Snow has been flecking Wenger's gaunt features for some time now. Calling all boresA bore has been defined as a man who, when you ask him how he is, tells you. Or as someone who talks when you want him to listen. We've all met them. Or been them. Well, a pal who is not renowned for his glacial patience has just given me a piece of advice which is worth passing on. \"When you are really trapped and can't see an easy escape route,\" says my mate, \"just reach for your pocket, urgently, and tell your antagonist, 'I think I can feel my mobile phone vibrating'. \"Apologise, and walk away for privacy while talking to yourself on your mobile. You can also look at your watch, sharply, for extra dramatic effect.\" It works. But only if you've remembered your mobile."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
