Hussain, whose place in the side was under serious pressure following the emergence of Andrew Strauss, oozed all his old rugged defiance to take England to 282 for 3 after they had slipped to 35 for 2 early on. With nine needed to win, Hussain sealed the match in grand manner. First he dumped Chris Martin over mid-on to move to 98, then laced the next ball through the covers to bring up his century, before finishing the match with another cover-drive. As if he wasn't under enough pressure already, Hussain ran out Strauss - 17 short of becoming the first Englishman to make two centuries on his Test debut - after a dreadful mix-up. But Hussain and old friend Graham Thorpe took England to victory with a superb unbroken fourth-wicket partnership of 139. Such a comfortable margin of victory looked unlikely when New Zealand bossed the early stages of the final day. Marcus Trescothick was caught acrobatically by Daryl Tuffey in his follow-through and Mark Butcher, soon after surviving a huge appeal for a bat-pad catch, wafted outside off stump and was well taken by Stephen Fleming at first slip. But Strauss was cool and calm for the most part, and there are few people as well-equipped for such a hard-boiled contest as Hussain. Slowly, surely England took control - and they did not lose their grip, even after the farcical run-out of Strauss, the Man of the Match. Quite who England will leave out when Michael Vaughan returns is a mystery. But that is a problem for tomorrow; this match was about the birth of Strauss as an international cricketer of some quality, and the reaffirmation of all that is good about Hussain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
