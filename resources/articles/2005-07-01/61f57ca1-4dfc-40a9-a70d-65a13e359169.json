Such Saturday afternoon scenes are far from remarkable in London and yet these are strange times in the capital and this was an extraordinary occasion. George Bush would have choked on his burger. True, it does seem odd to think of an English side lining up against the national team of Iran - perhaps 10 years ago it would have been unthinkable - but sport has an ability to transcend divides as well as to reinforce them and this was an example of the former. The nation ranked 15th in the world marked their qualification for the 2006 World Cup by flying in a team of reserves to play matches against QPR, Millwall and Portsmouth, but they cannot have known the added significance that would become attached to them. Had Pele been present he might have regurgitated past speeches on the universal language of the game. Ken Livingstone may yet use this as an example of how \"London's diverse communities exist side by side and will not be divided by terrorism\". In their absence, though, the QPR manager Ian Holloway provided the wisdom and it was from the heart. \"First of all sport wins, doesn't it? I just feel that everybody in the stadium showed what the world is about. The world's about people. It's not about certain attitudes of people who hide behind certain banners to cause trouble. I just wish that we could live together in the harmony that this world deserves.\" Iran's final World Cup group match is against Japan next month and it is unlikely that they will face such a physical encounter as that provided by QPR. Once the home side had discovered the spoils to be had from exploiting their extra height there was little Iran could do. Paul Furlong opened the scoring when he nodded in off the post. After half-time Gareth Ainsworth did the same and Georges Santos then made it three. The set-pieces delighted Holloway but left Iran's management blustering about \"typical English\" tactics. Some things never change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
