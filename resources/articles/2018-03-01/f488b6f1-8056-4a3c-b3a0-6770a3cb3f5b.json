Spot on with the actual venue, though. Like Sir Lancelot at Camelot, and Sir Alex at Old Trafford, Sir Bruce belongs at the London Palladium. It was practically home (even if Wentworth was his actual home; handier for the golf). Tess Daly, co-host when he lived, has to go it alone tonight, dressed in sparkly black to reflect the mood \u2013 sad, but also celebratory. It\u2019s a glitzy and starry occasion as well. It was filmed last month on the eve of what would have been Brucie\u2019s 90th birthday. He\u2019s here tonight, though, in the spirit of the show, and in everybody\u2019s hearts, of course. Adam Garcia, accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra, taps through some career highlights \u2013 The Generation Game, Play Your Cards Right, Strictly Come Dancing \u2013 alongside a dance routine that ends up with his strongman/Rodin\u2019s-Thinker pose. Bruce was a strong man, and a thinker. Also a man of the people, says Tess. And here are some people \u2013 in Blackpool, Glasgow and Cardiff \u2013 to confirm it. \u201cHe made you feel like he was in the room with you.\u201d \u201cHe had that aura.\u201d \u201cHe was a national treasure.\u201d And they too do the Thinker, or say: \u201cGood game, good game.\u201d Michael Grade says he was generous, loyal and hard-working. Michael Ball and Alfie Boe sing a medley of his Sinatra favourites. Ant and Dec say he made it look easy when it isn\u2019t. More interestingly, Ant says Bruce used to get annoyed with contestants. Yes, he did! On The Generation Game. He would move them round, physically, then give the camera that look. Dec has got a photograph of the three of them on stage, he says, and he chokes up a little. There\u2019s quite of a lot of that, choking up a little. Jon Culshaw\u2019s on catchphrases, and didn\u2019t he do \u2026 you know how he did. There\u2019s more singing from Dame Shirley B, and words from Sir Elton J, Sir Lenny H, Sir Michael P and Dame Joan C. It\u2019s like a modern day Camelot, a round table of light entertainment; each paying their respects and expressing their love for a recently departed knight. Sir Elton says it took Bruce far too long to get his knighthood. \u201cWe were all knocking on that door for him and eventually he got it,\u201d he says. That\u2019s how it works; those who have already it knock on the door \u2013 or the palace gates \u2013 until they open up and let Bruce in. Nice to see you, ma\u2019am ... Sir Lenny has a nice line: \u201cHe was a force of nature blowing through my entire childhood.\u201d It was the same for everyone and their parents and their children. Best is from the (as yet) unknighted Paul Merton, recounting the time Bruce came on Have I got News For You in 2003. Remember? Of course you do. \u201cWell, it will be nice to see them, to see them \u2026\u201d said Brucie, about Saddam\u2019s supposed weapons of mass destruction. And that was followed by a game of Play Your Iraqi Cards Right. \u201cEight of spades, deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz \u2026\u201d Brilliant. Interesting what Paul M says about Brucie being nervous before going on HIGNFY, as he wasn\u2019t sure of what a slightly high-brow audience would make of him. He needn\u2019t have worried, of course, it was the greatest episode ever. But these were in Brucie\u2019s wilderness years, before the Strictly Come Back. He might have retired earlier and never had that brilliant final act. It goes to show how random it all is, and how much chance is involved. If Bruce Forsyth hadn\u2019t become what Elton describes as \u201cprobably our finest all-round entertainer of all time,\u201d you can imagine him as one of the people himself, someone\u2019s grandad, the one who likes a joke and a sing and dance, has pinpoint timing and enjoys an audience. It was an extraordinary career: 75 years from Boy Bruce the Mighty Atom. He\u2019s in the Guinness World Records for having the longest TV career of any male in the world. There are further starry memories, from Claudia Winkleman, Bruno Tonioli and Darcey Bussell, Len Goodman and Anton de Beke. Jimmy Tarbuck and Russ Abbott are quoted, as are Rosemarie Ford and Alesha Dixon, Gary Lineker and Alan Sugar. Brucie somehow supported both Arsenal and Spurs and got away with it. That\u2019s a feat in itself. Lady Forsyth \u2013 Wilnelia, once Miss World, then the love of Bruce\u2019s life \u2013 is here with a big thank you, for everyone. Then more songs, lights, dancing, keep dancing. A fitting tribute, I think he would have enjoyed it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
