He warned that America\u2019s \u201cvery democracy\u201d was at stake in the 2020 election. \u201cIt is not all the fault of the incumbent president but it has been exacerbated significantly by his conduct and behavior,\u201d Biden said, according to a pool report. He warned that another term for Trump would \u201cliterally fundamentally change the nature of who we are and how we function\u201d. Phew! That was a lot. Trump spoke for nearly an hour and a half, the crowd having also sat through Mike Pence and both older Trump brothers. So what did we learn? Well, the president promised to cure cancer, but assuming that isn\u2019t going to happen, here are some takeaways. \u2022 Socialism will be front and center in 2020 Mike Pence introduced Trump, and the vice-president used his speech to hammer away at the Democrats, repeatedly accusing them \u2013 apparently all of them \u2013 of being \u201csocialists\u201d. \u201cIt was freedom, not socialism that ended slavery [and] won two wars,\u201d Pence said. Trump used almost the same line, and Republicans in Congress are following suit. It\u2019s an approach Republicans seem determined to hammer home ahead of next year\u2019s election. \u2022It\u2019s the economy \u2026 Trump\u2019s touting of the economy\u2019s success brought big cheers. And by most measures, the economy is doing well. Unemployment is low, and GDP growth \u2013 seen as one of the best indicators of an economy\u2019s health \u2013 is high. Of course, Trump being Trump, when he did discuss the economy, he lied anyway, falsely claiming the US has the lowest unemployment rate in history and exaggerating GDP growth. But all the warm-up acts before Trump focussed on the economy, an issue Republicans can paint as a success, and Trump\u2019s campaign would probably prefer him to do the same. \u2022Immigration will remain an issue for Trump The president attacked Democrats as \u201cunhinged\u201d and blamed their inaction for the situation at the border, claiming that undocumented immigrants are \u201cpouring in\u201d. He also attacked Democrats over sanctuary cities and \u2013 as one would expect \u2013 brought up the border wall, claiming 400 miles of it will be built by the end of next year. The problem is most of that is only going to replacing existing wall. But will his supporters care? \u2022Trump has no plans to turn forward the clock A lot of this speech could have been given two years ago \u2013 and some parts of it four years ago. Launching his re-election campaign in theory gave Trump a chance for a fresh start, and to set new goals for a second term. Instead he seemed happiest when he was discussing Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u2013 inspiring the \u201cLock her up!\u201d chant \u2013 and talking about his 2016 victory. \u2022A big crowd in Orlando ... but early departures Trump said he would fill the Amway Center, which has a capacity of a little under 20,000, and fill it he did. The crowd cheered the president wildly when he emerged, and his largest applause lines \u2013 criticizing the press, making false claims about wall-building \u2013 got big cheers. But Trump spoke for almost an hour and a half, and well before then some people had begun to trickle out. This was quite something: Bernie Sanders is giving an immediate rebuttal to Trump\u2019s speech, and he\u2019s not holding back. Watching Trump for the past hour and a half was an \u201cextremely unpleasant experience\u201d, Sanders says. He describes the speech as \u201clies, distortions, and total absolute nonsense\u201d, and criticizes Trump for not talking about the climate emergency, or that: \u201cHalf of the people in this country are working paycheck to paycheck.\u201d Neeaarrly done. Trump says: \u201cWe have been blessed by God with the greatest nation on the face of the earth, and we are going to keep it that way.\u201d His team is going to keep on working, he says, and: \u201cWe are going to keep on fighting and we\u2019re going to keep on winning, winning, winning.\u201d America will be kept great again, Trump promises. Then he finally leaves the stage. I think he was up there for nearly an hour and a half. Trump is running through some of the things he will achieve in a second term. Some are more realistic than others. \u201cWe will come up with the cures to many many problems to many, many diseases including cancer,\u201d Trump says. (That\u2019s one of the less realistic pledges.) He adds: \u201cWe will eradicate Aids in America and we\u2019re very close\u201d. School choices will be given to those who want to move send their kids to different schools. Trump will defend religious freedom and the right to bear arms. Trump says his administration will be attempting things that no one else has ever attempted before. \u201cWait until you see some of the things you\u2019ll hear about in the next few months,\u201d Trump teases. That\u2019s what I say to my boss when he asks why I haven\u2019t written anything in weeks. Trump moves on to criticizing \u201cCrazy Bernie Sanders\u201d. Then he repeats the socialist shtick Pence tested out earlier, painting Democrats as socialists. Trump says Americans don\u2019t believe in socialism, \u201cthey believe in freedom\u201d. This line gets a big cheer, but in general the crowd seem to have lost a little energy. People aren\u2019t exactly streaming out of the venue, but I can definitely see plenty of gaps in the crowd. (It was full earlier.) We probably shouldn\u2019t read too much into this, as it\u2019s been a very long day, but some people are leaving. Trump, who has been speaking for an hour, devotes some time to the opioid crisis. \u201cWe have made so much progress,\u201d Trump says. He says the rate of abuse is dropping by double-digit figures in some places. The president then runs through some easy applause topics. Veterans. The US defeating other countries. On to the Democrats. The Democratic party has become \u201cmore unhinged\u201d than at any point in history, Trump says. They are weak on the border, he laments. Immigrants are \u201cpouring in\u201d. Trump continues. He passed the largest tax cut in history, he says. This is absolutely not true. The Washington Post gives Trump four Pinocchios for this claim: Trump\u2019s tax cut is only the eighth largest \u2014 and is even smaller than two of Barack Obama\u2019s tax cuts. A huge cheer for Sarah Sanders, the outgoing White House press secretary. She said earlier this would be her last campaign event, and she is on Fox News a lot \u2013 two things that might account for that one. Then the press secretary speaks. Huckabee-Sanders is grateful for her chance to be on \u201cthe front row of history\u201d, she said. Trump is \u201cgoing to have an incredible six more years\u201d. Then, after this five minute praising of Trump\u2019s family and staff, the president takes the microphone back, and dives into campaign mode. His administration has added jobs, Trump says. He says almost 160 million people are working, and that there are more women in jobs than ever. (Factcheck.org rates this claim as \u201clacking context\u201d.) Trump might be wrapping up. It\u2019s all gone a bit freeform. He\u2019s literally just listing members of his family. Trump runs through a few grandchildren\u2019s names. His family are \u201cgreat\u201d, he says. Then he gives a shout out to Lindsay Graham. The crowd goes wild for Lindsay Graham, which \u2013 having witnessed his own presidential bid in 2016 \u2013 is something I never thought I\u2019d write. Trump is pondering whether to retain the slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d or \u201cKeep America Great\u201d. He puts it to a crowd vote. The crowd has to cheer for which one they want. It seems to me that \u2018Keep America Great\u2019 is the clear winner. He did the exact same thing at a rally in Pennsylvania last month, putting it to a crowd vote. People preferred Keep America Great there, too. Time to throw away those Maga hats! Trump claims the US has the lowest unemployment rate in the history of the country. It\u2019s a lie. The unemployment rate was 3.6% in May, but the unemployment rate was as low as 2.5% in 1953. It was below 3.9% for much of 1951, 1952 and 1953. The unemployment rate was as low as 3.4% in 1968 and 1969 and was 3.8 percent in 2000. So the unemployment rate is good, but not the lowest ever. (Also, the US created only 75,000 new jobs in May, much weaker than the 175,000 expected.) On to tariffs. Trump\u2019s tariffs on China are working, he says. Companies are leaving China. And by the way, \u201cwhen the fake news tells you that you\u2019re paying\u201d, Trump says, people shouldn\u2019t listen. \u201cYou\u2019re not paying very much if you\u2019re paying anything at all,\u201d he says, tacitly admitting that the public is paying for his tariffs. Trump is talking about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. So much for looking forward. No prizes for guessing what the crowd chant. The president says had he deleted emails he would have been come down on, hard. \u201cIf I delete one email, like a lovenote to Melania, it\u2019s the electric chair for Trump,\u201d the president speculates. Someone should make a film where two people build a relationship solely through email communication. Maybe Tom Hanks could play the male lead. Instead of bringing America together, Democrats want us \u201csplintered\u201d and \u201cdivided\u201d, Trump says. That\u2019s a bit rich. A chant goes up. It\u2019s an old favorite: \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d \u201cWe are building the wall,\u201d Trump says. He says 400 miles of new wall will be built by the end of 2020. (Fact-checkers mostly agree that this is a lie. Politifact says most projects only replace existing barriers.) Trump continues expressing anger at the investigation into his campaign. He is genuinely angry about the Mueller investigation, which he believes is overreach, but judging by the way this thread is going down with the crowd, Trump is probably aware that complaining about the investigation could be fertile ground for his campaign. The president then extrapolates the perceived injustices he has suffered. Trump says that the people who are attacking him \u2013 through investigations and inquiries, are really attacking \u201cyou\u201d. \u201cThey wanted to deny you the future that you demanded and the future that America deserves and now is getting,\u201d Trump tells the crowd, deploying questionable grammar. \u201cThey want to destroy you and ... destroy our country as we know it.\u201d This is the section of the speech where Trump says there was \u201cno collusion and no obstruction\u201d. He\u2019s talking about the Russia investigation into his campaign, of course. As you\u2019ll remember, special counsel Robert Mueller actually identified at least 10 instances of potential obstructions of justice committed by Trump. Trump repeats that there was spying on his campaign during 2016. (His attorney general, Bill Barr, recently equivocated when asked if Trump\u2019s claim was true.) He sticks to the topic. \u201cNobody\u2019s been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump,\u201d Trump third-persons. Anyone remember Helsinki? Trump is talking about how his administration has drained the swamp. His government \u201cstared down\u201d the line of lobbyists and other clingers on in Washington DC, he says. This is nonsense. In March the Washingon Post identified \u201cover 350 individuals who\u2019ve worked as lobbyists who currently work in the administration, have worked in it or have been nominated to serve in Trump\u2019s administration\u201d. The 2016 election was a \u201cdefining moment\u201d in history, Trump says. But instead of focus on that positive, he attacks the press. \u201cAsk them right there,\u201d he adds. He means us lot in the press pen, right in the middle of the stadium. Loud boos from the crowd, followed by chants of \u201cCNN sucks\u201d. \u201cBy the way, that is a lot of fake news back there,\u201d Trump says. More boos. Trump is really on one against the media tonight. Trump begins his speech with one of his favorite subjects: crowd sizes. When he was planning this event, \u201cI said this is a very big arena\u201d, Trump tells the crowd. He speculates that if he had failed to fill all the seats the \u201cfake news\u201d (this prompts boos) would have criticized him. But instead, he has filled it, Trump says. He has started a movement, Trump says. A movement made up of people who \u201clove their country, love their flag, love their children, and believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first\u201d. Straight in with the nationalism from the president. Trump is wearing his traditional big suit and red tie, Melania Trump is clad all in yellow. She gives Trump a brief introduction, saying they pair are looking forward to another six years. The crowd goes wild. Democrats these days only offer socialism, Pence lies. \u201cBut it was freedom, not socialism that ended slavery [and] won two wars,\u201d the vice-president says. This painting Democrats as socialists \u2013 a scary concept to some voters \u2013 is a tactic Republicans have already started to use ahead of the 2020 election, and we can expect to hear lots more of that talk. Trump promised to revive the economy, the vice-president recalls: \u201cAnd President Trump delivered.\u201d Jobs are back, confidence is back, \u201cand thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump, America is back\u201d, Pence says. But we must fight to re-elect the president, Pence warns. This prompts a full-throated chant of \u201cfour more years\u201d from the crowd. Pence isn\u2019t a particularly charismatic speaker, but I guess after you\u2019ve been waiting around for half a day with only Eric Trump for entertainment, he\u2019s better than nothing. Mike Pence has arrived. He\u2019s with his wife Karen. The pair of them are here for one reason and one reason only, Pence says: to secure four more years of Trump. Pence, never one to hide his admiration for his boss, describes Trump as \u201cthe real deal\u201d. The vice-president runs through some of Trump\u2019s foreign policy moves: specifically spending more on the military, and taking on Isis. The loudest applause is when Pence mentions Trump moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Mexico has done more in the past ten days to improve conditions at the border than the Democrats have ever done in Congress, according to Pence. That\u2019s because of Trump\u2019s pressure, he says. Some of the Democratic 2020 candidates are getting in last minute shots as Trump prepares to take to the stage. Here\u2019s Joe Biden\u2019s campaign manager, according to a report from AP: \u201cDonald Trump is launching his campaign for re-election tonight and the American people face a choice - we can make Trump an aberration or let him fundamentally and forever alter the character of this nation,\u201d said Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager for Democratic front-runner Joe Biden. And this is Bernie Sanders, doing the job in person: There\u2019s a bit of a lull in the crowd as we wait for Trump to arrive. People were doing a Mexican wave for a bit, but they\u2019ve given up now. The music isn\u2019t helping: we just had the slow plod of Candle in the Wind by Elton John, which was problematic in more ways than one given Trump\u2019s past lewd comments about Princess Diana. It was rocking in here earlier though: That Trump has chosen to launch his campaign in central Florida is no coincidence. The famed I-4 corridor that stretches from the Tampa Bay region in the west, across citrus country through Orlando and to Daytona Beach in the east, is rich in votes that broke well for him in 2016. Six million voters live in the 19 counties that make up two of the state\u2019s biggest television markets \u2013 in Tampa and Orlando \u2013 and with the exception of Orange County, one of the lone deep blue states in a sea of red, the region delivered for Trump. He won the I-4 corridor by 217,000 votes from Hillary Clinton, despite losing in the rest of the state by 100,000. Statewide in 2016, Trump polled 4,617,886 votes to Clinton\u2019s 4,504,975, an advantage of little more than 1%. Yet in Orange county, Clinton won more than 60% of the vote. \u201cPresident Trump needs to keep the blue collar, democratic working class voters voting for him,\u201d said Anthony Pedicini, a GOP strategist for Florida. \u201cMost Florida counties except the big blue counties are still center right places and once you get back into the presidential election with an 85% turnout you\u2019re going to see those counties swing back center right. The region as a whole is a huge bellwether.\u201d Naturally, Florida\u2019s Democrats do not agree. The party conducted its own poll among a sample of Orlando voters ahead of the president\u2019s visit and found that about 70% disapproved of Trump\u2019s job performance. In addition, only 28% said they would vote for him if the election was held today, 72% said Trump has not done enough to make health care affordable and only 30% said Trump has done enough to help the people of Puerto Rico. Donald Trump has arrived in Orlando. According to the White House pool reporter, the president and Melania Trump were greeted by Florida governor Ron DeSantis and Jason Pirozzolo, a board member of the Greater Orlando aviation authority board. Some scenes from the demonstration against Trump, currently happening in downtown Orlando: Donald Trump kicked off his trip to Florida by again suggesting that the wrongfully convicted teenagers in the Central Park Five case are guilty, and declining to apologise for taking out print ads in 1989 that called for their execution. The case has been thrust into the limelight again with the release of Oscar-nominated director Ava DuVernay\u2019s Netflix series When They See Us, a fictionalised re-examination of the affair that gripped New York in the late 1980s. Before any of the five teenagers, all black or Hispanic, had been tried over the brutal rape of a white woman in Central Park, Trump, then a Manhattan real-estate tycoon, took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty to be reinstated in New York state. Those involved in the case later said Trump\u2019s ads had a significant impact on the trial and contributed to the wrongful conviction. On Tuesday, as Trump headed to Orlando to launch his campaign for re-election, he was asked by reporters if he would apologise for his role in the saga. The president responded: \u201cWhy do you bring that question up now? It\u2019s an interesting time to bring it up. You have people on both sides of that. They admitted their guilt. If you look at Linda Fairstein, and you look at some of the prosecutors, they think that the city should never have settled that case. So, we\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d Donald Trump Jr takes the stage. It\u2019s two sons for the price of one! Trump Jr is touting the 3.2% GDP growth during the first quarter of 2019. Trump Jr asks if anyone remembers that happening in 2016. (The crowd intimates that they do not.) Barack Obama told people in 2016 that there was \u201cno magic wand\u201d to spur GDP growth, Trump Jr says. But it turns out there is a magic wand to get 3.2% GDP, Trump Jr continues. \u201cIt\u2019s commonsense. It\u2019s experience.\u201d *A couple of points here: GDP growth was not 3.2% in the first quarter of the year. It was 3.1%. Also: GDP growth hit 5.1% and 4.9% in two quarters in 2014, when Barack Obama was president. The lesser-spotted Eric Trump, second son of Donald Trump, has just been giving a speech. Eric says he is \u201cpretty sure\u201d that everyone in the arena \u201cis with the Republicans\u201d. He talks about the \u201cbitterness and Trump Jr says he has learnt just how bad the media is. He points to the middle of the room, where about 100 of us fake newsers are gathered, and says while he was aware of journalists before his dad ran for office, he never knew \u201chow dishonest they were\u201d. \u201cOur family is going to fight like hell for this country,\u201d Eric Trump continues. He says Trump is building the wall, which he isn\u2019t really, and the crowd cheers. While Donald Trump Jr is a regular surrogate for his father on the campaign trail, we don\u2019t usually see much of Eric. Good for him. No welcome mat is being rolled out for Trump by Florida\u2019s Democrats, who have attacked the president\u2019s choice of venue for the launch party. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Donald Trump has the audacity to begin his reelection campaign in central Florida, home to thousands of my fellow Puerto Ricans,\u201d said Darren Soto, a US congressman who represents parts of Orlando and Kissimmee, to which tens of thousands evacuated from Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in September 2017. \u201cDonald Trump is no friend to the Puerto Rican community in Florida or on the island. More than 3,000 people dying, the longest blackout in modern history, and you can\u2019t forget the images of him showing up in San Juan after the hurricane and casually tossing paper towels to victims of this terrible disaster.\u201d Soto, the first congressman of Puerto Rican descent, who was re-elected by a substantial margin in last November\u2019s midterms thanks in part to the large number of islanders who have relocated to central Florida, blamed Trump for holding up disaster relief resources both to Puerto Rico and the Florida Panhandle, which was ravaged by Hurricane Michael last October. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sickened to think that now he\u2019s showing up in our state to ask for another term. The people of Florida, the people of central Florida, the people of the Panhandle, deserve better, and we will give them that.\u201d Terrie Rizzo, the chair of the Florida Democratic Party, spoke at a rival rally to Trump\u2019s at the nearby Stonewall bar in Orlando. \u201cImmigrants make our state and our country stronger, you insult and belittle us,\u201d she said in comments directed at Trump. \u201cWe know what Donald Trump is going to say today, same old lies he always does. But we have a message for Donald Trump: In 2020 Florida will defeat you.\u201d Andrew Gillum, who was narrowly beaten by Republican Ron DeSantis in the race for Florida Governor in November, echoed Rizzo\u2019s words in a statement. \u2018Florida is the one state that can single-handedly deny Donald Trump reelection,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump is nervous because he knows it. That\u2019s why he is here to kick off what is sure to be a rally and a campaign full of insults, name-calling and appeals to the worst side of his base.\u201d The music has stopped, but Trump isn\u2019t due on stage for two hours, so there\u2019s a long list of dignitaries picking up the slack. I\u2019ve just been listening to a fire and brimstone address from an extremely angry pastor here at the Amway Center. She is praying that Trump will be able to overcome every \u201cevil political strategy\u201d being sent from \u201cfrom hell\u201d. Later on Mike Pence will be giving a talk, and possibly Donald Trump Jr might have something to say. As an aside: we\u2019re not exactly in Trump country here. Orlando is pretty safe Democratic territory \u2013 Clinton won the city\u2019s Orange County by 59.8% of the vote in 2016, to Trump\u2019s 35.4% \u2013 and it\u2019s unlikely Trump is hoping to win the city itself. But the state of Florida will be key to his re-election hopes. Trump eeked past Clinton by 1.2 points in 2016, and the state\u2019s 29 electoral college votes will be crucial. (Trump\u2019s support is strongest in Florida\u2019s more rural areas, particularly in the north-east of the state.) Internal polls leaked from the Trump campaign last week showed Trump seven points behind Joe Biden in Florida, so it makes sense that Trump is focussing on the Sunshine State. A number of Proud Boys, the far-right organization listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, has descended on Orlando before Trump\u2019s campaign launch. Videos from journalists in the downtown area shows men marching through the city chanting, among other things, \u201cProud Boys are here\u201d and flashing racist hand gestures: The Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe reports that a number of Proud Boys members were stopped from invading a peaceful rally at a popular LBGTQ bar close to the Amway Center. Several dozen members of the rightwing organization marched from the arena towards the Stonewall bar on Church Street, shouting anti-Democratic Party and pro-USA chants and with some displaying white power symbols on their clothing and banners. The Florida Democratic party is holding a Win With Love rally at the bar to counter the Trump event, with live music and local politicians and community leaders scheduled to address the crowd in the early evening. A number of Orlando police officers who were positioned outside the bar intercepted the group of Proud Boys and placed their bicycles as a barrier across the street. The officers asked them to head back in the direction of the Amway Center. There was no violence or confrontation between the rival groups and the Proud Boys group moved off again after a few minutes. The Amway Center is slowly filling up, with entrants treated to an eclectic playlist that has so far included Celine Dion\u2019s My Heart Will Go On, Queen\u2019s We Are The Champions, and Macho Man by Village People. Appropriately enough, the most recent event here was a musical concert by the band Twenty One Pilots \u2013 part of their Bandito tour. According to Wikipedia, Billboard reckoned the Bandito tour was a \u201cmust-see performance\u201d. Critics were said to be impressed by \u201cthe band\u2019s stunts during the set which included leaping, backflipping, vertical crowd-surfing, suspended bridge walking and scaffolding scaling\u201d. We\u2019re unlikely to see any of that tonight. On Friday, once they\u2019ve cleaned up from this shindig, the Amway Center will host the Mascot Games. Amway\u2019s website says it will feature \u201capproximately 30 mascots from sports teams across the country competing in a variety of games\u201d. Apparently some of the games will be gladiator themed. Drenched by thunderstorms and the searing humidity of a Florida summer afternoon, thousands of Donald Trump supporters were snaking through the streets outside Orlando\u2019s Amway Center on Tuesday ahead of tonight\u2019s rally. A sea of red MAGA hats lent color to the gray skies and black clouds, which has also prevented the Baby Trump blimp \u2013 a staple of recent protests against the US President - from taking flight outside the Stonewall bar, a popular LBGTQ hangout nearby where a rival rally hosted by Florida\u2019s Democratic Party was taking place. Franklin Hughes, a Trump supporter selling MAGA 2020 merchandise close to the 20,000-capacity Amway, lamented that the constant rain was losing him business. \u201cIt\u2019s been very quiet,\u201d said Hughes, from Columbia, South Carolina, as dozens of Trump supporters raced past him in ponchos. Hundreds of police officers ringed the closed roads near the arena, highlighting the strict security that surrounds the president\u2019s visit, while a carnival mood embraced the waiting supporters, some of whom had been in line since before daybreak. \u201cWe\u2019re here to support our president starting his campaign for four more years, but really everything he\u2019s done in the last two years has delivered the message already,\u201d said Jake Morton, a car mechanic from Tampa, Florida, who drove to the rally with his wife. Here we go again. Donald Trump launched his 2016 presidential campaign on 16 June 2015, in front of a small crowd in Trump Tower. Four years (and two days) on, he\u2019s giving his 2020 pitch to a gathering of 20,000 people at Orlando\u2019s Amway Center. Trump is bidding for a second term at a time when the economy is doing well and unemployment is at its lowest rate for half a century. But he heads into his re-election campaign as a historically unpopular president. Just 42.5% of Americans approve of Trump\u2019s performance, while 53.1% disapprove. At the same time polling \u2013 including internal polling, conducted by the Trump campaign \u2013 shows the president lagging way behind the leading Democratic 2020 candidates. Last week a Quinnipiac survey found Trump losing to Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Cory Booker nationally. So what has Trump got planned? In 2015, Trump stunned most observers by using his announcement to claim Mexico was sending rapists, drug dealers, and other non-specific criminals to the US. Few gave him a chance, but the pugnacity, and repeated use of racist overtone, ultimately worked. It\u2019s 2019. Trump is four years older, and \u2013 theoretically \u2013 four years wiser, than when he launched his 2016 campaign. Will that make for a calmer event? We\u2019ll find out when he takes the stage, at about 8pm ET."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
