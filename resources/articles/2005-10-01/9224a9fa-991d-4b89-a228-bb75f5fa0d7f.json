Belatedly responding to our inquiries about his rumoured appearance on the ITV show, the renowned Rangers fan declares: \"I'd rather wash the dishes at Celtic.\" But Randall reveals that he was sounded out about another show which would dump six British \"guinea pigs\" in a remote French village with no access to English media. \"When I told the production company that I had A-level French, they immediately lost interest in me,\" he says. \u00b7 It doesn't look like too many Monument Securities staff have become City millionaires after Insinger de Beaufort finally snapped up the broker last week. Reports of a \u00a325m sale price are greatly exaggerated - we hear it went for under \u00a310m. The only Monument employee likely to have made any money from the deal is a one-time petrol pump attendant, Martin Burton, its chief executive. \u00b7 Having scored a knighthood for resurrecting British Airways' fortunes, it seems Rod Eddington has little reason to hang around the UK now his time at the airline is up. The Australian is winging his way home to head up JP Morgan's Aussie and Kiwi operations in the new year. But the non-executive chairman's role shouldn't be too taxing for the 55-year-old - Sir Rod will be required to spend only a couple of days a week swanning between Sydney and Melbourne as the \"senior public face\" of the investment bank. \u00b7 Usually, one launch shindig is enough. Not so for online pollster YouGov. It is celebrating its Brand Index with five nights of soirees. While there will be the obligatory champagne and canap\u00e9s, the joint boss, Stephan Shakespeare, assures us the events are more about demonstrating the product to would-be customers. What YouGov will be splurging on room hire, it will save on decorations - its corporate colours are the same as the venue's, the Audi Forum."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
