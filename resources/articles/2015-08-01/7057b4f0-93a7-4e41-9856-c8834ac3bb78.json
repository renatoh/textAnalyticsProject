Richard Kilty, the reigning world and European indoor 60m champion, also admitted that he thought those who took performance-enhancing drugs were still ahead of the testers and predicted that, of the eight athletes who will line up for the 100m final next Sunday, as many as five could be former doping cheats. Kilty, who will compete in the 100m and 4x100m relay in Beijing, was speaking after the Sunday Times published claims that the International Association of Athletics Federations had suppressed a report by the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany which suggested that between 29 and 34% of the 1,800 athletes at the 2011 World Athletics Championships in Daegu, South Korea, had violated anti-doping rules in the 12 months before the event. Kilty said: \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking. I\u2019ve been in the sport since I was 10 and you\u2019re very naive as a kid growing up and you just believe these people are all super-talented and work super-hard and get results from that. Now as you get older you start to hear and see things and it\u2019s very heartbreaking knowing that athletes who I\u2019ve potentially looked up to as a kid could have potentially been on drugs.\u201d All three American sprinters in the men\u2019s 100m \u2013 Justin Gatlin, Mike Rodgers and Tyson Gay \u2013 have returned from doping bans, as has the Jamaican Asafa Powell and Nigerian-born Femi Ogunode, who competes for Qatar. All are contenders for medals in Beijing. Kilty said he struggled with the idea that he could be competing against people who were possibly on drugs or who had taken them in the past. \u201cIt is very, very annoying. One: that you have to go out there and they have an unfair advantage over you. And two: they are taking all the publicity for all the wrong reasons. Of eight potential finalists, if you look on paper, at least five have failed tests \u2013 which is not great.\u201d Kilty also doubted that much had changed in his sport since the University of T\u00fcbingen research was conducted. \u201cI would like to believe so but the cheats are always going to be one step ahead of the testers like the criminals will be ahead of the police,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be something new. It\u2019s very sad. It\u2019s something I try not to think about too much because it could start to get me down. But it\u2019s always going to be at the back of your mind and you do think about it occasionally.\u201d On Sunday the IAAF insisted that the University of T\u00fcbingen research was a survey that was never intended for publication. In a statement it said: \u201cThis is not a new story, having first been raised on German TV in 2013, and those concerns were addressed by the IAAF at the time. The study in question was a social science-based survey conducted by Wada [the World Anti-Doping Agency] and a team of researchers at the athletes\u2019 village in Daegu. The purpose of the study was to assess the reliability of potential new methods of evaluating the prevalence of doping in sport using more of a social science approach [randomised-response survey]. \u201cNo publication was ever evoked,\u201d it added. \u201cIn fact, the survey was only ever repeated once, with a revised methodology, at the Pan Arab Games where mainly athletes were interviewed. The IAAF was therefore surprised when it was informed in early 2013 that an article had already been submitted by the research team for publication in a scientific journal without the IAAF\u2019s knowledge. The IAAF understands that the article was rejected for publication.\u201d On Sunday night a German documentary, Doping \u2013 Top Secret, quoted an anonymous anti-doping official who used to work for the IAAF saying that the federation faced problems when it tried to pursue athletes suspected of taking banned substances. The source told the programme that before the 2011 championships, doping control officers carried out numerous tests in the athletes\u2019 village which indicated possible cases of doping. The source said the officers were \u201cinitially quite shocked\u201d at the prevalence of abnormal test results. But while the IAAF had done \u201ceverything it could\u201d to track down dopers, when the doping control officers tried to carry out further unannounced tests on the athletes in their home countries, they were often hindered by \u201clogical and legal problems\u201d. In addition, the source alleged, money was rarely made available for further testing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
