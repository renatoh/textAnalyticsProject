The flashpoint occurred as Newcastle\u2019s players celebrated Papiss Cisse\u2019s goal during Wednesday night\u2019s 1-1 draw at Selhurst Park in front of the Holmesdale End. Coloccini was the unfortunate victim but Carver, the Newcastle manager, was relieved that the damage was not worse. \u201cI have seen it and it misses Colo\u2019s eye by an inch \u2013 another inch and it could blind him,\u201d Carver said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have that in this game. I hope the authorities deal with it and I\u2019m sure they will because it will be on TV every other minute and rightly so. Let\u2019s find out who it was and sort it out. \u201cIt just can\u2019t happen, can it? It has got to be taken out of the game. What is disappointing from Palace\u2019s point of view is that they have an unbelievable crowd here, an unbelievable atmosphere \u2013 it is a fanatical group of supporters in that corner. But it takes one idiot to throw a coin.\u201d Alan Pardew, the Palace manager, said: \u201cI saw the referee come over to the linesman and hand him something. It would be a shame if that was an incident \u2013 a random fan acting poorly [and,] if that is the case, that is unusual for this club because we have a great record of behaviour. I am sure we will look into it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
