Zen-Ruffinen, who in the past few days has launched a stinging attack on some Fifa officials, including the president Sepp Blatter, was supposed to arrive in Miami today for the Concacaf congress. However, he told a Swiss newspaper yesterday: \"I was 'advised' to stay at home. I received physical threats. If I had gone today I would have made sure I was well protected, with bodyguards.\" On Thursday Zen-Ruffinen launched a legal action against Concacaf's president, Jack Warner, and its general secretary, Chuck Blazer, for defamation of character after they alleged that he had been trying to recruit support for Issa Hayatou, the sole challenger to Blatter's presidency. In two separate interviews this week, Zen-Ruffinen has been critical of the way Fifa is run. He has also claimed that he was about to reveal exact details of the organisation's finances after the collapse of Fifa's marketing partner, ISL, to an independent audit committee that had been set up to investigate the affair. The audit committee was suspended by Blatter, sparking fury among some Fifa officials, who claimed that he was acting outside the organisation's statutes. When asked why he had broken his silence Zen-Ruffinen said: \"Because I had to, to protect myself. I could not close my eyes on things whose existence I suspected.\" Meanwhile, Blatter insisted yesterday that he did not suspend the committee because he wanted to prevent Zen-Ruffinen or any other official from revealing delicate information. In a statement Blatter said that he had taken the action because there had been a breach of confidentiality, as he had explained in a letter to the committee's chairman David Will. The committee is set to reconvene as early as next week. Uefa yesterday reduced a suspension imposed on Roma's Francesco Totti after a brawl in last month's Champions League match against Galatasaray from three matches to two. Francisco Lima's ban was also reduced on appeal, from three games to one. In addition Roma will not now face a one-match ban at their Olympic Stadium but will instead have to pay a \u00a3210,000 fine. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
