Mr Duncan Smith's social justice policy review group has concluded that equality of opportunity is hugely dependent on the stability of family structures. One expert on the panel said the cost of family breakdown was up to \u00a316bn a year. \"Britain is a world leader in terms of family breakdown. We have the highest level of divorce and lone parenting in Europe and the fourth highest level of births outside marriage in Europe, after Sweden, Denmark and France,\" said the review group's chairman on family breakdown, Samantha Callan. Neither Dr Callan, an independent rather than a party figure, nor Mr Duncan Smith was keen to draw premature conclusions from the findings. They are intended as a preliminary step towards a report that will help Mr Cameron formulate social policy before the general election. Both avoided saying that moves to encourage \"traditional marriage, back to a 1950s golden age\" would be their automatic recommendation. They also stressed a reluctance to \"stigmatise\" lone parents, many of whom achieved success in difficult circumstances, they stressed. But their statistics presented a bleak picture of the risks run by couples having children outside marriage, especially for young, unskilled single women for whom having a baby is sometimes the limits of their emotional horizon. The policy group reported that nearly one in two children in the UK are now born to unmarried parents, compared with one in eight in 1980. Some 2.3 million children (26%) currently live in lone parent households, compared with 15% in 1986. \"Does this matter? It matters because nearly one in two unmarried parents will have split before their child's fifth birthday and three-quarters of all family breakdown affecting children under five involves unmarried parents,\" said the report. Children living in broken families are \"more likely to under-perform at school, to turn to crime, to live in poverty and to be at risk of abuse\", Dr Callan told reporters at the London HQ of Mr Duncan Smith's thinktank, the Commission for Social Justice. Though women and children suffer most through poverty and violence, separated men are also more prone to depression and suicide. The report concludes: \"Marriage is not some kind of magic bullet for family stability, as divorce rates show, but statistically it is more likely that children born into a married couple family will grow up with both biological parents and avoid the negative experience of disruption.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
