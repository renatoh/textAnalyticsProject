Working as a Sky pundit at Warrington yesterday - the role he insists was the only one he had in mind when he set off from Australia last Tuesday - the former St Helens and Hull coach said for the first time that he had been offered the City Reds job. \"Salford have indicated they would like me to take the job but I will have discussions with them,\" he said. \"Experience teaches me not to jump straight into it.\" But it will be a major surprise if he is not in charge of Salford when they face St Helens at Knowsley Road on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
