By breakfast time, our train had arrived in Davos, long before the hordes of air travellers. And when we stepped on to our first chairlift, most of them were still waiting for their coach transfer to the resort. Many skiers and boarders will be familiar with the overnight Snow Trains and the Eurostar service which run direct to the French Alps. These enable you to ski both on the day of arrival and your day of departure, so you get eight days' skiing instead of the usual six, but without the need for any extra accommodation. Unfortunately, they only run as far as the Espace Killy, Three Valleys and Paridiski areas. But what few people realise is that resorts in Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Andorra, and other parts of France, are all accessible from the UK simply by taking a Eurostar to Paris and then switching to ordinary national trains. Like many Swiss and Austrian resorts, Davos has a railway station in the resort itself. To get there, you catch the 17.42 Eurostar on Friday from London Waterloo to Paris, and change on to an overnight train. After one more change the next morning at Landquart in Switzerland, you arrive in the resort at 08.55. You can then leave your luggage at your hotel or chalet, have breakfast, and hit the slopes on the quietest day of the week - ideal for warming up nervous ski legs. Or, if you need to hire or buy ski or snowboard gear first, it's a good time to do it because you get an unhurried service and more choice of gear. On your final day, you enjoy another day's skiing before taking the 20.02 train out of Davos on Saturday evening, changing in Landquart and Paris to arrive back in London at 09.51 on Sunday morning. I was keen to travel by train not just because of the extra two days' skiing, but for ecological reasons. Flying to a European ski resort is estimated to have 10 times greater impact on global warming than travelling by train. Our plan was to cram as much skiing, snowboarding and partying as possible into the week's holiday, so a decent night's sleep on either end of the holiday would help. We had chosen the cheapest option, a six-berth couchette, containing simple padded bunk beds, with shared washing facilities in the toilet at the end of the corridor. The bunks, covered in black plastic faux-leather with a pillow, sheet sleeping bag and a blanket provided, looked functional rather than inviting. But sleep was not a priority just yet. The train corridors were lined with people chatting. We soon found ourselves sharing a bottle of red with a group of French skiers from the next compartment. Sometime after midnight we retired to our couchettes, where the movement of the train was helpfully soporific. In fact, the only thing keeping us awake was the banter flying between the bunks. Not all destinations have convenient overnight train services, but many can still be reached during the day. And overnight services to more distant Austrian destinations don't get you there early enough to make the most of the day's skiing. However, you can catch the specially chartered overnight train for skiers, the Bergland Express, which goes directly from Brussels and reaches many of the faraway Austrian resorts, such as Kitzb\u00fchel, Soll, and Mayrhofen by mid-morning. If you are booking a package holiday through a tour operator, you can still go by train. Crystal, Thomson, Inghams and Neilson all offer accommodation-only packages, leaving you around \u00a3130 to spend on the train fare. The earlier you book, the cheaper the fares: the Eurostar portion of the journey can be booked up to 90 days in advance, and the onward part up to 60 days in advance. Ordinary trains have daily services, and the tickets allow a break in the journey of 24 hours, so you can visit a European city or town en route. Unlike the Snow Trains, taking ordinary trains from Paris requires a change of station. Though the Paris metro is simple and quick, there are fair distances to be walked, with stairs rather than escalators the norm. If you have heavy luggage, book a cab to meet you at Paris Nord. G7 Taxis in Paris (0033 1 4739 4739) has English-speaking staff and can book up to 15 days in advance. A larger vehicle, called a \"monospace\", can carry skis or snowboards at the driver's discretion. The journey costs \u20ac20 or less, depending on the station. Alternatively, book an earlier Eurostar, and dine in Paris before you board the overnight train. But if, like me, you sleep soundly after a good bottle of rouge and a four-course meal, remember to set your alarm clock or you may miss the scenery.
