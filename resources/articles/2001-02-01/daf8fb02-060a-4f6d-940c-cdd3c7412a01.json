Welsh first minister Rhodri Morgan is to launch the reforms, which include controversial proposals to retain community health councils, the local patient watchdog bodies that are to be abolished in England on the grounds that they are outdated. Mr Morgan says in the introduction to the plan that it will continue the assembly's work on improving health in Wales and break \"new ground in the necessary work of transforming our nation\". Assembly health minister Jane Hutt said: \"We need to ensure that the national assembly itself provides a new sense of leadership, direction and oversight. \"The plan will involve a new assertion of the national assembly's direct democratic control of its health responsibilties.\" The plan, Improving health in Wales, heralds the abolition of the principality's five health authorities in a bid to cut management costs and strip away bureaucracy. The health authorities commissioning role will taken on by GP-led, local health groups - the Welsh equivalent of English primary care groups. A health and well-being partnership council is to be created, chaired by Ms Hutt, with a brief to improve health services. There will be a shake-up of the public health function, while the role of local government in health services will be \"enhanced\" through the creation of partnership boards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
