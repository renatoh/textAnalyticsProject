It is always possible that no one will want to offer any work, but this weekend cricket's most prominent freelancer and first tax exile must be sitting pretty somewhere in Dubai. Andrew Flintoff knows that once he can walk again, he will stroll right back into the England one-day side, always assuming that there is not a better offer on the table to play elsewhere. England have been so insipid in the past fortnight that Flintoff would be welcomed back with open arms if only because his presence in the dressing room appears to promote confidence. Just remember how dire England were throughout the Headingley Test in Flintoff's absence. Their performances in six one-day internationals have been no better, the sole consolation for the two Andrews, Strauss and Flower, being that the team's ineptitude does not seem to matter so much. This summer will still be remembered for England's Ashes victory rather than their NatWest humiliation. Even so it has been a degenerating mess. Australia have been invigorated by this tournament, seizing it as a chance to regain some pride after the Ashes defeat and to prepare for the Champions Trophy, which begins in South Africa on Tuesday. The England players are either exhausted (Paul Collingwood, James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Matt Prior) or incompetent (the rest with the honourable exception of Strauss). There has been a major turnover in personnel since that joyous afternoon at The Oval when there did not appear to be a cloud in the sky for England's cricketers. The team that lost to Australia on Thursday night at Trent Bridge contained just four players who were celebrating on that Sunday at the end of August. The one-day specialists have had their chance but failed to deliver. Adil Rashid, Eoin Morgan and Luke Wright \u2013 who has been passed fit for the Champions Trophy \u2013 have flickered and that's about it. There is one more opportunity to do something today in the final match of an interminable series at Chester-le-Street. Then this group of players are South Africa-bound. England are not entitled to change their squad for the Champions Trophy because of bad form. Only injuries will do and in the wake of Bloodgate it is probably wise that they should be proper injuries. It may be that the turnover has been too great. We have been reminded that 50-over cricket requires as many skills that are relevant to Test cricket as to Twenty20. There is a need to build an innings and to survive against attacking bowlers like Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson. We are pining for Jonathan Trott and \u2013 this is a fine indication of how reputations can blossom when a player is out of the team \u2013 Ian Bell. Kevin Pietersen would be handy as well. Likewise bowlers, whose primary goal is to take wickets rather than contain, are required (the best can do both, of course). Most disappointing of all is the fact that no one has had the gumption to seize their opportunity to play a significant innings or deliver the telling spell. At least if England continue to play hopelessly the torment will not last much longer. If they lose their three group games in the Champions Trophy \u2013 against Sri Lanka, South Africa and New Zealand \u2013 they will be home within a week. This is one of the virtues of a rejigged tournament, which shows signs that the ICC are beginning to see sense. It will all be over in a fortnight. It will be played in two venues \u2013 at the Wanderers and Centurion, which are just 45 minutes apart. There is not the usual excess of fixtures, which are designed to fill coffers but which end up leaving punters, pundits and players disillusioned with the game. The winners will have played just five matches. It would be helpful if the England and Wales Cricket Board took note. England, yet to win a major one-day tournament, are not among the favourites to win this one. In fact they must be seventh favourites in a race of eight. West Indies, barring a late change of heart, will be represented by such players as Royston Crandon, Travis Dowlin and Chadwick Walton and several other unfamiliar names since the players' dispute with the board has yet to be resolved. But England will not have the luxury of playing against West Indies in their group. The semi-finals commence on 2 October. Expect Strauss and his team to be at leisure by then while South Africa, Sri Lanka, Australia and India scrap for a place in the final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
