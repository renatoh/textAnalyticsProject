The former prime minister is to lend his expertise and his \"global relationships\" to the California-based company, which is led by Indian-born billionaire Vinod Khosla, one of the founders of the computer firm Sun Microsystems. Khosla recently raised $1bn from investors to pump into promising technologies aimed at cutting carbon emissions. He is a proponent of ethanol fuel as an alternative to petrol, and he has come in for criticism for benefiting from US government subsidies towards food-based ethanol production. \"Solving the climate crisis is more than just a political agenda item \u2013 it's an urgent priority that requires innovation, creativity and ambition,\" said Blair, in a statement. \"I share a clear vision with Vinod, one of the earliest leaders in cleantech investment, that entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and beyond will have a tremendous impact on our environmental future.\" Blair, who hit the campaign trail for Labour in the final days of the general election, has developed a long CV since leaving Downing Street in 2007. He holds a peacekeeping role in the Middle East on behalf of the \"quartet\" \u2013 the US, the UN, Russia and the EU. In the private sector, he holds a consultancy post for the Wall Street bank JP Morgan Chase, which reportedly pays him a seven-figure salary. And he earns up to \u00a3400,000 an hour for speeches on the international lecture circuit. His appointment to Khosla Ventures was announced at a summit for the firm's investors in Sausalito, near San Francisco, yesterday where speakers were due to include Microsoft's founder Bill Gates. Under questioning, Blair declined to reveal his salary, although he told the Wall Street Journal that the job was \"not a pro bono\" role. Khosla Ventures' founder said the arrangement would allow him to \"ask Tony for advice\" on environmental policy and other topics. Khosla told the WSJ: \"Tony's going to help us in many areas that techie nerds like us in Silicon Valley don't understand.\" The 55-year-old tycoon has a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $1.1bn. He has argued that rather than simply attempting to cut energy consumption, the world should look for technological breakthroughs to find \"clean\" alternatives to oil, coal, cement and steel. Khosla Ventures' website says the firm embraces a direct style: \"We prefer brutal honesty to hypocritical politeness.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
