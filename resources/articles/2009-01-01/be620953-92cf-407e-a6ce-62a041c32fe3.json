Mandelson also indicated that the UK government was considering further measures to help the British car industry. Paul Everitt, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, who is due, with industry leaders, to meet Mandelson towards the end of this month, said Britain \"is not moving as quickly\" as other EU countries in supporting carmakers. The SMMT wants a \"direct route to sustain demand\" via access to the government's bank liquidity scheme at attractive rates for carmakers' finance arms and further action to promote bank lending to big firms as well as incentives for companies to retain staff and invest in R&amp;D. France, Germany, Italy and others have adopted measures to boost demand for new cars, including easier credit and incentives to buy eco-friendly models. This has raised fears among liberal free-marketeers such as Mandelsonthat EU competition and single-market rules could still be broken even though they have been relaxed in the worst recession for 50 years. \"I would emphasise the importance of maintaining an EU-wide level playing field,\" Mandelson told reporters. G\u00fcnter Verheugen, the EU industry commissioner, said there would be \"no free ride\". EU industry ministers agreed to co-ordinate their aid programmes and avoid beggar-thy-neighbour measures for an industry that saw sales decline by almost 8% last year and could see them slump by 10-20% in 2009, with a threat to hundreds of thousands of jobs. They also urged the industry to cut over-capacity estimated at 20% and invest in green technologies. France's Europe minister, Bruno Le Maire, said in an interview that dumping would be disastrous for employment. He added that, within five years, only eight to 10 global car manufacturers would be left. \"They should be principally European,\" he said. Mandelson and others demanded that European manufacturers be allowed equal access to US bail-out schemes. Mandelson called for an early dialogue with Barack Obama's team. Ministers also urged the European Investment Bank, the EU's in-house lender, to accelerate aid for the car industry on a non-discriminatory basis. Matthias Kollatz-Ahnen, the EIB vice-president, told reporters the bank had already approved \u20ac600mDa of soft loans for projects under its \"green transport facility\" and was due to approve a further \u20ac3.2bn in March. He indicated that the EIB could make more lending available this year on top of the near \u20ac10bn earmarked so far."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
