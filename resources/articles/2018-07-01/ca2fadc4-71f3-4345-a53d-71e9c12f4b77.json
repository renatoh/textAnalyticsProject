Or, as she is perhaps more widely known, the woman who designed the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s wedding dress. This was only her second couture show, though in her 16-month tenure at the French fashion house she has already proven to be a lot of firsts: the first of Givenchy\u2019s artistic directors to dare to bring couture back after the house dismantled it in 2012. And the first woman appointed to head the storied house that Hubert de Givenchy built. But, as she said backstage, she was also the first artistic director to meet the founder and designer who died three months ago: \u201cand so having met him and spoken to him and the fact that he passed only three months ago, I realised his legacy needed to be celebrated\u201d. And so, in what also became a day of posthumous celebrations at Paris\u2019s couture \u2013 first at Sonia Rykiel whose collection was a stylistic homage to the work of Rykiel who died in 2016, and then here \u2013 Waight Keller also became the first person at Givenchy to address his legacy in full. Both by rifling through his archive, and in a collection which concentrated on the pas de deux between the designer and his muse, Audrey Hepburn, and a relationship upon which the entire Hollywood fashion industry was arguably built. How? Most obviously via an unambiguous finale which finished with both a Holly Golightly-esque sleeveless black dress and Hepburn\u2019s rendition of Moon River playing overhead. Set in the grand gardens behind the Archives Nationales, and based around a bronze metallic catwalk which reflected both the chestnut trees and partially clouded sky, the show was otherwise an unabashed celebration of 50s and 60s glamour. This was key, she said: \u201cwe all know the big stars of couture but Hubert was the other star of the 50s and 60s that came out\u201d. Givenchy has a history of connecting women to shape, and the collection focused on the singular aesthetic of Hollywood glamour, realised in complementary ways. Either via sharp, clean tailoring or through grand, floor-sweeping gowns. Both were predominantly monochrome with the odd flash of emerald green, icy pastels or dark mineral palette. There wasn\u2019t a whiff of duchess Meghan\u2019s ultra-simple dress \u2013 and no questions asked \u2013 although most of the drama did centre around the shoulders, in true Givenchy style. Sturdy capelets dominated the first half, appearing in full-length silken versions or more cropped and structured shapes with several models wearing them \u2018robe\u2019 style, to leave them hands free. Elsewhere, shoulders rose up from tulip-shaped dresses which sat off-shoulder, or were visible above coat-like dresses, and came with another Givenchy/Hepburn tic \u2013 the bow. Waight Keller was keen to look to the past, and to the symbiosis between Givenchy and Hepburn, but recast it in her vernacular \u201cso as not to let her overwhelm it\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t re-watch anything, I just wanted to absorb what I knew\u201d. She trawled through his archives and came across \u201ccapes, the peekaboo necklines, and the architecture. There were things I didn\u2019t know he did.\u201d Most eyebrow raising was the use of metal, which was beaten into shape to form warrior-like chokers, and crescent-shaped hair pieces, and which was a central if underdocumented part of the Givenchy archive. Perhaps the greatest reminder of past and present came when a drone flying overhead to film the show narrowly missed a gull. If the collection felt almost architectural, Waight Keller was the first to admit it: \u201cit is very difficult to get the shape and line with feathers.\u201d The challenge, she said, was to create \u201ca floorless feeling \u2013 to create something that floats\u201d but using modern materials not available to Hubert, she said, alluding to rich silks, French velvet, soft leathers, Japanese bonding techniques and sequins designed to move like liquid. \u201cIt made everything feel much more modern.\u201d Even the Hepburn-esque black dress came updated, with a crossed back and monastic black hood. With sales split 50-50 between men\u2019s and women\u2019s, she also included menswear in her show, although the structured variations on black tie were far from distracting. That one male model carried a dog chain suggests the Givenchy couture man is more of a plus one. Still there is a lot riding on Waight Keller\u2019s work. The brand has revenues near enough to \u20ac600m (\u00a3530m). When she joined, Bernard Arnault believed she would increase revenue further still \u2013 the aim, it\u2019s said, is to reach the Dior \u201cbillion dollar club\u201d as the press sometimes calls it. Prior to her role at Givenchy, the designer had worked her way up fashion\u2019s hierarchy, working on menswear at Ralph Lauren, and then at Gucci, Pringle of Scotland and most recently, Chloe. Predictions that she would bring the soft-focus breeziness of Chloe \u2013 where she was creative director for six years \u2013 to Givenchy and perhaps bring back the brand\u2019s \u201cHepburn history\u201d have been heard in the wings; reductively or not, both women are routinely described as gamine. The show notes mentioned Hubert de Givenchy\u2019s \u201cmythical oeuvre\u201d, and the relationship between \u201cnoble fabrics\u201d and \u201can untouched natural beauty\u201d. In short, the past of Givenchy reimagined for the present for the first time in the label\u2019s history."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
