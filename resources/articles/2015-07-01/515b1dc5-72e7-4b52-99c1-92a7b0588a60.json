The club are in advanced negotiations with the PSV Eindhoven midfielder, 24, and remain hopeful he will shortly complete a transfer believed to be in the region of \u00a312m. \u201cWe\u2019re close to making our first signings,\u201d said McClaren, who hopes to welcome up to five new recruits, the majority in the \u00a310m-plus price bracket, by the end of August. \u201cBelieve me, there is a massive willingness from the club to spend. I\u2019ve come in and looked at the plan, looked at the calibre of players we\u2019re targeting and said \u2018wow\u2019.\u201d It was the first time the former England coach had spoken to the majority of the north-east media since the farcical press conference which marked his arrival at St James\u2019 Park last month when, at the insistence of the club, McClaren spoke to only one national newspaper, the Daily Mirror, which has been discussing a so-called \u201cpreferred media partnership\u201d arrangement with Newcastle. Whatever the outcome of those negotiations, McClaren has subsequently made it clear to Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s owner, and Lee Charnley, the managing director, that excluding the wider media access to the club would be a retrograde step. Acutely aware the relationship between Newcastle and many of their supporters has suffered several severe fractures in recent seasons, the 54-year-old feels open communication with journalists can help begin the process of reconnecting those supporters with the team. Accordingly, he invited north-east-based reporters to lunch at the training ground on Thursday to shed some light on Ashley\u2019s latest, newly ambitious, blueprint. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked a lot about the next three transfer windows being huge, massive, for us,\u201d McClaren said. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure we get the right players. If we do, then, in a year\u2019s time \u2013 after the third window \u2013 we should have a damn good team and the squad should be on a different level to where we are now. That\u2019s purely because we\u2019re looking at players above a certain [price] bracket. \u201cWe\u2019ve put our objectives on the line and Mike Ashley has said: \u2018Go on, fulfil it\u2019. We\u2019re looking for a calibre of player to improve what we\u2019ve got. But when you go \u00a310m-plus \u2013 to Europa League and Champions League players at top clubs \u2013 competition is high. \u201cSo, no, I\u2019m not in the least frustrated at the length of time it\u2019s taking to get the first player in. Sometimes the right ones take a little bit of extra time. And we need to get the right ones. \u201cWe have got one or two positions we need to fill desperately, so we might need to buy about four or five players this window. That would be great. I think everybody would be happy if we could do that.\u201d A big part of McClaren\u2019s remit is getting more out of what was widely perceived as an under-achieving squad last season. Significantly, discipline has already been tightened appreciably, with two players sent home for minor transgressions in recent days as he and staff strive to implement a \u201cno excuses\u201d culture. Unusually among managers \u2013 or head coaches \u2013 he has a seat on Newcastle\u2019s board. So is he more a coach or director? \u201cA bit of both,\u201d said McClaren, who has not abandoned hope of signing Charlie Austin from QPR. \u201cBut the majority of my time \u2013 90 per cent \u2013 will be spent on the training field. That\u2019s the job, improving, coaching the players, getting them organised, getting them fit and also helping with recruitment.\u201d He will be assisted by Ian Cathro, the former Valencia No2. For a man so young \u2013 he celebrates his 29th birthday on Saturday \u2013 Cathro demonstrated extraordinary poise and assurance as he put first-teamers, including Moussa Sissoko and Fabricio Coloccini, through their training ground paces on Thursday. \u201cWe want to give the players a chance to enjoy it here,\u201d said McClaren. \u201cBut we also want to give them a job to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
