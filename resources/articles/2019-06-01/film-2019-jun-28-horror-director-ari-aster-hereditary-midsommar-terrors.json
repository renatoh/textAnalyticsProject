It is highly likely to give you nightmares. The film\u2019s writer/director, Ari Aster, is currently having one of his own: battling reporters determined to discover his own demons. \u201cI\u2019m cripplingly neurotic when it comes to these interviews,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, these are just total minefields.\u201d Hereditary, his breakout debut from last year about a miserable family, featured two beheadings and a sobbing Toni Collette literally climbing the walls. People sensed that this soft-spoken, charmingly awkward young film-maker might have been inspired by a past he didn\u2019t want to share. After much grilling, Aster has learned to reveal small intimacies (a stutter when he was young, a solitary childhood) while palming the truly personal. Hereditary was the first horror script he wrote. Midsommar \u2013 inspired by a breakup \u2013 is the second. It is wickedly hilarious, yet clarifies the impression that Aster approaches movies like a skilful butcher, flaying his own neurosis to present audiences with quivering raw meat that could be his heart \u2013 or maybe, one fears, their own. The film opens with a college girl, Dani (Florence Pugh), losing her parents and sister to an incomprehensible tragedy. Even before this, her relationship with her longterm boyfriend, Christian (Jack Reynor), was shaky. Christian\u2019s mates \u2013 Josh (William Jackson Harper) and Mark (Will Poulter) \u2013 pester him to break up with her; instead, he invites Dani to tag along on a boys\u2019 holiday to their friend\u2019s home in H\u00e4lsingland, a flower-strewn paradise with a few fatal customs. It was Dani with whom Aster most readily identified. \u201cI\u2019ve certainly been in her position many times, where I am clinging to something that\u2019s dead because I\u2019m not done with it,\u201d he says. Aster was eager to hone Pugh and Reynor\u2019s hostile, unspoken dynamic. The actors were instructed to cook meals in character, as well as to field questions about their feelings as if he were their couples therapist. As for the anthropology, Aster spent months researching Scandinavian and Germanic myths and traditions, touring museums and ancient farms and studying plants, paintings and Viking torture techniques. Drug-induced hallucinogens, gory prosthetics and a particularly ripe herring are also thrown into the mix. Aster likes films that disturb. At four, he had his first cinematic experience, seeing Dick Tracy. When the tommy guns started blazing, he fled. \u201cMy mom had to chase me down 10 New York city blocks [while I was] just screaming my head off.\u201d A few years later, the family moved from Manhattan to Chester, in the UK, where his father opened a jazz club. Aster liked Chester, but at 10, the family relocated again, to New Mexico, upending, he says, his stability. He dealt with the culture shock by diving into film. He admired blockbuster auteurs such as Tim Burton, and rhapsodises about Batman Returns. \u201cIt\u2019s this work of bizarre Hollywood expressionism!\u201d By 11, he had watched A Clockwork Orange and Blue Velvet, and hated them both. \u201cThey felt really mean,\u201d he says. Yet, he watched them over and over to make sense of why they rattled in his brain. \u201cI developed a taste for mean-spirited storytelling,\u201d he says. He spent his youth alone, writing scripts. He couldn\u2019t bear to make something amateur. \u201cI knew I didn\u2019t have the actors or the lighting equipment,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was maybe indicative of a larger arrogance.\u201d Eventually he made it to graduate film school at the American Film Institute in Los Angeles, where his first film deliberately provoked the AFI\u2019s sensible tastes. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing I could do here?\u201d he asked himself. \u201cAnd I was like: \u2018What about a son molesting his father?\u2019 Nobody should do that. So then it became an exercise \u2013 can I make that compelling?\u201d He could. The Strange Thing About the Johnsons, a 30-minute incest melodrama about a twenty-something man who, even after his own wedding, continues to abuse his dad, is stunningly confident film-making. And if viewers listen closely, they can hear Aster\u2019s voice as a motivational speaker who warns: \u201cHorrible things happening to people is inextricably linked to people thinking horrible things might happen to them.\u201d That muffled caution might capture his career to date. Not that he has outrun his fears. Shooting Midsommar in Budapest, Aster was so paranoid about ticks that he wore green knee-socks and a netted safari hat. \u201cI\u2019m a neurotic Jew and I\u2019m afraid of Lyme disease,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was very embarrassing, but I cared more about my peace of mind than being fashionable on the set.\u201d Now, he says, he\u2019s done with horror. \u201cEverything else I\u2019ve written is in a different genre. I love musicals. I love romantic comedies. I would love to do animation.\u201d Then he leans forward to show me a sketch on his phone, of what looks like a parrot beak bursting through a bashed-in head. That horror bug is hard to kill. \u2022 Midsommar is out in the UK on 5 July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
