Well, it's wet and it's where the big showdown with Moriarty happens. But he doesn't kill Sherlock, because he gets a phone call from a lady, who turns out to be Irene Adler. Ah yes, the woman, the only one who ever meant anything to Holmes, from Conan Doyle's A Scandal in Bohemia. This story is called A Scandal in Belgravia. Stephen Moffat seems to be moving stuff from Europe to London, as well as shunting everything 120 or so years forward in time. In Sir ACD's story, a European royal house is threatened with ruin through blackmail. There are compromising photographs. Here it's our monarchy, and the pictures are on an iPhone. Same idea though. And Sherlock uses the same trick to find where the phone is \u2013 smoke, a fake fire, the alarm goes off. In a fire a person's first thought is their most treasured possession \u2013 obviously a child, if there is one. Miss Adler doesn't have one, but she does have pictures of royals doing things they shouldn't. So she looks to where the photos/iPhone are/is hidden. Gotcha. Except that Adler is a bit smarter than that. Her battle of wits with Holmes isn't over yet. Hence his uncharacteristic respect. So hang on, is this simply an updated version of the Conan Doyle story? Don't be daft, it's been Moffatised as well as modernised. He starts off parallel but then wanders off left and right, into international terrorism and CIA plots and complicated conspiracy theories. It's very complicated, I find at times. I'm totally with Martin Freeman's John Watson when he says at one point: \"What happened there?\" It doesn't really matter if \u2013 like me and Watson \u2013 you are not always sure exactly what's going on. There are nods and winks to other stories \u2013 The Greek Interpreter, The Speckled Band, or the Speckled Blonde as it has become. Presumably the thumbs that Mrs Hudson finds in the fridge were once attached to engineers. I'm sure there are dozens of references I missed, but that too doesn't matter. What does matter is that it fizzes down like a glass of New Year bubbly, full of wit and sparkle. \"Mycroft could just phone me, if he didn't have this bloody stupid power complex,\" says Watson, and we immediately cut to Battersea Power station. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are just right too, as Holmes and Watson. Their funny lop-sided relationship \u2013 a mixture of admiration and frustration in one direction, teasing to the point of bullying in the other, but genuine affection too, in both directions \u2013 is perfect. It might be modern London taxis pulling up outside 221b Baker Street instead of hansom cabs, but the dynamic of the two main characters remains faithful. Oh, and Moffat even works in a deerstalker. My one tiny moan is a grammatical one. \"Did you know there were other people after her, Mycroft,\" Sherlock asks his brother. \"Before you sent John and I in there?\" John and I?? Would the great man, one of the most brilliant minds in fiction, and a stickler for detail, really have made such a simple \u2013 yes elementary \u2013 mistake? \"This is the story of a British tabloid newspaper,\" says the on-screen message at the start of Hacks (Channel 4, Sunday). \"Obviously everything in it is made up.\" Then, for the next hour, Guy Jenkin's satirical look at you know which story chronicles recent events remarkably accurately. Not the boring bits \u2013 the most outrageous, and the most fun. It is fun. And very, very silly. Claire Foy is properly good as the pushy moral vacuum of an editor. Kayvan Novak \u2013 Fonejacker turned phone hacker \u2013 is hilarious as an investigative reporter who specialises in the art of disguise and whose resemblance to a real investigative reporter who specialises in the art of disguise is obviously purely coincidental. Likewise Alexander Armstrong as \"David Bullingdon\", the posh twat who somehow gets to run the country. (From now on we must all refer to the PM as David Bullingdon, OK? And that includes you, Mr Miliband.) But Guy Jenkin's master stroke is to give Wendy De \u2026 sorry, \"Ho Chi Mao Feast\", the position at the heart of the story she clearly merits. Her brutal attack on the protester at the hearing \u2013 during which she repeatedly and ferociously bashes his head with her high heel until the blood spatters the select committee \u2013 is a joy. All of which leaves no room for Sky's Treasure Island. We'll deal with that tomorrow, then. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 January 2011 because it named Sherlock Holmes's housekeeper as Mrs Hughes instead of Mrs Hudson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
