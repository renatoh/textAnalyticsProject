Pickering was favourite for the title after a tremendous year in which he won silver at the European Indoor Championships and only last month flew to victory at the European Cup. But Williamson made a sensational start to smash his personal best with victory in 10.10, a championship record, ahead of Pickering, who was second in 10.14, 0.01 inside his previous fastest time. Martial Mbandjock, of France, was third in 10.27. The 21-year-old Williamson, who runs for Highgate Harriers, had brought extra tension to the final by suffering a false start but he made no mistake the second time. He said: \"I have never been so nervous as I was when we came out on to the track and after the false start I thought to myself, 'Here we go.' Under pressure I do not normally drive out of the blocks. But this time I did. I remembered what my coach, Lloyd Cowan, had been drilling into me and then, when I felt Craig coming up on my outside, I just kept up the technique. I had been waiting two years for this victory.\" It was in 2005 that Pickering beat Williamson to gold at the European Junior Championships but the member of Britain's senior relay squad made no mistake this time. Pickering said: \"He deserved that. There was not very much I could do about it. I ran a PB. I did all I could.\" Williamson's victory adds to what will be a tremendous race at the world championship trials in Manchester in a fortnight when this young pair will face Marlon Devonish, who leads the British rankings this season with 10.06."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
