Rio+20 in June 2012 will take place 20 years after the groundbreaking 1992 Rio Earth summit \u2013 an event that marked a watershed in international collaboration on social and environmental issues. The British government has an international reputation for championing development aid and playing a critical role on climate change. With just a year to go before Rio+20, there is a real opportunity and need for the UK to show similar leadership for sustainable development, and for the prime minister to publicly demonstrate his commitment to ensuring a successful summit. We ask the government to demonstrate leadership towards Rio+20 by, first, pledging that the prime minister will attend. Second, it should appoint an ambassador or envoy on Rio+20 to promote Rio+20 across the government, involve the public and engage in dialogue with other countries. And, finally, it must host a high-level dialogue with leaders from around the world to forge a consensus on increasingly urgent issues, such as the green economy, the food system, and building a low-carbon future. British civil society is ready to play its own role in contributing to these endeavours. We look forward to hearing the government's plans for ambitious action on the Rio+20 agenda between now and June 2012.
