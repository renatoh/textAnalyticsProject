No, no, no,\" the former Tory home secretary Willie Whitelaw once exclaimed over some political triumph. \"Well, I can tell you, I'm gloating like hell.\" Whitelaw of course never lived to see England on the brink of beating Australia in short order in the fourth Test at Melbourne, and would probably have been appalled at the 10,000-strong Barmy Army of supporters, while recognising their patriotism and fervour. Now even those on BBC's Test Match Special, who previously tut-tutted from Antigua to Calcutta, are enjoying the sound of England fans greeting success in the Ashes, if not all of the chanting. In the coliseum of the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the travelling supporters of England's Barmy Army \u2013 named from the bitter experience of defeat in many post-colonial climes \u2013 have been tuning up with their travelling trumpeter Billy Cooper to the sound of impending victory. Yesterday Billy was incongruously playing the theme tune to Coronation Street. Presumably today it will be a more seasonal jingle: Ricky the Red-faced Captain. Yesterday, they unsportingly booed Ricky Ponting, Australia's captain and the second highest run-scorer in test match history, to the wicket, finally provoking the local crowd to drown them out with cheers for a man who is likely to become the first Australian skipper in a century to lead his team to three Ashes series defeats.The Barmies, many approaching middle age and of uncertain sleekness and sobriety, but with the wherewithal to be able to afford several weeks in Australia, were also mercilessly barracking the hapless Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnson. Test Match Special newcomer Michael Vaughan, the former England captain who won the Ashes in 2005, and is no stranger to being barracked by Australian fans, was taken by the taunting, regaling Radio 4 listeners with the opening bars of the Barmies' song about Johnson, although wisely recognising that the scatological ending was best bowdlerised. But it is Ponting the Barmies love to hate, not least because he makes it so easy for them with his temper tantrums, such as his barney on Monday with umpire Aleem Dar when a claimed catch was disallowed. \"Ricky Ponting's a broken man. Without Warne, he has no plan,\" they chant. And to a tune approximately similar to the Beatles' old hit: \"Yesterday, Ponting's troubles seemed so far away.\" Both verses go downhill from there. It is pantomime booing. The experienced barracker knows there's no fun so satisfying as that against those \u2013 like England's bodyline captain Douglas Jardine \u2013 who can't see the joke. Even he smiled though when, as he swatted a mosquito while fielding, a fan shouted: \"Hey, Jardine, leave our flies alone. They're the only friends you've got ...\" The Melbourne Age's cricket correspondent Greg Baum wrote overnight: \"Yesterday's attendance was nearly 70,000 and at least half of them were exultant Brits. Australia has been recolonised \u2026 Rarely since the First Fleet dropped anchor has Australia been so comprehensively claimed for England.\" Even the Australian team appears, most unusually, to be raising the white flag. Batsman Shane Watson put on a brave face: \"We will do everything we can to restore pride and try to draw the series but in the end the most important thing is winning that little urn and we haven't been able to do it ... The fans have come out \u2026 and we haven't really given them anything to support.\" The Australian newspaper's correspondent Malcolm Conn couldn't believe how badly the team has played: \"It was like the band was still playing as the stern continued to rise at the MCG, the Australians played shots in bright sunshine as ... the Ashes continued to sink from view.\" England fan Wayne Rushton told a reporter: \"It feels like 70% of supporters are English. We're nearly there \u2013 but it is not guaranteed yet.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
