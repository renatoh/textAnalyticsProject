Renegade fathers, angelic social workers, stabbings and broken hearts litter their debut. James Allan sings in his own accent, summoning up the localism of the Arctic Monkeys rather than the kitsch of the Proclaimers. Sonorously retro, songs like Daddys Gone or Geraldine reconnect the dots between Phil Spectors cavernous drums and Scottish totems the Jesus Mary Chain, a combination both soppy and fierce. This echoey refrain can be repetitive but Glasvegas's sense of purpose just about overcomes their telescopic vision. Kitty Empire Queen and Paul Rodgers The Cosmos Rocks (Parlophone) 13.99 The inexplicable success of the Queen musical We Will Rock You may have suggested that the public appetite for the aged pomp rockers knows no bounds, but this studio album, their first in 13 years, should test that theory. Taking over vocal duties from Freddie Mercury, former Free frontman Paul Rodgers is an unworthy successor, his earnest bellowing as lacking in character as Mercurys wailing was heaving with it. Even setting Rodgers aside, the trad power balladry and lamentable lyrical platitudes leave The Cosmos Rocks floundering in irrelevance. Hugh Montgomery Daniel Powter Under the Radar (Warners) 12.99 Bad Day is officially the UKs most played song of the last five years, yet the man responsible, Daniel Powter, has managed to reap the rewards while remaining relatively unknown. Things aren't set to change with his third album; Powter continues to pump out anonymous soft-rock ballads with the lovelorn croak of James Blunt and high-pitched tremulous note segues of fellow Canadian Celine Dion. The one-man-and-his-piano effect is bolstered by strings, guitars and plentiful backing vocals, and despite no stand-out hit there are enough simply crafted yet insistent songs here to wallpaper the nation for another year. Katie Toms Katy Perry One of the Boys (Virgin) 10.99 In spite of the overpowering whiff of shock marketing about her the gospel-singing daughter of strict Protestant pastors who fixates on lesbian thrills and her boyfriend's gay affectations there's more than gimmickry to Katy Perry, holder of the UK number one spot for the past five weeks with I Kissed a Girl. Musically, her debut album yields few surprises, adhering to a bubblegum rock formula that signals spunky attitude but induces yawns. What justifies the attention is her creative, often humorous takes on relationships, with allusions to suicide, self-harm and Vegas weddings. Killian Fox Mariza Terra (EMI) 12.99 World divas come no classier than Mariza, whose charismatic presence and stunning voice have turned her and fado, Portugals mournful balladeering, into an international force. Her first studio album in three years finds the mixture of sorrow, dignity and poeticism that graced her earlier records. Producer Javier Limn has added a touch of nouveau flamenco, with slinky guitar lines and jazzy touches on tracks like Beijo de Saudade, a delightful duet with Tito Paris. Yet when Terra departs from fado convention (noble longing in night-time Lisbon), it can drift into Euro MOR. Still classy then, but oddly compromised Neil Spencer E.S.T. Leucocyte (ACT) 13.99 E.S.T. didn't intend this as their swansong, but when Esbjrn Svensson, pianist and moving spirit, died in a diving accident last June, that's what it turned out to be. The trios method of recording to begin playing with no preconceived plan except to rely on their almost telepathic mutual understanding means that there can never be another E.S.T. This final album is a curiously subdued affair, full of fleetingly beautiful moments but fewer of those eruptions of intense energy that characterise their earlier work, but an important release, for sadly obvious reasons. Ironically, the longest track is entitled Ad Mortem. Dave Gelly"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
