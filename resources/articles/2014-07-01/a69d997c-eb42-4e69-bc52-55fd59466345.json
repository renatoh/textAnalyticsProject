The Uruguayan striker joined Barcelona for \u00a375m this month despite biting Italy\u2019s Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup and receiving a four-month ban from Fifa. Henry, who saw Liverpool lose 1-0 to Roma at Fenway Park stadium in Boston in a pre-season friendly, is confident they made the correct decision to allow him to leave. \u201cIt was time for Luis and time for the club to make a break,\u201d he said. \u201cHe brought so much to the club but we brought a lot to Luis. I thought we needed more depth; last year we needed more depth, and we\u2019re playing a lot more games this year with the Champions League. I think you will still see a very explosive Liverpool offense.\u201d Liverpool have already begun the process of trying to replace Su\u00e1rez by signing Rickie Lambert from Southampton and French striker Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my from QPR."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
