But after watching the Sheilaroos shin one into the net before squandering 317 glorious chances and eventually stumbling through on penalties, the Fiver has no problem admitting it's sorrier than Harry Kewell's two ponytails and a feeble 12-yard Mark Viduka shank combined. For despite the moon-faced pie-guzzler's best attempts to ruin his country's chances of qualification, Middlesbrough team-mate Mark Schwarzer spared his blushes by securing a Germany 2006 berth for the Aussies with two brilliant penalty saves. Oh yes, the Fiver's sorry all right. Sorry that a once-proud nation's cricketers (surrendered the Ashes) and rugby players (lost seven in a row) are now so abysmal that sports fans down under have been reduced to crowing about merely earning the right to breathe the same German air as renowned global football heavyweights as Togo, Angola, Ivory Coast and England. \"I'm honoured. I've been in the previous teams, the last two campaigns that failed,\" said a relieved Viduka, looking on hungrily as the Fiver guzzled down a large portion of humble pie. \"I have watched as a spectator and you always think you would love to be part of it. I believe that we won't just mix it with the other teams, but compete as well.\" All of which misguided optimism from the big-boned striker proves that barstaff in London pubs aren't the only Aussies in the habit of getting everything wrong. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We were too much like ladies. High heels and soccer boots ... we tiptoed around on high heels\" - Norway coach Age Hareide might get a cameo in Little Britain if his team take another beating from the Czech Republic in tonight's World Cup play-off second leg. ********************* SPIT AND SHINE As anyone who's seen Tabloid Wayne demonstrate his extensive four-word vocabulary - f***, off, f*****g and c*** - within halitosis-sniffing distance of the referee knows, you can get away with almost anything on a football pitch. But when El Hadji Diouf spat at an 11-year-old Middlesbrough fan last November, he quickly attracted an \"'Ello? 'Ello? 'Ello? What's all this then?\" from the long arm of the law. And with good reason. For having been booed off, Diouf took a mouthful of drink and launched it - with hitherto unseen accuracy - in the direction of the stands. \"I was sat behind the Bolton subs, Diouf just turned round and spat between the glass of the dug-out,\" sobbed 11-year-old Boro supporter James Shield at the time. \"It was orange juice or Lucozade. It just flew through the gap and hit me.\" Today, justice was served - well, sort of - at Teesside magistrates court, as Diouf was fined \u00a3500 and ordered to pay costs after pleading guilty to disorderly behaviour. \"He has admitted to discharging liquid from his mouth, but without the intention to spit at any individual directly,\" insisted a crown prosecution service official. Her reasoning? Apparently Diouf didn't realise the \"perspex panel which separates the bench from fans had holes in it\". And that wasn't the only good result for the Serial Spitter, who was accused of gobbing on West Ham fans during a pre-match warm-up in November 2002, and was fined \u00a35,000 after pleading guilty to spitting on a Celtic supporter in 2003. For Diouf, who earns \u00a340,000-a-week, was also able to claim legal aid after a district judge ruled that the Bolton striker stood the risk of being banned from football grounds, thus depriving him of his livelihood. Final score: Diouf 2, Justice 0. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Franck Ribery's masterclass against the England U21s last night was watched by scouts from Arsenal, the MU White Sox, Man City and Spurs. Talk of Disco Patrick Kluivert returning to Ajax has been rubbished by his agent - and celebrated by the Ajax fans. And speaking of Ajax, Mick McCarthy's desperate search for a striker has led him to Yannis Anastasiou's door. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Michael Ballack clearly likes his name in the headlines, telling a press conference today he won't make a decision on his future until January. It'll come as no surprise to MU White Sox fans that Besiktas coach Jean Tigana is ready to ship out Kleberson. \"I will not have a place for the lazy players,\" he fumed, his gaze fixed firmly on the Brazilian. The Bosnian Cup quarter-final between Zeljeznicar and Sarajevo had to be abandoned after Sarajevo players attacked the referee. Dusan Pekija had to be treated by paramedics, while Sarajevo player Samir Saric was knocked out as the official tried to defend himself. And the inaugural Barclay's Premiership Global Fans Report 2005, published today, claims that Eric Cantona is the all-time favourite Premiership player, the Special One the all-time favourite Premiership manager, and that one in 10 supporters are influenced by footballers when naming their children. * * * * * * * * * * FIVER LETTERS \"See you in Germany you smug, arrogant, xenophobic, holier-than-thou, miserable Pommy b*stards\" - Fraser Knock (and many others). \"As an Englishman, I am really pleased that the Aussies have qualified.
