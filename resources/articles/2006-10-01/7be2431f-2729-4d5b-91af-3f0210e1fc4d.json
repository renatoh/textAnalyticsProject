It is more often than you might have expected. And it is more often than bookmakers sometimes acknowledge. In every betting market, there are certain odds that are sometimes wrong and certain odds that are never wrong. In half-time betting markets, the odds that are sometimes wrong are those about the draw in matches where one team is a very strong favourite to be winning at full-time. It happens not only in the Premiership, but also in other divisions, and even in other countries. For fairly obvious reasons, scores are more likely to be level after 45 minutes than 90 minutes. In the Premiership and Football League during the last nine completed seasons - 1996-97 to 2005-06 - 43% of games were all-square at the interval. The bookmakers understand this perfectly well. So, for a typical Premiership or Football League fixture they will quote the half-time draw at around 11-10, which represents good value to them and bad value to us. Generally speaking, the greater the difference in ability between two teams the less likely a half-time draw becomes. But the prospects of a half-time stalemate do not diminish quite as rapidly as bookmakers sometimes imagine. During Sir Alex Ferguson's most successful seasons - the last 14 and a bit - Manchester United have been level at half-time in 38.5% of their Premiership games. During the Ars\u00e8ne Wenger era -the last 10 and a bit - Arsenal have also been level at half-time in 38.5% of their Premiership games. And over the course of Jose Mourinho's tenure at Chelsea - just over two seasons - the figure is exceptionally high - 45%. Although his team ultimately won a higher proportion of their league games, there were fewer goals in them, which is why half-time draws were so common. Over the next four weekends, there is a series of potential mismatches in the Premiership, starting on Sunday when Reading take on Arsenal at the Madejski Stadium. Keep an eye on the half-time draw prices - they will represent value for money to punters if any bookmaker offers odds that are better than these: 6-4 for Reading against Arsenal, 8-5 for Sheffield United against Chelsea, 13-8 for Liverpool against Reading and 12-5 for Chelsea against Watford.
