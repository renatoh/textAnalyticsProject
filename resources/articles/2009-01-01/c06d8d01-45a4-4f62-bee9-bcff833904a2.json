Andrew Cooper, the clerk of the course, will inspect again tomorrow morning but reported \"a big improvement\" following freezing temperatures earlier in the week. \"We will look again on Saturday morning,\" said Cooper. \"There has been a big improvement despite the temperature not rising above 3C [on Wednesday].\" Cooper yesterday said that 95% of the Sandown course was raceable and, with the help of protective covers, he was \"extremely optimistic\" that tomorrow's card would go ahead, despite the threat of frost returning tonight. \"It is quite a logistical exercise,\" said Cooper. \"We may get some of the covers that were used at Cheltenham this week, but they are due to come from the contractors based in Northampton. Hopefully all the sections will arrive in time tomorrow to cover the entire course. I am given every indication that we should be OK.\" Frost has put paid to Ayr's cards today and tomorrow, while Wincanton, tomorrow's other scheduled jumps meeting, is subject to an inspection this morning. \"It's supposed to be minus one tonight and should get to plus four tomorrow during the day,\" said the clerk of the course, Barry Johnson. \"If that is the case . . . we'll have a sporting chance.\" Today's card at Folkestone, where they could have raced yesterday, is subject to a precautionary inspection this morning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
