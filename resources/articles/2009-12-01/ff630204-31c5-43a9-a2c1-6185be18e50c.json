Alistair Darling said the boiler programme, similar to the \"cash-for-clunkers\" scheme which has reinvigorated the car industry, would help householders install one of the latest gas central heating boilers as part of the effort to cut carbon emissions and lower bills. Darling warned consumers living with the oldest boilers that they were wasting on average \u00a3200 a year because of higher gas bills. Older models also yearly emitted a tonne of carbon more than the most energy efficient types, he said. A Treasury spokesman said details of the programme were not yet finished with regard to talks with the plumbing industry, which had fought a long campaign to get the measure introduced. It is understood that, irrespective of income, a \u00a3400 grant will be available to everyone provided a sum, typically of about \u00a32,000, is used to buy and install a new boiler. To be eligible, households will have to have a \"working\" G-rated boiler, those categorised as least efficient. The measure, which is expected to cost the Treasury \u00a350m, will come into force \"at the earliest opportunity in 2010\". The industry, which is expected to administer the payments, warned tonight that the scheme could quickly run out of money. There are thought to be in excess of 4m old, inefficient, boilers in UK homes that would qualify for the grant. Phil Bentley, managing director of British Gas, said: \"To ensure take up is widespread it is vital the programme is made simple and easy for households to access.\" Will Marples, energy expert at uSwitch.com, said: \"Heating and hot water account for \u00a3756 a year on average so it makes absolute sense to focus energy efficiency efforts here. But for this to really work we'd like to see poorer families and vulnerable groups able to benefit from the scheme alongside existing grants.\" Separately, the chancellor told the Commons he would be giving a further \u00a3200m to the Warm Front scheme to pay for energy improvements such as cavity wall and loft insulation for the poorest households, although it later emerged that the figure was actually \u00a3150m. Darling said the money would be used to help an additional 75,000 households. In a move geared to encouraging micro-generation, the chancellor said householders installing wind turbines or solar panels and planning to sell excess power back to the grid, would receive their payment tax-free when the \"feed-in tariff\" scheme began in April. Ed Matthew, Friends of the Earth campaigner, said: \"The PBR was a golden opportunity for the chancellor to demonstrate genuine global leadership in developing a low-carbon future, but he has chosen to be timid when he needed to be bold. The economy doesn't need green tinkering, it needs a complete low-carbon overhaul.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
