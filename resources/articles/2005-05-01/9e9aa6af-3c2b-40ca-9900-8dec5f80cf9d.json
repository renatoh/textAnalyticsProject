Every glossy page speaks of campuses filled with a happy mix of grinning students from every background - though somewhat inevitably these images bear more testament to the skill of the public relations teams behind them than the success of the innumerable attempts to widen access to higher education. But then, what's new? The sun doesn't shine on every university 365 days a year, either, and you would never guess that by looking at the literature they produce. And, at first glance, the state of participation in higher education isn't lamentable. Every university boasts schemes and targets to widen access, and with no small success in many cases. Looking specifically at students from ethnic communities, they account for almost 15% of graduate output in the country, which compares favourably with the proportion of people from ethnic minorities in the population as a whole. Those figures, however, conceal certain persistent differences. Ethnic minority students tend to be concentrated in particular subject groups and are still under-represented at certain universities. While some universities can boast a student population with a third or more of students from ethnic minority backgrounds, others can only offer a small proportion. As with colour, so with class: the universities that are best at expanding access to ethnic minority groups also excel at attracting students from backgrounds with no tradition of pursuing higher education, not least because these two groups overlap to a large extent. The universities with most to do in this area, it will come as little surprise to learn, are the older, more established institutions, perceived as being traditional and conservative. Not that these universities have no interest in the cause. At Durham, for example, there are many measures in place to widen participation, especially within the local community. \"We are a university with an international outlook,\" says Matthew Andrews, head of undergraduate admissions at the university. \"We want to be a university of global standing and reputation, but we are a university in the north-east of England and that is just as important to us.\" To that end, the university has established the Queen's campus at Stockton in order to open up a Durham education to people throughout the Tees valley. \"We're equally committed to widening participation on both campuses,\" says Andrews. \"It's not the case that we do it there so we don't have to do it in Durham. But part of its mission is to widen access and it does that very well.\" Many of Durham's programmes for boosting participation are to do with increasing aspiration and expectations among local state school students - day visits, summer schools and overnight stays are all part of the plan. There are even schemes that encourage parents of potential students to come and stay the night in Durham to get a sense of what the university is like. Andrews recognises that the factor that would repel some students is the same thing which attracts so many others: its reputation. \"Our policy is to get people over the hurdle of their preconceptions and misconceptions about Durham.\" One perception about Durham and other universities of its ilk, however, is that in a largely white, middle-class institution (very often located in a largely white, middle-class area), students from different backgrounds tend to stand out more than they would elsewhere. The University of Luton, on the other hand, prides itself on the diversity of its student population. \"We think we've got one of the most diverse student bodies in the country,\" says Steve Kendall, Luton's director of student recruitment. \"Over a third of our students come from ethnic minority backgrounds and approaching a half are mature students.\" In part, this is down to Luton's location. \"Probably around a half of our students come from the immediate area,\" Kendall says, \"but the rest don't and we still end up with a very diverse student body.\" Just as the image of the traditional universities might impede their attempts to widen participation, Luton's, and those of universities like it, helps. \"Our reputation plays a big part in our success,\" says Kendall. \"For example, we recruit strongly in Luton, but also in Leicester. The communities in the two areas are inter-linked and we're regarded highly in both. We have that reputation for diversity which means students from different backgrounds are able to imagine themselves here.\" Luton has also noticed that areas in it vicinity that are \"cold\" areas for higher education recruitment on a national scale are often those from which the university recruits most successfully. \"It's because we're local and we offer an educational experience that fits with their expectations,\" says Kendall. That experience includes extensive academic support for students who need it, flexible teaching and the option to study in a higher education college local to you. According to Kendall, the difference is one of core values. \"Luton is about access to higher education; that's embedded in our culture,\" he says. \"There are many universities that would have to make a marked cultural shift in order to be able to achieve what we have done, because historically they have been pursuing a different mission. That's not an argument for homogenisation of higher education. I don't think every university has to be the same, but if the point of difference is the equality of opportunity to go there, then that's a problem that needs to be addressed.\" The benefits of having a diverse student body go beyond a simple case of doing the right thing, according to Professor Uduak Archibong, professor of diversity at the University of Bradford. \"It's a practical advantage, too. You widen the pool of high-quality people you will attract,\" she says. \"A diverse population increases creativity because it brings new perspectives and ideas. And it helps the corporate image of a university because people link a diverse body of people with the idea of success; it means lots of different types of people are happy to be there.\" The way to tackle the issue of widening access comes down to perception, she says. \"When an individual can identify with the values of an institution, they're happy to be there.\" The question of what determines an individual's perception of themselves in terms of higher education is, naturally, a wider issue. \"Ultimately, we may be dependent on things changing that we can't change,\" says Kendall. \"We need kids coming up through the pre-HE education system with the aspiration and capacity to achieve in higher education. But, in the meantime, we do what we can.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
