Tower Hamlets social services, the London council which has responsibility for the baby\u2019s welfare, asked a high court judge to intervene in the case after the man and his partner, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, failed to register the child\u2019s birth earlier this year. Mr Justice Hayden ruled the council had the right to step in as the child\u2019s \u201cinstitutional parent\u201d to register the birth. The judge considered the issue at a private hearing earlier this month in the family division of the high court in London and outlined his decision in a written ruling published online. The child, referred to in the case only as T, is currently the subject of a care order while his parents are \u201csubject to a residential assessment\u201d. The judge was told that the couple\u2019s parenting skills were being assessed before decisions about the boy\u2019s long-term future were made. He also noted that the father\u2019s behaviour towards a judge in the family court resulted in a prison sentence for him and his partner. Hayden said the couple\u2019s deliberate decision not to register the birth stemmed from the boy\u2019s father\u2019s unusual and somewhat eccentric beliefs about the concept of personal sovereignty. He said the boy\u2019s mother was not prepared to register the birth herself, but was not opposed to somebody else registering it. He said the father had a genuinely held belief in the power and writ of the individual. The father told the judge: \u201cWe are each our own sovereign. We are governed by a common law but only to the extent that we depart from three principles. These three imperatives are: to do no harm; to cause no loss; to inflict no injury.\u201d The judge said the father regarded registering a birth as the equivalent of making an entry on to a ship\u2019s manifest. He argued that registering the birth would make the child \u201can asset to the country, which has boarded a vessel to sail on the high seas\u201d. The judge added the essence of the father\u2019s objection was \u201chis belief that registration will cause his son to become controlled by a state which he perceives to be authoritarian and capricious\u201d. Hayden pointed out that the 1953 Births and Deaths Registration Act required a birth to be registered within 42 days of a child being born. He ruled: \u201cIt is manifestly in T\u2019s best interest for his birth to be registered, in order that he may be recognised as a citizen and entitled to the benefits of such citizenship.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
