A team including the secretary-general Taiwo Ogunjobi arrived in London for the meeting. Robson, 46, was not among six foreigners, including the Frenchmen Bruno Metsu and Alain Giresse, on the shortlist for the job in August but an NFA official said: \"Now we want to hire a coach from the region we have many of our overseas-based players, for easier negotiations with clubs.\" Many of Nigeria's national team players, including the captain Jay-Jay Okocha and the strikers Nwankwo Kanu and Ayegbeni Yakubu, are based in England and the NFA has recently been in dispute with overseas clubs over the release of players for international engagements. The Nigeria coach Christian Chukwu has been criticised by his compatriots for not being technically equipped for the job and the NFA is desperate to hire a foreigner in time for January's African Nations Cup in Tunisia. The former England captain refused to comment on the talks and the NFA is planning to meet Giresse today. He was a member of France's 1984 European Championship-winning team and is currently coaching Rabat in Morocco. The NFA official said some candidates, including Metsu, were unavailable. Blackburn will recall Andy Todd from his loan spell at Burnley at the end of the week to strengthen their weakened defence. Markus Babbel and Craig Short are expected to be out injured for the whole of October and Lucas Neill still has two games of a suspension to complete. The Blackburn manager Graeme Souness said : \"We are going to recall Andy from his loan spell. He will be coming back to us because we are short on numbers.\" Todd moved on loan after putting in a transfer request in the summer. He will return to Ewood Park after playing for Burnley against Walsall on Saturday. Babbel is expected to be out until the middle of November after tearing a thigh muscle on Sunday against Fulham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
