Now there are two teams in clear contention for the Championship. While England and Ireland may quibble with that assertion, on form - so far - Wales and France look set to decide the title between them in the final fixture of the entire tournament, to be played in Cardiff at five o'clock on March 15. Curiously the most palpable improvements weren't shown by either of the two teams who won today, but by the sides they defeated. Scotland were poor, again, but at least had Chris Paterson's boot to keep them in contention. His perfect kicking performance re-exposed Frank Hadden's folly in leaving him out of the opening game against France. Still, that man aside, there was little to enjoy about Scotland's game, which was riddled with a mediocrity that suggests they'll do well to avoid winning a second consecutive wooden spoon. Ireland's second half almost qualified as a revelation, being the best 40 minutes of rugby they've played since this time last year. They had more hustle about them, the introduction of Andrew Trimble into midfield, Jamie Heaslip into the back row and Bernard Jackman in the loose, had an invigorating effect on what had become a terribly stale side. Trimble in particular brought a ballast to the centre that contrasted strongly with what had been seen in Gordon D'Arcy's recent games there. They will need to do more, far more, to convince Eddie O'Sullivan's legions of doubters that he is still worthy of his job but a worse defeat today - and with the score at one stage being 26-6 the result could have veered towards the truly horrific - would have made his position almost untenable. That his side were able to summon sufficient inspiration to comeback to within five points of the win will count for him given how low expectations were at half-time. France were culpable for provoking the pressure that Ireland heaped on them. Marc Lievremont's extraordinarily bold decision to substitute his half-backs and field a pair of substitutes, Francois Trinh-Dunc and Morgan Parra, with a combined age of just 40, came within a whisper of backfiring on him. It was his pack that gave the most ground though, buckling as the game went on and allowing the Irish to assert a domination in the scrum that brought them back into the game. The temptation is to flatter the Irish a little too much. They did still lose after all. France in the first half were absolutely ferocious at the break down, led by the fine combination of Thierry Dusautoir, Julian Bonnaire and Fulgence Ouedraogo. The violence with which the French forwards marshalled the contact area in the first half prompted Ireland into making mistakes, which were then ruthlessly capitalised upon by that extraordinarily potent back three. The interlacing runs of Cedric Heymans and Vincent Clerc being further enriched in this match by the more powerful thrusts of Aurelien Rougerie. Clerc's first half hat-trick gave further notice that on current form there is no better finisher in world rugby. Shane Williams ran him close earlier that day, his two finishes marked more by his extraordinary side-step rather than the pure speed that Clerc relies on. Wales, like France, were again a little unconvincing in victory. God knows what they'd have to do to actually raise smiles on the faces of Warren Gatland and Shaun Edwards, who sat with brows furrowed in stony condemnation throughout. Whereas France almost slipped up with their tactical changes at half-back, Wales used the same ploy to better effect. Stephen Jones and Dwayne Peel imposing a structure on their play that had been lacking under James Hook and Mike Phillips. Oddly, no one team has played an entirely convincing 80 minutes yet, and we're still without a clear favourite. But the impetus is definitely with the new coaches in Paris and Cardiff, leaving the incumbents elsewhere slouching towards mid-table."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
