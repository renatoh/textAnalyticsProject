A 27 March situation report (SitRep) document produced by the Unified Command of Washington\u2019s State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) projects that a combination of acute demand at food banks and schools, supply problems for food and cleaning supplies, plus staffing shortages, will mean government and NGOs will struggle to provide for hungry people whose incomes have disappeared as the state\u2019s economy stutters. This raises the prospect of food bank shortages in Washington but also nationwide, as food banks across the US are being increasingly utilized by unprecedented numbers of people in an economy that has been abruptly slowed to fight the spreading pandemic. Washington state has experienced one of the earliest and most serious outbreaks of Covid-19 in the US. Governor Jay Inslee has received praise in recent days for his decisive response, which is thought to have prevented an even worse crisis. But the document suggests that at the predicted peak of the epidemic, which has already infected at least 4,896 Washingtonians and killed at least 195, the state will need to head off a parallel humanitarian crisis. The SitRep document, produced by the emergency agency coordinated by Washington state\u2019s military department and distributed to state and local agencies involved in the emergency response, details emerging problems and frantic efforts to solve them across a range of numbered emergency support functions (ESF), including communications, firefighting, and energy. Under the heading \u201cESF11 Agriculture and Natural Resources\u201d, the SitRep details the growing problems in food security. Many of the problems involve food banks \u2013 non-governmental organizations that deliver food to needy people. The document says there is already a \u201cshortage of food at food banks\u201d, which is projected to become worse. It says: \u201cNGOs have food on hand. However, burn rate is increasing fast. Demand is growing dramatically so supply is quickly being used up.\u201d It goes on to warn: \u201cFood banks expect a significant gap in the food supply across the whole system by mid-April (April 10-20).\u201d It then offers insight into spiking demand at specific NGOs delivering food in Washington: \u201cNorthwest Harvest (a statewide food bank service) reported they are distributing 450,000lbs of food this week.\u201d It continues: \u201cThe burn rate and demand are rising sharply. These NGOs are seeing 30 percent to 100% increases in the number of people served.\u201d In a telephone conversation, Northwest Harvest chief executive Thomas Reynolds said of his food banks: \u201cWe don\u2019t predict peak demand for another three weeks and then we anticipate peak demand for 12 to 20 weeks.\u201d He added: \u201cI worked for 15 years for Care International. So what it reminds me of is earthquakes in Nepal, the tsunami in Japan, food crises in Yemen. And the difference is there\u2019s a lot more experience in a place like Nepal or Yemen to respond to emergencies.\u201d The document says rural counties are already moving to rationalize food delivery in the face of demand. \u201cChelan county is moving away from using small distribution centers. Instead they are going to start using a single, mass-distribution site for emergency food,\u201d it says. It continues with a prediction: \u201cIt\u2019s a model we will likely see more of in the days and weeks to come.\u201d On Wednesday, Inslee, announced he had mobilized 130 National Guard members to provide support for food banks in Chelan and four other counties, with potentially more to follow. The problems are being compounded by supply problems in other goods necessary for food service, such as supplies used to clean kitchens. As in other states, Washington has closed schools, but many districts have maintained school lunch delivery as a way of feeding needy children. These programs, too, are under strain, according to the SitRep. One issue is in the workforce, which \u201cis a growing issue because schools rely on older people to work in food service and as bus drivers. These are two job categories important to food assistance.\u201d The document says \u201colder workers are opting not to work because of Covid concerns\u201d and that schools are also experiencing supply problems. The document does offer some hope that solutions to shortages are emerging, but leaves open the question of whether they will arrive in time. \ufeffChris McGann, a spokesman for the Washington state department of agriculture, said in an email: \u201cThe current situation with its rapidly increasing demand and limited resources is putting incredible strain on the social safety net. Hunger relief is no different.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have called on the federal government and private industry to identify and commit additional resources to help us make sure families have the nutritional support they need to make it through this crisis.\u201d He also said that the problem was so far confined to food banks. \u201cThe food supply chain is otherwise operational and functional. People will still be able to get food at the grocery store.\u201d Reynolds stressed that Northwest Harvest was working well with the state and has \u201cgood relationship with our local elected officials\u201d. But he said he hoped food security will become more central to political debate. \u201cI think we should be asking people who are running for office. What is your food policy?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
