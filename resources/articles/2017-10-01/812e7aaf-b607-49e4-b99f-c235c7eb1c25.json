Rosanna, not Patricia, has spoken about unwelcome sexual advances to her from Weinstein (11 October, page 1). \u2022 When, in an editorial about the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s low productivity growth estimates for Britain, we said that before the financial crisis we would have expected \u201cthe economy\u201d to double in size every 40 years, we meant to say \u201cliving standards\u201d (Britain faces a bleak future without gains from growth, 11 October, page 28). \u2022 Our obituary of the picture editor John Morris misnamed his third wife Tana Hoban, as Tara (7 October, page 38).
