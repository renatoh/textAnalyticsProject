In an interview with Guardian Australia Chitralekha Massey, spoke at length about Australia\u2019s offshore detention policies. She said Australia\u2019s detention of asylum seekers on Nauru \u201cis unsustainable, it\u2019s a violation and it\u2019s unnecessary\u201d. The continuing reports of abuse, self-harm and sexual assault had created an alarming environment at the centre that Massey said needed be resolved. The Guardian\u2019s publication of the Nauru files has put the treatment and conditions of asylum seekers held on the Pacific island back into the spotlight. Massey said that the asylum seekers held on Nauru had to be given the opportunity to resettle in Australia or another country if they had been found to be refugees. United Nations general assembly and a key migration summit hosted by the United States president, Barack Obama, will be held next week. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, will be both be in attendance. Massey encouraged the Australian government to bring an end to the detention of men, woman and children on Nauru, where hundreds of asylum seekers languished in \u201cnot only prolonged, but indefinite\u201d detention. Massey\u2019s team completed an inspection of the Nauru centre in August 2016. She said the situation in the past two years had been \u201caggravated even further\u201d, based on the observations of her office\u2019s latest visit. \u201cWe have repeatedly reported our concerns around healthcare, around education, access to justice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are particularly concerned about the sexual violence and the number of rapes against women, against children. The amount of self-harm that is really an indicator of how bad the mental health of people has deteriorated.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to find words to describe how somebody can go from being at a breaking point and just continue to be at a breaking point endlessly. \u201cThere is an urgent response required.\u201d In response to Dutton\u2019s comments that Australia\u2019s regional processing relationship with Nauru would continue for \u201cdecades\u201d she said: \u201cIt\u2019s already unacceptable.\u201d She urged Australia to adopt a \u201cnon-custodial\u201d approach to migration and those seeking asylum: \u201cThere is a better way to do this.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very important that the children on Nauru receive, with urgency, the chance for normal lives.\u201d She said she looked favourably at the Australian Human Rights Commission\u2019s recent report Pathways to Protection, which canvassed a number of options to encourage a more humane and regional response from Australia. She also noted that while the detention centre on Nauru moved to an \u201copen centre\u201d arrangement in October 2015, asylum seekers held on the island still lived in \u201cmilitarised, police-like\u201d arrangements. She also urged Australia to take up a greater regional role in bolstering the human rights framework of neighbouring Pacific countries. The UN office continues to focus on other aspects of Australia\u2019s approach to human rights. Massey said the office remained concerned about the juvenile justice system, Indigenous affairs and gender-based violence in the community. \u201cWe are very concerned that juvenile justice seems to be almost the norm rather than the exception,\u201d she said. A royal commission is due to to begin shortly into the Northern Territory\u2019s juvenile justice system."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
