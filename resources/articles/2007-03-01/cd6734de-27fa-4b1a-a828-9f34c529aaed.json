One can see why Richard B. Frank had difficulty finding \"a first class publication\" in the US to print his attack. I'm surprised he found one in Britain. First of all, as to the career in journalism for which George is chiefly known, Frank does not mention, much less discuss or attempt to refute, a single story that George published or broadcast in his years of reporting for the Herald Tribune and CBS. As to my brother's service during the second world war. Frank's obsession focuses on a claim made 42 years after George's death by one of his several biographers, Kati Marton in The Polk Conspiracy , that George shot down 11 Japanese aircraft. But the fact is that George never made such a claim and Marton was alerted to her mistake after publication of the book. The official record shows that George was one of the earliest naval officers to land on Guadalcanal where he helped to establish the airfield. He was decorated for this and other actions with the Presidential Unit Citation which, as Frank acknowledges elsewhere, is the equivalent of the Navy's second highest medal. Frank's article concludes that George created forgeries of all these documents from several different military agencies. For this he offers no proof or motive. But George's war record is irrelevant to his work as a journalist.It is that reputation which the George Polk Awards recall. In his attempt to destroy this reputation, Frank's character assassination is almost as evil as the physical assassination 59 years ago. William R. Polk, Vence, France Curb cost of calls The underhand tactics used by TV companies in the latest exposures (The dark side of TV, March 12) could be stopped at a stroke if the regulators lowest the cost of calls to their real price: mere pennies. How was it possible for any calls to cost 75p, \u00a31 or \u00a31.50? Our light touch regulators seem to be in thrall to commercial concerns, and predictably, the public gets ripped off as usual. Imagine the outcry if print media ran competitions that required a \u00a31 stamp on the envelope as a condition of entry, so that a bit of revenue sharing could be indulged in with Royal Mail. The high cost of calls is just a license to print money. How else did ITV Play make a profit of \u00a320m on a turnover of \u00a354m? Robin Benson, Southampton Time to take the lead Anthony Lilley is quite right to suggest there is \"an urgent need to do something about the sophistication of media literacy in our society\" (The lesson that eBay can teach the TV companies, March 12). The Media Education Association's inaugural conference in May is addressing this issue. Part of the problem that media education faces is the usually dismissive tone taken by media practitioners; in this respect the Guardian is little better than the Daily Mail. Media literacy should be a central aspect of education and MediaGuardian could take a lead in ensuring the debate about media literacy is a sensible one.
