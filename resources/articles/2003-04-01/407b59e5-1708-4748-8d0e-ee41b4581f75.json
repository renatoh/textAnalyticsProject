The British yachtswoman's round-the-world record attempt with a 13-man crew in the Jules Verne Challenge came to an ignominious end five weeks ago when the boat jolted forward and the mast snapped. So for her next quest she will be on her own, the 110ft catamaran Kingfisher2 replaced with a 75ft trimaran. \"I have always loved the ocean,\" she said. \"Strangely, though I have learned that I really enjoy sailing with others, there still remains a massive attraction for me to sail solo.\" She began to plan the boat immediately after finishing second in the Vend\u00e9e Globe, the solo round-the-world race, three years ago. Though there were plans for her to race on the 60ft trimaran circuit as a crew for some of the most successful French skippers, she longed to pitch herself and a suitable boat against the elements and the clock. She began by talking with the French-based British multihull designer Nigel Irens about the perfect vessel for the purpose. The result is a three-hull machine with the single focus of breaking solo records. High on the list will be the transatlantic and the 24-hour record, both held by Laurent Bourgnon of France since 1994. Irens, a famously understated talent in multihulls, expressed considerable enthusiasm for this project. \"Designing a boat like this for her,\" he said, \"is an incredibly exciting challenge. In particular, having a blank sheet of paper without the restriction of a class rule allows us to explore the best combination of performance, safety and reliability.\" He will oversee the construction of the trimaran in Sydney. It is due to be completed towards the end of this year and MacArthur will be able to begin her record-chasing once the boat arrives in England. It is a formula that mirrors the New Zealand build and launch of MacArthur's beloved 60ft monohull Kingfisher, and will provide her with many early opportunities to refine the boat and its gear. The machine will be of all carbon-fibre construction, with every effort made to save weight but with sufficient in-built strength to cope with extremes of wind and waves. Modern trimarans are often sailed with only the leeward hull in the water, the other two flying, and MacArthur will perfect the technique over the summer with the eminent French skipper Alain Gautier before she finally gets her hands on her new champion of the seas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
