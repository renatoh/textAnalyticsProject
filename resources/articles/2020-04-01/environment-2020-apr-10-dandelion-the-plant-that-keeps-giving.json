Only those plants that had flourished all summer were used, as they had more goodness. The roots went deep and were carefully dug up, scrubbed clean and dried overnight in a low oven. Stored in an old biscuit tin until wanted, they were then roasted in a hot oven and ground up for coffee. They were too bitter for us kids who drank \u201cmilk and a dash\u201d (of tea). We fed our rabbits on the leaves that were too tough to eat. There were 75 in all: kept in cages in our back yard. One of my jobs after school was to search for rabbit food in the field at the back. (However, I could never eat them.) Also, warts were painted with dandelion juice.
