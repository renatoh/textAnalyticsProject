You can survive them, he said, but there is always scar tissue. In Manchester the condition has been known as Cityitis ever since Joe Royle coined the term a couple of seasons ago. Outbreaks have become increasingly sporadic but this winter the symptoms have returned and a ju-ju man may soon be needed if City are to recover before the damage becomes irreparable. This was a humbling, a capitulation and a wake-up call rolled into one. It had been brewing for several weeks and the depressing reality for Royle is that his side have now taken only five points from their last 11 games. Every team is entitled to a sticky patch but City's is beginning to take on the texture of quicksand. It would be remiss to detract from a Charlton performance that brutally exposed their hosts' frailties. Whereas City's game plan seems based on the pandemonium theory, Alan Curbishley has constructed a team combining equal measures of industry and enterprise who should survive the relegation fray with room to spare. For all the talk of possible demotion, they will host Arsenal this afternoon having placed a tentative toe in the terra incognita of the Premiership's top 10. City, on the other hand, will travel to Coventry having dropped into the relegation zone for the first time this season. Previous outbreaks of Cityitis have shown it to be as much a state of mind as anything else and the damage Saturday will have done to their notoriously brittle confidence is indisputable. Nowhere does the fans' anxiety affect the players' minds more than Maine Road and, by the close of play, there were some in blue who looked bilious with fear, blanketed by self-doubt. \"Am I allowed to swear?\" asked Steve Howey, culpable for two of Charlton's goals after displaying a turn of foot reminiscent of Chief Bromden in Milos Forman's One Flew over the Cuckoo Nest. Howey was not the only one to squirm with discomfort, however. The crowd's bile has been worse, far worse, but it was never far from the surface and sufficiently vitriolic for Royle to withdraw the unpopular Laurent Charvet after only 40 minutes. The French right-back, alas, was having what is commonly known in these parts as \"a Richard Edghill\". City's manager spoke of a necessity for \"fundamental changes\", which suggests he means both in personnel and his own philosophies. \"At the moment we're finding it harder at home than on our travels,\" he said. \"But if I was a supporter and had sat through that, I would sympathise with anything they had to say. We were abject and there's no point pretending otherwise.\" Once Howey had played an assist for Jonatan Johansson's opening goal it was, indeed, an air of inevitability that descended from the leaden skies. A slack clearance by Nicky Weaver was the catalyst for Johansson's second on 37 minutes and, in truth, the result was a foregone conclusion long before Graham Stuart tucked in a penalty for Howey's foul on John Robinson. Charlton, led by the 20-year-old Scott Parker and the 19-year-old Paul Konchesky, were irrepressible. City being City, there was still time for the ridiculous and it was duly provided a minute from time when Richard Dunne's attempted clearance ricocheted off Claus Jensen and over Weaver from fully 40 yards for a goal that will inevitably find its way into the archives of A Question of Sport's What Happened Next? Tragi-comedy, City style. Against a side who had lost their previous six away games, City could not muster a shot on target until the debutant Darren Huckerby was awarded and converted a charitable penalty in stoppage-time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
