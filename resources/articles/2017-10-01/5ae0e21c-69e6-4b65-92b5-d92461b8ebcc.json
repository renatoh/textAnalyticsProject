This marked quite a way to deliver on long\u2011heralded promise. McIlroy\u2019s attempt to end 2017 with at least one victory remains alive but only in respect of one event; he will shut down for the year after the Dunhill Links Championship next weekend. Even a closing 36 holes comprising only 127 shots, a record for McIlroy as a professional, was not sufficient to deny the nerveless Dunne. The 24-year-old, who shot to prominence as an amateur at the 2015 Open Championship, has endured a frustrating time when seeking to make his name in the professional ranks. Dunne was denied his maiden win in April when Edoardo Molinari defeated him in a play-off in Morocco. At Close House there was no such trouble; Dunne\u2019s three-stroke success, at 20 under, was capped by a chip-in from off the 18th green. McIlroy could only look on and applaud. \u201cI had a couple of chances to win earlier in the year and didn\u2019t really press the accelerator when I needed to,\u201d Dunne said. \u201cSo I woke up this morning and said to myself I was going to try and win this thing rather than let anyone hand it to me.\u201d A glance back to the Hassan Trophy triggered a Dunne smile. \u201cI think Edoardo finished birdie-eagle to get into the play-off so I was kind of waiting for the scoreboard here to show a McIlroy hole in one at the last.\u201d Dunne will pocket \u20ac562,500 for his effort but the bigger picture relates to a move into the world\u2019s top 100 ranked players and an incentive, surely, to push for a spot in Europe\u2019s 2018 Ryder Cup team. McIlroy started the final day two off the lead, then held by Robert Karlsson, with his chances apparently remote when only two under for the day after 11 holes. But he played the closing stretch in minus five. \u201cIt was just nice to have a chance to win a golf tournament again,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cThat was a big thing for me. The more chances I have like that, I think the better I play and the better I focus. I\u2019m really happy with how I played. I don\u2019t feel as if I could have done much more. Some weeks close to your best isn\u2019t quite good enough.\u201d \u201cAt the turn I thought if I could play the back nine in four under I would have a chance at 17 under par so I did everything that I wanted to do. For Paul to shoot 61 to win his first tour event is incredibly impressive. And it is well deserved; I know how hard he works. Any time I am on the range, on the putting green or chipping, Paul is always out there working on his game.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really happy with how I played. I don\u2019t feel as if I could have done much more. Some weeks , close to your best isn\u2019t quite good enough.\u201d Karlsson finished third at 16 under. Ian Poulter closed with a 70 to share 11th, with Lee Westwood\u2019s Sunday 69 earning him a tie for 15th."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
