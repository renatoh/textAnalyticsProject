Hull KR remain second in the table but were clearly second best to a Giants team who included only two overseas players in their 17 and defied the absence of their inspirational Australian captain Brett Hodgson to climb to joint third with Leeds, only a point behind Rovers. After reaching the Challenge Cup semi- finals last weekend with a far less convincing performance against Castleford, these are exciting times for the ambitious Giants, who following the appointment of the well-respected Australian coach Nathan Brown are showing signs that they may now be ready to deliver. \"It wasn't a pretty game, but we controlled things pretty well,\" said Brown, who highlighted the contributions of Scott Moore and Eorl Crabtree, the two Huddersfield players who have been included in the England team for next Saturday's Test in France. \"Eorl's been great for us all year, and for Scotty to be playing hooker for his country at the age of 20 shows he's going pretty well. He's going to be a much better player when he's 23 or 24.\" Moore will be playing for St Helens by then, as he was released on loan to Castleford last year and Huddersfield this to ensure his readiness to succeed Keiron Cunningham when he retires either this season or next. On this evidence, that policy will pay off handsomely, as Moore opened the scoring with a Cunningham-esque effort from acting half, and provided a slick final pass for further tries from Lee Mossop and Michael Lawrence. For Rovers, this was a second consecutive defeat following their extra-time heartbreak against Warrington in the cup last weekend, but their coach Justin Morgan will not be overly concerned. It was one of those nights when their execution was slightly awry as, in the absence of Jake Webster and Paul Cooke, they lacked the punch and composure to break down a resolute Huddersfield defence in which the second-row Andy Raleigh was outstanding. \"We were very flat, and our forwards got outplayed,\" Morgan admitted. \"We didn't have the sort of enthusiasm that's taken us so far this season, and they did. We've got to dig our heels in now.\" Moore and Raleigh may have made the most significant contributions to Huddersfield's win, but Crabtree's was the most spectacular. The huge, pony-tailed forward - to whom no reference would be compete without a mention of his late uncle Shirley, the wrestler Big Daddy - flattened Rovers' veteran forward Nick Fozzard with his first drive after his introduction midway through the first half. By that stage the Giants led 12-6, having followed Moore's opener with an excellent move to which Luke Robinson applied a neat finish, only for Rovers to hit back through Kris Welham's try from Ben Galea's pass. They would have been out of sight if not for a series of try-saving tackles from Shaun Briscoe, showing why he will be England's full-back in Paris. Instead Rovers might have pulled level if their other call-up, Peter Fox, had not been denied a try by the video referee Thierry Alibert. But Mossop's Moore-inspired try gave the Giants some breathing space, and after half an hour of tense second-half combat, Lawrence slid over for the clincher.
