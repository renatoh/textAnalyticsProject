Life, Simpson says, \u201cis fine\u201d. Simpson, 71, is in good health and high spirits, according to an interview published by the Associated Press on Monday. The 1968 Heisman Trophy winner said neither he nor his children wanted to talk about the murder on 12 June 1994 of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman \u2013 or the so-called \u201ctrial of the century\u201d that ensued. Simpson was found not guilty in 1995, and continues to maintain his innocence. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to go back and relive the worst day of our lives,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cThe subject of the moment is the subject I will never revisit again. My family and I have moved on to what we call the \u2018no negative zone\u2019. We focus on the positives.\u201d Simpson has largely lived a quiet life following his release from prison in October 2017, after he had served nine years for kidnapping and robbery. He said he thinks his conviction for attempting to steal back memorabilia items was not fair, but said: \u201cI believe in the legal system and I honored it. I served my time.\u201d Simpson\u2019s two younger children live in Florida, and work in real estate. He said his friends convinced him to stay in Las Vegas after his time in jail. \u201cThe town has been good to me,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cEverybody I meet seems to be apologizing for what happened to me here.\u201d Simpson did run into trouble shortly after his release, being banned from the Cosmopolitan resort following a dispute. But otherwise life has gone smoothly, he said. He is popular among selfie-seeking tourists and plays golf almost every day with a club of other \u201cretired guys\u201d. The former USC and Buffalo Bills running back said he has had knee replacement surgery and a procedure to improve his vision. He said his parole officer permits him to take short trips to Florida for family visits. His older daughter mostly lives with him in Las Vegas, but frequently travels to Los Angeles. \u2018\u201cI\u2019ve been to Florida two or three times to see the kids and my old buddies in Miami,\u201d he said. \u201cI even managed to play a game of golf with them. But I live in a town I\u2019ve learned to love. Life is fine.\u201d Such extensive family time has also reportedly included a wedding which brought his brother, sister, nieces and nephews to Vegas \u2013 as well as his first wife, Marguerite. After Simpson left the NFL, he worked as a sports commentator and \u201ccommercial pitchman\u201d for companies such as Hertz. He also worked as an actor, in movies such as The Naked Gun. Although Simpson was acquitted over the deaths of Brown and Goldman, their families sued him in civil court on the grounds of wrongful death, and won a $33.5m judgment. Most of that sum has not been paid. Simpson would not discuss money, other than to say he supports himself with pensions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
