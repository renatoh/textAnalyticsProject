He left South Africa in 1975 on a one-way exit permit, after his barbed poetry riled the authorities, and spent 15 years in London, then spells in Moscow under perestroika, and Belgrade during the \"tribal wars\" in ex-Yugoslavia. Six months of every year are still spent travelling through Africa. Now aged 62, he has written nine novels, including the Booker-shortlisted Serenity House (1992), as well as poetry and short fiction, children's books, reportage and the memoir White Boy Running (1988). Much of his fiction returns to South Africa, through dark satire or grim farce. Hope's thoughts may have turned to escape when Signs of the Heart (1999), his barely disguised portrait of the village in which he has lived since the mid-1990s, was translated into French. Though he named it \"Kissac\", claiming the location and characters were fictitious composites, he drew heavily on real stories for a book subtitled \"Love and Death in Languedoc\". Readers from far and wide instantly recognised it as Caunes-Minervois, near Carcassone. The local hotelier, Hope notes with irony, signed copies, but \"the village is still divided between those who consider it 'cruel and unjust', in the words of the local doctor,\" and those who were merely \"furious because they weren't in it. I'm not sorry I did it, but you never get a free ride\". Those words may have contained a premonition about his latest novel, My Mother's Lovers, published last month by Atlantic Books (\u00a314.99), and this month in South Africa. The story of a Johannesburg pilot, Kathleen Healey, and her son Alexander, the novel is Hope's most savagely sardonic appraisal to date of the \"new South Africa\". Yet as Kathleen hunts, shoots and boxes her way freely across the continent, occasionally flying freedom fighters to safety, the novel first probes the ambiguous role of the \"white man\" in Africa, questioning whether \"pale Africans\" can ever be more than transient \"ghosts\". \"People from Europe, as well as Asia, made their way to Africa and sought an empty space they could fashion in their own image; they named, classified, codified it,\" says Hope. \"My forebears and others were infused with an extraordinary sense of power and privilege, and it turned them into clowns or killers.\" Africans were \"romanticised, like the Masai, or made into the invisible ones, who served then vanished.\" Now, he says, the Masai and others are saying, \"'You came, you took, and now we'd like our land back.' That feeling is immensely strong. It may be unjust, but it puts the question of European continuation in Africa under great scepticism.\" It is a problem \"very close to my heart: tolerated minorities who may never belong. My feelings are contradictory. As a writer, it's for me to observe and not be sentimental; it's not for the white farmers to insist they belong.\" He adds, \"The way white people, with their territoriality and testosterone, have connected with Africa is: if you can't kick, shoot, ride or eat it, what good is it? It's a pugilistic, violent form of attachment that I don't particularly like, and people who live in Africa have been at the point of it. That leads to extreme scepticism; when I hear the word 'Africa', I want to know who's using it.\" Through Alexander's relationship with his neglectful mother, the novel reflects Hope's own ambivalence, his \"passion for Africa born of love, but that's also deeply suspect when professed by a white African\". His character shares her name with Hope's own mother, Kathleen. \"My mother's generation felt they belonged, and that they owned whatever they could see,\" he says. Yet his character is a colossus who \"detests and overwhelms nationalistic and sexual boundaries and racial divisions. One wants to take the piss out of people who insist on walls, borders, and pomposities, the fatuities of power that Africa throws up. The sense I have is of the largeness of those I meet - the amplitude, openness, generosity - and the smallness of those who govern and often ruin them.\" South Africa after 1994 is pilloried for inadequate policies on HIV-Aids and hostility to migrants, its proliferation of walled fortress suburbs and political \"newspeak\". \"In Soweto people attend two to three funerals a day, with DJs and marquees, and many who run the country are in deep denial,\" says Hope. \"The people who suffer most from Aids, as from everyday violence, tend to be black.\" He has been strongly criticised for sniping from afar, and seeming to hint that the new South Africa - whose authorities banned a poem of his in 2000 that had been banned under apartheid - was as bad as the old. Donald Woods, writer and former editor of the Daily Dispatch in the Eastern Cape, objected that \"many of us ... went through worse punishments under the old apartheid regime than merely having our words banned\", while others pointed to the robustness of debate in the new democracy. \"People always say, 'how can you have a sense unless you live here?' says Hope, \"but I go back and listen.\" As for suggesting an equivalence between new and old, \"I wouldn't,\" he says. \"Things have changed emphatically for the better, but I see old patterns repeating. South Africa is as racially obsessed but in different ways. The forms of white nationalism we grew up with are mirrored in the new black nationalisms. Everyone who found apartheid not just cruel but militantly stupid thought we couldn't reproduce that.\" Hope was born in Johannesburg in 1944. His father, a pilot in the South African Air Force, was killed before the war ended. His mother went to live with her father Daniel, an Irish Catholic who ran a hotel bar in a small Transvaal town and was later mayor. They moved to a Johannesburg suburb, to what Hope sees as the twin catastrophes of the 1948 elections that ushered in grand apartheid and his mother's remarriage. He says: \"My mother married all the things I loathed, politically and personally, in South Africa; my stepfather and I were enemies.\" Hope's first novel, A Separate Development (1977), was a satirical comedy about a boyhood under apartheid - promptly banned in South Africa. But, after his mother's death in 1997, he returned to his childhood in a more strongly autobiographical novel, Heaven Forbid (2002). Six-year-old Martin loves his male nanny, the Zulu Georgie, about as much as he loathes his mother's suitor Gordon, a paragon of the male sports of kicking balls and servants, who is aghast at the Irish family's easy way with \"natives\". Hope says, \"My grandfather's family had a largeness, a lack of fear, that made it seem like a golden time lost. My mother never discussed it, but memory is the weapon. You can take notes.\" When he was eight, they moved to Pretoria, into an \"Irish ghetto - a small island of Catholics surrounded by carnivorous Calvinists\". He spoke English and Afrikaans, but knew that, for the Boers, second only to the \"black danger\" was the \"Roman danger\". Yet he shared the privileges of skin colour. It was only at the University of the Witwatersrand \"that the race divisions began to hit me. As a child you knew, but understanding wasn't much encouraged, along with reflection or reading.\" Books were an escape and an arsenal. \"I read everything - Richmal Crompton, Biggles, Huckleberry Finn. I enjoyed the oddness of my obsession. My mother used to say, 'promise me you'll make them last; don't gobble them'.\" Among his influences are Swift's A Modest Proposal (\"anger well managed\") and Mafeking Road by the South African humourist Herman Charles Bosman (\"he understood how ridiculous and hypocritical we are\"). Elvis was \"forbidden: this was negro music. It made him even more interesting.\" Hope worked as an editor for an Afrikaans publisher, and as an advertising copy writer, and started a little magazine, Bolt, whose contributors included the poet Mongane Serote, later an MP. \"Poetry was the major means of protest,\" says Hope. \"It was the way to annoy the hell out of the authorities and say something about the townships. The cameraderie and defiance were mind-tinglingly exciting.\" But they met with repression, and, for many, exile. He has two sons in their 30s: Jasper, a manager in London, and Daniel, a violinist with the Beaux Arts Trio who lives in Amsterdam. Hope's ex-wife Eleanor was manager to Yehudi Menuhin, a \"musical grandfather to my kids\". He now lives with his partner of some six years, Ingrid, a South African photographer turned interior designer. To write, he closets himself in a converted garage in the village, with a tiny skylight. But the couple also have a nearby retreat up La Montagne Noir, a simple stone shepherd's cottage lit by paraffin lamps, with majestic views of forested slopes. Hope once wondered if all the places he travelled to were \"not more than mirrors for the place I come from\". His study of tyranny, Brothers Under the Skin (2003), drew parallels - unconvincing for several reviewers - between Hendrik Verwoerd, architect of apartheid, and Zimbabwe's president Robert Mugabe. \"I go back again and again, to try to find out where I come from,\" Hope says. \"I've spent my entire life looking for something like home. I was homesick before I left, because my country never existed. It was a piece of political chicanery, a fiction of the imagination of those who governed us, a rare form of insanity that one lived. Everything large or generous or open or loving was forbidden or illegal. Everything I've written has been an answer to that.\" Yet he writes \"not to change the world but to undermine it\". However harsh the comedy, he says, \"I prefer the liberation and release of laughter to the boring repetition of tragedy and melodrama. The buckets of tears over [Alan Paton's novel] Cry, the Beloved Country never amounted to anything. What people most disliked was having their fatuities exposed; being found ridiculous. One should celebrate irreverence, and pay no respect to power.\" Inspirations Just William by Richmal Crompton \"All Shook Up\" by Elvis Presley Mafeking Road by Herman Charles Bosman The White Lady of the Brandenberg San cave painting in Namibia A Modest Proposal by Jonathan Swift"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
