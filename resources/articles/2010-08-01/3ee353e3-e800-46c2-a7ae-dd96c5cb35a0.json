The perfect storm of expanding population, global warming, toxic oceans, water shortages, desertification etc will probably overwhelm us over the next few decades, with little hope of effective counter-measures. Anyway, regarding colonisation of space, Joel E Cohen's terse comment in 1995 says it all: \"Let me dispense once and for all with extraterrestrial emigration. To achieve a reduction in the global population growth rate from, say, 1.6% to 1.5% would currently require the departure of 0.001 x 5.7 billion = 5.7 million astronauts in the first year and increasing numbers in each later year. To export this number of people would bankrupt the remaining Earthlings and would still leave a population that doubled every 46 years. Demographically speaking, space is not the place.\" Alec Ponton Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
