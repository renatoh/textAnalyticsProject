For example, quantum effects may allow European robins to navigate using magnetic fields and plants to photosynthesise. Guardian science correspondent Ian Sample talks to Karin Jensen of the Massachusetts General Hospital in the US about its research into the unconscious triggering of the placebo effect and its counterpart, the nocebo effect. The findings may lead to changes in the way healthcare is delivered. Alok and Ian are joined by Observer science editor Robin McKie to discuss some of this week's science news, including the near extinction of the Scottish wildcat and a proposed change in UK law that would enable research into treatments for defects in mitochondrial DNA.
