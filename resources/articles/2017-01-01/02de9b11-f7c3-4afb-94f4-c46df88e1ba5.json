Murray won a record fifth title at Queen\u2019s Club in 2016 and then Wimbledon for a second time three weeks later, before finishing the year as world No1. He was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year for a third time in December, and received a knighthood in the New Year honours list. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved playing the event and I\u2019m really happy to know that I will play at Queen\u2019s for as long as my career lasts,\u201d Murray said. \u201cMy first ATP World Tour match win came at Queen\u2019s in 2005, so for it to become by far the most successful tournament of my career is a great feeling. Looking at the names that have won the tournament four times \u2013 some of the best players ever \u2013 winning it five times means a lot to me.\u201d The BBC began broadcasting the tournament in 1979 and last year 3.7m people tuned in to watch Murray defeat Milos Raonic in the final. In 2017 the tournament is expanding its Centre Court capacity by 30%. More than 2,000 additional seats will be added to the current 6,942, taking the capacity above 9,000. Stephen Farrow, the Aegon Championships tournament director, said: \u201cTo know that Andy will play at the Queen\u2019s Club for the rest of his career and that the BBC will cover it every step of the way is a huge boost in what is an exciting and important year for the Aegon Championships with our stadium capacity increasing by 30%.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
