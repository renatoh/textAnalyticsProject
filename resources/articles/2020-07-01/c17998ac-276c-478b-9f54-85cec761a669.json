The Manchester United striker sustained a double stress fracture in an FA Cup win over Wolves that would have ended his season but for the sport\u2019s suspension in March. Rashford was able to resume playing when football restarted last month and he scored a 20th goal of the campaign in Saturday\u2019s 5-2 win over Bournemouth at Old Trafford. \u201cFirstly, I want to say how blessed I feel to be back healthy,\u201d the 22-year-old said. \u201cI\u2019ve had this injury before in the past but this time it was quite a bit worse than the ones I\u2019ve had before. It was definitely difficult news to hear.\u201d Rashford was pleased to score against Bournemouth. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a nice feeling to back scoring goals, but you know for forwards you just take it one game at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you score or you don\u2019t score, the next game is always about scoring. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll continue to do, like I\u2019ve done for the whole season, really, so game-by-game we want to win games and just keep competing for the trophies we\u2019re still in.\u201d United have won their last three league games and are unbeaten in 15 in all competitions. \u201cIn terms of importance, every game, single game for us now is important,\u201d Rashford said. \u201cWe want to go out and win every game. It\u2019s quite simple, really. And if we play like that, we\u2019ve got a good chance of doing that.\u201d Mason Greenwood scored twice against Bournemouth to take the 18-year-old\u2019s tally to 15. \u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic player,\u201d Rashford said. \u201cI\u2019ve watched him before he got to the first team \u2013 it was never a matter of if he was going to play with us, it was just when. When can we get him involved? \u201cOle [Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r] has done a terrific job with him. First of all, he put him in the squad and brought him on against PSG [in last season\u2019s Champions League last-16 win] and that for a player, as a first step, it\u2019s huge and it shows that the manager had confidence in him. You\u2019ve got no reason not to have confidence in a player like Mason. \u201cBut, for me, I just tell him to keep doing what he\u2019s doing because what he does is score goals, so he doesn\u2019t need to do anything else. You know, forget everything whatever people are doing outside, whether it\u2019s praise or negativity. \u201cHe\u2019s done very well for the whole season. It\u2019s not just these bits he\u2019s been scoring goals. He\u2019s been working hard for the team and doing the dirty work, you know the unseen work. He does it so he deserves all the credit that he gets.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r has no doubt Greenwood would also prosper should Gareth Southgate call him into the England squad. \u201cWhen you play for Man United, I think that\u2019s a test that\u2019s good enough and difficult enough,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIf you can handle playing for Man United, then you can handle playing for any team and Mason\u2019s got the qualities that not many others have. So he could play for England full team or Uunder-21s, I don\u2019t really mind. I know he\u2019s doing well for us and it\u2019s great to have him here.\u201d Greenwood made his Under-21s debut last year but is yet to be selected for the senior squad. Solskj\u00e6r was asked what impresses him most about Greenwood. \u201cMason\u2019s a naturally good finisher, so he\u2019ll always score goals,\u201d the Norwegian said. \u201cHe\u2019s a humble boy, he wants to learn, he listens, he\u2019s worked hard, you can see his fitness is getting better and better. He\u2019s just a young boy who will fill out, he\u2019s exciting to work with and we\u2019ll keep on building him up in the gym and on the pitch.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
