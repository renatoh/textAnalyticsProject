Shame he didn\u2019t show more imagination and suggest that I become a cryptozoologist, a calling I only came across last week. Dr Darren Naish, a cryptozoology expert, made the bold claim that smartphones have killed off the Loch Ness monster. Such is the ubiquity of these camera-enabled gizmos that the creature would have been photographed by now if it existed. \u201cYou would think that there would be better photos by now, but the ones we have are low-resolution blobs.\u201d Actually, Nessie doesn\u2019t exist, never has existed and was clearly just a cunning wheeze to lure tourists, so however good your phone camera, there never were going to be any snaps. Still, as cryptozoologists also ponder the existence of Bigfoot, the chupacabra (a blood-sucking South American creature of legend) and Mokele-mbembe (Congo\u2019s answer to Nessie), it\u2019s perhaps not that clever a career path. Moving swiftly along. I like nothing better than a good headline, as I\u2019ve said before, and here\u2019s a belter: \u201cIt\u2019s time to reimagine the marketing funnel.\u201d This was followed by an equally intriguing crosshead: \u201cHow the marketing funnel is failing B2B brands.\u201d Good stuff, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree, but somewhat opaque. Thank heaven for Google. The marketing funnel is \u201ca consumer focused marketing model which illustrates the theoretical customer journey towards the purchase of a product or service\u201d. Ah, if only my careers adviser had suggested that I go into marketing. I\u2019m sure I could have turned out such nuclear-strength codswallop and made squillions. \u2022Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
