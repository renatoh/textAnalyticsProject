Vella, a front-row forward, was treated for thyroid cancer last year but his doctors say he is in full remission. The 28-year-old is contracted to Parramatta for next year but has a clause in his contract allowing him to leave to play in the Super League. Terry Newton is the most notable omission from the Great Britain side taking on a Newcastle select side this morning. The Bradford hooker had been expected to start for the Lions when they play New Zealand in Christchurch on October 28 but his absence from today's game must put his participation next weekend in some doubt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
