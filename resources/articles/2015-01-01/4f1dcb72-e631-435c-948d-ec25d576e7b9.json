The Dane had opened the scoring with a superb first-half free-kick to give Spurs a 2-0 aggregate lead in the tie and they looked to be cruising to the Wembley final on 1 March. But goals on 77 and 79 minutes from Che Adams, an 18-year-old second-half substitute, looked like taking the sides into extra time before Eriksen\u2019s second of the night. \u201cSheffield United definitely gave us a big fight. They gained confidence after they scored their first goal, the second one was a bit lucky but we came back at the end,\u201d Eriksen said. \u201cThis season when we have been in front we have given stupid goals away and it is something we need to stop doing,\u201d he added, before saying the west London club will want to avenge the defeat at Spurs on 1 January. \u201cChelsea will probably want revenge in the final but I am really looking forward it.\u201d The manager, Mauricio Pochettino, admitted he was concerned when Adams scored twice in 140 seconds. \u201cFor sure, I was worried, it is football. Over the two legs we deserved to go to Wembley but you need to create chances, score and kill the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe gave the possibility to Sheffield and when they scored the second goal it was difficult. Football is emotion. Now we are happy for the players, they deserve the right to play at Wembley and for our supporters it is the most important goal.\u201d The meeting with Chelsea will be a rematch of the 2008 final, which Spurs won 2-1, the last time the north London club claimed a trophy. \u201cIt is my first final at Wembley, it is new to me and new to a lot of our players, but we will enjoy it,\u201d said Pochettino.\u201d Nigel Clough was a crestfallen but proud United manager. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that we didn\u2019t take it to extra time and everyone is down, to say the least. But the players can\u2019t give any more than they did and it wasn\u2019t quite enough,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just that bit of quality that made the difference tonight. Both of Eriksen\u2019s goals were superb.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
