The company, famed for its confectionery, plans to exploit the health benefits attributed to cocoa-components known as flavonols. These compounds have various biochemical effects expected to help in the prevention and treatment of conditions such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes. For reasons of patentability and commercial viability, Mars will need some years researching chemically altered versions of flavonols found naturally in chocolate. Rather than wait for the arrival of these synthetic derivatives, I thought I'd take a look at the benefits that eating flavonol-rich chocolate may offer us right now. Flavonols found in cocoa have, for instance, antioxidant activity, which means they can combat free radicals in the body. A food's capacity to neutralise free radicals may be expressed as its 'oxygen radical absorbance capacity' (orac). It turns out that, weight for weight, dark chocolate has an orac 10 times that of spinach, and about 15 times that of either broccoli or orange. The potent antioxidant action of flavonols could translate into considerable potential in terms of disease protection. Such laboratory-based research is interesting, but is perhaps not as relevant or useful as work which has focused on the effects that flavonol-rich chocolate have within the human body. One study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that eating dark chocolate each day for two weeks helped to reduce the blood pressure of those with high blood pressure. In another study, daily dark-chocolate consumption was found to lower cholesterol. Recent research published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition confirmed that dark-chocolate consumption can reduce blood pressure. This study also found other benefits for the body, namely an improvement in the ability of the hormone insulin to do its job. This would help in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Improvements in blood pressure and insulin sensitivity from chocolate eating may be related to cocoa's ability to boost the effectiveness of nitric oxide in the body. Those seeking maximum benefit from chocolate should opt for plain chocolate rather than milk varieties. While the daily amount of chocolate used in the research on dark chocolate has been considerable (typically 100g), these studies have been quite short in duration (around two weeks). It might be that regular, long-term consumption of smaller amounts of dark chocolate bring a box-full of health benefits for the body. Nutrition news Chromium is a mineral that is known to be particularly important for ensuring the efficient handling of sugar in the body Chromium is a mineral that is known to be particularly important for ensuring the efficient handling of sugar in the body. One effect of chromium is to help in the working of insulin - the chief hormone responsible for ensuring levels of sugar do not rise too high in the body. Problems with blood-sugar regulation and the inefficient working of insulin are believed to be an important underlying factor in heart disease. In a study published last month in the American Journal of Epidemiology, researchers assessed the relationship between body chromium levels (from toenail clippings) in a group of more than 1,300 men, about half of whom had had a heart attack. Chromium levels were found to be an average of 13 per cent lower in individuals who had had a heart attack. Also, men who had the highest levels of chromium in their bodies were found to be 35 per cent less likely to have a heart attack compared to those with the lowest chromium levels. Good dietary sources of chromium include egg yolk, beef, calf's liver and molasses. Those looking to supplement with this nutrient may get long-term benefits from dosages of 200-400 mcg per day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
