On receiving the award, frontperson Ellie Rowsell said: \u201cThis means so much to pick this up with my three best friends\u201d, while bassist Theo Ellis recalled how the band were knocked back by a record label head for their image, for Rowsell wearing makeup, and for their genre-resistant take on indie rock and post-punk, adding: \u201cBut here we are, so fuck you!\u201d Prior to the ceremony, Rowsell struggled to express how appreciative they were for the nomination: \u201cWe were so happy we got nominated. It\u2019s hard to show that. We\u2019re just gormless!\u201d At the show, the London four-piece performed their single Don\u2019t Delete the Kisses, twice \u2013 once during the show, and then shortly after to celebrate their win. Wolf Alice formed in 2010, initially as a duo comprised of Rowsell and guitarist Joff Oddie. Drummer Joel Amey and bassist Theo Ellis joined the band in 2012. They signed to the independent British label Dirty Hit, also home to the 1975, and in 2015 released their debut album My Love Is Cool, after building their profile through extensive touring. The album was nominated for the 2015 Mercury prize but lost to Benjamin Clementine. They have been commended for their genre-fluid approach to guitar music, incorporating elements of dream-pop and, on their blistering 2017 single Yuk Foo, hardcore punk. In 2017 they also starred in On the Road, a fictional romance film directed by Michael Winterbottom, set on a Wolf Alice tour. Rowsell was a judge for the prize in 2016. In a press conference following their win, she said that \u201cyou get given almost 300 albums to listen to ... and I feel privileged to have that insight, because I know the dedication and intensity it takes to come to that decision.\u201d Guitarist Joff Oddie said winning the prize was \u201cthe closest thing to an actual dream-like state \u2013 it sounds like such a cliche but that\u2019s what it felt like for me.\u201d Nadine Shah was the bookmakers\u2019 favourite to win for her third album, Holiday Destination, leading the jazz outfit Sons of Kemet and south London guitarist King Krule. Before the ceremony, Shah criticised what she perceived as the prize\u2019s creeping similarity to the more mainstream Brit awards. \u201cNow the Mercury is actually run by the same company, the BPI [British Phonographic Industry], I think it needs to find its feet again. It\u2019s controversial of me to say so, but I do criticise it for that. It needs to establish once again, what is it that they\u2019re trying to do. Why is Noel Gallagher being nominated? Why are there only two debut albums?\u201d She questioned the lack of women artists nominated for the prize, and expressed hope that one would win this year. For an independent artist like herself, she said, \u201cit gives me the opportunity to speak to more people and that\u2019s the most beautiful thing, that\u2019s what I wanna do with this album \u2013 speak to more people\u201d. Wolf Alice were presented with the \u00a325,000 prize at the Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith, London. Prior to the ceremony, the band described it as a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of money that would allow any band to record an album with high production values. Wolf Alice are the first female-fronted act to win the award since 2011, when PJ Harvey won for a second time with her eighth album, Let England Shake. The ceremony \u2013 at which most of the shortlisted artists performed \u2013 coincided with the publication of nominee Lily Allen\u2019s memoir, My Thoughts Exactly. The singer\u2019s publicist was holding a copy of the book, which has been the subject of tabloid intrigue, as Allen walked the red carpet and welcomed the recognition for her musical achievements. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s vindicating, but I do feel that my record label have been a little bit crap with promoting this record,\u201d she said. \u201cI dunno if you\u2019ve seen any posters or advertising. So it feels amazing that people that care about music have decided to put me in this list.\u201d She suggested that the revelations in her book \u2013 Allen\u2019s first \u2013 were responsible for the underwhelming effort on behalf of her label, Parlophone, and claimed it had received a copy of the finished memoir two weeks before she did. Albums by leading female solo artists have performed poorly in recent years: Allen\u2019s No Shame is no longer in the UK Top 100 albums; Florence + the Machine\u2019s High as Hope sits outside the Top 40. Allen suggested that this was due to male industry executives who felt threatened by the #MeToo movement wielding their power against women. \u201cThe music industry is rife with abuse and abuse of power, and the more power that women have the harder it is for the men to get away with the shit that they\u2019ve been getting away with forever,\u201d she said. The prize is decided on the night by a panel of judges, which this year consisted of musicians Ella Eyre, Jamie Cullum, Lianne La Havas and Marcus Mumford, broadcasters Clara Amfo, Danielle Perry and MistaJam, critics Harriet Gibsone (the Guardian), Will Hodgkinson (the Times) and Phil Alexander (Kerrang!/Mojo), plus radio industry figures: Jeff Smith, head of music at BBC 6 Music and Radio 2, and Radio X head of music Mike Walsh. Arctic Monkeys, winners in 2006 for their debut, were nominated for a fourth time for their sixth album, Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino. The band are in the midst of a residency in their home town of Sheffield, and did not attend the ceremony. The attention that comes with the Mercury prize traditionally drives sales and streams for the nominated artists. Winners Wolf Alice experienced one of the smaller increases in attention since nomination, their combined sales and streams rising just 3.9%. Jazz four-piece Sons of Kemet got the biggest commercial boost, with a 38.3% uplift; Florence + the Machine had the second biggest,32.8%; with Jorja Smith gaining 30.8%. The full list of this year\u2019s nominees was: Lily Allen, No Shame; Arctic Monkeys, Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino; Everything Everything, A Fever Dream; Everything Is Recorded, Everything Is Recorded; Florence + the Machine, High as Hope; Noel Gallagher\u2019s High Flying Birds, Who Built the Moon?; King Krule, The Ooz; Novelist, Novelist Guy; Nadine Shah, Holiday Destination; Jorja Smith, Lost and Found; Sons of Kemet, Your Queen is a Reptile; and Wolf Alice, Visions of a Life. Margot James, the government\u2019s creative industries minister, said: \u201cOnce again it\u2019s a strong and varied list of finalists, showing why the UK\u2019s music scene is one of our strongest calling cards. We are doing all we can to support the talent of tomorrow so the industry continues to grow and build on this country\u2019s rich musical history.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
