Sikora is almost certain to join this week for about \u00a33m from Vitesse Arnhem and Tigana hopes Djetou will follow, possibly on an initial season's loan. The Parma player is best known as a central defender but can also operate as a holding midfielder. Tigana coached Djetou at Monaco and failed in an attempt to bring him to Craven Cottage last summer, when he joined Parma. Fulham are hoping to complete a deal with the Serie A club this week. Ivory Coast-born Djetou, 27, has won a handful of France caps but did not make the World Cup squad. With Parma failing to qualify for Europe and their coach Cesare Prandelli looking to offload players, Tigana sees this as a perfect time to rekindle his interest. Sikora's arrival is designed to offer the width and goals from midfield that Fulham too often lacked last season. The 24-year-old is due in London to finalise personal terms and undergo a medical but no hitches are expected. Sikora had said he would prefer to join Ajax but discussions with Dutchmen in the Premiership, including Fulham's Edwin van der Sar, and Ajax's failure to meet Vitesse's demands appear to have changed the left-winger's mind. \"The English league is the best to play in,\" he insisted, and Ajax described their interest as \"finished\". Inamoto has joined on a one-year loan from Gamba Osaka, with an option for a further three years on a full transfer. The midfielder failed to feature in the league for Arsenal last season but impressed with Japan in the World Cup. Birmingham City's manager Steve Bruce is one signing away from completing his squad to meet the challenge of the Premiership after persuading the Ireland international Kenny Cunningham to join the club. The 31-year-old defender has decided to leave Wimbledon for St Andrews despite strong interest from Sunderland. The \u00a3500,000 deal, which depends on Cunningham passing a medical, means Bruce has one item left on his summer shopping list - a striker. Cunningham satisfies Bruce's need for a defender and Robbie Savage and Aliou Ciss\u00e9 have filled the two midfield vacancies. Bruce is now expected to resume talks with Crystal Palace this week about his long-time target, Clinton Morrison. Blues, who twice had \u00a35m bids for him rejected last season, want to include the striker Andrew Johnson as part of the deal, a move favoured by Palace's manager Trevor Francis. Chelsea have pulled out of their planned pre-season tour to Asia next week. The club said yesterday: \"As a result of a breach of contractual terms by Colours Asia Pacific Ltd, Chelsea will not be undertaking the proposed tour of Malaysia and China.\" Chelsea have organised a fixture against Oxford United on Wednesday next week instead and are hoping to arrange other friendlies in England. Meanwhile Peter Osgood has revealed he has been sacked from his public relations role at Chelsea after a \"personality clash\" with the chairman Ken Bates. \"All of a sudden Chelsea can't afford \u00a310,000 a year, which is a bit sad,\" the former Blues favourite said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
