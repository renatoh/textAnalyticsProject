Did a single viewer consider that his claim of vivid memories of pizza in Woking, but not a thing about Virginia Roberts-Giuffre \u2013 against whom he was photographed, pudgy fingers on her bare midriff, with his friend the alleged procuress Ghislaine Maxwell leering alongside \u2013 to be anything other than a further powerful reason to believe the survivor, not Prince Andrew? Giuffre has, after all, already settled a lawsuit against Ms Maxwell, who had accused her of lying. The royal family owes Princess Diana a posthumous apology: her Panorama appearance is now only the second most catastrophic, ill-advised royal broadcast ever made (unless that place rightfully goes to Charles\u2019s earlier confession of adultery). To our existing understanding of Andrew as an arrogant dolt, we can now \u2013 thanks to this uncovenanted example of reputation management \u2013 add the discovery that he believes that being a past patron of the NSPCC substitutes for giving a shit about Epstein\u2019s victims. And to think that this time last week royalists were agitating about the disrespectful portrayal of the monarch with \u201cPorchie\u201d in The Crown. Now \u2013 assuming she\u2019s heard the same excuses \u2013 the Queen is exposed as having protected the royal family\u2019s own, morally vacant, nemesis. The prince\u2019s rueful snigger alone, before \u201clet the side down\u201d, must have triggered a surge of collective nausea that the Queen, notwithstanding the new extra-empathetic generation of dependants, will struggle to subdue. Again, aside from the Giuffre allegations, the prince\u2019s frank focus on the convenience of the Epstein residence, as opposed to the fate of the girls and women who were raped inside it, would have confirmed that Princess Margaret was actually quite a minor case of royal entitlement syndrome. But perhaps we should blame ourselves? Andrew\u2019s generous Kazakh friends can\u2019t do everything. There was no room at the inn. Given a royal annexe in Fifth Avenue, this might never have happened. And media training seems to have been another incautious palace economy. If \u201cI have no recollection of ever meeting this lady\u201d does not follow him, like Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman\u201d, to his grave, it will only be because \u201cmy judgment was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable\u201d becomes the popular, go-to excuse for idiocy of all kinds, let alone the misfortune to remain the boon companion of a convicted child sex offender. It was hard to gauge, from the tackily suspenseful way the BBC has flourished its underage-sex-related scoop, how far the prince has been indulged. Maitlis was persistent, but never mentioned the time Andrew \u2013 according to Fergie \u2013 helped mediate a loan from Epstein. Nor did we discover, re the recurrent amnesia, if these blackouts are impacting his daily life, or if he can still count backwards from 100. There are questions, too, for the BBC. What is the excuse, given the seriousness of Giuffre\u2019s allegations, for the reverential set-up, for burnishing this pitiful, misogynistic nonsense with an audience in a massive gilded chamber, like a scene discarded from The King\u2019s Speech for looking too comically servile? For years, nobody heard Epstein\u2019s victims. The prince isn\u2019t the only one still indifferent to their feelings. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 and 19 November 2019 to: correct a description of Epstein\u2019s offending; and clarify that Prince Andrew is a past, not current, patron of NSPCC."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
