Can I just say I'd forgotten how much fun this is? The last week saw a huge number of entries for songs featuring dialogue, including a number of instrumentals, all of which were banned apart from one, as you'll see. My criteria \u2013 as maddeningly strict as strict can be \u2013 was that the song itself needed to be enriched by the dialogue within it. Chatter wouldn't cut it, however entertaining. So I was particularly stuck on Nilpferd's recommendation of My Bloody Valentine's I Only Said, which \"definitely contains dialogue\", but, it transpires, no one really knows what that dialogue might be. For me, that is the kind of questing spirit that makes this column what it is. The desire to share the music you love is so strong that fripperies like relevance to the topic will never, ever get in the way. What a wonderful thing pop music is. The B-list: Pixies \u2013 I've Been Tired It's one of those conversations we've all had at one time or another. \"And while we're at it, baby, why don't you tell me one of your biggest fears?\" He said, \"Losing my penis to a whore with disease\". As a side note, I'd like to add the woman asking the question has, \"breasts like a cluster of grapes\". The Everly Brothers \u2013 Ebony Eyes Total gorgeousness from 1961 with a classic slice of spoken word whacked in the middle. Man in the army sends for his girlfriend to join him for weekend wedding. She dies in plane crash en route. Hankie? The eyes are ready for you now. The Temptations \u2013 Hurry Tomorrow Don't waste your precious time watching endless drug-soaked Blaxploitation films from the early 70s, the perfectly realised dialogue at the start of this incredible track will tell you all about \"copping\" the \"bomb\". Nothing Better \u2013 The Postal Service While many songwriters have sweated over pain-wracked why-is-she-leaving-me? numbers over the years, few have had the good sense to include the other person's take on things. \"I've made charts and graphs that should finally make it clear,\" she says. \"I've prepared a lecture on why I have to leave.\" Great \u2013 thanks! Lynyrd Skynyrd \u2013 Gimme Three Steps Man with his \"hair coloured yellow\" meets a girl called Linda Lu at a place (I think it's safe to say it was a bar) called The Jug. Another, more physically imposing man walks in waving a gun. Linda, said man reveals, is \"his\" woman. Unpleasantness ensues. That's how it was in the 70s. Pigmeat Markham \u2013 Here Comes the Judge From 1968, and a startlingly clear forerunner of hip-hop, Markham's song is built around his courtroom stage routine. This has dialogue, jokes, buzz-phrases and more flowing from all sides. The Streets \u2013 Irony of It All Bullish, vomit-flecked lager lout verbally tackles PlayStation-toting student weed freak. Not the most subtle weapon in Mike Skinner's canon, but one of the most entertaining I, Ludicrous \u2013 Preposterous Tales Ken McKenzie is a beer-addled pub bore who's done it all and seen it all. He was on Crackerjack at the age of 10, once ate six Mars bars in half an hour, unearthed a bomb, even \"had a shower with two American girls\". It actually makes you want to spend more time pressed up against the bar. Eric Weissberg and Steve Mandell \u2013 Dueling Banjos You're right, there are no words in this whatsoever. But, if those bloody banjos aren't speaking to each other in their own sweet way, then we need to rethink the very idea of dialogue itself. Ella Fitzgerald and Sy Oliver \u2013 Don't Cha Go 'Way Mad This he-say, she-say smash from 1950 has Ella taking Sy to task after he was seen out with another woman. But, this being 1950, Ella forgives him within moments rather than emasculate him with a set of pruning shears. People \u2013 have we gone down the wrong path? This week's topic is all about celebrating youth cults that have inspired fear, awe and hilarity down through the ages. Jazzbos, trad-folkies, headbangers, punks, skins, grebos, ravers and emos. It's time for you all to stand up and make some noise. No passing references will be allowed (unless they're, y'know, wonderful), I'm after serious cultural consideration here. Your tools await: A-Z, archive, index and Spill. Collaborative playlist here. Thanks Spotify. No, really. Also, regulars may be interested to know the annual readers recommend social will take place on 18 July at the Union Tavern in London. Drink will be taken. Those wishing to attend should drop an email here forthwith."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
