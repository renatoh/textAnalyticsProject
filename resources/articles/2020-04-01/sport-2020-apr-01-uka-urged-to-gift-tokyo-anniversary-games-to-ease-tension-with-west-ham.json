Ed Warner, who led UK Athletics from 2007 to 2017, said his \u201cradical\u201d proposal would not only save millions of pounds that could be diverted towards fighting the Covid\u201119 pandemic, but would also be seen as a \u201cgift from London to sports fans around the world\u201d. The war of words between UKA and West Ham over what will happen to the London Stadium if the football season has resumed by July has become increasingly heated with West Ham rejecting calls from UKA\u2019s chief executive, Joanna Coates, to waive tenancy rights so the stadium can be reconfigured to stage the Anniversary Games on 4-5 July. While the contracts that UKA and West Ham hold with the London Legacy Development Corporation call for an element of \u201creasonableness\u201d, West Ham made clear this week that when the Premier League resumes the London Stadium will be configured for football \u201cand not inappropriately set up for an athletics meeting or a concert\u201d. With no solution to the impasse in sight, and UKA facing a crippling financial blow if its flagship event is not staged, Warner has urged both sides to think laterally and creatively and send a goodwill message to the Olympic host city that has seen its Games postponed for 12 months. \u201cThe ill-advised cost-saving exercise when the stadium was revamped after the London 2012 Games means that reconfiguring the seating takes around two weeks,\u201d Warner said. \u201cThis is a hugely labour-intensive exercise reported to cost up to a staggering \u00a38m a time, and social distancing guidelines militate against a nonessential project like the stadium seat move. \u201cNow, then, is the time for creativity. UKA, with the backing of the London mayor and DCMS [the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport], should offer the hosting rights for this year\u2019s Anniversary Games to Tokyo, free of charge. The Japanese capital would not be constrained by UKA\u2019s London Stadium calendar but could work with World Athletics to find a window in late summer or early autumn to stage a joyous two-day celebration of world-class athletics once, hopefully, the global pandemic has abated. \u201cTokyo should be encouraged to revert to the Anniversary Games\u2019 original structure and add a third day of elite Para athletics, so creating the tastiest of appetisers for both next year\u2019s Olympics and Paralympics.\u201d Warner, writing on the iSportConnect website, said he was convinced that the World Athletics president, Sebastian Coe, would recognise the value of the switch. He also believed the BBC, UKA\u2019s broadcast partner, would be delighted with an event likely to pull in an audience of \u201cmaybe five or 10 times its usual two million viewers\u201d, while M\u00fcller, the headline commercial partner, \u201cwould receive unimagined global exposure\u201d. \u201cThe Legacy Company would save the exorbitant costs of moving the London Stadium\u2019s seats, more than enough to make a payment equal to the average profit UKA made from the event in recent years,\u201d Warner said. \u201cThis would shore up the governing body\u2019s fragile finances and remove the virus uncertainty hanging over it. The mayor\u2019s remaining saving \u2013 perhaps as much as \u00a35m \u2013 could be committed to a fighting fund for community sports clubs in Newham and the other London Olympic boroughs to help them weather the effects of the pandemic. \u201cWest Ham, given a clear run at completing their season at home, should be encouraged to top up this fighting fund, or instead commit additional resources to the excellent community work already undertaken by the club\u2019s charitable foundation.\u201d Warner said that such an event would also help Tokyo prepare for next summer\u2019s Olympics. \u201cA two- or three-day Diamond League event in its shiny new National Stadium would prove the hottest ticket anywhere in the world this year and a guaranteed money-spinner. Has there ever been a better test event for an Olympic venue?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
