Fury beat Klitschko in 2015 but has since taken time out from the sport after having tested positive for cocaine use. That means the WBA heavyweight title which Fury won from the Ukrainian is on the line when Klitschko and Joshua meet in London next week, and Joshua believes it should have been Fury he was fighting instead. \u201cI think Tyson Fury is the biggest fight for me,\u201d Joshua said from his training camp in Sheffield. \u201cIf it were up to me, that would have been the fight happening this summer. That\u2019s what I thought. I was planning for a massive showdown with Tyson Fury, but he had other plans and I just had to carry on. When he returns, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll still be here.\u201d Joshua and Fury sparred this week on Twitter, the Mancunian mocking Joshua\u2019s muscular physique and labelling him \u201ca poor man\u2019s Frank Bruno\u201d. Joshua responded by offering Fury two tickets for the Klitschko fight, adding \u201cdon\u2019t bring a plus one, it\u2019s for your fat ass\u201d. \u201cTwitter is about communication and it\u2019s just communicating,\u201d Joshua said of the spat. \u201cHe addresses me and tweets me quite often and I was just in the frame of mind where I thought me and Klitschko don\u2019t have much verbals, so let me respond to Fury.\u201d As for the Bruno jibe, Joshua said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite disrespectful. If he\u2019s an all-time great then why is he worrying about who is behind him? You should focus on your future. I must be so relevant to the people that are in front of me. I just find it so disrespectful. He calls himself the greatest of all time, the GOAT. If I was the GOAT I would never worry about who is behind me. I\u2019m leading the way.\u201d Joshua faces Klitschko for the WBA, IBO and IBF heavyweight titles at Wembley Stadium on 29 April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
