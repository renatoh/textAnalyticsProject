It's the story of a woman and her two daughters, and the female community that both nurtures and imprisons them on the Tunisian island of Djerba. Rabia Ben Abdallah is superb as Aicha, a woman who is married to a businessman away in Tunis and must live in a kind of purdah with all his sisters-in-law on the island. He and the other menfolk come to live with them for just one month a year - the \"season of men\". With a wonderfully fluent gift for storytelling, Tlatli interleaves the past and present as naturally as the verses of a song, with a narrative mastery that she makes look easy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
