If you are an Australian woman around the age of 45, you almost certainly know who Alison Brahe is. The blonde, sunny beauty appeared on the cover of Dolly dozens of times in the early 1990s. She was the pinup girl of mainstream white Australian style in that era, a sort of Elle-Macpherson-next-door whose wholesome good looks seemed almost attainable if you went for enough runs on the beach and faithfully reapplied your apricot Body Shop lip balm. Even today she still invites delighted comments and cries of recognition from the women who once Blu-Tacked her to their Laura Ashley-wallpapered bedroom walls. And like those former teenagers, Brahe has grown up. \u201cWe think of her as a 20-year-old but she\u2019s 50 and going through menopause just like the rest of us,\u201d says Tonic co-founder and Dolly editor during the Brahe years, Marina Go. That makes her a poignant visual link between the two eras \u2013 from the teenage girls who were learning about periods and breasts and \u201cdo I smell normal down there?\u201d who Dolly spoke to in the 1990s, to those same women who are dealing with the hormonal upheaval of menopause today. These are the women Go and her team hope to reach with Tonic. It was conversations with her friends and former colleagues around menopause in particular, that made Go \u2013 who\u2019s 54 and has two adult sons with journalist husband Graeme Pringle \u2013 realise there were no obvious media brands speaking directly to women at their stage of life. She and her former Dolly colleagues, including Megan Morton (then: Dolly Club founder and editorial coordinator; now: interiors stylist), Carlotta Moye (then: fashion editor; now: photographer) and Ute Junker (then: subeditor; now: writer, editor and podcaster), would regularly meet for coffees and dinners and discuss what their lives looked like in their 40s and 50s \u2013 caring for elderly parents, seeing adult children leave home (or not), talking about relationships and of course, menopause. \u201c[Menopause] is \u2013 for a lot of us \u2013 quite a severe hormonal change,\u201d Go says, with a Dolly-esque matter-of-factness. \u201cIt\u2019s quite confronting. And many of us were saying that the last time most of us felt this lost was when we were teenagers getting our periods.\u201d \u201cThen one day we realised, the reason we\u2019re having these conversations is that there\u2019s no good information out there. Back in the good old days, as a teenager, there was Dolly. As you work through other stages of your life there are magazines for those times. But there aren\u2019t magazines aimed at this life stage. \u201cSo we felt there was this huge opportunity to help, and engage with these women going through this hormonal change, who we were there for 30 years ago with Dolly. Because effectively it\u2019s the same group of women.\u201d After eight Covid-19 lockdown-inspired weeks, Tonic launched on 8 June, staffed by nine former Dolly staff members including Go. Its content \u2013 with titles such as Yes You Can Still Grow Your Super At 50 and My Life, My Closet \u2013 is a familiar magazine-y mix of real-life stories, fashion, health and finance with a deliberate tilt towards women who are no longer interested in getting the latest hairstyle or knowing what band is touring, but instead about how to feel more settled in the skin and the life they already know so well. The revolutionary medical advice page Dolly Doctor has also made a reappearance, this time as Tonic Doctor, which launched with a look at natural remedies for menopause. Dolly Doctor was an unprecedented phenomenon in its heyday, answering teenage girls\u2019 questions about boys, body changes and growing up in ways the reader was unlikely to find anywhere else, unless she had a very open-minded and unabashed mother or big sister. Go, who edited Dolly for five years from 1989, taking over when she was just 23 years old, took her role as an authoritative voice for teenagers extremely seriously. And Dolly readers flooded the magazine\u2019s offices with pleas for help. \u201cI read every single letter that came into the magazine,\u201d Go says. \u201cWe\u2019d get around 500 letters a month just for Dolly Doctor.\u201d But internet killed the magazine star, and the print edition of Dolly \u2013 and with it, Dolly Doctor \u2013 was axed by its final custodians, German publishing house Bauer Media, in 2016. Today teenage girls can find information about periods and pubic hair in almost every corner of the internet, and the urgency of waiting for the latest issue of Dolly to find out whether or not your breasts are the wrong shape or if masturbation will send you blind has been long lost. And realistically, women of menopausal age can also find plenty of authoritative information about health issues in thousands of corners of the internet too, as well as content of a similar style to that which Tonic promises. It could seem like a huge leap of faith to be starting yet another women\u2019s media brand in an era when many legacy women\u2019s titles are disappearing \u2013 Harpers Bazaar, Elle and InStyle all vanished from shelves in 2020 along with News Corp\u2019s digital women\u2019s publication, Whimn, which pressed send on its final article earlier this month. Wendy Harmer\u2019s news and opinion website the Hoopla, which targeted a similar demographic to Tonic, folded in 2015 after four years of publishing, and the mass-market women\u2019s print tabloid Yours \u2013 a Dolly stablemate \u2013 which aimed to reach women over 55 \u2013 shut up shop three years after its launch in 2014. But Go feels that she and her team\u2019s long experience connecting deeply with women at a very specific life stage puts her ahead of the curve. She\u2019s not interested, she says, in chasing clicks or sensationalism in the way that the more mass-market women\u2019s publications do. Instead, she wants to give women her age the same soft place to land that she gave them with Dolly three decades ago when they were just beginning to find their way in the world \u2013 even if that content doesn\u2019t always hit the precious holy grail of virality that tends to power almost everything online. \u201cWe got a comment early on from a woman who said \u2018[Tonic feels like] you\u2019re sitting at the dining table with me and my girlfriends,\u2019\u201d Go says. \u201cThat felt absolutely wonderful.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not about being sexy or needing clicks. We\u2019re about wrapping our arms around these women and giving them a sense of safety and belonging.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
