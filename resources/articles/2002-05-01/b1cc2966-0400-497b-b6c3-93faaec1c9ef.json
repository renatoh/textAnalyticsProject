He's tried, of course. That's Nic we're talking about, not Lenny - stuffing your pants with Andrex and wearing a wig doesn't constitute effort in the Fiver's book. But God knows Lonely Nic has tried. Since arriving at Anfield, he's made all the right noises: repeatedly insisting he was content (and when his Radiohead/Smiths mix tape was blaring through his Walkman, you almost believed him); lowering his \u00a365,000-a-week pay demands; and occasionally even offering a smile. Still, it did him no good. Today, Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier turned down the chance to sign him for \u00a312m. \"After a lot of thought we've decided not to make Nicolas Anelka's move from Paris St-Germain a permanent one,\" a rather heartless club statement said. \"This was a difficult decision and we know that Nicolas will be very disappointed, but the manager has always had to do what he thinks is best for the club and the development of the team.\" There was no mention made of Anelka's surly attitude (which must be a first for any story about the Frenchman), nor his miserly return of five goals in his 23 games for Liverpool. And nothing either about who could replace him. But do the maths: Freddie Kanoute is not worth the \u00a310m West Ham are demanding, while Auxerre's Djbril Cisse looks a bargain at \u00a315m. What's more, Cisse recently admitted: \"English football would suit my style and I have a slight preference for Liverpool.\" Yes, we've worked it out too. * * * * * * * * * * * * YOU'RE SYLVAIN You've got to hand it to Kelvin Koogan. The Fiver isn't quite sure what that \"it\" is (maybe a big wig, a baseball bat, or Gareth Southgate in a sweeping role), but it's bound to have something to do with a load of cash. King Koog has already spent \u00a312.5m at Maine Road in the last three months, \u00a34m of which was splashed out today on Paris St Germain's erstwhile Newcastle defender Sylvain Distin. And according to Newcastle, Koog will have to find a little more cash still if he's going to keep Distin happy. \"Distin has turned his back on the elite European competition and the reason is purely mercenary,\" said morally upstanding Newcastle chairman Freddie Shepherd today after Sylv had become a Citizen. The French defender had been on loan at the Toon, and they claim to have had first refusal on buying him. But yet City got their man, much to Shepherd's annoyance. \"We agreed a fee with PSG and the agreement was that we had first refusal on him,\" Shepherd said. \"We were aware that one or two clubs had been alerted to his ability and were prepared to pay silly money to lure him away from Newcastle. That's when his agent got involved. We made him a very generous offer, but we weren't going to be held to ransom.\" All of which suggests that instead it was Kanny Koogan who was bundled into a metaphorical basement and bound with gaffer tape to an allegorical radiator. However, City's director of football Dennis Tueart insists that City have done good. \"When it became clear that Newcastle were not going to take up their option on the player Kevin moved very quickly,\" he said. \"Sylvain is a powerful, quick athlete who has already proved himself at the highest level. We are delighted to have him on board.\" Anyone got a number for a good lawyer? * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I hope we can give England a wake-up call, but I know they have a very experienced coach and the players are very experienced. The attitude of English professionals is that they will go for it. I don't expect a Sunday afternoon walking game\" - Ahead of a friendly with England tomorrow, South Korea coach Guus Hiddink hints at the game that fat football fans have been waiting for. * * * * * * * * * * * * SCOTLAND'S SCOTLAND HELL Following the Scottish national football team has always been a hellish misery. But apart from the six minutes it took to sit through both sides of BA Robertson's official 1982 World Cup single We Have A Dream (b/w Wrap Up The Cup We're Going To Take It Away), things have never been as painful as this. Today, hapless new manager Berti Vogts further rehabilitated the reputations of Andy Roxburgh and Craig Brown by becoming the first Scotland manager to lose all of his first four matches in charge. No, we can't believe it's never happened before either. This time it was the South Africans who made Wee Berti's men suffer. Tebogo Makoena put the World Cup qualifiers ahead midway through the first half of their pre-World Cup friendly in Hong Kong, before George Koumantarakis put a seal on the result with a minute to play. But amongst the Scottish gloom there is a chink of light. You'll note that the Scots only let in two goals, which is quite good. And not only that, they also hit the bar through Kevin Kyle, Sunderland's second-poorest international player with the initials KK. \"I am very optimistic,\" said Vogts, who was hosting a positive thinking seminar entitled Berti's Bright Side: Suicide Nein, Stockdale Ja. \"In the defending part we did well and now we have a lot of alternatives for the squad list,\" he continued, his muffled voice just audible from the layers of sand covering his head. Little Berti then bigged up his new strike pairing of Kyle and Scott Dobie: \"They did well, especially Kevin Kyle. Dobie is a different style of striker and that is good.\" So can this mould-breaking front line help to break Scotland's run of defeats in their next game, a kickabout against the Hong Kong League XI? Let's hope so, because no living Scotsman would deserve to suffer five losses in a row. Not even BA Robertson. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Liverpool are planning a \u00a331.5m bid for Portuguese international Manuel Rui Costa. The Italian sports daily also reckons Roma's Gabriel Batistuta is on his way to Chelsea, with Eidur Gudjohnsen going the other way. A Juventus delegation is ready to go to Manchester United to agree a deal for Lilian Thuram. The Turin-based paper says United might propose an exchange involving Juan Sebastian Veron - but Juve want the money, which they'll use to buy either Alessandro Nesta or Fabio Cannavaro. Meanwhile, Barcelona are prepared to pay \u00a330m for Veron. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Germany midfielder Sebastian Deisler has been ruled out of the World Cup finals with a knee injury. Former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar has put himself forward for the vacant manager's job at Brighton. \"If the job comes up I'll sit down and think about it,\" Grobbelaar said from his home in South Africa. \"I've put my CV in at Stoke City, Rotherham and Brighton,\" he said. Middlesbrough are seeking \u00a37m damages following Christian Ziege's controversial move to Liverpool, it was announced in the High Court. The Anfield club are being sued after being fined \u00a320,000 by a Premier League inquiry. Ziege was also fined \u00a310,000 after the inquiry found there had been breaches of the league's rules prohibiting poaching of contracted players. FA suit Adam Crozier believes Kelvin Koogan's shock decision to resign as England coach risked the country's World Cup hopes. \"Quitting after Germany left us completely rudderless for the trip to Helsinki,\" Crozier said in the Sun. \"I felt it was very brave of him to say: 'I don't think I'm up to the job'. The thing I didn't agree with him over was the timing. My view was if that was the way he felt the time to go was after the game in Finland, four days later.\" Leeds United rent-a-quote chairman Peter Ridsdale revealed Robby Bobson was the FA's first choice to take over from Kelvin Koogan as England manager. \"Everybody agreed that the ideal was an Englishman with another young Englishman backing him up,\" the Sun reports Ridsdale said in a biography of Eriksson. \"We had Bobby Robson and Peter Taylor as manager and heir apparent. There was a long debate about whether Terry Venables should be considered and everybody agreed that if New England was to represent what the FA wanted it to stand for, we couldn't discount Terry's non-footballing reputation.\" Rangers have revealed that talks are planned with the Scottish and English FAs to discuss an Old Firm move to the English Football League. \"We will now sit down with the SPL, the SFA, the English FA and the Nationwide League to work out what is the best way forward for the game throughout the whole of the UK,\" said Rangers commercial director Martin Bain. The Professional Footballers' Association have responded positively after talks with Bradford's administrators. \"The talks were fruitful, there was no animosity between us,\" said PFA assistant chief executive Mick McGuire. \"Every administrator's stance when it comes to cutting costs is to target player's contracts. We made it clear to them where we are coming from and that we expect all contracts to be upheld.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO Channel 5: England Under-21 v Italy Under-21 - live (7.15pm) Other Birt ideas to improve our transport system: Under-21 Championship Report (12.50am) More hovercrafts in inner-cities.
