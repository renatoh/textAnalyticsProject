She\u2019s safe inside, somewhere on a Massachusetts peninsula, and it\u2019s one of those days, she says, when she could happily be drinking a Guinness while the rain lashes down. She is newly engaged, has a book coming out, and \u201clife is lovely\u201d. When life was a little less lovely, the actor and standup comedian embarked on writing Little Weirds, her new collection of ... how to describe them exactly? The assorted pieces aren\u2019t essays, nor short stories; perhaps they are best categorised as amused musings on the things that animate her. The book\u2019s catalyst was multi-pronged. She endured \u201cpummelling heartbreak\u201d at the end of a relationship. When Donald Trump became US president in 2016, she felt exhausted, disempowered and \u201castounding loneliness\u201d. In the introduction she calls the book \u201ca weird party for a woman who has returned from grief\u201d. She started to write the pieces privately as a way of voicing how she felt when Trump\u2019s rhetoric became increasingly disturbing to her. In the face of near-paralysing powerlessness, she was finding her voice. \u201cWhat I say changes my experience,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is important to start on that personal level.\u201d She has a process as a performer, she says, but writing this book involved having no expectations as to how it should be completed. A restless and distracted person, she tried to impose order on herself with early starts but ended up writing most of the book in bed at night, looking at the ocean. She would fall asleep at 4am and wake at 11. Standups turning to prose often struggle with the fact that they can\u2019t hear laughter at the end of their sentences. For Slate \u2013 who was a cast member on Saturday Night Live, has performed comedy for more than 15 years, and who has a new Netflix special \u2013 standup material doesn\u2019t live until it evokes a reaction. One of the surprises was that despite this, the writing came pouring out of her. \u201cI was so shocked that I was able to express what I wanted to at all,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching someone just throw a bunch of spices into a pot and somehow they know what they\u2019re doing. And I don\u2019t know if that will ever happen again.\u201d Slate is open in conversation, and makes herself even more vulnerable on the page. The book is about her place in the world, the word \u201cI\u201d appearing more frequently than in any other book that I\u2019ve encountered. \u201cI wrote this book to truly soothe and please myself, as if I were the only one who would ever read it.\u201d Writing it, she says at the beginning of the book, she hoped to put herself back together. Gradually, she found, she could. \u201cFor me it was wonderful to put myself back together but it was even more important to realise that to be alive is to be in flux.\u201d Even the pieces more obviously grounded in reality (in Trench-Times/Dream Dog she writes, \u201cOne man was gone from my life just about the time that another man pig-snorted his way into the presidency\u201d) aren\u2019t written with the coruscating honesty that characterises a lot of personal essays; her prose is much more poetic than journalistic. She often writes in abstract terms: \u201cI was inclined to throw away my joy,\u201d or, \u201cThe only thing left was the number zero.\u201d This isn\u2019t unlike how Slate talks: \u201cI think I have a more lyrical way of speaking than I noticed,\u201d she says. She doesn\u2019t think that she tries to make people laugh in conversation, though she she did when she was younger. Many of the pieces are funny but, for the most part, comedy is not their goal. What is unusual about Little Weirds, however, is that it is a book in which lines such as: \u201cI will gulp clear water that used to have bugs and poop and poison in it but has been cleaned up so that it doesn\u2019t make us blow chunks\u201d can coexist with others such as: \u201cI died after living more of my life with you than I lived with just myself.\u201d It was a conscious decision to fill the book with lyrical language instead of harsh rhetoric. At some point during Trump\u2019s presidency, Slate thought: \u201cFor every bit of garbage that this predator is going to spew into the zeitgeist, I\u2019m going to write something beautiful and true about myself or for myself or about my life or for anybody else who wants to listen.\u201d She compares the administration to a bunch of 15-year-olds arguing with each other, and she is frightened not only about the impact that language can have but also \u201chow quickly we can forget to use it in a dignified way\u201d. The opposition to Trump can be waged on numerous fronts, she thinks \u2013 one of which is the reclamation of gentle, thoughtful, beautiful expression. \u201cI think we can be discouraged from speaking in tones that are more comforting or are more aesthetically pleasing because we\u2019re being lured into combat all the time,\u201d she says. Slate\u2019s confident and articulate voice belies a personal insecurity. She is a Hollywood movie star who didn\u2019t go to acting school because she thought that if someone commented negatively on her, she wouldn\u2019t have the confidence to keep going. She still suffers from stage fright and though hypnosis has given her coping mechanisms, she thinks it will remain. She likens its effects \u2013 forgetting her lines, her throat closing up \u2013 to someone tying themselves to a chair so that they cannot physically get on to the stage. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I envision the people not laughing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s that I envision them being angry with me. That\u2019s a very hurtful image to have in my mind. Man, it\u2019s scary.\u201d Where does she think that comes from? \u201cFrom being bullied at middle school. It comes from the feeling that, as a child, perhaps I was a burden. It comes from the question of whether or not I\u2019m lovable. It comes with me, and I wish that I didn\u2019t have it.\u201d As for how she feels as Little Weirds is about to be received by the wider world, she is sanguine. She neither reads bad reviews nor searches for her name online. She leads a relatively peaceful life, out by the water. And besides, her opinion is the one that matters most to her. \u201cI stand by my work,\u201d she says. \u201cI love it.\u201d \u2022 Little Weirds is published on 7 November by Little, Brown."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
