Ofcom also announced that it will launch an investigation into the price of text messages next year and could start regulating prices, something that is already being done in other European markets, in 2009. In a move likely to reduce the cost of mobile calls for everyone, the telecoms watchdog has proposed extending the current caps on the price that mobile phone networks can charge each other, and fixed line operators like BT, to speak to their customers. Known as wholesale termination rates, these prices are the basis of the call charges that consumers see on their bills. The current regulatory regime, which saw prices come down by 30%, runs out next year and Ofcom has proposed extending it to 2011. The regulator is also scrapping the historical difference between the prices that T-Mobile and Orange can charge compared with those of O2 and Vodafone. It is also bringing calls made over 3G networks into the regulatory regime for the first time since licences to run new high speed mobile networks were sold by the government at the height of the dot.com boom. By 2011 the wholesale rates that Orange and T-Mobile can charge will be 5.3 pence per minute compared with 6.31p at present, while the prices charged by Vodafone and O2 will reduce from 5.63p to 5.3p. These price cuts are likely to flow through to consumers. Yesterday the four main networks were generally sanguine about the proposed cuts. But for the first time the price charged by 3 will also be capped, making it cheaper for people to call 3 customers from other networks or landline phones. The company, owned by Hong Kong-based conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, will see its wholesale termination rate reduced to 6 pence per minute, a cut of over 30%. Ofcom is able to regulate 3's prices after ruling that the company has significant market power. When Ofcom originally made this determination, 3 challenged the regulator before the Competition Appeal Tribunal and won. The tribunal demanded that Ofcom revisit its ruling and yesterday the regulator reiterated that it believes 3's prices should be regulated. The mobile phone company, however, is currently consulting with its lawyers and is understood to be considering yet another appeal against Ofcom's ruling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
