Flying from Luton Airport this summer to nine destinations across Europe, the airline said it will provide 'honesty and transparency' in its pricing, as the first in a 'second generation' of low-cost airlines that take the whole package seriously - not just the cost. There will be no in-flight meals, but seats will be allocated on booking. Albert Churchman, Now's chief financial officer, said: 'There is absolute clarity about how much you pay and we're definitely going to be cheaper [than other low-cost airlines] in the last few months before flying.' A spokeswoman for Easyjet, which sells on the classic 'low-cost airline' structure of prices increasing as take-off approaches, said: 'There is the opportunity to get much cheaper seats with us if you are flexible.' Easyjet has flights from Stansted to Rome starting at \u00a346 return, including taxes, increasing to \u00a3250 for last- minute bookings. Now's flights to Rome from Luton will be fixed at \u00a3120 - whenever they are booked. Welcoming the new airline, a spokesman for the Air Transport Users Council said: 'Lead-in prices with the low-cost airlines are there to suck in customers and there are often very few seats at the advertised price which can be confusing. Now's pricing sounds transparent, which is great for the consumer.' \u00b7 Now will fly from Luton to Manchester (\u00a340), Jersey (\u00a345), Hamburg and Dusseldorf (\u00a350), Ibiza, Rome and Valencia (\u00a360), Lisbon (\u00a370), and Tenerife (\u00a380). All prices are for one-way travel, including taxes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
