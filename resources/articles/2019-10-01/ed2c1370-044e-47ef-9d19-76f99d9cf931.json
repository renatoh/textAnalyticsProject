Speaking on Saturday morning, Torra again condemned the violence of recent days, adding: \u201cViolence has never been our flag.\u201d He urged talks with Spain\u2019s acting government \u201cto open a dialogue to find a democratic solution and a political and democratic\u201d way out of the crisis over regional independence. The pro-independence regional president has been criticised for his delay in condemning the violence \u2013 and for calling for civil disobedience before sending police forces in to quell it. His call for talks came two days after he suggested another unilateral independence referendum should be held in response to the imprisonment of nine leaders over their roles in the failed push for secession two years ago. After five consecutive nights of violence in Barcelona, there was a noisy standoff on Saturday night lasting several hours when a large group of peaceful and largely middle-aged protestors sat down in front of a line of riot police vans to prevent younger protestors from attacking the police. Behind them, hundreds of young people, many with their faces covered, milled around, waiting for the peaceful protesters to disperse, while others set up barricades and taunted police on the other side of the square. Police fired rubber bullets to disperse protesters. There was an exceptionally heavy police presence on all the streets leading to Pla\u00e7a d\u2019Urquinaona, the focus of the worst of Friday night\u2019s violence. In the north of the city, protesters set fire to barricades on Avinguda Meridiana, one of the main roads leading into the city. Meanwhile, in Madrid, police baton-charged groups of demonstrators in the city centre who were protesting against the sentences handed out to the Catalan leaders. In other developments Ada Colau, the mayor of Barcelona, and Roger Torrent, the president of the Catalan parliament, on Saturday formed an alliance with trade union and other groups to create a \u201cworkspace\u201d against violence and the Spanish government\u2019s insistence on using legal measures to deal with the Catalan issue. No one from the Catalan government took part in the group\u2019s first meeting. Friday\u2019s violence in Barcelona was centred on the headquarters of the national police force on Via Laietana. Black smoke rose above the city as protesters set fire to rubbish bins and a newspaper kiosk. Thousands gathered in the surrounding streets chanting: \u201cThe streets will always be ours!\u201d Police struggled to control the situation, firing rubber bullets, teargas and, later in the night, a water cannon was deployed against demonstrators for the first time since it was bought from Israel in 1994. Officers from both national and regional forces have been criticised for their heavy-handed actions and a journalist from El Pa\u00eds was arrested while covering Friday\u2019s skirmishes. Other members of the Spanish media have been intimidated and targeted by some independence supporters. The city council says the violence this week has cost the city more than \u20ac2m (\u00a31.7m) \u2013 much of it lost by the burning of more than 1,000 rubbish bins. Many Barcelona residents woke up on Saturday to find there was no where to put their garbage. Hundreds of council workers were on the streets on Saturday trying to clean up from the previous night. Spain\u2019s interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, travelled to Barcelona on Saturday to meet his Catalan counterpart and to visit national police officers injured in Friday\u2019s violence. The march that had preceded the unrest had been overwhelmingly peaceful. According to Barcelona police, about 525,000 people congregated in the city, many of them having marched there from around Catalonia. A radical movement of young Catalan separatists, Arran, has called for a new demonstration \u201cagainst repression\u201d in central Barcelona on Saturday afternoon. Spain\u2019s government has promised a firm, united and proportionate response to the violence but has said it will not fall into the trap of further inflaming tensions. \u201cThe only hope of those violent groups is that we\u2019ll make mistakes and become overexcited and divided,\u201d the acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said on Wednesday. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s caretaker government has already said it could activate article 155 of the constitution, which would allow it to suspend the regional government and assume direct rule of the region. The socialist prime minister\u2019s rightwing opponents are calling for the government to take a hard line on the latest eruption of the regional independence crisis. Spain is due to hold its fourth general election in as many years on 10 November. Although S\u00e1nchez has taken a more conciliatory approach to the Catalan question than his predecessor, he has ruled out any referendum on Catalan independence and insisted any negotiations will have to respect the Spanish constitution, which stresses the \u201cindissoluble unity\u201d of the country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
