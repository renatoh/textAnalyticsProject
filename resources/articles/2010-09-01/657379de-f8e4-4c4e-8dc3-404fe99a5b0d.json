The best in the world consistently medal at the biggest events but it's not the type of sport where someone wins every event that they're in, because there are so many people to fight, so many rounds to go through, so many variables that can affect the match. It's like playing a game of a chess but someone's trying to beat you round the head and expects you to make your chess move at the same time.

Over the past year I've been the most consistent I've been in my career. I'm winning medals at the very biggest events, so I hope that will culminate in standing on top of the podium in 2012. I've never been world champion so trying to earn that next year is a big part of my preparation.

I'm not the most explosive guy but to become more so takes a long time and the advantage minimal. Instead, day-in day-out I'm trying to come up with technical answers to problems I face and keep pushing on conditioning.\" Key statistics Major honours won European Championship bronze 2005, 07, 10 World Championship bronze 2007, 10 Oympic record Beijing 2008, 7th 2009 record IJF Grand Slam Tokyo gold; GB World Cup B'ham gold 2010 record World and European Championship bronze World rankings to 6 Sep 2010 1 Kim J-bum (Kor) 2 I Nifontov (Rus) 3 L Guilheiro (Br) 4 Song Dae-nam (Kor) 5 E Burton (GB) Main 2012 rivals Kim Jae-bum 2010 world ch'ship gold; Beijing silver Ivan Nifontov 2010 world ch'ship n/a; Beijing n/a Olympic countdown 10-12 Dec 2010 Grand Slam Tokyo, Japan 5-6 Feb 2011 Grand Slam Paris, France 26-27 May 2011 Grand Slam Moscow, Russia 18-19 Jun 2011 Grand Slam Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 23-28 Aug 2011 World Judo Championships Paris, France 9-11 Dec 2011 Grand Slam Tokyo, Japan Jan 2012 onwards Three slam events in run-up to London 2012 all dates still to be confirmed; the International Judo Federation has yet to determine the 2012 schedule for the European Championships In numbers 2 Number of bronze medals available to win in each weight category within Olympic judo 14 Overall number of judo entries, the maximum possible, that Great Britain have been allocated for London 2012 3 Number of medals Great Britain's judo team are looking to win in London.
