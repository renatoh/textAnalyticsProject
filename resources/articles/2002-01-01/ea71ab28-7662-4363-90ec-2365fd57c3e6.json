Paul Theroux's The Happy Isles of Oceania did nothing to help the 'dull' tag, with the author - in the midst of a marital break-up and cancer scare - appearing to take agin the country from the first 'Welcome to Na Zillun'. Lots of beards and walking socks, he huffs. 'They carried string bags. They shopped in places with names like Clark's General Drapers and Edwin Mouldey Ironmongery. It was the indoor suburban culture of the seaside suburbs of 1950s England, Bexhill-on-the-Pacific...' Now another fluffy creature - the Hobbit - is putting the islands in the international spotlight and tourist authorities are seizing the opportunity to show off the nation's scenic and cosmopolitan wares. The 'Middle Earth' landscapes in the recently released first instalment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy have garnered almost as much column-space as the film's cast or special effects. These are islands where the earth still spits boiling water and mud, with the volcanic plateau in the central North Island becoming Tolkien's fiery Mt Doom, peaceful pastoral Matamata in a starring role as Hobbiton and the majestic fjords of the deep South standing in for the Misty Mountains. As well as medieval-style backdrops, New Zealand provided hip hangouts and thrills aplenty for the international cast that included Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins, Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf), Liv Tyler (Arwen) and Cate Blanchett (Elf Queen Galadriel) during over a year's filming. The capital Wellington was the site of director Peter Jackson's studios and several locations: a Hobbit encampment sprang up at one stage at the end of my parents' street and a fantasy castle could be seen overlooking the motorway. Returning to tread the red carpet laid along Wellington's Courtenay Place for the Australasian premiere, Wood announced, was 'like coming home'. The city claims more restaurants and caf\u00e9s per capita than New York and Wood, along with a merry band of Hobbits and members of the fellowship, had become a well-known face in several of them, with Brava, Motel and The Matterhorn particular favourites. Offering cocktails, wine and boutique beers, these are no Once Were Warriors booze barns. For the morning-after coffee, the Chocolate Fish Caf\u00e9 on Wellington's south coast, where many of the stars had their homes, was apparently top choice. New Zealand, it must be said, had decent cappuccino and espresso in even reasonably small centres long before Britons stopped automatically reaching for the Nescaf\u00e9. And in Wellington's Cuba Mall, at the heart of the capital's caf\u00e9 culture, you can find not only good coffee, but browse in second-hand music and books stores and get a tattoo in studios bordering the capital's red-light - usually more red-lite - district. (Plastic sheep available of course). The members of the fellowship did just this with matching body art as a permanent souvenir. On more sedate occasions popular hangouts included Logan Browns, an upmarket restaurant in an old bank vault, and The White House, overlooking the harbour, which both feature local seafood and produce. Diners in all price ranges have gained enormously from the country's growing reorientation to Asia, creating a melting pot from which chef Peter Gordon sprang to make waves in London with his fusion cuisine. He can still be regularly spotted back in Wellington teaching, cooking and checking out products in a land far from BSE. As distances and communications shrink the world, those who scoff at cosmopolitan aspirations in such a remote place should remember what used to be said about Australian 'cul-cha'. Small does not have to mean small-minded. New Zealand was the first country to give women the vote, having had two female Prime Ministers, and passed homosexual law reforms more than a decade before Britain. New Zealand Tourism acting chief executive Ted Hunter is revelling in the 'extraordinary opportunity' the films present.It is too early to talk of an effect on visitor numbers but he adds that hits on the organisation's website leapt with the addition of a clip showing some of the films' locations narrated by the country's other fantasy figure export - Lucy 'Xena Warrior Princess' Lawless. Adrenaline thrills are of course another New Zealand speciality. While film location scouts often take advantage of Queenstown's scenic beauty, with the Southern Alps towering above and Lake Wakatipu below, the Fellowship of the Rings cast took advantage of its reputation as the adventure capital of New Zealand, parapenting (jumping off mountain wearing skis and a parachute), horse riding, flyfishing and snowboarding on Coronet Peak in breaks between filming. Actor Orlando Bloom (elf Legolas) was even reported to have defied a film company ban on probably New Zealand's best-known action sport - bungee jumping - and taken the elasticated plunge. Together with Wood, Dominic Monaghan (Merry Brandybuck), Sean Astin (Sam) and Billy Boyd (Pippin Took) he also took every opportunity to hit the beaches to surf. In fact Bloom has become so enthusiastic that he even squeezed in a quick surf between jetting in and attending the recent premiere - and has publicly mused about buying a house in New Zealand. For those who prefer to watch international standard sports, the recent New Zealand Open featured golf's world number one, Tiger Woods, and yachting's America's Cup will be vigorously defended in Auckland once again. And finally there's the fashion - not a long sock in sight - with the current strength of the pound and weakness of the New Zealand dollar meaning guilt-free spending even for those without a film star's budget. Liv Tyler took her credit card to Zambesi and Starfish when she had the chance and local labels Karen Walker, NomD and World have also been making international names for themselves. For something maybe not that comfortable to slip into, there is always the new World of Wearable Art exhibition in Nelson, growing out of an annual alternative parade in a sunny corner of the islands, home to many artisans. Perhaps Theroux needs to think again next time his wardrobe needs restocking. Factfile The New Zealand Tourism board (020 7930 1662) has information on tour operators and destinations.
