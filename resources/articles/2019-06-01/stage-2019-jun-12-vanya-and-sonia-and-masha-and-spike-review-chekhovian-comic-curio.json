For much of its duration, Christopher Durang\u2019s drama seems a campy comedy depending on Chekhovian tropes and showbiz allusions. But suddenly, in the second half, Durang delivers two extended monologues that demonstrate his skill as a writer and lift the piece to another plane. The 57-year-old Vanya and his adopted sister, Sonia, appear fated to fulfil the destinies of the Chekhov characters after whom they are named. Their listless life in the family home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, is briefly illumined by the arrival of another sibling, Masha \u2013 a fading star of stage and screen who not only has a young lover, Spike, in tow but also invites them all to a costume party. The skimpy plot is stuffed with Chekhov references as Sonia announces, \u201cI am a wild turkey,\u201d as opposed to a seagull, and hymns an imagined cherry orchard. Having tried one\u2019s patience, Durang then rewards it by invoking a genuine Chekhovian theme: the dramatic effect of a visitor upon the visited. The play depends heavily on the performers and, happily, Walter Bobbie\u2019s production boasts some fine actors. Janie Dee beautifully captures Masha\u2019s preening self-regard and desperate desire to defy the years; having dressed as Snow White for the party, she finds herself mistaken for Norma Desmond. Rebecca Lacey shows the self-pitying Sonia\u2019s transformation by adopting, for the party, the voice and manner of Maggie Smith in California Suite; Lacey makes something genuinely touching of the second-act scene in which she takes a phone call from an unexpected admirer. Having little to do initially, Mark Hadfield savours Vanya\u2019s sustained paean to the 1950s. Sentimental nostalgia is avoided with the sharp reminder that it was also a decade in which to be gay was to be stigmatised. Michelle Asante as a psychic cleaner and Lewis Reeves as a young buck provide good support and, even though it is a lightweight play, it finally shows that Durang gets Chekhov\u2019s point: drama is about the growth from ignorance to knowledge. \u2022 At the Ustinov, Bath, until 6 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
