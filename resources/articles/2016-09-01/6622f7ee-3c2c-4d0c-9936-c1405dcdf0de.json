The pair meet in the Premier League for the first time at Watford on Sunday, having clashed when Mourinho was at Internazionale and Mazzarri managed Sampdoria and Napoli. Although Mazzarri has previously said that the Portuguese, now in charge at Manchester United, speaks \u201cso much rubbish\u201d after Mourinho reckoned that for the Italian \u201cbeating me is the most important thing in his career\u201d, there is now mutual respect following private discussions when Mazzarri took over at Inter in 2013. \u201cI have a very good relationship with Mourinho now,\u201d Mazzarri said. \u201cSometimes the press look at what happens in Italy \u2013 the same with [the Chelsea manager Antonio] Conte. It\u2019s normal when you fight for top positions that it happens but I have a very good relationship, a strong relationship with him. There is professional respect. \u201cIn life there are some episodes and moments but with time we got to know each other. At the beginning we did not know each other. We are both coaches that want our teams to perform in the best possible way and would do anything for that to happen. In Italy we were fighting for the top positions but, speaking professionally, I have great respect for him. I always have because he\u2019s a great manager.\u201d Roberto Pereyra and Paul Pogba will also be on opposite sides on Sunday afternoon following their respective moves from Juventus in the summer. The Watford player appears to have adapted seamlessly, whereas Pogba\u2019s initial adaptation has not been too smooth. Unsurprisingly Mazzarri says he would choose Pereyra over Pogba given a choice but he expects the French midfielder come good. \u201cAs a principle I fall in love with my players,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are very important. Pereyra is a great player, he runs from side to side, has great qualities and was the player I wanted. If I had to choose, I\u2019d pick Pereyra. \u201cBut Pogba is a champion. He is a very young player and this may have an influence on him adapting a little slower after changing team. Everything is new for him at the moment but with one play he can change the result.\u201d Watford will evaluate the fitness of Youn\u00e8s Kaboul and Sebastian Pr\u00f6dl because of minor knocks but Stefano Okaka remains out with a hamstring injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
