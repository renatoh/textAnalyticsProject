More than a decade along the line, have things changed?\" More than a decade on, very little has changed, although it's rather ironic that the Blackburn Rovers striker Jason Roberts, one of the players in the aforementioned advert who can be seen risking life and limb by pinching a chicken leg from hungry David Dunn's plate, recently mentioned on a Radio 5 Live phone-in that he restricts himself to a vegan diet during the football season, a state of affairs that is unlikely to endear himself to his meat-peddling employers. \"In response to Simon Bradley's question, I know that Bolo Zenden is a strict vegetarian and has been since the age of 19,\" writes Rayner Simpson of the Dutch midfielder who was a Premier League player until his release from the Stadium of Light at the end of last season. Raynor also points out that the former Blackpool and England legend Sir Stanley Matthews was also famously teetotal and a vegetarian but still played into his 50s, although it seems his lifestyle wasn't quite as healthy as his booze- and meat-free diet would suggest. In a forlorn Twitter plea for steers in the direction of other Premier League players who shun meat, the name of the former Liverpool Spice Boy Phil Babb cropped up on a number of occasions, as did those of \u2013 deep breath \u2013 Ramon Vegan, Earl Carrot, Stan Cauliflower, Asamoah Yam and Keny Jackett (Potato). Well, we tried. If you know of any Premier League footballers who don't eat meat, mail knowledge@theguardian.com. A HOME FROM HOME \"Jonny Allan has played home games for Northwich Victoria at four different grounds (The Drill Field, Wincham Park, Victoria Stadium and Moss Lane),\" writes Wayne Duncan. \"Has anyone ever played home games at more than four venues whilst still playing for the same team?\" Yes. Both Ciar\u00e1n Grant and Niall Mac Maghnais chipped in with the name of Derek Treacy, a one-club midfielder who spent his entire 17-year career playing for Dublin side Shamrock Rovers, making over 500 appearances for the Hoops in that time. \"Between leaving Glenmalure Park in 1987 and moving to their own ground in Tallaght in 2008, the aristocrats of Irish football played at five temporary homes: Tolka Park, the RDS, Dalymount Park, Richmond Park and Morton Stadium,\" wrote Niall, prompting the Knowledge to scratch around and investigate further. Some findings: while Treacy made his senior debut too late to play in Glenmalure Park, he did call the other five grounds home at one stage or another. And while the faithful servant of Rovers, who is now 40, never got to play a competitive game in their new stadium in Tallaght, his testimonial was staged there, so it's not at all outlandish to say he played home games at six different venues while still lining up for the same team. What is rather more outlandish, as Ciar\u00e1n points out, is that due to their increasingly dire financial straits at the time, homeless Rovers were once forced to play a \"home\" fixture against Cork City at their opponents' ground, Turner's Cross, on 27 September 2003. Attempts to find out if Treacy played in that match, or even sat on the bench to bring his tally of home grounds while playing for one club to seven, have thus far come to naught, however, a very helpful man named Noel at the Rovers office is on the case, so watch this space. Meanwhile in Brazil, this from Paulo Padhila: \"I would imagine a Corinthians player in Brazil may have played home games in more than four different venues, especially in recent times,\" he writes. \"The club doesn't have a proper home stadium, so they play most often in the city's stadium, Pacaembu. However, they host derbies and other big matches in S\u00e3o Paulo's stadium, Morumbi. In recent years they have started hosting games outside the city of S\u00e3o Paulo as well, to take advantage of the fact that they are the second most popular club in the country. They have played state championship games in Presidente Prudente and Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, as well as hosting a few matches in the state of Paran\u00e1 (not sure which cities exactly). I would think there's at least one player who has taken part in a number of these games over the past few years. Felipe, their goalie, might be a good bet, as he's been with the club since 2007.\" MATCHES IN WORKING HOURS (2) Last week we recalled the last time professional football matches on English soil had been played during normal working hours, a trip down memory lane that prompted some of you to write in with more always-welcome information. \"I remember a few years back that Halifax Town were due to play Hartlepool in the Auto Windscreens Trophy (or whatever it was called then),\" writes Andy Burrows. \"It was the last game of a three-team group stage, and, as both teams had mathematically no chance of progressing, they asked the FA if they could simply not bother playing the game. The FA refused, so the match went ahead, as I recall, on a Friday afternoon, to save on floodlight costs. I think about a hundred people turned up.\" That's a sterling effort by Andy, although he's not quite right as the Football League Trophy (as it was then known) match in question, which Hartlepool won 1-0, was actually played on 7 December 1999, which was a Tuesday. Our thanks to Southampton fan Steve Grant for helping us out with that one, not least for pointing out that \"one notable player in the Halifax line-up was current Norwich striker Grant Holt\". But wait, here's Tommy Hughes. \"As you may know, Scottish bank holidays often differ from the rest of the UK, yet Berwick as a Scottish League team are regularly allocated home bank holiday fixtures during English working hours \u2013 particularly on 2 January (us Scots get an extra day's bank holiday at new year to sober up),\" writes Tommy. \"I attended Berwick Rangers against my beloved Clydebank FC at a 3pm kick-off on 2 January 2001. Poor Berwick fans and players had to take the day off work to attend their own home game, whereas the Bankies fans and players had no such problems.\" THE KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE Upset at the treatment being meted out to him by assorted Fleet Street sages on the Sunday Supplement a few days ago, an exasperated Joey Barton was moved to tweet: \"I d actually pay good money to watch any journo play one half of premier league football in front of 52,000 people\". Although you don't have to be a qualified carpenter to know if the chair you're sitting on is broken, his comment moved The Knowledge to dredge up this query, which we first answered in October 2007. \"Has a journalist ever won an international cap?\" asked James Knowles, who with the benefit of hindsight, could have asked: Has a journalist ever won the same number of international caps as Joey Barton? Or more caps than Joey Barton? Here's how we replied: indeed they have James, albeit predominantly in Norway for some reason. Perhaps the most famous journalist/footballer in his home country is J\u00f8rgen Juve, who is still Norway's top scorer. Reader Lasse Midttun explains that \"Juve made his debut as an international in 1928 and was hired as sports editor of Dagbladet (still Norway's third largest newspaper) the same year\". More remarkable still is that he achieved his goal record of 33 in 45 starts despite starting more than half of those matches as a defender. Another journalist to play for Norway was Faedrelandvennen hack Svein Mathisen, as his countryman Roy recalls. Having played most of his football at IK Start \u2013 barring a brief spell at Hearts \u2013 Mathisen's 25th and final cap for his country came in unusual circumstances. Not picked in the Norwegians' World Cup qualifying squad to face Denmark in 1984, he was called up from his position in the press box after one of the first-choice forwards was injured in the warm-up. It was the last time he would play for Norway though, despite not retiring until 1989. Goalkeeper Ola By Rise, as both Thomas Baardseng and Rikard W\u00e6r\u00f8 point out, enjoyed a lengthy footballing career from 1977 to 1995, in which time he combined shot-stopping at Rosenborg with filing copy for Trondheim newspaper Adresseavisen. By Rise spent most of his international career as understudy to Erik Thorstvedt; despite playing for Norway on 25 occasions, his 54 other appearances on the Norway bench earned him the unenviable record of international football's least-used substitute. At least the Danish midfielder Morten Bruun bucked the Norwegian trend. Mikkel Svinth R\u00f8dgaard takes up the tale: \"He captained Silkeborg for more than a decade and apparently resisted the temptation to move abroad in 1990 because he was about to begin his studies at the Danish school of journalism. He was a student of journalism at least, when he played his last international against Norway in April 1992. He finished his studies in 1995, but was never again selected for Denmark.\" \u2022 For thousands more questions and answers, take a trip through the Knowledge archive, or treat yourself to copies of The Knowledge: Your Football Questions Answered and its thrilling sequel More Knowledge: More of Your Football Questions Answered.
