In the time before he fell prey to a knee injury, although never on a Sunday, he rewrote the manual of how the game could and should be played. He was massively athletic and yet horribly destructive, clever and cruel. The All Blacks that won their one and only World Cup were never seriously challenged at that tournament, destroying Wales in the semi-final and France in the final. It was the age of John Kirwan, Sean Fitzpatrick, Wayne Shelford and Grant Fox \u2013but above all, of Michael Jones. Of course, as they are constantly reminded, the All Blacks have failed to win a World Cup since that sunlit day in Auckland 23 years ago. It has to be said the odds on them doing so next year were reduced considerably when the duties of hosting the tournament were granted to them, a reward for their services to the game, but hardly an investment in the development of the sport in pastures new. Still, the monkey can only be removed from the back of New Zealand by the players who will perform in the famous old shirt next autumn. Home advantage might even work against them as they face up to the challenge of being World Cup chokers. So far, they have used the insult to help them develop a team \u2013 a squad \u2013 that could become their best ever. \"Enough is enough\", seems to be the mantra within their ranks. No mistakes this time; no point of weakness. The All Blacks may not be the most brutal scrummagers on earth, but not even Argentina will shove them around, especially if Carl Hayman comes home from his extended \"overseas experience\", the rite of passage for citizens of the land at the end of the earth. They may have the odd issue in the Tri-Nations at the lineout, but they will win enough through any combination of Sam Whitelock, Tom Donnelly, Anthony Boric, Brad Thorn and Ali Williams (should he ever recover from his Achilles problems) to give the backs plenty of room to run. And once New Zealand have the ball the rest of the world had better watch out, for never has a side looked more comfortable on the ball in any situation, in any position. They are graceful and slick, with Dan Carter cruising into position so late that defenders cannot track his runs until the danger has overrun them. Even if the fly-half is contained, any number of players can take on the role of playmaker, from the subtle Conrad Smith to the outrageously novel Sonny Bill Williams, with his giant hands, one at a time, reinventing the off-load. Those playmaking stand-ins include all the forwards, even the rotund Tony Woodcock. But they embrace in particular the back row, the positions New Zealand cherish above all others. Richie McCaw may be penalised a little more frequently now, and David Pocock of Australia is a direct challenger for his crown, but Kieran Read is fast becoming a No8 out there on his own. Jerome Kaino would be a model No6 except that he is more conspicuous than the template demands. He doesn't just grub around on the floor, but stands tall in the loose. In short, the All Blacks are developing into a side we may be honoured to call the best ever. They have to win the World Cup, of course, and that will be a challenge that will stretch them more than anything they are encountering on this grand slam tour of our end of the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
