His spiritual name was Copper Thunderbird, though he was born Jean-Baptiste Norman Henry Morrisseau in Fort William (now called Thunder Bay), Ontario, the eldest of a family of boys. As the eldest, and in accordance with Anishinabek tradition, his parents had him raised by his maternal grandparents. He attended a local Catholic-run residential school, then a state school. His first recollection of drawing was in the sand on beaches at the age of six, and though he was self-taught, he was helped with the methods and history of art by early patrons: Selwyn Dewdney, an expert on Anishnaabe art and anthropology, and Esther and Joseph Weinstein - Esther discussed spirituality with him, while Joseph, an artist and physician, taught him about techniques and materials. Morrisseau's curiosity was fuelled by his passion for the traditions of his people. Having studied the legends and visual expressions of the Anishinabek, as well as religious paintings of the Italian Renaissance, through his patrons' art books, he was once described as \"both the subject and object of a one-man ethnology\". Nonetheless, he did not depict traditional Anishinabek imagery until his late teens. In creating his paintings, he went against the wishes of those who felt that cultural matters such as these were best kept within their community. The spiritual side of the Anishnaabe had long been suppressed by successive religious orders, and Morrisseau's bold, iconic paintings of sacred thunderbirds, medicine snakes and shamanic practice were seen as proud renditions of a culture that had gone underground for safekeeping. In 1957 Morrisseau married Harriet Kakegamic, a Cree woman from Sandy Lake Reserve in Ontario. She taught him how to sign his paintings using Cree syllabics, which was to become a key element in the style of painting he developed. He was the originator - and best known - of a group of painters originally called the Woodland School, but who now refer to themselves as Anishnaabe artists. Their distinctive imagery comprised birchbark scrolls with schematic drawings of rituals, red ochre pictographs that marked the cliff faces of lakes in the region, and illustrations of vivid dreams that animated a primordial oral history passed down through the elders. Morrisseau's contribution contained some of the most stunning and vibrant canvases imaginable. His sinewy black lines unfurled into creatures of the under and upper worlds of the Anishinabek, and could barely contain the energy created by his masterful combinations of intense colour. Now his canvases grace the walls of galleries around the world. His first solo exhibition in Toronto in 1962 caused a sensation, and critics proclaimed him as a genius. His work was shown across Canada and at major international events such as Expo 67 in Montreal and the exhibition Magicians of the Earth at the Centre Pompidou, Paris, in 1989. An intensely charismatic man, Morrisseau was highly skilled at handling the attention he drew to himself. During the 1970s and 80s, alcohol and drug abuse left him homeless at times: he ascribed his state to the bad treatment he had received at the Catholic residential school in his childhood, a form of suffering familiar to many aboriginal people in Canada. But he still continued to paint, and from the 1990s enjoyed a long period of stability, culminating in his 2006 solo exhibition at the National Gallery of Canada, the first to be staged by a First Nations artist there. His half-century of creative output was recognised at the highest levels in Canada, with the Centennial Medal, membership of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, the Order of Canada and several honorary doctoral degrees. His own people also honoured him; most recently, he was recognised with a National Aboriginal Lifetime Achievement award. He is survived by his children - David, Michael, Peter, Eugene, Christian, Victoria and Lisa. Harriet, from whom he separated in 1975, died in 1995. \u00b7 Norval (Jean-Baptiste Norman Henry) Morrisseau (Copper Thunderbird), artist, born March 14 1932; died December 4 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
