He took a level-par 72 and it was, he said, \"nothing like those easy 65s\". Easy 65s? Perhaps only the perpetual world No1 can say such outlandish things with a straight face and mean them. Woods is four shots behind four players in Skip Kendall, Jay Haas, Bob Tway and Rocco Mediate, but rightly reckons that he is far from out of contention here. Part of yesterday's problem for Woods was that he lost 6lb in three days during the bout of food poisoning that hit him the night before he won last Sunday at Bay Hill. It has left him feeling weak and not able to practise as much he would like. His preparation for this week's event consisted of only nine holes. Yesterday he was scratchy on the practice range and out of sync on the course. \"I just never got it on track,\" he said. \"Getting to even par, from two over, was a heck of an accomplishment. It could easily have been 77, 78, 79. But I made some good putts, some good up and downs. \"That's the way golf is. It's very fickle. Some of my swings were too steep, some too shallow. I never felt the path of my arc today.\" It was, he confessed, \"a lot of hard work\". He added: \"Days like these are a heck of a lot tougher than those easy 65s. Those days things just go your way. You know, you hit your shots and are shaping the ball correctly, you're making putts and everything is pretty easy.\" Of course. Colin Montgomerie, seemingly released from his early- season woes, played his first nine holes, the back nine, in two under, good scoring as the wind became blustery. The Scot dropped a shot at the 1st and then two more at the long 2nd. His drive clattered into the trees and the laser equipment that measures every shot on the course these days registered 315 yards to go to the pin - and no shot. Montgomerie chopped out sideways and now he had 316 yards to the pin, plus another bad lie. He managed to move the ball 127 yards, into more rough, and then 144 yards on to the green. Two putts and he had his seven and a ruined scorecard. Things got worse for the Scot on his last hole. The siren indicating lightning in the vicinity sounded, meaning play must stop immediately. Monty had a nine-inch putt for two over par, was not allowed to hit it and strode off, furious. He will have to return for a 7.30am start today, just for that putt. Michael Campbell, last year's European Open champion, produced an extraordinary round which began with two sixes and got worse. He returned an 87, shot an 89 and was disqualified for an incorrect score on one hole. Afterwards the New Zealander said that he had lifted some luggage last week and done some damage to the rotator cuff in his left shoulder, and could not get through the ball. Darren Clarke promised himself a new beginning this year. A perennial underachiever, his 11 tournament wins worldwide fail to reflect his ball-striking ability, and his biggest victory, over Woods in the Accenture Match Play final in 2000, starkly illustrates the heights to which he should aspire. So at the start of 2003 Clarke took on a new set of clubs, a new caddie and set about arming himself with a new attitude. He had received a letter from the sports psychologist Dr Bob Rotella, whom he had briefly consulted in the past, saying that it was pointless doing things in dribs and drabs and that he should commit to the complete works. Clarke accepted the idea and last week, before the Bay Hill Invitational, he called in at Rotella's office in Naples, Florida, and stayed for a day and a half. It was a mixture of counselling and anger management, for the Irishman has had a notoriously short fuse. \"He has to learn to love his wedge and his putter,\" said Rotella. If Clarke has taken those words to heart, then the affair was not consummated yesterday. He hit a series of superb shots over his first nine holes, giving himself birdie chance after birdie chance. But he accepted only one - a two-putt birdie at the long 16th. \"It was the longest putt I made all day,\" he said. Altogether he had 18 for those nine holes, a truly shocking number, and although there are no statistics for such things it is safe to assume that no one out on the course took more. There were 15 more to follow on his homeward half and to be one under par for the round, with 33 putts, denotes play through the green of the highest standard. He had a chance to be two under, given that he had the long 9th as his last hole, but his second shot strayed into a bunker and his third was short and to the right of the green. The sand wedge was waved angrily at the bank of the bunker but, perhaps remembering Rotella, he saved par and was all beams as he shook hands with his playing partners. \"I would have been very disappointed with level par, so it was important to close like that,\" Clarke said. Sergio Garcia, off to a poor start to his season, eagled the long 16th before finishing on 71. He is trying to do something about that flicky bit at the top of his backswing. It is, of course, taking time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
