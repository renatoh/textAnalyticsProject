Then, Epstein was suspected of similar crimes in Florida, where Acosta was a top federal prosecutor. \u201cI feel very badly actually for secretary Acosta because I\u2019ve known him as being somebody that works so hard and has done such a good job,\u201d said Trump, who previously called Epstein \u201ca terrific guy\u201d. \u201cI feel very badly about that whole situation. But we\u2019re going to be looking at that, and looking at it very closely.\u201d Epstein was arrested on Saturday after disembarking from a private flight from France. He pleaded not guilty to federal charges brought on Monday in New York. A bail hearing is set for next Monday. Critics of Acosta said Epstein should never have been allowed to walk free after dozens of young girls began to step forward in 2005 to identify as victims of a man now charged with assaulting underage girls, paying them off with cash and inducing them to lure other young girls to his homes. As part of a secret plea deal signed by Acosta in 2008 and criticized as \u201cridiculously lenient\u201d, Epstein pleaded guilty to a state-level charge of soliciting prostitution from girls as young as 14 and registered as a sex offender. Trump said that was \u201ca long time ago\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s been a great, really great secretary of labor,\u201d Trump said, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cThe rest of it, we\u2019ll have to look at it very carefully. But you\u2019re talking about a long time ago and again it was a decision made, I think, not by him but by a lot of people.\u201d A growing wave of Democrats called for Acosta to step down. Scattered Republicans said a review of the plea deal appeared appropriate. \u201cIf [Acosta] refuses to resign, president Trump should fire him,\u201d the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said on the floor of the chamber. \u201cInstead of prosecuting a predator and serial sex trafficker of children, Acosta chose to let him off. We cannot have as one of the leading appointed officials in America someone who has done this.\u201d Acosta defended himself on Twitter, calling Epstein\u2019s alleged crimes \u201chorrific\u201d and saying new evidence had come to light. \u201cNow that new evidence and additional testimony is available, the NY prosecution offers an important opportunity to more fully bring him to justice,\u201d Acosta tweeted. But critics argue that plenty of evidence of Epstein\u2019s alleged misdeeds, including a 53-page sex crimes indictment prepared in 2007 and built on a years-long FBI investigation, was available to Acosta and his team 10 years ago. In a report by the Miami Herald, whose work on the case was cited on Monday by prosecutors in New York, multiple sources involved in the case at the time accused Acosta of caving to pressure from Epstein\u2019s lawyers. Republican senator Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the judiciary committee, said on Tuesday: \u201cIf this plea deal doesn\u2019t withstand scrutiny, then it would be the job of the judiciary committee to find out how it got off the rails.\u201d His Republican colleague Joni Ernst added: \u201cI do think it\u2019s imperative that we take a look at it.\u201d Personal connections inside the Trump administration to Epstein could complicate the picture. Epstein once taught at a school run by the father of the attorney general William Barr, who said on Tuesday he would not recuse himself from the case but that he would decline to take part in any review of the Florida plea deal. Trump himself described Epstein, who has said he made a fortune managing money for billionaires, as a friend in a 2002 magazine profile. \u201cI\u2019ve known Jeff for 15 years,\u201d Trump said then. \u201cTerrific guy. He\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it \u2013 Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\u201d On Tuesday Trump distanced himself from Epstein. \u201cI knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him,\u201d the president said. \u201cI mean people in Palm Beach knew him. He was a fixture in Palm Beach. I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve spoken to him for 15 years. I wasn\u2019t a fan \u2026 I was not a fan of his. That I can tell you. I was not a fan of his.\u201d The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, tweeted that Trump had all the information he needed to make a decision about Acosta. \u201cSecretary Acosta must step down,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs US attorney, he engaged in an unconscionable agreement with Jeffrey Epstein kept secret from courageous, young victims preventing them from seeking justice. This was known by [Trump] when he appointed him to the cabinet.\u201d But Pelosi stopped short of calling for a congressional investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the president, it\u2019s his cabinet,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cWe have a great deal of work to do here for the good of the American people and we have to focus on that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
