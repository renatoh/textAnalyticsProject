It is directed by the movie veteran who directed the small-screen original, Martin Campbell. A serving police officer sees his daughter shot in front of him, and discovers her murder is connected with a top-level conspiracy to suppress her environmental activism. The haunted copper, originally played by Bob Peck, is now the more chiselled Mel Gibson \u2013 though unforgivingly lit in such a way as to emphasise his careworn wrinkles. The film takes the revelations and twists at a hectic gallop, though it omits the spiritual, Gaia-is-angry mysticism of the original. It's not too bad, though it lacks the style of the recent film version of State of Play, and Gibson is pretty flat. Perhaps 80s paranoia will come back into vogue and someone will remake the Gabriel Byrne thriller Defence of the Realm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
