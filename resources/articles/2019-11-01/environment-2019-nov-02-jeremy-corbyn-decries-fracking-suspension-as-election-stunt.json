The government announced an immediate moratorium on fracking on Friday in a major U-turn after the Oil and Gas Authority said in a report that it was unable to predict the magnitude of any earthquakes triggered by hydraulic fracturing. One in August measured 2.9 on the Richter scale. Jeremy Corbyn described the move as \u201cgreenwash\u201d and an election stunt. \u201cI think it sounds like fracking would come back on 13 December, if they were elected back into office,\u201d the Labour leader said on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re quite clear, we will end fracking. We think it\u2019s unnecessary, we think it\u2019s pollutive of ground water systems, and also all the evidence from Preston New Road in Lancashire is it\u2019s actually dangerous and has caused serious earth tremors.\u201d The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, described the announcement as \u201ca bit of a distraction\u201d. \u201cA moratorium is half a step in the right direction, but at the end of the day this is a government that has abolished the [Department of Energy and Climate Change] and has been making it harder and preventing on-shore wind farms being built,\u201d she said. The interventions came after the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, made it clear that the moratorium was only in place \u201cuntil the science changes\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment but we\u2019ve always been clear that we will follow the science \u2026 the Oil and Gas Authority is one of the world\u2019s best regulators and they have said to us that we cannot be certain that shale gas can be extracted safely,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Asked why a permanent ban was not being imposed, she replied: \u201cBecause this is a huge opportunity for the United Kingdom, but we will follow the science. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking to see now is the exploration that Cuadrilla have carried out at Preston New Road, there will be some reports of what the potential is from those wells. So we will have better information in the future once that data has been assessed.\u201d She added: \u201cIt is quite clear that we can\u2019t be certain. The science isn\u2019t accurate enough to be able to assess the fault lines, the geological studies have been shown to be inaccurate and therefore unless, and until we can be absolutely certain we are imposing a moratorium.\u201d Claire Stephenson from Frack Free Lancashire welcomed the end of the government\u2019s \u201cgratuitous\u201d support for fracking. \u201cOur position, however, is unchanged. We believe that only an outright ban is appropriate to protect the residents and the communities they live in, and our campaign will actively continue until one is implemented,\u201d she said. Susan Holliday, the chair of the Preston New Action Group, also called for a total ban. \u201cThe earthquakes in August were felt by thousands of people. It must be clear from this that the Fylde coast is just not suitable for fracking,\u201d she said. \u201cIt must be a huge relief for those communities that are currently under the threat of planning applications for fracking, knowing that they will now no longer need to go through what we have.\u201d Friends of the Earth\u2019s chief executive, Craig Bennett, hailed the move as a \u201ctremendous victory\u201d but urged the passage of new laws to enshrine an outright ban on fracking. \u201cWe must now ensure that legislation is passed so that the ban is made permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t stop with banning fracking here if we are going to avoid catastrophic climate change. Time is running out. The UK must stop funding fracking abroad and we must leave all fossil fuels in the ground.\u201d The Green party co-leader Si\u00e2n Berry tweeted: \u201cBanning fracking is for life, not just for Christmas.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
