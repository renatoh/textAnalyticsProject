The angry supporters staged a protest on the touchline, causing the referee, Cl\u00e9ment Turpin, to stop the game after 11 minutes and send both teams back into the dressing rooms. Bordeaux\u2019s group of hardcore fans, known as the Ultramarines, were demanding the resignation of the longtime president, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Longu\u00e9p\u00e9e, despite the club\u2019s impressive season so far. The players returned to the field after Tuesday night\u2019s disturbance to crush N\u00eemes 6-0 and move up to third in the table. Josh Maja, the 20-year-old London-born Nigeria striker, sparked the rout with two first-half goals. The former Sunderland man completed his hat-trick early in the second half before Nicolas de Pr\u00e9ville added a fourth and Otavio scored twice. Bordeaux are seven points behind PSG in the Ligue 1 table and five behind Marseille, for whom Dimitri Payet scored a penalty and set up a goal for Morgan Sanson in a 2-0 win at Angers. Elsewhere, Cristian Battocchio also netted a treble as Stade Brestois crushed Racing Strasbourg 5-0. while Lyon lost 1-0 at home to Lille."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
