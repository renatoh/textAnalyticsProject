Its audio facilities are very impressive. The Jukebox's 20GB hard disk is capable of archiving up to 400 albums of MP3 music transferred from a PC or recorded directly from a hi-fi/CD player via the unit's on-board MP3 encoder. Then there's the imaging side. Factor in a plug-in camera and the user can take both still (JPeg) and moving (up to 40 hours of MPeg4) images that can then be reviewed on the Jukebox's 1.5inch 320 x 240 colour screen. The Jukebox can also connect to a TV to play back footage. Inevitably, battery life could be better - it's more like six hours than the manufacturer's claimed eight - and the Jukebox is not the most elegant gadget on sale. Yet, for an innovative roll-call of facilities and massive storage, the Jukebox is one of the year's must-have gadgets. www.archos.com Rivals Apple iPod from \u00a3259, Creative Jukebox 3 from \u00a3300 2 Fuji @xia Slimshot \u00a380 2002 was the year digital photography stormed the mainstream, as the trickle of low-budget, low-resolution cameras turned into a flood. Easily the most elegant and usable of the sub \u00a3100 snappers is the Fuji @xia Slimshot. Other models claimed to be credit card thin, yet only the Slimshot is skinny enough (6mm) to fit into a wallet or shirt pocket. And while it took low-resolution 640 x 480m pixel images, a feature called an Auto-Brite sensor ensured images were sharper and more colourful than its rivals. www.fujifilm.co.uk Rivals SiPix Snap \u00a340, L'Espion Digital Dream DDR52100 \u00a340 3 Sony Clie PEG NR-70V \u00a3425 The NR-70V re-wrote the PDA rulebook with an innovative clamshell design that split open to pair a large LCD screen on the top frame with an easy to use full Qwerty keyboard underneath. Music fans were offered an integrated MP3/ATRAC 3 audio player, while gMovie and Picture Gear Pocket software enabled the user to view video and still images. An on-board digital camera with a swivel-round lens, which enabled the user to take snaps of themselves, added to the fun. Sony also launched several new applications including Clie Remote Commander, which enables the PDA to moonlight as a remote control for home entertainment products. Overall, a wonderfully executed Palm-compatible PDA. www.sony.co.uk Rivals Handspring Treo 90 \u00a3250, Sharp Zaurus SL-5500 \u00a3350 4 Panasonic DMR-HS2 \u00a31,000 In spite of a format war that threatened to kill the product category off, DVD video recorders have been one of the big success stories of the year. Panasonic has now taken the debate into new territory with the launch of the HS2 - the first unit to team up a DVD recorder with a hard disk recording system. The theory is that users will timeshift programmes on the hard disk and then archive them on to a DVD disc. It's far from the perfect solution. The lack of an easy to use electronic programming guide (as used on the Sky+ and TiVo boxes) is a noteworthy omission, while the DVD-RAM's format compatibility problems (its discs won't play back in most standard DVD players) is annoying. Still, Panasonic has given home cinema enthusiasts a glimpse of the future. www.panasonic.co.uk Rivals Sky+ \u00a3300 plus subscription Philips DVDR880 \u00a3500 5 Compaq HP iPaq 3970 \u00a3550 Last year, this model's predecessors, the H3800 series PDAs, played a significant role in establishing Microsoft's Pocket PC operating system as top choice for those after a high-end handheld. Surprisingly, Compaq HP has chosen not to tamper too greatly with its formula. The styling and features are the same, although under the hood is a new Xscale PXA250 400MHz processor that replaces the 206MHz chip in previous models and enhances video playback and web surfing. HP Compaq has also added a cool application called Nevo, which enables the user to control their TV. The iPaq is still our favourite high-end business PDA, and is a terrific product. Yet unless the company does something about its poor battery life and relatively chunky design, we are unlikely to be as generous next time. www.hp.com Rivals Palm Tungsten T \u00a3400 Toshiba e740 \u00a3580 6 Orange SPV \u00a3169 (with Orange contract) Currently on offer at \u00a3100 The only mobile phone on our list, Orange's SPV is the first to use Microsoft's Smartphone operating system. Hence, not only is it incredibly intuitive for those weaned on Windows, but it also sports a Windows Media Player for replay of music, still image and video files. 7 Philips Streamium MC-i200 \u00a3400 A new breed of hi-fi, the Streamium not only includes an FM tuner alongside its CD player, but also a web browser optimised to deliver internet radio stations via a connection to a broadband modem. 8 Innogear Duex MP302 $179 A neat twist on the USB storage devices that have become very popular this year, the chewing gum pack-sized Duex also includes an integrated MP3 player and voice recorder. So, in addition to housing files and documents, any spare capacity of its 128MB storage can be loaded with your favourite tunes. www.innogear.com 9 Gyration Ultra Cordless Optical Mouse \u00a379 Rather cool cordless optical mouse that works both on the desktop, or if you prefer, waved around in the air. www.gyration.co.uk 10 Olympus C-50 Zoom \u00a3549 Five megapixels on a compact model, plus a host of controls make this one of the best value cameras of the year. www.olympus.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
