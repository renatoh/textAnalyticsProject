Fabio Capello's side can move six points clear at the head of the group by defeating Wales on Tuesday evening, a result that would leave them requiring a point from their final match, against Montenegro in Podgorica next month, to smooth passage to the tournament in Ukraine and Poland. The play-offs are scheduled for the international window in November and, if England have topped the group, that slot would be filled instead with the prestige friendly against Spain. England intend to follow that with a rearranged visit from the world's top-ranked side, Holland, in February after the rioting in London prevented the friendly against the Dutch from taking place last month. The matches against the world's best teams would offer Capello an intriguing insight into the progress his younger players have made ahead of the finals in the summer. \"If we qualify, we will play against Spain, against Holland,\" the England manager said. \"That makes [topping the section] more important. \"It will be important to qualify quickly and then play these friendly games to see the [young] players play against really important teams. For the young players, though, it is also important to stay in the squad alongside the older ones and understand the big difference between the under-21s, the clubs and the national team. If they do that, they will understand it is a big, big difference.\" Capello, who lost Leighton Baines back to Everton on Monday with a hamstring strain, is expected to tweak his team's formation and approach from those that served so well in Bulgaria, on the assumption that Wales are unlikely to be expansive in their tactics. James Milner may be used on the right of midfield to counter the considerable threat posed by Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale. Milner will most likely replace Theo Walcott, although the attacking pair of Ashley Young and Wayne Rooney is unlikely to be altered. The management team are aware that Scott Parker and Gareth Barry \u2013 along with Ashley Cole and Young \u2013 are one booking away from missing the final fixture in Montenegro. A recall for Frank Lampard in midfield would be born from a desire for extra attacking thrust from deep through the centre as England seek a first win at the national stadium in a year. \"Probably we will change the style,\" said Capello, who will finalise his line-up on Tuesday. \"I need to decide but probably I will change because we need to play differently because we play at home. The position of some players on the pitch will be different and the personnel may also change. It's very different playing on the counterattack, and using the space, rather than receiving the ball with your back to goal. Really different. But I will choose the best XI for the occasion. On Lampard we will see tomorrow.\" The Chelsea midfielder, who was granted only 10 minutes in Sofia, has benefited from a public show of support from his club-mate and captain, John Terry, who claimed Lampard still has a significant role to play with the national team after a career that has spanned 87 caps and 22 goals. \"He'll bounce back,\" Terry said. \"If anyone wants to write him off, they do so at their peril. I think it lacks a bit of respect towards Frank given what he's given to his country. He's one of the best midfielders England have ever seen. Don't write him off. \"We find that there's that feeling that we, as the more experienced players in the group, take our selection for granted. People think that but we certainly don't. Frank would never rest on his laurels. He'll work as hard now as he always does for Chelsea. He's probably one of the best professionals I've come across in the game and this won't be on his mind. \"In the past players have been questioned about not coming and playing for England. He's got that many caps already that no one could question his commitment towards England.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
