The mystical Dr Dee would, perhaps, have understood the passion stirred by Geosciences Australia\u2019s recent decision to stop producing or selling paper versions of its topographic maps in December, citing dwindling demand. In the 21st century, digital files might be more practical, particularly for a cash-strapped federal government agency. But not everyone loveth and getteth their maps for purely practical reasons. Just ask Brendan Whyte. He\u2019s a curator at the National Library of Australia, responsible for acquiring a copy of every map published in Australia, as well as managing a collection of perhaps a million or so charts and about the same number of aerial photographs. A geographer by training, he knows that some people don\u2019t appreciate electronic cartography. \u201cOne of the problems, with the development of GIS [geographic information systems] and everyone making their own maps is that people just dump their data without thinking about the aesthetics or what the map is trying to tell a reader.\u201d A map, he says, needs beauty so that users want to look at it and absorb what it contains. But that\u2019s less about particular platforms, whether digital or otherwise, than the cartographer\u2019s skill. Whyte gives, as an example of what can be done with data, Minard\u2019s famous map of Napoleon\u2019s Russian campaign, on which a band represents both the progress and the extent of the Grande Arm\u00e9e juxtaposed against temperatures in 1812 and 1813, so that the viewer necessarily imagines the privations of a disintegrating army throughout a terrible Russian winter. Whyte also admires the artistry of the Marshall Island stick charts from the NLA\u2019s own collection. It\u2019s believed to be from the early 1970s. \u201cThey\u2019re thin pieces of coconut wood put together in a sort of lattice like a cat\u2019s cradle and wherever there was an atoll they\u2019d lash on [a] little cowrie shell to represent that island. The bits of coconut wood represent the routes, the wave patterns, the winds, the currents. So they\u2019re not a geographical representation like a modern map, but more how a navigator might get from one island to another via the sea route in a canoe with a big sail.\u201d His favourite catalogued item might also be one of the smallest, an atlas from Queen Mary\u2019s dollhouse. \u201cA lot of publishing companies and authors produced real books for her dollhouse. The famous map shop and publishers Stanfords made her the Atlas of the British Empire, reducing it to about two inches high.\u201d At the State Library of Victoria, the librarian Sarah Ryan also nominates an atlas \u2013 albeit a rather bigger one \u2013 as a particularly treasured item. \u201cIt\u2019s known as the first modern day atlas, even though it was produced in 1572: Ortelius\u2019s Mirror of the World. The printing of that volume is beautiful and the maps are very colourful, and you\u2019ve got lots of iconography like sea monsters and ships and compass roses.\u201d She agrees that, while digital maps can be more convenient, a lot of people still prefer paper, particularly for recreational uses. Ultimately, though, it\u2019s relationships that matter. \u201cWhat pulls you to maps,\u201d she says, \u201cis that connection with people and place and culture.\u201d By way of example, she talks of looking at the SLV\u2019s Atlas of Paris from 1739, just after her own first trip to the city. \u201cI\u2019d visited all those places, so that has a strong connection to me.\u201d Maps, of course, also document territorial claims. The catalogue describes the SLV\u2019s rarest map as coming \u201cfrom the survey of Mr Wedge and others\u201d. The attribution sounds innocuous until you identify the surveyor as the John Wedge who accompanied John Batman on his expedition across Bass Strait. The yellowing paper thus signals the plans for a township in Port Phillip \u2013 and the beginning of Indigenous dispossession. Yet, if maps represent power, they can also show change. It\u2019s a point made by Kay Dancey, the CartoGIS Services Manager at the College of Asia and the Pacific at the Australian National University. A cartographer by training, Dancey provides data visualisation for ANU researchers, as well as managing a collection of hardcopy and digital maps. Her holdings feature items dating back to the 17th century, and include 18th-century works by the French hydrographer and philosopher Jacques-Nicolas Bellin. \u201cThe sheer craft of how they produced these maps \u2026 They\u2019re invariably copper engravings, and there\u2019s such skill required in this process. And then there\u2019s the beauty: the fabulous colours and cartouches that they employ.\u201d But, when asked to describe a favoured map, she nominates something very different. \u201cThere\u2019s a lovely map here,\u201d she says, \u201ca wall map of Africa from the 1950s. It\u2019s one of my favourites because it has hand made corrections to the country name Zaire or the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as it is now. I particularly love that because it has been in this mapping unit for 60 years and these hand annotations have been by made by cartographers over that time. So it\u2019s a gorgeous link back to the people who have worked as cartographers at the ANU, a reminder of changing sovereignties and what a map is: a snapshot of time and an abstraction of place.\u201d In that spirit, she notes the real innovations of digital technology making both data and mapping platforms more widely available, and thus facilitating what she calls \u201ca democratising phase of cartography\u201d. The maps of Adam Mattinson provide an obvious example. By day, Mattinson works as a geospatial analyst for an engineering firm. In his own time, he uses his cartographic training to represent the local landscape in strange and fantastical forms. In one project, he depicts a Melbourne constructed on Port Phillip as it looked in the Ice Age; in another work in progress, he imagines the city after massive rises in sea levels. In the book How to Lie with Maps, Mark Monmonier notes what he calls \u201cthe cartographic paradox\u201d. To present complex information from a three-dimensional world clearly in two-dimensional format, the surveyor must abstract and distort. In other words, as Monmonier says, \u201cto present a useful and truthful picture, an accurate map must tell white lies.\u201d Mattinson\u2019s work takes that idea to its logical conclusion. He\u2019s probably best known for his Tolkienesque depiction of the Yarra Ranges, in which The Patch looks almost like Hobbiton and the warning \u201cPuffing Billy Roams this Area\u201d appears alongside a depiction of a dragon. \u201cIt\u2019s covering an area in which I grew up,\u201d he says. \u201cTo me, the landscape there really lends itself to a Middle Earth kind of quality.\u201d As a child, Mattinson used to open the street directory at a random page and then trace his finger to find his way home. \u201cI think that\u2019s where the passion for maps springs for a lot of kids. They look at a map and they see that the world is bigger than they had thought.\u201d Though he works with digital platforms, he loves how physical maps encourage people to gather and discuss the landscape. \u201cIt really is a perfect combination of art and science, cartography. To have something that\u2019s beautiful to look at but also an object you can look at and think, \u2018Oh, I used to live near here\u2019 or \u2018I want to go there\u2019 and so on. It\u2019s part of the beauty of mapping, the shared experience.\u201d A kind of magic, as John Dee understood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
