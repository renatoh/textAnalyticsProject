Asked whether he was looking forward to playing against Harry Kane in Wednesday\u2019s World Cup semi-final, the Croatia defender said: \u201cHe is one of the best strikers in the world but I like to challenge these strikers and to show to everyone that I am one of the best defenders.\u201d Rewind to 22 October at Wembley, and there are 31 minutes on the clock. Lovren glances to the technical area and sees his number being held up. Kane has already got away from Lovren twice, running in behind to score Tottenham\u2019s first goal and leaving the defender in his wake to set up a second. Lovren looked lost and disoriented. \u201cAmbling about like a man recently winched up off the anaesthetist\u2019s table,\u201d Barney Ronay wrote . It was uncomfortable to watch. Lovren had strayed into that territory where a player becomes a danger to his own team and J\u00fcrgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager, had to act. His words after the match felt as damning as the decision to sub Lovren so early. \u201cIf I am involved in this situation on the pitch, then Harry cannot get the ball,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t happen if I was on the pitch \u2013 but I am in the middle of the technical area in trainers.\u201d Lovren is a better footballer than he showed that day and although his time at Anfield has been far from straightforward, by the end of the season it seemed as though the balance had tipped to the point that the good outweighed the bad. Even his biggest critics at Anfield would acknowledge he enjoyed an impressive Champions League campaign, forming a fine centre-back partnership with Virgil van Dijk. Either way Lovren has learned to live with the flak. There is a story he tells about his childhood and how, when he was 12 years old, he wrote under the table at his apartment in Croatia: \u201cOne day I will be one of the best defenders in the world.\u201d People ridiculed him at school, said he \u201ccould not play like a defender\u201d, lacked pace and was one-footed. Lovren used that as for motivation. There is no shortage of self-belief burning within him. But even at the age of 29 doubts persist \u2013 in Croatia as well as on Merseyside \u2013 about Lovren\u2019s consistency and that nagging feeling there could be a blunder round the corner. It feels strange that a player who has spent the past eight years in the top flight in France and England, being transferred for the best part of \u00a335m while moving from Dinamo Zagreb to Southampton to Liverpool, has represented his country 44 times. He has rarely been a mandatory pick for Croatia and if Vedran Corluka, the former Spurs defender, had not been plagued by injuries Lovren might well have begun this World Cup on the bench. But Lovren has started every game with the exception of the final group match against Iceland \u2013 when Croatia were already through to the last 16 \u2013 and only Luka Modric has played more minutes than him here. Not only that but Lovren has acquitted himself well. He has made more clearances and blocks than any other Croatia player, and only Ivan Rakitic and Modric have racked up more passes. Yet, steady as Lovren has looked, it would be understandable in the context of his battles with Kane last season \u2013 the striker also scored at Anfield in the corresponding fixture \u2013 if there were some concerns at the back of the defender\u2019s mind. Publicly at least Lovren insisted he was relishing that prospect and gave the impression that he was more concerned about England\u2019s threat from set pieces. \u201cLook at the players \u2013 the smallest is about 6ft 3in,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cEngland are one of the favourites to win the World Cup and you have to respect that. But we enjoy to play against big teams, as we showed against Argentina, and have nothing to lose.\u201d Vukojevic sent home by Croatia over Ukraine comments Croatia have sent Ognjen Vukojevic home from their World Cup delegation after the former international appeared to make pro-Ukraine comments in a video. The video, posted after Croatia beat hosts Russia in the quarter-finals on Saturday, shows defender Domagoj Vida alongside Vukojevic. Vida shouts \u201cglory to Ukraine\u201d before Vukojevic, who has travelled with the side as an observer, adds \u201cthis win is for Dynamo [Kyiv] and Ukraine \u2026 go Croatia.\u201d The video angered many in Russia, which has tense relations with Ukraine and annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. The Croatian football federation and Vida have apologised for the video. Both the centre-back and Vukojevic previously played for Dynamo Kyiv, and Vukojevic is now a scout there. Fifa rules prohibit players from making political gestures at the World Cup and the governing body gave Vida a formal warning on Sunday but did not impose a match sanction. Vukojevic said he intended the video as a personal greeting to Ukrainian friends, not as a political statement. \u201cHowever, I do understand that my statements can be differently interpreted,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of this, I am sorry\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
