The demand was made in a recording posted on the internet with a picture of Johnston's BBC identity card. Johnston, the only foreign reporter based in Gaza, was kidnapped on March 12. Palestinian officials have said that he is safe although no evidence has been given. In its statement, the Islamic Army asked Britain to release Sheikh Abu Qatada and asked other \"infidel\" countries to release Muslim prisoners. \"We say to all of them, free our prisoners or we will do the same to you,\" the statement said. \"We won't make an exception. If you need money to release our prisoners, we will give you all you need up to the last dirham we have.\" Abu Qatada is a Jordanian who has been detained without trial in the UK as a threat to security, pending possible deportation to Jordan, where he as been found guilty of terrorism offences. The Islamic Army was one of the three groups that claimed responsibility for the abduction of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit last year. The group split from the Popular Resistance Committees last year. It is believed to be led by Mumtaz Dogmush, the leader of a large Gaza clan. Experts believe Johnston was taken as leverage in the clan's dispute with Hamas, who led the abduction of Shalit. The dispute is believed to be partly financial and partly the consequence of an armed clash between the two groups which left two members of the Dogmush family dead. The BBC said it was aware of the tape and studying its contents."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
