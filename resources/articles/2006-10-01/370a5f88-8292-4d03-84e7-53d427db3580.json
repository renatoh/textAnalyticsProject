Longstanding Franco-German tensions provoked the latest crisis at EADS, the parent group of Airbus, exposing the transformation of the planemaker in just a few months from a triumph of European commercial and technological superiority into an enterprise fighting for its survival. \"Airbus is the most successful aircraft manufacturer in the world. Europeans can be proud, and look their tormentors in the eye. Their system works,\" said Will Hutton as he hailed European cooperation in Airbus a a triumph in his book The World We're In. But this week Christian Streiff, the company's short-lived chief executive ousted after barely 100 days in the post, admitted the Airbus he found was years behind Boeing in bringing new planes to market and could need a decade or more to catch up with its American rival. Airbus has easily outsold Boeing for four years, but now the US company has overcome its own internal crises and threatens to regain supremacy for years to come, maybe even a quasi-monopoly in large commercial aircraft. The conundrum facing the French and German leaders is stark, according to insiders. It rests on whether they can put aside their destructive national interests and agree on a unified executive structure at EADS - including a single chief and chairman - that will enjoy their confidence and trust and serve both countries' needs. This will prove challenging, especially as other countries now want to be involved. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, said this week he wanted to increase the 5% stake held by a Russian state bank and, more critically, the Russian influence within the EADS leadership. An earlier demand was rebuffed by the EADS board because of the shareholders' pact which enshrines joint control between the French and Germans. Spain's economy minister, Pedro Solbes, also says his government wants to increase the 5.4% stake held by a state holding company and secure a greater influence than its one, non-voting seat on the board to safeguard thousands of Spanish jobs. Manfred Bischoff, EADS German co-chairman, will merely countenance a rise in non-state interests. But this new tussle for national power pales against the continuing battle between France and Germany, who between them control 45% of EADS. Several German ministers have indicated they want KfW, a German state-owned institution, to acquire a holding in EADS explicitly to counter French influence. The French have openly speculated on increasing their control - the Chirac government backed the doomed attempt by Noel Forgeard, then Airbus chief executive, to appoint himself the single boss of EADS last year. Mr Forgeard is widely seen as the architect of the EADS/Airbus fall from grace. He was ousted in July after failing to report on and control production problems at the A380 that caused a two-year delay in deliveries and a \u20ac4.8bn (\u00a33.2bn) profits hit. But for insiders, Louis Gallois, the new Airbus chief executive who will also continue as EADS co-chief executive, could be the catalyst for restoring that grace. \"There's a completely different feeling since his appointment. He may be French, but the Germans have sufficient trust in him to represent their interests as well. Streiff was too strident in demanding autonomy at Airbus and holding a gun to the EADS board while lacking political adeptness,\" a source said. Mr Gallois, a former ministerial adviser who turned around state railways SNCF, now has to integrate Airbus fully under EADS control. The group acquires total ownership of Airbus this week when the purchase of BAE Systems' 20% stake is completed. But he must also prepare the way for the group to be a pan-European company free of state interference. Tom Enders, his German co-chief, and Mr Bischoff, who shares the role of chairman of EADS with French media group head Arnaud Lagard\u00e8re, have indicated they want EADS to be wholly owned by free-floating shareholders, with a single chief executive and chairman chosen regardless of nationality. But that may not happen for at least three years, insiders say, and requires a \"coordinated dance\" between the French and Germans. Meanwhile, Mr Gallois has to implement the \u20ac2bn annual cost-savings plan bequeathed by Mr Streiff who, in interviews this week, identified the formal dual-nationality split in both production and management as a root cause of the Airbus crisis. Under his \"Power8\" plan, overheads would be cut by 30% and productivity increased by 20%. It would involve thousands of job losses, perhaps as many as 10,000, and plant closures. Mr Gallois says drastic measures are required to offset the 41% decline in the dollar over the past six years. It is an open secret EADS is considering moving production to countries such as China, India and Russia - and the US. He says the issue of Airbus's 16 European plants will be decided in the new year and the burden of any closures and job cuts will be shared. But the Germans are already angry about threats to transfer most A380 production from Hamburg to Toulouse and reports that four or five German plants could close. Radical outsourcing overseas would raise the political heat. His task - restoring Airbus's reputation and integrating it into a unified EADS structure of corporate governance - is colossal. Recent pan-European mergers among companies such as Vodafone-Mannesmann or Anglo-Dutch steel group Corus show how cultural differences can destroy value. Many think turning EADS/Airbus into a \"normal\" group by overcoming six years of political clashes may prove a task too far."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
