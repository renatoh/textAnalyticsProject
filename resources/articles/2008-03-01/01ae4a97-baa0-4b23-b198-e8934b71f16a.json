Ferraro, of course, said - and said, and said, and said - that Barack Obama's race gave him a distinct advantage in this campaign. Her comments pulled off the difficult-to-achieve trick of being simultaneously unserious and utterly toxic, and she has rightly (if too grudgingly) been banished by the Clinton camp. But like a lot of idiots whose mouths get too far out in front of their brains, she has, in an accidental and backward sort of way, stumbled onto something that we haven't discussed very much in this campaign and likely will not discuss: Is it all right for Obama supporters to back him in part because he's black? This isn't the same thing as his race being an advantage for him, which was Ferraro's argument. Overall, it's completely impossible to think that in this country, as much as it has changed in the last 40 years, being black could be more advantageous than being white while seeking the presidency (or a cab, or a tender, respectful glance from a stranger, or many things). But what about the people, African-Americans and white liberals, for whom his race is a positive factor? Are they - oh what the hell, let me just declare myself; are we - allowed to say that the fact that he could become the first black president is one of the things we very much like about the man? This certainly isn't supposed to be said on television. If you're an American and have been watching the Ferraro fallout over the last three days, you've seen that the position of proper moral rectitude is that race should not be \"injected\" into the campaign in any way. Television morality holds that any mention of race is verboten and demands that people say no, his race isn't a factor, they're supporting him because of his excellent plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or what have you. It most definitely isn't supposed to be said by black people. As I noted in a column in Monday's print paper, while Hillary Clinton can say she'd be proud to be America's first woman president, Obama can't say the same thing about being America's first black president; the white establishment would go ballistic. By the same token, black supporters of Obama, whenever they're interviewed, understand that they're not supposed to say to the white press that they back Obama because of his race. They know that they're supposed to say they're for him because they think he's the best person for the job. Many of them may and probably do believe this of course. But even the ones who are essentially for Obama because he's black have to pretend that isn't the case. (In contrast, women don't have to lie in this way about their support for Hillary, because female solidarity isn't nearly as threatening to powerful white people as black solidarity.) Well, I'm not on television and I'm not black, so I am here to say that yes, the fact that Barack Obama is a black man is an important factor on his behalf. There is no earthly reason that it should not be. This country has a history on the question of race with which you may be familiar. The idea that we might elect a black president would indeed in my mind help redeem that hideous legacy, and it would change our present in a million small ways that would benefit the whole society. He'd be an incredible role model for young black men, and, assuming he was even a reasonably successful president, a better role model for old white men who didn't believe an African-American could do the job. His election would also - far, far more than the election of another war-mongering white man, and yes, even considerably more than the election of a woman - send an unimaginably powerful message to the rest of the world, where most of the people are darker than most Americans are by this shade or that. I recently had occasion to meet some intellectuals in Santiago, Chile - writers, professors, journalists and so on. They were not, as far as I could tell, bleeding-heart libs. They were mostly quite down on Chile's socialist president, Michelle Bachelet, as an incompetent. But all they wanted to know about from me, with bated anxiety and hope, was Obama. Could he win; could America really elect a black man; was it really possible? (Their views on Hillary? As divided as Americans' are, especially - predictably - the women.) If they feel that way, I reckon their counterparts in most countries of the world probably feel that way. The election of a black American president would arrive as an earthquake around the world. It might even persuade the good citizens of a country or two that, if America could manage to do that, then maybe they could overcome some discomforting piece of their own past. Of course, he must meet certain requirements and hew to certain standards that we have a right to expect of anyone who wants to lead the country. Of course, he must prove that he can withstand the rigours of a tough campaign. Of course, he must demonstrate that he can get white votes and is electable. And of course, his race can't be the only or even the chief basis of support. He needs to have touched a nerve and described a vision for the country that people find compelling. Whatever his various shortcomings, he has quite obviously done that. Whether he's met the terms of my first three \"of courses\" is something the voters are still sorting out. That's as it should be, and he may yet come up short on one or more of those fronts. But in sum, there are all sorts of legitimate reasons for Americans cognisant of their country's history to hope specifically and unapologetically for the election of a black president. The rules of our political discourse won't permit much discussion about it, and someone whose political imagination is as reactionary and desiccated as Ferraro's can't see it. But if you're a liberal or a black person, or both, and you feel at all like I do, I'm here to tell you it's all right. We just may need to keep it between ourselves.
