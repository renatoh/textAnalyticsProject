A report by the Institute for Science and International Security alleged that a joint commission set up to implement the Vienna deal had allowed Iran to keep more than the agreed maximum of 300 kg of low enriched uranium (LEU) by excluding waste material in Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. If enriched further, LEU could be used in a nuclear warhead. The institute\u2019s director and co-author of the report, David Albright, said that this and other exemptions were granted by the commission in secret. \u201cOne of the biggest problems is we are being denied information in these cases,\u201d Albright said. \u201cIf the joint commission has so many powers to change this deal, shouldn\u2019t we know what they\u2019re doing?\u201d The state department denied that the 300 kg LEU limit set down in the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA), had been breached. \u201cThere\u2019s been no loosening of the commitments and Iran has not and will not under the JCPOA be allowed to exceed the limits that are spelled out in the JCPOA,\u201d spokesman John Kirby said. He added the only violation of the terms of the deal had been a temporary surplus in Iran\u2019s export of heavy water (which can be used in nuclear reactors to produce plutonium), but that had been corrected. Kirby also said the secrecy of the work of the joint commission, which represents all parties to the deal, was stipulated in last year\u2019s deal, signed by six world powers (the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China), the EU and Iran. \u201cThis is in compliance with the JCPOA which says the commission\u2019s work should be confidential unless all parties agree otherwise,\u201d Kirby said. However, while he repeatedly stated there had no been \u201cno exceptions\u201d to the quantitative limits set down in the agreement, Kirby did not respond directly to the question of exemptions. Albright\u2019s report claimed certain waste products and residues were not being included in the joint commission\u2019s inventory of nuclear materials. Kirby said he would not \u201ctalk about the specific work of the joint commission\u201d As well as noting the heavy-water surplus, Albright\u2019s report said that \u201clab contaminant\u201d containing 20% enriched uranium was being overlooked by the commission, and that Iran had been allowed to retain 19 \u201chot cells\u201d larger than the specifications laid down in the JCPOA. Hot cells are special containers that allow technicians to handle radioactive matter with special gloves while being shielded. They can be used to separate plutonium from spent fuel on a small scale. Kirby noted that the joint commission was given the authority to approve larger hot cells than envisaged in the agreement. \u201cWe aren\u2019t saying anything has been violated here,\u201d Albright said. \u201cBut the number of these hot cells is surprising. We don\u2019t know how many are being monitored by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency], and again, why is this secret?\u201d Jim Walsh, an international security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that it was the norm for arms control agreements to have secret sections. \u201cSecret doesn\u2019t mean evil. It\u2019s just standard operating procedure, and as this report says itself, Obama notified Congress. Congress has known this from the beginning,\u201d Walsh said. On the question of the \u201chot cells\u201d, Walsh added: \u201cThe report admits these are being used for producing medical isotopes. There is no plutonium reactor in Iran. A reactor is years away, so allowing the existing hot cells is not a proliferation danger.\u201d James Acton, the co-director of the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: \u201cThe more complicated and comprehensive your arms control agreement, the more questions it throws up in implementation. \u201cUnder the Chemical Weapons Convention, the US had to destroy its stockpile by 2012, but it wasn\u2019t possible to meet that deadline. People didn\u2019t see that as an attempt to undermine the convention, and a pragmatic solution was found,\u201d Acton said. \u201cThere is the same principle at work here.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
