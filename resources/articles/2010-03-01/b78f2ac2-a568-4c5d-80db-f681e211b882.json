By telling the Conservative party conference of his plans to slash inheritance tax, the shadow chancellor effectively torpedoed Gordon Brown's plans for an early general election. In his new book, The End of the Party, Andrew Rawnsley records how Mr Osborne's speech in Blackpool was watched in Labour headquarters in Victoria Street by two of Gordon Brown's inner circle, who immediately grasped its potential significance. \"That's it,\" said one. \"We can't have an election.\" No matter that this tax cut would put money into the pockets of only the richest; the election date was duly knocked back by three years \u2013 and the formerly-Iron Chancellor became Bottler Brown. So one can see the appeal for the Conservatives of today's announcement of a cut in national insurance. It comes just a few days after Alistair Darling's budget \u2013 which was notably short on tax-and-spend doorstep pleasers \u2013 and on the morning of the chancellors' debate on television. Fewer than 40 days before an election, the opinion polls are narrowing and Tory activists are in need of red meat. Bingo! What is more, this cut is consistent with previous Conservative attacks on national insurance as \"a tax on jobs and on the many\". This attack may also stir Labour's folk memory \u2013 after all, the \"tax bombshell' that sunk John Smith's shadow budget in 1992 was a rise in national insurance. That said, there is a big difference between autumn 2007 and spring 2010, and it can be summed up in two words: banking crisis. The credit crunch, the economic meltdown and the fiscal damage left behind means that any tax cut or spending pledge has to pass intense scrutiny. David Cameron is well aware of this, which is why just last month he told reporters: \"It's not possible to go into this election with lots of lovely plans for tax cuts. If you're going to announce a tax cut, you've got to show where the money is coming from.\" And on that front, Mr Osborne's plan fails to satisfy. He promises his partial cut in the government's proposed rise in national insurance on employees and employers (worth in total around \u00a37bn a year from 2011) will be funded not by a tax rise anywhere else, but by cutting public spending. Except the Tories' tough talk on reducing government spending has yet to be matched with anything like the same detail. Indeed, last Friday Mr Cameron promised to safeguard pensioners' free bus passes, TV licences and winter-fuel payments \u2013 a package of spending worth \u00a34bn a year, and which a party leader eager to rip into the deficit would seek to reduce (by means testing, say). So the credibility of this latest policy should be questioned; but it also raises the issue of political consistency. Ever since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Tories have focused their attention almost exclusively on the spiralling public debt. Yet here they are, just a few weeks before an election, offering the traditional vote-winner of a tax cut. Mr Osborne can claim that cutting national insurance might enable companies to hire more staff and thus kick-start the economy\u2013 and at the margins that is probably true \u2013 yet that implies he finally buys Labour's line that growth is the best way to bring down the debt. None of this is to deny the sheer attention-grabbing potential of a tax cut, especially on middle- and lower-earners. But looking back, Mr Osborne's conference-pleasing rabbit in 2007 was better tactics than strategy; it worked primarily because it forced Labour to defer the election, but it was also a policy millstone that the Conservatives have had to bear in the middle of the ensuing economic crisis. This time, the election is only weeks away \u2013 the only thing to be decided is the parties' credibility. What may once have been a guaranteed vote-winner might now look like a not-so cheap trick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
