But he is still a boy, so the unexpected invitation by some less good boys to a downtown party with the promise of \u201cmad females\u201d (hot girls I think) is irresistible \u2013 to the extent that when Naz\u2019s ride falls through he nicks his dad\u2019s yellow cab (this is New York). It \u2013 the night of The Night Of (Sky Atlantic) \u2013 will be a big one, the biggest of Naz\u2019s life. The night starts badly, relatively. He doesn\u2019t know where he\u2019s going, or how to switch on the cab\u2019s off-duty light. People get in, he politely asks them to get out \u2013 Naz K ain\u2019t no Travis B, it would appear. Things look up when a \u201cmad female\u201d gets in and asks to be taken to the beach. Now it doesn\u2019t seem to matter so much that Naz isn\u2019t going to make the party. They don\u2019t get to the beach, but to the river, by a bridge, where they pop pills under a full moon. Then they go back to her beautiful brownstone for tequila shots, cocaine, the knife game (a bit like Russian roulette only with knife and hand on table instead of gun against temple). And sex. But the best night of Naz\u2019s life soon turns into the worst when he wakes, blurry-headed, in the early morning to find her dead, with multiple stab wounds. Naz remains free for a while, but is then picked up for a traffic offence (another wrong turn, at a junction, in his life \u2013 understandable in the circumstances). Lovely, doe-eyed Naz is now chief, and only, suspect in the murder of Andrea Cornish (she only gets a name posthumously). Suddenly so much that has come before \u2013 CCTV at the tunnel, a garage stop, an unpleasant encounter on the street \u2013 takes on enormous significance; what seemed like random events, part of Naz\u2019s night out, now look like a big pile of evidence against him, in court. DNA isn\u2019t doing him any favours either. Or the knife in his pocket. The Night Of has moved on from procedural crime drama to something more about the randomness of justice, with a lot of the brilliant first series of the Serial podcast about it (the fact that Naz is from a Pakistani-American family adds to this). The sharp-eyed television addict will also recognise that it is based on the first series of the BBC\u2019s also brilliant Criminal Justice, written by Peter Moffat. But Richard Price and Steven Zaillian\u2019s adaptation, taking in a new city, new prejudices, post-9/11 Islamophobia etc, more than justifies its existence and makes it a thing in its own right. A very excellent thing. With a hypnotic performance from Riz Ahmed as a young man whose world is closing in on him, doors slamming with metallic clunks. Excellence, also, from Bill Camp as the weary cop in no doubt about whodunnit; and from John Turturro as the scruffy, scratchy (he has eczema) just-about-a-lawyer who appoints himself to Naz\u2019s defence and who we\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of as this gets into the legal nitty-gritty. A Guardian moan: that the one major female character is horribly and graphically killed off, less than half an hour in. It gets a bit better, with Naz\u2019s mother, who will become a bigger and stronger as this goes on; also the prosecutor and other female lawyers. And did the racist outburst (\u201cdid you leave your bombs at home, Mustafa?\u201d) have to come from an African American, who also happens to be a big-time weed enthusiast? Hmmm, objection slightly sustained, though there are also African Americans who are neither racists nor stoners, like the excellent traffic cop (also, undeniably, a woman, though, also undeniably, a relatively minor character). Moans over. The Night Of looks stunning. Is there maybe a little nod to Scorsese in this opener, nighttime Manhattan lights at taxi cruising speed, windscreen reflection, rear-view glances, Ahmed a 21st-century De Niro? There\u2019s a zooming in and out focusing thing going on \u2013 are you lookin\u2019 at this right here, or that back there? \u2013 that is utilised to the limit (OK, I got a little weary of it). But it adds to the feeling of dazzled confusion when a frightened young man is suddenly caught in the headlights on the road to hell. Is Naz innocent, though? We know stabbed her once, even if she was egging him on, in knifey-foreplay. And he was on a cocktail of unfamiliar class As. Could he have done it in a crazy drugged-up frenzy, and then forgotten about it? Or not forgotten about it ... One thing I do know: I\u2019m hooked."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
