Not so Oxford, in respect of its dealings with Rafsanjani junior, whose father, currently head of Iran's expediency committee, arranged the mass murder of thousands of leftish students in 1988. It appointed the insider Peter North, its former vice-chancellor, to undertake an inquiry as to why Rafsanjani fils was relieved of the requirement to speak the Queen's English and even to reside in Oxford. The university claims the North inquiry found no evidence of \"impropriety on the part of the admitting tutor\". But since it refuses to release the North report or even the name of the admitting tutor, this is not very satisfactory. Perhaps the solution is for the chancellor of Oxford to leak the North report to the chairman of the BBC trustees, since the occupant of both offices is the Tory poobah Chris Patten. He is always harping on about transparency. \u2022 Yes, trying times, because, as we know, master Rafsanjani is also being pursued over a Canadian high court judgment requiring him to pay \u00a33.7m to a business rival he is accused of torturing back in Tehran. They can't find him in Oxford, of course, because he is not required to live there. The Canadians have sent the papers to the university, and it's worth noting that in reply Oxford said it did not know \"what status a default judgment in a civil Canadian court has in the English legal system, or in the university's regulations\". Confusing to the layman. But doesn't it have a law faculty to unravel that sort of thing? \u2022 A shout out, meanwhile, to Dr Ita O'Donovan, a veteran public servant who has known the highs and lows of life in the front of municipal administration. She was assistant chief executive in Newham, east London, in the late 90s, when the borough's social services were placed into special measures \u2013 though it should be said that social services didn't fall within her area of responsibility. Onward to Stoke on Trent, where she was city manager, the most senior official between 2002 and 2006. In 2006, just after her departure, the government declared children's services so bad in Stoke that a taskforce was sent in to run them. Onward once more to Haringey, north London, where she was chief executive at the time of the Baby P scandal. An unlucky run, to be sure, and no doubt undeserved; so one hopes that these days things are less eventful. Public Servant magazine notes that one of her tasks now is explaining the mayoral system to former guerilla leaders in Kosovo. \u2022 Competence alert! For Big Dave said he would publish the government accounts, with assets and debts, as part of the open government initiative. And by heck, he did it. Just four weeks ago, the team that pulled the stats together was feted and given an award. But the devil is in the detail. For we learn from the site Exaro News that when the national audit office took a good look, it damned the award-winning operation for \"not complying with international financial reporting standards\", \"inconsistent applications of accounting standards\" and deficiencies that meant \"significant assets and liabilities\" were left out of the financial statements\". These included all the accounts of state-owned entities such as the Royal Bank of Scotland and Network Rail. So it looked good but it wasn't, really. After one giant leap, we are not much further forward at all. \u2022 Isn't this, finally, the strangest situation? Five days now since we asked the department for communities and local government to tell us whether Eric Pickles, the secretary of state, would indeed be starring at the training camp being run by the kooky rightwing Young Britons' Foundation at St Anne's College, Oxford. The group whose officials holds such wacky views on health and punishment that the Tory hierarchy has been keen to distance itself. Perhaps he doesn't like to talk about it, but he should call anyway if only to put our minds at rest. Use a pay-phone.
