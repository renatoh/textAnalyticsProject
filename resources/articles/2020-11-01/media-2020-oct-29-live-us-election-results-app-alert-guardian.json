What is it? When results start coming in on Tuesday evening, we\u2019ll send one mobile alert that will automatically update with the latest national vote count data over the course of the night. Without a tap, a search or the opening of an app, you can follow the vote tally and key developments live on your phone\u2019s lock screen. (That\u2019s the screen on your phone when you\u2019re not actively using it.) This alert will be one of the fastest ways to receive election results on Tuesday and beyond. Since we don\u2019t know how long it will take to count the votes this year \u2013 whether it will be hours, days or weeks \u2013 the election alert will keep counting until the election is called by the Associated Press, though you can minimize it any time. How do I sign up? The alert is available free worldwide on both iOS and Android devices to anyone who downloads the Guardian\u2019s mobile app. If you\u2019re in the US: If you already have the Guardian app and you\u2019re signed up to breaking news notifications in the US, you don\u2019t need to do anything \u2013 you\u2019ll automatically receive the live election alert.
