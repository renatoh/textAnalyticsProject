The Portugal midfielder was signed as a late \u00a311.7m replacement after Javier Mascherano left for Barcelona last summer. Given the uncertainty that surrounded the club under the then-owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, there was an informal agreement to review his terms if his first season in English football proved successful. Meireles has been a regular starter under both Kenny Dalglish and Roy Hodgson, scoring five goals in six games shortly after the managerial change, although he is likely to miss the final game of the season at Aston Villa on Sunday, due to a hamstring injury suffered in the recent 5-2 win at Fulham. Despite the Liverpool hierarchy being overhauled since his arrival, Meireles's agent, Jos\u00e9 Caldiera, expects the informal agreement to be honoured by Fenway Sports Group and the player is keen to extend his stay on Merseyside. \"If I had this opportunity I'd sign a new contract today. [For] 10, 20 years, for sure,\" he said recently. The former Liverpool striker Fernando Torres, meanwhile, wants the club's sports therapist, Ivan Ortega, to join him at Chelsea. Ortega moved to Liverpool from Celta Vigo in 2009 and worked closely with Torres during the Spaniard's final injury-plagued seasons at Anfield. It is understood the striker has asked Chelsea to offer a position to Ortega as he looks to rediscover the form and fitness that has eluded him since his \u00a350m transfer to Stamford Bridge in January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
