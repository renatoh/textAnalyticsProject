Ask an England cricketer and he says, 'Why?'\" That soon changed. Stewart's work-ethic gave England a sense of purpose not seen for years. He found them in blazers, with methods which had barely changed since the 1950s, and left them in tracksuits. A former professional with Charlton Athletic as well as Surrey, Stewart, \"knew what it was to prepare thoroughly\" according to his first captain, Mike Gatting. David Gower was bored by the new physical jerks but only Duncan Fletcher rivals him as a moderniser. Key quality Moving with the times Keith Fletcher, 1992-1995 \"The gnome\" was as much a landmark of county cricket in the late 1970s and 80s as the Scarborough festival, the blond mullet and the championship pennant flying over Chelmsford. As captain and then coach of Essex, Fletcher won six titles in 14 years. However a man who admitted that he had \"never relaxed when playing Test cricket\" was perhaps not steely enough to deal with a difficult England dressing room. They won only a single series in Fletcher's three years at the helm; sacked, he returned to Essex and his beloved vegetable garden. But no coach before or since had his knowledge of the players on the county circuit. Key quality County knowledge Ray Illingworth, 1995-1996 Cussed, curt and canny, Illingworth's almost-mystical reputation as a master strategist was compromised during his year as England's first \"supremo\". As coach and chief selector his word (and he was seldom short of one) went, despite the captain's view; a precise inversion of his philosophy when he had captained England himself in the 70s. Characteristically, he told Graeme Hick he had a \"soft centre \u2014 and it's because you had a molly-coddled upbringing\". Others saw his ideas as catastrophically outmoded, notably his increasingly frustrated captain, Mike Atherton. Illy won two of his 11 Tests, a smaller proportion than any other England coach. However, even Atherton admitted his brilliance as a strategist during a Test. Key quality Reading a game David Lloyd, 1996-1999 The Mr Motivator of England coaches, the genial Lancastrian inherited a disparate set of individuals whose main loyalty was to a county. He bequeathed a more united Team England. Lloyd disapproved of tinkering with techniques; at Test level players should have worked that out already. Instead he tried to create a warm atmosphere in which players would blossom. He also took up the administrative burden \u2013 no longer did the captain have to order the baseball-mits for practice. He won 26% of his Tests, far better than Stewart (21%), Fletcher (19%) or Illingworth (18%). Key quality Enthusiasm Duncan Fletcher, 1999- 2007 Before Fletcher the country was split into two types of people: those who thought English cricket was in crisis, and employees of the ECB. Fletcher achieved what no other coach had \u2013 he made England a winning side. No one comes close to his 42% of Tests won. He was helped by central contracts, excellent technical knowledge (he transformed England's play against spinners), a subtle man-management style, and by Nasser Hussain, the fire to Fletcher's ice. Even Atherton, an arch-sceptic about the impact of coaches, called him \"outstanding\". Key quality Professionalism Peter Moores, 2007-2009 Following Fletcher was hard; dealing with injuries to key men harder; and coping with Kevin Pietersen's scorn harder still. A subtle judgment of Moores will have to wait for the revelatory biographies, but on the face of it he struggled. Batsmen such as Alastair Cook seem to have stagnated, players murmured about paralysis by analysis, and results were mediocre \u2014 he beat only New Zealand and a dreadful West Indies. His one definite positive is that he wasn't intimidated by egos. And that was his undoing.
