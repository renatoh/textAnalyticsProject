Peter Jarvis, the 'independent' non-executive chairman, sits on the company's 'bid' committee, which is considering whether to accept takeover approaches from rival private equity groups. But Jarvis, in my view, cannot be described as independent as he becomes eligible for a \u00a3220,000 pay-off if the company undergoes 'a change of control'. Why an independent executive chairman should be eligible for any sizeable pay-off after a takeover is beyond most people's comprehension. But fund managers have rightly pointed out that Jarvis has a conflict of interest in that he stands to gain personally if a deal goes through. On that basis, Jarvis should do the decent thing and step down from the bid committee. In Debenhams we have a perfect example of why the Higgs report went to such lengths to draw up comprehensive guidelines to ensure that non-executives are truly independent. And there is more to the story. Corporate governance dictates that the chair of the remuneration committee be held by an independent non-executive director. Jarvis chairs Debenhams' remuneration committee, but his own pay package resembles one usually reserved for executive directors. Non-executives should be paid a pre-determined salary, not awarded one-year contracts, complete with company perks. Higgs would act as a brake in situations such as the one at Debenhams. The report is emphatic that everything should be done to make certain that chairmen are viewed as independent; something that is amiss in the case of Jarvis. Bland under pressure at BT I would not like to be in Sir Christopher Bland's shoes at the moment. As chairman of BT, he felt the heat last week when the company's stockbroker Cazenove lowered its rating of the group's share price prospects. One can only speculate about secretive Cazenove's thinking, but the story probably goes something like this: the easy cost-cutting measures - such as cutting staff numbers - are almost completed. That has concentrated minds on what the future holds for BT. Ten years ago, the concept of 'convergence' meant that everyone thought fixed-line telephones, mobiles and computers would eventually converge to produce one small terminal conveying everything from TV to email. But what we have today is open warfare between those companies that should, in theory, be converging. Cable operators, mobile phone and technology firms are competing for customers in a market where there are too many suppliers and insufficient demand. That depresses prices and cuts margins: good for consumers, but bad for shareholders. BT is on a losing wicket because punters will increasingly use their mobiles, or other media, for simple telephone calls, or data communications of one sort or the other. To turn things around, Bland and his chief executive Ben Verwaayen, need to come up with new business initiatives and projects to boost revenue. They have made a start, but there is a very long way to go. No wonder Cazenove is getting edgy. BSkyB's still got its eye on the ball Shares in BSkyB have fallen to earth since the heady days of early 2000 when they broke though \u00a320. On Friday, they were trading at under \u00a37, and have underperformed the FTSE-All Share index by 10 per cent in the last three months. The problem of late for BSkyB is that 'fear' appears to have got the upper hand as investors are fixated by the possibility that the satellite operator may lose some of the rights to broadcast live Premiership football. They are getting their knickers in a twist for no good reason. The League's recent decision to divide the live rights into three separate packages, each containing a certain number of games, is an attempt to appease the concerns of competition commissioners in Brussels. BSkyB could still bid for all three packages, however, if no one else was interested. From what I hear, the most that will happen is that BSkyB, which is 29 per cent controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, will launch a joint bid with the BBC for part of the live action. That shouldn't be a problem for BSkyB, providing it still gets the best of the crop. But the real point here is that there is less competition around these days, which means that BSkyB's chief executive, Tony Ball, will almost certainly end up spending less on securing the rights than last time. A few years ago, it looked as though BSkyB could see its grip on live sport weakened by the likes of cable operator NTL, BT and even ITV - remember ITV Digital. Today, those companies are struggling financially. BSkyB has little to worry about, and I would wager that the shares will rally in the weeks ahead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
