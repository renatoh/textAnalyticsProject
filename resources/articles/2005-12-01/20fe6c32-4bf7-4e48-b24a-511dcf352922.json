Analysts said the strong management team put in place by Mr Packer, headed by his son James, had limited the impact of his death on the share price. \"You would expect it to be down, and for there to be some kind of reaction, but this is a fairly muted one,\" BT Financial portfolio manager, Peter Davidson, told Associated Press. \"It's a reflection on the quality of management, the team that is in place at the moment, that the share price is not giving way.\" Rupert Murdoch, who was both business partner and rival to Mr Packer, led the tributes to the late media mogul. Mr Murdoch described Mr Packer as \"one of the most successful businessmen of his generation.\" \"He had an uncanny knack of knowing what people were thinking and this finely-tuned antennae made him one of the best media proprietors and broadcasters this country has seen,\" he added. \"He was a man who you could truly say was larger than life, a fierce competitor who had friends in areas of great influence and was often surrounded in controversy but at the same time, capable of great generosity.\" Analysts and fund managers played down the likelihood of a quick break-up of the A$11.2 billion ($8.2 billion) media and gaming group built up by Australia's richest man. Mr Packer had in recent years given increased control of the business to his son James, who is reported to be less committed to the television business than his father. But analysts said he was unlikely to sell the top-ranked Nine Network in the short-term, particularly as it is still restructuring after a challenge to its ratings dominance by Seven Network. The late media mogul's business empire spanned magazines, television, ski resorts, cinemas, petrochemicals, heavy engineering, diamond exploration and cattle ranching. He inherited his father's television and magazine business in 1974 and expanded it to become Australia's richest man. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
