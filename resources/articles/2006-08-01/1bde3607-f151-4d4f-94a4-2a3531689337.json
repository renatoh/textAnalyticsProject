Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said the Indian government had been asked to withdraw the diplomat. 'He was found involved in activities incompatible with his diplomatic status,' she said, using a phrase usually reserved for spying. She identified the diplomat as Deepak Kaul, a consular official at the Indian High Commission in Islamabad. Grab for Nepali king's land Land owned by Nepal's King Gyanendra may be confiscated and handed to poor farmers, a minister said, in the latest move to remove the monarch's privileges after street protest forced him from power. Having already lost control of the army, being unceremoniously dumped out of his legislative roles and facing the prospect of a tax bill, the sovereign now finds the government eyeing his property. Uganda rebels stand down Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army rebels declared a unilateral ceasefire with Ugandan troops ahead of peace talks due to resume in south Sudan this week. 'The ceasefire was declared by Lieutenant General Otti on behalf of the LRA's leader Joseph Kony and takes immediate effect,' an LRA spokesman said. In the air tonight ... A young Dutch architect has created a floating bed that hovers above the ground through magnetic force and comes with a price tag of \u20ac1.2m (\u00a3810,000). Janjaap Ruijssenaars took inspiration for the bed - a sleek black platform that took him six years to develop - from Stanley Kubrick's 1968 cult film 2001: A Space Odyssey. Magnets built into the floor and into the bed itself repel each other, pushing the bed up into the air. Thin steel cables tether the bed in place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
