Four years ago, on 16 June 2015, after Trump had slowly descended a golden escalator to the basement of his eponymous New York tower, he clambered on to a makeshift stage and began his announcement speech. \u201cWow. Woah. That is some group of people. Thousands!\u201d Trump said, looking out towards a bank of TV cameras. Except that\u2019s not how people who were there remember it. \u201cThere were a few dozen people lining the area leading down to the escalator, and then there were a couple dozen downstairs where the event actually took place,\u201d said Alana Wise, who covered the campaign launch for Reuters news agency. \u201cThat kind of frenetic energy that we got later on,\u201d Wise said, \u201cit just wasn\u2019t there.\u201d Trump\u2019s misinterpretation of the number of attendees kicked off what would be a surreal afternoon, as the businessman set off on an offensive, angry speech, the nadir of which saw Trump accuse Mexico of sending \u201crapists\u201d to the US. The rhetoric worked: he was soon at the top of the Republican polls. But it\u2019s a sign of how Trump\u2019s candidacy was viewed that covering his campaign wasn\u2019t seen as a particularly senior gig. Wise said: \u201cI was an intern at Reuters at the time. It was one of my first assignments out of the office.\u201d In the days following Trump\u2019s announcement, it emerged that the Trump campaign had paid people $50 to attend the event. \u201cWe are looking to cast people for the event to wear T-shirts and carry signs and help cheer him in support of his announcement,\u201d read the casting call. Wise, now a reporting fellow for WAMU radio\u2019s Guns and America project, remembers it being an unusual audience. \u201cThere were some people who lived in the building who had come down, and then there were just a lot of people just kind of from off the street who had come in to see it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot of just random curiosity happening.\u201d Charlotte Alter was far from a veteran political correspondent when she covered Trump\u2019s launch. In 2015 she was a junior reporter for Time magazine, keen to get involved in coverage of the presidential election. \u201cI, at the time, was a very junior reporter and I was based in New York. So in some ways sending me was \u2026 they were kind of throwing me a bone, I think.\u201d At Trump\u2019s later campaign rallies he would play music by the Rolling Stones, Queen and Neil Young \u2013 each of whom asked him to stop doing so. But at the campaign launch, he took a different tack. Alter, who co-wrote Time\u2019s story with then political correspondent Alex Altman, remembers The Music of the Night, from Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s Phantom of the Opera, being blasted on repeat while journalists waited for Trump\u2019s descent. Before the speech, Trump\u2019s fledgling campaign staff had circulated planned remarks, Alter said, but Trump quickly went off script. \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best,\u201d Trump said, as he claimed the country was dispatching immigrants to the US. \u201cThey\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us [sic]. They\u2019re bringing drugs, they\u2019re bringing crime, they\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d Trump was best known internationally for his hair, TV show, and proclaimed wealth. In the US, however, he had been waging what many saw as a racist \u201cbirther\u201d campaign against Barack Obama for years, falsely claiming the then president had been born in Kenya. But even for close Trump watchers, the speech represented new extremes. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody came away from that announcement thinking he was going to be the next president. But it was clear immediately afterwards that his talent for getting attention was going to serve him well,\u201d Alter said. For Heather Haddon, then a political reporter at the Wall Street Journal, one of the surprises was that Trump had finally done it. The president likes to insist that 2016 was the first time he had run for office, but as far back as 1988 he had flirted with running, and he ran for the Reform party nomination in 1999. \u201cDefinitely the sense was \u2026 there\u2019s no way this guy is going to make it,\u201d Haddon said. As for the event itself, Haddon remembers there being an \u201calmost pro-wrestling\u201d tone to the announcement. \u201cIt was angry but it was also so matter-of-fact,\u201d said Haddon, who now covers business at the Journal. \u201cIt just seemed so stream-of-consciousness. Going from one topic to another, things that might, I guess, excite people, set people off. It was all just sort of spewed out there.\u201d The speech set a precedent for the freewheeling addresses Trump made throughout his campaign, and has continued to make in the White House. \u201cI think everyone just left there shocked,\u201d Haddon said. The Guardian dispatched business reporter Rupert Neate to Trump Tower. Neate, who is British, remembers that colleagues at the time didn\u2019t think it was \u201cparticularly a big deal\u201d, but recalls then being stunned by the content of Trump\u2019s speech. \u201cI thought, if it was Britain and someone was to come and say all those extreme things, you\u2019d think it was sort of like a far-right, extreme-slash-jokey candidate, and there\u2019s no chance he\u2019s ever going to win this,\u201d Neate said. \u201cBut look how wrong that assumption would be.\u201d Trump is due to launch his re-election campaign Tuesday in Orlando. This time, there really will be thousands in attendance, but whether they will leave with as vivid memories as those who witnessed the 2015 launch remains to be seen. Alter, now a national correspondent for Time, has written extensively about US politics in the past four years, but said she often thinks of that June afternoon in 2015. \u201cAt the time \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s still there \u2013 there was a Trump ice-cream parlor,\u201d she said. Behind the counter was a man who told Alter he was from Mexico. Alter didn\u2019t use him in the story, she said, uncomfortable about whether it could affect his job or immigration status, but she had \u201cthought a lot\u201d about him since. \u201cThis was the speech where Trump said the thing about Mexicans as rapists. And 40ft in front of him, behind all the cameras there is a guy from Mexico, almost certainly an undocumented immigrant, scooping ice cream for Trump banana splits, wearing a hat that says Trump ice cream on it,\u201d Alter said. \u201cIt was just so interesting to me that literally, you know, Trump is speaking to this crowd and there are all these cameras, and then behind the cameras, behind the crowd, in his line of vision, there\u2019s this guy standing directly in front of him, who is a perfect example of all of the sort of contradictions at work in this campaign.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
