Collective responsibility has long been suspended, as shifting groups of ministers and backbenchers pursue their own favoured Brexit outcome. But the chaotic votes of Wednesday night smacked of a government falling apart. First, six cabinet ministers most notable for their leadership ambitions \u2013 Gavin Williamson, Jeremy Hunt, Alun Cairns, Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Sajid Javid \u2013 supported the Malthouse compromise, a policy that would involve junking the deal their own government had spent two years negotiating. And then a separate group of cabinet ministers, David Mundell, Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke, abstained in the face of a three-line whip, rather than vote against the amended motion taking no deal off the table. Sources close to the group later claimed that when ministers gathered for an informal cabinet meeting shortly before the votes, neither the chief whip, Julian Smith, nor Theresa May herself were aware of the risk of a defeat. The European Research Group\u2019s Jacob Rees-Mogg later called for the abstainers to resign or be sacked. \u201cCollective responsibility requires ministers to support government policy or to resign. It is a basic constitutional point,\u201d he said. Several more junior ministers opted to vote for the motion, in defiance of the whips. One, Sarah Newton, a junior minister at the Department for Work and Pensions, immediately resigned. A grim-faced Smith was spotted shortly afterwards on the corridor next to the whips\u2019 office, consulting with May\u2019s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell. The PM\u2019s chief Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, who last month let slip in a Brussels bar her plan of presenting MPs with the alternative of backing her deal or facing a long delay to Brexit, was seen leaving parliament 45 minutes after the vote. The language of both sides has become increasingly strident, as the deadline for leaving the EU has approached. One MP described the prime minister\u2019s deal during Tuesday\u2019s debate as a \u201cturd\u201d. The Brexiter Bernard Jenkin responded to Wednesday\u2019s fresh humiliation for the government by blaming \u201canti-Brexit MPs\u201d, and calling it \u201ca sad day for democracy\u201d. Mark Francois, one of the cabal of Brexiter backbenchers who have made themselves freely available to commentate on the prime minister\u2019s travails in recent days, insisted on Sky News: \u201cI was in the army; I\u2019m not trained to lose.\u201d Ben Bradley, the Brexiter MP for Mansfield who voted for May\u2019s deal, said: \u201cWe have just betrayed the promise we made to the electorate. I am angry, quite emotional to be honest. \u201cIt is incredibly difficult to justify that we said we were going to leave on the 29th. Parliament just said we are not going to leave, effectively. I think tomorrow we will vote to extend article 50. \u201cThis is the reason I voted for the deal yesterday, because I thought this was going to happen today. But I am just shocked that it has and I\u2019ve just seen ministerial colleagues come out of that lobby voting to take no deal off the table to prevent us from leaving. \u201cThe trust in government is evaporating. We have got to the point where if cabinet ministers can\u2019t vote for a long-term government position on Brexit on a three-line whip they have to go, frankly. If May doesn\u2019t [sack them] I think we are in total freefall.\u201d Bradley added: \u201cThe prime minister needs to lead, frankly and show that there are consequences for defying the whip.\u201d Simon Clarke, another Brexiter, said he was \u201cangry and bewildered at having a gun to my head for a wretched deal. There was real anger in the house tonight \u2026 it is galling beyond words.\u201d George Freeman, who abstained on the amended motion, defying the government\u2019s orders, said the party was heading for a general election. \u201cWe lost three MPs last month, we lost 30 MPs in the last election. This is only going in one direction and we need to start to prepare for that,\u201d he told the BBC. Despite the thumping defeat of the Malthouse compromise, which was rejected by a majority of 210 votes, the ERG\u2019s lieutenants appeared unbowed. Steve Baker urged the prime minister not to bring back her deal for a third meaningful vote in the coming days. One ERG MP, Andrew Bridgen, said May could still ignore parliament and pursue a no-deal Brexit. On the ministers who abstained, he said May \u201cshould have sacked them weeks ago\u201d. Also clearly evident as Wednesday\u2019s chaos unfolded was the horror with which some Conservative MPs view the damage inflict on the reputation of their own party by the Brexit crisis. The junior minister Sam Gyimah asked the environment secretary, Michael Gove, who wound up the debate for the government, \u201cthe overwhelming view of business is that no deal should be taken off the table. \u201cGiven that those of us on the government benches know that the success of our party and our country is based on backing the job creators and the wealth creators, how does he think the Conservative party of the 1980s would look at our response to business at the moment?\u201d When David Cameron suspended collective cabinet responsibility at the outset of the EU referendum campaign, he fondly imagined his colleagues could all be brought back together again a few weeks later. But almost three years on, the bitter divisions opened up during that campaign have solidified and the Conservative party is now divided into fiercely opposed tribes. When Anna Soubry quit the Tories last month to join the breakaway Independent Group, she warned that, \u201cthe right wing, the hardline anti-EU awkward squad that have destroyed every leader for the last 40 years, are now running the Conservative party from top to toe. They are the Conservative party.\u201d Some of her more remain-minded colleagues, perhaps partly emboldened by the departure of Soubry and two other Tory MPs, are now fighting back \u2013 and the result has been civil war."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
