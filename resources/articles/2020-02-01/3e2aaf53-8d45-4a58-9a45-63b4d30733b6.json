Much of the history of modern Australia can be traced to a single building. The barracks has sat on Macquarie Street in Sydney since 1819, when it was first built to house and regulate convicts. Across the 200 years since then, the barracks has been the place where stories of colonisation, Aboriginal resilience and free immigration have all come together. And in 2020, there\u2019ll be a new way to step into that rich history. Prisoners\u2019 Barracks, Hyde Park, 1836. Image: Robert Russell, National Library of Australia, nla.obj-135277601. On February 21, Hyde Park Barracks will reopen after a 12-month closure as an entirely different museum experience. The exterior of the UNESCO World Heritage-listed building will be the same but \u201ceverything on the inside will be different,\u201d says Sydney Living Museums, Executive Director, Adam Lindsay, who is leading the renewal alongside New York-based design company, Local Projects. While telling the incredible history of the site will remain core to the new museum\u2019s mission, the way visitors experience it will radically change. Instead of \u2018traditional\u2019 museum displays, the new barracks has opted for experiential and emotionally-charged exhibits that give visitors an immersive understanding of what life was like for its early residents. The way the museum approaches its history has changed, too. \u201cWe wanted the museum to have an opinion,\u201d says Lindsay. \u201cLike Australia, the barracks has a complicated and contested history and we\u2019re ready to talk about it.\u201d Importantly, that means the renewed barracks will not shy away from early Australia\u2019s shameful treatment of Indigenous people. \u201cThe Aboriginal story is interwoven into this museum experience. This is not a museum where First Nations\u2019 stories and perspectives are relegated to one special little room,\u201d Lindsay explains. In fact, one of the museum\u2019s standout exhibits, named Frontier Violence, is dedicated to the Myall Creek Massacre, in which 11 serving and former convicts and one free settler murdered a group of Aboriginal people \u2013 eventually being brought to trial and found guilty in a landmark case. \u201cThe effect of the barracks and colonisation generally on Aboriginal populations was profound,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe cost of building this nation was Aboriginal land and culture.\u201d In fact, in uncovering stories of loss and dispossession, the new stories in the barracks also reveal Aboriginal resistance and ongoing cultural resilience. The Frontier Violence exhibit, is dedicated to the Myall Creek Massacre. Visitors will also get to learn about what life was like for the 50,000 convicts who came through the barracks from 1819, just a few decades after the start of colonisation. Lindsay is keen to point out there is no singular convict experience: \u201cThey were all human beings, here for different crimes and different lengths of time. There are so many stories: sad, happy, prosperous, opportune. Really, there was no typical story.\u201d So to illustrate the range of convict experiences, the museum has used archival records and a collection of over 4,000 personal items (pipes, clothing fragments, coins and gaming tokens) as the foundational basis to bring different stories from that period to life.

While conditions for those early convicts weren\u2019t as bad as some might think \u2013 they were \u201csurprisingly well fed,\u201d Lindsay says \u2013 life at the barracks certainly got nicer from 1848, when it became a depot for female immigrants. It still \u201cwasn\u2019t lavish,\u201d but the shift to an immigration depot changed the barracks \u201cfrom a place of punishment to a house of protection and assistance\u201d, largely for young women and girls from Ireland who came here fleeing famine. Then, from 1862, the space was used for what was termed an \u2018asylum\u2019, but is better thought of as refuge for vulnerable women. \u201cIt really was a home for sick, destitute and homeless women; women who\u2019d been widowed, women who may have had mental illnesses or suffered from alcoholism and none had family support, \u201d Lindsay says. Importantly, he adds, \u201cit was the birthplace of social welfare for this colony\u201d and the first evidence of the state stepping up to take care of those in need. The redesign of the museum interweaves all these different threads of Australian history \u2013 and the experiences, both good and bad, that it was home to \u2013 so that visitors experience them in tandem. Jake Barton of Local Projects, who worked on bringing the museum renewal to life, explains. \u201cEvery visitor will see different events or landscapes or moments in time from multiple points of view.\u201d Meet the convicts - experiential museums immerse us in our past. Eventually, the barracks stopped serving as an asylum and became a space for courts and ministry buildings, before being converted into a museum in the 1990s. But its impact on the development of Australian society lives on. \u201cYou can only get the cornerstone foundational story of the lived history of Australia right at the barracks, and that makes it something so incredibly special,\u201d Barton says. \u201cThis is the only place you can come to truly understand that history and to feel it in the building where it was born.\u201d Adam Lindsay agrees. \u201cIt was the very epicentre of the colony, of the longest running prisoner transportation system in history. So it\u2019s the foundation of absolutely everything; of modern Australia itself. The convicts who came here are the people who built this place. And the effects that had on Aboriginal communities and the future of this country, [means that] it will never be the same.\u201d \u201cReally, the very formation of modern Australia as we know it started at Hyde Park Barracks.\u201d Book your visit to the reimagined Hyde Park Barracks."}, "isHosted": false}}}
