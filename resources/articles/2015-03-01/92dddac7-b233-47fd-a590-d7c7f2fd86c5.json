Speaking shortly after helping Great Britain into the quarter-finals of the Davis Cup \u2013 against France in July, possibly at Wimbledon \u2013 the world No4 turned his attention immediately to the Tour and his own arrangements. In recent weeks, he has bemoaned the lack of backup on his coaching staff. Mauresmo is committed to 25 weeks of the season, leaving several gaps in his busy calendar. \u201cOver the next few days I\u2019ll try to arrange something, to do a trial period in the next month or so,\u201d he said. \u201cAm\u00e9lie is next not with me at the beginning of the clay-court stretch [which begins in Monte Carlo on 13 April]. I get married the week after Miami [which follows Indian Wells]. I\u2019m not 100% sure what I\u2019m going to do the week after that. It depends what happens in the next month or so.\u201d Murray reflected on a magical weekend for British tennis while remaining cautious about the future. He hopes the Davis Cup victory in Glasgow that has catapulted Great Britain back into the quarter-finals for the second year in a row is not wasted in another round of good intentions. However, in the immediate aftermath of the team\u2019s 3-2 win over the USA, he made it clear he wants some positive evidence before he will accept that more words will not disappear on the wind, as they have many times before. Shortly before Murray went out to beat the Americans\u2019 best player, John Isner, in three tough sets to put the tie beyond doubt, he spoke briefly to the Lawn Tennis Association\u2019s chief executive, Michael Downey, who outlined the British governing body\u2019s plans to increase playing numbers. \u201cI spoke to him for, like, 15 minutes,\u201d Murray said. \u201cHe took me through a one-page plan, a strategy, in terms of how they were going to get more people playing the game. I haven\u2019t given my opinion or thoughts on how that should be done. I just listened to what he had to say. \u201cGetting more people playing is obviously important. The more people we have playing, the more chance we have to get more top players but it\u2019s one thing saying it, putting it down on a piece of paper. It\u2019s another thing doing it, actually following through with it. We\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d Murray said the spirit that flowed from the 7,700-capacity crowd in the Emirates Arena was heartening and emotional, going a long way to helping the team win. \u201cI think it\u2019s valuable. You see the enthusiasm and the passion that people clearly have for tennis right now. That\u2019s great. It\u2019s up to the LTA to capitalise on that. That\u2019s not my job. \u201cI\u2019m just happy that when we\u2019ve been able to play the big events of the last few years the crowds have been absolutely fantastic every time. Again, in the summer, I\u2019m sure we can fill another big arena but we need more than just putting these sort of events on. It\u2019s the LTA\u2019s job to capitalise on the interest that\u2019s around just now.\u201d While dashing across several time zones to California to pick up on the next leg of the Tour may be arduous, Murray might have been happy for a quick exit after accidentally inferring that his Davis Cup team-mate Dominic Inglot had met a new girlfriend in Glasgow. After the gaffe, filmed on Eurosport, Murray hurried from the scene, stooped at a right angle, with head in hands, face reddening by the second, a daft postscript to the team\u2019s triumph. Inglot told reporters on Monday he had explained to his girlfriend of six months in London how the incident was a wind-up that went wrong. As the Guardian understands it, the new \u201cgirlfriend\u201d was someone who had formed a unreciprocated crush on the outgoing doubles player. Speculation about the quarter-final, meanwhile, rumbles on. Contrary to some rumours, no venue has been decided. The LTA will consult with the team captain, Leon Smith, as well as the players before making their choice by the early April deadline."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
