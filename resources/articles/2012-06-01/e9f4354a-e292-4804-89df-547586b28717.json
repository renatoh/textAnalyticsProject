Dustin Hoffman's baleful window-bothering at the end of The Graduate! The otherwise inexplicable chart success of Angry Anderson's \"Suddenly\"! The \"Bridezilla\" phenomenon has gained such quarter in recent years that it's almost eclipsed the truth: it's not just the lady in white \u2013 weddings drive everyone insane. Understandably. What kind of monster wouldn't be discombobulated by a day that starts with ritualistic ceremonial activity conducted by a bloke in a dress, followed by two pints of cava and a 4pm \"breakfast\", and ends with you voguing to Dexys Midnight Runners in a function room, avoiding the busy hands of someone's whisky-sodden uncle? Not me, reader. Which is precisely why this week's column tackles the perpetual poser of what to wear to a wedding. If the aforementioned trials must be borne in the name of love, deciding how to dress shouldn't be an additional ordeal. Start with the invite. Unsure about the dress code? Let this be your guide. If it specifies black tie (or white), your parameters are clear. If not, it should still give you a few clues. A formal/traditional style of invite will usually denote a wedding with a similar atmosphere. After the invitation, consider the location: outdoors or in? Hot or cold? Will you be on your feet for hours? Flats or wedges will tackle lawns, cobbles and country lanes with relative ease. Try these LK Bennett wedges or pop these metallic Topshop ballet pumps in your bag. Black or white is best avoided, even if you think the rule about wearing neither is silly (it really isn't about you, after all). Try soft grey if you're scared of colour. This Asos Curve dress is beautiful and goes up to a size 22. Lace is this summer's big trend, and is perfect for weddings. Try this pink Josa dress from Whistles. Maxis (like this emerald one from Wallis) suit hotter climates and look cool with jewelled flats. If you're allergic to dresses, what about these Warehouse floral-print trousers with a simple top and a long necklace? Hats require nerve, but if you're brave enough, go for it. You will increase the gaiety of the event considerably. I'm rather taken with this Balle de Match cloche hat by Jill Courtemanche. My top tip, however, is to wear something old if you can. A day steeped in sentiment is perfect for old favourites. It's a happy memory for them to accumulate and means you won't turn up in the same shift as three others. Plus, if you're saving on a one-hit-wonder frock, perhaps you could live happily ever after with a \"for ever\" accessory like this Anya Hindmarch clutch.
