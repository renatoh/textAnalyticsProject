Do not blame the judges. They accept and acknowledge the absurdity of the system. The fault lies with politicians who think that the whole world can be run like rival shops competing in the high street. Mr Justice Bean - sentencing Network Rail after its conviction for allowing the breaches in safety procedures that led to the Paddington rail crash - accepted that \"every pound they are fined will be one pound that cannot be spent on railway safety\". Then he fined the company \u00a34m. Judge Richard Bromilow - punishing Bath's Royal United hospital for \"blatantly ignoring safety guidelines\" that would have prevented a lethal outbreak of legionnaires' disease - observed that limited funds \"have to be prioritised\". Then, imposing an \u00a380,000 fine with \u00a323,000 costs, he required the hospital's finance director to reduce the priority given to improving hygiene by giving financial precedence to paying absolutely pointless legal bills. The fines were absolutely pointless for the obvious reason that they will not touch the guilty individuals. Not a penny will be deducted from the remuneration of Network Rail directors. And anybody who believes that, shamed by the public exposure of failure, they will change their ways, cannot have made a recent railway journey. The \u00a34m will be either recouped from a reduction in investment on improved infrastructure, or passed on to the train-operating companies. They, in turn, if recent behaviour is any guide, will pass it on to the travelling public. The same objection applies to the fine imposed on the Royal United hospital. Does anybody really believe that it will be a deterrent to other hospitals that might, otherwise, neglect to clean their shower-heads? Only two incentives encourage improved performance in the public sector. One is the effect of individual assessments on personal prospects. The other is vocational commitment. And the greatest of these is vocational commitment. A financial penalty - which is essentially the sanction of the market system - can have only one result. The consequent reduction in spending power that makes it more difficult for the hospital to improve its service to the public. Making things worse has become a major feature of government penal policy. By sending so many offenders to overcrowded prisons - where they can be neither reformed nor rehabilitated - it creates more criminals rather than reduces their number. But there is the devout belief, among the floating voters, that prison works. And the floating voters have to be propitiated. That can hardly be the reason for the corporate fines. They must be the result of the most deranged extension of the prime minister's fantasies about the importance of markets. In the dream world, the miscreant company would be forced (by the imposition of a fine) to put up its prices, while its competitors (which have not behaved badly) would have no legal costs to absorb. So they would offer a cheaper product, and the rogue firms would lose business while their virtuous rivals gained custom. Not even the Adam Smith Institute imagines that such a situation is likely to result from fining Network Rail. Nor are the citizens of Bath likely to take their illnesses and accidents elsewhere because of the penalties imposed on their local hospital. Some may realise it will have \u00a3103,000 less to spend on hospital care. But, as Alfred Marshall said, perfect competition requires perfect knowledge and perfect choice, and the Royal United's potential patients possess neither of those advantages. And a good thing too. If, fearful of the problems reduced incomes will create, they were to boycott their local hospital, the health service in Somerset would be in chaos. So how are needless tragedies - a recently recovered leukaemia patient dead from legionnaires' disease and 31 passengers killed by neglect of proper maintenance - to be avoided? The answer is that some sectors of the economy have to be treated not as units in the marketplace but as services. The ethos of care and commitment has to be encouraged in place of the absolute reliance on the incentive of high rewards. The neglect of that imperative lies at the heart of all the government's troubles with the public sector. comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
