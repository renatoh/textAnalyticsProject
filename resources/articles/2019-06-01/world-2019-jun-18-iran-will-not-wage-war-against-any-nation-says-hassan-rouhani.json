The US move, announced by the acting defence secretary, Patrick Shanahan, comes after the US blamed Iran for attacks on two oil tanker ships last week, which has raised fears of a confrontation, and Tehran declaring it had increased its rate of uranium enrichment. Shanahan said the troop deployment was for \u201cdefensive purposes\u201d, citing concerns about a threat from Iran. \u201cThe recent Iranian attacks validate the reliable, credible intelligence we have received on hostile behaviour by Iranian forces and their proxy groups that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region,\u201d he said in a statement. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, replied on Tuesday that Iran had no desire for conflict. \u201cIran will not wage war against any nation,\u201d Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state TV. \u201cThose facing us are a group of politicians with little experience.\u201d He added: \u201cDespite all of the Americans\u2019 efforts in the region and their desire to cut off our ties with all of the world and their desire to keep Iran secluded, they have been unsuccessful.\u201d The US released more photographs on Monday to support its claims that Iran was responsible for attacks on commercial tankers in the Gulf of Oman. One of the pictures appeared to show in colour and sharper focus an incident that had previously been presented in a grainy black and white video \u2013 a patrol boat with black-uniformed sailors alongside one of the tankers, the Kokuka Courageous. A statement accompanying the images said the incident was filmed from a US helicopter and occurred after blasts had hobbled the two ships on 13 June. The crew of the Kokuka Courageous had spotted an unexploded mine on the hull and abandoned ship. \u201cLater that day, an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Gashti Class patrol boat approached Kokuka Courageous and was observed and recorded by a US navy MH-60R helicopter removing the unexploded limpet mine from Kokuka Courageous,\u201d said the statement issued by US Central Command. \u201cIran is responsible for the attack based on video evidence and the resources and proficiency needed to quickly remove the unexploded limpet mine.\u201d The statement does not make any claim on why the Iranians removed the mine, for example in an attempt to remove evidence. The US has not presented any evidence of mines being attached, and the head of the company operating the Kokuka Courageous, Yukata Katada, has said the crew had reported that the ship was attacked by a \u201cflying object\u201d. On Tuesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is also due to visit the Florida headquarters of US Central Command (in charge of all operations in the Middle East) and US special forces. It is unusual for a secretary of state to visit military headquarters, especially as the acting defence secretary is reported to be staying in Washington. Pompeo has taken the lead role in the administration\u2019s campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran, since the US withdrawal from a multilateral nuclear deal in May last year. Tehran on Monday announced it would soon breach limits on how much enriched uranium it can stockpile under the nuclear deal. The accord, which was brokered by Barack Obama and which Iran and the other signatories have maintained following Trump\u2019s withdrawal, caps Iran\u2019s stock of low-enriched uranium at 300kg enriched to 3.67%. But Iran said it had quadrupled the rate of enrichment, so that in 10 days it would bypass the 300kg limit. A spokesman for the White House national security council said this amounted to \u201cnuclear blackmail\u201d. Morgan Ortagus, a spokeswoman for the state department, told reporters on Monday: \u201cWe continue to call on the Iranian regime not to obtain a nuclear weapon, to abide by their commitments to the international community. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that they have made this announcement today. It doesn\u2019t surprise anybody and this is why the president has often said that the JCPOA [joint comprehensive plan of action] needs to be replaced with a better deal.\u201d The US decision to pull out, and Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to foreign policy, appears to have damaged trust with allies, some of whom are seeking stronger proof that Iran was behind the oil tanker attacks. Critics accuse the Trump administration of manufacturing a crisis. Ben Rhodes, former national security adviser to Barack Obama, tweeted: \u201cTrump pulling out of the Iran deal has led directly and predictably to the Iranian nuclear threat getting worse and the risk of war going up.\u201d On Tuesday, China urged restraint, saying the US risked \u201copening a Pandora\u2019s box\u201d in the Middle East. State councillor Wang Yi said \u201cthe US side should alter its extreme pressure methods. Any unilateral behaviour has no basis in international law,\u201d and warned it could create \u201can even greater crisis\u201d. Wang also urged Iran not to abandon the nuclear deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
