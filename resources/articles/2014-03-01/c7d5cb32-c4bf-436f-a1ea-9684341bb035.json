Ban art exports", "bodyText": "The Van Dyck self-portrait that the National Portrait Gallery wants everyone to turn out their pockets for is a remarkable painting. It is arrestingly beautiful. The painter's appraising glance locks on to the observer. The slashed silk doublet is sumptuously seductive. This little-known masterpiece \u2013 although it had never left Britain, it had never been on permanent public display either \u2013 was picked up at Sotheby's in 2009 for \u00a38.3m by a dealing partnership, which bought the picture for three times its estimate, and then set about inflating its value, to resell at a profit. They established it as the self portrait that was still in possession of the artist \u2013 Charles I's court painter \u2013 when he died in 1642, within a year of painting it; that it also belonged to Sir Peter Lely, his successor at court, and was key to perpetuating the great Van Dyck insight, that it's all about celebrity. Thus hyped, it was sold for a 50% mark-up to Bernie Ecclestone's art-loving son-in-law in the US. So far, so orthodox. But a temporary export ban was slapped on it, and this week, with \u00a33.6m so far raised to keep it in Britain, the purchaser pulled out. The dealers have now brought the price to the National Portrait Gallery down from \u00a312.5m (excluding VAT) to \u00a310m. A heartening tale insofar as it goes, but in the oligarch age, sales of such trophy art are booming. Public funds for culture have been slashed. Britain, whose richest citizens have often been great patrons of the arts, can no longer compete. It's time to tear up the export rules and hang on to what we've got. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 March 2014 to clarify that it is the National Portrait Gallery, not the National Gallery, which has launched a fundraising campaign to buy the Van Dyck self-portrait."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
