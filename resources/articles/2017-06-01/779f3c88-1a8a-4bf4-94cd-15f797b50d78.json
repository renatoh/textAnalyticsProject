The memes included jokes about pedophilia, child abuse, sexual assault, and the Holocaust. One message referred to a Mexican youth being hanged as \u201cpi\u00f1ata time\u201d. The memes were shared as part of a private Facebook chat where admitted students in the class of 2021 shared edgy jokes as part of a \u201cjust-because-we-got-into-Harvard-doesn\u2019t-mean-we-can\u2019t-have-fun kind of thing\u201d, an admitted student told the Harvard Crimson. The paper quoted a number of students from the incoming class, who had a range of responses, including two who said it was the right approach to withdraw the offers. \u201cI do not know how those offensive images could be defended,\u201d one student said. At least two Harvard professors, however, questioned the decision to withdraw the offers. Alan Dershowitz, an emeritus professor at Harvard Law School, told the Guardian that losing admission to Harvard was a \u201cdraconian punishment\u201d for \u201cvery bad taste jokes that students were sending to each other\u201d. \u201cIt sounds like Harvard is intruding too deeply into the private lives of students,\u201d said Dershowitz, who has represented a series of high-profile clients, including OJ Simpson. \u201cIt may affect them for life,\u201d Dershowitz said. Harvey C Mansfield, one of Harvard\u2019s most outspoken conservative professors and the author of a book called Manliness, also told the Guardian he questioned the decision. \u201cThe bounds of what is offensive have been extended and distorted, and I no longer trust the bent judgment of politically correct enforcers.\u201d A spokeswoman for Harvard University declined to comment on the report. \u201cWe do not comment publicly on the admissions status of individual applicants,\u201d Rachael Dane wrote in an email. The official Facebook page for students admitted to join the Harvard Class of 2021 warns students that \u201cHarvard College reserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission under various conditions including if an admitted student engages in behavior that brings into question his or her honesty, maturity, or moral character\u201d. Dershowitz said this guidance was too vague to provide students with any real understanding of the school\u2019s expectations. \u201cWhen you punish a student seriously without articulating standards, I think it raises questions,\u201d he said. While Harvard, as a private college, is not legally bound to respect the first amendment within its walls, it has long upheld the principle of free speech, Dershowitz said. \u201cThis is just the kind of awful, awful speech the first amendment is designed to protect,\u201d he said. The Tab, a news site run by university students, published what it said were screenshots of the memes. A member of the Facebook group chat, whose name was not included in the piece, told the Crimson that the Harvard applications committee emailed students who were part of the group in mid-April, asking them to submit a statement \u201cto explain your contributions and actions for discussion with the Admissions Committee\u201d. A week after that, \u201cat least ten\u201d members of the group received letters rescinding their offers of admission to the class of 2021, the source told the Crimson. Last year, a previous group chat for admitted Harvard students sparked a public condemnation from university officials after the chat included racist jokes. The university would not comment on how many students who are admitted to Harvard have their offers of admission rescinded in a typical year. Meme-sharing Facebook groups have become a new college tradition, Mic reported last week, with students across the country trading inside jokes and fighting battles with rival universities via screenshot and caption. The names of some of these public Facebook groups, Mic reported, were \u201cHarvard Memes for Elitist 1% Tweens\u201d, \u201cUCLA Memes for Sick AF Tweens\u201d, \u201cUSC Memes for Spoiled Pre-Teens\u201d and \u201cUChicago Memes for Theoretical Midwest Teens\u201d. The private Facebook group chat that led to offers of admission being rescinded was named, at one point, \u201cHarvard memes for horny bourgeois teens\u201d, the Crimson reported."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
