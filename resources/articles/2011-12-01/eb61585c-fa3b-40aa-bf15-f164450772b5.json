Show owner and celebrated grumpy judge Simon Cowell chose to focus this year on his American projects; teenage contestant Frankie Cocozza was thrown out for an alleged sex-and-drugs romp; and veteran judge Louis Walsh confessed to having restored his vanishing hair at a reported cost of \u00a330,000. A significant percentage of the former audience also defected, giving unexpected ratings victories to the rival pre-Christmas wannabe franchise: the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing. But on Sunday night at 9.22pm, there was an advance. Little Mix, a girl band concocted during the qualifying rounds from four soloists, became the first group to win the competition. After a pause lasting around 40 seconds \u2013 hammy even by the tension-extending conventions of wannabe shows \u2013 presenter Dermot O'Leary revealed they had beaten 23-year-old Liverpudlian hairdresser-turned-singer Marcus Collins in the public phone vote. The female foursome's cover version of Damien Rice's song Cannonball will now slug it out to be Christmas number one with Gareth Malone's choir of military wives, created for a BBC reality series. Bringing together personnel from Essex and north-east England, Little Mix \u2013 comprising Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Perrie Edwards and Jade Thirlwall \u2013 had also inadvertently contributed to the fractious atmosphere on this year's X Factor, forced to change their original name, Rhythmix, when it turned out to clash with the title of a children's music charity. And despite the suggestion their victory would be a triumph for \"girl power\", the singers were consistently addressed as \"you guys\" by their mentor on the show, N-Dubz member Tulisa Contostavlos, and by the presenter. O'Leary, his voice audibly raw from two nights of shouting above a crowd of 10,000 in Wembley Arena during the two-part final, also seemed to be somewhat dyspeptic about the series. He described the two final acts as \"best in show\", a metaphor drawn from dog shows, and declared at 7.30pm, as the programme began: \"This is the end of an incredibly long journey.\" For the TV audience, it was also the beginning of one. In an X Factor final, roughly 30 minutes of necessary content \u2013 the two finalists singing, the vote being announced \u2013 is swollen to two hours in order to allow maximum time for lucrative phone-voting and space for the advertisers who want to be part of the grand finale: Beckham scent, supermarkets' recession-busting seasonal meal offers and albums by guest stars in The X Factor's last show, including Coldplay and Michael Bubl\u00e9. A consoling fact for the loser, though potentially ominous for the winner, is that defeated finalists in the past \u2013 including JLS and One Direction, both chart-topping acts \u2013 have often done better than some who took the Cowell crown; Leon Jackson and Steve Brookstein spring to mind. Having finally claimed a victory for a group over a soloist, Little Mix will be hoping they can reverse this curse. During one of the laborious breaks that delayed the final announcement, viewers were invited to compete for tickets for The X Factor live tour by completing the song lyric \"I'm walking on \u2026\". The options were a) sunshine; b) eggshells; c) water. Although signed to ITV1 for two more seasons, The X Factor has given the sense this year of walking on eggshells, tangibly missing irritable Cowell syndrome and becoming prone to off-screen distractions. The latest of these is a report that Ofcom may investigate alleged breaches of product placement rules by participants in the series. The regulator may also have blanched last night when judge Kelly Rowland wished the audience a \"happy freakin' Christmas\", an American euphemism for a taboo TV word. Once crowned with their prize of a recording contract with Cowell, the winners were invited to perform their single live. They broke down with emotion and were unable to carry on. The song, however, continued without them: a neat symbol of both the show's reliance on manufactured sounds and its capacity to continue in the face of problems. But this year The X Factor has consistently given the impression it may not be far from becoming an ex-show."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
