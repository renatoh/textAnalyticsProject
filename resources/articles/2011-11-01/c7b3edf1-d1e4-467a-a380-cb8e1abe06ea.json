The Manchester United forward is appealing against his suspension for all three group games but even if partially successful Rooney is still likely to miss the opening two. Bent, who has scored four goals in his 12 internationals, was asked if he would like to continue to audition. \"I hope so. It's about what you do for your club side now and as long as I can keep playing well for Aston Villa and the next friendly for England \u2013 if I can get picked for that squad and do well, hopefully I will be there.\" That match is in February against Holland, who lost to Spain in the 2010 World Cup final, and will provide a further test following England's 1-0 win over Sweden on Tuesday evening and the 1-0 defeat of the world champions on Saturday. Bent, a second-half substitute against the Swedes, was left out of Capello's squad for the last World Cup but he played down suggestions that he has stated a strong case for inclusion at Euro 2012. \"Who knows? You can always do better. \"But at the same time I'm happy with how things are going at the moment. And as long as I keep playing well for my club side and keep getting in Fabio's side then I will be happy,\" said the 27-year-old, who scored in last month's 2-2 draw in Montenegro that secured qualification and has kicked off his domestic campaign with five goals in 10 appearances. One of Bent's competitors for a berth in Capello's squad is Bobby Zamora, who made his first start for England against Sweden. \"He did well,\" Bent added. \"You know what Bobby is about. He is strong, a target man, and I thought he did really well.\" He believes the squad now has momentum following the two wins. \"You don't get much better than Spain on Saturday and Sweden are playing well. We haven't beaten Sweden for 40-something years so it's nice to put one over on them. At the same time they caused us problems but I thought we dealt with it and deserved to win the game. Momentum is built by winning games and playing well. And at the moment we are doing that and we have to build on it. \"We could have sat back after the Spain game and patted ourselves on the backs and said, 'we have beaten them so that is it.' But we didn't. It's always nice to go into games with confidence. At the same time there is still a long way to go and I'm sure the Euros will be a different case. But as long as we keep winning games and playing well then that's all that matters. I'm sure Fabio has got the answer up his sleeve. \"We have played against two completely different teams and come through the test. It's going to be difficult but we are going into the tournament full of confidence and we can't wait to get going.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
