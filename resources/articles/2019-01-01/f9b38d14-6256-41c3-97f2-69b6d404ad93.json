The former Argentina manager sees little wrong with snooping on opponents and right now this combination of coaching and reconnaissance seems unbeatable. Bielsa has led Leeds to the top of the Championship where they stand five points clear of second-placed Norwich and 11 ahead of sixth-placed Derby County. To say Frank Lampard\u2019s side were well beaten would be an understatement as goals from Kemar Roofe and Jack Harrison erased memories of a mid-winter blip featuring two successive league defeats. \u201cWe lost to the better team,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about that but\u2026\u201d It was a big but too. This will forever be a fixture haunted by memories of the bitter rivalry between Don Revie and Brian Clough and revived some of the dirty tricks detailed in David Peace\u2019s The Damned United. Earlier in the day Derby announced that police had been called to their training ground on Thursday following reports of a man equipped with binoculars, wire cutters and camouflage clothing hovering suspiciously on its boundaries. Bielsa admitted he had sent a member of his backroom staff to spy on Lampard\u2019s preparations, revealing it was a ploy he had deployed ever since his days in charge of Argentina and Chile. Unimpressed, Lampard indicated that he believed it was no coincidence that, shortly before his side lost 4-1 to Leeds at home earlier in the season, a man was spotted lurking in the bushes beside their training complex. \u201cI don\u2019t think that, at any level of sport, it\u2019s right to send men to break into private property,\u201d said Derby\u2019s manager afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural thing but I was very surprised by it \u2013 and by the frank admission he\u2019s done it before. Cheating is a big word but this is over the line. I spent 15 hours watching tapes of Leeds game this week and that\u2019s what the best managers do. I was a fan of Bielsa\u2019s from afar but I\u2019d rather not coach than send people undercover on their hands and knees in the undergrowth.\u201d If MI6 are unlikely to be poaching the \u201cagent\u201d Bielsa dispatched to Derby any time soon, it rather begs the question as to how many other Championship rivals have been spied on since August? Not that Lampard\u2019s defence could use such dubious tactics as an excuse. That quartet should have conceded a penalty following Andre Wisdom\u2019s foul on Ezgjan Alioski but, although the referee pointed to the spot, a linesman had already flagged \u2013 controversially \u2013 for an offside against Alioski. It was, though, merely a stay of execution. When Scott Carson could only punch Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s corner towards Jack Clarke, the latter proceeded to sweep beyond Craig Bryson and deliver a superb right-wing cross. It found Roofe in the right place at the right time to lash a first-time volley home. Lampard stared at the ground. His players could barely get out of their own half and frequently seemed overwhelmed by the relentless tempo of Leeds\u2019 high pressing game. At times it was easy to imagine that Bielsa\u2019s team had a couple of extra players on the pitch. Derby were failing to work out the home side\u2019s highly fluid formation \u2013 one minute 4-1-4-1 and 3-3-3-1 the next \u2013 and kaleidoscopic, opponent perplexing, positional rotation. Alioski not only alternated between left-back and midfield but occasionally centre forward too. His side doubled their advantage at the outset of the second half. Once again Clarke provoked panic on the right and, once again, Carson made less than perfect contact as he misread his looping cross. The goalkeeper\u2019s weak punch travelled only as far as Alioski who played it back in for Harrison to score from close range. Spy-gate may be boiling up but Leeds show few signs of burning out. \u201cI would accept any sanction the club or federation make against me,\u201d said an unrepentant Bielsa. \u201cI respect the morals of the country where I work but I won\u2019t say I won\u2019t do it again. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a person that cheats. I have done this practice for many years. It\u2019s legal in South America \u2013 and England, too, but it doesn\u2019t provoke indignation in South America.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
