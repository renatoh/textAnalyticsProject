The Argentinian has never been part of a championship challenge during his time in charge of a club and he was involved in one only once during his playing days in Europe \u2013 with Paris St-Germain in 2001-02, when they finished fourth. At the very beginning of his career, though, when he was a defender for Newell\u2019s Old Boys, Pochettino twice won the domestic title. The Argentinian league season was then split into two 19-game competitions \u2013 the Apertura and the Clausura (opening and closing tournaments). Pochettino and Newell\u2019s won the Apertura in 1990-91 and the Clausura in 1991-92, which saw them qualify for the Copa Libertadores. In their 1992 Libertadores campaign, they were beaten in the final by S\u00e3o Paulo on penalties. When Pochettino was a youth player at Newell\u2019s, the club won the 1987-88 Primera Divisi\u00f3n title, which was before the days of the season being split into two, although he did not feature. Tottenham are third in the Premier League, five points behind the leaders, Leicester City, before their home game against Watford on Saturday and the club\u2019s fans are daring to dream of a first title since 1961. Pochettino sees clear parallels between his current team \u2013 who have the youngest average age in the division \u2013 and that of Newell\u2019s when he first tasted success. \u201cWhen we won three titles and arrived to the final of the Copa Libertadores, we were very similar to the squad we have now at Tottenham, in terms of the balance between younger and more senior, experienced players,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung players have hunger, energy and potential and if they show they have enough quality, it\u2019s perfect, especially if you have good team-mates, who give you good advice. I was 18 years old when I won my first title with Newell\u2019s. \u201cThere are a lot of factors in football but if you have good balance between younger and experienced players, it is a perfect mix to try to achieve big things.\u201d Always in life, you need to show and to do, rather than speak too much about the things you cannot change with your words.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important to show that we are in the race to achieve big things. You can speak a lot but you need to show that we are a team. I think my players are clever and I trust in them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
