The script may be deep-space corny, the plot borrowed from 2001, but De Palma launches into some scenes of high suspense, though he uses them up well before the tiresome finale. Buchanan Rides Alone (Budd Boetticher, 1958) 2.40pm, BBC2 Light-hearted Boetticher-Randolph Scott collaboration investing standard plot with bushwhacking good humour. Scott plays cheery Buchanan, riding into the town of Agry and clearing it of the villainous Agry boys amid much fist-fightin', shootin' and lynchin'. This is how B-westerns were meant to be. Young Winston (Richard Attenborough, 1972) 4.45pm, BBC2 This account of the dashing young Winston Churchill's youthful adventures protecting the British Empire in India and South Africa looks like pure Boy's Own invention, but it's largely true - the action is gleaned from Churchill's autobiography, My Early Life. Simon Ward is a tad effeminate in the title role, but it rips and roars through war, family strife and political chicanery. East Is East (Damien O'Donnell, 1999) 9pm, C4 O'Donnell's screen version of Ayub Khan-Din's play is a delightful little comedy about an Asian family's struggles in early-70s Salford. Om Puri is the Pakistani dad who runs the fish and chip shop with English wife Linda Bassett, and tries to bring up his large family in the traditional manner - arranged marriages, excruciating family gatherings and all; but the children start to rebel. A film that makes its points with wit and warmth. The Hole (Nick Hamm, 2001) 10.50pm, C4 After four pupils at an English boarding school go missing for two weeks, and only one of them returns, police psychologist Embeth Davidtz question the survivor (Thora Birch) about what happened to the other three in the abandoned bunker where they were trapped. Adapted from Guy Burt's cult novel, it's an edgy, harrowing British excursion into teen-thriller territory - even if Hamm doesn't quite sustain it to the bitter end. The Lightship (Jerzy Skolimowski, 1985) 12.15am, BBC2 Psychotic Robert Duvall and his ugly escapee henchmen hijack a lightship off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia, but the captain is impassive Klaus Maria Brandauer and the baddies have run their flag up the wrong pole. Good, glowering performances and a suspenseful clash of light and dark, good and evil, in a drama reminiscent of Huston's Key Largo. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (Tobe Hooper, 1974) 1.10am, C4 Hooper's intelligent and disturbing horror movie is based on the gruesome exploits of Winsconsin serial killer Ed Gein. A bunch of standard-issue teenagers (including Marilyn Burns) travelling in the Texas wilderness are carved up, one by one, by Gunnar Hansen's Leatherface, an inbred monster who wears a mask of human skin and wields a chainsaw. The film has a notorious reputation but there's little graphic violence and there's a wicked sense of humour at work in the depiction of Leatherface's cannibalistic family. La Nouvelle \u00c8ve (Catherine Corsini, 1999) 3.10am, BBC2 Karin Viard as Camille has the gamine charm of Audrey Tautou's Am\u00e9lie, and is the best thing about this cliched French drama. Camille lives a carefree life of casual sex and drugs, until she falls for a happily married man (Pierre-Loup Rajot): then it's all about the emotional travails of the mistress, but with its dull script and two-dimensional characters, there's only the vibrant Viard to admire. Sunday May 11 The Jewel Of The Nile (Lewis Teague, 1985) 3pm, ITV1 Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner are reunited for this sequel to Romancing The Stone. After a few months of romantic stuff, the schooner the couple \"sailed\" through Manhattan at the end of the original is blown to bits, and they are pitched into a new adventure in the Middle East. There's another jewel, although it's not quite what they imagine it to be. Again it's fast and funny, with Danny DeVito enjoying himself as the villain. Remember: when the going gets tough, the tough get going... Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (Dwight H Little, 1995) 6.15pm, Five The cuddly killer whale returns to be menaced by an oil slick from a damaged tanker. Young human friend Jesse (Jason James Richter) helps save the day, while discovering youthful yearnings for Nadine (Mary Kate Schellhardt) and having problems with the foster parents. All pretty similar to part one, then. Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom (Steven Spielberg, 1984) 8.05pm, BBC1 Harrison Ford's intrepid archaeologist, variously aided and hindered by companions Short Round and Willie Scott, launches into a death-defying quest for the magical Sankara stone. Yes, we've been here before in Raiders Of The Lost Ark, but this second of the three Indiana films is still a hugely enjoyable adventure with some hugely enjoyable set-pieces. Hero (Zhang Yimou, 2002) 9.05pm, C4 If there were an Oscar for most beautiful movie, Zhang Yimou's historical epic would have won by the length of the Great Wall. It's set in the third century BC, where warrior Jet Li is telling the emperor how he has disposed of his enemies, in a series of flashback fights. Reactionary politics aside, it's exquisite. Legally Blonde (Robert Luketic, 2001) 9.05pm, Five Reese Witherspoon's Californian sorority queen, Elle, is undeterred when her ambitious boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis) dumps her for more intellectual types as he heads for Harvard Law School: she enrols there too. Witherspoon is in her element as a pretty-in-pink bull in a china shop in Harvard's hallowed halls - even if the way in which her Valley girl street-wisdom proves superior to the sophistication of her fellow students seems a tad implausible. Sudden Death (Peter Hyams, 1995) 10.55pm, C4 Smooth villain Powers Boothe and gang have sealed off an ice hockey stadium's VIP lounge, taken the US vice-prez prisoner and are demanding an implausible ransom to be delivered before the game ends. Then, up steps firefighter Jean-Claude Van Damme, an ordinary guy, to save his little girl, who is among the hostages. Gossip (Davis Guggenheim, 2000) 11pm, Five A flawed thriller from the director of Al Gore's global warming alert, An Inconvenient Truth. This is more an inconvenient falsehood, with three college students whimsically starting a rumour - that their virginal classmate (Kate Hudson) had sex at a party. Sounds fairly innocent, but it all gets ludicrously out of hand, and grows ever less plausible. The Invisible Circus (Adam Brooks, 2001) 1.45am, C4 Pretty but limp drama in which Jordana Brewster's Phoebe tries to unravel the mystery of her sister Faith's (Cameron Diaz) suicide. She follows Faith's hippy 60s quest through Amsterdam and Paris to the Portuguese coast and takes up, hesitantly, with sis's ex, Christopher Eccleston. It's a long, cliche-ridden journey. Monday May 12 The Way We Were (Sydney Pollack, 1973) 12.45pm, C4 Love on the grand scale between Robert Redford's indolent upper-crust writer and Barbra Streisand's brash political activist, from the innocence of 30s college days to the McCarthyite 50s. They make a lovely couple, but it's a long haul and the only really memorable part is the Oscar-winning theme song, sung by Streisand. Exit Wounds (Andrzej Bartkowiak, 2001) 10pm, C4 If you were hoping Steven Seagal had gone to the retirement home for chubby washed-up martial arts stars, you'll be disappointed to see him jogging through his same old shtick here. He's disgraced cop Orin Boyd, back on the streets of Detroit and mixing it with corrupt cops and drug dealers. The Forgotten (Joseph Ruben, 2004) 11.05pm, Five The excellent Julianne Moore works hard to keep this paranoid sci-fi thriller on track: she's a mum grieving for her eight-year-old son who died in a plane crash - except that now she's being told by shrink Gary Sinise, and everyone else, that she has invented the whole tragedy and never had a son. Cue gradual revelation of a giant, not-very-credible conspiracy... Tuesday May 13 The Last Command (Frank Lloyd, 1955) 12.50pm, C4 A less well-known account of the siege of the Alamo, in which 187 Texans held out against a massive Mexican force in 1836. John Wayne's 1960 movie, The Alamo, is of course the definitive version, but this earlier movie from Lloyd is authentically done, focusing on Sterling Hayden's heroic James Bowie. Phenomenon (Jon Turteltaub, 1996) 11.15pm, BBC1 John Travolta stars as George Malley, an ordinary garage mechanic until a bolt from the blue turns him into a genius who speed-reads, soaks up facts and figures, and predicts natural disasters. For a while he's the talk of the town while he woos single mum Kyra Sedgwick; but there's a price to pay for his new gifts... Wednesday May 14 Bounce (Don Roos, 2000) 11.30pm, BBC1 Ben Affleck stars as a cocky ad executive who gives his plane ticket to an acquaintance at the airport so that he can dally with Natasha Henstridge; the plane crashes, killing all on board. Wallowing in guilt and booze, he seeks out the dead man's widow (Gwyneth Paltrow) and of course falls for her, but can he cast off his arrogant, womanising ways? Friday May 16 Timecop (Peter Hyams, 1994) 11.40pm, BBC1 Jean-Claude Van Damme knocks holes in the space-time continuum to investigate crooked senator Ron Silver. And while he's there, to check out the murder of his wife (Mia Sara). Hyams is pretty adept at these sci-fi shenanigans, and Van Bam does the business with fists, feet and guns. Day Of The Dead (George A Romero, 1985) 12.35am, BBC2 After Night Of The Living Dead and Dawn Of The Dead, this concluded Romero's zombie trilogy (that, with Land Of The Dead, belatedly became a quartet). Surviving humans are in an underground silo trying to rehabilitate the flesh-eating undead in another gory, tongue-in-cheek, intelligent horror movie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
