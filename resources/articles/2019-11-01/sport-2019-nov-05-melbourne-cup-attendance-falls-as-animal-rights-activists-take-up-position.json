By 5pm, when local hope Vow and Declare had claimed the Cup in a dramatic finish and the attendance figures were distributed, it was easy for those critics to claim something was changing. Despite a glorious Melbourne day, the crowd was, for the fourth year in a row, smaller than the Cup before. The official attendance of 81,400 is the lowest attendance since 1993, cup records show. Those who have been coming to Flemington for years suspected something was up. \u201cThis one is a bit quieter than the other ones,\u201d said Marley Ingram, 34, who has been coming to the Cup with his wife since 2013. \u201cBut it\u2019s still a great crowd.\u201d Still he said the day retained its sense of joy. \u201cI grew up in Melbourne. It has a special place in my heart. I like the day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt brings a lot of people out, you\u2019ve got a lot of different races, religions mixing.\u201d Where recent cup days have been dampened, literally, by poor weather, Melbourne turned up the sunshine on Tuesday. That suggests the low attendance figures are more notable, but also made for a magical day for people like Norma Weekes. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done a cruise, or never done anything [like this] in our lives, so we thought we\u2019d do the Melbourne Cup cruise,\u201d Weekes, 65, of Newcastle said. Weekes travelled down to Melbourne with her husband. Racing itself means little to her, but the Cup is special. \u201cIt\u2019s the only time I bet on a horse,\u201d Weekes said. Of the recent controversies and allegations of animal cruelty in the industry, Weekes said: \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, love \u2026 I reckon that\u2019s bullshit.\u201d Satwinder Singh, 34, came to the Cup with 11 friends. \u201cIt means looking at classy people, classy girls, and making new friends,\u201d he said, grinning. But Singh was not pleased to read about racehorses being sent to slaughter. \u201cFrom my understanding, maybe I\u2019m wrong, when the horses are not good for the races, they get rid of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should stop.\u201d In the lead up to Tuesday, Racing Victoria announced a $25m welfare package. Last year, one Cup runner, Cliffsofmoher was euthanised after the race. By Tuesday evening, there were no recorded deaths, but the Cup runner Rostoprovich was reportedly taken to the equine centre with a suspected crack in his pelvis. He finished 24th. Outside the racecourse, protesters held their own event, Nup To The Cup. \u201cWe think there\u2019s been a huge shift,\u201d Elio Celotto, of the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses, told Guardian Australia on Cup morning. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see people are taking affirmative action and choosing not to support the Melbourne Cup.\u201d Their signs carried messages such as \u201cAnother Race, Another Victim\u201d while music blared with an ominous voice over. \u201cIt\u2019s cruel, barbaric and outdated.\u201d \u201cI think the point of being here is that there are alternatives,\u201d he said. \u201cEach placard that is held up, we see people driving by, walking by, and sometimes they look and they are obviously thinking about it. We think it does make a difference. I think we need to use every avenue to bring it to the attention of the general public.\u201d Some things don\u2019t change. On the lawns, the frivolity began soon after the Cup was run and won. The allure of the Cup brought Nicholas Dodd, 35, to Flemington by himself. Dodd, a New Yorker who is in Australia to study, said all he knew of the Cup was \u201cmostly that people just come out, have a good time, drink a little bit too much\u201d. As the final race was run, a crowd gathered as a young man attempted some enthusiastic, though not exactly graceful, break dancing. There was a huge thud, and loud cheers, as he hit the turf after a semi-successful backflip. He was then joined by another man, in bare feet, who succeeded at a headstand. They slapped each other\u2019s bottoms and engaged in some play-fighting. More backflips. Then a shirt came off. Security moved in, but were discouraged by the loud boos that followed. Later, they returned with police. And the crowd dispersed. On Tuesday evening, police said six people were arrested at the racetrack."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
