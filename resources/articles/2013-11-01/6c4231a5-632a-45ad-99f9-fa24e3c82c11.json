IDS wins an award. It's a Bloody Nora", "bodyText": "\u2022 They said it would be a game-changer. And in many ways the government has been proved right about Iain Duncan Smith's Universal Jobmatch scheme, his vehicle for turning skivers into strivers. With all those bogus vacancies and technical eccentricities, no one has seen anything quite like it. Predictably, the awards follow, and thus the initiative this week picked up a little something from the National Online Recruitment awards, the biggest in the recruitment industry. \"The wooden Nora for the worst job board, and biggest disappointment goes to Universal Jobmatch from the Dept for Work &amp; Pensions,\" the announcement says. A \"mongrel of a recruitment website\" that \"commits almost every online recruitment crime, and then some,\" the citation said. Recognition from those who know and a prize: a carved block of cedar wood. IDS will be so pleased. A shame he couldn't have been there in person. \u2712 \u2022 From behind the shuttered curtains of Whitehall, more evidence of the government's predilection for avoiding awkward questions by citing cost. Lord Beecham asked how many female prisoners have been held in segregation units for more than three months or more than six months. Seems the sort of thing an engaged member of the legislature might ask. Enter Lord McNally, justice minister. When last we met him, he was fobbing off an inquiry from Lord Kennedy of Southwark on grounds of cost. Just the man to wave the empty Whitehall kitty at Lord Beecham. We haven't a clue, the minister said, for individual prison governors hold the info and it \"could only be provided at disproportionate cost by collating the relevant information from segregation records held by individual prison establishments\". There are only ten women's prisons. Ten first-class stamps. We really are tightening those belts. \u2022 And from the Tory turf of Croydon, south London, more proof that members neither love nor fear the leader. We must have more women in our party, says PM Dave, because the strategists tell him so. We must find more minorities. They tell him that too. And so it was that the good folk of Croydon South drew up an admirable longlist with both deficiencies addressed, and then a shortlist of four with three very able women and one female minority candidate. And then, when the new fangled recruitment process was over, they ended up with the white bloke as their candidate. Good luck to him and it was all on merit, of course; but then it always, is and the result is predictable. Hold tight; back to the future. \u2022 To St Bride's church on Fleet Street, for a journalists' event focused mainly on foreign correspondents but encompassing all who inform the public. A Mission in Peril: Celebrating the Media in Troubled Times. Prayers are offered. One catches the eye. \"Strengthen, Lord we pray, all who work in the media, those working through difficulty and uncertainty, and especially those facing legal proceedings at this time. May they find strength in thy presence and in the support of friends and colleagues.\" God knows who they are. So do we. \u2022 Rejoicing at the BBC, as recorded by the media website the Drum. \"The BBC has announced the promotion of Gautam Rangarajan to director of strategy, from controller of public service strategy. Rangarajan led the director-general's recent strategy review.\" How did he rise so fast? Ever the strategist. \u2022 And rejoicing in the capital. The birds they sing, the sun it shines and everything seems for the best in this the best of all possible worlds. November 14, 2013: the joint 65th birthday of Paul Dacre, who giveth so much joy from his perch at the Daily Mail, and Prince Charles, who in his own way doeth likewise. One is a crotchety campaigner, at odds with the modern world, who habitually bombards the government with his opinions and demands that ministers respond to them. Then there is Charles, merely heir to the throne. Different in so many respects, and one doubts they will celebrate together. But both will radiate more bonhomie than usual today. diary@theguardian.com Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
