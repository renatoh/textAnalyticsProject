Twelve months after relegation to Division One, the women dominated the weekend in Finland, winning nine of the 20 events - with the team captain Goldie Sayers setting the standard and Hatti Dean, in the 3,000 metres steeplechase, showing the spirit of the squad. \"The women did it in style,\" said Dave Collins, UK Athletics' national performance director who monitored the performance while with the men's team in Munich. \"They exceeded expectations.\" Sayers helped the team take control of the competition on Saturday when she won the javelin with 60.41m, once more beating the European silver medallist Barbora Spotakova, of the Czech Republic, who threw 58.45. Yesterday's star performance came from Dean, who won in 9min 42.66sec to break her own national record for the second time in 15 days. On this occasion she beat it by 0.45sec. \"I didn't expect to run a quick time, so I'm delighted to beat the record,\" she said. \"I was just concentrating on winning rather than getting the quick time, so it was a big bonus.\" In addition to athletics, Dean is employed as a work and pensions statistician and she is having no trouble figuring out what it takes to improve at this distance. She took the lead yesterday after Ireland's Roisin McGettigan hit a barrier, and ran on her own for nearly two laps, winning the race by more than eight seconds. Sayer's team scored 131 points, beating Sweden with 110, which means the men and women will be together in the Super League in Annecy, France, next year. Britain had led overnight by just six points from the Czech Republic, but the European Cup has a habit of producing new stars - and it was quite a day for Hallamshire Harriers from Sheffield. Dean's club colleague Abby Westley is not 20 until next month but, on her senior debut, she won the 1500m in style. She produced a decisive kick in the home straight to triumph in 4:21.14, having kept out of trouble in a race which was run at slow pace. \"I trusted my finish and knew that if I timed it right, I could win,\" said Westley. \"The team was on a roll - I wanted to add to that.\" Joice Maduaka, below, had a superb weekend, earning 23 points from a possible 24. On Saturday she was second in the 100m before being part of the triumphant sprint relay team, and yesterday she won the 200m in 23.31. Jo Pavey, the Commonwealth silver medallist, was in a class of her own in the 5,000m, lapping two of her rivals on her way to a fine win in 15:43.86. Carey Easton, Jenny Meadows, Tasha Danvers-Smith and Lee McConnell then combined to seal the weekend success by winning the 4 x 400m relay in a time of 3:29.51. \"The victory in the relay means so much to us, because we have helped make sure we are back in the Super League next year - where we belong,\" said Danvers-Smith."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
