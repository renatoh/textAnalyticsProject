Victory went to Niche Market, trained in Dorset by Bob Buckler and the third English-trained winner of the race in the last six years. For Buckler, this was a very welcome, if highly unusual, taste of the big time. Since taking out his first licence 15 years ago, the 54-year-old has made few headlines and yesterday's prize money of \u00a4141,500 is more than he won in the whole of last season. Niche Market was his first winner since January and Buckler was understandably enthusiastic in his praise. \"He is a lovely horse and an absolute star,\" the trainer said. \"He got cast in his box and ripped a shoe off yesterday afternoon. That was a worry, to put it mildly, but the farrier came out and got it sorted. He's a brilliant jumper when he gets light at his fences and we'll look at Aintree with him next year.\" Niche Market was one of four reserves in this year's Grand National but was denied a run when there were no non-runners. \"That may have been a blessing in disguise,\" Buckler added, \"as this was much more suitable for him.\" Yesterday's success could be the first of many big days for Niche Market's rider, 19-year-old Harry Skelton, who gave a wild roundhouse punch to the air as the pair crossed the line two lengths ahead of Church Island. \"It's probably the greatest achievement of my life so far,\" he enthused. Skelton's father is the veteran showjumper Nick, who established a record height for the sport in Britain when clearing a 7ft 7in fence in 1978. The obstacles faced by Skelton Jr yesterday were not so intimidating, but then he was travelling at racing speed in the company of 29 rivals. \"My dad is here to enjoy it, so it's absolutely unbelievable,\" Skelton added. \"A win like this can only help my career but in this game you are never at the top, the bar keeps on rising. You only need to look at Tony McCoy, he's at the top of his game but he's always trying to improve.\" In fact, McCoy endured a miserable day as his National mount, Wichita Lineman, who had provided him with his only win at the Cheltenham Festival, fell at the first and sustained a fatal injury. Drumconvis was also destroyed after an early fall. Officials at Epsom remain hopeful that a sponsor can be found for this year's Derby, though time is running out, with the Classic less than two months away. A source close to the negotiations said yesterday that two leads were being pursued and the next few days would be critical as the course prepares to stage its first meeting of the year next Wednesday, when a new grandstand will be opened. At least one potential sponsor came close to signing a deal before backing off, it is claimed. Others have indicated that they would be much more open to backing the race from next year, when it is hoped that economic conditions may have improved. Vodafone agreed to back the Derby for one last year in 2008, when the Oaks and the Coronation Cup were supported by Juddmonte Stud. All three Group One races may yet be unsponsored this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
