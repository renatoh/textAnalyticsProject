Well, until Frankel runs again, that is. Willie Carson predicted before the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot that Frankel should have wing mirrors fitted to see how the rest of the field is doing. Too true. Frankel's 11th win from 11 starts turned into a procession \u2013 the official margin was 11 lengths \u2013 as he powered away from Excelebration with barely a flick of the whip. Tom Queally, who had ridden Frankel throughout his unbeaten career, said that all he had to do was sit there, and away he went. Never mind the horses Frankel is now being compared to (Sea-Bird, Brigadier Gerard, Tudor Minstrel, Nijinsky, Red Rum, Shergar), this thoroughbred is now giving humans a serious run for their money (Pel\u00e9, Ayrton Senna and Muhammad Ali). And his performance is improving each time. All this horse has to beat next time is himself. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 June 2012. It originally mispelled Tom Queally's surname as Quealy"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
