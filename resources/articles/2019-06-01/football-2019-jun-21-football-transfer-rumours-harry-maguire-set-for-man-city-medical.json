Dan James has arrived from Swansea for \u00a317m and reports suggest young Crystal Palace full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka will be rocking up at Old Trafford once England\u2019s interest in the European U-21 Championships ends, but the club\u2019s supporters want to see more incomings and outgoings sooner rather than later. Harry Maguire has been a long-time target of United\u2019s but looks likely to ignore their overtures if rumours that Manchester City have arranged an appointment for him to cough for their doctor turn out to hold any water. United have continually balked at paying a fee north of \u00a375m for the Leicester defender and it seems City are prepared to pull the rug from under their feet as they continue to dither. With United\u2019s players due to convene for training ahead of the new season on 1 July before heading off on a tour of Australia and Asia, the club remain hopeful of enticing midfielders Declan Rice and Sean Longstaff from West Ham and Newcastle respectively, while the agent of Sporting attacker Bruno Fernandes is reported to be in Manchester to talk turkey about a move to Old Trafford for his client. Speculation elsewhere suggests he has also spoken to Spurs. Reports from Germany suggest Atl\u00e9tico Madrid midfielder Rodri has eschewed a move to Bayern Munich in favour of signing up for Manchester City for a fee of \u00a362m, while Liverpool seem likely to be thwarted in their attempts to sign Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 after Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu insisted the French striker is going nowhere. Tottenham\u2019s dogged pursuit of Lyon central midfielder Tanguy Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9 could be coming to an end, what with the north London club reported to be increasingly confident of landing their man by the end of the month. Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas claims his club have received several bids for the 22-year-old, with representatives of both Manchester City and United also believed to be gyrating lasciviously in a bid to attract the player\u2019s attention. \u201cWe have lots of offers but they do not come up to the price we feel is right, said Aulas in a party political broadcast to L\u2019Equipe, before announcing that one-time Liverpool target Nabil Fekir is also leaning towards a move elsewhere. Meanwhile in Spain, Real Betis left-back Junior Firpo is being courted by Liverpool, who would have to trigger a \u00a345m release clause to land the 22-year-old. Following the departure of Alberto Moreno for pastures new and yet to be confirmed, Firpo would provide cover for Andy Robertson. Across the Atlantic, Real Salt Lake\u2019s diminutive Venezuelan winger Jefferson Savarino is wanted by West Ham and Tottenham and could be available for a cut-price \u00a36m. And finally, Matt Clarke is ready to swap one south coast seaside town for another by moving from Portsmouth to Brighton. The 22-year-old will undergo a medical with the Premier League club today before a \u00a35m deal is signed, sealed and delivered."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
