On first glance, the bid from the Brazilian club appears fanciful in the extreme. Tevez, whose contract at City is thought to be in excess of \u00a3200,000 a week and runs until June 2014, is regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, and the Brazilian league would fall well short of the standards he has become used to in Europe. However there are several factors in its favour. Tevez has been unhappy at City for a while despite winning the FA Cup and qualifying for the Champions League last season, and said last week that he wants to be closer to his two children and their mother, who live in Argentina. He has been linked with moves to Italy and Spain, but the chance to return to South America may tempt the 27-year-old. \"It's true,\" said Tevez's adviser, Kia Joorabchian. \"Corinthians got in touch and we're looking at the possibility.\" Although City have not yet responded to the offer, it falls some way short of their \u00a350m asking price, but would mean not selling him to a rival. There is no prospect of him moving to another English club, but with City having qualified for the Champions League for the first time, it may suit them better to let him join Corinthians rather than Internazionale or Real Madrid. Tevez's time at City, for whom he has scored 53 goals in 86 games, has mostly been fractious since he joined Roberto Mancini's side from Manchester United two years ago. He handed in a transfer request last December, which City rejected, but now it seems certain he will depart this summer. His desire to leave is mainly centred around his former partner, Vanesa, being unable to settle in Manchester. She chose to return to Argentina with their two daughters, Katie and Florencia. \"I need to be closer to them and to spend more time with them,\" said Tevez in a statement last week. \"Living without my children in Manchester has been incredibly challenging for me. Everything I do, I do for my daughters.\" Tevez played for Corinthians from 2004 to 2006, before moving to West Ham United. He spent a season at Upton Park, before spells at United and City."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
