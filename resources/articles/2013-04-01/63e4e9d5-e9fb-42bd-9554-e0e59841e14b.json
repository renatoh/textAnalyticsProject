The area's Dunkin Donuts stayed open at the special request of police authorities, which means a great many doughnut makers were forced to find their way to work somehow \u2013 and will, of course be paid for their hours. But what about other employees, up and down the wage spectrum? Boston Children's hospital tweeted that it would not charge employees for the time off: While at Harvard and at least one Staples location, workers were expected to ignore the police order and show up for work. There were scattered reports around the city of employers forcing workers to take the day as an unscheduled vacation day \u2013 charging them for the hours not worked. Update: A spokesman for Staples says that all its locations were closed today, but some employees did not get the notification in time and arrived at their places of work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
