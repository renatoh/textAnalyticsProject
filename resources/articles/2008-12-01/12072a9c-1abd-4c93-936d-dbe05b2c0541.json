Instead there have been complaints that the Turner prize show has been a bore - and without controversy, without shocks, without the ire of middle England, what is it for? What the current prize exhibition has appeared to lack has been a character for anyone to latch on to - a Grayson Perry, a Mark Wallinger, a Tracey Emin or even an icily reticent Tomma Abts. There is instead Mark Leckey, the lone male in this year's lineup, now winner of the 2008 Turner prize. Presenting himself as a dinner-jacketed speaker, delivering a lengthy filmed lecture as the centrepiece of his exhibition, Leckey has only now, having won the prize, become the suave artist savant the media might latch on to. In real life Leckey is a professor in Germany, and all his art is a kind of erudite demonstration, in one form or another. Of this year's shortlist, Leckey's is the work I like least, and have always found it smug, though this hardly counts as criticism. His self-invented persona, the artist as dandy, is reflected in his films and installations. In his way he is a perfect Turner prize winner. His art is a sum of references - to dancehall music, to fashion, to Richard Hamilton, to 1960s pop star Adam Faith, to Viz comic, and much more besides. Even the best line in Leckey's lecture/performance - the remark that James Cameron's 1997 movie Titanic is the story of something going from pure horizontality, to perfect verticality to invisibility - is borrowed from American critic Jerry Saltz. This is an acceptable way to go, but it doesn't touch me. I felt that Goshka Macuga reworked and transformed her pre-war modernist source material far more effectively. Cathy Wilkes has been discussed as having made the worst Turner prize show ever. People have short memories. I wanted Runa Islam's film installations - in which the settings seem as important as the films themselves - to win. Like Macuga's work, they stayed with me and have grown in stature. Theirs is a genuine sophistication."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
