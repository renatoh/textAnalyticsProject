Asked why he was confident Houllier would return, his assistant Gary McAllister smiled. \"I know him better than you, I know what type of man he is. He spent a bit of time working in the French Football Association, maybe pushing a pen around a desk, and I know what he wants, what he loves and where he wants to be \u2013 and that's on a training ground every day, with the players.\" What Houllier wants and what he is advised to do may be different things but the way McAllister went on to talk about the potential at Villa if they are successful in adding targets identified by Houllier to the playing squad very much suggested a happy return is expected. Darren Bent certainly hopes so. The England striker's seventh goal in his 12th game since moving to Villa from Sunderland in January was the highlight of a forgettable match, at least in terms of quality. As McAllister pointed out, it is impossible to teach the instinctive ability Bent demonstrated in getting in front of Ryan Shawcross to meet Kyle Walker's cross and then, from a difficult angle close to the edge of the penalty area, guiding a header beyond Stoke City goalkeeper Asmir Begovic. \"The fee we paid is looking good value,\" said McAllister. \"He has produced, and now he's looking as if he could be [England manager] Fabio Capello's main man.\" Certainly no English striker is in better form. Bent revealed Houllier had texted him before the game. \"He said to me: 'Keep going and keep playing well and all the best', which was quite nice,\" Bent said. \"He won't let it go and that is just him. He is passionate about his football, although there are times when your health comes first though and hopefully he realises that.\" But Bent confirmed Houllier's influence had been an important factor in his impressive performances. \"The manager took a big gamble bringing me in for a big amount of money. He works with me every day to help me improve and tells me what I am good at.\" \"He is always talking to me about when he had Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen and Thierry Henry, always giving me little tips. I think the club are trying to arrange a visit for the boys, so hopefully I will get a chance to see him soon.\" Regarding his international prospects, Bent has clearly had enough disappointment not to get carried away, despite playing in England's last two matches. \"I can't score many more goals than I did last season [24 in 38 league appearances] and it still wasn't good enough for England. But all I can do is keep working hard and improving as a footballer and hopefully Capello will keep picking me.\" Bent's goal came after another powerful and technically gifted striker, Kenwyne Jones, had put Stoke ahead with a header direct from a Rory Delap long throw. \"Forwards go up and down, even the top strikers like Wayne Rooney, they're all the same, but the thing with Kenwyne is he has good quality, and you know eventually that will come through,\" said City manager Tony Pulis, who felt that three or four of his players had looked jaded and off the pace during the second half. There was less good news for another striker, Stoke's Ricardo Fuller, who was taken off on a stretcher with what appeared to be a serious achilles injury shortly after coming on as a second-half substitute and may miss the club's first FA Cup final as a result."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
