Some have avoided the issue entirely, others have lapsed into cliche: very few have found a voice that speaks to the soul. More than 200 readers aged between 11 and 18 took up our challenge and, to their credit, even if it was just a paragraph or an odd phrase, almost every writer came up with a striking image or idea. Including poems and essays in the same competition is always problematic, but the thriller writer Ian Rankin spoke for all the judges when he talked about reaching his decision. \"Poems are more about imagery, whereas essays require a reasoned structure and argument. But in both categories I was looking for a general awareness of what the Holocaust means, together with a fresh interpretation, as each generation will have a new outlook on events.\" In the 16-18 category, the actor Antony Sher picked out David Sim's poem, \"Perfection\". \"It was a startling piece of writing - a very bleak but sharp picture of the Holocaust,\" he said. \"He had a remarkable ability to turn cliches on their head and his phrase 'jacknifed politics' brilliantly realised a subconscious vision of jackboots.\" However, the clear winner of the older age-group was Marta Tycinska for her poem, \"My Grandfather\". Ian Rankin praised her moving combination of historical argument and personal involvement, picking out the lines \"Back in the good old days when the people I loved were immortal\" as ones that had remained with him. \"I might even use them myself at some point,\" he laughed. The broadcaster Fergal Keane argued that Tycinska had a gift for imagery that was abstract, lyrical and humanising. \"Her poem was the one entry that really sang out to me.\" Choosing a winner for the younger age-group was far harder. Both Anna Blunt and Matthew Holehouse were mentioned in dispatches by Ian Rankin. \"Anna's poem captured the essence of bullying - the fact that the Holocaust couldn't have happened without a degree of complicity,\" he says. \"Matthew's essay was just beautifully written. I didn't agree with his entire argument, but I certainly couldn't have turned out such a fantastic piece of writing at his age.\" Fergal Keane was struck by Rosamund Hatfield's essay, \"The Forgotten Holocaust?\" \"It was both intelligent and emotional, and provided coherent reasons for remembrance,\" he points out, \"but what I particularly liked was her awareness of the genocide of the Armenians. There is a lot of pressure to forget this first Holocaust and she gave these people a voice.\" Astrid Brown's essay highlighting ethnic tensions in Scotland and Liam Young's witty and playful short poem on the maths of the Holocaust also came up in discussions. On balance, though, the judges decided to award the prize to Matthew Doidge's poem, \"The Remembrance\". \"I don't know whether he was writing about his own family or not,\" said Antony Sher, \"but it felt extremely personal.\" Jeannette Page, editor of Guardian Education, agreed. \"It captured the essence of the Holocaust through the personal rather than the historical.\" Congratulations, then, to our two winners and many thanks to all those who entered. Reading the poems and essays, it felt very much as if you all had responded out of a personal desire to make a difference, rather than just because it was a competition to be won. With this in mind, the last word should go to Fergal Keane. \"We're always being told how the young have become disenfranchised and apolitical,\" he says. \"Here is the antidote. If you asked politicians to write about the Holocaust I doubt they would have come up with something so intelligent and heartfelt.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
