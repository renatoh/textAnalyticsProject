The can was hurled from a large crowd of spectators who had gathered on the pitch below the balcony to witness the presentation of the medals at the final of the NatWest Series of one-day matches. Bevan stood rubbing his cheek with teammates around him looking puzzled and horrified. He was immediately examined by a doctor, but was only bruised. Television pictures showed the arm of the fan thought to have thrown the object. Scotland Yard is investigating. Bevan, regarded as the best one-day batsman in the world, said later that he was stunned by the action. 'I was lucky, I turned my head just in time. I could have been hit in the eye.' The MCC secretary Roger Knight said: 'It was an absolute disgrace on behalf of that one person and has ruined the whole day.' The incident was the fourth in a fortnight that violence and unruly behaviour by Pakistan fans have overshadowed events on the field. Former England captain David Gower lambasted the 'shameful end to this NatWest series. It is unbelievable, ridiculous', he said. 'These people have let their country down. This is getting out of hand. It is the first time we have ever seen scenes like this at Lord's.' Both team captains condemned the incident, which occured despite a large number of police and extra security measures at cricket's best-known ground. Australia captain Steve Waugh warned that players were now in danger of being 'seriously injured' by violent fans. 'It was a great day and then someone ruins it for everyone. Michael Bevan was hit in the face by a full can of VB (Victoria Bitter),' he said. 'It was straight in the face and it could have been serious. It's just the thought that someone could be seriously injured.' Last Sunday a steward at Headingley, in Leeds, Stephen Speight, received two cracked ribs when he was kicked during a pitch invasion after Pakistan had beaten England. Last Tuesday Waugh led his Australian side off the pitch at Trent Bridge, in Nottingham, when a firework thrown by a Pakistan fan landed close to fast bowler Brett Lee. The first Pakistan-England match of the triangular series on 7 June was also marred by misbehaviour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
