Something invariably draws them back to performing and recording: financial necessity, the enjoyment of performing, the lure of the applause that accompanies it. But when Bill Withers retired from music in the mid-80s, tired of touring and of his strained relationship with his record company (he later claimed the final straw was seeing them devote more energy to a novelty album by The A-Team star Mr T than his work) he really meant it. A full 35 years passed between the release of his final album and his death, and nothing could entice him back to the studio or the stage \u2013 save for a brief appearance on a 2004 album by, of all people, easy-going \u201cgulf-and-western\u201d singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett. Other than that, the answer was always no, regardless of the fact that his music remained popular to the point of inescapability. The changing tides of fashion never did anything to dent the appeal of Ain\u2019t No Sunshine, Lean On Me, Lovely Day and Just the Two of Us, songs that had assumed modern standard status long before he brought his recording career to an end. One young musician after another hailed him as an influence, and his musical DNA is in everything from Blackstreet\u2019s No Diggity, which sampled his 1971 single Grandma\u2019s Hands, to the folk-soul sound of Michael Kiwanuka. A 2015 Carnegie Hall tribute concert that lovingly re-created the 1973 live album he recorded at the same venue featured artists ranging from the obviously indebted to the surprising \u2013 D\u2019Angelo and Aloe Blacc alongside Ed Sheeran \u2013 but it couldn\u2019t draw Withers himself into performing. In truth, he seemed suspicious of the music industry from the start. Anyone else who\u2019d come up with a song as utterly indelible as Ain\u2019t No Sunshine \u2013 pitched perfectly between soul music and the burgeoning early-70s trend for acoustic singer-songwriters \u2013 and whose debut album could draw in artists of a calibre of Booker T and Stephen Stills, all eager to collaborate, might be inclined to believe they\u2019d made it. Withers cautiously stuck with his day job making seats for aeroplane toilets until he was laid off. On the cover of the appropriately titled Just As I Am, he\u2019s outside the factory, holding his packed lunch. The everyman image suited its contents. The songwriting was uniformly brilliant, but the arrangements were understated. Ain\u2019t No Sunshine was essentially unfinished: the repetitions of \u201cI know\u201d were there to cover for an unwritten extra verse, and became the most famous placeholder vocal in pop history. Critics occasionally took the unassuming accessibility of his music for softness \u2013 easy-listening homilies for an upwardly mobile black audience \u2013 but they clearly weren\u2019t listening to his lyrics. They weren\u2019t all gentle homespun wisdom and yearning love songs: Better Off Dead depicted an alcoholic spiralling towards suicide; I Can\u2019t Write Left-Handed dealt with a Vietnam veteran attempting to come to terms with what would now be termed \u201clife-changing injuries\u201d; Who Is He (And What Is He to You)? prickled with paranoia and suspicion. Moreover, there was a vast range and depth to his sound behind the easy-going fa\u00e7ade: Withers could do funk, he could do gospel and he could do blues, all with apparent ease. He could also do disco, commonly held to be the undoing of a whole school of earnest black artists of the early 70s. You Got the Stuff is an untrammelled delight, shifting from a primitive beatbox rhythm not too dissimilar to George McCrae\u2019s Rock Your Baby to a rather tougher, more lubricious brand of dancefloor funk than you might expect from the man on the cover of its album, 1978\u2019s \u2019Bout Love, resplendent in sensible jersey and slacks. Similarly, there\u2019s a school of thought that says his later albums drowned him in late-70s studio slickness, but if 1975\u2019s Making Music or the following year\u2019s Naked and Warm lost some of the organic feel of his debut and its equally lauded successor Still Bill, they never sounded syrupy. Listen to Don\u2019t You Want To Stay? from the former. It\u2019s ostensibly a love song, its protagonist setting out his desire for settled domesticity to a prospective partner, and it\u2019s as lushly orchestrated as a Philly soul or Barry White ballad. But there\u2019s something brooding and troubled about the melody, and about the way the string arrangement hovers around it like a dark cloud. When he sings: \u201cOh, that\u2019s what the future holds with me,\u201d it\u2019s unclear whether he views it as blessing or curse. Or listen to City of Angels from Naked and Warm. A hymn to the sunkissed land of opportunity that is LA, it suddenly loses its rhythm midway through, leaving behind five more minutes of beatless drift that are both gorgeous and unsettling. \u201cI heard you got a Disneyland not too far away,\u201d sings Withers, \u201cand when it rains I understand the skies are clear all day.\u201d There\u2019s a yearning tone to his voice that suggests he knows paradise isn\u2019t going to materialise, that life is going to be hard regardless of the climate. It says something that an oeuvre as concise as his contains hidden gems: his biggest hits got so big that they couldn\u2019t help but cast a shadow over everything else. He was still writing fantastic songs on his final album, Watching You Watching Me. This time you could claim that the production didn\u2019t suit him \u2013 it is very mid-80s, everything buffed until you can see your reflection in it \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t negate the melodic charm of the title track, or Oh Yeah! But by then, Withers was understandably worn down. It seems incredible in retrospect, but his record company rejected so many of his songs as unsuitable or of insufficient quality that seven years separated Watching You Watching Me from its predecessor. He made do in the interim with guest appearances on others\u2019 albums, and if you\u2019re in the market for another overlooked Withers classic, you could do worse than his collaboration with the Crusaders, Soul Shadows. You couldn\u2019t really blame him for walking away \u2013 especially given that his greatest hits were the kind of greatest hits that meant their author would never have to work again. That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t a crying shame he never did. But Bill Withers seemed perfectly content in retirement \u2013 unless you ventured on to the subject of the music business. He brought the house down with a series of one-liners when he was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, but that didn\u2019t preclude him letting them have it with both barrels: A&amp;R, he suggested, stood for \u201cantagonistic and redundant\u201d. If record companies called, trying to entice him back, he was apparently fond of telling them he was too busy watching television, a man who knew he\u2019d more than earned the right to tell the music business, with a genial smile, to go and screw itself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
