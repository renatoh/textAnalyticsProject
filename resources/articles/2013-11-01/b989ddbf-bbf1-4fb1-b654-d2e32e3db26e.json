Violent shootings within leading PG-13 films have tripled since the rating was introduced in 1985, researchers found. In 2009, the levels of gun violence in such movies rose as high as those rated R. But by 2012, a year when Hollywood blockbusters The Avengers, The Amazing Spiderman and Taken 2, an action thriller starring Liam Neeson, were all rated PG-13, the levels of gun violence surpassed those aimed at older audiences by a \"significant\" margin. \"Most parents would be horrified to learn that the very films that target young people are the ones with the most violence\" said Brad Bushman, a professor of communication and psychology of the Ohio State University and the study's lead author. \"Parents rely on these ratings to make decisions about that is appropriate for their children.\" Researchers from the Annenberg Public Policy Center and the Ohio State University said their findings were troubling, given the large body of research evidence showing that violent media can have harmful effects on children and youth. They cited the \"weapons effect\" a finding that just the sight or depiction of a gun can make people behave more aggressively. They also said that, with ready access to the internet and cable, children no longer need to go a movie theatre to view films, making it more likely PG-13 movies can be watched by younger children. The study, \"Gun Violence Trends in Movies\", analysed 945 movies, sampled from the 30 top-grossing movies every year from 1950 to 2012. They found the level of violence overall doubled during this period. In 1985, when PG-13 was first introduced, the level of violence in such movies was similar to that in movies rated G and PG. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing that PG-13 movies are filled with so much gun violence,\u201d said Dan Romer, director of the Adolescent Communication Institute of the Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC) and a co-author of the study. \u201cWe know that movies teach children how adults behave, and they make gun use appear exciting and attractive.\u201d Romer said that not all of the most popular films analysed from 2012 had a high level of gun violence. PG-13 movies the Hunger Games and Snow White and the Huntsman, although violent films, had no guns, he said. But those films served to bring down the average, he said. Violent encounters with guns, defined by the study as a shooting of a live target, now occur on average 2.6 times an hour in PG-13 movies, it found. In a two-hour movie, that could represent five five minute segments of gun violence, Romer said. The researchers acknowledged that, by focussing on the top selling movies, their study could also reflect a desire among teenagers for violent films. Romer said: \"Clearly these are popular. Partly the reason they get that boost in popularity is that [when rated PG-13] children can get in without a parent having to buy a ticket. If a five-year-old had an older brother, they could get in.\" By definition, a PG-13 movies is supposed to have less violence than an R movies. The Motion Picture Association of America says on its website that the violence in a PG-13 movie \"does not reach the restricted R category\". When contacted by the Guardian, the MPAA declined to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
