Every new record is just a dangerous excuse for someone to speculate about his retirement. Merely to refer yesterday to his 118th Test was to invite a momentary cringe, as if he feared that once word got out he would be treated to a trumpet salute and a Shackleton high chair. So now he refers to his Tests as \"one hundred and odd\" in the careless manner adopted by those who wish to convey the notion that numbers, especially numbers vaguely connected with age, do not matter at all. If Stewart ever does contem plate retirement, after the gymnasium rowing machine fails to keep pace perhaps, his 40th birthday next April would fit the bill. To survive that long would mean one more tour of Australia and a World Cup in South Africa. But there has been no opportunity for a relaxed look into the future, not while the injured James Foster, the favoured successor to Stewart and 17 years his junior, has been a fixture in the England dressing room all summer. It has been beneficial for Foster, a centrally contracted player, to have remained involved but it cannot have been much fun for Stewart. Stewart looked aggrieved at the suggestion that he has had a lean series against Sri Lanka. \"A run-out that was not my fault, a not-out and a good delivery\" is how he describes his summer. At Old Trafford, where he averages 53, he will be determined to build an irrefutable case for his retention. It is commonly assumed that Foster will be fit again in a fortnight, around the start of the NatWest triangular series. \"The dressing room doesn't think about my age,\" he said. \"I am a young 39, just like there are some old 32-year-olds about. This age thing is just an easy line. David Seaman is 38 and there are younger keepers pushing him, but he plays because he is better.\" Stewart will cheer every Seaman save for the rest of the World Cup, although when it comes to staving off middle age he has never been the sort for ponytails and he would wear a sarong only if it came with polished blazer buttons. But the operation he had last winter on damaged tendons in both elbows has given him cause to claim a new lease of life. \"Cortisone injections had kept me going for a year and a half but it was time to stop,\" he said. \"After the Ashes series last summer I played for Surrey against Glamorgan and was in so much pain that I could hardly pick up the bat. I could not throw a cricket ball a few yards. Without the operations I would no longer be playing. Now I'm back to 90%.\" \"Ninety per cent\" suggests the promise of better things to come but England might still prove resistant to waiting for the extra 10%. Stewart might fairly insist that the dressing room does not think about his age, but the selectors do. The main shift during Foster's absence has not been to ally everyone behind Stewart's cause but to encourage debate about the qualities of other young keepers: Glamorgan's Mark Wallace, Andrew Pratt at Durham and Sussex's Matthew Prior. Stewart will secretly be proud of drawing alongside Gooch, one of the few players of any vintage to match his singular work ethic. \"Goochie is the England player I respect more than anyone else. It shows what you can achieve when you perform over a considerable length of time but I am more concerned about playing now and playing well. I'd certainly like to play in Australia and at next year's World Cup.\" At Edgbaston two years ago when he reached 100 Tests Stewart marked the occasion with a hundred on the Queen Mother's 100th birthday and uttered the most loyal of heel-clicking proclamations about how the old girl had \"done well\". If he manages a fifty at Old Trafford it might just be worth dedicating it to the \"jubilee girl\". The royals are so uncannily popular at the moment that England would think twice before dropping him then. His career statistics are impressive: sixth in England's list of Test run-makers, he has a fighting chance of surpassing all but Gooch should he survive until next spring. Another record should not pass unnoticed at Old Trafford. Steve Bucknor will break the world record for Test umpiring appearances when he stands in his 67th match, one more than Dickie Bird. The thoughts of the world's greatest Test umpire have yet to be recorded, but there are rumours of floods in Barnsley.
