By the time we reached the resort of Geilo just after 3pm, it was already getting dark. That was a bad moment. Whatever had possessed me, I wondered, to come so far north to introduce the rest of my family to skiing, a sport that I had been fanatical about since the age of six and was desperate for the rest of them to love too. Why had I chosen this dark, cold place rather than the sunny Alps and a pretty Tyrolean village? But it was my only low moment in the week. True, being there over New Year meant the sun never quite reached our side of the valley, we went to breakfast in the dark, and we wore more layers than we might have done further south. But the next day, as I watched our five-year-old son tentatively ski down an uncrowded nursery slope, thrilled at his own boldness, and as my husband and I set out alone for a five-mile cross-country ski round the vast frozen lake in a haunting and empty landscape, I knew that it was going to be more than fine. As the only skier in our small family, I'd decided on Norway for our first family skiing holiday after much deliberation. Here was my dilemma. Where could I find: 1. a really good place for the children to learn - conveniently placed slopes, close to the hotel, and small ski-school classes, taught in English; 2. good childcare, in case the three-year old refused to go to ski-school (she refused); 3. extensive cross-country skiing in interesting surroundings, so that if my husband refused to try downhill skiing, he might be persuaded to try that instead; 4. a small, low-key place that wouldn't be crowded over the New Year holiday with loud hooray-Henrys which might put him off for life; 5. a child-friendly hotel run by people of the country rather than a tour company (better food); 6. skiing for me when I wasn't with the rest of the family (although I didn't mind if it wasn't particularly challenging); 7. most important of all, somewhere to get them hooked so we could start skiing as a family, rather than me taking off alone for the occasional weekend? Geilo turned out to be a place that had pretty much everything we wanted. For starters, the hotel could not have been more conveniently placed. It was a two-minute walk from our room (a family room in an annexe to the hotel) to the ski-centre, which housed the ski-school, the cr\u00e8che, the equipment hire and the restaurant. The centre was also right next to the nursery slope, and a minute from the chair-lift which headed up Geilo's only mountain on our side of the valley. Another revelation was the ski school. I have distant memories of learning to ski, but over the years in France or Italy I've watched children come down in groups of anything up to 20 - and always felt sorry for the ones stuck at the back learning nothing except how to crash into the child in front of them. Our son was one of only three five-year-olds in his class. Anders, who spoke perfect English, took them up and down the slope with such patience and care that by the second day our boy was stopping rather than falling and by day three he was able to execute reasonable snowplough turns (renamed \"pizzas\" since I was a child). Meanwhile our daughter, initially at least, embraced the warm sanctuary of the cr\u00e8che - greatly preferring it to the cold wet stuff outside. But a couple of days into the holiday, she decided she wanted to try what her brother was so enjoying, so I would ski with her between my legs for an hour or so in the morning until she tired, then deposit her back in the cr\u00e8che with two of the kindest, most patient nannies I've ever come across. I've never used childcare on a family holiday before, but the Neilson service is really good (they'll pick your children up from ski school, give them lunch, take them tobogganing in the afternoon and keep them occupied, if you want, until 3.30pm). And again, because Geilo is such a small resort, even during this peak holiday period they were never looking after more than about 10 children of different ages at any time. With both children happily occupied, we had the strange experience of spending time as a couple. First we tried cross-country skiing, which I hadn't done for 20 years, but had always enjoyed as an alternative to the slopes. Geilo has 250 kilometres of tracks, and as we trekked around the lake we encountered the odd person, sometimes with a dog, once pulling a baby in a covered sledge. But mostly it was a solitary and peaceful experience - even for the beginner. He soon mastered the thin skis, found his rhythm in the parallel tracks, and after an hour or so of exercise announced that he was really enjoying himself. In fact, he was so enthused by the outdoor life, that by Wednesday - to my delight - he had agreed to try some downhill. Two lessons later, he was happily skiing down the green runs - not perhaps with the confidence of the five-year-old, but not badly at all. I felt he was hooked. Norway in the middle of the winter did reduce the amount of skiing we did, but if you wanted to carry on, some of the slopes are floodlit till much later. We generally picked up the children around 2pm and did some of the other things the resort offers - our favourite was being pulled in sledges by husky dogs across the lake. But there were also horse-drawn sleigh rides, tobogganing or swimming in the hotel's pool. And the best thing was that even in peak-season, Geilo was never crowded. We didn't queue for more than a couple of minutes for lifts, the slopes were never too full, and there was a general sense of remoteness from the fast life that you rarely find in the Alps. If you're looking for more challenging skiing, you might end up frustrated: it's low, and the resort consists of two small mountains on either side of the lake, both mainly with green and blue runs. A ski-bus runs a couple of times a day between the two areas, or you can take a taxi. And it's not the place for wild apr\u00e8s-ski. There are a couple of bars (one showing Premiership football) in the nondescript little village which was a 20-minute walk (or a cross-country ski) from our hotel. The village grew up around the small railway station that marks the half-way point in the wilderness between Oslo and Bergen and has none of the charm of an Alpine village. On the other hand, it doesn't have the high-rise ugliness of a purpose-built French resort either. There was one other bad moment. Two days before the end of the holiday we woke to the sound of rain dripping off our roof. There was great consternation among the Norwegians in the hotel, who assured us that this was most unusual - the guarantee of snow until May is one of the great selling points of the resort - and blamed global warming. Happily, the rain rapidly turned to snow, and some hours later I was skiing in reasonable powder between the lifts. And finally, a warning. Norway is incredibly expensive, particularly alcohol. A small beer will cost you \u00a35 and a sandwich and coffee for two was a ridiculous \u00a325. The best bet is a half-board deal at a hotel like ours, where the food was excellent - lots of fish and reindeer and on one night the best seafood buffet I have ever eaten - and where your bar bill is your only additional expense. Not that the hotel bars were particularly crowded, presumably because they're so pricey. The family in the neighbouring room had wisely brought their own supply from duty-free and luckily for us were very happy to share it. It was a fine New Year's Eve. Way to go Georgina Henry travelled with Neilson to Geilo. 7 nights half board at the Vestlia hotel costs from \u00a3535-\u00a3899pp for adults, 15% discount for children sharing a room. Children aged 3-15 years receive free ski equipment and helmets when two adults pre-book. Children under six also receive free lift passes.
