Trump will seek to project self-confidence and portray himself as a winner when he takes the stage at the Amway Center in Orlando, Florida, before a typically raucous 20,000-capacity crowd more than 16 months before election day in November 2020. The rally \u201clooks to be setting records\u201d, he claimed in a tweet on Monday, adding: \u201cWe are building large movie screens outside to take care of everybody. Over 100,000 requests. Our Country is doing great, far beyond what the haters &amp; losers thought possible \u2013 and it will only get better!\u201d But beneath the surface self-congratulation, there is cause for panic in Trumpworld. Democrats will seek to undercut the show of strength by staging a counter-rally outside the stadium, featuring speeches from Floridians who say they have been personally hurt by the president\u2019s policies. Protesters are lining up a giant, nappy-wearing baby Trump balloon. The ferocity of the backlash is evident all over America: in protest marches of \u201cthe resistance\u201d, in progressive grassroots organisations mobilising voters, in multimillionaire donors vowing to spend what it takes to defeat Trump, in steadily growing demands for impeachment, in hard-hitting newspaper reports and editorials and in constant lampooning by late-night comedians. Potential match-ups with Democratic rivals show the president in trouble, according to polls. He is lagging behind Joe Biden 53% to 40%, Bernie Sanders 51% to 42%, Kamala Harris 49% to 41%, Elizabeth Warren 49% to 42%, Pete Buttigieg 47% to 42% and Cory Booker 47% to 42%, according to a Quinnipiac University National Poll released last week. A leak of internal polling from the Trump\u2019s re-election campaign also showed him trailing Biden in several battleground states, including by double digits in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The president was reportedly furious and severed links with three of his five pollsters. John Zogby, a pollster, author and founder of John Zogby Strategies, said: \u201cAt the moment he is on the ropes. His job approval rating has settled down to 42% or 43%. He\u2019s down in every one of those key battleground states \u2013 New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.\u201d But in 2016, Trump defied the polls and conventional wisdom to beat Hillary Clinton in the electoral college, though he lost the popular vote by nearly 3m ballots. He goes into 2020 with economic growth above 3% and unemployment at its lowest rate for half a century. Zogby said: \u201cThe economy is good; it\u2019s not sputtering. We can talk about the \u2018real economy\u2019 but the fact is Americans feel pretty good right now about it. He\u2019s down among millennials but, at the same time, there\u2019s a slight uptick in his support because they\u2019re working.\u201d History is also on Trump\u2019s side: no incumbent president has lost an election since George HW Bush was defeated by Bill Clinton in 1992. Zogby added: \u201cThere are always advantages to being the incumbent. You can raise money. \u201cUnlike George HW Bush, he has 94% support among self-identified Republicans: that\u2019s high. There is a real intensity among his supporters. It\u2019s not enough to win but it\u2019s enough to say, \u2018Hey, there\u2019d better be intensity on the other side too.\u2019 Trump launched his 2016 campaign in New York, descending a golden escalator to the basement of Trump Tower, having paid people $50 to attend the event. He filed for re-election on the day he was sworn into office, but is officially launching his 2020 bid in his other spiritual home, Florida. Trump has made more visits there as president than to any other state. Mar-a-Lago, his so-called \u201cwinter White House\u201d, is in Palm Beach, while he also owns several golf clubs in the Sunshine State. Florida is also a critical swing state, the decider in the disputed 2000 election between George W Bush and Al Gore. Trump beat Clinton in the state by nearly 113,000 votes, or 1.2 percentage points, setting him on his way to the White House. The first Democratic primary debates also take place in Florida \u2013 in Miami \u2013 next week. First, on Tuesday, Trump will announce his second-term presidential run along with the first lady, Melania Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen Pence. The outdoor \u201c45 fest\u201d for the overflow crowd will feature food trucks, live music from the Guzzlers and big screens showing his speech. Among those who would like to attend, but are daunted by the prospect of a long queue, is Melanie Parham, a 59-year-old author from St Cloud, Florida. \u201cI have been very pleased with the things that President Trump has accomplished so far, but I am totally disgusted with the Democrats and how they have constantly fought him on everything since they won the House,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are determined to prevent him from accomplishing anything else as they are still sore losers of the 2016 election and they do not want him to have any more positives in his column.\u201d But Democrats in Florida are launching a counter-offensive, holding a \u201c#DefeatTrumpFL\u201d rally of their own outside the Amway Center. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) will run a live factcheck of Trump\u2019s claims during his event. Priorities USA, a political organizing group known as a Super Pac, will run a six-figure digital advertising campaign to \u201chelp cut through his noise and give voters a look at the truth about Trump\u2019s policies\u201d. Daniel Wessel, deputy director of the DNC\u2019s \u201cwar room\u201d, told CBS News: \u201cNew campaign, same broken promises. Trump will say anything to win an election, and then he never follows through. \u201cLook where we are today - healthcare costs more, prescription drugs cost more, and all Trump\u2019s done is help the rich and big corporations. The question voters need to ask is: what\u2019s he done for me? For working people, the answer is nothing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
