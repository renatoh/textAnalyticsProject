Boris Johnson\u2019s deranged, seemingly free-associated answer to the question \u201cWhat do you do to relax?\u201d \u2013 making and painting model buses out of wooden wine boxes, of course! \u2013 is obviously a case in point. But he is by no means the only offender. These questions are a minefield. All that politicians want is to maximise their potential voter base by appearing relatable. That\u2019s why Gordon Brown inexplicably declared his love for Arctic Monkeys in 2006. It\u2019s why Theresa May decided trespassing in wheat was the most unconscionable thing she had ever done. It\u2019s why Hillary Clinton invoked Pok\u00e9mon Go in talking about jobs creation. And it\u2019s why Bill de Blasio just shared screenshots of a WhatsApp conversation with his teenage son, Dante, ostensibly about how to prepare for a debate, that reads as if it was focus-grouped by androids. \u201cDante,\u201d De Blasio wrote, \u201cthe debate\u2019s coming up. I\u2019m preparing intensely, but I must admit I\u2019m a little nervous. What advice do you have for me?\u201d Five minutes later, his son replied: \u201cThanks Dad, I\u2019m glad you asked\u201d, before hitting a number of perfunctory millennial reference beats. He mentioned Tinder. He mentioned dogs. He used the word \u201cadorbs\u201d. The exchange aimed for \u201cI am relatable\u201d, but ended up hitting \u201cI fathered an Amazon Alexa\u201d. But what is the alternative? Honesty? Hardly. Last week, the New York Times asked every Democratic presidential candidate about their favourite campaign-trail comfort food, and the results were fascinating. Until recently, you could answer \u201chamburger\u201d and bask in the glow of your down-home all-American credentials \u2013 but the sitting president used to advertise McDonald\u2019s, so that\u2019s thrown a spanner in the works. Instead, Marianne Williamson fritzed out and told the truth, declaring: \u201cI have no comfort food,\u201d and now she\u2019ll never be president. At least Bernie Sanders couched his response in basic relatability: \u201cThere\u2019s too much comfort food,\u201d he said, explaining that he does not know when to stop and ends up putting on weight. Telling the truth can be disastrous. If Johnson had answered honestly and said: \u201cI have no interests because my entire life consists of the hollow pursuit of nakedly carnivorous power\u201d, his leadership campaign would be over. Instead, he described the nation\u2019s favourite hobby: painting happy passengers, on wonderful buses, made from wooden crates \u2013 and he\u2019ll be prime minister."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
