Keane has not played for Manchester United for a month but his participation in yesterday's exercise meant that the Republic's manager Mick McCarthy was able to say: \"Everyone trained, all 24 players, very nice.\" The state of Keane's fitness remained uncertain, however. A source close to the Irish squad was quoted in Dublin as saying that Keane would risk his long-term United future if he played in tomorrow's World Cup play-off first leg against Iran at Lansdowne Road. The source also said that the United player may require an operation to rectify a ligament injury, yet McCarthy felt sufficiently comfortable to joke about the situation. \"I might leave him out,\" said a relaxed McCarthy. \"People forget that before the Portugal game he hadn't played for three matches and that before the Holland game he hadn't trained. But Roy takes care of himself.\" Ultimately Keane will decide if he is fit to do himself justice, though the boost his presence would give the team is undoubted. \"Roy's very important, especially on Saturday, to control the game so we don't go too gung-ho,\" said Steve Staunton. If there is another injury-free training session this morning then McCarthy may name his team at lunchtime. With competition for places growing, McCarthy has decisions about his central defence, who will partner Keane in midfield and who will play beside Robbie Keane in attack. McCarthy's opposite number, the Iranian coach Miroslav Blazevic, has had the threat of a touchline ban for the two-legged play-off lifted. Fifa has announced that no further action will be taken against Blazevic who was sent to the stand for going on to the pitch during his side's 3-1 defeat by Bahrain last month. The Bosnian was banned from the technical area for the second leg of Iran's Asian play-off against the United Arab Emirates last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
