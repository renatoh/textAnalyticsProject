Nigeria said yesterday that Mr Taylor had slipped his minders at his villa in the south-eastern town of Calabar on Monday night. Just 48 hours earlier Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria's president, had agreed to a request from Liberia to give up Mr Taylor, whom he had granted exile under a 2003 peace deal. Remi Oyo, a spokeswoman for Mr Obasanjo, said the president had set up a panel to investigate whether Mr Taylor \"escaped or was abducted\". \"All the security people who were in charge of looking after Mr Taylor have been arrested,\" she said. Mr Taylor's disappearance confirmed the worst fears of human rights groups and prosecutors who had warned that Mr Taylor could escape if he was not detained by the Nigerian authorities. Journalists who visited Mr Taylor's riverside villa last week reported that there was little security. But despite requests from the US and the UN-backed special court in Sierra Leone, which has indicted Mr Taylor for fuelling a war there, Nigeria refused to arrest him and maintained that it was up to Liberia to \"take him into custody\". Mr Taylor's escape is embarrassing for Mr Obasanjo, who is due to visit the US tomorrow. The US is understood to have pressured Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, into requesting Mr Taylor's extradition. Nigeria's acquiescence took many observers by surprise as it sent a dangerous message to some other African leaders that they could no longer take life in exile for granted. News of Mr Taylor's disappearance will be greeted with dismay in Liberia, which is struggling to restore normality after a 14-year civil war. Mr Taylor is known to have supporters there who have threatened a return to the chaos that marked his rule. Kilari Anand Paul, an Indian-American evangelist who describes himself as Mr Taylor's \"spiritual adviser\", told AFP yesterday that Mr Taylor had agreed to stand trial in The Hague. \"He has also agreed to go to Liberia, but he has totally refused to go to Sierra Leone and face charges there,\" said Mr Paul. He said that Mr Taylor had submitted political asylum requests to Syria, Libya, Venezuela and Ethiopia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
