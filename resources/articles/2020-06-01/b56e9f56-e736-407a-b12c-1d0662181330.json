Anything but a victory for Manchester City when they travel to face Chelsea on Thursday night would see Liverpool crowned champions for the first time since 1990 after a scintillating display saw the champions-elect sweep to a 4-0 victory over Crystal Palace at Anfield on Wednesday thanks to goals from Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah, Fabinho and Sadio Man\u00e9. Klopp, who admitted he will watch the match at Stamford Bridge \u2013 although \u201cnot to prepare a celebration\u201d but because Liverpool face City in their next fixture \u2013 heaped praise on his players after they recorded a 23rd consecutive victory at Anfield that means they require just two points to seal a first Premier League title. \u201cYou should not underestimate how much this team wants it. You should not,\u201d he said. \u201cThis team really wants it. They want to fulfil the wishes of the people at home. Really. We all have a common dream but we have to work for it and we have to work our way for it. We cannot play like other teams but we can play pretty good stuff and that\u2019s what the boys did tonight.\u201d Klopp added: \u201cI don\u2019t think the game could have been better. My boys played like everyone was in the stadium. Imagine if this stadium was full today and people could experience that performance live? I liked it a lot. I liked the game so much. 4-0 up in 87th minute and four of our players chasing a Crystal Palace player like he has the only ball in the world.\u201d Klopp also revealed that he had given a speech before the game in an attempt to inspire them to victory, while Alexander-Arnold admitted the title is now within touching distance. \u201cWe know we\u2019re in that position but we won\u2019t get overly excited,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of us will watch it tomorrow but we know Man City are a very good team. We\u2019ve still got to prepare for the game next week regardless. We\u2019ve still got seven games left I think and we\u2019re going to try and get all 21 points from those games. It\u2019s great to be back at Anfield after what has gone on. It couldn\u2019t have gone any better for us, so we\u2019re made up with the win.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
