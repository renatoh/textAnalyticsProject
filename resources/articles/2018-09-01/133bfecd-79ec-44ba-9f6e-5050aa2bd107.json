Come November we will sit down and see the routes for the different races, the Giro and Tour, make a plan and go from there.\u201d The Tour winner said he did not anticipate any issues with the four-times winner Chris Froome, who finished third in this year\u2019s race, and will be his teammate again if he signs a new deal with Sky. \u201cIt worked well for us this year, we were honest with each other and there was always a good atmosphere.\u201d Thomas added that he has felt determined to take full advantage of the time after his Tour win rather than begin making concrete plans for the future. \u201cThere is always another race around the corner, so I wanted to enjoy it and make the most of it. I wanted to live in the moment and go from there when the time comes. \u201cSince the Tour I\u2019ve had a few nights out, I went to the Emirates for an Arsenal game, there was the homecoming in Cardiff, a couple of criterium, but a lot of late nights and early mornings. \u201cThere have been some interviews, getting stitched up over helmets\u201d \u2013 a reference to an interview in the Sunday Times when he stated he was in favour of cycle helmets being made compulsory. \u201cIt\u2019s been a whirlwind. There has been no time to enjoy it and chill out.\u201d Thomas spent part of Saturday at the Maindy track in Cardiff, where he began racing, and he was surprised by the reception. \u201cThere were 170 kids there or something, there were a lot of things to sign.\u201d He expects Sunday\u2019s stage across south Wales from Pembry to Newport \u2013 where the national indoor velodrome is about to be named in his honour \u2013 to be \u201cinsane\u201d. \u201cI want to enjoy it, racing on home roads isn\u2019t something we get to do very often. I want to lap it up. Performance-wise I\u2019m not going to set the world alight. I\u2019ve not done much for the last month. \u201cI\u2019ve been here there and everywhere because it\u2019s not every day that you win the Tour. I\u2019m knackered, I\u2019ve been so busy since the Tour that I\u2019ve not really recovered.\u201d Thomas and Froome conceded that in the next few days they are likely to play second fiddle to their Dutch teammate Wout Poels, given that both feel they are well off their best form. Froome added that his decision to race in Britain rather than defend his title at the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a was largely due to the arrival of his and his wife\u2019s second child shortly after the Tour. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to step back from Grand Tours and gather myself a bit,\u201d he said. The two Team Sky leaders have been shortlisted for the world road race championships in Innsbruck at the end of the month, but Thomas as good as said here that he will not race, while Froome will assess his form after this week, but is also unlikely to ride, although the course would suit his climbing skills well. \u201cI think I have pushed the envelope as far as I can this season,\u201d said Froome, who began racing earlier than usual in order to be in his best form for the Giro d\u2019Italia in mid-May. \u201cI took a break after the Tour, I\u2019ve been training well but the worlds will be a brutal race.\u201d Before the Giro, Froome tackled the world championships course in Innsbruck during the Tour of the Alps and was suitably impressed. \u201cThere is over 5,000 metres of climbing, so unless you are in absolutely top condition it\u2019s not a race where you can sit in the wheels. It will show exactly what form you are in.\u201d The consensus is that this Tour of Britain will be decided on Thursday and Friday when the race takes in the climb of Whinlatter Pass in the Lake District three times, with a short, tough team-time trial on the Thursday. Whatever happens there, the pair have moved on a long way since the last time they teamed up at this race, in 2009 for the Barloworld squad, when the most significant thing Thomas could remember was that the race went through the Somerset town of Frome, to the team\u2019s great amusement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
