Now, at last, Mark Cornell, chief executive of the Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG), which has 10 auditoriums in central London plus many more elsewhere in the UK, has fessed up. \u201cAudiences first have to navigate queues, then fold themselves into seats designed like torture instruments, must dine on a packet of crisps or a tub of ice cream, and often endure temperatures fluctuating between Siberia and the subcontinent,\u201d he said at industry body UK Theatre\u2019s annual symposium last Monday. Cornell also suggested that theatres must look to cinemas, which offer designer seats as well as more choice of food and drink. Fine, provided the slurping and munching do not disturb other cinemagoers. And yet this is a bit rich coming from ATG, which, with a few exceptions, such as its Piccadilly theatre, has been tardy improving its West End venues. I\u2019m not sure if I can cope again with its Harold Pinter theatre, formerly the Comedy. No laughing matter as regards its seats and bars. Cornell should look to Cameron Mackintosh, who has spent tens of millions on his theatres, such as the Victoria Palace and the Prince of Wales, while Andrew Lloyd Webber is forking out a fortune on his Theatre Royal Drury Lane. It\u2019s almost 60 years since Edna O\u2019Brien was brave enough to publish her first novel The Country Girls, which broke the silence on sex in the very conservative Ireland of the 1950s. It was banned in her homeland, and some copies that did get through were burned. Six decades on, and the 88-year-old O\u2019Brien is just as gutsy. She has recently been to north-east Nigeria to talk to the families of girls abducted by the Islamist group Boko Haram. From her conversations, she has written a powerful novel, Girl, to be published by Faber in early September. Before that, the BBC One arts series Imagine\u2026 will kick off its July season with a terrific profile of O\u2019Brien. One story she relates to Alan Yentob is how she took \u00a315,000 in cash as a gift to the families, but discovered during the flight that she would not be allowed to enter Nigeria with such a huge sum. The ever-resourceful O\u2019Brien stuffed the notes into, well, something rather private, and got through. The last item on ITV\u2019s News at Ten on Wednesday last week was about how Britain established its empire in India. \u201cWhy now?\u201d, I pondered. Then up popped film director Gurinder Chadha to explain how little British children know about empire, followed by India wallah William Dalrymple to add his rupee\u2019s worth. Only towards the end did I realise, thanks to a small clip, that this was all about ITV\u2019s next big drama series, Beecham House. Then, immediately after the news, came a shot of actor Tom Bateman and an announcer stating he would be on Thursday\u2019s Good Morning Britain chatting about, guess what, Beecham House! What blatant plugging."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
