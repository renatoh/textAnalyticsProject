Even the leading presidential candidate, Governor Adams Brooke (campaign slogan: \"Family Matters\") stops by for a visit. But then the smallest and sickest of her vast, disadvantaged litter dies. And then another. And then another. The town's self-important rejoicing turns to grief, embarrassment and hostility. Manda's mass production had seemed a collective triumph; no one wants to deal with the grim aftermath. Leland Vaughn, the kind but over-enthusiastic local pastor who persuaded Manda to refuse fetal reduction, is left with egg on his face and blood on his hands - one has the feeling he's not sure which is worse. Just up the road, Margaret Prickett, with the help of her 13-year-old daughter Polly, is fighting her own little war against the perils of mass production. Her small organic dairy farm, her gorgeous cheeses wrought from the milk of 22 pampered Jerseys, cannot compete against the abundant but far less creamy outpourings of the profitable Holstein herds that roam the chemically enhanced acres of rural Virginia. So Pastor Vaughn has another bright idea: he coaxes a reluctant Margaret to produce an enormous cheese (1,235 lbs) and transport it to Washington as a gift to the new president, Brooke. Crazy stunt? But it was performed before, in 1802, when a vast Cheshire wheel was carted to the capital by Massachusetts Baptists to celebrate the election of Thomas Jefferson and his pledge of religious freedom. It is the remarkable philosophy of Jefferson that underpins this timely, clever and passionately humane satire on modern American politics. Margaret's undeclared lover, the pastor's innocent and faithful son August, is a Jefferson impersonator who consults his icon in moments of indecision. Polly's history teacher, Harvey Marsh, also quotes Jefferson, employing the great man's rhetoric as a wedge to prise the girl away from family and friends. Polly is like a young America - brilliant and naive, breathtakingly wonderful but horribly open to corruption by cynics who misuse true revolutionary slogans in their selfish quest for personal power. Nor is Marsh the only one playing that game. In his all-important pre-election speech, Governor Brooke quotes the Prickett motto - Omnis pecuniae pecus fundamentum (the herd is the foundation of all wealth) - and claims it was a saying taught to him by his own grandfather. From such small, self-serving lies do great corruptions grow. Sheri Holman herself is the opposite of a mass-produced writer - she is an original of extraordinary quality. Her first book, A Stolen Tongue, followed a 15th-century pilgrimage from Germany to the Sinai. Her second novel, The Dress Lodger, was another best-selling triumph, set in cholera-stricken England circa 1831. In this, her third novel, Holman has jumped another couple of centuries to land in modern times and her own birthplace, rural Virginia, but she has retained her unique recipe: ideas to provoke, humour to entertain, and characters we can unreservedly love. \u00b7 Helen Falconer's Sky High is published by Faber."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
