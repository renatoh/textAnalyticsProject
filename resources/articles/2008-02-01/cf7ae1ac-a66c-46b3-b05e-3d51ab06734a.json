With Aston Villa also having won against Newcastle earlier in the day, Liverpool now sit sixth in the Premier League, one point behind Villa and four behind Everton, albeit with two games in hand on both teams. With Yakubu dropped as punishment for his late return from the African Cup of Nations, Everton struggled to break down Reading for much of the game, and it was left to Phil Jagielka to score the only goal of the game 15 minutes into the second half. After Mikel Arteta's corner was only half cleared by Reading, Leon Osman floated a cross back into the middle of the area from the right, and Jagielka was on hand to head past Marcus Hahnemann. The win means Everton are now unbeaten in six league games, but also represented Reading's seventh consecutive defeat, and the Royals slipped into the relegation zone this afternoon after Birmingham moved above them on goal difference following a 1-1 draw at West Ham. The Hammers had appeared in control after Freddie Ljungberg gave them the lead six minutes in, coming close to extending their lead more than once before before Lucas Neill brought down James McFadden in the area ten minutes later. McFadden duly converted the penalty and, despite continuing to dominate, West Ham were unable to restore their advantage. Instead they finished the game level and on ten men, after Lee Bowyer was sent off for a reckless challenge on Damien Johnson. Bolton had also appeared on course for a draw before Lassana Diarra's late strike gave Portsmouth all three points at the Reebok Stadium. Latching on to a pass from Kanu inside the area, Diarra lashed the ball past Jussi Jaaskelainen with 10 minutes remaining to lift Portsmouth to seventh in the league and end a run of three consecutive clean sheets for the Trotters. The result also allowed Sunderland to climb above Bolton and into 14th after they beat Wigan 2-0 at the Stadium of Light. Dickson Etuhu scored the opener, heading past Chris Kirkland after Dean Whitehead's free-kick from the right found him unmarked on the edge of the six yard box, before Daryl Murphy thrashed home a stunning drive from 25 yards to make the game safe. Tottenham continued their fine form under Juande Ramos with a 3-0 win at Derby. The result wasn't as routine as it may appear, with Robbie Keane only breaking the deadlock in the 67th minute, but thereafter the result was never in doubt, with Younes Kaboul and Dimitar Berbatov adding gloss to the scoreline, the latter from the penalty spot after Alan Stubbs handled in the area. Afonso Alves, meanwhile, made his debut for Middlesbrough during their 1-0 home win over Fulham. The only goal of the game was scored before he arrived, however, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re beating Antti Niemi from close range."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
