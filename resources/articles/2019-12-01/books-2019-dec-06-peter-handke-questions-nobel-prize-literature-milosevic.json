The Austrian author\u2019s Nobel prize win in October has been widely criticised by writers and politicians over his stance on the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. A petition signed by almost 60,000 people is calling on the Nobel committee to revoke the award from the \u201capologist for the \u2018butcher of Balkans\u2019 Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u201d. Handke spoke at Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s funeral in 2006, calling him \u201ca rather tragic man\u201d. The petition is due to be delivered by protesters on 10 December in Stockholm, when Handke is scheduled to receive his SEK9m (\u00a3743,000) prize. After an awkward moment during which the room was induced to sing Happy Birthday to the author, Handke was asked at the press conference about the polarised response to his win. He responded: \u201cThis is a very long story. To tell this story here, I think it\u2019s not the moment.\u201d Asked about the planned protests next week, Handke reminisced about a visit to Norway in 2014, when he won the Ibsen award. \u201cThere were a lot of protests when I went to the National Theatre of Oslo. A lot of shouting of \u2018fascist, fascist\u2019. I wanted to talk to these ladies and gentlemen but they didn\u2019t want to talk to me,\u201d he said. In his speech accepting that prize, he told his critics: \u201cGo to hell, where you already are.\u201d Handke was asked by Peter Maass, a journalist at the Intercept, if he would say that the Srebrenica massacre, where almost 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, had happened. Handke responded by talking about a letter he had been sent by an anonymous critic which he said was sent with a piece of toilet paper, \u201cwhich had a calligraphy of shit\u201d. After finishing, he told Maass: \u201cI prefer toilet paper, an anonymous letter with toilet paper inside, to your empty and ignorant questions.\u201d Handke\u2019s lack of straight answers is unlikely to put the controversy to rest, with the Nobel Foundation and the Swedish Academy also under fire over their choice. Anders Olsson, chair of the Nobel committee, has told critics that \u201cthe ambition is to celebrate his extraordinary literary work, not the person. But earlier this week, two members of the external committee set up to oversee reforms in the controversy-prone Swedish Academy resigned, with one, journalist Gun-Britt Sundstr\u00f6m, blaming her departure on Handke\u2019s victory. \u201cThe choice of 2019 laureate was not just a choice about a body of work, it has also been interpreted, both inside the academy and outside, as a defence of the stance that literature is above \u2018politics\u2019,\u201d she told Dagens Nyheter. \u201cThat is not my ideology.\u201d Earlier on Friday, Peter Englund, the former permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, said he would not attend the ceremonies because to celebrated Handke\u2019s win \u201cwould be gross hypocrisy on my part\u201d. Jonas Ekl\u00f6f, editor in chief of Swedish books magazine Vi L\u00e4ser, was at the press conference. He said that the feeling among Swedish journalists covering the Nobel \u201chas been fatigue, exhaustion and ... \u2018Not again!\u2019 A feeling that little has to do with literature right now.\u201d \u201cThere is still a lot of turbulence within the academy, with new boycotts and two out of five members leaving the Nobel committee in only the last week,\u201d said Ekl\u00f6f. \u201cAbout today, what can I say: it was strange \u2013 especially the birthday song to Handke \u2013 and a little bit awkward, but not as uncomfortable as one might have expected. Feeling right now: just want to go home and have a glass of wine and read Flights.\u201d Flights is a novel by the Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk, winner of the 2018 Nobel prize for literature. Her win was announced on the same day as Handke\u2019s, due to the postponement of last year\u2019s prize. She is using her winnings to fund a foundation to support the work of writers and translators which will help \u201cdescribe the reality in which xenophobic and nationalist sentiments are growing dangerously quickly\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
