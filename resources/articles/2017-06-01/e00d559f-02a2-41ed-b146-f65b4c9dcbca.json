Everyone, it seems, has a Corby story, and no story is too ancient or too silly to recount. As Guardian Australia and ABC\u2019s Media Watch showed earlier in the week, the rolling news channels went to town on the story, and the madness wasn\u2019t just confined to TV. News Corp\u2019s popular website news.com.au revisited an old feud between media personality Kate Langbroek and Corby which took place more than 10 years ago. Corby said the KIIS FM radio host had failed to identify herself as a member of the media when she visited the convicted drug smuggler in jail \u2013 and gave her \u201clollies and tampons\u201d. In her 2006 memoir written with Kathryn Bonella, My Story, Corby took issue with Langbroek for milking the visit in subsequent media appearances. Langbroek denies Corby\u2019s version of events. But it was Corby\u2019s newly minted Instagram account which provided much of the daily fodder for the media in the absence of Corby making an actual public appearance or giving a paid interview \u2013 or even an unpaid one \u2013 to exploit. The Daily Mail raced to compare the Gold Coast\u2019s Corby with Sydney publicity executive Roxy Jacenko, by pitting the two women together in a battle for Instagram followers which neither signed up for. \u201cIn a matter of days convicted drug trafficker Schapelle Corby has amassed over 171,000 followers on her newly launched Instagram account,\u201d the Mail reported. \u201cThis means she has now overtaken Australia\u2019s PR maven and Instagram queen Roxy Jacenko, who has 170,000 followers and has uploaded almost 4,000 posts over the years.\u201d Corby now has 185,000 followers and rising. The Sydney Morning Herald also feasted on Corby\u2019s Instagram feed, crafting an article around a snap of the two dogs she had to leave behind. \u201cCorby has always loved dogs,\u201d wrote seasoned foreign correspondent Jewel Topsfield. \u201cWhen she was in jail, Mercedes brought her a puppy called Stanley \u2013 \u2018one of the puffball dogs that old people usually have\u2019. She wrote she pampered him more than any Paris Hilton pooch, until she reluctantly had to give him back to Mercedes because there were too many Muslims in her cell who couldn\u2019t go near him for religious reasons.\u201d But the Herald outdid itself with a startling new angle about Corby and the rugby league State of Origin game on Wednesday night, a huge TV event which attracted more than 3.5 million viewers. \u201cNSW are bracing for a potential collision course with Schapelle Corby and the media circus when they check into the Sofitel in Brisbane on Tuesday,\u201d the SMH reported. The Herald stuck with the story even though the NSW Rugby League chief executive, David Trodden, insisted the Blues won\u2019t be distracted. As so it proved. Fairfax bidders take their turn with Senate As two private equity firms descend on Fairfax Media\u2019s books for a potential $2.7bn takeover they might be asking themselves how the wall-to-wall Corby coverage fits with the company\u2019s claim to be an outlet for quality journalism rather than just a media company attached to a money-making property website called Domain. The two suitors, TPG Capital and Hellman &amp; Friedman, will be meeting with the Fairfax board over the next few days, and Weekly Beast understands the latter has accepted an invitation to appear before a Senate committee examining public interest journalism. TPG Capital gave evidence to the committee last month, telling senators it would abide by the 1988 Fairfax charter of editorial independence and would be \u201cresponsible stewards\u201d of quality journalism. Now Hellman &amp; Friedman will be expected to follow suit. Auntie bites back News Corp joined Fairfax Media chief Greg Hywood this week in publicly blaming the ABC for damaging its viability as a business by operating in the digital space. The Daily Telegraph\u2019s national political editor Sharri Markson argued that one of the greatest threats to quality journalism in Australia was \u2026 the ABC. Why? because it didn\u2019t confine itself to TV and radio but dared to put its content online, and because it spent \u201c$360,000 a year of taxpayer dollars buying up search terms to lift its Google rankings\u201d. \u201cAnd so, the public broadcaster towers in the Australian media landscape like a lazy giant, while other media stables have to fight and innovate,\u201d she wrote. On Thursday the ABC volleyed back, publishing a lengthy analysis of the way in which newspapers have historically tried to influence the ABC\u2019s independence via Late Night Live. \u201cHow the newspapers tried to kill an independent ABC news before it even began\u201d marks the 70th anniversary of its first \u201ctruly independent\u201d news bulletin on Sunday 1 June, 1947. According to the ABC, as far back as 1936 Sir Keith Murdoch, Rupert\u2019s father, bitterly opposed the ABC broadcasting a news bulletin at 7pm because it might undermine his profitable business model. The first bulletin\u2019s preamble was: \u201cThis is the news that you don\u2019t have to fetch and carry. It comes to you with the turn of the knob that a child can turn. Nobody has to bring it home, it is there. It is the butterfly that flies into your net. The view you can get without having to go to your window.\u201d Chaos at Fairfax as the axe hangs The way Fairfax is managing the departure of one quarter of its newsroom \u2013 125 journalists will leave the mastheads \u2013 has been described as \u201cstaggeringly incompetent\u201d. Journalists have told Weekly Beast the process is in chaos because the payout estimates given to staff who put their hands up were inaccurate. By Friday, people who applied for voluntary redundancy were expected to have been told whether their applications had been approved. It is believed the company got the numbers it required but not in the right departments, meaning some people will be knocked back and others will be forced to take redundancy. A couple of the names who have gone public about leaving are digital guru Stephen Hutcheon, who started at the Herald 35 years ago, and music writer Bernard Zuel, a 25-year veteran of the paper. One source says an entire department in one area of editorial has applied for redundancy. Now due to the stuff-up in the estimates the painful process will drag on well into next week, leaving the workforce in limbo. The Fairfax Media editorial director, Sean Aylmer, has admitted the error in a memo to staff. \u201cAs many of you are aware, we have identified errors in some estimates,\u201d Aylmer wrote to staff as the disaster unfolded. \u201cThis predominantly relates to the incorrect inclusion of casual service and some calculation errors. We have been working as fast as possible to reissue the correct estimates to the affected staff. In some cases we are giving those employees extensions to indicate if they want to proceed with their VR application based on the revised estimate. We recognise this is a very challenging period and appreciate your patience as we work through all of the applications. We hope to advise people as soon as possible if their application has been successful.\u201d The Media, Arts and Entertainment Alliance is warning staff at the Age, Australian Financial Review and SMH to check their figures and get in touch with the union before signing anything. Boy band fronts media At an event this week at Parliament House to express support for the government\u2019s media package, senior executives from major media companies gathered en masse. They were there to help support efforts to abolish the two-out-of-three rule, which restricts cross-media ownership by preventing moguls from controlling a free-to-air TV station, newspapers and radio stations in the same market. While the high-powered group may not have influenced the outcome of the bill, they did leave a lasting impression and it wasn\u2019t a positive one. Among the men in suits who represented some of the country\u2019s major media organisations were Foxtel CEO Peter Tonagh, Seven West Media chief Tim Worner, Nine CEO Hugh Marks, Ten Network chief Paul Anderson, Fairfax CEO Greg Hywood, Macquarie Media COO Adam Lang and News Corp executive chair Michael Miller. There was just one woman: NOVA CEO Cath O\u2019Connor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
