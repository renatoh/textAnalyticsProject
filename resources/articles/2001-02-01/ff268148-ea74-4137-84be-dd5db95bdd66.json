Up to 1,300 students in 70 British secondary schools took a short version of the US scholastic aptitude tests, known as SATs, last year, involving short verbal reasoning and maths tests, in a study commissioned by millionaire philanthropist Peter Lampl, an adviser to the Higher Education Funding Council for England. In the study, carried out by the National Foundation for Educational Research, 30 students from state schools scored more than 1,200 in the tests - a level considered sufficient for entry to American ivy league universities, where the test is almost universal. But only one achieved 3 As at A-level, the entry requirement for Oxbridge. Throughout the study, SATs scores \"were only modestly associated\" with A-level grades. Mr Lampl said the results could mean that the test could complement A-levels and broaden university intake without lowering standards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
