Villa confirmed that there had been talks with a representative for the brothers but cast significant doubt on a deal being finalised. \"The directors of Aston Villa plc confirm that they have received a preliminary approach from Mr Michael Neville on behalf of a consortium group which could lead to an offer for the company,\" said the club's statement to the Stock Exchange. \"However, the board have not met with any other members of the consortium group nor received any confirmation of the availability of sufficient funding to support any potential offer and so they can only treat the approach as speculative at this stage.\" The reported offer values the club's equity at 560p per share, almost 150p more than the football financier Ray Ranson offered earlier this year in a bid that valued Villa at around \u00a348m. However, few fans will be concerned with what the major shareholders, Doug Ellis and Jack Petchey, will earn from the deal. The board insisted it would work to guarantee that the club's financial future would be secure under any takeover. \"Your board will continue to look at maximising shareholder value and also ensuring that the club is sufficiently funded for the future,\" the statement added. It is understood that further meetings between Villa directors and the consortium are scheduled for later in the week, but a spokeswoman for the Comers was giving nothing away yesterday and said: \"We are not at liberty to comment. We can't deny or confirm anything. If we put a statement out it will be in the later part of the week, on Thursday or Friday.\" Neville, a mergers and acquisitions specialist with directorships in the broadcasting industry, was equally circumspect, citing Stock Exchange rules. Even so, the 49-year-old did proffer his credentials, saying: \"I am a lifelong Villa fan and have been since I was about nine years old. I'm a local businessman, I grew up in Erdington and live here [in Solihull] now. Other than that I have no comment to make.\" Though the consortium's motives are unclear, it is known that Villa own around 40 acres of real estate in the Birmingham area beyond the 60 acres of land occupied by the stadium and Bodymoor Heath training ground. This would offer the bidders leverage for their approach, although their financing method remains equally opaque. A report on Sunday suggested there were two overseas businessmen also willing to underwrite part of the bid but suggestions that Comer Homes Group has assets of \u00a31bn appear to be erroneous. The Comers share directorships in 28 companies with their interests, principally property development and letting firms, worth a net \u00a325m to their shareholders. The brothers began as plasterers but were pioneers of the luxury apartment market and are no strangers to major investments, having acquired a site in Weymouth for \u00a330m three years ago. \"It is important we don't just assume anything is better than Doug Ellis,\" said Dave Woodhall of the Heroes and Villans fanzine. \"A takeover of the club is only good for Villa if it takes the club forward. Sometimes you have got to be careful what you wish for.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
