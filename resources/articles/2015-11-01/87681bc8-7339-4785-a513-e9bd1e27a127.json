The Australian Moya Dodd, one of only three women on Fifa\u2019s executive committee, has been lobbying the reform committee to force a step change in the underrepresentation and under-resourcing of women\u2019s football as part of the reform process precipitated by the meltdown of the world governing body. In the letter the Athlete Ally organisation has called on Fran\u00e7ois Carrard, the head of Fifa\u2019s reform committee, to introduce immediate measures to ensure that at least 30% of positions on the Fifa ex-co are held by women. \u201cThis is not only what\u2019s fair and right. It\u2019s also what\u2019s best for the sport that is in dire need of reform,\u201d the letter says. The first woman was not formally voted on to the Fifa executive committee until 2013, in Burundi\u2019s Lydia Nsekera, when Dodd and Sonia Bien-Aime from Turks &amp; Caicos were also co-opted. The letter recommends the 30% target be extended to all other roles within the game at all levels within a reasonable period of time. \u201cIn the 111 years since Fifa was formed women are still vastly under-represented at every level of the world\u2019s most loved game,\u201d it said. \u201cAlthough Fifa outlaws discrimination based on gender and is a recent signatory of the Brighton + Helsinki Declaration, only three of the 26 ExCo members are women; just two of 209 member association presidents are women, and women make up less than one percent of the voting population in the Fifa Congress. This is not Fair Play.\u201d Dodd had earlier delivered a submission to the reform committee in an attempt to address the \u201cprofound injustice\u201d in the lack of diversity in football\u2019s senior decision-making structures. Carrard\u2019s committee, set to come up with concrete proposals by December to be voted on at the Fifa congress in February that will decide on a new president, has been controversial. External figures have argued it is compromised by the presence of each of the continental confederations around the table and the preponderance of sports governing body insiders. Interim proposals delivered last month by Carrard suggest a range of reforms including the separation of the political and management functions of Fifa, term limits and greater financial transparency and control. The proposals referred to the \u201cneed to include more women to create a more diverse decision-making environment and culture\u201d and recommended that each confederation should have at least one voting Fifa executive committee seat for women. But it stopped short of setting a target for female representation. The letter said only by setting a target could Fifa effect a culture shift within the game. \u201cWith 30%, women cease to be regarded as a special interest group and become \u2018normalised\u2019 as part of the mainstream. No wonder so many governments have targets of 30% or more women,\u201d it said. \u201cFrance, Germany, Italy and Holland are among them. Further, it is still the case that many girls grow into women without having the chance to experience the joy of the game. Under-resourcing reinforces the perception that football is a game for men, confining women to the margins and creating an environment for discrimination.\u201d The letter concluded: \u201cFootball cannot wait, and women should not be asked to wait any longer. The Reform Committee must hear this call to action and look to accelerate gender inclusion by recommending these proposals for immediate enactment.\u201d Full list of signatories (* denotes Olympic athlete) Mary Harvey, U.S. Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* (retired) Donna de Varona, U.S. Swimming* (retired), Chairman, 1999 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup Nancy Hogshead Makar, US Swimming (retired) Mark Tewksbury, Canada Swimming* (retired) Greg Louganis, US Diving* (retired) James Blake, US Tennis* (retired) Kenneth Faried, Denver Nuggets, NBA Brendon Ayanbadejo, Baltimore Ravens, NFL (retired) Chris Kluwe, Minnesota Vikings, NFL (retired) Michael Sam, University of Missouri, 2013 SEC Defensive Player of the Year Michelle Akers, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* (retired) Amanda Cromwell, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* (retired) Lori Lindsey, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* (retired) Carla Overbeck, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* (retired) Cindy Parlow Cone, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* (retired) Michelle French, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* (retired) Shannon MacMillan, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* (retired) Tiffany Roberts Sahaydak, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* (retired) Danielle Slaton, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* (retired) Christie Welsh, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* (retired) Sara Whalen, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* (retired) John O\u2019Brien, US Men\u2019s National Soccer Team* (retired) Eli Wolff, US Men\u2019s Paralympic Soccer Team* (retired) Robbie Rogers, LA Galaxy Crystal Dunn, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team Ashlyn Harris, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team Meghan Klingenberg, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team Ali Krieger, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* Megan Rapinoe, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* Becky Sauerbrunn, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* Abby Wambach, US Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* Sally Shipard, Australia Women\u2019s National Soccer Team (retired) Michelle Heyman, Australia Women\u2019s National Soccer Team Emily Van Egmond, Australia Women\u2019s National Soccer Team Kaylyn Kyle, Canada Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* Carmelina Moscato, Canada Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* Rhian Wilkinson, Canada Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* Casey Stoney, England Women\u2019s National Soccer Team* Belle Brockhoff, Australia Snowboarding* Callan ChythlookSifsof, US Snowboarding* Simona Meiler, Switzerland Snowboarding* Alex Duckworth, Canada Snowboarding* Charline Labonte\u0301, Canada Hockey* Eric Mitchell, Canada Ski Jumping (retired)* Anastasia Bucsis, Canada Speed Skating* Cameron Myler, US Luge* (retired) Caryn Davis, US Rowing* (retired) Ginny Gilder, US Rowing* (retired) Esther Lofgren, US Rowing* Chris Mosier, US Duathlon Vicky LeBlanc, Canada Softball (retired)* Rosie Cossar, Canada Gymnastics* (retired) Connor Taras, Canada Kayaking (retired) Mark Tewksbury, Canada Swimming (retired)* Connor Taras, 2011 Pan Am Kayak Silver Medalist, Canada (retired) Rosie Cossar, Canada Rhythmic Gymnastics (retired)* Vicky LeBlanc, Canada Softball (retired)* Rennae Stubbs, Australia Tennis (retired)* Eric Mitchell, Canada Ski Jumping (retired)* Anastasia Bucsis, Canada Speed Skating* Sinead Farrelly, Boston Breakers, NWSL Julie King, Boston Breakers, NWSL Lauren Lazo, Boston Breakers, NWSL Katie Scho\u0308pfer, Boston Breakers, NWSL McCall Zerboni, Boston Breakers, NWSL Jennifer Hoy, Chicago Red Stars, NWSL Alyssa Mautz, Chicago Red Stars, NWSL Yael Averbuch, FC Kansas City, NWSL Rachael Axon, Houston Dash, NWSL Tiffany McCarty, Houston Dash, NWSL Stephanie Ochs, Houston Dash, NWSL Toni Pressley, Orlando Pride, NWSL Michelle Betos, Portland Thorns, NWSL Keelin Winters, Seattle Reign, NWSL Beverly Yanez, Seattle Reign, NWSL Laura Harvey, Seattle Reign (coach), NWSL Amanda DaCosta, Washington Spirit, NWSL Laura del Rio, Washington Spirit, NWSL Tori Huster, Washington Spirit, NWSL Joanna Lohman, Washington Spirit, NWSL Megan Oyster, Washington Spirit, NWSL Elizabeth Eddy, Western New York Flash, NWSL Kristin Bernert, Senior Vice President, Business &amp; Basketball Operations, NY Liberty Kelly Krauskopf, President &amp; General Manager, Indiana Fever Chris Sienko, Chief Operating Officer &amp; General Manager, Connecticut Sun Alisha Valavanis, President &amp; General Manager, Seattle Storm Athlete Ally Champion Women Force 10 Enterprises (owners, Seattle Storm) GO!
