But just behind them, a feminist uprising of sorts was in full swing. Inside a landmark hotel on the seafront strip in the South of France, loud calls for positive discrimination in favour of women's films were being voiced. The impact of British director Andrea Arnold's public anger about the failure to include a female director in the prestigious Palme D'Or line-up continues to stir controversy at the annual celebration of world cinema. Speakers at a Beyond Borders diversity symposium echoed Arnold's complaint that while films from around the globe may have made the shortlist for the annual prize, directors drawn from half of the population have been ignored. At the opening of the festival on Wednesday the acclaimed director of Fish Tank and Wuthering Heights, who this year sits on the Palme D'Or jury alongside Ewan McGregor, said that the lack of women in the selection was \"a great pity and a great disappointment\", adding that it reflected badly on the film industry. On the beach this weekend after the premiere of the British film, Broken, Arnold was unrepentant, although still limited by the Cannes convention of jury \"purdah\". \"I wanted to put it out there,\" she said. \"I don't want to see positive discrimination at Cannes though. I don't think any director should be included because of who they are.\" The allegation that unworthy films made by directors from the developing world, or from conflict zones, are included in the Cannes jury's selection in spite of their low quality was dismissed by Arnold. \"That is only one reading of what happens. I would say instead that the jury includes films that are political and have something to say,\" she said. The lack of a film directed by a woman on the list of 22 in contention this year has provoked fiery debate across France. As the festival opened the newspaper Le Monde carried a protest letter from the feminist collective La Barbe, which was signed by notable French female film-makers, including Virginie Despentes, Coline Serreau and Fanny Cotten\u00e7on. \"Men love their women to have depth, but only when it comes to their cleavage,\" the letter argued. The row comes at a time when the commercial success of films aimed at women is evident. The box office appeal of Kristen Wiig in the comedy Bridesmaids and of the Thatcher biopic The Iron Lady, described on Friday by its British producer Damian Jones as a \"mother and daughter film that brought in the whole family\", have reached huge neglected audiences. But while there are few women directors, there is an increasing female presence behind the scenes in Britain. BBC Films and Film4 are both run by women and at least three of the producers who have managed to bring British productions to premiere in Cannes this summer are female. Nira Park, the producer of hits such as Shaun of The Dead, has brought out the Ben Wheatley film Sightseers, while Rebecca O'Brien has brought Ken Loach's Palme D'Or contender The Angels' Share and Dixie Linder has brought Broken, the first film from British theatre director Rufus Norris. \"Gender is not part of how I see things when I look for a director,\" said Linder this weekend after the film opened the festival's Critic's Week programme. \"In fact I feel that positive discrimination could actually be detrimental. Certainly if they had chosen my film for Cannes simply because I was a woman producer, I would not like it.\" Linder, whose film stars Tim Roth alongside 12-year-old newcomer Eloise Laurence, added that in her experience finding finance for a film directed by a newcomer such as Norris, despite his theatrical record, was more difficult than for a more established woman director, such as Sam Taylor Wood. Christine Langan, the creative head of BBC Films, said that Britain was lucky to have several strong female directors but that it is unfair to expect them to deliver Palme D'Or prospects every year. \"While people like Andrea Arnold and Lynne Ramsay are fantastic role models, their rate of film-making would have to increase considerably to create a steady flow of competitors to Cannes,\" she said. \"I would love to feel that no girl growing up today should think that it is something she could not do, but I don't approach it from a gender point of view. You get very embroiled in each film project and while BBC Films likes to encourage female talent, I am really focused on the quality of the production and so become fairly blind to gender.\" Until this year it had looked as if everything was moving towards greater balance, both at Cannes and in the wider the film industry. Not only did Kathryn Bigelow win the first directing Oscar for a woman with The Hurt Locker in 2010, but there were four women directors in the line-up of 18 films competing for the top prize at Cannes last summer: the Australian Julia Leigh, Japanese director Naomi Kawase, the French actress and writer Ma\u00efwenn Le Besco and Ramsay, the Scottish director selected for We Need To Talk About Kevin. And yet the only woman to win the award in 65 years remains Jane Campion, who received the Palme D'Or in 1993 for The Piano. Three years ago Campion's first new film for nine years, Bright Star, about the poet John Keats, was included in the main competition and the director used the platform to criticise the continued dearth of female directors. \"The studio system is kind of an old boys' system and it's difficult for them to trust women to be capable,\" she said at the time. But Campion also suggested that there were reasons linked more closely to gender, saying: \"I think women don't grow up with the harsh world of criticism that men grow up with \u2013 we are more sensitively treated \u2013 and when you first experience the world of film-making you have to develop a very tough skin.\" For fellow New Zealand-born director Regan Hall his own gender has not hindered his approach to his first feature, Fast Girls, a female-centred story about British relay athletes to be released next month before the London olympics. \"I have never felt that I wasn't qualified,\" he said. \"I have done a lot of filming with women because I have worked in fashion and it never crossed my mind that a woman should be making this film.\" He added that historically women had developed expertise in other areas of film-making, such as editing, continuity and styling. \"There is something about being a director that means I can understand why more men do it,\" he said. \"There are different personality types involved. But I do think that the best way to encourage women is probably to look at a role model and in New Zealand we certainly have a good one with Jane Campion.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
