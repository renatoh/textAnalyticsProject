The consensus is that, were it possible to buy them from stadium box offices until shortly before kick-off, crowds would rise appreciably. It is an eminently sensible viewpoint, although some say such a late free-for-all could potentially jeopardise the stringent stadium security precautions which are in place across tournament venues. Such logic is hard to fathom though; surely if spectators are body-scanned and searched before taking their seats it doesn\u2019t matter where, or when, they purchased their ticket? Fifa moves in mysterious ways \u2013 invariably for commercial gain \u2013 but there is a bigger picture at stake. Record television audiences are wonderful but those armchair viewers like to see full grounds. Given that many schools, worldwide, have yet to break up and France is expensive \u2013 well, at least for us Brits \u2013 the doors should be opened to walk-up sales from locals. Louise Taylor France manager has good line in sarcasm France\u2019s manager, Corinne Diacre, grinned broadly when questioned on a change to the starting XI, having told the press she was sticking with the side that beat South Korea: \u201cWell you shouldn\u2019t believe everything I say \u2013 that\u2019s it.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time Diacre has toyed with the press. After France\u2019s opening win, her answer to a question over whether her stony air implied that her role model is the men\u2019s team manager, Didier Deschamps, rightfully dripped with sarcasm: \u201cOften I\u2019m told I\u2019m very strict. We never laugh around, we never joke, everything is very calculated \u2013 there\u2019s no exceptions. The girls are very unhappy and you can see that on the field. It\u2019s very difficult for the girls, not for me, but for them it\u2019s very difficult, as you can see.\u201d It has been refreshing to have, frankly, stupid questions replied to with the cutting and sassy disrespect shown by Diacre and it seems there will be more. \u201cIt\u2019s another characteristic of my personality,\u201d she quipped. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re not familiar with that. I can be quite ironic \u2013 you\u2019ll discover that.\u201d Suzanne Wrack Minnows dare to shine on debut Playing in your first World Cup must be nerve-wracking but all four nations making their World Cup bow have conducted themselves with aplomb. Although none of Chile, Jamaica, Scotland or South Africa have a point, all four showed glimpses of what they\u2019re capable of. Scotland rallied late, Chile succumbed at the death, Jamaica just couldn\u2019t live with Cristiane, and South Africa came closest against Spain and lost narrowly to China. They were on top against La Roja, who needed two VAR-awarded penalties to lead against opponents who had been reduced to 10, before firing home a third. No one expects much of first-timers on the biggest stage, but all four have shown why they deserve to be in France and this serves as a call to other nations vying for their first appearance. If you\u2019re good enough, you can qualify and once you\u2019re at a World Cup, anything could happen. As clich\u00e9d as \u201cDare to Shine\u201d is, it\u2019s exactly what those smaller nations are doing. Sophie Lawson Netherlands fans set the standard Some parts of France may have not been entirely enveloped in World Cup mania just yet, but one of the brightest standouts, literally, has been the Netherlands fans. In Eindhoven for the pre-tournament send-off friendly shops and streets were awash with orange. Posters, pennants, cutouts of stars such as Shanice van de Sanden and Lieke Martens adorned entrances. There were even bespoke foosball tables with individualised female players from the Dutch national side. More than 30,000 fans packed PSV\u2019s stadium against Australia and a large cohort of that orange tide swept into Le Havre for the Netherlands\u2019 opening fixture against New Zealand. The pocket horns might trigger vuvuzela-related traumas but the intense rhythmic clapping and chanting, fired on by a terrific travelling brass band playing such Dutch anthems as Auld Lang Syne and Go West, is a wonderful sound. The standard has well and truly been set \u2013 now for other nations to respond and keep the carnival atmospheres inside stadiums building. Richard Parkin USA put rest of contenders on notice With an eye-popping 13-0 win over Thailand, the USA squad seems to have embraced being the team that everyone wants to watch lose. Neutrals may not have enjoyed how the team celebrated their goals, even after the scoreline started to get out of hand, but the Americans seem to relish being dominant. Megan Rapinoe called it an \u201cexplosion of joy\u201d and joked about how thrilled she was the USA took the record for biggest winning margin in a World Cup from Germany, who in 2007 beat Argentina 11-0. There were concerns about the American squad coming into this tournament, specifically around its defence, and the thumping of Thailand doesn\u2019t change any of that. But the Americans have still put the field on notice. France were initially the team to beat, but now it looks as if the USA have assumed that role.
