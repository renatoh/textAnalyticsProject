Those cold-hearted racer snakes lying in wait for young marine iguanas on Sir David Attenborough\u2019s wonderful new BBC natural history series also happened to be an ideal allegory for the treacherous landscape of professional sport. To elude crushing disappointment requires determination and, above all, resourcefulness when it matters. In many ways that is Eddie Jones\u2019s key attribute; it takes more than a pack of biro-wielding snakes to deter the wily, fast-talking lizard of Oz. Only last year the England squad was swallowed up and spat out of its own World Cup; since Jones took over they have not lost in nine games and shed their old skin of tactical uncertainty. Should South Africa win at Twickenham on Saturday, extending their 12-game unbeaten run in this fixture, it will be a surprise to anyone who has been in and around the England camp in Bagshot this week. That in itself is a significant shift: the players seem happier and more energised, perhaps as ready for an opening game of an autumn series as they have ever been. As well as their pay rising to around \u00a322,000 per man per match excluding bonuses, the latest deal between the Rugby Football Union and the clubs has permitted the three training camps in Teddington, Brighton and Portugal. Preparation has been intense. RFU insiders say it is not uncommon for some of Jones\u2019s emails to be sent at 3.30am. The England captain, Dylan Hartley, says training is tougher than the actual matches: \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the boss and what he demands of us and that filters down. He\u2019s expectant and I think we all are now.\u201d Given England will kick off with seven of the same starting pack \u2013 the exception is Mako Vunipola for Joe Marler at loosehead prop \u2013 that Stuart Lancaster assembled two years ago, it has not simply been a matter of reshuffling personnel. The biggest difference, reckons the former All Black captain Sean Fitzpatrick, is between the ears: \u201cI think Eddie Jones is a very good coach and he\u2019s shown that,\u201d said Fitzpatrick, now a board member at Harlequins, who face NZ Maori at the Stoop on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s got the best out of a group of players that hadn\u2019t performed. It\u2019s about their mental attitude. The goal now is whether they can go to the next level and be No1 in the world in three years\u2019 time.\u201d That is indeed the six million dollar question \u2013 or whatever sum that is worth in sterling nowadays. Jones is allergic to complacency \u2013 \u201cIf we lose against South Africa the only thing they\u2019ll be asking me is: \u2018What time does your flight leave?\u2019\u201d \u2013 but the central struts of his grand design are increasingly clear. From the outset he has urged English players to reconnect with their powerful forward heritage and recalibrate what previously constituted absolute dedication. He also wants them to be leaner, meaner and more up-front. His one-to-one meetings with the squad in the Algarve, conducted on a public terrace, resembled a speed-dating convention: a couple of minutes of \u201chave you done what I told you last time, mate?\u201d before the next victim was ushered in. He likes a character, correctly judging that they enhance the collective mood, but making every player a little bit better is his obsession. Hence the judo and the recent arrival of no-nonsense Australian operatives such as Jason Ryles, Melbourne Storm\u2019s defence coach, and the squad\u2019s new conditioning guru, Dean Benton, previously with the Wallabies. Hartley says Jones is constantly on at him \u201cto make small, incremental changes\u201d that will extend his top-level career. That may be as simple as doing more stretching exercises or cutting a fraction or two off the time it takes to rise from the floor and get back in the defensive or attacking line \u2013 one of Jones\u2019s key selection criteria. There have already been judicious carrots dangled in front of resurgent senior players \u2013 Hartley, James Haskell, Chris Robshaw, now Tom Wood \u2013 with younger colleagues reminded there is no such thing as the finished article. As Jones observed this week: \u201cA lot of young players are like shooting comets. After a while they have a bit of a fall because you can\u2019t keep going like that. Then it\u2019s about how quickly you rebound.\u201d Jones\u2019s other conspicuous talent is his razor-sharp eye for rugby\u2019s latest trends. \u201cTalk about openside flankers is irrelevant in the modern game,\u201d he announced on Thursday. \u201cSomeone once asked [the former Springbok coach] Jake White if he\u2019d pick an openside and he said the only thing a fetcher is good for is getting the beers. You need players from 1-15 to contest the ball and make good decisions.\u201d Playing nine-man rugby on a wet day \u2013 and rain is forecast for Twickenham \u2013 is equally outdated against good sides. \u201cYou have to be able to move with where the game\u2019s going. You can\u2019t play just strangulation rugby any more and win high-level Test matches. Every law that comes in now is about making the game more dynamic: faster, more skilled. You shouldn\u2019t have to have numbers on their backs. I think 11, 14 and 15 will change their roles considerably going forward. It\u2019s the same with 6, 7 and 8.\u201d As so often he is spot on, just as he put a precise finger on South Africa\u2019s needs when he was employed as a consultant to work alongside White and the current South African head coach, Allister Coetzee, before the Boks\u2019s 2007 World Cup success. He and Coetzee got on well \u2013 there was much hilarity whenever the latter was asked to translate White\u2019s impassioned team-talks \u2013 and the results were impressive. \u201cI just tried to add finesse to what they did,\u201d shrugs Jones. \u201cWhen I went there the house was already painted. I was just filling in spots for them.\u201d The England house does not look too shabby either, unless the absence of the injured Maro Itoje, George Kruis, Haskell, Anthony Watson, Jack Nowell and co means the hosts start sluggishly against a colossal Bok pack. Jones is unfazed \u2013 \u201cSaying it\u2019s going to be physical is like saying that table is brown\u201d \u2013 and motivation is not an issue. \u201cWe are a team that have got a goal under Eddie to be the best in the world,\u201d said Hartley, sick and tired of never having beaten the Boks. \u201cThe Irish wrote their own history last week, the Chicago Cubs wrote their own history, now we want to do the same.\u201d Keep climbing up Jones\u2019s ladder and those nightmarish World Cup racer snakes will fade further from the memory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
