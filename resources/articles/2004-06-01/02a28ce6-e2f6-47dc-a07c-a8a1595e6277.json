When you wait ages for something, it's usually a bit of an anti-climax. Like Millennium Eve at Chasers, for instance. Or the second Stone Roses album. So let's hope Euro 2004 lives up to expectations when it all kicks off tomorrow [insert your own England hooligan gag here]. To the Fiver's eyes, the tournament has more possible winners than those tedious car insurance ads on loop - but our money was on Portugal, who get the ball rolling against Greece tomorrow, until we saw Luis Figo eye Brazilian-born rotund rascal Deco ... ... and sweet-spot him straight in the swingers! \"It's something that distorts team spirit and I don't agree with it,\" he said of Deco's decision to take Portugese nationality. \"If you're born Chinese, well, you have to play for China,\" he thundered, as Andy Townsend and Robbie Earle nervously eyed the nearest ceiling. Meanwhile back on Planet Burberry, everybody is getting ready for Sunday's ding-dong with France - and the captain David Beckham has been oozing insight as ever. \"We want to win,\" Becks announced during his latest rocket-science sermon. \"We definitely don't want to lose, but we're not looking for a draw.\" Of course Sven-Goran Eriksson wasn't any more insightful, but after a conference containing more Terrys than a chocolate orange factory, he admitted what we all knew: John Terry is out of Sunday's clash against France. Which means we have even more reason to worry about another Terry: Henry, who will be lining up against either Ledley King or Jamie Carragher. Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"It's not true. [Alan] Shearer has never been in our dreams and I didn't even know of his existence. I take the responsibility for this matter. The responsibility is mine. Some people call me a joker and, as a joker, I joked\" - Genoa president and stand-up comedian Enrico Preziosi ends the Alan-Shearer-to-Genoa speculation. * * * * * * * * * * * * HEINZ MEANZ ETC. Argentina defender Gabriel Heinze was full of beans today, which is more than can be said for The Fiver. With our only half-baked bean gag already in the can and another two-and-a-half paragraphs worth of space to fill, we're at a loss to know how best to pad out the news that the 26-year-old hard man has signed a five-year deal with Manchester United after a season spent turning heads (then ripping them from their shoulders and impaling them on spikes) at Paris St Germain. But if there's a better way of meandering towards the end of this story as quickly as possible than through liberal use of the trusty cut-and-paste tools, we're jiggered if we can think of it. \"I have a lot of things going through my mind,\" chirruped Heinze, already showing decidedly more mental agility than Rio Ferdinand, the ban-serving amnesiac he's been brought in to cover for at a cost of \u00a36m. \"I have loads of emotion about leaving PSG. I owe them a lot. The club and supporters will have an important place in my heart for what they have done for me the last three years. I will never forget them. But my dream is coming true by joining Manchester United. I am going to keep to keep working hard on the other side of the Channel.\" And while formula dictates that this should be the paragraph where Sir Alex Ferguson waffles on about how pleased he is to have got his man, what appears to be complete indifference on his part means we'll have to look elsewhere for quotes. Over to you again, Gabrielle: \"They have shown great motivation to snatch my services even though I did not talk directly with Sir Alex Ferguson,\" he told an empty press room. \"I don't know whether I'll play in central defence or at left-back, but signing for Manchester United does not secure a first-team status with the Argentina national team.\" Indeed it doesn't, as every United player in history apart from that bald waster they flogged to Chelsea last summer has proven so emphatically. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Auxerre's pretty-boy sweeper Phillipe Mexes has snubbed Sir Alex and is going to Roma instead. Monaco's pint-sized poacher Ludovic Giuly is on the brink of a move to Barcelona. Kanu will shilly-shally at the Valley next season after agreeing to join Charlton. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Jesper Gronkjaer may miss all of Euro 2004 after his mother died of cancer. Edwin van der Sar is a doubt for Holland's first match against Germany after injuring his finger in training. Everton are \"anxious\" to open talks with Wayne Rooney on a new contract, before he realises just how mid-table and mediocre they really are. And the Leeds revival starts here: Kevin Blackwell has signed, erm, Julian Joachim and is close to a deal for Paul Butler. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO BBC1: BBC Three On BBC One: Gazza (11.30pm) Alas, most of the Daft Beliefs we asked for yesterday are too sexist to print.
