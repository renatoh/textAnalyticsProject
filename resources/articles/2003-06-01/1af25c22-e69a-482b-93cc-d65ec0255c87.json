The panel that cleared the New Zealand lock Ali Williams of deliberately stamping on England's Josh Lewsey has responded to Rugby Football Union calls to explain its decision that contact between Williams' boot and Lewsey's head had been \"inadvertent\". It had accepted Williams' not guilty plea, said the panel, after concluding his foot had probably been deflected on to Lewsey's head via the forearm of an England player in the ruck. It also heard evidence that Williams had moved forward of Lewsey when the incident occurred, indicating that he had upheld his \"duty to take care for the safety of a player on the ground when there is a likelihood of contact with a player's boot while rucking\". The conclusion was that \"the contact with the head . . . was inadvertent and incidental to Williams' endeavour to ruck the football in a situation where access to it was impeded by the position of English players in the ruck.\" London Irish have signed the centre Nick Greenstock from Harlequins, who have taken Samoa's wing George Harder from Leeds. Rotherham have recruited the former Swansea and Bridgend prop Christian Loader. Sale's former back-row Apollo Perelini has joined the Sharks' coaching staff.
