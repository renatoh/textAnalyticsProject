The former England captain walks away without a stain on his reputation. If only life were that simple. Still, amid the acrimony, and as he lives with the prospect that black players in the dressing rooms of the premier league may not have been convinced by the explanation for his use of racially offensive language, he can at least take solace at home. His palace on the Queen's estate, just down the road from the Chelsea training ground, is coming on apace. It has 11 bedrooms, four bathrooms and now it seems battlements are being built on the first floor to repel all invaders. And the word is that the land he bought from the old folk next door will be used to make him a fishing lake. He can be as potty mouthed as he likes out there and no one can say a thing. \u2022 Easy to feel sorry for the royal parks as officials and the organisers of the summer concerts are battered from pillar to post. On the one hand, people are miffed about the state of the parks following the series of mud-caked events. On the other, there is criticism from the party set who objected to the curtailment of Bruce Springsteen's concert by the clock-watching jobsworth who pulled the plug on his microphone, spawning the headline, Bruce Springsteen: Born to overrun. But it would be much easier to feel sorry for them all were it not for the experience of MP Karen Buck, the Labour member for Westminster North. She was offered free tickets to the event, and being a virtuous type declined. But she suggested that the freebie could be used as a prize for young people she has been helping with their job skills. All are at risk of becoming Neets \u2013 marginalised by not being in employment, education or training. No chance, said the organisers. \"Senior management were keen to express that the tickets would be for invited attendees only.\" Only top people need apply. So shed those tears elsewhere. \u2022 From the Commons, we learn that Speaker John Bercow's campaign to make the workings of Westminster more intelligible to the public at large has some way to go. A question to the home secretary from Tory pointy-head Dominic Raab. \"On what basis,\" he asks, were \"the decisions (a) SCH/Com-ex (98) 26 def, (b) SCH/Com-ex (98) 8 rev.2, (c) SCH/Com-ex (99) 6\" included in her letter of 21 December 2011 to the chair of the European scrutiny committee and how do they relate to the UK? That's just a flavour of his question. The rest was no better. And what's worse, Home Office minister James Brokenshire knew what he was talking about. It's their own Esperanto. Be grateful. They speak it so you don't have to. \u2022 What to make of the escalating rupture between Madonna and the French far righter Marine Le Pen? The star ignored warnings from the far right leaderene and displayed swastika signs linking the Front National leader to nazism. The Front says it will sue. It probably won't. But if Le Pen carries out her threat, it will be a case to savour. Informed a few weeks back about Madonna's insult, Le Pen said: \"Has she given back the kids she stole in Africa yet \u2013 or did she end up buying them?\" Nasty. Could get worse. Don't look away. \u2022 Finally, the best of times. In technology, in medicine, everything has advanced. In the final edition of the magazine the Word, Martin Amis continues to reflect on human progress. \"The main thing I've learnt in my life, but I knew it all along, was that smoking and drinking is great,\" says Martin. \"I told my doctor the other day that I thought I had tendonitis in my left elbow. She said: 'Why do you think that is?' I said: 'Repetitive stress injury from opening bottles of wine.' That's why when I go into a liquor store in New York, and they go, 'Sir, what kind of wine could we interest you in?' I go, 'Screw top.' Screw top's improved the quality of my life by about 15%!\" Which proves that things are getting better. For two years ago, in his novel The Pregnant Widow, Amis wrote: \"Screw-top wine has improved the quality of life by about 10%, wouldn't you say?\" Up 5% in just two years. Happy days.
