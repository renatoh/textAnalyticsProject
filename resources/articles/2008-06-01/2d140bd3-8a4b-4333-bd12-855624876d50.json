Dvor\u00e1k and Stravinsky were the composers involved, and we were effectively asked to listen to them both at their most extravagant and most reined in. In Stravinsky's case, Dumbarton Oaks, for 14 players, was balanced by the kaleidoscopic panoplies of Firebird. Dvor\u00e1k was represented by three of his most exquisite miniatures and by an epic performance of the Cello Concerto. \"Epic\" is not a term we usually associate with this concerto, for which grace, charm and a relaxed tameness have become the norms in performance. But Dvor\u00e1k was an international star at the time of composition, and Fischer and his soloist, Pieter Wispelwey, brought out the grandeur in this music, without losing sight of its poetry. The great melody that forms the second subject of the first movement was noble and nostalgic, while the finale blended arrogance with excitement. Wispelwey thinks in terms of span as well as detail, and the dividends were enormous. With Fischer at his most incisive, the orchestral sound was turbulent and beguiling - in short, a terrific interpretation that changed the way we think about the piece itself. The rest of the concert, though less overtly radical, was equally insightful. The Dvor\u00e1k miniatures included the exquisite Nocturne in B and reminded us that great music need be neither demonstrative nor grandiose. Dumbarton Oaks, clean, clear and exuberantly precise, came over as more neo-baroque than neo-classical. Firebird, thrilling in its gaudy sensuality and orchestral richness, had the audience on the edge of their seats. Outstanding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
