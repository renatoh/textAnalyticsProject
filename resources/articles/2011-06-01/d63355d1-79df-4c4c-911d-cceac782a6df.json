The business secretary declared war on \"corporate short-termism\" in September 2010 as he began a major consultation on a range of issues such as takeovers and executive pay that he believes pose \"an increasing problem for our economy\". At the ABI's biennial conference in south London, Cable will give an update on the consultation \u2013 which ended in March, although the final response has yet to be published \u2013 setting out his latest thoughts on the problems posed by short-termism and how best to combat them. Cable launched the review following Kraft's takeover of Cadbury, a deal cited as an example of a company failing to take into account the interests of wider stakeholders. \"Short-term investors and financial gamblers value a quick buck above all else, for example, by driving company boards into accepting takeover bids that make no economic sense. We need shareholders that act like long-term owners, alive to the risks of instability and the broader consequences of how the companies they own behave,\" Cable said at the time. He has consulted with a range of stakeholders, including Tomorrow's Company, a thinktank dedicated to improving corporate stewardship \u2013 essentially handing something to the next generation in better shape than you inherited it. The thinktank will on Tuesday call for a system which gives the general population, which owns many companies through pension and insurance payments, a say in how businesses are run. \"However much the ultimate shareholders of Cadbury disliked their pension fund selling its Cadbury shares to American giant Kraft, they had no real means of making their views known,\" said Mark Goyder, founder of Tomorrow's Company. Goyder wants to help develop a system that encourages pension funds to take a broader and longer-term view of its investments and that makes it easier for employees to identify those funds. \"All too often pension funds are concerned with a narrow measurement of investment performance, over three, six to nine months. But they should be adopting a broader measure that includes issues such as climate change and carbon disclosure, since we need to provide for healthy business conditions in the longer term,\" Goyder said. \"All of us whose money is going into the system need to be given the opportunity to exercise some simple choices about stewardship. A consumer who walks down the supermarket aisle can choose to buy Fair Trade coffee, and they know what that means. The same should happen when we look at products offered us by fund managers: we should be able to tell the stewardship content,\" Goyder added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
