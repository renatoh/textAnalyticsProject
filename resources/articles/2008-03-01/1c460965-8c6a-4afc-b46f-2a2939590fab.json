That seems to be the implication of the experiences of some MacBook owners, who have set up the MacBook casing defects Flickr pool, currently boasting, er, 35 members. But Brian Ford on Newsvine noted the same problems, as has John Gruber (well, for his wife) and \"a ton of readers\". Oh, and include my wife in that. Lower-right hand corner as well. The problem seems to affect both white (cheaper) and black (pricier) MacBooks. Cause? Unknown. But it's longstanding - this Apple discussion (since closed for comments) goes back to 2006.

Or the (alleged, for Bill Bumgarner of Apple insists there weren't) cracks in the Cube? The media noise on this one is getting louder. What lies under the right-hand corner of the MacBook?

Update: I've emailed Apple to ask the following questions: what structure is below the lower right-hand side of the MacBook casing (hard drive, power converter, etc)? is Apple aware of MacBook case cracking as a product issue? is Apple taking any action in its manufacturing to reduce the incidence of this cracking? does Apple have any idea why this cracking might occur? is there any manufacturing process reason why this cracking might occur (eg finish line of a mould, etc)? I've asked for a response within the next 48 hours. Let's see.."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
