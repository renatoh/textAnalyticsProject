The new Southampton manager, Ronald Koeman, does not want the centre-half to depart and said he will go only for a healthy price. Liverpool\u2019s offer is believed to be around \u00a316m. Koeman has also viewed Aston Villa\u2019s Ron Vlaar as a direct replacement after the Aston Villa player impressed during Holland\u2019s run to the World Cup semi-finals. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose him but, if he leaves he will only go for a top price,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cRon would definitely be an option but I think he won\u2019t be cheap right now. We just have to wait and see how it develops.\u201d The France striker Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my is due to fly to Boston on Monday, where Liverpool are currently on a pre-season tour, to undergo a medical before his proposed \u00a38m move from QPR, while Divock Origi has told Lille he, too, wants to move to Anfield and could also travel to Boston for a medical this week. The 18-year-old impressed for Belgium at the World Cup, scoring a late winning goal against Russia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
