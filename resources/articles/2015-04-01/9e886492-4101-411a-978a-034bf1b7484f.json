Throw in the teams being co-tenants and the match being staged in the afternoon of a four-day holiday weekend and the match looks set to be a blockbuster that could bring in up to 60,000 fans \u2013 an absolute boon for NRL HQ, who has been stinging from a big drop in crowds this year. Those who rock up should witness a cracking match between two teams who could well meet again on the first Sunday in October. Both have started the season in fine style. Having swept all before them over the offseason \u2013 winning the Auckland Nines and the World Club Challenge \u2013 Souths opened the year with three straight victories before a disappointing loss to Parramatta. Canterbury overcame a shocking first 65 minutes against Penrith in round one to win three on the trot including a golden point triumph against the Tigers they had no right to win after losing Brett Morris and Tim Lafai in the lead-up to the game. It was a win carved out of courage and commitment. History suggests Canterbury are very much a chance in this one with the losing grand finalist winning seven of the last 12 grand final rematches. And this time there will be no Sam Burgess for Souths, Dylan Walker is sidelined with a broken thumb, Kirisome Auva\u2019a is serving a lengthy suspension and John Sutton is laid up with injury. The Bunnies are a team full of stars but with just eight players who played in last year\u2019s decider set to turn out for Souths they are vulnerable. Canterbury have just four changes from last year\u2019s decider \u2013 and all are upgrades. This is a clash of the titans \u2013 and it is the underdog who is in the box seat. Manly on the ropes The Sea Eagles are on the verge of losing three straight \u2013 and a defeat at the hands of Canberra has Manly coach Geoff Toovey well and truly in the gun. The Sea Eagles are in the throes of an injury crisis with Jamie Lyon, Feleti Mateo and Josh Starling all ruled out of a trip to Albury while Steve Matai is in significant doubt. Manly\u2019s pack was beaten to a pulp against the Dragons, allowing an average of 9.5 metres a hit up, an astonishing figure that highlights just how far the Sea Eagles forwards have fallen. If the Raiders\u2019 sizeable and aggressive forwards control Manly in the same way, Ricky Stuart\u2019s team will be collecting the two points while the pressure on Toovey could become overwhelming for a club that has reportedly already sounded out Trent Barrett about taking over in 2016. Sims returns The news from the Hunter is all good. After opening the season with four straight wins for the first time since Andrew Johns\u2019 heyday, the Knights will turn out boom forward Tariq Sims for the first time since his move from North Queensland. One of the most dangerous forwards in the game, Sims will be champing at the bit for a big debut for his new club. He will fire like a rocket against the Dragons. And if he can give Newcastle some high energy impact, Rick Stone might have a very real title contender on his hands. Bird in the hand Cronulla fans have had little to hold onto this year after an 0-4 start following their wooden spoon disaster in 2014. The Sharks have had it all. They have been mercilessly whipped, endured heartbreaking defeat, gone down as both favourites and outsiders, at home and on the road. A month down and their season is all but over, winless and withering in last spot. It is all eyes on the future at Shark Park and the faithful will be hoping that the future is highly promising recruit Jack Bird. The former Dragons junior debuted last week off the bench and was outstanding. He starts at five-eighth against the Roosters and if one club deserves something positive it is the poor old Sharkies. Blues full-back battle heats up The season has only just started but it seems like State of Origin is just around the corner and there have been few more compelling positional battles than the chase for the Blues No1. No fewer than five contenders will play this weekend. All have set the competition alight over the opening four rounds and would not look out of place in the Blue line-up. For what it is worth, James Tedesco should be considered to have his nose in front of Josh Dugan and Matt Moylan with Brett Stewart and Will Hopoate still well in the mix."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
