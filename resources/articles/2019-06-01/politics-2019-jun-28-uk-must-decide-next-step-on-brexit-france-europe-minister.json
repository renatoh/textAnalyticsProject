Asked to respond to a report that Boris Johnson, the Conservative leadership favourite, had called the French \u201cturds\u201d over Brexit, De Montchalin declined to comment, saying she was unfamiliar with the word. The minister said Brexit was \u201ca British issue for the British to decide\u201d. She told the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris: \u201cIf the UK wants to leave the EU, and in an orderly way, the withdrawal agreement is the deal on the table, which has been negotiated for over two years. We\u2019ve also said that the political declaration on the future relationship is open to discussion if the prime minister had a majority.\u201d De Montchalin said the key question was to move on as quickly as possible to think about the future relationship. \u201cWhat is important is how we work together on the future on issues that are economic, academic, cultural, social, defence and security \u2013 what we\u2019ll do together, and we\u2019ll do a lot together, that\u2019s certain.\u201d She said the EU 27 countries were united on Brexit. Asked if France would back giving another extension to Britain\u2019s leaving date beyond 31 October, De Montchalin said there would have to be a political element \u201cwhich showed that, if more time is given, something will be happening\u201d. She said for the last extension, which was given in the spring, this was after cross-party talks between Conservatives and Labour. For any future request, there would have to be a process in place. \u201cIf it\u2019s just the question \u2018we\u2019d like more time\u2019, the EU council is very clear on that: there\u2019s no reason for it without a new political scheme being put forward.\u201d She said the advantage of the withdrawal agreement was that it included a transition period \u201cwhich allows us to discuss the future in a stabilised situation. If there was not an exit agreement, we\u2019d be discussing the future in a situation that wasn\u2019t stabilised.\u201d She said many EU countries had made contingency preparations for a no-deal exit \u201cnot because they want that\u201d but because there might be a possibility it could happen by accident. \u201cThe cost of uncertainty is high \u2013 in the economy in general, in industry, in the financial sector, among fishermen on both sides of channel who don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there are a certain number of governments, who see the cost of that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
