So why are ads for sex toys still taboo?", "bodyText": "Given society\u2019s obsession with women\u2019s sexual organs \u2013 how they should look, how they should smell \u2013 it is ironic that they are so intentionally concealed. The latest attempt to obscure any mention of women\u2019s nether regions comes from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the company that runs the New York subway, which has rejected adverts by women\u2019s sexual health startup Dame Products showing sex toys. Dame is now suing the MTA over its decision. Although the MTA maintains that the promotion of \u201csexually oriented business\u201d has long been prohibited, the definition appears to be slippery (much to its disgust, no doubt). Several sexually suggestive, tongue-in-cheek-and-God-knows-where-else ads have been allowed, including ones for condoms and erectile dysfunction medication. Dame\u2019s adverts don\u2019t depict bodies or faces contorted in ecstasy of orgasm, and the products in question aren\u2019t explicit: they are smooth, brightly coloured objects that could be mistaken for a millennial mood-tracking device, or some newfangled step-counter. The company says it spent $150,000 (\u00a3119,000) on revising the campaign so that it was more appropriate, and collaborated with the MTA; it was even told there were \u201cno objections\u201d to the proposed ads. Meanwhile, Hims, a company that sells medication for erectile dysfunction, was allowed a flagrant campaign featuring phallic-shaped cacti and taglines such as \u201chard made easy\u201d that barely bothered with innuendo. This inconsistency isn\u2019t surprising when male sexuality is considered a type of public health issue (how many more studies do we need into the average penis size?), while the very existence of female sexuality is still taboo. The MTA maintains that this isn\u2019t a sexism issue, pointing out that adverts for another New York sex-toy company, Unbound, were initially rejected last year for displaying \u201cphallic symbols\u201d. (Unlike Dames, Unbound refused to remove the imagery that had been deemed inappropriate.) In 2015, period underwear company Thinx was told by the MTA that its adverts \u2013 showing a grapefruit cut in half to sort of look like a fanny, and runny egg whites \u2013 were disallowed. So Dame is not the first product referencing women\u2019s genitals to have been suppressed, and it won\u2019t be the last. Earlier this year, female sex-toy company Lora DiCarlo was given an innovation award at the Consumer Electronics Show that was later revoked, with organisers saying they considered the Os\u00e9 massager \u201cimmoral, obscene, indecent, [and/or] profane\u201d. (After an outcry, the award was restored.) It took until 2017 for Britain to depict a sanitary towel with blood on it, as opposed to the blue liquid resembling detergent. This is not just an issue with female desire, but with our anatomy full stop. The attempts to censor women\u2019s bodies with double entendres or to exclude them completely makes it clear how afraid of them we are."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
