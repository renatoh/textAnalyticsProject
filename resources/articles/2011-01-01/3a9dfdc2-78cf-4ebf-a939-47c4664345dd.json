But he may have overtaken his Hampshire opening partner Michael Carberry, another left-hander, who was forced to withdraw from the winter tours because of blood clots and breathing difficulties that prevented him from flying. Ravi Bopara, Essex Age 25 Tests 10 Ten Tests and 51 one-day internationals to his name, the 25-year-old all-rounder will be desperate to force his way back into the England set-up. He has worked hard on his game since being dropped from the last Test of the 2009 Ashes series after a string of failures at No3, and although that place has now been tied down for the long term by Jonathan Trott, Bopara has a useful second string to his bow with lively medium pace.. After rebuilding his confidence in New Zealand domestic cricket last winter, he's spent some time with the KwaZulu Dolphins in Durban and will now join the England Lions tour of West Indies Andrew Gale, Yorkshire Age 27 Tests 0 Another of the young guns who made Yorkshire's surprisingly successful 2010 campaign such a positive story for English cricket, this left-hander is the sort of character who would be welcomed into the Test squad. He was a surprise appointment as Yorkshire captain, but comes across as a natural leader, and relishes the extra responsibility, as he showed with a superb unbeaten 151 in a crucial late-season Championship match against Nottinghamshire on a tricky Trent Bridge pitch. James Hildreth, Somerset Age 26 Tests 0 A 26-year-old from Milton Keynes who was sufficiently highly thought of even back in 2004-05 to earn a place at the Academy, but who seemed in danger of going down as a nearly man until a breakthrough season last year. A technically correct and aesthetically pleasing right-hander, he scored more than 2,500 runs in all forms of the game, playing a key role in Somerset's unexpectedly good summer, and offered further evidence of his ability to compile the long innings necessary in Test cricket with an unbeaten 206 when the players on the Performance Programme faced Queensland in November.. Has been appointed captain of the Lions for the forthcoming tour of West Indies. Adam Lyth, Yorkshire Age 23 Tests 0 Left-handed opener from Whitby who was the only man to score more Championship runs than Hildreth last summer, having been given an overdue chance at Yorkshire by the retirement of Michael Vaughan. Earned selection for both the Performance Programme and the Lions, and scored a century in that Queensland game. After exploiting Phillip Hughes's looseness at the top of Australia's order this winter, England will be keen for him to prove that he is more than a dashing one-season wonder. Some at Yorkshire expect him to drop down to Vaughan's old position at No3. James Taylor, Leicestershire Age 20 Tests 0 Five-foot-five son of a jockey who is the smallest player in county cricket, but could go on to achieve big things. Named young player of the year by his peers and the Cricket Writers' Association after passing 1,000 runs in 2009, he repeated the feat last summer. Still needs to prove himself in Division One cricket, but won't have done his cause any harm with a century in the Performance Programme's game against a Western Australia XI in Perth before Christmas.Will aim to build on that impact with the Lions in the Caribbean in the next two months. Also a brilliant fielder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
