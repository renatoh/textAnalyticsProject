He criticised the commission for failing to take action on children in detention under a Labor government, despite meeting Labor senators. Abbott shot down the report\u2019s recommendation of a royal commission, but said if one was held, \u201cit would condemn them [Labor]\u201d. Earlier Abbott called the report a \u201cblatantly partisan exercise\u201d and said the commission \u201cshould be ashamed of itself\u201d. Asked on Fairfax radio on Thursday morning if he felt any guilt over the findings, the prime minister said \u201cnone whatsoever\u201d. \u201cThe most compassionate thing you can do is stop the boats,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cWhere was the Human Rights Commission when hundreds of people were drowning at sea [under Labor]? \u201cThis is a blatantly partisan politicised exercise and the Human Rights Commission ought to be ashamed of itself. \u201cI reckon that the Human Rights Commission ought to send a note of congratulations to Scott Morrison to say \u2018well done, mate\u2019,\u201d Abbott said. The attorney general, George Brandis, tabled the Forgotten Children report on Wednesday night. It found that prolonged detention had significant negative impacts on the physical and emotional wellbeing of children. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot within this report that is either dated or questionable,\u201d immigration minister Peter Dutton told reporters on Thursday. \u201cIf there was a need for this report, it really should have been done under Labor\u2019s watch when tens of thousands of people came over our border.\u201d Dutton\u2019s predecessor Scott Morrison stopped short of calling the report politically motivated, but said the timing was questionable. \u201cThe Australian people aren\u2019t mugs, they can see through that,\u201d Morrison told ABC Radio. The 15-month span of the report takes in the last nine months of the Labor government and the first six months of the Coalition government. Dutton admitted the government had \u201csome fundamental differences of opinion with the Human Rights Commissioner [Gillian Triggs]. They are long-standing,\u201d Dutton said. Triggs defended the report against the prime minister\u2019s claims. \u201cI can assure you and the Australian public that this is not a politicised exercise,\u201d she said at a media conference in Sydney on Thursday. \u201cIt is a fair minded report and I ask all Australians to read the report and you will see that the evidence on which we rely is evidence that covers the period of the former government as well as the nearly 18 months of the current government. \u201cSo I totally reject any suggestion that this report is a politicised exercise. The facts frankly speak for themselves and this report speaks for itself.\u2019\u2019 Labor\u2019s immigration spokesman, Richard Marles, said implying the report was politically motivated was an \u201caspersion\u201d on Triggs. \u201cI completely reject the idea that the commissioner and her work has been political,\u201d he told ABC radio. \u201cThis is not a political document. I think this is raising or telling very disturbing stories to begin with but raising a number of proposals about how the system can work better in the future.\u201d Dutton said the system was already working better. \u201cThe conditions have improved. The conditions were at breaking point under Labor,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cWe\u2019ve put significant amounts of money into the way the centres are run.\u201d Marles said the report showed the \u201csystem can be improved [and] it needs to be improved\u201d. \u201cObviously things need to be done better so that kids can be taken out of this situation as quickly as is practicable,\u201d Marles said. But he reiterated Labor\u2019s support for offshore processing. The Greens want the government to adopt the report\u2019s 16 recommendations, including the release of all children in detention within four weeks, and the implementation of a royal commission. \u201cNo longer can we turn a blind eye to the sexual, physical and psychological abuse that these policies of indefinite detention are inflicting on children,\u201d Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about political parties or a particular government, this about us in the Parliament doing what\u2019s right for vulnerable children. MPs must exercise their conscience and bring an end to the indefinite incarceration of children.\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
