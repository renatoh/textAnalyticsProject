Bobby Fischer, king of chess before computers changed the rules, met his checkmate on Thursday after three decades of chess - and personal - infamy. The obituaries described his escape into the chess board as an effort to remain sane. Front-page articles implied that the game's simple rules and clear boundaries offered a safe and predictable space in which Fischer could operate. But as soon as this walled garden was threatened - by the media eager to watch this maestro play, by politicos placing preposterous diplomatic outcomes on the balance of his most famous win, by the onslaught of artificial intelligence programs hellbent on outwitting the champion - he checked out of the chess game and made for the hills of eccentricity. Since Fischer's noted win in 1972, things have changed. Videogames in particular are no longer refuges with simple rules; today's creators design products that encourage players actively to tear down boundaries and to bend the plethora of rules. New games that rely on social involvement and user-generated content are as dependent upon socially decreed codes of decency as they are on the efforts of the gamemakers. Game rules now have as many exceptions as the English language, designed to cope with the needs of a diverse and demanding audience. As player freedoms open up, the rules become more unwieldy and the nature of \"game\" is thrown into flux. Fischer's reported attempts to avoid these by losing himself in the black and white world of two moves forward and one move down means that he would be as likely to immerse himself in the rule miasma of such products as return to the country of his birth (or, indeed, as it would to welcome him with open arms). There are champions in the modern computer game world, but comparisons would be pointless. Celebrated first person shooter player Johnathan \"Fatal1ty\" Wendel is the soldier on the front line compared to the chess star's tactical general in the war room. The nature of contemporary videogame competition has left the careful consideration of the chess world behind; the fast-paced Quake3 makes better viewing for the post-MTV generation. Fischer showed what made him a great games player: adaptability, calm under pressure, the ability to juggle multiple problems while at the same time making moves towards the ultimate goal. But there are few such refuges in the contemporary gaming world; they increasingly seek to reflect the reality which they ultimately are escaping."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
