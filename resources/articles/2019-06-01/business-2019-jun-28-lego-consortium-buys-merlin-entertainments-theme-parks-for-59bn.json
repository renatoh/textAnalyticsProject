Merlin, which also counts Staffordshire theme park Alton Towers, waxworks Madame Tussauds and the London Eye among its attractions, had come under pressure from an activist investor to find a private buyer after struggling in recent months. The consortium taking over the company is 50% owned by Kirkbi, the private investment company of the family of Kirk Kristiansen, the inheritor of the Lego fortune who is said by Bloomberg to be worth $5.7bn (\u00a34.5bn). The other half is owned by private equity buyer Blackstone and CPPIB, the Canadian pension fund. The bid values Merlin\u2019s shares at \u00a34.8bn, plus a further \u00a31.1bn in debt. The 455p per share terms represent a 15% premium to the closing price of 395p on Thursday evening, although it is a 37% premium to the price before US investor ValueAct wrote a public letter urging the Merlin board to find a buyer. However, the offer price remains significantly lower than the company\u2019s value two years ago, when shares traded as high as 537p. Merlin shares rose nearly 14% on Friday after the takeover deal was announced, to 450p. Merlin operates more than 100 attractions, along with hotels and holiday villages, in 27 countries. In the UK, its business includes Chessington World of Adventures, Blackpool Tower and Dungeons attractions in London and other cities. Sir John Sunderland, chairman of Merlin\u2019s board, said multiple fatal terrorist attacks, particularly in Westminster, London Bridge and Manchester, had had long-lasting effects on people\u2019s willingness to visit city centre attractions. \u201cThe markets were in a different place at that time [in 2017] and it was prior to the series of terrible events in our capital city,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very attractive offer for our shareholders.\u201d Sunderland said he had turned down four inadequate offers for the business from the consortium. The first offer came in at 425p per share two days before ValueAct published its letter. The deal is not expected to affect the vast majority of the company\u2019s 28,000 employees, although some jobs relating to public company reporting requirements may be redundant, Sunderland said. The acquirers said they recognised the need for \u201csignificant long-term investment\u201d in Merlin\u2019s attractions. The deal would return Merlin to the ownership of Kirkbi and Blackstone six years after the investors floated the company on the London Stock Exchange for 315p per share. Kirkbi has owned a stake in Merlin since 2005 and holds 29.6% of shares. S\u00f8ren Thorup S\u00f8rensen, the Kirkbi chief executive, emphasised Lego\u2019s close relationship with Merlin\u2019s Legoland attractions. He said the investors were committed to \u201cLegoland and the other activities of Merlin\u201d. Merlin struggled as a public company. Share price performance since 2013 has been roughly equal to that of the broader FTSE 350 index. Alongside the terror attacks, Merlin also lost ground after a 2015 incident in which two rollercoasters collided on a ride at Alton Towers, leaving five passengers with life-changing injuries and reducing visitor numbers for months afterwards. People with knowledge of the deal\u2019s rationale said the investors believe Merlin needs longer-term support, without the pressure of reporting to shareholders each quarter, in order to make the large investments required in its assets as the trend for customers spending more on experiences rather than objects gains momentum. The acquisition would also represent a coup for ValueAct. In May, the San Francisco-based activist investor\u2019s chief investment officer, Mason Morfit, and partner Jake Welch, wrote: \u201cSimply put: Merlin has struggled as a public company. \u201cPrivate ownership is simply better placed than current public shareholders to underwrite the investments Merlin must make and to align employee incentives appropriately.\u201d ValueAct owns 9.3% of shares, while other major owners include US hedge fund Marathon Asset Management and the Wellcome Trust\u2019s investment arm. Sunderland said Merlin, which made profits of \u00a3230m from revenues of \u00a31.7bn in 2018, would not be significantly affected by political and macroeconomic uncertainty in the UK as the second scheduled Brexit date approaches. He said: \u201cClearly there is a degree of uncertainty about the future. In my experience people still want to enjoy themselves.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
