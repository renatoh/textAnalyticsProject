A layer of the well-rotted stuff from the base of the heap, spread on borders and the surface of pots, will tart up the garden no end. If what you find is disappointing, however, you may need a compost activator - young nettles or comfrey leaves are good for this, while urine (in small quantities) contains the perfect balance of enzymes to heat up the heap. Challenge the exhibitionist of the household to unzip and do their bit. Potatoes from Peru The potato family tree The Peruvian ancestors of the humble spud have never been grown here, because these equatorial residents refuse to form tubers in our changing day lengths. But careful selection has now led to the development of the maincrop 'Mayan Gold', the first UK-adapted Peruvian potato, which can be planted until early May. Its nutty flavour, unusual, creamy texture and golden flesh have already made it a hit with the restaurant trade; from Thompson &amp; Morgan, 01473 695225 (thompson-morgan.com). Plant of the week Zonal geraniums produce masses of showy blooms all summer long, and are fuss-free and drought-tolerant. Plant as centrepiece in a mixed basket, or in ranks of pots. 'Flower Fairy Berry' is a lovely, rich, berry purple, 'Blanca' pure white, and 'Salmon Princess' a delicate pink. Readers can order three plants (one of each) as 4cm plugs for \u00a36.95, nine plants (three of each) for \u00a313.90, or 18 plants (six of each) for \u00a322.70. Prices include UK p&amp;p.
