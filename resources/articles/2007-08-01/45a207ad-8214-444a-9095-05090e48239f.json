Inspired by the iconic Radio 4 programme, Houstoun considers what bits of our physical lives we might want to take with us if we were to be cast away on a desert island. Snatches of conversation, familiar gestures, an embrace, a way of walking; these are the dances of everyday life which rank as Houstoun's funny, poignant equivalent of our playlist of favourite tunes. \u00b7 Theatre Workshop, Sat 25 Meli Melo II: Chicos Mambos Edinburgh Anyone exhausted by the general seriousness of dance on the Fringe should find comic relief in Chicos Mambos. The quirks of dancers and the cliches of choreographers all come under scrutiny as Philippe Lafeuille, a French dancer based in Barcelona, takes a trawl through the highs and lows of the dance profession. Ballet, ballroom, modern and ice dance - none are spared in this charming hour-long show, which sounds like Spain's answer to British comic duo New Art Club. \u00b7 Assembly Universal Arts, Freemason's Hall, Sat 25 to Mon 27 Scottish Dance Theatre: Sorry For The Missiles! Edinburgh Vanessa Haska, joint winner of the 2007 Peter Darrell Choreographic Award, shows her dramatic mettle in this new piece for Scottish Dance Theatre. Featuring the whole company and set to a vibrant, emotional mix of eastern European folk music, Sorry For The Missiles! is about the emotional state of war and the lives of people who become unwittingly caught up in conflict. The material for this work was originally drawn from the ongoing hostilities in and around Gaza but, as a native Greek Cypriot, Haska has also drawn on the history of struggle, division and loss much closer to her family home. \u00b7 Zoo Southside, Sat 25 &amp; Sun 26 Peter Schaufuss: Satisfaction London Peter Schaufuss has an infallible eye for the spin of public relations. Having already choreographed works about Elvis and Princess Diana, he is now plugging into the continuing and apparently inexhaustible global phenomenon that is the Rolling Stones. Satisfaction is billed as a dance concert rather than a ballet, so it presumably features no biographical incidents with Mick and his many girls. Whether the same is true for Keith Richards' antics is another matter. But this show does go straight for the musical jugular with 25 dancers in a sequence of high energy numbers set to two dozen of the Stones' greatest hits, including Sympathy For The Devil, Ruby Tuesday and, of course, the titular Satisfaction. \u00b7 Apollo Theatre, W1, Tue 28 to Sep 8"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
