He had agreed to provide support and help to the current manager Alex McLeish, during his early days at Ibrox. The Dutchman took over the reins of his national side for the second time earlier this year in a job-share with the KNVB. However, the transition has been so good that Advocaat, who was set to leave at the end of this season, can now concentrate solely on helping the Dutch side qualify for Euro 2004. McLeish has already won the Scottish and CIS Insurance Cups and took Rangers to the top of the Scottish Premier League for the first time in 25 months last week. Advocaat enjoyed a close working relationship with the former Rangers chairman David Murray when he succeeded Walter Smith in 1998. The Dutchman helped build the multi-million pound Murray Park training facility and took the club to five trophies out of six in his first two seasons. Murray paid tribute to his legacy. \"Dick Advocaat's determination in creating training and youth development facilities has created a solid foundation for the future,\" he said. The club have no immediate plans to replace him as director of football. But, despite Advocaat's success on the domestic front in his first two seasons, the club's European ambitions foundered. Then in 2001 Martin O'Neill's Celtic won the domestic treble and Advocaat was left to lick his wounds. Last season, Celtic again had a substantial lead before the Dutchman stepped down in favour of McLeish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
