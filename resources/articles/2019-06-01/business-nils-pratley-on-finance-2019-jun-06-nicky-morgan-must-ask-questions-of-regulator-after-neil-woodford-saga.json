You can\u2019t expect to charge management fees at the old rate while the customers are not able to redeem their investments. On that score, Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee, is correct. Woodford Capital, the management company 65%-owned by Woodford, collected a \u00a336.5m dividend last year. He can afford to run the Equity Income Fund for free until customers are allowed to deal again. If he still has dreams of reviving his career, it may even pay him to do so. But Morgan, if she intends to dive deeper into this saga, needs to be clear on what her committee should investigate. Woodfood\u2019s hubristic stock-picking approach in the past two years does not seem worthy of much parliamentary time. Nor does the mere act of closing the funds temporarily; that\u2019s within the rules and is designed to protect investors from a fire sale of assets (the pace of Woodford\u2019s current selling looks scorching anyway). Better to concentrate on two other aspects. By way of reminder, one is the role of fund platforms as uncritical promoters of of \u201cstar\u201d fund managers. Hargreaves Lansdown is now waiving its own 0.45% fee on the Equity Income fund, which suggests it is better attuned to the mood of its clients or has a guilty conscience. Morgan &amp; co could usefully put Hargreaves on the spot and get it to explain how 0.45% is justified in the first place. The other area for attention is the soft-shoe shuffle whereby Woodford listed stakes in a few unlisted holdings on the previously obscure stock exchange in Guernsey, a manoeuvre seemingly designed to get around the 10% cap on unlisted holdings. The Financial Conduct Authority is exploring the Guernsey angle, but there are also questions for the regulator. Was it asleep, or was it merely powerless to act under EU rules? Neither interpretation is good \u2013 but we need to know which is correct. John Lewis gamble on White could pay off Sharon White was only ever a long-shot bet to be the next governor of the Bank of England, but punters could probably have named their price on her being chosen as chairman of the John Lewis Partnership. The outgoing chief executive of media regulator Ofcom has no retail background and her experience at the sharp end of the money-making game amounts to 18 months as a non-executive director at Barratt Developments, the housebuilder. \u201cI readily recognise that Sharon is not the conventional retail choice,\u201d the current chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, said. You bet. John Lewis is also making this appointment \u2013 a \u00a31m-a-year executive role, so not ceremonial \u2013 during stormy weather in retail-land. The employee-owned business has suffered a downwards lurch in profits and has slashed partners\u2019 bonuses. A risky hire, then? Well, yes, obviously. But do not call it illogical. When White was appointed to Ofcom five years ago, industry executives similarly muttered that she had no experience in regulation or media; they probably expected to run rings around her. Instead, half a decade later, Ofcom looks in stronger shape that it has been for years. White\u2019s primary battle was with BT over Openreach, the broadband division, and she achieved roughly what she wanted by threatening, but not ultimately demanding, a full breakup. BT has picked up the pace on fibre investment and we have been spared the unnecessary tedium of a fight in the courts. From a regulatory point of view, that\u2019s a decent outcome. Ofcom has 900 employees, whereas John Lewis has 84,000, so White will have to learn on the job. She can only be judged by results, but she could be a shrewd hire. Field makes use of Arcadia vote delay Frank Field MP got there in the end. The one-week delay in the vote on Arcadia\u2019s restructuring plan has created some time to look closely at the pension aspect of the plan, and Sir Philip Green\u2019s former tormentor intends to use it. He wants the Pensions Regulator to explain why it is happy with a structure that would see Lady Green contribute \u00a3100m over three years and Arcadia give the pension fund security more than \u00a3210m of assets. Those numbers are large, but so is the deficit \u2013 \u00a3750m or so on one accounting measure. Field, thankfully, seems to have grasped the essential point. Companies do not always survive after restructuring. If the Greens are to be pressed for more on pensions, it has to happen now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
