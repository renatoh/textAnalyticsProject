There are no 180\u00b0 turns, bomb blasts or thwarted attacks but there is just enough plot development to keep us going. Carrie, Quinn and Saul all have signature moments \u2013 a reminder that in Danes, Friend and Patinkin we have a formidable trio heading up the show. \u2018I don\u2019t need a babysitter\u2019 Peter Quinn\u2019s day begins badly with a horrifying nightmare compounded by a clumsy pass at Carrie. But things take a sharp upward turn when he visits Tommy, the coke dealer who ripped him off. Tommy is a big guy, but even the shadow of Quinn is too much Quinn for him. Our boy clobbers the oaf and steals his gun. Now he is armed and dangerous. He may need to be to confront whatever is going on in the apartment opposite Carrie\u2019s \u2013 if it\u2019s not the product of his fevered imagination. \u2018Mathison \u2013 I got to hand it to you. You are a dog with a fucking bone\u2019 Carrie is a born rule-breaker and as such, is perpetually in trouble. Her defiance of the court order to talk to Massoud/Tyrone prompts the prosecution to withdraw their plea bargain. Overnight, Reda and Carrie have gone from angling for three years to a trial where Sekou Bah faces 15 years in a federal supermax like the one currently housing the Boston Marathon bomber. Reda despairs of her and when she tells Sekou, he has to leave the room before he says or does something he will regret. In desperation, she reaches out to Roger, an old colleague from her time in Baghdad. They have helped each other out in the past, but the transcript of a call between Conlin and Massoud that she asks for could end his career in a heartbeat. It\u2019s a nonstarter, he tells her. Yet somehow he manages to go one better. Instead of the transcript, he provides an actual recording of the call in which Conlin tells Massoud to delete a taped conversation with Sekou. Carrie tells Conlin face-to-face that it constitutes fabricating evidence and obstructing justice. He begs to differ, but knows it is significant leverage. She wants all charges dropped against Sekou or she will play the recording to the Attorney General. Carrie turned a catastrophe into a win \u2013 and even she\u2019s not exactly sure how she did it. It is exactly that Midas touch that gets her private audiences with the President-elect. Having been assured by Dar Adal that Saul strongly endorses the Israeli\u2019s parallel program theory, Keane seeks her counsel. The word \u2018conclusive\u2019 is an immediate red flag for her. Intelligence officers steer away from such sturdy adjectives, she explains, citing George Tenet\u2019s infamous \u201cslam dunk\u201d as a cautionary tale. If Keane wants to know what Saul really thinks, she should read his report and not rely on Adal\u2019s creative pr\u00e9cis. As he surreptitiously listens in on their conversation, Adal is deeply offended at the suggestion that he could be so underhand. You think you know someone \u2026 \u201cAll we have to do was negotiate away a program we never wanted in the first place\u201d Saul wastes no time getting down to business in Abu Dhabi and Farhad Nafisi is swiftly caught in the Bear\u2019s honey trap. Saul interrogates him as Tovah and Mossad look on. Nafisi claims to be buying anti-aircraft devices from the Russians, something completely legal under the terms of the nuclear deal. He says he knows nothing of any deal with North Korea and sounds convincing enough. The money going into his secret bank account suggests otherwise though. Saul expresses those concerns in his report to Adal. Nafisi\u2019s parting shot \u2013 that the entire Iranian nuclear program was just a ruse to get sanctions lifted \u2013 niggles Saul, and it\u2019s not the only thing. An old empty packet of Nafisi\u2019s cigarettes in the trash makes him suspicious, though we are not entirely sure why. Saul\u2019s trip over the border to visit his Zionist sister on the West Bank seems at first like a sincere attempt to reconnect with a troublesome family member. That may well be part of it, but his clandestine trip in the dead of night suggests his family reunion is a convenient camouflage for him to resolve whatever bothered him about that cigarette packet. Notes and observations \u2022 There\u2019s a new set of titles for us featuring Elizabeth Keane, civil unrest and Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s The Revolution Will Not Be Televised. \u2022 \u201cHow can you live knowing that your very presence here makes peace less possible?\u201d Saul\u2019s argument with his sister gets into the divisions between American and Israeli Jews, something explored here. \u2022 Dar Adal predictably favours confronting Iran with meaty military manoeuvres and sanctions, but he has picked the wrong president to pursue that course with. \u2022 My guess is that while Farhad Nafisi is definitely not on the level it won\u2019t end up being North Korea he\u2019s dealing with. Perhaps Saul will end up investigating Pakistan and aggravating the locals again? \u2022 After President Trump\u2019s first week in office, Carrie advocating for the rights of Muslims in America has such added resonance. \u2022 We still need to know more about Hafiz, the man Conlin was pushing Tyrone to introduce Sekou Bah to. What do you think is going on with Farhad Nafisi? Is Carrie\u2019s apartment really being watched or is it just Quinn\u2019s paranoia? Can the new president ever trust Dar Adal?
