Pick a winner who is already commercially successful and they stand charged with telling the public what they already know; pick a winner who is too obscure and they face accusations of irrelevance. The Mercury prize has the ability to boost an artist\u2019s sales, but history provides us ample evidence it cannot turn a relatively unknown figure into a household name. The predominance of artists of relatively obscure stature on this year\u2019s shortlist had already attracted criticism from people keen to invoke the famously watertight argument that the best music is invariably the most commercially successful; among them heavyweight musical theorist Dan Wooton, of the Sun\u2019s Bizarre column, who decried the list of nominees as \u201canother snobfest from arrogant music industry luvvies who do not give a damn what the majority of the country listen to\u201d. This is clearly not an argument that holds a great weight with the judges, who have perhaps noted that based on the album charts, what the majority of the country are listening to currently includes the comedian Alexander Armstrong belting out A Nightingale Sang in Berkley Square and Danny Boy. Certainly, no one is going to accuse them of picking an artist already overburdened with mainstream attention. The bookies\u2019 favourite \u2013 a reliable guide to what\u2019s not going to win the Mercury prize \u2013 was Jamie xx\u2019s In Colour. The biggest selling album on the list was Glastonbury headliner Florence and the Machine\u2019s How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, but instead they plumped for Benjamin Clementine\u2019s At Least for Now: a number one, gold-selling hit in the London-born singer\u2019s adoptive home France, the origin of a number of inspirations he has cited including Serge Gainsbourg, George Brassens and Claude Debussy.It was also where he honed his craft busking on the M\u00e9tro, a minority interest in the UK. You can see why the French have taken to him. He is certainly not the only piano-playing vocalist who has attracted wild comparison to Nina Simone in recent years, but his style is noticeably more theatrical and florid than your average singer-songwriter: he prefers to describe himself as \u201can expressionist\u201d rather than a singer and claims he wants his voice to sound like the violin part in Vaughan Williams\u2019 the Lark Ascending. His music is unreservedly emotive and dramatic, heavy on the vocal flourishes and arrangements that hint at classical music. His speechlessness at winning the Mercury prize betrays the character of his music, which does not usually do understatement.If you are looking for a comparison, you might find one in Rufus Wainwright or previous Mercury winner Antony Hegarty; the latter another of his self-confessed influences. At its best, At Least For Now is an extremely striking album:it is also the kind of record you can imagine a wider British audience taking to if they were exposed to it. Then again, you could have said the same thing about last year\u2019s winner, Young Fathers\u2019 idiosyncratic hip hop album Dead, which the public decided to pass on, despite the extra publicity afforded it by their Mercury triumph."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
