There was something rotten at work in the summer of 1990, and probably for a good part of the decade that followed. Horses were doped, races were fixed, and dirty money was laundered, but according to the Jockey Club, it is history. Ugly and recent, yes, but history all the same. Brian Wright, the man believed to be behind it all, is currently a fugitive from justice in northern Cyprus, while several members of his drug-smuggling gang are now serving long sentences. Dermot Browne, who claims to have doped 23 horses in a six-week spree 12 years ago, is unlikely to see the inside of a British racecourse again if he lives to be 100. Yet still it is only natural for punters and racegoers to ask themselves whether all the poison has been sucked from the wound. After all, Browne's lengthy statement to a police investigation into race-fixing and doping shows that even at Grade One tracks he found the business of injecting fancied horses with a tranquiliser extraordinarily easy. He was a licensed trainer at the time, which allowed him to gain access to racecourse stables with few questions asked, but even so, activities that must have robbed punters of hundreds of thousands of pounds went unnoticed. Apart from racecourse security, there is also the question of how the Jockey Club's drug-testing regime turned up only three of the doped horses. One of those, Flying Diva at Yarmouth, was one of two runners that Browne had doped in the same race. The other went undetected. There was Argentum, the 11-4 second-favourite for the Nunthorpe at York, Ijtihaad in a Group Two at Newbury, Timeless Times at Ripon, and more than a dozen more. Punters have long memories when it comes to losers, and even 12 years later it still hurts to feel cheated. Aside from the doping, Graham Bradley and Barrie Wright, both ex-jockeys, have already admitted passing information to Wright for money during their time in the saddle, and will face punishment in due course. A number of other jockeys, though, including several who are still riding, accepted lavish hospitality from Wright including, it is said, free holidays in Spain. Michael Caulfield, for the Jockeys' Association, has rightly pointed out that simply associating with Wright is not evidence of wrongdoing. None the less, if both trainers and jockeys now realise that freebies can be dangerous things, it will be a good start. As for racecourse security and dope-testing, the Jockey Club insists, with some justification, that 1990 was a different age. The introduction of CCTV cameras in every racecourse stable is a powerful deterrent for would-be nobblers, and so too the security guards at the gate, requiring everyone to sign in and out. Mere possession of a trainer's licence no longer allows you to move about as you please. Dope-testing, meanwhile, is, according to the scientists, now at least 100 times more sensitive than it was in 1990. The challenge is to stop more crooks getting into a position where they can potentially corrupt others. In this, the Club receives surprisingly little support from the law of the land. It wants the power to examine bookies' ledgers, to try and follow the money trail when something smells fishy, and to study the police records of would-be owners. For the foreseeable future, though, its hands will be tied. Freeing those legal bonds must now be the Club's primary objective."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
