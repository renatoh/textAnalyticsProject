The Blues will blood their sixth debutant for the year, with Cam Polson named to face the seventh-placed Power on Friday night along with Andrew Phillips. Veteran duo Dale Thomas and Matthew Kreuzer have been ruled out with general soreness. Coach Brendon Bolton said the pair were still feeling the effects of the round-three win over Essendon, which was played in a torrential downpour. \u201cWe\u2019ve had two six-day breaks ... they haven\u2019t come up. They\u2019re too sore and won\u2019t play footy at all this week,\u201d he said. The 19-year-old Polson follows Harrison Macreadie, Jarrod Pickett and Sam Petrevski-Seton (round one), Tom Williamson (round three) and Zac Fisher (round four), all of whom donned the Blues guernsey for the first time in 2017. Port have been bolstered by the return of Paddy Ryder, who replaces Matt White after serving a one-game suspension. Sydney\u2019s hopes of upsetting Greater Western Sydney in Saturday night\u2019s derby at the SCG have been bolstered with Isaac Heeney, Kurt Tippett and Gary Rohan named alongside debutant Lewis Melican. Youngsters Aliir Aliir, Nic Newman and Oliver Florent have all been omitted along with Robbie Fox (knee), but Steve Johnson will return for the Giants. North Melbourne will welcome back big man Mason Wood to face Fremantle on Saturday night, while Adelaide midfielder Brad Crouch will play his first game for the season against Gold Coast at Metricon Stadium. Western Bulldogs defender Shane Biggs has been named to replace Travis Cloke (broken ribs) for Saturday\u2019s game against Brisbane, with ruckman Tom Boyd cleared to play after being concussed last week. Several clubs have opted to manage players, including Kangaroos ruckman Braydon Preuss, Giants rookie Tim Taranto and the Saints\u2019 Tom Hickey. West Coast\u2019s Sam Mitchell (ankle) headlines the injury list and will miss Sunday\u2019s clash against his old side Hawthorn at the MCG. Mitchell admits he was a long way off being able to prove his fitness to face his old side Hawthorn. The four-time premiership player had been hopeful of recovering in time to face the Hawks but says he was only 10 per cent of the way through a fitness test on Thursday morning when he knew he wasn\u2019t ready. \u201cNormally you can get to the point where you think \u2018yeah, I can convince the doc here\u2019 ... but really, I couldn\u2019t even get close enough to honestly look him in the eye and think I could contribute anywhere near enough, so I had to pull the pin myself,\u201d Mitchell told Fox Footy\u2019s AFL 360. \u201cI just wouldn\u2019t function. If it was just pain, I might have OK but there was some other stuff. I couldn\u2019t even run at half of my speed so you can imagine how slow that was. I would miss a while if I\u2019d played this one so it wasn\u2019t going to be worth it, unfortunately.\u201d Forward Jack Darling has been added to an extended 25-man West Coast squad after missing the Swans clash with an ankle complaint. The Hawks have recalled Ty Vickery but fellow off-season recruit Jaeger O\u2019Meara will miss another week as he recovers from a knock to the knee. Mitchell said he was disappointed he couldn\u2019t face his former side but hoped to be available to line up against Fremantle next Saturday. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be OK,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to get every bit of every day of improvement that I can. If I can have that same progression over the next few days, I\u2019ll be fine for next week but I need to continue to improve.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s absence comes as a blow for West Coast as they look to overcome their recent MCG hoodoo. The Eagles will start firm favourites against the winless Hawks but have still tapped Mitchell for intelligence about his former teammates. \u201cClearly I know a fair bit about Hawthorn and how they operate,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess in the position they\u2019re in right now, it is quite hard to prepare for them for this game. It\u2019s more on an individual basis - players that know they might have certain match-ups - being able to tell them about the strengths and weaknesses of players, what they like and what they perhaps don\u2019t like quite as much.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
