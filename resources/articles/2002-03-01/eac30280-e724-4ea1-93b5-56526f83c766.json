Fifa's executive committee will demand the formation of an investigation panel to look into claims that bribes of up to $100,000 (\u00a370,000) were paid to delegates to vote for Blatter in presidential elections before the 1998 World Cup finals. Next week's meeting of the executive committee was initially demanded by members calling for an investigation into Fifa's finances after the collapse of its marketing partner ISL-ISMM, which was responsible for selling World Cup television rights. The Daily Mail claimed yesterday that 18 African delegates accepted money to vote for Blatter before the elections held in Paris in 1998. \"I am not surprised to learn of such an article at this time,\" Blatter said yesterday. \"It is part of a destabilisation and defamation campaign against my person that has been ongoing for some time. \"I have responded myself several times and in full length to all allegations in connection with the election in 1998.\" There is nothing to suggest that Blatter was aware of the alleged bribery. Uefa's president Lennart Johansson, who stood against Blatter in 1998, losing by 111 votes to 80, said yesterday: \"We have to thoroughly investigate the statements made and printed in Britain with names and sworn statements for the first time that the vote for the presidency in 1998 was rigged. \"I would like this investigation to be part of an internal investigation, already set up, which was called to examine Fifa's finances following the collapse of ISL last year.\" Johansson said that he was not calling for an investigation because he lost to Blatter in the elections. \"The point now is we have to investigate the claims made to release Fifa from any sense of dishonesty,\" he said. \"We must tell the world the truth about Fifa and show that Fifa is an honest organisation. It makes sense to include it in the investigation into financial matters.\" Next Thursday's meeting was called after 13 of the executive committee's 24 members joined forces in demanding a full independent financial investigation. After the collapse of ISL-ISMM, Fifa is believed to be in desperate financial straits, leading to claims that it does not have any money and is already spending against funds it will generate from the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Fifa officials are concerned about whether the money owed by ISL-ISMM was paid before the company went bankrupt last year with debts of almost \u00a31bn. The group of 13, made up of eight from Europe, four from Africa and the South Korean Chung Mong-joon, will also demand an investigation into the bribery allegations when the executive committee meets in Zurich. If Blatter resists calls for an investigation from a majority of his own executive committee he will be in breach of Fifa regulations, plunging the organisation into a constitutional crisis. \"I am not accusing anyone of anything and I do not even care to know the names of the people who allegedly took money to change their vote,\" Johansson said. \"If these allegations are true, I think that the president himself, Mr Blatter, will have to make a judgment on his future.\" Blatter has already announced that he will stand for a second four-year term at the Fifa congress in Seoul in May, shortly before the start of the World Cup. It now appears that he may be challenged by either Chung or Issa Hayatou of Cameroon, who is president of the African Football Confederation and a member of the rebel group of 13 on Fifa's executive committee. Referring to a challenge to Blatter, Johansson said: \"It will not be me but I think you can take it there will be another candidate for the presidency.\" Further allegations against Blatter's presidency will be made in a Swiss television documentary today, increasing the pressure on him. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
