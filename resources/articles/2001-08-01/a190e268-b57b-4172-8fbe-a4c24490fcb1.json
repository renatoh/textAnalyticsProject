This art-and-gardens exhibition, however, is hardly the gallery equivalent of the earthly paradise. It's not even the Chelsea Flower Show. Antony Gormley's contribution is a 20 foot row of grey blobs arranged in order of size. Given that Gormley's speciality is making casts of his own body parts, one assumes, with some horror, that these must be multiple reproductions of his scrotum. Closer inspection reveals them to be small lead apples, tracing the development of a budding seed to fully formed fruit. It prompts one to wonder, had one of these landed on Isaac Newton's head, how much longer it would have taken for someone else to discover gravity. Spanish artist Cristina Iglesias specialises in three-dimensional \"wall pieces\", like folded dressing screens encrusted with sculptural tracery. Her Untitled (Vegetation Room IV) is a fungal cupboard lined with mossy, organic forms of the artist's own invention. The whorls and furrows occupy your entire field of vision to disorienting effect. It gives a sense of what it must be like to be a paint splash in a picture by Jackson Pollock. Gormley and Iglesias are the highlights: everything else is as empty as Takahiko Iimura's film. \"Perceive the blankness\" is one of the enigmatic subtitles that punctuate Iimura's snail's eye progress round the 16th-century Japanese stone garden of Ryoan-Gee. This is meant to embody Iimura's concept of \"ma\"; a meditative state in which time and space are one. What it actually does is establish a precedent for extreme boredom in experimental cinema. Belgian Jan Vercruysse designs garden layouts that turn out to be rather rude. None of them have actually been constructed, as few would want to live with this level of innuendo on their patio. His designs are entirely academic, moderately clever and a bit dull. A perfect summation of the whole show. \u0095 Until September 30. Details: 0114-278 2600. Mappin Gallery"}, "isHosted": false}}}
