Unlike the road, the 91km trail runs right along the shore, and gives stunning views of the iconic Twelve Apostles, the Otway and Port Campbell National Parks, sheltered beaches, pristine rivers, forests, heathland and coastal woodland. You don't have to do the whole thing - it's been designed with lots of access points so you can do short day-long sections. For details and maps see www.greatoceanwalk.com.au, or take a three-day escorted walk with Bridge &amp; Wickers (020 7483 6555; www.bridgeandwickers.co.uk) for \u00a3553, including two nights' accommodation, most meals and transfers to and from Melbourne. Discovery Climb, New Sydney Harbour Bridge Starting next month, the Discovery Climb takes tourists through stairs and catwalks used in the bridge's construction and never previously opened to the public. You wind your way through a tangle of hatchways and steel girders suspended above the traffic to the place where the arch was joined for the first time, before climbing to the summit, 134 metres above the water, to see the city before you. It takes three and a half hours and costs from AU$165 for adults and AU$100 for 16 and unders (including safety harness). Details from 00 61 2 8274 7777; www.bridgeclimb.com.au. Huski Ski Apartments The ski season down under doesn't start until June, but it's worth booking this place early, especially as it has just won the 'best ski resort' title in Wallpaper* magazine's annual design awards. Huski's ultra-stylish apartments were designed by Melbourne architects Elenberg Fraser and were inspired by the random angles of snowflakes. Located in Falls Creek, Victoria, there are 14 self-contained apartments, most with balconies with private hot tubs. Open June to October (00 61 1300 652 260; www.huski.com.au) from AU$530 for a studio for two for two nights. Sydney Wildlife World The new Sydney Wildlife World in Sydney's Darling Harbour showcases Australia's unique wildlife. Browse one kilometre of walkways across two floors to see 6,000 animals, from beautiful, rare butterflies, furry koalas and wallabies to deadly snakes and birds.
