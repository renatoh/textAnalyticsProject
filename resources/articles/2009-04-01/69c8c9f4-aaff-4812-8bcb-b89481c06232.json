Grobbelaar is currently filming for the series and will take his place alongside Anthea Turner and Adrian Edmondson when the celebrity cookery programme is broadcast tomorrow night. For Grobbelaar the date of 15 April should have as significant a resonance as it does for the families of the 96 who died as a result of the crush at the Leppings Lane end during an FA Cup semi-final. The Zimbabwean's recollection of the anguished voices saying: \"They're killing us, Bruce, they're killing us,\" evokes one of the most vivid images of the tragedy. Grobbelaar could not be contacted yesterday due to his commitments to the show. But it is understood he did not discuss the untimely scheduling of the programme with his representatives and ITV sources say it was a personal decision for Grobbelaar to be involved. Grobbelaar's agent declined to comment about his decision last night, and added he does not know if any of the former player's fee will be paid to a Hillsborough charity. But the agent did point to Grobbelaar's participation in a recent Hillsborough tribute song, The Fields of Anfield Road, as evidence of his sensitivity to the anniversary. McLaren's costly fiction Lewis Hamilton faces a possible ban from formula one but there is a growing belief in the sport that his McLaren team's dissembling in Australia could give motor racing's rulers the excuse they want to sanction the team heavily. Also in Melbourne, Sebastian Vettel caused a crash that led to a wheel spinning perilously across the circuit but the Red Bull driver was only fined $50,000 and demoted 10 grid places for Malaysia. McLaren's Australian lies will provoke much sterner punishment. Insiders believe McLaren will be punished by Max Mosley, president of the sport's governing body, the FIA, principally for its leading role in the Formula One Teams Association, which was a clear challenge to motorsport's established authorities. Days before the Melbourne grand prix McLaren's chairman, Ron Dennis, was one of three Fota men to confront formula one's commercial rights-holder, Bernie Ecclestone, in a demand for immediate settlement of unpaid funds. McLaren's fate is being interpreted as a Mosley message to the teams not to cross the FIA, one he has reinforced by carefully wooing Force India and Williams in an apparent attempt to split Fota. Mosley's carrot-and-stick approach seems to be working: already insiders say the teams' appetite for sedition is waning. Unwanted endorsement In an effort to be reinstated as England's Test No3, Michael Vaughan is tiptoeing around the side's current captain, Andrew Strauss. Vaughan, right, the Ashes-winning former captain, is so desperate not to be seen as angling for his old job back that he turned down the opportunity to captain the MCC in the season's opening match at Lord's against Durham at the weekend. So it is hardly helpful when Andrew Chandler, managing director of Vaughan's agency, ISM, chips in on the firm's website with: \"I can't help feeling that our [Ashes] chances would be much better if Michael Vaughan was steering the ship. Come back Vaughany, your country needs you.\" Game over, but game on Damian McBride was formerly one of Gordon Brown's most trusted aides until his bungled efforts at smearing leading Tories led him to quit in a north London beer garden before Arsenal's 4\u20131 win over Wigan Athletic on Saturday. McBride's resignation was swift because, he told colleagues, he wanted to get on with watching the match on TV. Perhaps No 10 would like to ask the former spin doctor which pub was illegally broadcasting the 3pm kick-off outside of the contracted hours for Premier League matches. \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 14 April 2009. We originally said that the April 15 airing of Hell's Kitchen was the first in the new series of the show, whereas it is episode three.
