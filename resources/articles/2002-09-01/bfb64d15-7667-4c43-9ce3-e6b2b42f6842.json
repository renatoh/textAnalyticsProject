The London market regained most of its losses after Wall Street recovered from a severe opening downturn. However, investors remained nervous amid concern over the prospects for economic growth and company profits. The FTSE-100 index closed at 4,011.0, down 0.4% but well above a low of 3,918.6 touched during the session. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was trading 0.7% down at the close of London trade, having recovered most of a 2.35% decline that had taken the US index to 8,227 points. Martin Dobson, head trader at NatWest Stockbrokers, said the war rhetoric in the US towards Iraq had unsettled investors. \"There's a mood of complete uncertainty about the potential damage to the economy,\" he said. Insurance firms, banks and telecoms shares led the slide. Swiss insurance giant Zurich Financial Services added to the gloom by posting greater than expected half-year losses of \u00a31.3bn and announcing plans to cut 4,500 jobs. Shares in oil companies BP and Shell also fell. Retailers suffered from fears that slow economic growth would hit sales. Traders in New York took fright at weak data from the US non-manufacturing sector. The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) index found non-manufacturing figures had fallen from 53.1 in July to 50.9 in August. The manufacturing index figures - released earlier this week - had been weak as well. \"It's all pointing in the same direction - the ISM was a surprising number and a scary number,\" John Shepherd, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, told the Reuters news agency. On Tuesday the FTSE followed the Dow into a 152-point dive, hitting a four-week low. The Dow lost 355 points on Tuesday, though it clawed back 117 points yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
