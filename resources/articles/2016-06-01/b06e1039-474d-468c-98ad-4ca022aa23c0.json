A documents cache seen by the Guardian show that the commission\u2019s in-house science service told it in 2010 that tests had uncovered what researchers suspected to be a \u201cdefeat device\u201d that could cheat emissions tests. VW was caught by US authorities last year using defeat device software that detected if a car was being driven under lab test conditions, and adjusted itself to reduce emissions of harmful nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution. Under real world conditions, the 11m VW cars affected had higher NOx emissions. The director of the EU\u2019s enterprise department claimed in April that the commission\u2019s science service, the Joint Research Centre (JRC), had failed in previous reports to flag up the risk of such defeat devices. But a report sent from the research centre to the directorate as far back as 2010 warned that its testing had found potential cheating by a car-maker. \u201cOne vehicle tested showed extremely high NOx emissions during the low temperature type 6 test,\u201d it said. \u201cSince NOx emissions at low temperature are currently not regulated, this observation hints towards a very peculiar combustion strategy (defeat strategy?) the manufacturer applies at low temperature.\u201d The device kicked in immediately after the \u201clight off\u201d of the catalytic converters and involved an \u201cartificially lean combustion strategy reducing HC/CO (high hydrocarbon/CO2 output) but increasing NOx emissions\u201d. It is not known which car maker was involved in the suspected test cheat but experts told the Guardian that the description bore the hallmarks of a \u201cthermal window\u201d defeat device, software used by numerous car manufacturers. According to the campaign group Transport and Environment, the programme turns off the cars\u2019 exhaust after-treatment systems at outside temperatures of about 17C. It has only recently been discovered and is already highly contested. JRC scientists told the European parliament\u2019s \u2018dieselgate\u2019 inquiry that they were never given a mandate to investigate the defeat devices issue further. But a note from the EU\u2019s environment department (DG Envi) in 2010 said that work on \u201cdefeat strategies\u201d was \u201can important concern\u201d for them. In 2013, an air pollution study by the department warned of: \u201cIncreasing evidence of illegal practices [by car manufacturers] that defeat the anti-pollution systems to improve driving performance or save on the replacement of costly components.\u201d As such, the documents trawl, obtained by the Dutch environmental magazines Down to Earth and OneWorld and shared with the Guardian, casts serious doubt on the European commission\u2019s competence in handling the issue. Kathleen van Brempt, the chair of the dieselgate inquiry, said that the papers were \u201cshocking\u201d and raised questions about the future of commission officials. \u201cThese documents show that there has been an astonishing collective blindness to the defeat device issue in the European commission, as well as in other EU institutions,\u201d she told the Guardian. Seb Dance, the inquiry\u2019s coordinator, said that they \u201ccompletely contradict everything the commission has told us up to now about their having had no evidence of defeat strategies being used by car manufacturers.\u201d In April, Daniel Calleja Crespo, the director of the EU\u2019s enterprise department, told the dieselgate inquiry that, despite being aware that vehicles\u2019 real-world NOx emissions were much higher than in test conditions, the commission \u201cdid not see there was cheating going on\u201d. But in November 2014, a year before the VW scandal, he had received a plea from DG Envi\u2019s then-director, Karl Falkenberg, for a response to his calls for an EU probe into defeat devices. \u201cWe continue to believe that DG Enterprise should investigate the regularity \u2013 and, if confirmed, demand corrective action \u2013 of certain current practices [in which] certain manufacturers deploy emission abatement techniques that are switched off at low temperatures or when the vehicle needs additional power,\u201d Falkenberg said. \u201cThis practice in our opinion goes beyond what is allowed by the Euro 5/6 [emissions test] legislation,\u201d he wrote in the letter. \u201cA request to look into this matter more deeply has remained unanswered so far.\u201d Crespo did not answer it in his response. He said: \u201cRegarding the application of different strategies during the type-approval test and in real driving conditions, such practices are illegal in accordance to the European law and any manufacturer applying them would face severe legal consequences.\u201d VW has yet to face any legal consequences for its use of defeat devices in Europe, despite ongoing proceedings in the US. In Europe, legal actions are a matter for nation states. But experts say that the commission had the power and, arguably, a responsibility to alert member states to the defeat devices issue. It could also have informed its legal services department and contacted car manufacturers to ask whether their cars were causing a serious environmental problem that necessitated their recall. One letter released in the trawl, from the Dutch environment minister to the EU\u2019s industry commissioner in September 2015, says: \u201cWe would like you to consider the possibilities of a European recall \u2026 to ensure that all faulty software is removed from the market and replaced by proper software that allows proper emissions reduction.\u201d \u201cThe commission should have alerted the member states\u2019 national supervisors,\u201d van Brempt said. \u201cAlthough it is not obliged, those states could have taken cars off the road, tested them and enforced the legislation.\u201d Crespo did not respond to questions sent by the Guardian. In a twist to the tale, he displaced Falkenberg last September, and is now the bloc\u2019s most powerful environment officer, after Karmenu Vella, the EU\u2019s commissioner for the environment. A commission spokesperson said that the bloc had known about the risk of defeat devices in 2014, but \u201cwas not aware of any actual instances of fraud. We were just as shocked as everyone about the revelations of the Volkswagen emissions manipulation.\u201d The official added that it was common knowledge that lab tests did not reflect real-world NOx emissions, which were up to 20 times higher, but that this could have been due to many factors. \u201cNo concrete evidence on the use of defeat devices or of the failure of a member state to act was ever brought to the attention of the commission,\u201d she said. However, another EU source was less sanguine. \u201cThe commission\u2019s position in this has been one of trying to avoid any responsibility,\u201d one told the Guardian. \u201cLegally, the responsibility for enforcement of the legislation rests with member states. Whether the commission did enough to alert those states and ensure that they were carrying out their responsibilities is a very pertinent question.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
