Given how they have sauntered through the majority of this season, it was perhaps inevitable that defeats by Catalans in the Challenge Cup semi-finals and Huddersfield last weekend were met with questions over whether the Saints were able to last the pace this year. In that context this was at least something of a silencing from the Saints on a ground where victories \u2013 certainly not ones by 20 points \u2013 do not come easily. \u201cI think we\u2019re back to our normal selves,\u201d Holbrook said. \u201cThe boys showed that tonight and it was important to do so.\u201d The platform was laid for victory here in the first half. Following a defensive performance showing few of the frailties which have plagued the Saints in their past two games, a seven-minute spell yielded 16 unanswered points. While Wakefield twice pulled that back to within a score after half-time, it always felt as though the Saints had Trinity at arm\u2019s length. Visits to Wakefield have become increasingly reliable acid tests for sides in recent years, though this defeat for Trinity now all but ends their hopes of a play-off push this season. That should not necessarily be considered a failure given their considerably lower spend than most sides. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a lot of close games this year and it\u2019s frustrating,\u201d their coach, Chris Chester, lamented. \u201cThat spell in the first half saw us come up with six errors in nine sets.\u201d The game was scoreless for 25 minutes before two tries for Tommy Makinson \u2013 the winger who continues to look like a serious contender for England honours this autumn \u2013 plus Jonny Lomax\u2019s first of the night made it 16-0 at the break. Trinity, much to their credit, hit back when Kyle Wood and Pauli Pauli crossed. But in the 10-minute period when Trinity were without Craig Huby \u2013 in the sin-bin \u2013 Theo Fages re-established a two-score lead. That was again cut when Bill Tupou scythed through but the visitors finished the stronger, tries for Luke Douglas and Regan Grace confirming restoration of their 10-point lead at the top of the table.
