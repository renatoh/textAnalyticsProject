Writing in the New York Times, Scorsese says: \u201cThe situation at this moment is brutal and inhospitable to art. And the act of simply writing those words fills me with terrible sadness.\u201d He denied that his original comments were \u201cinsulting, or \u2026 evidence of hatred for Marvel on my part\u201d, and acknowledged that \u201cmany franchise films are made by people of considerable talent and artistry. You can see it on the screen \u2026 I know that if I were younger, if I\u2019d come of age at a later time, I might have been excited by these pictures and maybe even wanted to make one myself.\u201d However, Scorsese goes on to describe his own idea of cinema, which is \u201cas far from the Marvel universe as we on Earth are from Alpha Centauri\u201d. For him and his contemporaries, as well as those he admired, he says: \u201cCinema was about revelation \u2013 aesthetic, emotional and spiritual revelation. It was about characters \u2013 the complexity of people and their contradictory and sometimes paradoxical natures, the way they can hurt one another and love one another and suddenly come face to face with themselves.\u201d Scorsese also cites cinema as an \u201cart form \u2026 equal to literature or music or dance\u201d. He adds: \u201cMany of the elements that define cinema as I know it are there in Marvel pictures. What\u2019s not there is revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger \u2026 They are sequels in name but they are remakes in spirit, and everything in them is officially sanctioned because it can\u2019t really be any other way. That\u2019s the nature of modern film franchises: market-researched, audience-tested, vetted, modified, revetted and remodified until they\u2019re ready for consumption.\u201d Scorsese names a string of contemporary film-makers \u2013 Paul Thomas Anderson, Claire Denis, Spike Lee, Ari Aster, Kathryn Bigelow and Wes Anderson \u2013 as the polar opposite of \u201ctentpole\u201d franchises, saying their work offers \u201csomething absolutely new\u201d and the potential \u201cto be taken to unexpected and maybe even unnameable areas of experience\u201d. The key point for Scorsese, however, is that the dominance of franchise movies has vastly restricted the opportunities for other kinds of films to be seen in cinemas. \u201cIt\u2019s a perilous time in film exhibition \u2026 The equation has flipped and streaming has become the primary delivery system.\u2019 Acknowledging that his new film, The Irishman, is the result of a deal with streaming giant Netflix, he adds: \u201cWould I like the picture to play on more big screens for longer periods of time? Of course I would. But, no matter whom you make your movie with, the fact is that the screens in most multiplexes are crowded with franchise pictures.\u201d He also identifies Hollywood itself as part of the problem, saying \u201cthere are some in the business with absolute indifference to the very question of art\u201d. \u201cThe situation, sadly, is that we now have two separate fields: there\u2019s worldwide audiovisual entertainment, and there\u2019s cinema. They still overlap from time to time, but that\u2019s becoming increasingly rare \u2026 the financial dominance of one is being used to marginalise and even belittle the existence of the other.\u201d In the weeks-long controversy, Scorsese\u2019s position has been backed by fellow Hollywood new wave director Francis Ford Coppola and actor Benedict Cumberbatch, with directors James Gunn and Joss Whedon defending superhero movies. Robert Iger, chairman and CEO of Disney (which owns Marvel), also defended its franchises, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t get what [Coppola and Scorsese are] criticising us for when we\u2019re making films that people are obviously enjoying going to and they\u2019re doing so by the millions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
