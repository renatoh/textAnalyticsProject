AOL, part of the Time Warner media empire, is to acquire Bebo in an $850m (\u00a3417m) cash deal. The Birches, who launched the website from their San Francisco living room in 2005, will pocket a fortune from the deal which, AOL said today, developed from talks that began five months ago. Bebo, founded by British-born Michael Birch and his partner Xochi, claims to have around 40 million monthly users worldwide. The surprise deal marks a major push by AOL to grow its social media business, which consists of AIM, a cross between messaging and social networking, and personal communications network ICQ. AOL said that the acquisition of Bebo, which has gone beyond its social networking roots to launch online dramas such as Kate Modern and strike deals with TV broadcasters, will give it a \"network of approximately 80 million unique users\". When Joanna Shields, the Bebo president, was asked in a conference call today about the Birches she said that they had been \"tremendous leaders\" and the media would \"probably hear more of them in the future\". When pressed on the Birches' plans, Shields added that the pair would be \"with us for a short period of time\", but refused to say of they were definitely leaving. \"Take that up with them,\" she added. Following the takeover, Shields will continue to run Bebo and will report to Ron Grant, the AOL president and chief operating officer. The deal will bring Shields back into contact with her former employer. Before joining Bebo in January 2007, she held a senior European executive role at Google, which owns a 5% stake in AOL. Google bought a 5% stake in AOL in December 2005 for $1bn. Randy Falco, the chief executive of AOL, painted a bullish picture of the company's plans to make Bebo the cornerstone of a \"social media powerhouse\" of assets. However, some analysts have already questioned the price AOL is paying for Bebo. MySpace had 21 million unique users in the US alone when Rupert Murdoch paid $580m for the social networking website in July 2005. Bebo has 22.4 million global users, according to comScore. Falco today defended the Bebo deal and AOL's acquisitions history generally. \"You have to look at our track record, we have been particularly prudent in what we have paid over the last few years for companies,\" he said, referring to around $1bn worth of acquisitions that AOL has made. \"Compared to the $6.1bn Microsoft paid for aQuantive and the $3bn Google paid for DoubleClick I feel we have done a pretty good job here.\" Falco added that Microsoft paid around $240m for a 1.6% stake in Facebook that valued Mark Zuckerberg's social networking website at around $15bn. He said that AOL had informed Google of the benefits of the Bebo deal, but added that the search engine company had not played any formal role in the negotiations. Ron Grant, the AOL chief executive, said that the next step was to \"supercharge the monetisation\" of Bebo by making it the centrepiece of its advertising offering Platform A. The move is a major step for AOL in attempting to completely transform its business model from a subscription- to an ad-funded operation. Falco labelled the Bebo deal a \"game changer\" for AOL. Analysts had questioned Time Warner's commitment to AOL, its online business, after the company sold off the outfit's internet access operation in Europe and is set to do the same in the US. \"The best way to answer that is that this is one more piece of evidence Time Warner has been incredibly supportive,\" said Falco. \"Strategically we think it is an incredibly important space to be in \u2026 we feel good about Time Warner [supporting AOL].\" A major winner from the deal is London-based venture capital firm Balderton Capital, which acquired a 15.7% stake in Bebo in 2006 for $15m. Balderton will $140m from selling its stake to AOL. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
