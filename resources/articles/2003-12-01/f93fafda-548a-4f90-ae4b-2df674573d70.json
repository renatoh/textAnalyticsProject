Mr Gore, who lost the 2000 presidential election to George Bush, pledged his support to Howard Dean at a rally in New York, saying Mr Dean had the \"best chance to win and the best chance to lead our country in the right direction\". The move could prove fatal to the presidential hopes of the Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman, who served as Mr Gore's running mate during the 2000 campaign. Mr Lieberman said the announcement came as a surprise, adding it was now \"less likely\" that there would be a place for Mr Gore in a Lieberman administration. Speaking in Harlem, New York city, Mr Gore said: \"Howard Dean really is the only candidate who has been able to inspire at the grass roots level all over this country the kind of passion and enthusiasm for democracy and change and transformation of America that we need in this country. \"We need to remake the Democratic party, we need to remake America, we need to take it back on behalf of the people in this country.\" Mr Gore went on: \"I have come to the conclusion that, in a field of great candidates, one candidate clearly now stands out, and so I'm asking all of you to join in this grass roots movement to elect Howard Dean president of the United States.\" Mr Gore also appealed to the Democratic candidates to maintain unity, despite their current contest for the party nomination. He said: \"This is about all of us and all of us need to get behind the strongest candidate. This nation cannot afford to have four more years of a Bush-Cheney administration.\" Mr Gore's backing, which comes come just after two vital union endorsements boosted Mr Dean's candidacy, makes him the strong favourite to win the Democratic nomination. Among his rivals are the Vietnam veteran and Massachusetts senator John Kerry and the former Nato supreme allied commander during the Kosovo war, the retired General Wesley Clark. Mr Gore will travel with Mr Dean to Cedar Rapids, in Iowa, later today for a formal endorsement and more extensive speech. Mr Dean will then fly to New Hampshire in time for a Democrat debate, the last of several held this year. As news of Mr Gore's endorsement for Mr Dean leaked last night, the Lieberman campaign issued a terse statement which said: \"I was proud to have been chosen by Al Gore in 2000 to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.\" Mr Gore ran for president unsuccessfully in 1988 and then, when a Tennessee senator, was chosen as Bill Clinton's running mate in 1992. He was vice-president through the Clinton years in office from 1992 to 2000 and had been well ahead of Bush in the polls until his campaign faltered in the final stages. During his speech in Harlem, Mr Gore defended Mr Dean's stance in opposing the war on Iraq. He also harshly criticised the Bush administration for getting American troops into a \"quagmire\" in Iraq. He said: \"Our country has been weakened in our ability to fight the war on terror because of the catastrophic mistake that the Bush Administration made in taking on the war in Iraq. \"It was Osama bin Laden who attacked us, not Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein is a bad guy and is better off not in power - we're all better off. But it was a mistake to get us into a quagmire over there. \"So don't tell me that because Howard Dean was the only major candidate who was right about that war, that somehow calls his judgment into question on foreign policy.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
