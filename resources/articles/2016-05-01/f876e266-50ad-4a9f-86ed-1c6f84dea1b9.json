Then came Kylie Minogue, cute in dungarees. Britain, it seems, has a habit of clutching petite, bubbly, blond Australian entertainers to its collective heart. But the current Aussie favourite is quite a different proposition. Rebel Wilson is naughty, witty and brash, and definitely not petite. At 36, the comic actor from Sydney, who made her name with supporting roles in Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect, has quickly become a larger-than-life feature of the comedy firmament. As a carefully calibrated, living and breathing national stereotype, Wilson is proving as difficult to ignore as Barry Humphries/Dame Edna Everage and Crocodile Dundee himself, Paul Hogan, once were. Following a succession of attention-grabbing cameos and audacious personal appearances at award ceremonies and as a guest on chatshows, last week Wilson announced that she is about to take to the stage in the West End of London for the first time. She has always been, she told fans, more than just a comedian, having been inspired to study acting by a childhood love of musical theatre. So this summer Wilson will take over the role of the lovelorn and jaded Miss Adelaide in the hit production of Guys and Dolls. The switch of cast during the summer holidays is likely to guarantee a boost in ticket sales to teenagers. \u201cAt 14, I saw my first musical, 42nd Street, after one of my family\u2019s dogs had unsuccessfully auditioned to be in it. It blew me away and I\u2019ve loved musical theatre ever since,\u201d Wilson said last week, also citing her theatre training and experience on the Australian stage. This Saturday, to prove her stagecraft, Wilson will also step out into the limelight at the Hollywood Bowl to take another leading role, as Ursula, opposite Sara Bareilles in a live performance of Disney\u2019s musical The Little Mermaid, backed by a 71-piece orchestra. In Britain, Wilson is to be spotted gracing the front cover of Marie Claire\u2019s July edition, to herald her screen appearance in the film version of Absolutely Fabulous, alongside her English comic heroine. \u201cAs a teenager I\u2019d put Ab Fab on instead of working,\u201d she said last week. \u201cJennifer Saunders was the first woman I ever saw on TV who wrote and performed her own material.\u201d The teenage Rebel \u2013 born Melanie \u2013 must have done some schoolwork however, finding quiet time away from her sisters Liberty and Annachi, and brother Ryot, because she has two degrees, including one in law \u2013 facts that might faze her army of young followers. They know her best as Fat Amy in the 2012 film Pitch Perfect and in the 2015 sequel, films that together have netted $400m in box office receipts. Her bumptious, prat-falling, over-confident character in the films was crucial to their success and in the past year Wilson has broken through to a wider audience with scene-stealing performances in the anti-romantic comedy How to Be Single with Dakota Johnson and in Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s Grimsby. Voluptuous and rude, Wilson is a reliably saucy booking. She amused crowds at the Baftas with her call for \u201cdiverse members\u201d and she has frequently shown off her more unexpected skills \u2013 clever rapping. Last week, she stormed on to the set of America\u2019s The Late, Late Show, putting would-be rappers James Corden, the show\u2019s host, and actor David Schwimmer in their place with ease. So what, for fans, is the appeal? Well, Wilson is more than an Australian novelty act. She can play other nationalities, for a start. Those who missed her as Matt Lucas\u2019s sister in Bridesmaids may have seen her comic turn as a romantically available cockney security guard in the Ben Stiller comedy Night at the Museum 4. She also wrote and starred in one season of her own sitcom, Super Fun Night, in the US. However, there was a momentary stumble in Wilson\u2019s apparently effortless glide to the top a year ago. The press in Australia, perhaps piqued by her speedy rise, pointed out that she had blurred details of her age \u2013 hardly unusual in her profession \u2013 and then took the magnifying glass to some of her kookier stories, especially one about taking up acting after a malaria-induced hallucination in Mozambique in which she saw herself receiving an Oscar. The Australian magazine, Woman\u2019s Day, ran a story claiming that Wilson had been less than truthful about her background. This month, Wilson formally complained that the articles had portrayed her as a serial liar and had cost her lucrative film roles. Filing a defamation writ in the supreme court of Victoria in Australia, the actor said her reputation and credit had suffered. She told an interviewer: \u201cAn actress has a playing age and can play within that, so why does it matter what her actual age is? I don\u2019t get that. My movie was No 1 and [the Australian press] tried to find anything they could that was bad on me. \u201cIt\u2019s a business thing because you don\u2019t want to be like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m 29, about to be 30 coming to America, great.\u2019 That\u2019s not a positive thing to do when you\u2019re an actress in Hollywood.\u201d There is, she claims, nothing phoney about the malarial fever story. \u201cPeople thought it was a comedy bit. I\u2019m like yeah, as if I friggin\u2019 made that up. I almost died.\u201d The Wilson line on her mix of talents is that she was an \u201cunusually shy\u201d child, with an attitude \u201cbordering on a social disorder\u201d. To combat this her mother, a dog breeder, drove her, kicking and screaming, to a community acting class. \u201cI was holding on to the car door and crying,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cShe had to peel me off the car. She\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019ll pick you up in two hours.\u2019 And she left me.\u2019\u201d The rest may become showbiz history, one day. The actor regularly references her size, as a kind of challenge to modern etiquette, and she is clearly entertained by the idea that she must be stupid because of her ample form. \u201cThey are like \u2018that Rebel Wilson, not much up there, but plenty here\u2019,\u201d she said recently, pointing first at her head and then at her breasts. Wilson appears to be at home in her physique: using it to poke fun at assumptions about sex appeal. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to use my brain to get places,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many glamorous people in Hollywood, I just never want to compete with that... even the men get their skin lasered.\u201d Yet for a while she was a spokeswoman for the Australian weight loss and nutrition company Jenny Craig and managed to shed a few pounds. This business relationship came to an end in 2013 when, in contrast to the conventional pressure put on Hollywood stars to maintain peak fitness between shooting films in a franchise, Wilson had to agree to stay large until Pitch Perfect 3, due out next year, is complete. Wilson is evangelical about the single life, but has sometimes questioned how success affects her chances of meeting a life partner. She told Marie Claire that she is independent spirited, \u201cto the point where I\u2019m too independent. If you\u2019re a successful woman you want to find the right person, but you don\u2019t necessarily need them... I don\u2019t know whether the right person is in Hollywood \u2013 you only meet actors or musicians here.\u201d Last year she moved out of a flat in chic West Hollywood that she had shared since 2012 with her Bridesmaids co-star, Lucas. \u201cIt means she\u2019s no longer sneezing because I think she was a bit allergic to my dogs, but we had fun and we are still bosom buddies,\u201d said Lucas, responding to Wilson\u2019s \u201cdecision to become a huge movie star and buy a house\u201d. After being cast as siblings, he added, the pair were often taken as \u201cbrother and sister, husband and wife, the same person, or all three\u201d. The actor told the Canadian magazine Flare this month that the influence of her mother has persuaded her to wait before starting a family. \u201cThe saddest thing in the world is when you see a woman who is really smart and a go-getter and then she gets married too young or has kids too young and doesn\u2019t really fulfil her dreams.\u201d The plan, instead, is to make a series of \u201cwomen-driven\u201d films, Wilson said, and she has started a production company with that in mind. She calculates that she now has the power to make a difference. Remakes of the Goldie Hawn comedy Private Benjamin, and of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, are both in train. \u201cI\u2019m at the point where I can develop projects to star in because they trust me enough to give me, like, millions of dollars,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so much fun.\u201d For others too, she must hope. THE WILSON FILE Born Melanie Wilson, 2 March 1980 , in Sydney. Her mother is a professional dog handler and her siblings are Ryot, Liberty and Annachi. Best of times In demand as the \u201cnaughty girl\u201d in the entertainment industry, next month, after film successes, she returns to live performance at the Hollywood Bowl and in the West End of London. Worst of times Accused by Australian press last year of fabricating her backstory, including not being honest about her age, and elaborating an incident in Africa. She disputes the charge that she is a serial liar. What she says \u201cThe only thing that would make this better is if Zac Efron took off his shirt right now and came and kissed me. Do you want to give me an Australian kiss now, Zac? It\u2019s like a French kiss but down under,\u201d as she won an MTV movie award. What others say \u201cBut when we met it was like complete synchronicity, we\u2019re both very laid-back and we\u2019re also quite driven professionally and I see that in her and she sees that in me but we\u2019re not competitive.\u201d British comic Matt Lucas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
