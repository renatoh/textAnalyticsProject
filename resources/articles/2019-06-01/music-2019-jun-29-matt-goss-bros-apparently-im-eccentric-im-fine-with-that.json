I\u2019m fine with that\u2019", "bodyText": "Lewisham-born Matthew Goss, 50, found fame as the frontman of 80s boyband Bros, which he formed with his twin brother Luke and their school friend Craig Logan. He launched a solo career in the 90s and now lives in Las Vegas, where he has an award-winning live residency at the Mirage casino. Bros reformed for 30th anniversary gigs in 2017, rehearsals for which were filmed for BBC documentary After the Screaming Stops, a cult hit last Christmas. Bros play Brixton Academy on 5 July and curate BBC Four\u2019s A Night in With Bros on 19 July. Are you looking forward to your homecoming show? Very much, I love coming home. Put on a pair of brogues, go shopping on Jermyn Street, feed the birds in St James\u2019s Park. I just like being an Englishman back in London. Apparently I\u2019m eccentric. I\u2019m fine with that. Who says you\u2019re eccentric? I hear it all the time, especially since the film, but I\u2019d rather be eccentric than not. I really do enjoy walking the streets and being around people who know our history. People come up and converse like they\u2019ve known me for years. I\u2019ll get into a black cab and the driver will immediately go, \u201cHow\u2019s your brother? How\u2019s Vegas going?\u201d without even saying hello first! I like it that way. What can people expect from the gig? A back-to-basics, down-and-dirty gig. No big production, a bit more rock\u2019n\u2019roll. I\u2019m playing guitar, I\u2019ll jump on the piano a couple of times. We\u2019re grown men now. We just want to plug in and play. How have rehearsals been going this time around? We\u2019re having loads of fun, actually. A couple of arguments as well, that\u2019s par for the course with me and Luke. The difference is now we\u2019re getting through them, rather than plotting to kill each other. Is having a twin like no other relationship? You understand each other better than anyone in the world. It\u2019s annoying and can be a hindrance but it\u2019s also the reason why, when we\u2019re in a room together, something magical happens. Luke\u2019s been staying with me in Vegas while we rehearse and we\u2019ve been mucking around together, just being brothers. We played Marco Polo in the pool the other day for the first time in decades, which was hilarious. Luke came along to my show that night and was sitting in the front row, still shouting \u201cMarco!\u201d I was like \u201cFuck off, I\u2019m busy!\u201d Do you look at the feud between the Gallagher brothers and feel their pain? Totally. We\u2019re big enough and ugly enough nowadays to just want to get along. It would be nice to see Noel and Liam do that too because Oasis were a brilliant band. I bet they still love each other. That\u2019s a good starting point. Did seeing you and Luke rebuild your relationship in the film inspire other estranged families? One of my mates is an ex-marine, a proper bruiser. He hadn\u2019t spoken to his mum and sister for two years but he watched the film, went straight outside and called them. He\u2019s just back from spending a week with them. Me and Luke constantly get people telling us similar stories. It was a privilege to be involved with something that stirred up that much emotion. Were you surprised by the moments that went viral? I won\u2019t bore you by stating the obvious about the editing process. A lot of those standalone soundbites are out of context \u2013 you don\u2019t hear the conversation leading up to them or the valid reasons behind them. But that\u2019s OK. Beyond all that, our sister was killed by a drunk-driver. That\u2019s real. Our mum really did die too soon. Losing them left a gaping hole in our lives. You have to figure out a way to fill that hole or you\u2019d break your ankle. One of your trademark analogies there\u2026 [Laughs] I\u2019m not going to stop speaking in analogies. Isn\u2019t that how language is meant to be used? Colourful conversations inspire me. Some people laughed at the film. Were you able to laugh at yourself too? Of course. I found a lot of those moments as funny as anybody else. Instead of curling up into a ball and dying of embarrassment, we thought: We\u2019re not done yet. We want to continue doing what we do, so let\u2019s use it as a platform. Your brother said Britain had never been proud of Bros. Are you belatedly getting respect? There can be snobbery about pop bands but to create music that chimes with millions of people is very difficult. When Bros hit the big time, people thought we were like Ken dolls but I hope people increasingly understand that we\u2019re proper musicians behind it all. Bros used to wear Grolsch bottle tops on their shoes. Did they pay you for the publicity? Thanks for asking that! Grolsch didn\u2019t pay us a penny but they bloody should have done. Apparently their sales went up by a third. What were the highlights at the height of your fame? Having lunch with Princess Diana. Water skiing in the Irish Sea with the Edge, wearing Larry Mullen Jr\u2019s wetsuit. Hanging out with the Rolling Stones \u2013 I played table tennis with Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood asked to borrow my jacket for their gig. Watching him play those guitar riffs wearing my jacket was pretty mad. Going to meet the greatest, Muhammad Ali, at his home was a humbling experience. During the World Cup last summer, we went to a pub to watch England and everyone ended up chanting: \u201cWhen, will we, will we beat Sweden?\u201d Hundreds of fans turning one of our hits into a football chant was a great feeling. Our lives have been nothing short of sensational \u2013 both good and bad. Was there ever a chance that former Bros bassist Craig Logan would rejoin the band? No. I still get on well with Craig and consider him a friend. I had lunch with him last year. But it\u2019s like a colleague you worked with decades ago \u2013 you drift apart because life gets in the way. You turned 50 last year. How old do you feel? About 33. Although my spirit is probably still 21. But I\u2019m cool with getting older and can\u2019t wait to look like my dad, frankly. He\u2019s a handsome man. How\u2019s your French bulldog, Reggie? He\u2019s a nutter but I love him. My old bulldog, Alfie \u2013 whose painting you see in the film \u2013 was a life-changing pet. We were inseparable and my ex used to say: \u201cIf he could crawl up your arse and die, he would.\u201d I swore I\u2019d never have another pet but then when Mum passed, it put everything in perspective. When I came out of the grieving period, I realised I had to start living my life again. Getting Reggie was part of that. I had a friendship with Reggie Kray \u2013 he used to call me up and read poetry to me \u2013 and always loved his name. A proper, solid British name. What else is in the pipeline? I\u2019ve written the lyrics for an Upstairs, Downstairs stage musical, which has been one of the most cerebral projects of my life. We\u2019re funded and it\u2019s headed towards the West End. We\u2019re in talks about a second film and are working on a new Bros record. And incredible things are happening for my 10th anniversary year here in Vegas. I just want to continue representing my country and be a gentleman while doing it. Bros play Brixton Academy on Friday 5 July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
