Bath only maintained their Premiership status on the final day of the regular league campaign last season but since Connolly took over in the summer they have led the league from the start and have qualified for the Heineken Cup. They are guaranteed a top-two finish in the Premiership and today take on Montferrand at the Recreation Ground in the semi-final of the Parker Pen Challenge Cup, yet Connolly is still unsure whether he will be at the club next season. \"I signed a one-year contract and a new offer is not on the table,\" said Connolly. \"I had talks with the club a month ago but nothing really came of them. If Bath do not want me I will return to Australia. I am not looking for another job in Europe; it is a question of whether Bath want me to stay. It is a case of making sure things are done properly here.\" Queens Park Rangers are considering legal action against Wasps following the rugby club's decision to remain at Wycombe next season rather than return to Loftus Road. The football club is looking for new tenants with Fulham returning to Craven Cottage. They have held talks with Brentford FC, but nothing has come of them. Rangers maintain they have a contract with Wasps that has two years to run and that they will be due compensation if the Zurich Premiership champions stay at Wycombe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
