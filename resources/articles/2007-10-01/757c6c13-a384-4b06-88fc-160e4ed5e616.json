Pictures of the couple together, for the first time since their relationship temporarily ended, emerged yesterday after they left a London nightclub together in the early hours. Clarence House said William had been concerned by the \"threatening behaviour\" of photographers who pursued the pair on motorcycles and in cars. Spokesman Paddy Harverson said the timing was \"incomprehensible\", given the continuing inquest into the death of the prince's mother and Dodi Fayed in 1997. Mr Harverson said: \"Prince William was concerned by the threatening behaviour of the paparazzi in London. Having already been photographed leaving the club, he and Kate Middleton were then pursued in his car by photographers on motorcycles, in vehicles and on foot. The aggressive pursuit was potentially dangerous and worrying for them. It seems incomprehensible, particularly at this time, that this behaviour is still going on.\" Mr Harverson said the matter has been raised with the Press Complaints Commission. In a statement the PCC said that while freelance photographers are not directly regulated by the organisation, editors must not publish photographs which are taken through harassment. \"It can of course be difficult for editors to establish the exact circumstances in which a photograph is taken,\" said the PCC. \"But it is of the utmost importance not to use photographs which have been taken in a manner that may have compromised the safety of individuals, which may include pursuit in vehicles.\" Late last night the Daily Mail was reported to have removed a paparazzi photograph from its front page, substituting a shot of the couple watching rugby. Speculation surrounding the on-off relationship of the second-in-line to the throne and the young woman who could one day be queen has sparked the same media furore which haunted the young Diana Spencer during her engagement to Prince Charles. The couple met at St Andrews University, but ended their four year relationship in April following increasing pressure from the media. Ms Middleton even contacted the PCC over alleged harassment after the Daily Mirror published a picture of her walking to work. Over the summer rumours circulated that the pair had rekindled their relationship after they were spotted at the same public events. Ms Middleton was in the royal box for the two princes' concert at Wembley in memory of their mother, although she sat apart from William. Early yesterday morning they were seen leaving London's Boujis nightclub in South Kensington. Although the couple appeared smiling and happy in the printed pictures, Clarence House said they had later become alarmed at the relentless pursuit by photographers. During Diana's inquest, which began on Tuesday, the jury has heard how photographers pursued the princess's Mercedes in cars and on motorbikes before the fatal crash in a tunnel on August 31 1997. After the pictures of William and Ms Middleton, both 25, were published yesterday, bookies William Hill closed betting on the pair becoming engaged; a spokesman said: \"As far as we are concerned it is no longer a question of if they get married but when.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
