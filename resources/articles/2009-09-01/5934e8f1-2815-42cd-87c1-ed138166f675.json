He has, however, rejoined the payroll at Lancashire. If he recovers from his latest knee surgery, and he will see a specialist on Wednesday before having a more thorough examination in November, he will cash in on his new status as a freelance cricketer in the Indian Premier League. Flintoff's international career would be over if he turned down England in favour of another one-day side but he stressed yesterday: \"I wouldn't put myself out, I wouldn't go through all this if I didn't think I wanted to be a part of the team. I want to play in the World Cup and I want to play in the Twenty20 World Cup.\" Noting England's defeat of Sri Lanka and Australia in the Champions Trophy in South Africa, he added: \"I still believe I get in England's best team.\" Flintoff, though, is unlikely to be fit to play for England before the World Twenty20 in April. Meanwhile, he says, Stuart Broad is the all-rounder who could replace him. \"Everyone forgets how young he is, just 22. In any profession you're not expected to perform at the top level until you're older but he's performing now. \"He's a natural person to fill the spot I've left open. I think, too, that Adil Rashid will play a big part. He can bat. He can quite easily bat seven. His bowling will improve. With him and Stuart in the same side the future bodes well.\" Flintoff, whose book Ashes to Ashes will be published on Thursday, is also backing his mate, Steve Harmison, to tour South Africa this winter. \"It's a given, for me. In England's most important game of the summer, the fifth Ashes Test, he was in the side, so that is an indication of what his worth is to the team. \"If you speak to any team in the world, Aussies included, this summer, about who they don't want to face and it's Steve Harmison. He'd be in my team any day.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
