As attention focused on the inexperience of England's middle order - and in particular on Ian Bell's disastrous decision to pad up to Shane Warne's slider on Saturday evening - Graveney was busy contradicting Thorpe's assertion that the selectors had ruled out a possible return to the Test team after dropping him in favour of Kevin Pietersen. \"When I informed him he wasn't playing, I did suggest on behalf of the selectors that, if at all possible, we could keep a door open until the end of the summer because we were not sure what might happen between now and September,\" said Graveney. But Thorpe had written in his Sunday newspaper column that Graveney's phone conversation with him on the Wednesday before the Test had left him with the wrong \"vibes\". \"Had David Graveney and the England selectors asked me to continue to make myself available for the rest of the Ashes series I would have done so,\" he wrote. \"He didn't say: 'You're next in line, so please continue to make yourself available.' And he didn't say: 'It's all over.' As a player, you get vibes about what the selectors are thinking. I had to read between the lines and the message I was receiving was that the door was closed.\" Two days later he announced his retirement. Thorpe's contentions drew a response from Graveney that mixed professional indignation with personal disappointment. \"I've known Thorpey for a long time and he's had some difficult times over the last four or five years,\" he said. \"So for it to be portrayed in the paper like that is sad because that just is not the truth.\" Graveney insisted that both he and his fellow selector Geoff Miller, who went to Guildford last Wednesday to speak to Thorpe during Surrey's championship match with Kent, had made it clear that his Test career was not necessarily over. \"The last thing I want to do is to cast a shadow over his career and to end up not the best of mates,\" he said. \"It came as a great shock to see how it was portrayed in the paper today. That was not a reflection of the conversations we had.\" Despite rumours that Thorpe had been told he was now behind Robert Key, Ed Joyce - the Dublin-born Middlesex batsman who is qualified to play for England - and Paul Collingwood in the pecking order, Graveney said no such discussion had taken place. Graveney added that Thorpe would have been considered had one of England's middle order been injured but the batsman yesterday made his position clear: \"My decision is irrevocable. There is no going back under any circumstances..\" It is fair to ask why Thorpe was forced into the position in which retirement was a possibility in the first place. The debate before Lord's was about Thorpe versus Pietersen but only because Bell had been given the chance to take easy runs off the Bangladeshis and boost his Test average to 297. Had the selectors not ignored the evidence of their own eyes and picked Pietersen following his demolition of South Africa's one-day attack, the choice would have boiled down to Thorpe or Bell. And, if that had been the case, the answer would have been more clear cut. Thorpe could have used his experience to add glue to the middle order one last time, while Bell could have been told his chance would come on the winter tours of Pakistan and India. Instead - and with the notable exception of Pietersen - England's batting line-up has been as adhesive as a superannuated lump of Blu-Tack. Michael Vaughan, Bell and Andrew Flintoff made 24 runs in six innings between them. Even with the imminent distraction of a new baby and perennial concerns over a dodgy back, Thorpe has been missed. Since returning to the Surrey team after a break for the Twenty20 Cup, Thorpe has made 73, three not out, 95 and 47 in the championship, and 60 and 46 in two one-day games. There seemed to be life in the old dog yet. But the selectors' failure to pre-empt a scenario that has been in the making for months has inevitably led to debate about the engine room of the England batting at a time when no debate should exist. The Ashes series was supposed to have been English cricket's big chance. It might turn out to be one big wasted opportunity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
