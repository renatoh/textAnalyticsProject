The Everton manager was spared a hostile reception at Goodison Park on Saturday as his team produced an encouraging display and comfortable 2-0 victory against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. The January signing Cenk Tosun and an own goal from Ga\u00ebtan Bong gave Everton their ninth home league win of the season \u2013 equalling their number of away defeats \u2013 as Chris Hughton\u2019s side, reduced to 10 men when Anthony Knockaert received a straight red card for an idiotic challenge on Leighton Baines, endured their first defeat in eight games. Allardyce had received fierce criticism after the defeat at Burnley the previous week and said he had sleepless nights in the buildup to the game against Brighton. Only his experience, the 63-year-old admitted, enabled him to handle the pressure \u2013 and he savoured victory by watching Ant and Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway. On the prospect of fans turning on him on Saturday, Allardyce said: \u201cWe all knew that could happen and it rears its head again next week if we play badly [at Stoke City]. It is just what we live with. I would say that I am all right where I am now but I wouldn\u2019t be all right if I was 15 years younger. The pressure. If I was young and just breaking in here, I am not so sure I could cope with the sort of pressures that are put on managers today. Not without the experience I have now. \u201cMy job is to absorb the pressure and keep it off the players and take the stick. There is that much information and that much knowledge put out there for fans, it makes them more demanding and the more demanding it makes them the more we have to try to deliver. And again that demand comes from inflated prices and how much we have to pay for players. Then in turn that makes the fans think the player should be delivering more and that gets them more upset.\u201d The Everton manager added his post-match celebrations are more restrained than in his younger days, however. \u201cI can chill out now and actually sleep quite well. In the younger days I would have been out with all my mates, not football mates, the mates I know, and celebrating. Tonight I can take it easy and watch Ant and Dec.\u201d Everton\u2019s display was orchestrated by Wayne Rooney from a holding midfield role, with the 32-year-old asked to sit deep in the absence of Idrissa Gana Gueye and Morgan Schneiderlin through illness. Allardyce admitted Rooney could continue in that role when Gueye recovers. The manager said: \u201cI asked him if he was all right with it and he always says \u2018yes\u2019. If you look at how many positions Wayne played in for Manchester United \u2013 wide right, wide left, in the hole, up front. Here he has been midfield, front line, in behind the front man and now the sitting midfielder in a three and he prompted the game very well. It is not always the case a midfielder in that position has to be a good defender. He has to be a really good passer for me and if he is a really good passer then we do less defending and get more attacking movements.\u201d Hughton, by contrast, was bewildered by Brighton\u2019s subdued performance and the challenge that will mean Knockaert misses Saturday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final at Manchester United through suspension. \u201cI have no answer for it,\u201d said the Brighton manager, who will discipline the midfielder. \u201cIt is a red card and I can\u2019t defend it. We can\u2019t afford to lose players. We have got eight league games left and we play four of the big teams, so it is an incredibly tough finish for us. With that run-in we will need the performances that we have put in in recent games and we will need as many players as possible.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
