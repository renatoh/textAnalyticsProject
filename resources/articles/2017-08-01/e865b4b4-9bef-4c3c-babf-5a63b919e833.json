As the number of quality politicians and civil servants declines, so our role on the world, and now European, stage has waned. If we are not to vanish further into the wings, talented, well-balanced and influential individuals from all disciplines of the private sector, such as Rayner, need the courage and determination to engage with our ailing government departments from the inside for the greater public good, regardless of personal discomfort. Stuart Houghton Lancaster Brexit does indeed risk \u201cexposing UK consumers to much lower food standards than we have come to expect\u201d, especially if a \u201cvery big, very powerful\u201d trade deal is signed \u201cvery, very quickly\u201d, as Donald Trump suggested. US trade deals are governed by a providential principle that permits marketing anything not yet proved dangerous. But the EU follows the precautionary principle, whereby the goods may not be marketed unless they have been proved not to harm the consumer or environment. Which principle the \u201cgreat repeal bill\u201d opts for is of crucial importance for British consumers. David Murray Wallington, Surrey Jay Rayner\u2019s otherwise welcome warning report of a possible food supply and price crisis paid scant attention \u2013 and only in relation to retailers \u2013 to the outrage of food waste. No one wants to see people struggling to feed their families and facing inflated food costs, but don\u2019t we need to look after ourselves in this regard? And is it only the comfortably off who throw away perfectly edible food? As with the problem of debt, has it become unacceptable to advise people to put their own house in order? Dr Alan Rhys-Thompson Manchester Notwithstanding my endorsement of Jay Rayner\u2019s Govian sentiments, I ask how he arrived at the conclusion that the carbon footprint of allotment gardening is \u201cappalling\u201d. The only footprints on my organically run allotment are my own. Far from it being \u201cgood for mental wellbeing\u201d, it is more likely that I will be driven insane by adverse weather, bindweed and the marauding antics of muntjaks, all for the sake of a supply of potatoes, courgettes, runner beans, carrots etc, which are to be found just around the corner. Tony Edwards Watchfield, Oxfordshire What a very interesting article from Jay Rayner. There is a connection with Lucy Siegle\u2019s article on throwaway fashion: supermarkets (\u201cIt\u2019s time we got over our addiction\u2026\u201d, Viewpoint). Years ago, there were two seasons \u2013 summer and winter \u2013 with sales in January and July. The introduction of mass-produced cheap clothes by supermarkets changed this. In order to buy clothes cheaply, production had to be guaranteed and new collections appear every six weeks.
