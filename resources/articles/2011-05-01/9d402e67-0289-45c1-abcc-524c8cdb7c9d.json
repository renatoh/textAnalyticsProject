While the Manchester City manager has been adamant all week that his captain will start next season at Eastlands, Tevez gave an interview to Argentina's Radio del Plata in which he was reported to have said: \"I have given my everything to the club but I need a change of scene.\" However, Mancini maintains that his captain is going nowhere and countered by remarking that when he had appeared to suggest in the Italian media that the striker might leave for Serie A, Tevez had confronted him. \"I don't know if he has said these things,\" the manager said. \"I didn't say what he thought I said but Carlos came to me and said: 'Why did you say this?' I told him I never said it but I also told him that I didn't know whether he wanted to go to Italy. Carlos said he wanted to stay. Finished. That is history.\" In terms of how much the world's wealthiest club are prepared to spend this summer, the immediate future may be dramatic. The club's chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, had said only one or two players might be required while City's football administration officer, Brian Marwood, argued that Mancini merely needed to tinker with the squad. These were suggestions Mancini appeared to reject, saying he would be unlikely to win the league with his current players. \"In football anything can happen; we could sell Carlos and win the title because football is very strange,\" he said. \"This year we have worked well but we need to improve. We need to buy other good players, keep Carlos and, after that, I think we can do better than this season.\" Mancini also ruled out a move for Cristiano Ronaldo this summer. After two seasons without any significant trophies at Real Madrid, it has been claimed that the Portuguese is ready to leave the Bernab\u00e9u. A \u00a3150m price tag is said to have been put on a player who cost Real a world-record \u00a380m when he left Manchester United after the 2009 Champions League final. The manager laughed at suggestions that he may be interested in Ronaldo. \"We have signed Cristiano Ronaldo for \u00a3200m,\" the Italian joked. \"I said after the FA Cup final I would like to sign Ronaldo, [Lionel] Messi, [Cesc] F\u00e1bregas and [Andr\u00e9s] Iniesta. I don't think it is possible. Mancini said his chairman understood the difficulties of competing on two fronts, something that has been beyond Tottenham this season, as it was beyond Sampdoria when Mancini was a player. Mancini recalled that in 1992 Sampdoria had reached the European Cup final but finished sixth in Serie A. \"It is really difficult if you don't have a good squad of 23-24 good players,\" he said. \"If you don't have that, you could end up like Tottenham. They put all their energy into the Champions League and lost many points in the Premier League. \"Manchester United have experience of winning many trophies; they probably played with an entirely different side (against Schalke) in the semi-final than they will play in the final of the Champions League. That is saying something. \"Manchester City need to improve. We need to buy other players and also young players because we need them. At the moment we don't have good young players who during the season can play in the first team.\"\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
