Rather than requiring that its customers wear masks when entering and walking around the premises \u2013 as pretty much every other small business does around the country \u2013 the owners actually ban the use of masks. That\u2019s right: no service if you\u2019re wearing a mask. Yaks Cafe in Blanding, Utah, a town of about 4,000 people located in the south-east corner of the state, has been resisting the mask-wearing requirement even in the wake of rapidly rising Covid-19 cases and the dismay of local public health officials. \u201cWe find it really saddening,\u201d the county\u2019s public health department executive director, Kirk Benge, told the Salt Lake Tribune. \u201cBut we\u2019re still in discussions with the county attorney about what we feel would be the best course of action.\u201d According to the Tribune report, health departments in the state are not able to enforce the mandated mask-wearing and social distancing guidelines established earlier this summer, even though a violation of the rules could bring fines and even jail time. Yaks isn\u2019t the only restaurant taking an anti-mask stand. Businesses from California to Montana are also fighting the mandates. The owner of Yaks Cafe, who refuses to talk to the media, remains adamant. Both a Facebook post, which has since been made private, and the restaurant\u2019s answering machine reminds customers of its no mask or gloves policy \u201cin efforts to keep our restaurant clean and sanitary\u201d. A sign posted in the restaurant says \u201cNo masks! No! No gloves! No! No masks! No! Are allowed in the cafe!\u201d You see? It\u2019s for \u201csanitary\u201d reasons that masks aren\u2019t required. Got it. Business owners \u2013 like the owners of Yaks \u2013 have every right to question the need for such mandates, that\u2019s free speech. But the fact is that we live in a democracy and in this democracy we vote for our leaders who then appoint and oversee government officials, including health administrators. These are the people who set the rules which, they feel based on their experience, are in the best interests of the public. That\u2019s the way it works here. If you don\u2019t like it, then vote to change it. Otherwise, as business owners \u2013 and good citizens \u2013 we need to abide by those rules. The owners of Yaks are not doing this. Maybe they truly believe it\u2019s within their constitutional rights. Or maybe they\u2019re just marketing geniuses and know how to get a lot of media attention. Their actions will turn off many \u2013 \u201cThis makes me wanna yak,\u201d one reddit user posted. But then again there will be people who agree, like this Twitter user who stands behind the cafe and believes that it\u2019s the \u201cone restaurant that is taking a stand (because) mask(s) leave more pathogens on the surfaces\u201d. You can argue about how effective masks are, if you want to. But that\u2019s not the point. This story is about playing by the rules, and unlike just about every other small business in this country who are reluctantly facing the same challenges, the owners of Yaks are not doing this. And that\u2019s just bad business."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
