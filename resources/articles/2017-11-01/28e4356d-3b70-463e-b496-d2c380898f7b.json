The Denmark manager, Age Hareide, took no satisfaction from the fact that his pre-match assessment of this Republic of Ireland team turned out to be prophetic. Martin O\u2019Neill, meanwhile, is happy that Ireland\u2019s World Cup fate will be determined in Dublin, a goalless draw ensuring the suspense in this play-off will carry over into Tuesday\u2019s second leg. O\u2019Neill conceded, mind you, that his team will have to show more creativity to profit from their home advantage. It would have been ludicrous to claim otherwise given that here they treated the ball like almost as much of an adversary as the Danes, with both kept mostly at a distance. Each manager complained afterwards about the bumpiness of the pitch but the Danish players made it look smoother than the Irish. \u201cWe would obviously want to be better with the ball in Dublin,\u201d said O\u2019Neill. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to be, in all honesty, to score a goal. [The tie] is very evenly poised. [Hareide] said they\u2019re capable of scoring at the Aviva and I wouldn\u2019t doubt that. With the players they possess they\u2019re capable of scoring a goal so we might have to score two to win the match. But we\u2019re capable of that.\u201d Ireland will be at full strength on Tuesday, as none of their eight players who started this leg on a yellow card received another one. David Meyler, forced to sit this out, will return from suspension. This was a disciplined and spirited Irish performance. Yes, the highlights of the clash could be condensed into a couple of minutes but this team will enter Irish football\u2019s history books if the eventual outcome is qualification for a first World Cup since 2002. As for those highlights, Darren Randolph will feature prominently. The goalkeeper made three fine saves here to thwart the Danes when they managed to penetrate the Irish defence. All that was missing for the visitors was a breakaway goal, which Cyrus Christie almost pinched just before half-time before being foiled by Kasper Schmeichel. Despite knowing how Ireland would play, Hareide probably did not foresee the inclusion in Ireland\u2019s staring lineup of Callum O\u2019Dowda, the 22-year-old whose only previous start for his country was in the relatively sedate setting of last month\u2019s home match against Moldova. Deploying the Bristol City winger on the right enabled O\u2019Neill to shift Robbie Brady into the central midfield berth vacated by Meyler, thus, in theory, giving Ireland more thrust than they would have had if the more experienced Glen Whelan had started instead. That selection raised the possibility that O\u2019Neill had not been bluffing in the previews when declaring his intention to \u201cgo for it\u201d. Wrong. He was bluffing. After some helter-skelter early exchanges, the contest settled into the pattern that Hareide predicted, Denmark dominating and Ireland defending deeply and doggedly. The role of Daryl Murphy, alone up front for the visitors, seemed ceremonial. Although the Danes regularly fed Christian Eriksen in the hope that the Tottenham Hotspur schemer would concoct some ingenious way of unpicking a defence led by Shane Duffy, the hosts were not overly intricate and did not forsake the aerial route. That path would have led to a goal in the 10th minute if not for two saves by Randolph. The Middlesbrough goalkeeper parried a volley from the left-hand side of the box by Stryger Larsen after a long diagonal pass by Simon Kjaer and then blocked the follow-up by Andrea Cornelius. Before fading in the second half Eriksen created mischief in the tight space between the Irish midfield and defence. In the 22nd minute his long-range shot brought a routine save from Randolph. The goalkeeper was in greater difficulty when Eriksen tried again 10 minutes later, his effort swirling so wildly that the goalkeeper spilled it. Randolph was grateful to see Pione Sisto guide the rebound wide. Schmeichel was just another frustrated spectator until the 42nd minute, when Christie dashed down the right and into the box in a manner in which the injured Seamus Coleman would have been proud. The right-back tried to dink the ball over Schmeichel from close range but the goalkeeper stood strong. The steadfastness of Ireland\u2019s resistance seemed to cause Denmark to lose their poise. The second half descended into a scrappy duel, suiting the visitors more than the hosts. Eager for a twist, the home crowd cheered Nicklas Bendtner\u2019s introduction in the 73rd minute. The former Arsenal and Sunderland striker made no impact. Yussuf Poulsen, however, nearly snatched a goal in the last minute but Randolph tipped his close-range header over the bar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
