The announcement at a meeting at Hampden Park, called to discuss broadcasting rights for next season, left Celtic and Rangers expressing their \"surprise and disappointment\" at the split. Under league rules the 10 clubs had to give two years' notice of their intention to break away. \"The clubs require to take control of their destiny,\" said the Hearts chairman Chris Robinson. \"Any new league will be founded on fairness in terms of voting structure of a pattern similar to the English Premiership. This distribution is much fairer than in the current SPL.\" At present the league clubs need Celtic and Rangers to vote for a proposal before it can be carried. The clubs want to introduce a system similar to the English Premiership, with a two-thirds majority vote. The decision comes after the collapse of the SPL television channel last week, vetoed by Celtic and Rangers. The breakaway move would appear to leave the Glasgow clubs stuck between a rock and a hard place. They are known to want to join the English leagues but there are major obstacles to be overcome. Uefa and Fifa would have objections and, under existing regulations, if the Old Firm were to join the First Division all 72 clubs in the Football League would have to agree. That is one reason why the First Division is seeking autonomy from the rest of the league. The 10 Scottish clubs have said the pair could join the newly formed league, but that would be with the Old Firm's voting power greatly reduced. There is, though, a third possibility - that Celtic and Rangers could launch their own league and persuade members of the breakaway group to join it. The West Bromwich Albion chairman Paul Thompson said yesterday that Rangers and Celtic would be welcomed in England but only if their inclusion cemented the relationship between the Premiership and the First Division. \"We have all got to look at what is in the best interests of the country, that's Britain, as a whole,\" Thompson said. \"From an English point of view we need to protect the competition between the Premier League and First Division, and if Rangers and Celtic helped then that can only be positive.\" It emerged yesterday that the BBC had proposed to cover the SPL on terrestrial television, but the terms of the deal were not known. There is currently no TV deal for next season. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
