My own reactions ranged from bafflement, through a vague sense of hectoring persecution, to a grudging acceptance that this is in some way inevitable. Right now it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Beckham will simply never go away. The World Cup is barely cold in the ground; we may have been jilted horribly at the altar, left raw and giddy and snot-smeared in our smudged wedding lace, but here he is again \u2013 here's mummy, a single liver-spotted hand clenching our wrist, leaning in and breathing into our face and saying: \"It's OK, dear. You'll always have me. Always. Always.\" Not going away is a new thing. People used to go away. England's 1966 World Cup winners went away for decades. Beckham, though: not so much. In ambassadorial semi-retirement his sole outstanding quality is an absolute refusal to go away. This is his thing and it would be a mistake to assume that it makes him in some way an irrelevance or a side issue. Beckham was, after all, the only England footballer to have a great World Cup, albeit mainly this was down to the fantastic expression on his face throughout: concerned, interested, but also let down and \u2013 crucially \u2013 not really involved or to blame in any way. And at the end of it all he is still England's most famous footballer. He really is. If Wayne Rooney could have scored just a couple of times, this would probably not be the case. But he didn't, and so here we are again, nodding sagely, gripped with a kind of diffuse, manly potato love as Beckham muses on his hopes and fears, his face a forbidding visage of unarguable A-list authenticity, albeit the World Cup suit and whiskers made him look a bit like a sprightly Victorian cartoon badger who works at the Bank of England. There are sound structural reasons why Beckham won't go away. Mainly, there simply isn't the machinery now to displace him. Beckham accumulated his barely credible degree of fame on the back of a ferocious economic and sporting boom. Irresistible tectonic forces propelled his rise. This was a land grab and, like Apple and Microsoft, Beckham got there first. On the far side of the gold rush there simply isn't the wherewithal to make, say, Jack Rodwell incredibly famous in Japan. Jack Wilshere's haircut will never be mimicked by the Chinese. Beckham may have seemed like the start of something. He was instead the culmination of a moment. And now he has crossed over into an ossified, unassailable realm where, watching him this week, everything he does feels like a scene in an infomercial for David Beckham, or a high-budget adulatory American biodoc about David Beckham. It is also clear that simply ignoring Beckham won't work. This is because we all get the ultimately destructive celebrity figureheads that we deserve. Beckham was a fine player, but in his late stage incarnation as \"David Beckham\" \u2013 every appearance a kind of Vegas-style tribute act; still twinkly, still recognisably an eager hobbling horse with a severe right foot; and applauded, in the American way, simply for being David Beckham \u2013 he has become an emblem of skewed priorities. The machinery that is still so eagerly hoisting the fixed, looming California-grilled Beckham visage on to its elite soapbox represents an entire multi-chapter segment in the story of Everything That's Wrong With English Football. Craven obsession with celebrity. Insatiable centralised revenue- chasing (what was he actually doing in South Africa, anyway?). And, above all, a sense of congealment, of a handsomely branded stasis. These things, you feel, aren't about to go away just yet either. twitter.com/barneyronay"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
