Trade unions said management had told them on Friday there was \"a big chance\" that the Sabena holding company, excluding subsidiaries, would be put into liquidation this week since no new investors had been found. A Belgian court granted the airline a two-month bankruptcy protection early last month after co-parent Swissair, which owns 49.5% of the company, reneged on its promise to stump up cash for the airline. The Belgian government owns the rest of Sabena. Sabena hinted at the liquidation option in a memo to staff last week, saying no investors were likely to want the whole Sabena group, but said it hoped to continue some activities through its Delta Air subsidiary. The government sent extra police to Zaventem international airport to contain any labour protests in case of a bankruptcy filing this week, officials said. Belgian newspapers have reported that the board of Sabena could decide tomorrow to file for bankruptcy after acknowledging that no investor wants to take over its airline activities. The Brussels daily Le Soir said that Sabena is progressively repatriating its aircraft so they will not be seized in foreign countries in preparation for bankruptcy. The newspaper speculated that after bankruptcy is filed tomorrow at the Brussels commercial court, airline management and the government hope that Sabena's airline activities can restart the next day. They would like to transfer part of Sabena's assets to Dat, while the search continues for a new investor to take over. Le Soir said that if no investor comes forward over the next few days, Sabena's management could ask the bankruptcy administrator to allow the airline's activities to go on as they pursue negotiations. The failure of negotiations could lead to the liquidation of Sabena's assets and the loss of about 10,000 jobs, Le Soir reports.Trade unions protested the deployment of some 150 extra police at the airport today. \"It is a scandal. For weeks, we have been asking for social measures and instead we get police,\" said Denis De Meulemeester, a union official. A Belgian court granted Sabena bankruptcy protection last month, giving management and the government until November 8 to come up with a rescue plan. The filing followed the failure of co-owner Swissair, hit by its own cash crunch, to come through with a promised injection of $123m (\u00a384m) in fresh capital. Sabena was forced to seek bankruptcy protection after reporting a loss of 138.9m euros (\u00a384m) in the first half of 2001, and 55.3m euros more than the year before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
