He believes that life evolved on this planet a couple of billion years ago in the oceans beside the hydrothermal vents, which are gigantic geysers of hot minerals bringing heat and chemicals up from the molten core. These formed single-celled life, which, he says, inevitably led to multicellular life, and eventually all animals and plants. However, you could not become you without carbon, which is made out of the explosions of far-distant suns so, literally, parts of you have been around for billions of years in other parts of the galaxy. Pretty cool, huh? Of course, everyone knows the answer is 42. (See Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.) \u2022 Spamalot, which is suitable for Killian's age, opens at The Playhouse Theatre, London WC2, on 12 November. What About Dick?, which is not, is available for digital download on 13 November. Are you 10 or younger and have a question that needs answering?
