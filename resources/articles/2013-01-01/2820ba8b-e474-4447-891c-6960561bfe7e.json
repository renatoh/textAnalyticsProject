England have called up the uncapped Worcester flanker Matt Kvesic and recalled Mouritz Botha and Ugo Monye as injury cover for their Six Nations training camp in Leeds this week. Calum Clark (shoulder) and Tom Johnson (knee) are to remain with their clubs for treatment and, as such, appear to be out of contention for England's opening match at Twickenham on 2 February. Courtney Lawes and Manu Tuilagi are also nursing injuries following a bruising European weekend and will be assessed in Leeds. The injury to Burns is a recurrence of a problem the fly-half had in pre-season, when he was out of action for three weeks. It happened during the buildup to Gloucester's first try against Mont-de-Marsan at Kingsholm and within 12 minutes the 22-year-old had limped off to be replaced by another of Stuart Lancaster's squad, Billy Twelvetrees. Burns, third in line for the England No10 shirt behind Owen Farrell and Toby Flood, made his Test debut as a replacement in last month's victory over the All Blacks. Gloucester believe it will be 48 hours before the severity of the injury is known. The Gloucester director of coaching, Nigel Davies, said: \"Freddie has a problem with the medial ligament in his left knee, similar to what he had in pre-season. That kept him out for about three weeks. Fingers crossed this won't be any worse than that.\" Gloucester's victory sees them through to the Amlin quarter-finals but Davies was less than pleased at the behaviour of the French. On Saturday Davies said his tighthead prop had been kicked in the head and that some of the French behaviour in the scrum was \"unacceptable\" and would be reported to the citing officer. \"There were several incidents again that left our players frustrated to say the least,\" Davies said. \"Shaun Knight was especially incensed by one incident, and we'll certainly be referring that to the citing commissioners. There were a couple of kicks to the head.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
