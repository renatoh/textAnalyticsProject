Former IT worker Julian Hodgkins, 37, was arrested after posing as a charity collector in the centre of Reading, Berkshire, on January 4. Reading magistrates court heard he had conned the public in order to buy drugs after being overheard saying: \"I will make some money out of this.\" Hodgkins, of Alder Close, Lower Earley, Reading, last month pleaded guilty to dishonestly obtaining the cash by deception. The court heard today that he had set out for Broad Street, in the centre of Reading, dressed in fluorescent clothing and holding a bucket, purporting to be collecting money for a tsunami appeal. Taira Kauser, prosecuting, told the court that police were called after receiving information about what Hodgkins was doing. An officer overheard him telling another man that he would \"make money\" and, when asked for identifiction, he could produce only a rent card, claiming he had left his ID at home. The court heard that police had found \u00a312.01 in Hodgkins' top pocket. At an earlier hearing, the court heard that he had collected around \u00a319, but had given some of the money to beggars. Hodgkins was taken to Reading police station, where he admitted he had set out to collect the money to feed his girlfriend's drug habit. However, tests showed that he had also been taking cocaine and opiates. Lee Evans, chairman of the panel of magistrates, told Hodgkins that his early guilty plea had spared him a jail term. However, he ordered him to carry out 80 hours of community service and placed him on a 12 month community rehabilitation order. The court also ordered that the money found in Hodgkins's possession should be paid to a charity working for tsunami victims."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
