Ax was 70 last month, and the Wigmore Hall was packed for a belated, generous birthday tribute that was devoted entirely to music by Schumann, in which Ax played solo piano pieces and chamber music as well as accompanying lieder. The choice of composer was a revealing one, for though Ax has an impressively wide-ranging repertory, from Bach to living composers including Adams and Gruber, early romantic music has always seemed to bring out the very best from him. The two solo works by Schumann that he included, the Arabeske Op 18 and the Op 12 Fantasiest\u00fccke, epitomised his self-effacing mastery of lyrical miniatures, every phrase perfectly conceived and balanced, his warm, velvety tone never threatening to become strident in even the most forceful passages. And when he partnered Simon Keenlyside in Dichterliebe, the quiet poise of Ax\u2019s playing, especially in the solo postludes that are such a feature of this song-cycle, contrasted tellingly with the baritone\u2019s more intense, sometimes almost histrionic approach. The Dover Quartet joined Ax for the chamber works, the Piano Quartet Op 47 and the Piano Quintet Op 44. If the performance of the quartet had been a bit routine, despite the Mendelssohnian sparkle that Ax brought to its scherzo, then the quintet that ended the concert was much more convincing, with the pianist taking a dominant role and leading the way to end this three-part celebration in exactly the exhilarating way it deserved."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
