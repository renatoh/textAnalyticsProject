The National Audit Office (NAO) discovered that as attempts to develop bespoke technology failed, civil servants turned to G4S for a new tagging contract even though the outsourcing firm is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. A report released on Wednesday describes a chaotic picture of the department\u2019s handling of the project, launched six years ago under the then justice minister Ken Clarke, and supposed to be a cheaper and efficient alternative to prison. Annual monitoring costs were supposed to drop by \u00a39m but instead, costs up to March this year have increased by \u00a360m while the old system is still in use, the report said. The department failed to achieve value for money in its management of the service, which is expected to cost \u00a3470m between 2017-18 and 2024-25, auditors found. The cabinet ministers who have overseen the project since Clarke are Chris Grayling, Michael Gove, Elizabeth Truss, and the incumbent David Lidington. Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said that the department had not even established whether an expansion in tagging was needed before committing public money to a failed project. \u201cThe case for a huge expansion of electronic monitoring using GPS was unproven, but the Ministry of Justice pursued an overly ambitious and high-risk strategy anyway. Ultimately, it has not delivered. \u201cAfter abandoning its original plans, the Ministry\u2019s new service will now, ironically, be much closer to its existing one. Even if it launches in 2018, it will still be five years late,\u201d he said. Since 1999, the government has used contracted-out electronic monitoring, or \u201ctagging\u201d, services for the sentencing and supervision of offenders. The system is used by police, courts or probation services to monitor offenders\u2019 locations and compliance with home curfews. In 2011, the department launched a programme to develop a new \u201cworld-leading\u201d ankle tag that combined radio frequency and GPS technology. Auditors found that the Ministry did not do enough to establish the case for location monitoring using GPS. \u201cThe Ministry assumed there would be high demand for location monitoring from those who sentence offenders but did not run a pilot to test this before launching the programme,\u201d the review said. \u201cIt also did not understand the potential financial costs and benefits of expanding location monitoring.\u201d Capita was asked to co-ordinate four suppliers, each of whom would provide different elements of the service, but the project quickly ran into problems, the report said. One firm, Buddi, was appointed as a preferred bidder in 2013 to produce the tags, but left six months later after a row over sharing data. Another supplier, Steatite, only had seven employees on the programme when it was appointed, but was expected to attend up to 40 meetings a week related to the programme. The MoJ is \u201conly now\u201d running location monitoring pilots to test how the use of a GPS tag might affect the behaviour of offenders, the report noted. Auditors concluded that the department\u2019s bespoke requirements for world-leading tags proved too ambitious; the new tags are now expected to be deployed from the end of next year \u2013 five years later than planned. The original projections suggesting that between 160,000 and 220,000 offenders would be tagged were exaggerated and instead, the programme is expected to be for under 65,000 people. An SFO investigation into allegations of overcharging in the main electronic monitoring contracts of offenders in England and Wales began in 2013, when a general ban was imposed on G4S and a second company, Serco, from bidding for any government work. The ban was lifted in 2014 when G4S agreed to repay \u00a3109m and put in place a \u201ccorporate renewal plan\u201d to prevent any recurrence. Richard Garside, the director of the centre for crime and justice studies, said the bespoke tagging programme had been so shambolic that it resembled an act of sabotage. \u201cIt would be better if the ministry scrapped this pointless vanity project, stuck with the tried and tested radio frequency technology, and addressed more pressing problems, such as the prisons and probation crises,\u201d he said. A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: \u201cAs the National Audit Office makes clear, there were challenges in the delivery of the electronic monitoring programme between 2010 and 2015. \u201cAs a direct result, we fundamentally changed our approach in 2015, expanding and strengthening our commercial teams and bringing responsibility for oversight of the programme in-house. \u201cWe are now in a strong position to continue improving confidence in the new service and providing better value for money for the taxpayer.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 July 2017. Steatite had seven employees on the programme when it was appointed, not seven employees in total as an earlier version suggested."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
