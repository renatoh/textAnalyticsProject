That frozen timepiece is an appropriate image for a poet whose best work seems to still time, to suspend a moment of clear-sighted observation. The 142, mostly slender, poems he left behind are timeless in a more obvious way, too. As the list of contributors to Branch-Lines - a kind of posthumous festschrift of poems and essays - shows, his influence is still profound: Geoffrey Hill, Seamus Heaney, Andrew Motion, Penelope Shuttle, Anne Stevenson, Paul Muldoon and Peter Porter are among the 56 writers and critics queuing up to sing the praises of a poet whom Ted Hughes acknowledged as \"the father of us all\". If Thomas has a reputation as \"a poet's poet\", it's partly down to the lambent purity of those poems, which he took to writing only in the last few years of his life. Walter de la Mare wrote that Thomas had \"unlearned all literary influences\". That's by no means true, but it reveals something important about the simplicity of his diction and forms. Yet clarity and simplicity may well be mirages; they are the hard-won result of Thomas's attention not merely to things-as-they-are - to nettles, or rain, or the ploughed earth - but to the inner processes of memory, perception, naming and thought. The poems in this inestimable book are in no way all homages; still less are they imitations or pastiches. But they are all indebted in some way to Thomas. Where appropriate, the relevant Thomas poem is printed alongside its modern descendant. So Heaney's \"Edward Thomas on the Lagans Road\" appears next to \"As the team's head-brass ...\", off which it plays. Many echoes may be heard: noting that Thomas has appeared in translation in Japan, Penelope Shuttle recasts him as a kind of Basho in \"Edward San\", in which \"a pure thrush word / spreads its calligraphic wings / over Kyoto\". The thrush's cry, from Thomas's \"The Word\", is remade here as an enigmatic emblem of poetic influence. Elsewhere the debt is more glancing, or unacknowledged. Matthew Hollis writes of the ways in which poets may be influenced by poems they have never even read, \"rather like the way conversation can move across a crowded room\". Thomas's intense preoccupation with the detail of rural lives and landscapes has led many to see him as pre-eminently a poet who hymns a vanishing England. But just as the backward glance is characteristic of Thomas's writing, so, too, is the onward step. To take things at walking pace is to take them at their proper, human speed; and this allows Thomas to find in England's roads and woods and hidden haunts a close correspondence between the rhythms of nature and those of common human life and speech. Walking, for him, was essentially a levelling activity; he could delight, De la Mare wrote, in \"a poor man of any sort, down to a king\". That egalitarian impulse is clear in Thomas's concern, shared with his great friend Robert Frost, for the dignity of manual labour. It's clear, too, in an ear that is often wittily attuned to the cadences of unstudied speech: \"Women he liked, did shovel-bearded Bob, / Old Farmer Hayward of the Heath, but he / Loved horses. He himself was like a cob, / And leather-coloured. Also he loved a tree.\" The poem ends by telling us that all that now survives of the farmer is a name: Bob's Lane. This interest in naming, which recurs throughout Thomas's poetry, is picked up here by UA Fanthorpe in a poem of Gloucestershire placenames. These, the \"vocabulary of earth\", are in themselves almost a force of nature: \"No committee okayed them. / They happened, like grass. / ... / Their proper stresses a password / Known only to cautious locals.\" \"Old Man\" is the poem that receives most mentions here, and it's easy to see why, as its insistence on the manifold bewilderments of utterance and reference give it a strikingly contemporary ring. It begins: \"Old Man, or Lad's-love, - in the name there's nothing / To one that knows not Lad's-love, or Old Man, / ... / Even to one that knows it well, the names / Half decorate, half perplex, the thing it is\". It's not just that Thomas is interested in the inner life of words and speech, but that his best poems, as here, enact his inquiries for the reader. Like Frost, he shows great skill in bringing speech or thinking to life, whether through a persona or his own clean authorial voice. As ever, his attention to linguistic stagecraft repays the closest scrutiny. Such is his simplicity of diction that the reader is frequently led astray by phrasings that double-back sharply on paradox or secondary meanings. In \"The Word\", for instance, he muses on memory's failings, likening everything he has formerly loved and now forgotten to \"a childless woman's child / And its child's children\", a startling, infinite regress of loss, which prefaces a stripping down of the poet's own perceptions to the most basic sensations - \"the elder scent / That is like food\" or \"the wild rose scent that is like memory\" - and then, finally, to that \"pure thrush word\", the \"empty thingless name\" that, denoting nothing, is yet distilled to a very quintessence of meaning. Glyn Maxwell captures something of this characteristic in the largest contribution here, a series of 14 \"Letters to Edward Thomas\" cast as notes that can never be read by their intended recipient: \"What I write / Is on its way nowhere, is less than breath, / So might be anything, as nothing might.\" He continues, with reference to Thomas's \"Words\": \"Words I mean you not to know / Don't see why they should move in any step / I fix them with.\" As Jem Poster argues in a persuasive essay that locates Thomas within the context of the first stirrings of modernism, this endless, stumbling word-dance lies at the heart of Thomas's work. Edna Longley, our foremost student of Thomas, writes in her introduction to The Annotated Collected Poems that his influence endures because his poetry \"secretes core values, traditions and tricks of the trade\". This edition, generously and skilfully annotated, with what amounts to a mini-essay on each of the poems, is an invaluable addition to Thomas scholarship. Both these books form a fitting tribute to a body of work whose pure clarity of utterance, 91 years after the death of its begetter, still pulses with feeling, thoughtful life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
