Ouaddou finalised his move from the French Second Division side Nancy after impressing Fulham's manager Jean Tigana in pre-season training. The 22-year-old defender put pen to paper on the deal and immediately stated his desire to compete for major honours at Craven Cottage. \"I'm glad everything has been sorted out,\" he said. \"I've signed for four years and hopefully in that time we can win the Premiership.\" Tigana's Fulham revolution gathered pace earlier this week when the Holland international goalkeeper Van der Sar agreed to join in a club record \u00a37m transfer from Juventus. Tigana is also believed to be interested in the Holland winger Boudewijn Zenden, who is on the verge of leaving Barcelona. Chelsea, though, are expected to challenge for his signature. Sammy McIlroy is set to be offered a new two-year deal next week to carry on as the Northern Ireland manager. Swindon, who narrowly avoided relegation from the Second Division last season, have announced that they plan to part company with their manager Andy King. King took over at the County Ground only nine months ago, but under his leadership the club managed only 12 wins from 40 games as they scraped to a 20th-place finish, avoiding the drop by a single point. The chief executive Peter Rowe said in a statement: \"I can confirm that Swindon Town FC have today stated they wish to part company with manager Andy King.\" King's departure could open the way for the former Liverpool manager Roy Evans and Neil Ruddock to become Swindon's new managerial team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
