We all know that this flavoursome confection is a TV show, that the kitchen featured isn't her kitchen, that she isn't really having friends round for a light supper and hasn't prepared a thing! (That's her exclamation mark). And yet Nigella seems to believe in this imaginary world, persevering with the pretence - even allowing us into her \"bedroom\" for some contrived scene of her awaking from her slumbers. A case of a little too much brandy in the trifle, perhaps? Or are there mind-altering drugs in her maple chicken and ribs in sticky marinade? Visions of the Future 9pm, BBC4 As someone for whom physics was incomprehensible, quantum theory is completely bewildering. Apparently, in the quantum world, matter can be in an infinite number of places at once. Like, how? Dr Michio Kaku, accompanied only by his fondness for rhetorical flourishes, embarks on yet another wide-eyed survey of potential futures. So he discusses teleportation, cloaks of invisibility and the possibility of limitless clean energy. Sci-fi becomes sci-fact. Night of 100 Ukes 9.55pm, Current TV Ukeleles are not, it is fair to say, the most credible of instruments. Even the word is funny. But it is, perhaps, this lack of credibility that gives the ukelele its charm, and appeals to those of a quirky bent. It's certainly not its sound. Leaving aside the annoying noise, this story of how a disparate bunch of ukelele players went from strumming at local fetes to playing together in a band on the main stage of Bestival in front of 30,000 people is charming indeed. Exodus 10pm, Channel 4 Any film by Penny Woolcock is worthy of attention, and her dystopian reimagining of the story of Exodus is arresting. Relocating the fable to Margate in the future, where xenophobic politician Pharaoh Mann spreads fear and loathing while his adopted son, Moses, is drawn to the downtrodden, Woolcock's production doesn't always work, but it's nevertheless compelling. It's also quite beautiful, with even a dilapidated fairground possessing a grim splendour. And like the most powerful speculative fiction - Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale springs to mind - it's all about here and now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
