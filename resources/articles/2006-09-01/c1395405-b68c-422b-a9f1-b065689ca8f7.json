As he joked wrily last week after he had been forced into confirming that he would be gone by this time next year, neither he nor his audience will mourn the occasion. If the ambitious dreams of the ultra-modernisers to end for ever the link between the industrial and political wings of the Labour movement have withered, Mr Blair has entirely kept the promise he made to a strike-weary electorate all those years ago, that there would be no special favours for the unions. Yet, by one of those curious ironies of history, trade unionists suddenly seem in reach of more real power than they have had in a generation. For the first time since Margaret Thatcher came to power, decades when unemployment and hostile legislation has corroded their support, it seems they might once again be able to whisper into the ear of power. It is not just the smell of gunpowder as public sector workers vote for their first national strike in 18 years in protest at NHS privatisation, nor the blistering attack on the government's record from the TUC general secretary, the normally mild-mannered Brendan Barber. For sometime in the coming months, ordinary rank-and-file trade union members who pay the political levy - estimated at about a third of the total 6.7 million members of TUC-affiliated trade unionists - will have a voice in deciding who will be the next prime minister. The history of Labour's electoral college has not always been edifying: in 1994 Tony Blair won only a tiny handful of trade union nominations but he (just) captured a majority of the vote among trade unionists. It was the electoral college that was at the heart of the disgraced campaign to insert Alun Michael as leader of the Welsh assembly, and it was used even more shamefully in 2000 as a piece of blatant electoral chicanery to ensure that Ken Livingstone was not chosen as the official Labour candidate in the first election for London mayor, an episode whose only benefit was that it provoked further reform. (Individual members' choices are now always reflected in the way the union casts its final vote.) Yet in these days of dismal turnouts and political apathy this once embarassing legacy of early 1980s militancy, begins to look like a brilliant stroke of democratic creativity. For the electoral college means that not only will MPs and MEPs choose the party leader, so will 200,000 party members and perhaps as many as 2.5 million of those levy-paying trade unionists - core Labour supporters, a genuinely pluralist exercise that, if imperfectly, resembles a US primary. And for the first time in British history - as long as there is a contest rather than a coronation - a serving prime minister will be elected by a group other than elected members of parliament. Now as Gordon Brown prepares to pay court to them at a private dinnner tonight, trade union leaders and members must consider how to use this revived power. A long shopping list, not comfortable reading for a chancellor committed to a flexible workforce, has been well-rehearsed. It includes an end to the privatisation of public services, the introduction of collective bargaining rights over pensions and training, and an increase in the minimum wage. Individual trade unions are already making plans for hustings for the candidates. Trade unions need some victories. As Mr Barber pointed out yesterday, in a buoyant economy it is not good enough just to hold membership steady. But outside the public sector and the old nationalised industries, too many workers see no point in joining a union. Once, its obligations to undemocratic trade union power, the beer and sandwiches and deals in smoke-filled rooms, made Labour unelectable. Now, open and transparent, it might just offer a way of liberating politics from the air-conditioned offices of Whitehall - and revive one of those voluntary institutions Mr Brown so admires."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
