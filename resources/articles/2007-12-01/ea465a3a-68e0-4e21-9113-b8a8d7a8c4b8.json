Sadiq Elhaj is one of the richest men in Britain - and one of those with the lowest profile. The Observer has learnt that his 26-year-old son has been missing inside the United Arab Emirates for more than two months. A power broker in his native Sudan, Elhaj has been helping with behind-the-scenes talks with some of the rebel groups in Darfur and has put \u00a315m into the Klaimendo Project, an ambitious programme to help 40,000 people in the north of the war-torn region. But Elhaj has also been fighting a secret battle to find his only son, Alsadiq Abdullah, missing since 23 September. No ransom demand has been made and the case is baffling Elhaj's lawyers. Alsadiq was last seen disembarking from a plane in the United Arab Emirates. His father has since had a series of phone calls from his son in which he begs him to travel to the UAE and voices can be heard instructing him what to say. Elhaj, who made his billions in property and banking, believes that corrupt UAE officials handed Alsadiq over to kidnappers. The last call from Alsadiq, on 5 November, convinced Elhaj that his son is being held by business rivals in Abu Dhabi. Elhaj believes his son was forced to make the calls begging him to fly out to the UAE to help him sort out a business deal. Warrants - the legality of which are disputed by the UAE's attorney general - exist for the arrest of Elhaj and his son. Elhaj was tried in absentia last year and sentenced to a year's imprisonment in the UAE for fraud surrounding an \u00a380,000 business deal in Abu Dhabi. Elhaj claims the allegations are without foundation and says he suspects his son is being held as a ruse to draw him into the UAE so that he will be imprisoned. 'Members of the family received calls and we soon received confirmation that something was wrong from the nature of the calls,' Elhaj states in a sworn testimony given to his lawyers. 'It was only when Mr Potter (Elhaj's business associate) received a text from Alsadiq telling him he had been kidnapped, combined with all the other weird conversations he had with other members of the family, that we became seriously worried.' Elhaj's lawyers are trying to get Alsadiq's records from his mobile phone company in the hope they can help pinpoint his position. Elhaj believes a former business associate, who has been implicated in the assassination of a mutual colleague, is behind the kidnap plot. 'The idea that I would enter a business deal for \u00a380,000 to build a brick factory is preposterous,' Elhaj claims in the documents filed with his lawyers. 'Quite honestly, billionaires don't need to travel to the UAE to set up a brick factory for \u00a380,000, let alone then commit a crime to make that sum of money.' The kidnapping is taking its toll on Elhaj's family, who are becoming increasingly concerned for Alsadiq's safety, according to their lawyer, Jason McCue, of human rights law firm H2O. 'We need to sort this out so that Elhaj can go back to helping with negotiations to bring peace to Darfur,' McCue said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
