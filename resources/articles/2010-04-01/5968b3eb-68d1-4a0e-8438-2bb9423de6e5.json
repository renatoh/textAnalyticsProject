So lovely, yet unloved \u2013 by me at least, and by almost anyone else who endured soggy, mushy, watery cauliflower cheese doled out in the school dinner hall during their formative years. It came second only to cabbage in the malodorous canteen hall of vegetable shame. On top of that, it looked like brains, and not in a good way. But times change, and palates do, too. I'm here to tell you that, today, I'm a cauliflower lover. Far from looking like the anaemic contents of an unhappy head, I now see it as the palely beautiful, arrested flower bud that it is. I like it lightly steamed and served with garlicky a\u00efoli and anchovies as an antipasto, and I like it roasted and added to pasta with toasted pine nuts and raisins, and I like it in piccalilli\u2026 In fact, so far have I come that I even like it in its raw, near-naked state, sliced very thinly on a mandolin and dressed with mustardy vinaigrette; cauli carpaccio, if you will. And guess what? I've even found a place in my heart for a good cauliflower cheese. Lightly cook the cauliflower so it's still got some bite. Drain, let it steam off a bit, then, while it's still very hot, pour over a really good, hot, cheesy b\u00e9chamel and flash it quickly under a scorching-hot grill until it's bubbling and slightly blackened. Or, for a quick hit, just trickle some melted butter over the lightly cooked cauli, sprinkle it with grated Parmesan and grill. So keen am I, I even grow cauliflower these days, assiduously guarding it from the slugs and snails that seem so keen on sharing the feast. I've found it best to plant in autumn, so it's ready to harvest about now. Planting in spring and attempting to keep them going through summer requires lots of tending and watering to produce a good crop and prevent bolting. At River Cottage, we grow All Year Round, a good-sized white variety, and Purple Cape, a deep amethyst-hued globe, and this year we're trying our hand at glamorous Romanesco, the cauli that looks as if it was designed by Vivienne Westwood, with its sculptural, swirling, lime-green whorls. I'm proud to say I've conquered my demons. The cauli is not quite my lotus flower, but it certainly gives me pleasure. If you still harbour any doubts, if childhood memories of the lingering whiff of watery, insipid mush still persist, try today's recipes. I think they'll convert you, too. Cheese cauliflower This recipe, created by Tim Maddams, head chef at the River Cottage Canteen in Axminster, represents my road to Damascus cauliflower moment. I like to use for this a Cornish brie that's not too ripe. Serves two as a starter. 1 small cauliflower Semi-skimmed milk (enough to cover the cauliflower while cooking) 1 bay leaf 1 clove Salt and freshly ground black pepper For the cheese 1-1.5 litres sunflower oil, for deep frying 200g soft cheese, such as camembert or brie, cut into bite-sized pieces or wedges Plain flour, for coating 2 eggs, lightly whisked 2-3 handfuls fresh breadcrumbs, for coating Divide the cauliflower into florets. Cut any green bits from the stems, but chop up the stalk and stems to use in the dish, too, because they will give a stronger flavour. Put the pieces of cauliflower into a saucepan and add enough milk just to cover. Add the bay leaf and clove, and bring to a gentle simmer. When the pieces of cauliflower are tender, remove the clove and bay leaf, and blitz the cauliflower and milk in a food processor until you have a smooth pur\u00e9e; season to taste. Pour the oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan to a depth of at least 15cm, and heat \u2013 it's hot enough when a cooking thermometer reads 180C or when a cube of white bread dropped into the oil turns golden brown in a minute. While the fat is heating up, coat each piece of cheese in flour, knock off the excess, roll in the egg until covered, then roll in the breadcrumbs until well coated. Repeat the egg-and-breadcrumb stage once more for a double coating, so the cheese is completely sealed. Fry until lightly golden all over. Serve with the warm cauliflower pur\u00e9e. Roasted cauliflower This makes a great nibble to go with drinks \u2013 its smoky, caramelised flavour has been known to win over even the most cauliflower-sceptical. It's also great on the barbecue (just make sure the florets are slightly larger than they are for the oven roasting method). Serves four as a nibble to go with drinks. 1 cauliflower 2 lemons Flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tbsp olive oil \u00bd tsp smoked paprika Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Cut the cauliflower into medium-sized florets, rinse and let some of the water remain clinging to the florets. Put them in a bowl, squeeze over the juice from one of the lemons, and season well. Put the florets on a baking sheet and toss them with olive oil and more salt and pepper. Dust on the paprika, cut the remaining lemon into six segments and scatter these in the tin. Bake for 25-30 minutes, turning once, until slightly caramelised at the edges. Squeeze over the juice from the roasted lemon segments and serve at once, scattered with a little flaky sea salt. Quick cauliflower curry This makes for a light, easy and tasty dinner with some rice and naan or chapattis. Serves four. 2 tbsp groundnut oil 2 small onions, peeled, halved and finely sliced 3 cloves garlic 1 green chilli, seeds and membrane removed, chopped 3cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tsp garam masala \u00bd tsp mustard seeds \u00bd tsp ground cumin \u00bc tsp turmeric 3 cardamom pods, bashed 350g small potatoes, quartered 1 cauliflower, trimmed and broken into large florets 250g whole milk yoghurt 1\u00bd tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e 1 small handful fresh coriander, tough stalks removed 1 small handful cashews or pistachios, toasted Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat, then fry the onion until just golden. While the onion is cooking, pound the garlic, chilli and ginger with a pinch of salt until they form a paste. Add this to the pan and stir for a couple of minutes. Tip in the rest of the spices and stir until the mustard seeds begin to pop. Add the potatoes and cauliflower, and fry, stirring frequently, for five minutes, so that the veg are well coated with the spice mixture. Pour in about 400ml water, bring to a simmer, cover and cook for 10-12 minutes, until the vegetables are tender. In a bowl, whisk together the yoghurt, tomato pur\u00e9e and some of the hot cooking liquid. Remove the curry from the heat, stir in the yoghurt mixture, return the pan to the heat and warm through very gently. Stir in most of the coriander, adjust the seasoning and serve scattered with the remaining coriander and the toasted nuts. \u2022 For the latest news from River Cottage HQ, go to rivercottage.net"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
