The country's market fell by 15% overnight as the Bank of Thailand and the finance ministry announced currency controls to curb the strength of the baht currency. The baht had reached a nine and a half year high before the bank's move. To nervous investors, this all evoked memories of the Asian crisis of 1997. A later move by the Thai authorities to remove the restrictions as far as stock market investments are concerned only caused more confusion. Mike Hanbury-Williams, Head of Pacific Equities at F&amp;C Asset Management, said: \"The decision to withdraw the restrictions provides some comfort for international equity investors. However, it is unsettling to see policy introduced and amended within such a time frame. \"We are not in favour of restrictions on the free flow of capital and remain concerned that the move heralded a more protectionist policy stance by the new government.\" One trader said: \"This Thai news has taken a bit of the edge off the UK market. Investors don't like the idea of money control. Volumes are fairly thin in the run-up to Christmas, so an event like this means shares get marked down sharply.\" So by the close the FTSE 100 index was down 43.5 points to 6203.9. Wall Street was no help, opening lower after the sharpest rise in US producer prices for 32 years and disappointing results from technology company Oracle. In London British Gas owner Centrica was a stand out feature. It rose 7p to 352.25p on vague takeover talk, possibly prompted by Monday's oil and gas merger between Norway's Statoil and Norsk Hydro. In the past Centrica has been tipped as a target for Gazprom in Russia. Dealers also pointed out that WestLB and Credit Suisse had issued upbeat notes on the company this week. AstraZeneca slumped 126p to \u00a327.38 after the European Patent Office said it had revoked a patent on the company's bestselling heartburn and anti-ulcerant pill Nexium. The patent was not due to expire until 2014, though it still appears to be protected from generic competition until 2010 by data exclusivity rules. Mining companies were weaker on lower commodity prices, with Vedanta Resources down 24p to \u00a311.99 and Kazakhmys falling 31p to \u00a311.38. BHP Billiton lost 13.5p to 927.5p, despite reports that Xstrata and Rio Tinto were separately in talks to buy its South African Optimum mine. Xstrata was 24p lower at \u00a325.06 while Rio closed down 29p at \u00a327.63. Cairn Energy, which has been under pressure recently after a disappointing flotation of its Indian operations, fell a further 41p to \u00a318.20. Analysts at UBS today cut their price target on the company from \u00a324.50 to \u00a323.30. BT lost a further 7.75p to 305.25p on worries about its \u00a33.4bn pension deficit, while power station owner Drax fell 11p to 809.5p after Lehman Brothers cut its target price from 880p to 790p. Soft drinks group Britvic jumped 18p to 281p. After the market closed, private equity group Permira confirmed that it had bought a 13.98% stake for 280p a share, prompting talk that a bid was in the offing. The sellers were believed to be a range of institutions. It had been suggested that investment group Axa had sold all its stake but Axa said yesterday it retained a 9.11% holding. Shore Capital analysts said they would not rule out a bid, but Britvic's long term marketing and bottling agreements with Pepsi - which owns 5% of Britvic - contain a change of ownership clause. This could prove a stumbling block in any deal. In any case Permira said in October, in response to speculation at the time, that it would not make a bid for six months without board agreement or unless another offer emerged. On the trading front, energy group John Wood added 14.75p to 259p after it said it expected full-year results to be ahead of market expectations, thanks to increased demand for its services from oil companies. Burren Energy was down 9.5p to 902.5p, which said a test well in Congo-Brazzaville had failed to strike oil and would be suspended. \"This result is obviously disappointing,\" said Bridgewell analyst Nathan Piper. \"It has wider implications, increasing the risk associated with the remaining three well exploration drilling campaigns in southern Congo.\" Bridgewell has an underweight recommendation on the shares. Business Post lost 17.5p to 444.5p after FedEx Corporation terminated its contract with the company for parcel services in Britain. The move followed FedEx buying ANC for \u00a3120m. \"We do not expect any impact on profits for this financial year,\" said Business Post. \"Once the nature and timing of the contract exit has been agreed, we will give guidance on the profit impact for future years.\" Altium Securities cut its rating from hold to reduce, saying Business Post had itself been tipped as a takeover target, but the list of potential buyers was now looking very short. Finally, today sees the Aim debut of mining company Petmin. It is placing shares at 9p each to raise \u00a33.6m and is likely to be valued at around \u00a343m. Healthy prognosis Keep an eye on the medical group Deltex, up 0.5p to 17.25p yesterday. The British Journal of Surgery has just published, for the first time, the results of a trial of the company's CardioQ monitor, which measures blood flowing round the body during surgery. The trial, with the Medway Maritime NHS trust, showed that by reducing complications arising from operations, use of the monitor cut the number of days that patients needed to stay in hospital by up to 40%. The CardioQ system consists of hardware costing several thousand pounds and non-reusable probes priced at about \u00a350 each. Deltex claims the use of the system not only benefits patients, who go home earlier, but saves the hospital money. Company followers say more news will follow soon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
