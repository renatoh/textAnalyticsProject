There was a close encounter at turn 19 in Q2 between Verstappen and Hamilton, who had engaged in a war of words via the media after their collision at the start of the Mexico Grand Prix last week, with Hamilton complaining of the threat of being \u201ctorpedoed\u201d by the aggressive style of the Red Bull driver and Verstappen accusing him of being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d. Verstappen was forced on to the grass as he tried to pass Hamilton, who was himself seeking to overtake the Toro Rosso of Daniil Kvyat. Stewards decided the incident was not worthy of investigation, though there was a hint of disdain when Verstappen was asked about it. \u201cWe were all lining up to do our lap, to get to the last corner,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were slowing down to make space and Lewis just drove by like nobody was there and didn\u2019t care and I said, \u2018well, if you don\u2019t care I don\u2019t care, I\u2019ll get my position back\u2019,\u201d he added, admitting that it was \u201ca close call\u201d. Hamilton downplayed the moment. \u201cJust nothing, nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no rules and regulations that say you have to stay in single file. I kept going and then he started to try and race me.\u201d Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes teammate, Valtteri Bottas, secured pole on Saturday with a lap time of 1.32.029, just ahead of Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel and Verstappen. This season\u2019s poles leader, Charles Leclerc, was fourth. He had to change to a used engine after an oil leak in his Ferrari in the third practice session. Hamilton was 0.292 seconds slower than Bottas. The Finn is the only driver who can still deny Hamilton his sixth drivers\u2019 championship, though the gap is so vast with only three races left that it would take a miracle to catch him. Bottas would have to win Sunday\u2019s race, with Hamilton finishing outside the top eight, to keep the championship mathematically alive. \u201cFrom what I know of him, he\u2019s going to be there fighting hard. He always wants to win like all of us. He\u2019s leading the championship with a big margin, he doesn\u2019t need many points. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d like to win the championship in a nice way,\u201d Bottas said. \u201cI\u2019ll try to delay that.\u201d Hamilton complained about the track on Friday, saying it made him feel ill during the first practice session and he had to have a lie down to recover. \u201cIt was the bumpiest track by far that I have ever been on \u2013 I had such a headache,\u201d he said. The 34-year-old had secured pole in the past three races in Austin, where he routinely dominates. But his most recent pole this season came at the German Grand Prix in July. \u201cNothing to do with the car, just me,\u201d Hamilton told Sky F1. \u201cI just didn\u2019t pull the laps out together today and clearly the car had the capability to be on the front row and I just didn\u2019t do it today. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d Another Briton, though, had cause to feel satisfied with his day\u2019s work. Lando Norris, 19, who is 12th in the standings in his rookie Formula One season, was fastest in Q1 in his McLaren and ultimately qualified in eighth, one place behind his teammate, Carlos Sainz Jr. Zak Brown, McLaren\u2019s chief executive, is optimistic that the rule changes announced last Thursday that will come into effect in the 2021 season will make his team more competitive as they seek to close the gap on the big three of Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull. Technical alterations should slow cars by around three seconds per lap, race weekends will be condensed from four days to three and there will be a budget cap of $175m (about \u00a3135m per team per year (assuming a 21-race calendar). \u201cI think it\u2019s great we\u2019ve got clarity now on \u201921, I think it\u2019s exciting, we\u2019re going to run at the budget cap,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe are, and the shareholders are, committed to getting back to winning world championships.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
