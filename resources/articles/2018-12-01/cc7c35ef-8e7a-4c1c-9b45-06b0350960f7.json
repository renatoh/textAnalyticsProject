The Ramsay Centre announced on Sunday that it had finally found a suitor for its controversial western civilisation degree, announcing a $50m deal with the University of Wollongong. The centre, which is funded through a bequest from the late healthcare magnate Paul Ramsay, announced the deal to bankroll the new degree for the next eight years. The degree will, according to the university, include a \u201cdetailed examination of the classic intellectual and artistic masterpieces of the western tradition\u201d. The $50m will fund about 150 scholarships and 10 academics. The first 30 Ramsay-funded students will begin the three-year degree in early 2020 and receive a scholarship of at least $27,000. Students will need an Atar score of 95 to be admitted. Unlike the University of Sydney, which has been engaged a public debate with its staff over whether to accept Ramsay Centre funding, the degree will retain the term \u201ccivilisation\u201d and be a full degree rather than a major. Wollongong managed to avoid the same consternation by keeping the impending deal a secret until it was formally signed at the end of last week. Guardian Australia understands news of the deal came as a shock to many within the university\u2019s humanities department. In a statement on Monday a university spokesman that a \u201csmall team\u201d had been established to \u201cquietly\u201d work through \u201call matters related to academic freedom, governance and autonomy from the outset\u201d. However the university spokesman confirmed the Ramsay Centre would have \u201crepresentatives\u201d on selection committees. \u201cRamsay will have representatives on selection committees alongside UOW members, but they will not chair the committees, will not have a majority and nor will they have any overriding deciding vote,\u201d he said. The spokesman said the curriculum for the course had been designed by the university\u2019s academics, but \u201crefined in consultation with Ramsay Centre\u201d. And while the university said Ramsay Centre staff \u201cwill not be sitting in on classes for the purposes of assessing teaching content or quality\u201d the university would provide regular \u201cquality assurance\u201d reports to the Ramsay Centre. The spokesman also said Ramsay Centre staff would be invited to \u201cvisit to observe activities, see the facilities they are funding and attend social functions\u201d. \u201cThe Bachelor of Arts (Western Civilisation) will focus on providing a first-class, philosophically focused, liberal arts education,\u201d the university spokesman said. \u201cStudents will engage directly with great literary, artistic and intellectual works that are cornerstones of western civilisation. \u201cThe program and teaching methods will challenge students to think critically about the material they encounter throughout their studies. All students will be encouraged to reflect upon and give reasons for holding the particular perspectives they choose to adopt. \u201cThis degree is designed to teach students how to think, not what to think.\u201d He said by recruiting academics \u201cspecifically to deliver this program\u201d there would be \u201cno impact on academic freedom by staff being asked to teach this program against personal objections; and no impact on other existing programs or courses\u201d. The announcement comes after months of protracted, at-times heated debate with both Sydney University and the Australian National University over whether to accept the degree. In June ANU pulled out of negotiations owing to concerns about academic freedom. The University of Sydney sent an updated memorandum of understanding to the Ramsay Centre board in October but has yet to formally announce an agreement. The MOU, if accepted, would see the term \u201ccivilisation\u201d dropped from the course and deny Ramsay Centre staff of voting rights on academic and scholarship selection committees. The course would also have to comply within the university\u2019s plan to push skills such as \u201ccultural competence\u201d. It came after strong internal opposition to the degree from academic staff, with a number of departments within its arts faculty rejecting the proposal because, they said, it was at odds with the university\u2019s commitment to \u201cdiversity and inclusiveness\u201d. The University of Wollongong\u2019s initial announcement did not include similar detail about the role of the Ramsay Centre\u2019s role in the appointment of staff. The centre\u2019s western civilisation degree was the brainchild of the late Paul Ramsay, a healthcare mogul who established the centre with a $3.3bn bequest. The deal with UoW \u2013 not a members of the group of eight elite Australian universities \u2013 means it will still have funding to establish the degree with at least two other universities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
