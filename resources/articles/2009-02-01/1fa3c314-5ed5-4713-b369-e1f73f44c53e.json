The publisher of the Sacramento Bee, the Miami Herald and 28 other daily newspapers also announced it's developing plans to lop another $100m to $110m from its operating expenses - including, possibly, more layoffs. It also froze its pensions and temporarily halted matching contributions to its 401(k) retirement plan. Sacramento-based McClatchy also revealed that it's in danger of being de-listed from the New York Stock Exchange because its stock price has fallen below $1 in the past few weeks. The results reflected the ongoing struggles in the newspaper industry and the economy in general. McClatchy's diminishing cash flow has made it tougher to pay down its $2.04bn debt, prompting successive rounds of cost cutting. McClatchy said fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations fell to $21.8m, or 26 cents a share. That was below investment analysts' expectations of 30 cents a share, and represented a decline from year-ago earnings of $36.1m, or 44 cents a share. Revenue fell 17.9% from a year earlier, to $470.9m, and advertising sales dropped 20.7%. On a bottom-line basis, the company reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of $21.7m, or 26 cents a share, because of a $59.6m non-cash write-down. The write-down, the third the company has taken since the downturn began, reflects an acknowledgment that its properties aren't worth as much as previously believed. In a statement, chief executive Gary Pruitt said \"2008 was a difficult and disappointing year. We faced troubled economic times and structural changes in our business\". He said 2009 is off to a rough start, with January \"slower than the fourth quarter ... We don't have any better sense than other market observers as to how long the current recession will last and we do not yet have visibility of revenue trends\". All media companies have been badly hurt as retailers struggle and cut back on advertising. Mervyns vanished in December, Circuit City is going out of business and a slew of auto dealers disappeared from the greater Sacramento area. Most major retailers except Wal-Mart reported sharp declines today in January sales. Pruitt called the latest cutbacks - following significant layoffs and other cutbacks last year - \"especially painful in a horrible economy and we have had to make some very difficult decisions to keep the company safe\". Last month McClatchy said it would halt shareholder dividends as of April 1, a move that will save $60m a year. The details of the $100m to $110m in cost cutting weren't released. Last year the company implemented layoffs, buyouts and other measures to trim expenses by $200m annually, and it's likely McClatchy is in for more layoffs. In a letter to Sacramento Bee employees, publisher Cheryl Dell said it's clear some positions will be eliminated, although \"we also are exploring several other alternatives to limit the number of layoffs\". The company said a freeze on executive salaries, which began in 2007, will run through 2009. Pruitt has declined any bonus for last year and this year, and no other senior executives will get bonuses for last year. Rank-and-file employees have been under a one-year wage freeze since last September. For the full year, the company reported profits of $1.4m, or 2 cents a share. Without one-time adjustments, including the latest write-down, the company made $55.4m, or 67 cents a share. In 2007 the company lost $2.74bn, or $33.37 a share, reflecting enormous non-cash write-downs. Without the write-downs, profits came to $110.9m, or $1.35 a share, as revenue fell nearly 16 percent to $2.26bn. With pensions frozen, employees will no longer accrue additional benefits, although the benefits they've earned will remain intact. McClatchy is contacting union leaders at each of its papers to discuss the changes, Pruitt said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
