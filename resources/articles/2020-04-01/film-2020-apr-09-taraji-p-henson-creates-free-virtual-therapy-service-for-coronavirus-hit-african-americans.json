Henson launched the campaign on social media, saying: \u201cThis campaign is for under-served communities experiencing life-changing events related to, or triggered by, the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d Henson added: \u201cIn the African American community, we\u2019ve been taught to tough it out, hide our suffering, but this is something none of us have ever experienced, and no one should suffer in silence.\u201d Henson is operating the campaign through the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation, which she founded in 2018 and named after her late father who, according to the website, \u201csuffered with mental health challenges as a result of his tour of duty in the Vietnam war\u201d. The campaign states: \u201cIndividuals with life-changing stressors and anxiety related to the coronavirus will have the cost for up to five individual sessions defrayed on a first-come, first-serve basis.\u201d Henson is also appealing for donations to defray the cost. According to reports, coronavirus is disproportionately affecting African Americans in the US, with Kristen Clarke, committee president and executive director of Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law calling it \u201ca social, economic and racial justice issue\u201d. It is a similar picture in the UK, with research suggesting that BAME groups are being hit harder in the pandemic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
