We join Sarah Lund as the veteran Copenhagen detective prepares to receive an award for 25 years service with the Danish Police Force. Lund is viewing the presentation as an opportunity for promotion and the start of a new phase in her career - in tactical crime analysis. With luck she may also be able to contrive some kind of reconciliation with her estranged son, Mark. Denmark is buckling under an economic crisis and the incumbent centre-right prime minister, Kristian Kamper, faced with a looming election, needs both to win public support and form a strategic alliance with Centre Party leader, Rosa Lebech. Kamper has already forged an \u201cintimate personal alliance\u201d with Ms Lebech, much to the frustration of his brother - and chief tactician \u2013 Kristoffer, and his aggressively pragmatic PA, Karen Nebel. And he also must attempt to achieve a pivotal understanding with billionaire business tycoon, Robert Zeuthen head of the multinational shipping and oil conglomerate, Zeeland. Zeuthen is weighing up his company\u2019s options; his board urging him to move jobs offshore in an effort to maximize profits, minimize tax and secure future prosperity \u2013 political quicksand for the PM. Zeeland\u2019s influence in the election scenario is crucial. The Zeuthens are an old money dynasty with A-list status yet Robert feels obliged to consider his obligations to the nation rather than simply the destiny of the family enterprise. But his inclination to demonstrate a patriotic conscience is at odds with the more venal concerns of his headkicking MD, Kornerstrup. Zeuthen must further consider his immediate family \u2013 principally his two children, Emilia and Carl - whose custody he shares with recently divorced wife, Maja. This personal political situation, involving far more subtle loyalties, requires gentler tact yet an equally firm hand. The discovery of a dismembered corpse at a dockyard scrap metal yard is Lund\u2019s entry to this Big Picture intrigue and cross traction begins when her investigation into the man\u2019s murder uncovers a suspicious link with Zeeland\u2019s corporate and private security systems. It ratchets up almost immediately when nine year-old Emilia is kidnapped from the family compound and held to ransom by a cunning, techno-savvy individual seeking repayment of a \u201cdebt' from Zeuthen. This sociopath appears to be cut from the same fabric as the deranged Truth Terrorist who confronted Saga Noren in The Bridge. The story\u2019s dramatic gears turn smoothly as the plot proceeds in 24-hour instalments \u2013 one day per episode - bringing pace and exponential tension to its interlocking themes. Lund finds herself juggling two men \u2013 a former police academy boyfriend, Mathias Borch, who turns up as a Special Branch agent - and rookie detective, Asbjorn Juncker, whose zeal and intuition reflect the procedural meticulousness she appears to be struggling to maintain. The mood and the visual style of the series is again informed by intelligence and a sense that the creative team who made it accept their audience doesn\u2019t have to be spoonfed. It may well be flattering for these Scandi dramas to be re-made in the US and the UK for audiences who can\u2019t readily accept nuance (or subtitles) but really, what is the point re-treading originality of such quality and integrity when the likelihood is imitation really means dumbing down? There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with re-workings of Die Broen, Wallander, Borgen or Hatufim (Kidnapped) \u2013 Homeland is the gripping American re-hash of the Israeli hit, . But if imitation is just sincere flattery surely the sincerest form of respect would be to demonstrate genuine inspiration from these programs instead of simply re-creating them with a modified sensibility and cliched tropes that add little if anything original. Viewers with a tendency to gorge on multiple instalments may prefer to buy the DVD than commit to 12 weekly episodes but instant gratification is not something available to Lund as she tackles this perplexing case. In some regards, waiting for each chapter as it comes and enjoying the accumulation of clues as the story \u2013 with its red herrings and blue torchlight - unfolds, is the way it was intended to be seen \u2013 and perhaps should be consumed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
