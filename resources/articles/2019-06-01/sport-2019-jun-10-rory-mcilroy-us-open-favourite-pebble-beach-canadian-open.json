McIlroy heads to Pebble Beach, where the third major of 2019 begins on Thursday, having routed the field at the Canadian Open. Weekend rounds of 64 and 61 meant he prevailed in Ontario by seven. He is now, suddenly, the short\u2011priced US Open favourite in many outlets. In his view his second victory of the year \u2013 he also won the Players Championship \u2013 was the more significant. \u201cI think this time it\u2019s more of an affirmation of what I can do when I play with complete freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the Players Championship I sort of had to grind it out. Conditions were tough. You\u2019re hanging on, playing into the right spots and I felt like this week I was free. I trusted myself 100% and I hit the shots when I needed to. \u201cThis victory probably gives me more confidence than the one at the Players, because I played the way I did and I was so free out there, especially given the position I was in. \u201cI think when you get to the US Open setup it can make you play carefully, a little tentatively and try to guide it down the fairways. But if I\u2019ve learned anything this week it\u2019s my game is good enough and swing is good enough, and that I can play with freedom. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hit a driver on every hole but when I pull a club out of the bag I\u2019ll make a really good, committed swing and know for most part it should work out for me.\u201d Pebble Beach and the Canadian Open course in Hamilton have poa annua greens and, McIlroy believes, plenty more in common. \u201cTo be comfortable hitting different clubs off different tees, hitting different shapes, you need to do that. And the rough was pretty penal [in Canada]. It was pretty thick. I\u2019m guessing the rough at Pebble Beach may be a little longer but you needed to hit fairways to give yourself a chance to shoot a low score. \u201cI did that and I think the reason I played so well was the fact I put myself in the fairway for the most part. I\u2019m going to need to do the same again.\u201d McIlroy\u2019s success on his debut in Canada came the week after a missed cut at the Memorial tournament in Ohio. That, he insists, merely illustrates the fine margins in the upper echelons of his sport. \u201cI think that\u2019s the thing that people don\u2019t quite understand with golf at this level,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I made a couple extra birdies on the back nine on Friday I would\u2019ve made the cut and could have produced a weekend like this and won the tournament. You never know. \u201cThat\u2019s why I always say I never try to get too carried away when I\u2019m playing good and I never get too carried away when I\u2019m playing badly. \u201cBoth of those instances are not far away from each other. I think something like this is always around the corner and something like what happened last week, a missed cut, is always around the corner, too. I feel like my consistency this year has been great.\u201d A 16th PGA Tour triumph and cheque for $1.37m meant McIlroy had little cause to be upset with missing out on a final round of 59. When nine under par after 14 holes on Sunday, that target was within view. He bogeyed the last from a greenside bunker when a birdie would have elevated him into rare sub-60 territory. \u201cI was a little nervous over the six\u2011iron going into the last. Last time I had a putt for 59 was at the Bear\u2019s Club where I play in Florida, I think it was the week before the Masters in maybe 2016. I left it short. \u201cIt came into my head when I was hitting the bunker shot, I\u2019m definitely not leaving this short. So I wish it had been a putt for 59 instead of a bunker shot but I gave it a go, I was aggressive, and at least got it to the hole.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
