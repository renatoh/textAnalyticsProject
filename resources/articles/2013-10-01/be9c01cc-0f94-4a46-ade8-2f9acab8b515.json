The shutdown is not a priority for business leaders, said Welch. He did, however, blame the nation's predicament on lawmakers' inability to build relationships, and gave them negotiating tips from his lifetime in business. As that debate approaches, Welch advised that Congress and the president should work on developing a different relationship, one that's cordial, private and developed through \"lots of discussions, lots of give and take\". He added that in contrast, the upcoming debt ceiling debate is \"serious baseball\", and the one that the nation should really worry about. \"I think both sides in Washington deserve a real punch in the nose based on the fact that there is no relationship,\" he told the audience at the World Business Forum in New York. \"The problem, from a leadership standpoint, is when you have got an adversary, you've got to deal with him. You've got to have a relationship, you've got to be personal with him. You've got to work with him, you've got to compromise. You can't call him a terrorist. You can't call him an extortionist. You can't call people you have to negotiate with names in public. It's a bad idea.\" It's unlikely that the lawmakers in DC will heed Welch's advice. On the morning of the shutdown, President Barack Obama repeated his stance that he will not negotiate with a rogue group of Tea Party Republicans over the debt ceiling. In a Rose Garden address, Obama said: \"I will not negotiate over Congress' ability to pay bills it's already racked up.\" Obama warned Congress about following down this path when it comes to debt ceiling, comparing Republicans' unwillingness to raise the debt ceiling to avoiding their car loans. \"You're a deadbeat,\" he said. \"Knock it off. Pass a budget. End this shutdown.\" While speaking at the Brookings Institution last Friday, former vice-president Al Gore said that the only phrase that appropriately described Republicans' risking the possibility of the shutdown was \"political terrorism\". And as the shutdown deadline approached, a number of lawmakers, including senators Dick Durbin and Harry Reid, said that they will not consider various Republican proposals, such as going to conference, \"with a gun to our head\". While Welch dismissed the shutdown's effect on the business world, regulators have sung a different tune. The SEC Chairman, Mary Jo White, and US attorney for Manhattan, Preet Bharara, warned last week that the budget shutdown would mean that their offices cannot properly regulate Wall Street. For example, due to the shutdown, the SEC has ceased: \"investigative work, including commencing investigations and conducting investigative testimony, except as necessary for the protection of property; pursuing the collection of any delinquent debts or work to distribute funds to harmed investors; and non-emergency examinations and inspections and related follow-up.\" Only 4.1% of the staff of another regulator, the US Community Futures Trading Commission, are allowed to work during the shutdown, its workload will also be significantly scaled back. The Department of the Treasury is also in hibernation. Due to the shutdown, \"tax policy development, and regulation would be halted\", stated its shutdown memo. All meetings at the IRS related to audits and collections are canceled and have to be rescheduled. The Financial Crime Enforcement Network will halt most of the Bank Secrecy Act regulatory and foreign and domestic law enforcement. Lastly, this Friday will come and go without the jobs report. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics: \"During the shutdown period BLS will not collect data, issue reports, or respond to public inquiries.\" According to Deutsche Bank economists, all economic data supplied by the government will be delayed. Private sector data, however, and data from the Federal Reserve, will be distributed as usual. That includes measures like consumer sentiment, the ADP employment numbers that are often considered a predictor of the BLS jobs report, and consumer credit reports."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
