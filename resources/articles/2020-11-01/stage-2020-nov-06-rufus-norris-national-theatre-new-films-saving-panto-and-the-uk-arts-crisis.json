It must have been good to have audiences back, albeit briefly, for Death of England: Delroy? It\u2019s been another drop down on the rollercoaster of this whole period. I gave a little speech at the beginning of the show about how it\u2019s fantastic to feel audiences\u2019 hunger for gathering together to hear a story. It\u2019s been very uplifting. This has been a difficult, painful period and the best balm for all the anxiety is to get up and do what we\u2019re here to do. And we\u2019ve got that show now \u2013 it will have a life at some stage. You even managed to film the production during its short run. The popularity of NT at Home affirmed the importance of that. We had planned on filming it later but when we got the lockdown news on Saturday, within half an hour we got on Zoom and said let\u2019s bring forward the filming. Now we\u2019re talking about the most effective way to get it out to as wide an audience as we can. What other plans does the NT have over this month of lockdown? It\u2019s radically different from last time. We\u2019ve got a space that\u2019s ready to go and we know what the shows are that we want to do. We\u2019re hoping lockdown will be lifted at least for a time over Christmas so that the panto that\u2019s in rehearsal [Dick Whittington] can take place. If by any chance the lockdown continues, then we\u2019ll capture it and do something with that recording. The other thing that\u2019s in rehearsal is Romeo and Juliet, which is a film. Will the Romeo and Juliet film look similar to an NT Live production? It\u2019s completely different. The Lyttelton stage is very big and has the same space behind it and at the sides. What that means is if we clear everything out we have a very big space that, to all intents and purposes, can be turned into a film studio. We\u2019re making a film, not capturing a play. It\u2019s very much a new form that we\u2019re discovering by the day. The director, Simon Godwin, is rehearsing it as a cross between how you\u2019d rehearse a play and how you\u2019d rehearse a film. Normally in film-making you don\u2019t get that much rehearsal time, but in this case we\u2019ve got the opportunity to do that \u2026 We\u2019ve got a top director of photography, a script supervisor, a gaffer, a grip and a certain amount of film expertise alongside all the theatre staff. It\u2019s a very interesting meeting point. It\u2019s great to be breaking a bit of new ground. In the spring, you said the National was haemorrhaging money. How do the organisation\u2019s finances look now? In the near term, the absolutely crucial thing is the result of our loan application [as part of the government\u2019s \u00a31.5bn arts rescue fund]. We think we\u2019ll know about that by the middle of the month. If, by any chance, we don\u2019t get that loan we\u2019re in an unthinkable ballpark. If we get close to what we\u2019ve asked for then we\u2019re relatively confident that we can find our way through the next few months. It will stop the haemorrhaging. It\u2019s a loan not a grant \u2013 it\u2019s money we have to pay back. So it\u2019s a tricky balance. We don\u2019t want to ask for too much. As it is, Lisa Burger [executive director of the NT] and I are uneasy about saddling whoever is leading this building in 10 or 12 years\u2019 time with those payments. As an organisation, if we get that vote of confidence from the recovery fund, that\u2019s what a lot of our donors are looking for. They want to see that the money they\u2019re putting into charities is not going down the drain. It\u2019s quite a complex picture. Over the course of this year, do you think the government has gained a clearer idea about the UK theatre ecology? Absolutely. At the beginning we got a loud and clear message from DCMS that as an industry we had to talk in one voice. At first we were like, well, we\u2019ve got subsidised, not for profit, touring companies, commercial, the difference between Slung Low and the National, Sonia Friedman and Bristol Old Vic and English Touring Theatre. How can we possibly talk in one voice? They said you\u2019ve got to learn and we did. The communication within the broader industry is so much better than it ever has been. The lobbying might have appeared haphazard but it was much less so than it looked, and it resulted in a very positive recovery fund \u2013 not for freelancers but for organisations. I would hope in the long term that that cohesion will stay. It\u2019s useful to be reminded that we\u2019re all interdependent \u2013 we\u2019re all in the same game. You must worry about talent draining away from the industry during this crisis. We are entirely dependent on the 70% of the workforce that are freelance and they are out in the cold to a huge degree. What is of great concern is that this will exacerbate the already existing inequality between people who have the wherewithal to survive lean periods, because they have support from elsewhere or have had opportunities when they were younger [and those who don\u2019t]. I\u2019m talking about class and diversity. There have been significant advances, hard fought for, over the last few years and we\u2019re already seeing that going backwards very quickly. An expansion of the criteria around the self-employment income support scheme and freelance support is essential. I\u2019d love to see a reset of that to recognise the long-term impact."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
