He's off to the high seas to become a \"gentleman host\", dancing with widows and divorcees on a cruise ship. The \"hosts\" are not gigolos, as the more cynical of you might believe, but pillars of patent-leather-shoed respectability. And most are considerably older than Carver's 40 years. Dancing Round the Mediterranean (11am, Radio 4) follows Carver as he joins the good ship Boudicca, where he will be fed and lodged in return for dancing twice a day with the female guests. It's not all fun: he must never show favouritism by waltzing off with the same woman twice in a row, and, on theme nights, he has to dress as a cowboy ... And it's the final ghost story from MR James At Christmas (10.45am and repeated, Radio 4). Number 13, starring Julian Rhind-Tutt, is set in a hotel just after Christmas, when a guest becomes intrigued by a door that only he seems to know exists. Whatever lurks behind, it's probably not a broom cupboard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
