The manager revealed that Daniel Levy, the chairman, has been contacted by Defoe's representative to discuss the future of the England international, who wants to play regularly before this summer's European Championship. \"Daniel spoke to his agent who said he is not happy because he wants to play and he has got a few clubs in for him,\" Redknapp said. \"I am sure he has got a few clubs in for him but we are not selling him. He is saying this club wants him and that club wants him \u2013 that is how they make their money. He is not moving anywhere, though. He is on contract here and is a big player for us.\" Regarding Defoe's prospects of being selected for Euro 2012 by Fabio Capello if he is not in the Spurs starting XI, Redknapp said: \"Jermain wants to play in the Euros but so does Rafa [van der Vaart]. He wants to play for Holland so he feels he has to play. I would not consider letting him out on loan.\" Redknapp has suggested that this season could be Tottenham Hotspur's best chance of winning the title after admitting it may be difficult to retain his star players beyond the summer. He said that if Luka Modric or any other of his best performers was offered a lucrative deal they would be tempted to leave, with the manager revealing that Emmanuel Adebayor, who earns \u00a3225,000 a week on loan from Manchester City, should return north in the summer. Redknapp said: \"If someone comes along and offers players a contract that could blow their current one out of the water, it's very difficult. They are not going to say I was born in Croatia [as Modric was] but I have always wanted to play for Tottenham. If someone offers to treble a player's wages, you've got a problem, haven't you? We're not in a position to pay \u00a340m or pay \u00a3200k a week.\" Regarding Adebayor who has scored nine goals in 18 league appearances, Redknapp said: \"He has done well for us. He is on amazing money. The other week, one of the lads said to him that he had not paid his \u00a350 fine for being the worst player in training on a Friday morning. He said: 'Bloody hell, Addy, you are on 200 grand a week and you can't afford to pay a \u00a350 fine.' He replied: 'Don't insult me \u2013 it's 225.' He certainly isn't getting that here.\" Asked if the Togolese international may stay at the club once his loan expires, Redknapp said: \"We have Adebayor till the end of the year, and [will] see how we go.\" Speaking before Spurs rejected a bid for Steven Pienaar from Queens Park Rangers, Redknapp said he does not want to sell in the current window. \"I wouldn't want to let him [Pienaar] go. There is no one here who I'd love to see the back of.\" Everton's Phil Neville claimed earlier in the week that the test for Spurs's championship credentials will come in March when the season reaches its defining point. In response, Redknapp agreed that the campaign's closing part will be difficult. \"It depends what the fixtures are. We've got some hard games: we've got to go away to Man City [in eight days], Liverpool [in February], Arsenal [late February], Chelsea [March],\" he said, with Spurs also facing Manchester United in March. Tottenham entertain Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday conscious that victory would draw them level with City, who do not play until Monday. But Redknapp refused to consider that prospect, saying: \"I can only look to tomorrow, knowing that it's a tough game.\" Redknapp added that he was \"hopeful\" Scott Parker would return from a knee injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
