In Keith's case, though, the Seventies and a good portion of the Eighties may also be a trifle hazy, so dogged was his pursuit of oblivion of one kind or another back then. It's that pursuit, of course, that has helped make Keith the rock legend he is, and upped the ante in the bidding stakes. The elegantly wasted years have already been chronicled extensively in several biographies and in countless cut and paste snapshots of the Rolling Stones, but that has not stopped HarperCollins and Little, Brown going head to head for a book that will be ghost-written by Keith's 'friend', James Fox - alas not the same James Fox who starred in the acid-fuelled Sixties film, Performance, alongside Mick Jagger and Keith's former squeeze, Anita Pallenberg. Now there's a book I'd like to read. Anyone expecting an impressionistic masterpiece a la Bob Dylan's Chronicles, then, will probably be disappointed, though impressionist it will undoubtedly be. There's the drugs, the drug busts, the friends who died from drugs (Brian Jones, Gram Parsons). There's Redlands, Altamont and Toronto, and a cast of characters that includes Spanish Tony (Keef's one-time dealer) and Sir William Rees-Mogg (his unlikely champion) as well as the Ronettes and, lest we forget, the Mounties. There's Sir Mick, and their love-hate relationship, as well as 'Honest' Ron Wood and Charlie Watts, the greatest drummer and sharpest-dressed in rock'n'roll. There's also that long stretch in the middle, though, when Keith, and by extension the Stones, were out to lunch. And, of course, that recent run-in with the coconut tree as well as the confession, since disputed, that he snorted his dad's ashes. How can it fail to be a right rollicking read? What will he call it, though? 'Drugs and Drugs and Rock and Roll'? 'When Did You Last Sniff Your Father?' How about 'No Stone Unturned'? Or, better still, 'No Turn Unstoned'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
