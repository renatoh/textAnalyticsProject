Following suggestions that the music might be axed because of perceived links to colonialism, the BBC said the songs would be played, but in an adapted form without a singer in line with new coronavirus restrictions. Commenting on the move, the BBC\u2019s media and arts correspondent, David Sillito, said: \u201cThe Last Night of the Proms will still have Jerusalem, the national anthem and new orchestral versions of Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory. However, there will be no live audience in the Royal Albert Hall to sing along, and the number of musicians and singers will be reduced and dispersed around the hall because of social distancing. \u201cThe music will, the BBC says, have to be adapted to reflect the new circumstances \u2013 which means there will be no singing of Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory.\u201d He said the orchestra-only arrangement was how the tunes were first performed at the Proms in 1905, adding that it was understood that the songs would return with lyrics when the coronavirus restrictions came to an end. The BBC said in a statement that \u201cdecisions about the Proms are made by the BBC\u201d and that it regretted \u201cthe unjustified personal attacks\u201d on the guest conductor Dalia Stasevska after reports that she saw the locked down event as a perfect moment to bring change. After those views were attributed to Stasevska in the Sunday Times, the Finn faced calls for her to be replaced as conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra for the night. Nigel Farage tweeted: \u201cSo the BBC may drop Rule Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory from the Proms because the Finnish conductor is too woke. Why not drop her instead?\u201d The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, also intervened to say he shared concerns over the potential removal of the two songs, which he described as highlights, and that he had raised them with the BBC. \u201cConfident forward-looking nations don\u2019t erase their history, they add to it,\u201d he said in a tweet. Dowden\u2019s comments came after Downing Street also waded into the row when a spokesman said that on similar issues Boris Johnson has been clear that \u201cwe need to tackle the substance of problems, not the symbols\u201d. Earlier reports had suggested the BBC was discussing whether to drop the anthems in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. The organisers were said to be fearful of a backlash because the songs were said to be associated with colonialism and slavery. Audience members at the annual event at the Royal Albert Hall in London wave union flags while singing Rule, Britannia!, which includes the line \u201cBritons never, never, never shall be slaves.\u201d Stasevska was reported to be among those keen to remove the compositions from the evening\u2019s repertoire. \u201cDalia is a big supporter of Black Lives Matter and thinks a ceremony without an audience is the perfect moment to bring change,\u201d a BBC source told the Sunday Times. With live shows from the Royal Albert Hall kicking off from Friday, reduced orchestra sizes, social distancing and empty halls will make the 2020 Proms a very different experience. Chi-chi Nwanoku, founder of the Chineke! orchestra, the majority of whose musicians are black, Asian and from ethnic minorities, has said she would be mortified if the BBC did not axe Rule, Britannia! Last month, the classical music critic Richard Morrison singled out the anthems for criticism in a column for BBC Music Magazine, suggesting they were \u201ccrudely jingoistic texts\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
