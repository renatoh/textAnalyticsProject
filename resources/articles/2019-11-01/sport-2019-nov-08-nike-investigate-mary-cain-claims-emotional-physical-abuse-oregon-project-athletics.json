The announcement came after Cain received the backing of several former Oregon Project athletes, who said Salazar had also been obsessed with their weight. Another, the Canadian 10,000m runner Cam Levins, issued a public apology on Twitter saying he was sorry he had not looked out for Cain when they were teammates. Cain, who joined the Oregon Project as a 16-year-old, told the New York Times on Thursday that Salazar had demanded she drop her weight to 8st 2lb and that she received no support when she went into a downward spiral that led to her breaking five bones because of osteoporosis and have suicidal thoughts. \u201cInstead I was emotionally and physically abused by a system designed by Alberto and endorsed by Nike,\u201d she said. Salazar, who plans to appeal a four-year ban for anti-doping offences, has denied many of Cain\u2019s claims but has not responded to requests from the Guardian for comment. However, the US athlete Amy Yoder Begley, who ran in the 2008 Olympics, said she was \u201ckicked out\u201d of the Oregon Project after being told she was \u201ctoo fat\u201d and had \u201cthe biggest butt on the start line\u201d after finishing sixth in the 10,000m at the 2011 US championships. \u201cI have first-hand experience with what Mary Cain described,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a lot of respect for her in speaking out. I was older and at the end of my career; I can\u2019t imagine being Mary\u2019s age and going through it alone.\u201d Another former Nike Oregon Project athlete Kara Goucher retweeted a story from her husband, Adam, who said that after the 2011 Boston marathon when she finished fifth in 2:24 only six months after giving birth, \u201cboth Alberto and Darren Treasure went up to my mother-in-law and sister-in-law and said: \u2018Don\u2019t tell Kara but she is still too heavy. She needs to lose her baby weight if she wants to be fast again.\u2019 No celebration on her tremendous run, just judgment on her body.\u201d Levins said he was sorry for not doing more. \u201cYou deserve an apology for not having a person who was looking out for you in the right ways during your time in Portland at the Oregon Project. I wish I had been that person,\u201d he tweeted. Levins added: \u201cI knew our coaching staff was obsessed with your weight loss, emphasising it as if it were the single thing standing in the way of great performances. I knew because they spoke of it openly among other athletes. \u201cYou may not get the apology from those you should but I am sorry as your teammate for what happened. I understand both the arbitrary number goal placed on you and constant push to lose weight. I promise to be part of the culture change you are progressing by sharing your story.\u201d In a statement Nike said it had not heard Cain\u2019s complaints until Thursday: \u201cWe take the allegations extremely seriously and will launch an immediate investigation to hear from former Oregon Project athletes. At Nike we seek to always put the athlete at the centre of everything we do and these allegations are completely inconsistent with our values. \u201cThese are deeply troubling allegations which have not been raised by Mary or her parents before. Mary was seeking to rejoin the Oregon Project and Alberto\u2019s team as recently as April of this year and had not raised these concerns as part of that process.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
