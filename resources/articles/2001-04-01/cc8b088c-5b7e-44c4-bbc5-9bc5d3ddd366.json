With bank and building society savings rates due to fall further following yesterday's quarter-point base rate cut, the FSA is concerned that investors seeking a better deal might be lured into risky products promising high returns. Sir Howard suggested that many people made unrealistic assumptions about the returns to be gained from their investments. Headline inflation was expected to remain at around the government's target rate of 2.5% for the foreseeable future, so consumers must \"adjust their expectations\". \"Savers need to understand that low inflation means lower nominal returns.\" Sir Howard said it was important that consumers were not misled into thinking they could obtain high returns from low-risk investments. He singled out for criticism the new breed of individual savings accounts that invite small investors to put money into hedge funds, traditionally the preserve of the very rich. Two of the regulator's biggest headaches, mortgage endowments and the guaranteed annuity rates which landed Equitable Life in trouble, stemmed from the failure to adjust to lower inflation, he said. Low inflation protected the value of savings even though headline rates of return on investments were falling, Sir Howard said. In the late 1970s savers were receiving 15% on National Savings accounts. But that return had to be set against inflation which was running at 18% in 1980.Today, a return of 4.5% left investors better off in real terms.
