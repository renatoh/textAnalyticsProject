Luckily for them, the two characters inhabit the same body: Bryan Redpath's. The fox/ant may be just 5ft 7in and 12 stone - remarkably small in today's size-obsessed professional game - but no player will have a greater say than the scrum-half who now almost is the Scottish team. Redpath had long been known as Basil, or Baz, a moniker given him by his elder brothers - both rugby players - after the adventures of a certain foxy puppet that young Bryan was so keen to watch on TV. But a new name was triggered by two blows on the head in 2000. The first came just before he left Narbonne: a boot on the forehead that required 11 stitches. Then, in pre-season training at Sale, he took a bang on what he thought - mistakenly - was the very same spot. History has not recorded exactly what he said but everyone remembers it. Redpath recalls that he was 'really pissed off, really angry'. Coach Steve Hampson was so impressed that he promptly called Baz an 'angry ant'. So, a fox and an angry ant: not a bad combination for a Scottish scrum-half, pointing as it does to the canny as well as the feisty. Intriguingly, Hampson says, 'Everything he does is done at 110mph,' while also characterising Redpath as 'a very professional sort of person'. Another Sale man says: 'He's a mechanic - head under the bonnet. A great leader. We've built a team around him.' Again, a compliment that seems to carry a hint of contradiction. How can you lead when your head is under the bonnet? Certainly, Redpath's captaincy credentials have long been recognised. He often captained even when, in the 1990s, he made sporadic appearances as Gary Armstrong's understudy. Recently the reputation has grown mightily, and he would have been confirmed as Scotland's Six Nations leader even if his predecessor, Budge Pountney, had not abdicated. Redpath says he enjoys captaincy, more so now that he has adjusted his approach to it. 'I realised I was putting too much into it. I was too emotional. Now I concentrate on my own job. I'm not trying to do everything out with my own game.' Apologising for a clich\u00e9, I ask if it's a matter of 'leading by example?' It gets an almost testy rebuttal. ' No . You can get carried away by leading by example. It's much better to do your own job, and do it well. At Sale, for example, the players are ambitious, they're desperate to do well, so you want to do your own job well and play for them.' Scotland's coach, Ian McGeechan, puts it into perspective thus: 'Yes, he's feisty, a great competitor. But he's managed to compartmentalise his responsibilities. He can switch from one priority to another, from Bryan Redpath as captain on the field, to Bryan Redpath as a leader of discussion, to Bryan Redpath as scrum-half. He gives strong, clear direction in his own game. He's just very influential and a great role model.' It is interesting that Redpath refers so positively to his time at Sale. Jim Telfer, Scotland's director of coaching, recently lamented another player's 'wasted' years in England, where clubs were 'not interested in making you a better player for Scotland'. But it seems to have been the making of Redpath, who praises a 'more thorough fitness regime' and also highly organised preparation 'with a lot of thought about the opposition's game and our own game'. And his greater strength and fitness seem to have taken his game to a new level and made him - 10 years after his first Scottish cap - not only a fixture at scrum-half but the new Scottish icon. Of course, there is a danger in that of over-reliance on a scrum-half who could very easily be man of the match in every game. But at least his ambitions are tempered by discipline and objectivity. When viewing a personal video clip - one of those showing a player's every pass, tackle, kick and break - he would be the first to see that he has attempted too much, or taken the wrong option. So, when watching himself, what does he look for? What adds up to a good game? 'You look to see how quickly you're on to the ball. Not caught by anyone in getting the pass away. That the service is clean. Defence good. That the ball is used well in a break, the options weighed up well. And overall an impression of \"God, he's everywhere\".' Obvious enough, yet there is a clarity in Redpath's assessment that one suspects may not run through all of Scotland's backs. Indeed, there must be a big question about exactly what Scotland's game is these days. Once it was fast-rucking forwards, rapidly switching the point of attack. Then, the arrival of John Leslie in the centre switched attention to exciting young three-quarters. Now, all hope seems to rely again on a pack of modest size but great character and mobility. Redpath largely agrees with that. 'Alan Tait and Leslie were a class pairing. We don't have that now. The strength is still with the forwards. We need a game plan.' Was the 21-6 win over South Africa in November last year not a step up? 'Yes and no. They didn't score, which was satisfying. We did put them under pressure. But some aspects were not too flash. We must play positive rugby, keep the pressure on, take the right options and capitalise on the pressure.' Bryan Redpath is not the sort of person to talk up Scotland's chances in the Six Nations. Nor is he one to deliberately downplay them. Ask him if he has hopes for his side and he just says: 'Maybe, but we need to find a game plan that suits us.' He points out that Ireland is a tough starter. If Scotland beat them today it will be because of his work; if they lose, despite it.
