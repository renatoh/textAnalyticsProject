The Ballydoyle colt won all seven of his races in 2001, including the Middle Park Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, but was beaten on his three-year-old debut at The Curragh five days ago. The manner of that defeat, by a short-head to the four-year-old filly Rebelline in the seven-furlong Gladness Stakes, persuaded some punters and bookies that sprinting may eventually be Johannesburg's business. However, O'Brien said yesterday that his unbeaten record was lost only because the man in the saddle, Mick Kinane, was looking to take care of him. \"He came there well on the bit and Mick was just trying to save him, a bit like Pat Eddery on El Gran Senor in the Derby,\" the trainer said. \"Then the momentum goes. Mick was playing a blinder but then Rebelline came past him. \"We wanted to find out if he will get 10 furlongs without exposing him. It's very possible that he will go to Kentucky and you could see him cruising going into the last furlong. That's when it will happen - he will either stay cruising or he won't.\" O'Brien is also convinced that Johannesburg's blistering speed has survived the winter intact. \"He's always had unbelievable pace and he's still got it, if not more,\" he said. \"We won't have any faster here over two or three furlongs.\" If Johannesburg does head for Kentucky next month, he will be accompanied by Castle Gandolfo, the winner of a valuable race on the all-weather at Lingfield last weekend. However, Castle Gandolfo would not travel to the race alone. O'Brien won 20 races in Britain last season, including the Derby, the Oaks, the King George and the St Leger, which was enough to make him the first foreign-based champion trainer for 24 years. He finished more than \u00a31m clear of Sir Michael Stoute, and has such strength in depth at Ballydoyle that he could well do so again this year. One good reason to send Johannesburg to Kentucky, he suggested yesterday, was that \"they can't all run in the [2,000] Guineas\". Hawk Wing, who won the Group One National Stakes last season, is expected to be his principal contender for the colts' Classic at Newmarket on May 4. \"It's a dream but if we had a horse for the Triple Crown then Hawk Wing would be it,\" O'Brien said. \"He could do anything and is bred to stay a bit. He broke the track record at the Curragh and we will give him a chance in the Guineas.\" Hawk Wing is also the ante-post favourite for the Derby, but other colts O'Brien is considering for Epsom include High Chaparral who, like Galileo last year, will run in the Ballysax Stakes at Leopardstown on Sunday and then the Derby Trial at the same course. Ballingarry, a recent winner in France, is another who could yet make up into a Derby horse. Fillies are less of a priority at Ballydoyle, where making valuable new stallions for the Coolmore Stud is the main aim, but Quarter Moon, who won the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes last year, is expected to run in the 1,000 Guineas. \"Unusually for a Sadler's Wells, she has lots of pace,\" O'Brien said. \"We will take in the English Guineas to start her off anyway, and I wouldn't rule her out as an Oaks filly though she shows so much pace. She does everything on the bridle but no doubt she will come off it at some stage in the Guineas.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
