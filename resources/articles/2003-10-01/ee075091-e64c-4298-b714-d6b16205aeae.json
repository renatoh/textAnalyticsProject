The inside story of the Today programme?\" \"Nah. Like fuck that shit. My new brand is sex, drugs and rock'n'roll. I'm gonna write this story of like this fat, disillusioned chick who's sitting in the office waiting for someone to fix the window. Elsewhere in the building there's this middle-aged bloke who has, like, just been dumped by his mistress. He thinks about committing suicide, but doesn't really want to, and wanders into the fat chick's office hoping for sympathy. She thinks he's come to mend the window and says, 'There it is. Get on with it.' So he fucking jumps.\" Liddy started cackling. \"Whadya think?\" \"It's a start,\" replied the agent cautiously. Liddy twiddled his tousled hair, stared at his screen and hammered at the keyboard. \"Finished,\" he yelled half an hour later. \"That's rather quick,\" the agent said, suspiciously. \"Must be the drugs,\" smirked Liddy. \"Anyway I've knocked out two more stories. There's this one about a girl who gives a bloke a wank rather than shag him, and the other's about a bloke who gets a blow job from his mother-in-law while his wife's buying an ice cream.\" \"I thought you weren't writing your autobiography,\" said the agent. Liddy returned to his office and by the end of the weekend he had cranked out another 200 pages. \"There's some great shit here,\" he said. \"A bloke who's having an affair and tells his wife he's going to Uttoxeter. And, get this, he's, like, in a train crash and gets his arm ripped off and tries to walk to Uttoxeter. \"Yeah, and then there's the bloke who tries to shag the midwife while his wife's giving birth and whose baby can recite the whole Chelsea team. And then there's these two flies that can talk and this posh bird, whose best friend is turning into a locust, who fucks a Romanian tramp. Her Mum, like, lives in a teepee and then the Romanian turns out to be a war criminal.\" \"Do you think you've lost the plot?\" said his agent, who was by now extremely concerned for Liddy. \"How can you when there isn't one? I've got another story about a schoolkid who kills loads of people and only gets into trouble when he calls some cunt a nigger, and then there's this Arab who becomes a celebrity for being the world's worst terrorist after failing to detonate his suicide bomb, and then ends up on Parky trying to blow himself up again ...\" Liddy paused. \"It's like iconoclastic, man. It's Mart meets Will. I'm the new enfant terrible .\" His agent shook his head. \"Just terrible will do.\" The digested read ... digested The emperor's new clothes unveiled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
