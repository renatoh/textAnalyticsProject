A spectacular strike from Goodwillie \u2013 his 11th goal of the Scottish Premier League season \u2013 came in the fifth minute of stoppage time after the prolonged treatment for the home midfielder Johan Folly, who broke his ankle. A careless error from Keith Watson had gifted the Dons a half-time lead over United in an entertaining clash at Pittodrie. Both sides created chances before the opening goal, with Jamie Langfield called upon to make a superb stop to deny Goodwillie, while Scott Vernon headed over the crossbar from a Paul Hartley free-kick. United created the next opening after 31 minutes when Goodwillie managed to outmuscle the defender Zander Diamond and crossed for Prince Buaben, but the Ghanaian could not divert his downward header past Langfield. The visitors had been enjoying a period of dominance but it was Aberdeen who broke the deadlock after 37 minutes, courtesy of a mistake from Watson. The right-back's back pass was woefully short and Chris Maguire immediately latched on to the loose ball and beat Dusan Pernis before passing the ball into the unguarded net to the delight of the home supporters. The Dons dominated the second period but could not find a second goal to kill off a below-par United, who rarely troubled Langfield in the home goal. With 15 minutes remaining both sides made changes with Josh Magennis replacing Ryan Jack for the Dons, while the Tangerines introduced David Robertson and Stuart Armstrong for Scott Robertson and Barry Douglas. McNamee's solid debut came to a premature end as he limped off with cramp and was substituted for Jerel Ifil. The home side's pursuit of a clinching goal continued with Maguire unlucky to see his well-struck shot blocked by Sean Dillon. And the Dons paid the price for their profligacy when, in the dying stages of injury time, Dillon's cross into the box was headed down by David Robertson for Goodwillie, who volleyed the ball past Langfield to silence the home support. After the match, the Aberdeen manager, Craig Brown, praised his side for having \"plenty of appetite and good forward play\". Brown blamed \"weary legs\" for the dropped points which would have given him maximum points from his first three games in charge at Aberdeen, but said he was pleased with the progress made. Dundee United's manager, Peter Huston, was direct in his assessment of his side's lacklustre performance. \"We gifted them a goal and lacked spark. We were poor and Aberdeen were the better team. I was delighted to see our goal go in.\" Stuart McCall called on his side to improve after he was denied victory in his first game as Motherwell manager but his team ended a three-match losing streak in a goalless Lanarkshire derby draw with Hamilton. McCall's team survived some late first-half pressure from the SPL's bottom club, with Dougie Imrie testing Darren Randolph from long range. But Well began to take control and hit the woodwork after Tomas Cerny failed to hold Jamie Murphy's low cross, although Imrie missed an excellent late chance. Motherwell gradually began to push Accies back and they hit the woodwork in the 71st minute. A Keith Lasley pass took Hamilton left-back David Buchanan out of the game and allowed Jamie Murphy space to fire in a low cross that Cerny palmed on to the crossbar. Stephen Craigan headed the resulting corner just over and Motherwell continued to press but Hamilton almost snatched a winner with two minutes left. Gavin Skelton's quick pass put Imrie clear but he shot wide of the far post from 18 yards. McCall suffered a blow in the final stages when the forward Nick Blackman, on loan from Blackburn, limped off with what looked like a groin injury.
