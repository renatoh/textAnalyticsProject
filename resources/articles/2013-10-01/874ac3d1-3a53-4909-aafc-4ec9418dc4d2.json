Saturday\u2019s Test on the Gold Coast was a totally different story \u2013 the Malawi Queens were level with Australia for nearly 25 minutes and only really fell away in the last quarter, finally losing 37-64. The scoreline only told half the story; Malawi produced an entertaining mix of acrobatic splits, funky flick-shots, deceptive one-hand passing, slippery cross-court plays and headbanded athletes brimming with charisma. Let\u2019s also not forget Malawi is one of the poorest countries in in the world and yet boast the world\u2019s fifth-best netball team. The Queens are officially the most successful sporting team the nation has ever produced. Malawi missing three top players Netball in big news in Malawi, where the word for netball is nchembre mbaye \u2013 \"nchembre\" means \"mother\". But there was nothing motherly about the way the Netball Association of Malawi (NAM) stopped four of its players from touring with this side; shooter Sindi \u2018Sniper\u2019 Simutowe, Beatrice Kadango, Lauren Ngwira and Grace Mhango. All four play for a club called the Tigresses. During a national league match in Malawi, Ngwira was suspended just prior to a Tigresses match after allegedly being found to be pregnant. The team was told they would forfeit the match, but NAM alleges the team refused to the leave the court. The Nyasa Times also published unconfirmed reports that \u201cTigresses players were then involved in a scuffle with some NAM officials up to an extent for the police intervention\u201d. A few weeks later, NAM responded by refusing to let those players trial for the Australia/New Zealand/Fiji tour. In any event, Simutowe, Ngwira and Mhango are big losses for the team. Simutowe is a wonderful goal attack who plays like Mary Waya crossed with Simone Forbes \u2013 both a playmaker and an accurate long-range shooter. The biggest hole was left in Malawi's defence though. Mhango and Ngwira both normally share the goalkeeper bib in the Queens\u2019 starting line-up. Ngwira stands at just over 180cm \u2013 the tallest defender available in the Malawi squad. With a bit of extra height at the back, who knows just how much better Malawi could have been in these Tests. Mwawi Kumwenda had pleaded with NAM officials to allow the three to tour, Ngwira denies being pregnant, Malawi\u2019s sports minister told BNL Times the matter was handed childishly and all four players were later cleared of any misconduct in an investigation by the Malawi National Sports Council. Malawi\u2019s 84-35 goal loss on Wednesday was the Queens' biggest ever loss to the Diamonds \u2013 need we say more? How Africa can save international netball Beyond the top four sides world netball has traditionally been seriously lacking in depth. The rise of Africa is huge news for world netball, I can see another two or three African nations competing with the best in the next years and at least another half-a-dozen filling out the middle rung of world netball rankings. GDP in Africa is steadily increasing, creating a new educated middle class and opportunities for women to make a living from netball. Kumwenda will be suiting out for the Canterbury Tactix in the ANZ Championship next year becoming the first African import in the history of the league. In the last few seasons, netballers from Namibia and Botswana have been playing semi-professional netball in England and Singapore. East Africa is particularly fertile for creating world-class teams, with the fast-growing nations of Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya (along with Malawi) now producing dozens of tall, lean, crafty and supremely athletic netball players. Unfortunately, as the Malawi situation showed, the hopes of African netball could be dashed by dodgy administrators. For instance, Tanzania dominated the Netball Nations Cup in Singapore last year and would be in the top 10 if it weren\u2019t for lack of match-play. But under new management the \u2018Tafia Queens\u2019 have not played a single match since winning the event, possibly costing them a place in the Commonwealth Games. Along with poor administration, lack of money and corporate sponsorship are the other big factors holding African netball back. The Uganda She-Cranes would be ranked in the top eight in the world, but are currently unranked because they have not played enough matches. While the UK Netball Development Trust continues to run extensive skills workshops in Ugandan schools, the She-Cranes have not played a netball match outside of Africa since 1979. In June, Uganda had to travel close to 2,000 km in a hot, old minibus on makeshift mud roads to play in the African Netball Championship because the side couldn\u2019t raise enough money for flights. Nonetheless, the She-Cranes terrorised their opposition, eventually finishing third \u2013 losing only to Malawi and South Africa. Winning against adversity is becoming a theme in African netball: Zimbabwe, despite basic playing conditions, has a new multi-tiered netball super-league which is producing some excellent players. The Zambian team is showing vast improvement with the nation having just set up a youth league with funding from UK Sport. Further afield, and Botswana has recently won the rights to host the 2017 World Youth Netball Championships. South Africa professional netball goal hindered by lack of money Lack of corporate interest is holding back the development of professional netball in South Africa. Netball South Africa is desperately trying to start a 10-team professional league and while there has already been commitment to televise all the matches from its broadcast partner, it is struggling to find businesses who want to put money on the table. It was originally hoped the league would be in operational with full-time paid netballers by April this year, with each team having an import from other African nations. Proteas coach Elize Kotze told the Guardian \u201cthis is still a dream on paper with the hope kicking-off in April 2014\u201d. But sponsorship remains incredibly slow. Since Irene Van Dyk migrated to New Zealand, South Africa has failed to make even the semi-finals of a major world event. \u201cThe difference between the Spar Proteas and the top-three England, New Zealand and Australia is definitely not the potential but the opportunities available to train and play professional in well-established structures,\u201d Kotze told the Guardian. Indeed, with an estimated two million netball players, the sky is the limit for the current world No6. So will South Africa\u2019s netballers prevail or spend another few decades struggling to get the recognition, success and support they deserve?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
