The commercials for the firm MYA, which depicted women dancing and laughing around a swimming pool and on a beach and a boat, were labelled \u201cirresponsible and harmful\u201d by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) on Wednesday. Its report said the adverts glamorised and trivialised such surgery. \u201cWe considered that the ad went beyond presenting the lifestyle of women who had breast enlargement in a positive light and implied that the women were only able to enjoy the aspirational lifestyle shown, and to be happy with their bodies, because they had undergone that surgery,\u201d the watchdog said. \u201cWe also considered that the focus on the aspirational lifestyle and the tone of the ad, in combination with the statement \u2018join them and thousands more\u2019 \u2013 which suggested that it was common to undergo breast enlargement and acted as an explicit call to action \u2013 had the effect of trivialising the decision to undergo that surgery.\u201d The ASA acted after receiving 17 complaints, including one from the Mental Health Foundation. The charity\u2019s director, Isabella Goldie, welcomed the decision as a \u201cwatershed moment for cosmetic surgery advertising\u201d. She said: \u201cThe conclusions of this ruling are a step towards tackling the pressure around body image,\u201d adding that the charity\u2019s research led it to believe that such concerns were \u201cone of the root causes of mental ill health in young people\u201d. She added: \u201cImplying that people can only enjoy body confidence and an aspirational lifestyle by undergoing cosmetic surgery is dangerous and unacceptable.\u201d MYA had argued that the commerical focused on the positive aspects of women\u2019s lifestyles and did not explore the negative attitudes towards their body image before surgery. The firm claimed the ads did not trivialise the decision to undergo surgery, nor did it imply that the only reason the featured women were able to enjoy themselves was because of breast enlargement. After the ruling, it said it would engage with the ASA and a mental health charity before undertaking its next advertising campaign. NHS England\u2019s chief executive, Simon Stevens, backed the ASA\u2019s ruling. \u201cStoking anxiety about body image as a way of selling cosmetic surgery is an additional pressure on young people\u2019s mental health and wellbeing that they \u2013 and the NHS \u2013 can well do without.\u201d Love Island, the reality television show in whichyoung men and women were encouraged to couple up in order to progress towards a cash prize, has been criticised for promoting unhealthy behaviour. In June, a domestic abuse charity said there were \u201cclear warning signs\u201d in the behaviour of one contestant, accusing him of gaslighting \u2013 questioning people\u2019s memory of events to make them doubt themselves \u2013 and emotional abuse ITV has not responded to a request for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
