Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Armed clashes in the north and a likely change of government in Baghdad marked a day of instability and crisis in Iraq. A humanitarian crisis deepened as thousands of members of the Yazidi sect remained trapped in northern mountains despite limited rescue efforts. Iraqi president Fuad Masum, elected last month, officially nominated a new prime minister to replace Nouri al-Maliki, in office since 2006. US president Barack Obama praised the move, saying he spoke by phone with the nominee, Haider al-Abadi, and \u201cpledged my full support.\u201d It appeared the United States had withdrawn all support for Maliki, long touted by the US as Iraq\u2019s indispensable leader. Iran also appeared to have abandoned Maliki. Maliki was not going quietly, appearing on state TV with 30 supporters from parliament to declare the appointment of Abadi unconstitutional. US fighter jets completed four sets of air strikes on Islamic State fighters around Mt Sinjar, currently host to thousands of displaced Iraqis. Obama said the air strikes were to stop the IS advance on Irbil and to protect American citizens there, who include many oil company employees. The United States announced shipments of light arms and ammunition to the militia forces of Iraqi Kurdistan, who are fighting Islamic State militants. Shortly before President Obama spoke about Iraq, US fighter jets finished their fourth strike of the day on Monday, reports Guardian US national security editor Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman). The strikes \u201cbombed and destroyed what the US military called an Islamic State (Isis) checkpoint east of Mt. Sinjar, where thousands of Iraqi Yazidis are under siege,\u201d Spencer writes: Before that, three other strikes from manned fighter aircraft, beginning at 1:10 pm Eastern time, targeted Isis checkpoints to the southwest of the mountain and two other checkpoints to the south and southeast of Sinjar city. US Central Command said they also destroyed an Isis armored personnel carrier and a Humvee that the US very likely provided to Iraqi soldiers who in June abandoned such equipment to Isis. The strike marks the second the US has launched to harass Isis positions around the mountain to break the siege. The first was on Saturday. All other US air strikes have come to the relief of Kurdish forces around the regional capitol of Irbil. A three-star general, William Mayville, told Pentagon reporters on Monday that the US strikes had only a limited and temporary effect on Isis and that the US was not currently contemplating a wider air war. Spencer Ackerman is Guardian US national security editor: As with statements earlier today from the White House and state department, Obama did not mention Maliki, the American partner and Iraqi prime minister for the past eight years, as he described the country\u2019s political future. \u201cI pledged my support to him,\u201d Obama said of Haider al-Abadi, Maliki\u2019s nominal replacement. More from Obama: \u201cThere is no American military solution to the larger crisis in Iraq. The only solution.. is an inclusive governemnt.\u201d \u201cToday Iraq took a promising step forward in this effort,\u201d Obama says, by naming a new prime minister. [It\u2019s] \u201can important step towards forming a new government,\u201d Obama says. He says he joined the call with Biden to Abadi and they urged Abadi to form a new cabinet. \u201cI pledged my support to him,\u201d Obama says of Abadi. Obama is speaking: He says US forces have successfully conducted air strikes to stop the advance on Irbil and protect American citizens there. At the same time the US has continued humanitarian assistance, he says. He thanks the UK, France and others who are cooperating in the aid effort. Aircraft are ready to strike anyone on the mountain who threatens the families, he says. The United States is working to renew ties with Sunni officials in Iraq who \u201chave requested help in organizing grass-roots fighting forces to counter\u201d Islamic State fighters, the Wall Street Journal reports: After a series of smaller rendezvous, U.S. officials met last week with the governors, tribal leaders and other Iraqi politicians in the city of Erbil to discuss recruiting and organizing fighters in four Sunni-dominant provinces where the Islamic State has snatched territory, said several participants. In Washington, officials believe breaking Sunni tribes away from the Islamic State is critical to the long-term security and territorial integrity of Iraq. Some Arab and American officials say the effort is a cornerstone of a developing strategy to confront jihadist threats across the Middle East. But the plan faces hurdles, in no small part because it is haunted by the legacy of a similar past project. Read the full piece here. The US state department has issued a statement on Iraq echoing the White House descriptions earlier today of Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s phone calls with Iraqi leaders. Here\u2019s the state department: The United States welcomes Iraqi President Fuad Masum\u2019s charging of the nominee of the largest bloc in the Council of Representatives, Dr. Haider Al-Abadi, with the formation of a new government. This signifies the successful completion of the third step in Iraq\u2019s constitutionally mandated government formation process, following the election of the Speaker of Parliament and the election of the President of the Republic in July. The United States applauds President Masum\u2019s fulfillment of his constitutional duties and urges the Prime Minister-designate to form a government that is representative of the Iraqi people and inclusive of Iraq\u2019s religious and ethnic identities. The Prime-Minister designate should present the members of his proposed new government to the Council of Representatives consistent with Iraq\u2019s constitutional timeline. The United States will continue to support Iraq\u2019s democratic process and stand with the Iraqi people in their fight against terrorism. Obama will deliver his statement on Iraq from Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts. You can watch listen to it live on the White House web site here. \u201cBeginning shortly,\u201d they say. Update: Audio only, the White House advises. Guardian US national security editor Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) adds to his earlier report on the Pentagon\u2019s warning Monday that while US air strikes have disrupted Islamic State fighters, the group\u2019s power has not been fundamentally diminished: The air strikes, now in their fourth day and still something less than a concerted air campaign, have bought US-backed Kurdish irregular forces, known as Peshmerga, \u201ctime to fortify their defensive positions\u201d outside the regional capital of Irbil, said Lieutenant General William Mayville, Jr., the director of operations for the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Staff, and have slowed Isis\u2019 advance toward the crucial city. Beyond that, said Mayville, who commanded a brigade during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the strikes \u201care unlikely to affect Isil\u2019s overall abilities or its operations in other areas of Iraq and Syria\u201d. Mayville, briefing Pentagon reporters, provided a markedly downcast assessment, notable coming from a military better known over the past 13 years for confidently predicting success in Iraq and Afghanistan. He spoke shortly before Obama was scheduled to issue remarks on Iraq. [...] \u201cThere are no plans to expand the air campaign beyond the current self-defense activities,\u201d said Mayville, who described the Pentagon as \u201cgripped with the immediacy of the crisis\u201d. Read the full piece here. The Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding has written a biographical sketch of Haider al-Abadi, the nominee to be the next Iraqi prime minister. Abadi \u201cis a low-key figure who spent much of his life living in exile in Britain, before returning to Iraq after the 2003 invasion,\u201d Harding writes: Born in Baghdad in 1952, Abadi joined the Islamic Dawa party \u2013 Maliki\u2019s political bloc \u2013 at the age of 15. His father, Jawad al-Abadi, was a prominent Baghdad doctor and hospital director who became inspector general at the Iraqi health ministry. After the Baathists seized power, Abadi and his family came into conflict with the Saddam Hussein regime. Abadi studied electrical engineering in Baghdad, and then in the late 1970s moved to Britain to do a doctorate at Manchester University. In the UK, Abadi became an outspoken Saddam critic and Dawa activist. In 1982 the Baath regime executed two of his brothers, and imprisoned a third for ten years. It cancelled his Iraqi passport in 1983. His father died in exile and was buried in London. Read the full piece here. US President Barack Obama plans to address the situation in Iraq at 4.45pm EDT \u2013 in about an hour \u2013 the White House has announced. The Guardian\u2019s Mona Mahmood (@monamood) has spoken on the phone with Khairi Naif, 55, a Yazidi who says he is stuck on Sinjar mountain with his 10 kids. \u201cI\u2019m on the top of Sinjar mountain with more than 40 member of my family for three days now,\u201d Naif says. We can hardly get a drop of water or a crumb of bread to eat. Our kids are dying from thirst and a shortage of milk and medications. We do not have a single blanket to wrap up the kids with at night. We are sleeping on the rocks and crushing the leaves of the trees to get some water to wash for prayers. We have been hearing of humanitarian aid that would be dropped on us by the US and British planes for the last two days, but up till the moment we have received absolutely nothing. I believe that all the international promises are mere lies and no one cares about our catastrophe. ... I\u2019ve been waiting for the US aid planes to come since the morning to pick up at least few bottles of water for my family, however, they have never come. Can you tell me where are they? There are more than 50 wounded Yazidis on the mountain, they were shot by IS fighters while they were fleeing their homes in Sinjar town. They can\u2019t get a piece of cotton to scrub their wounds. They are dying slowly and we are just watching them without being able to do anything. ... I had to run to the mountain with my 10 kids as soon as IS fighters broke out in Sinjar town. My parents and uncles were too old to walk to the mountain. I left them at home and do not know what they are going through with the lack of telephones connections. I\u2019m so worried about them, still do not dare to go back home to check about them. I know that some of the people who insisted to stay at home, IS fighters have captured them and cut their fingers and heads. I believe the best thing to do to save us in time is to bring helicopters to the mountain itself to evacuate us directly. Obama has a satellite and can see what are we going through on the mountain, why can\u2019t he hurry to help us? US air strikes since last week have slowed the operational tempo of the Islamic State but are unlikely to substantially weaken the group, the Pentagon said on Monday, Reuters reports: Lieutenant General William Mayville, Jr., a senior Pentagon official, told reporters that the strikes had temporarily disrupted the Islamic State\u2019s advance toward Arbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, but were unlikely to impact their operations in other parts of Iraq or Syria. Guardian US national security editor Spencer Ackerman has more: Iraq analyst Sajad Jiyad has more from Maliki\u2019s speech, which he confirms was from earlier today: Maliki: The political process has given to us, through the constitution, the freedom in Iraq Maliki: We are shocked to see the constitution being violated. The Iraqi people are saddened and afraid of what is happening Maliki: We said that Thursday\u2019s violation would not be allowed. Then on Sunday a second violation by the President. Maliki: Until Sunday night we were told to wait when we requested the official nomination by the President for SoL bloc leader Maliki Maliki: They said wait until 3pm the next day (on Monday) and they had already agreed to violate the constitution by nominating Abadi Maliki: The President should not have taken this step, the President said I will nominate Abadi regardless of what courts say Maliki: This violation will open doors for all to violate the constitution and destroy the political process Maliki: We have presented evidence that we are the only legal bloc allowed to nominate the PM Maliki: The largest bloc as per the constitutional requirement and confirmed by the Supreme Court is SoL and they nominated Maliki Maliki: When we uncovered the foreign interference by the US, they stood with the violators of the constitution instead of correcting them Maliki: We will stand in the face of all violations of the constitution The US state department spokesman says Nouri al-Maliki is still prime minister of Iraq, Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts reports: Dan writes: State Dept denies US had any role in the selection of new prime minister delegate to replace al Maliki. \u201cconstitutional process is working\u201d Maliki is speaking on television. Earlier remarks he made in an appearance with political allies were not broadcast at the time. A screen grab of the current broadcast indicates the remarks now airing were pre-recorded and held. A Washington Post correspondent captures some of the speech: The US secretary of state welcomes the nomination of Abadi as Iraqi premier: Still no mention of Maliki out of the USA. Sheera Frankel of BuzzFeed is also reporting on the wrenching plight of displaced people in northern Iraq. \u201cSo many of the Iraqi IDPs we spoke to today wanted to know why the US did nothing when ISIS advanced in Iraq, or when they took Mosul,\u201d she writes: UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Monday welcomed what he described as \u201cthe forward movement toward government formation in Iraq,\u201d Reuters reports: \u201cHe encourages Dr. al-Abadi, Prime Minister-designate, to form a broad-based government acceptable to all components of Iraqi society,\u201d U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters. Dujarric said Ban worries that the increased political tensions coupled with the threat posed by the military offensive of Islamic State militants \u201ccould lead the country into even deeper crisis.\u201d As our live blog coverage continues, here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki appeared on state TV with 30 supportive MPs to defy an attempt to dislodge him. Earlier Monday, the Iraqi president officially nominated a new prime minister, Haider al-Abadi. The White House has turned its back on Maliki, once the centerpiece of an American plan for a stable, democratic Iraq. Vice president Joe Biden called Abadi to congratulate him. An official description of the conversation did not mention Maliki. There was no clear sign of Iran moving to prop up Maliki. On Sunday night Maliki appeared to control significant portions of the military. Special forces teams surrounded the presidential palace in what was described as an intimidation attempt. The United States announced shipments of light arms and ammunition to the militia forces of Iraqi Kurdistan, who are fighting Islamic State militants. The RAF is deploying Tornado jets with surveillance equipment to the area. The United States conducted airstrikes on Islamic State fighters\u2019 positions Sunday, military officials said, reportedly destroying a convoy moving against Kurdish forces. A humanitarian crisis deepened in the mountains outside Sinjar in the north, as thousands of Yazidi people remained stranded after being driven from their homes by the IS advance. Dramatic scenes of desperation and anguish played out as military helicopters ferried aid to Yazidis and evacuated a small number of them. Ned Parker, Baghdad bureau chief for Reuters, writes that Haidar al-Abadi, the nominee to be the next Iraqi prime minister, \u201cis seen as part of a moderate Dawa clique thought to want to push reforms [and] attempt to repair Iraq\u2019s serious breaches.\u201d Opposite Abadi in the Dawa party are members of parliament who threw their lot in with Maliki in an appearance on state TV Monday. (Read more here.) Parker continues: #Iraq\u2019s Dawa is now split between Maliki opponents and #Maliki and his network of relatives, longtime supports and clients. Swing vote in Maliki\u2019s battle to stay in power will be his clients in the judiciary and the military. Iraqi generals could be the swing vote Dawa/SOL clique rallied behind Abadi because they fear losing PM slot to other Shiites, who would likely back Chalabi or Adel Abdel Mehdi Potential danger: Islamic State will likely try to seize advantage of the internal Shiite fight over PM and push for chaos, sectarian strife Update: Zaid al-Ali of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance replies that the judges will not follow Maliki \u2013 \u201cThey did in the past coz they were under threat but they wont intervene on his behalf now\u201d: The Guardian\u2019s Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) follows up on his earlier report on a phone call from US vice president Joe Biden to Iraqi president Fuad Masum. \u201cFrom push to shove,\u201d Spencer writes: Before Haidar Abadi has been installed as PM, Vice President Biden called the \u201cprime-minister designate\u201d to \u201ccongratulate him on his nomination.\u201d Yet again Nouri al-Maliki\u2019s name isn\u2019t mentioned. Note from this White House readout how the Obama administration appears to be preparing for more robust military intervention once Abadi becomes prime minister: Vice President Joe Biden called Iraqi Prime Minister-designate Haider al-Abadi to congratulate him on his nomination to form a new government and develop a national program pursuant to Iraq\u2019s constitutional process.The Prime Minister-designate expressed his intent to move expeditiously to form a broad-based, inclusive government capable of countering the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and building a better future for Iraqis from all communities.The Vice President relayed President Obama\u2019s congratulations and restated his commitment to fully support a new and inclusive Iraqi government, particularly in its fight against ISIL.The two leaders also discussed practical steps towards fully activating the bilateral Strategic Framework Agreement in all of its fields, including economic, diplomatic, and security cooperation.Prime Minister-designate Abadi thanked Vice President Biden for the call, and they agreed to stay in regular communication as the government formation process proceeds. The United States move to arm Kurdish forces represents a reversal of a US strategy of doing business via Baghdad \u2013 and stems in part from the overriding US policy objective of opposing the IS fighters, writes Cale Salih in Comment Is Free: Obama needs the Kurds, and he knows it. They are largely secular and pro-Western, but also maintain dynamic ties to both Iran and Turkey. They offer a potential base from which the US can stage counterterrorism operations against Isis. Iraqi Kurdish parties have links to Kurdish groups in Syria, and Kurdistan Worker\u2019s Party-affiliated Syrian Kurds have been one of the only militias able to effectively fight Isis there. Kurdistan is a much-needed safe haven for refugees from Syria, and internally displaced people from other parts of Iraq. It offers a stable, economically prosperous buffer zone right at the intersection of several regional conflicts. A weak, unstable Kurdistan would allow Isis and other militants to more easily move between Iraq and Syria. Read the full piece here. Containing IS fighters is not the only reason for US strikes in northern Iraq. In a New Yorker piece titled \u201cOil and Irbil,\u201d Steve Coll outlines another strong interest: Obama\u2019s advisers explained to reporters that Erbil holds an American consulate, and that \u201cthousands\u201d of Americans live there. The city has to be defended, they continued, lest ISIS overrun it and threaten American lives. Fair enough, but why are thousands of Americans in Erbil these days? It is not to take in clean mountain air. ExxonMobil and Chevron are among the many oil and gas firms large and small drilling in Kurdistan under contracts that compensate the companies for their political risk-taking with unusually favorable terms. (Chevron said last week that it is pulling some expatriates out of Kurdistan; ExxonMobil declined to comment.) With those oil giants have come the usual contractors, the oilfield service companies, the accountants, the construction firms, the trucking firms, and, at the bottom of the economic chain, diverse entrepreneurs digging for a score. Read the full piece here. The U.S. is deploying a disaster response team to Iraq help distribute humanitarian aid to Yazidis and other displaced people in the north, the Associated Press reports: U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Rajiv Shah said Monday the team will help speed food, water and other life-saving supplies to Iraqis. Much of the assistance will go to [Yazidis]...Shah said the U.S. teams would help coordinate the assistance distribution among Iraqi officials, international partners and humanitarian aid agencies. U.S. military officials say American fighter aircraft struck and destroyed several vehicles Sunday that were part of an Islamic State group convoy moving to attack Kurdish forces defending the northeastern Iraqi city of Irbil, the Associated Press reports: American soldiers and civilians are living in that Kurdish city. Officials say in a statement that the air strike was one of a series against militants in Iraq in recent days. Political allies of Nouri al-Maliki dug in their heels with a televised address Monday in which Khalaf Abdul-Samad, a member of Maliki\u2019s Dawa Party, said the nominee to replace Maliki has no legitimacy. Abdul-Samad said prime minister-nominate Haider al-Abadi \u201conly represents himself\u201d, as a grim-faced Maliki stood beside him, Reuters reported. Maliki apparently also spoke, reports Iraq analyst Sajad Jiyad \u2013 although his words were apparently edited out of broadcasts in Iraq Monday: \u201cClearly what Maliki said was edited out of the clip broadcast on Maliki\u2019s own Afaq channel and on Iraqiya TV,\u201d Jiyad writes. Nuri al-Maliki is already starting to become an unperson to the Obama administration, the Guardian\u2019s Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) reports: Hours after Prime Minister Maliki appeared to launch a last-ditch effort to preserve power \u2013 a move rapidly condemned by a host of senior US officials \u2013 the US has openly sided with his nemesis, President Fuad Masum, in the current struggle over the next Iraqi premier. Vice President Joseph Biden called Masum to offer \u201cfull support\u201d in the unfolding power struggle, according to a White House readout of a morning phone call between the two men. The official US description of the call does not even mention Maliki\u2019s name \u2013 a startling abandonment of a leader whom the US helped install in 2006 and frequently praised thereafter. The White House account: Vice President Biden called Iraqi President Fuad Masum this morning to discuss the ongoing government formation process in Baghdad and to express the United States\u2019 full support for his role as guarantor of the Iraqi Constitution. President Masum discussed with the Vice President the nomination of Hayder al-Abadi to be the next prime minister. The Vice President commended Masum for meeting this key milestone and reiterated President Obama\u2019s repeated calls for the timely creation of a new, more inclusive government that will be able to address the legitimate concerns of all Iraqis. Vice President Biden also emphasized President Obama\u2019s desire to boost coordination with a new Iraqi government and Iraqi Security Forces to roll back gains by the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant. President Masum thanked the Vice President for his continued support. Spencer: \u201cPhone calls like this are how diplomatic facts are created.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) reports on the weaponry the United States plans to provide to the militia forces of Iraqi Kurdistan: [Weaponry] is said to be light arms and ammunition, brokered not through the Defense Department \u2013 which supplies Baghdad and its security forces with heavy weaponry \u2013 but the Central Intelligence Agency, which is better positioned to supply the Kurdish peshmerga with Russian-made guns like AK-47s that the US military does not use. US officials say they are not currently considering providing Kurdish forces, which are not under the control of the Iraqi government in Baghdad, with missiles, armored vehicles or helicopters. The move to arm them raises questions about how the US-provided rifles will affect the military balance against the Islamic State (Isis), which has captured US-supplied armored Humvees and other heavy weapons from the Iraqi military. The CIA declined to comment. Read the full piece here. The RAF is deploying Tornado jets to northern Iraq but there are no plans for them to take any offensive action against Isis extremists, Whitehall officials have told the Guardian, Richard Norton-Taylor reports: \u201cMinisters want to be seen to be doing something for political and presentational reasons\u201d, said a well-placed government source. The Tornados, equipped with advanced Raptor reconnaissance pods, will be used for surveillance operations. \u201cThere are no plans for any kind of kinetic action; they are not going for that\u201d, said a senior official. The US had not asked the UK for any help, Whitehall officials said, echoing the widely held view that the move was designed to appease those MPs, including Conservatives, who have been urging the government to do more than provide humanitarian help. Channel 4 has published video footage of Yazidi rescue scenes described by correspondent Jonathan Rugman on Twitter. Desperate people crowd to board a military helicopter as aid is passed out. Rugman helps drag a limp, dehydrated child aboard. The Yazidis who make it aboard shed tears. There are too few such missions, Rugman reports, and many are still stranded and in danger of succumbing to heat, exposure, or the fighting. In his efforts to remain in power, Maliki does not appear to have a lifeline to Tehran. In an interview on the Foreign Policy Association blog, Reza Marashi of the National Iranian American Council says that Tehran is willing to toss Maliki by the wayside: The problem is less about Maliki and more about sectarianism across the political, religious and ethnic spectrum. Maliki is certainly guilty of this counterproductive approach \u2013 but so too are leaders of Iraq\u2019s other religious and ethnic groups. The U.S. (and Iran) have been critical of Maliki on both a tactical and strategic level \u2013 both of which center on his overly sectarian governance. This highlights an important aspect of America\u2019s strategy that overlaps with Iran\u2019s: they are less concerned with Maliki or any specific individual in Iraqi politics, and more concerned with protecting their geostrategic position. Neither the U.S. nor Iran is wedded to Maliki, but rather to the current Shia-led power structure in place that ensures its interests in Iraq are achieved. If Maliki proves to be a liability, Washington and Tehran are willing to cut off the head of the snake in order to save the body. Working to unite Iraq\u2019s Shia factions \u2013 with our without Maliki at the helm \u2013 and then uniting those Shia factions with Sunnis, Kurds and others best ensures that the U.S. and Iran maximize the levers of power at their disposal to secure their interests. Read the full piece here. (h/t: @rayajalabi) A member of Maliki\u2019s political bloc \u2013 and his family \u2013 said on Monday \u201cwe will not stay silent\u201d over the president\u2019s nomination of a new prime minister, Reuters reports: \u201cThe nomination is illegal and a breach of the constitution. We will go to the federal court to object to the nomination,\u201d Hussein al-Maliki, Maliki\u2019s son-in-law, told Reuters. Jonathan Rugman of Channel 4 news was on a helicopter delivering aid and evacuating Yazidis trapped on Mt. Sinjar. The helicopter came under fire, apparently from fighters with the so-called Islamic State, he reports, but there were no casualties. Rugman\u2019s Twitter feed has a vivid description of the Yazidi plight. \u201cDesperate Yazidi refugees plucked from Mt Sinjar by Iraqi army helicopter,\u201d he writes: Many refugees in tears after 10 days stranded on mt Sinjar with no food, water. 33 degree heat At one point I found myself dragging dehydrated children to the back of the helicopter for safety. Very distressing scenes. Unbelievable scenes on mt Sinjar. Saw small families trapped in middle of nowhere. Many of these people will die if not evacuated ASAP. When our helicopter came under fire from IS the refugee crying started again. Children terrified by sound of machine gun fired in return. Here\u2019s a summary of another eventful day in Iraq. Haider al-Abadi has been chosen to be Iraq\u2019s new prime minister to replace the much-criticised Nouri al-Maliki. Abadi called on Iraqis to unite against the \u201cbarbaric\u201d campaign waged by Islamist militants after being asked to form a new government by Iraq\u2019s president. There has been no word yet from Maliki who is expected to resist the new appointment. Last night he accused the president of acting outside the constitution. US secretary of state John Kerry urged Maliki not to stoke tensions further. Senior US officials say the Obama administration has begun directly providing weapons to Kurdish forces. A state department spokesman confirmed that US has been supplying Kurds with weapons for a week. Kurdish government officials pleaded for weapons support from the west, but said they did not want to see foreign troops on the ground. Three days of US air strikes have helped Kurdish forces retake some territory from the radical Sunni group Islamic State. The Peshmerga said they overtook Islamic State positions in Makhmur District, a region north of the city of Kirkuk, as well as the nearby town of Gwair, the Wall Street Journal reports. But early on Monday Islamic State militants took control of Jalawla, north of Baghdad. David Cameron in under pressure to recall parliament, as some MPs called for the UK to join the US in conducting air strikes. The government emergency committee was due to discuss the crisis. Thousands of besieged Yazidi people remain trapped on the Sinjar mountain and will need military protection before they can escape Islamist militants. Those who have managed to flee say US air strikes helped save them. The United States is exploring options to evacuate those Iraqis still trapped on a mountain in northern Iraq by Islamist militants.\u201cWe\u2019re reviewing options for removing the remaining civilians off the mountain,\u201d deputy US national security adviser Ben Rhodes told Reuters. Iraq\u2019s new prime minister has called on Iraqis to unite against the \u201cbarbaric\u201d campaign waged by Islamic State militants. \u201cWe all have to cooperate to stand against this terrorist campaign launched on Iraq and to stop all terrorist groups,\u201d Haider al-Abadi said in remarks broadcast on state television just after the president asked him to form a government. Nouri al-Maliki is unlikely to go quietly and is set to resist Abadi\u2019s appointment, according to Reuters. He has defied calls by Sunnis, Kurds, some fellow Shia and regional power broker Iran to step aside for a less polarising figure. State television showed footage of president Masum shaking hands with Abadi and telling him: \u201cI hope you will be successful in forming a broader-based government.\u201d Abadi is a low-key figure who spent time in Britain. According to his Facebook biography, his favourite quotation is \u201cthe key to leadership is tolerance\u201d. Educated at the University of Manchester, Abadi served as the head of parliament\u2019s finance committee, a political adviser to the prime minister and minister of communications. In June Abadi warned that Iraq would turn to Iran for help in combating Isis unless the US launched air strikes. Iraq\u2019s deputy speaker Haider al-Abadi has been asked to be Iraq\u2019s new prime minister, according to his Facebook account. It said he has been asked to form a government by Iraq\u2019s Kurdish president Fuad Masum. Iraq\u2019s supreme court has corrected a state TV report claiming it backed Nouri al-Maliki as prime minister. The US has begun shipping arms and ammunition to the Iraqi Kurdish forces fighting IS, a state department spokeswoman has confirmed. \u201cWe\u2019re working with the government of Iraq to increasingly and very quickly get urgently needed arms to the Kurds,\u201d Marie Harf told CNN. \u201cThis includes the Iraqis providing their own weapons from their own stocks, and we\u2019re working to do the same thing from our stocks of weapons that we have.\u201d Harf said the effort had been under way since last week, but did not say which US agency was leading the effort or how many and what type of weapons had been sent. Thousands of besieged Yazidi people remain trapped on the Sinjar mountain and will need military protection before they can escape Islamic militants, Martin Chulov reports from Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. In telephone update close to the border, Martin said the only conceivable way to protect more civilians from Isis fighters is to establish a military corridor. They have no means of escaping, many are old and infirm. Unless there is a military solution they may well be destined to a fate that is not worth considering on a mountain top. It [air strikes] are not necessarily going to help people on the southern side of the mountain. There is no access over the top for those people stranded there. They have to somehow get down and then turn east or west before heading north. It is probable that the American would rely on proxies [to secure such a corridor] than do it themselves. They would provide the air cover and perhaps some heavy weaponry on the ground. Hundreds more Yazidi fleeing Islamist militants have crossed into Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq on Monday. And all those who have escaped think the US air strikes have helped saved their lives, Martin said. But the refugees face an especially grim plight as they get word of the persecution facing relatives who were unable to escape. One of the Yazidi men who fled was called by his daughter pleading for help saying she was about to sold as a sex slave. \u201cIt was a just a heartbreaking conversation to listen in on,\u201d Martin said. Kurdish peshmerga forces are currently outgunned by the Islamist militants, Martin said. They simply don\u2019t have the heavy weaponry to take on Isis ... Their commitment doesn\u2019t necessarily win them battles. Heavy weaponry is absolutely necessary. It has proven to have slowed the momentum of the Islamic State. If the Kurds could use artillery that would be very helpful. It is necessary to turn this battle in their favour. Any British role in northern Iraq was described by officials as \u201cvery much a humanitarian operation\u201d, writes Richard Norton Taylor. The government would not send any combat troops there are no UK special forces in the area either, officials insisted. However the Ministry of Defence revealed that there had been a problem even with humanitarian operations. An RAF Hercules reached northern Iraq on Sunday night but an aid drop was not possible because of the risk to people below, it said. An RAF spokesperson said: \u201cThe safety of the Yazidi community is paramount; with a number of people at the drop sites this morning, the crew made the responsible decision not to carry out the air drop to ensure that the lives of those in the area would not be put at risk. We plan to deliver the next drop as soon as possible.\u201d Iraq\u2019s National Alliance bloc, which includes Iraq\u2019s biggest Shia parties, is reported to have nominated deputy speaker of parliament Haider al-Abadi as prime minister, according to unconfirmed reports. There is confusion about whether the supreme court is backing Maliki, as state TV reported. Earlier it said the court had ruled that Maliki\u2019s bloc was the biggest in parliament. But this has since been denied, according to reports on rival TV channels. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, has cautioned against the \u201cterrible illusion\u201d that the crisis in Iraq can be solved by \u201csurgical military action\u201d, writes Mark Brown. But he conceded that intervention was unavoidable to prevent \u201cgenocidal breakdown\u201d. Asked about the situation in Iraq at the Edinburgh international book festival, he said: \u201cThe assumption that a little bit of tidy, surgical military action would create western-style democracy in the Middle East is a terrible illusion. \u201cAs it is, we\u2019re faced with a choice of a number of very unpalatable alternatives. I think that the humanitarian, protective steps currently being taken are more or less unavoidable if we\u2019re not to see complete genocidal breakdown.\u201d Williams added: \u201cIt\u2019s a hideous situation and unfortunately an entirely predictable one. It\u2019s a trajectory going forward for the last ten years at least.\u201d The disempowering, the exclusion and virtual expulsion of religious minorities in general but Christian minorities in particular from any number of societies there. It\u2019s something which we ought to be profoundly concerned about. \u201cThe kind of society in which minorities of all kinds, including Christian ones, is going to be secure is not the kind of society that\u2019s being created in most Middle Eastern environments at the moment. \u201cI hope we do not repeat the mistakes of 10 years ago.\u201d Here\u2019s a roundup of the latest developments: Senior US officials say the Obama administration has begun directly providing weapons to Kurdish forces, according to AP. The officials wouldn\u2019t say which US agency was providing the arms or what weapons were being sent, but one official said it wasn\u2019t the Pentagon. A state department official confirmed that the Kurds were being armed by various sources, but refused to state whether the US was involved. Kurdish government officials pleaded for weapons support from the west, but said they did not want to see foreign troops on the ground. Three days of US air strikes have helped Kurdish forces retake some territory from the radical Sunni group Islamic State. The Peshmerga said they overtook Islamic State positions in Makhmur District, a region north of the city of Kirkuk, as well as the nearby town of Gwair, the Wall Street Journal reports. But early on Monday Islamic State militants took control of Jalawla, north of Baghdad. Iraq\u2019s supreme court has backed Nouri al-Maliki\u2019s attempt to serve a third term as prime minister by declaring that his bloc is the biggest in parliament. The court\u2019s decision is \u201cvery problematic\u201d, a senior Iraqi official told Reuters. The United States has thrown its weight behind Iraqi president Fuad Masum after he was accused by prime minister Nouri al-Maliki of violating the constitution. US secretary of state John Kerry urged Maliki not to stoke tensions further. David Cameron in under pressure to recall parliament, as some MPs called for the UK to join the US in conducting air strikes. The government emergency committee was due to discuss the crisis. The United States is exploring options to evacuate those Iraqis still trapped on a mountain in northern Iraq by Islamist militants. \u201cWe\u2019re reviewing options for removing the remaining civilians off the mountain,\u201d deputy US national security adviser Ben Rhodes told Reuters. A US official has refused to confirm or deny AP\u2019s report that the US has begun arming the Kurds. The unnamed state department official said only that the Iraqi Kurds were being \u201carmed by various sources.\u201d AFP asked the official if the United States was supplying weapons. He replied: I can\u2019t go into that. There are a lot of discussions taking place between a lot of countries. They are getting something rapidly. Italy has requested a meeting of European foreign ministers on Iraq and is pushing to give Kurds military support.. \u201cWe are evaluating with our principle European partners more efficient means\u201d of stopping the advance of jihadist militants, Italian foreign minister Federica Mogherini said, AFP reports citing a radio interview. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about military intervention but providing support, even of a military sort, to the Kurdish government,\u201d she said. Mogherini said she had written to the European Union\u2019s Catherine Ashton to ask for a foreign ministers\u2019 meeting on \u201cIraq, Gaza and Libya, three crises which concern Europe directly.\u201d \u201cSeveral countries are making a move, but the initiative must be European,\u201d she said. On Sunday France it was looking at supplying arms to Iraq\u2019s Kurds to fight jihadists, in liaison with its EU partners. Islamic State militants have captured the town of Jalawla, north-east of Baghdad, after weeks of clashes with Kurdish fighters, Reuters reports citing police sources. The latest gain underlines the fluid nature of the conflict after Kurdish forces retook territory from Islamic State north of Kirkuk. The seizure of Jalawla, 115km (70 miles) from the Iraqi capital, came a day after a suicide bomber killed 10 Kurdish fighters there. The militants also took control of two nearby villages. The UK government\u2019s emergency committee is to meet in an hour\u2019s time to discuss the situation in Iraq. David Cameron, who is currently on holiday, is coming under pressure to recall parliament. Air strikes aimed at halting the advance Islamic State militants have been effective and the US is open to further requests for help, the US secretary of defence has declared. But Chuck Hagel has not confirmed that AP report that the Pentagon has starting arming the Kurds. Hagel said Washington was constantly assessing the situation after President Barack Obama authorised the action to help break the siege of Mount Sinjar, where thousands of civilian refugees from the Yazidi religious minority had been trapped. \u201cThey have been very effective from all the reports we have received on the ground,\u201d he said of the air strikes when asked in Sydney, where he is attending annual Australia-US defence talks, AFP reported. \u201cWe are constantly assessing where we can continue to assist Iraqi security forces and where, as we build partnerships, we will work with the Iraqi government. \u201cThe Iraqi government requested our help and assistance and we will continue to consider further requests from the Iraqi government,\u201d he added. Iraq\u2019s supreme court has thrown a spanner in the works by backing Maliki. It has just ruled that Maliki\u2019s bloc is the biggest in parliament, meaning he could retain his position, state TV reported. The president, according to the constitution, must now ask Maliki to form a new government in Iraq. Maliki accused President Faud Masum of acting unconstitutionally in a defiant speech on Sunday. The court\u2019s decision is \u201cvery problematic\u201d, a senior Iraqi official told Reuters. \u201cThis will make the situation very, very complex,\u201d said the official who asked not to be named due to sectarian sensitivities in Iraq. US secretary of state John Kerry has urged Maliki not to stoke political tensions further after the Iraqi prime minister deployed forces in Baghdad and accused the president of violating the constitution. \u201cThe government formation process is critical in terms of sustaining stability and calm in Iraq, and our hope is that Mr Maliki will not stir those waters,\u201d Kerry told reporters in Sydney. Reuters quoted Kerry saying: \u201cOne thing all Iraqis need to know, that there will be little international support of any kind whatsoever for anything that deviates from the legitimate constitution process that is in place and being worked on now.\u201d It added: Kerry said it was up to Iraqis to decide who their prime minister was going to be, but added it was clear civilians were looking for change. A bloc comprising Iraq\u2019s biggest Shia parties is close to nominating a prime minister, the deputy speaker of parliament Haider al-Abadi said in a tweet on Monday, directly challenging Maliki. \u201cWhat we urge the people of Iraq to do is to be calm, there should be no use of force, no introduction of troops or militias in this moment of democracy for Iraq,\u201d Kerry said. There are unconfirmed reports that Abadi himself is being lined up as a possible new prime minister. Until now the US has been reluctant to arm the Kurds, according to analysis from the US security consultancy Stratfor. In a paper published on Friday it said the US was concerned about emboldening the Kurds. The United States is keen to avoid alienating Iraq\u2019s Sunni and Shiite Arab groups, which are currently locked in difficult political negotiations in Baghdad. Ankara, Tehran and Washington will provide minor assistance geared toward preventing the establishment of an Islamic State launching ground in the Kurdish region for strikes against Turkish, Iranian or energy targets, but there is a clear consensus against providing enough material help to support future Kurdish independence claims or embolden the Kurds to engage Arab Iraqi competitors with more robust conventional military capabilities. Senior US officials say the Obama administration has begun directly providing weapons to Kurdish forces, AP reports. The US previously had insisted on only selling arms to the Iraqi government. The officials wouldn\u2019t say which US agency is providing the arms or what weapons are being sent, but one official said it isn\u2019t the Pentagon. The CIA has historically done similar arming operations. Officials say the administration is close to approving plans for the Pentagon to arm the Kurds. Recently the US military has been helping facilitate weapons deliveries from the Iraqis to the Kurds, who had been losing ground to the Islamic State. Lord Dannatt, the British army\u2019s former chief staff, has backed calls for military action to stop the advance of Sunni militants, including limited forces on the ground to help direct air strikes, writes Josh Halliday. Speaking on the Today programme, Dannat said: In the short term there needs to be military support very quickly to the peshmarga... certainly continuing air strikes, they need to be well targeted and it may be that we need people on the ground to make sure those air strikes are well targeted and effective. Asked if there should be UK troops on the ground, he said: I\u2019m talking about \u2018we, the west\u2019. The US in the lead and us in support, we all carry some responsibility. The breakdown in Iraq society we have some culpability for that, therefore it is difficult for us to say \u2018not our problem\u2019. The air strikes need to be stepped up and it may need people on the ground to ensure the air strikes are well targeted and therefore effective. We\u2019ve got to watch the situation very carefully but make sure were not so inactive that a genocide like Rwanda or Srebrenica is not repeated. We all were told certain things in 2003 that turned out to be palpably incorrect. We can see a different situation now and we\u2019ve really got to look carefully [and make sure] that there isn\u2019t about to be a genocide, one we\u2019re watching. It may be unpopular but it might be the right thing to do. A group of MPs is calling for the UK to launch air strikes against the Islamic State and is urging the prime minister to recall parliament to vote on the matter, according to the Times. Bournemouth West MP Conor Burns told the BBC that government\u2019s action of airdropping supplies was \u201cnot strong enough\u201d. He said: \u201cI think the US and UK should be involved in air strikes. I am not by any means advocating a ground war but I think we should put our special forces in there.\u201d Iraq\u2019s caretaker prime minister Nouri al-Maliki appears to be staging a tentative coup, according to analyst Juan Cole. In his latest blog post, he writes: Al-Maliki for his part appears to have calculated that now is the time to shoe-horn himself into power for another four years. He has discounted the opposition of the Kurds to his serving another term, since Kurdistan itself is now under attack by the vicious so-called \u201cIslamic State,\u201d and has suffered reversals at the hands of the radicals. Kurdistan, a federal region of Iraq, is not presently in a position to dictate who the prime minister will be in Baghdad. Likewise, the Sunni Arab members of parliament have been marginalized by the defection of their home provinces to the \u201cIslamic State.\u201d Some of the Shiite blocs has moved away from him, but they do not have the popularity in parliament that Da`wa does. The irony, of course, is that al-Maliki is basically fiddling as Rome burns, dependent for his political position on political calculations that are themselves irrelevant to the advance of lean, hungry militiamen. Even if Maliki is replaced by a more conciliatory figure, Iraq\u2019s Sunni population is likely to remain suspicious of the Baghdad goverment, writes Patrick Cockburn in the London Review of Books. A Sunni in Mosul, writing just after a missile fired by government forces had exploded in the city, told me: \u2018Maliki\u2019s forces have already demolished the University of Tikrit. It has become havoc and rubble like all the city. If Maliki reaches us in Mosul he will kill its people or turn them into refugees. Pray for us.\u2019 Such views are common, and make it less likely that Sunnis will rise up in opposition to Isis and its Caliphate. A new and terrifying state has been born. Limited US air strikes may backfire, analysts have told the FT as it noted that Islamic State militants appear to have shifted their focus towards Kirkuk. Isis fighters operating in the open are now certain to change their posture, entrenching themselves in urban areas where they will be harder to hit. \u201cWe had one chance to hit their leadership and their command-and-control structures, and now it\u2019s over,\u201d said Ryan Crocker [former US ambassador to Iraq]. The US involvement also may serve as a recruitment tool for Isis, convincing pious young men reluctant to join the group\u2019s fight against fellow Muslims that they are struggling against American imperialism. \u201cFor every drop of blood shed by the Iraqis, Americans will shed a river of blood,\u201d one Isis supporter wrote on Twitter The United States is exploring options to evacuate those Iraqis still trapped on a mountain in northern Iraq by Islamic militants. \u201cWe\u2019re reviewing options for removing the remaining civilians off the mountain,\u201d deputy US national security adviser Ben Rhodes told Reuters. \u201cKurdish forces are helping, and we\u2019re talking to the (United Nations) and other international partners about how to bring them to a safe space.\u201d The Kurdish regional government has appealed for more weaponry as well as continued air strikes in its fight against the Islamic State. But Bayan Sami Rahman, Kurdistan Regional Government High Representative to the UK, said Kurdish forces did not need the help of US or British troops on the ground Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, she said: What we don\u2019t have is the weaponry. We can\u2019t match what ISIS have managed to capture from the Iraqi army ... What we need is to be able match their weaponry and we need the air strikes to degrade facilities. Asked about boots on the ground she said: At this stage I don\u2019t think that is necessary. We have our own boots on the ground. What we are worried about is being outgunned ... The air strikes over the last few days have already shown that with that kind of support our peshmerga can regain the momentum. Welcome to live coverage of the continuing crisis in Iraq. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: \u2022 Three days of US air strikes have helped Kurdish forces retake some territory from the radical Sunni group Islamic State. The Peshmerga said they overtook Islamic State positions in Makhmur District, a region north of the city of Kirkuk, as well as the nearby town of Gwair, the Wall Street Journal reports. \u2022 The United States has thrown its weight behind Iraqi president Fuad Masum after he was accused by prime minister Nouri al-Maliki of violating the constitution. As security forces massed in the capital Baghdad, the under-pressure Maliki made the surprise announcement on state television on Sunday night that he would be filing a complaint against Masum. \u2022 At least half of the 40,000 people besieged by jihadists on a mountaintop in northern Iraq have escaped in the past 24 hours, aided by Kurdish rebels who crossed from Syria to rescue them. Fleeing members of the Yazidi community said their escape had been aided by the YPG, a Syrian Kurdish rebel faction, and by US air strikes on Islamic State positions which had forced the jihadists to withdraw for around six hours on Saturday. \u2022 Islamic State militants have killed at least 500 Yazidis during their offensive in the north, Iraq\u2019s human rights minister told Reuters. Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said the Sunni militants had also buried alive some of their victims, including women and children. Some 300 women were kidnapped as slaves, he added. \u2022 Islamic State has released a new propaganda video purporting to show the group\u2019s military gains in Iraq. The video, believed to have been shot in the past week, shows militants raising flags over Iraqi government buildings and landmarks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
