Montreal", "bodyText": "Why? The snow. The snowfall is something absurd, like nine feet a year, and I'd never really seen the stuff before. It is a small city with the most wonderful eclectic bunch of people. They also have the best of everything in Montreal - whatever your tastes. The best thing? The surrounding countryside is ravishingly beautiful. My ideal day: I'd spend the morning on the slopes, then I'd take a float plane and land on a lake, from where I would grab a canoe and head off white-water rafting. My advice: Take a ride on the St Lawrence river in one of the very large speed boats. You'll get absolutely soaked, but you'll have the most exhilarating time imaginable. Getting there: Cheapflights (cheapflights.com) currently offers flights from Heathrow or Gatwick to Montreal from around \u00a3270 return. Where was your best holiday? My honeymoon, at the Sandy Lane hotel, St James, Barbados. What is the best hotel you have stayed in? Chilston Park, near Maidstone (01622 859803, chilstonparkhotel.co.uk). Where do you want to go next? Hawaii. What do you never travel without? My Apple Mac laptop computer and my Gulfstream V jet (I wish!). \u00b7 Once the face of Robin Hood in the television series, Robin of Sherwood, Michael Praed is currently starring in Contact at the Queen's Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue, London (box office: 08708 901110)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
