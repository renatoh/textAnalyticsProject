Alaska", "bodyText": "Why? As a nine year old, I read Jack London's Call Of The Wild. He said that it was in the far north that he got his perspective. Alaska did that for me, it helped me discover my inner life or soul or whatever the appropriate term is! The best thing? The birds and animals are not frightened of man, so they just accept your presence and look inquisitively at you trying to fathom what you are doing there. It is magic getting close to something so raw and elemental. Getting there: Cheapflights (www.cheapflights.co.uk ) has flights between Gatwick and Anchorage from around \u00a3499pp. Where was your best holiday? A family holiday as a kid at Bangor West, about 14 miles along the coast from Belfast. What is the best hotel you have ever stayed in? It was a small hotel overlooking the harbour in Sydney - but I can't remember the name of it! However, I can name the worst - the famous Raffles in Singapore. It reeked of colonial amnesia and I hated the fawning, attention of the staff. Where do you want to go next? The only place left for me to explore is the landscape of the heart - my impulses are no longer outward, they are inward. What do you never travel without? In Alaska, I took a really tiny penknife a friend gave me for good luck. 'It's for skinning mosquitoes,' she told me. Mosquitoes are very big in Alaska and if you kill one, 50,000 come to the funeral. I never used the knife, but I did pack Deet to ward off the insects.
