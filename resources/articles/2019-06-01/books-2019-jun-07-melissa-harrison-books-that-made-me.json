It\u2019s the kind of book that can transform your entire understanding of the natural world. The book that changed my life A Gleaming Landscape: A Hundred Years of the Guardian\u2019s Country Diary. When I was living in London and craving contact with nature, that column was a lifeline \u2013 and an inspiration. The collection came out in 2006, when nature writing was just getting ready to explode. The book I wish I\u2019d written Max Porter\u2019s Lanny. If I didn\u2019t like him so much I\u2019d be furious with him for being so teeth-grindingly good. The book that influenced me A Black Fox Running by Brian Carter. I read and reread it as a child until its rhythms \u2013 and its vision \u2013 became a part of me. I\u2019m so proud to have helped bring about a new edition, which is now working its magic on a new generation of readers. The book that is most underrated Amy Sackville\u2019s Painter to the King took my breath away. In form and style it\u2019s a masterpiece; it should have won all the prizes going. The book that changed my mind The Progressive Patriot by Billy Bragg. Until I read it, my love of this country had sat a little uncomfortably alongside my politics. Learning more about our rich tradition of radicalism gave me a way to be proud of my national identity, which helped a great deal as I wrote All Among the Barley. The last book that made me cry Amy Bloom\u2019s fictionalised account of the love affair between Eleanor Roosevelt and Lorena Hickok, White Houses. I lived entirely inside that world while I was reading it and cried helplessly at the end. The last book that made me laugh Another Planet by Tracey Thorn, a poignant, often hilarious account of growing up in suburbia. My teenage years in commuter-belt Surrey, although they came little later, were similar in all sorts of respects. The book I couldn\u2019t finish White Noise by Don DeLillo. I know it\u2019s supposed to be a candidate for the Great (read: straight, white and male) American Novel, but however many times I try, it somehow makes me lose the will to live. The book I\u2019m most ashamed not to have read I\u2019m not ashamed of anything I\u2019ve read or haven\u2019t read; books aren\u2019t homework. People are always telling me I must read this or that \u2013 usually books about nature, or about farming in the interwar years. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re right, but if I did I wouldn\u2019t have time to write any more of my own! The book I give as a gift Wilding to nature lovers; Station Eleven by Emily St John Mandel to everyone else. I\u2019ve never read anything like it, and don\u2019t expect to ever again. My earliest reading memory My mum taught all six of us children to read and write before we went to school, using a big scrapbook of beautifully drawn letters she had illustrated herself as a young woman. When I was six or seven I scribbled wantonly on some of the pages, and the shame of it still haunts me. My comfort reading I\u2019ve returned to A Black Fox Running at many difficult points in my life. But if I could reread something for pleasure, right now, it would be Paul Scott\u2019s alluring, devastating portrait of the world my mum was born into and never quite left, the Raj Quartet. \u2022 Melissa Harrison\u2019s most recent novel, All Among the Barley (Bloomsbury, \u00a38.99), is the UK winner of the 2019 European Union prize for literature.
