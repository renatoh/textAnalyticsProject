Mike Tomlinson's first big report, summing up the results of 91 LEA inspections, criticised the unacceptably wide variation in services and said most councils had little effect on school standards. But unlike his predecessor, Chris Woodhead, who questioned whether LEAs should exist at all, Mr Tomlinson defended the part they played in organising school admissions and transport. \"They do have important roles in strategic planning across an area which could never been taken by an individual school,\" Mr Tomlinson said. \"The report gives no comfort to those who believe that the existence of LEAs serves no purpose. It does not support the abolitionist argument. Nor does it support some of the more exaggerated claims made by LEAs.\" The chief inspector's comments amounted to criticism of the Tory \"free schools\" policy, which would, in effect, abolish LEAs. But Mr Tomlinson denied he was being party political. Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, hailed the success of the inspections, introduced by the government in 1997. Mr Tomlinson said 59 of the 91 authorities inspected were performing satisfactorily, of which 19 could be described as good. But 17 performed so badly they required intervention from government. Mr Tomlinson sympathised with LEAs for suffering a decade of \"something approaching turmoil\" as governments chopped and changed their role. Provision of special educational needs was the most worrying area. The LEAs inspected had responded well to its recommendations on tackling racism. Ofsted had searched for evidence of an \"LEA effect\" on school performance but found no strong link, although a well-run authority in a prosperous area could have an impact. Ms Morris said the worst authorities had been inspected first. She was unhappy but not surprised by the difference in standards of LEAs. The government has \"outsourced\" - privatised - some or all services in 18 poor-performing education authorities. Ms Morris said she would continue to encourage even \"authorities in a position of relative strength\" to outsource some services when required. The best performing authorities were, according to the Ofsted report: the corporation of London, Coventry, Kensington and Chelsea, Warwickshire, Lewisham, Birmingham, Oxfordshire, Hammersmith and Fulham, Hartlepool, Newham, Wandsworth, Barking and Dagenham, York, North Yorkshire, Solihull, Hertfordshire, Camden and Bury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
