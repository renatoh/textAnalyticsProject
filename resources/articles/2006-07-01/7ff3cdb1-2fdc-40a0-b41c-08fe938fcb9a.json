The chief executive would like the opportunity to continue, but some board members around the chairman, Peter Sutherland, are keen to stick to the existing rules whereby he will go at 60. Lord Browne will try to clear the air publicly today at a presentation of the company's second quarter financial figures by insisting he will leave in 19 months. But the situation remains fluid. Britain's most admired industrialist has been pushing for a broad statement on the issue that opens the door for investors to press for the retirement rules to be altered allowing the board to change its mind. The dispute began last week after a research note from an oil analyst at Merrill Lynch effectively urged Lord Browne to stay on - in line with his own wishes. Lord Browne has always maintained in public that he is ready to go at the official retirement time, but has often made it clear privately he hates the whole concept of \"retirement\" and feels he is at the height of his powers. His position has been bolstered, ironically, by a string of serious safety problems in America that have left him keen to ensure the company is steered successfully through difficult times. There are also mounting concerns that his expected successor, Tony Hayward - the young head of exploration and production - is not yet ready to take over. Others keen to compete in any succession race would include the head of refining and marketing, John Manzoni, and head of safety and environment, Ian Conn. The board will also feel compelled to look outside of BP. Bruce Evers, oil analyst with Investec Securities, said it was important to clear the air about the succession, describing Lord Browne as \"the most successful British businessman for decades\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
