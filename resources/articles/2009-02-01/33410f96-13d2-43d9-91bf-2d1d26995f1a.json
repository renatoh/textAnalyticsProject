No subscriber to the belief that creative tension can either be healthy or a divide-and-rule philosophy, Sbragia swiftly embarked on a mission to make a friction-filled dressing room harmonious. Having slimmed his overblown squad during January, he insists openness and honesty have replaced bitchy whispers. Whereas Keane said he once made the mistake of sitting down with a group of players in Sunderland's canteen, Sbragia makes a habit of breakfasting and lunching with his squad. \"We have good chats, we discuss what's in the newspapers that sort of thing,\" he explained. \"I don't believe in isolating myself. I know people say keep your distance but I'm doing it my way. I believe it's important to still be approachable. I'm honest with them, I tell them the truth, tell them what we're thinking and try and get them to see the bigger picture. I think they appreciate that. They have opinions and although I make the decisions, we'll discuss those opinions. Sometimes they see things we don't. We try and treat them like adults. \"I've always thought that a manager had to be around players in training, to spot the body language,\" said a man whose managerial style is light years removed from Keane's. Whereas the Irishman rarely joined his players on bonding breaks, Sbragia will travel to Seville for a three-day mini holiday with the squad next week and expects to partake in a range of activities from archery to aqua aerobics. Much more a democrat than a dictator, Sbragia has, however, presided over something of a transfer window purge with several unsettled individuals, most notably El Hadji Diouf and Pascal Chimbonda, moving on. Both had experienced well-documented altercations with team-mates. \"There were too many whispers going on behind backs,\" Sbragia added, \"and players who were unhappy started disrupting the dressing room. I want players that are realistic and understand they won't always be playing. \"I'm really pleased with the squad now; we haven't got seven or eight players drifting round and just complaining anymore. The atmosphere is first rate. And the players haven't got any excuses now. Sometimes when things were going wrong they could blame others for it. But those excuses have gone now. \"I think we've got to be a bit more selective with the players we bring in in the future. We've got to spend a bit more time on the recruitment process and speak to people about the players. \"I want people who will give their all for Sunderland football club and maybe sometimes forget about the socialising. I also want them to mix in and be good for the dressing room. If we have a bad apple it disrupts the dressing room. I think we have to be pernickety about the players we bring in, they have to want to live in the area. That's really important. \"And I don't want people who are always complaining about this or that. I've told the players if you're not happy don't go moaning to someone else, come and see me because it will get back to me eventually. I've told them to just tell me what's on their minds.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
