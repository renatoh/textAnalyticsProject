I\u2019m not being judgy about cleavage, by the way, this applies to men, too. (Think of Fleabag\u2019s hot priest in his dog collar, or the difference two or three buttons unfastened makes to a man wearing a shirt.) Sometimes a no-frills crewneck or a crisp button-down collar are exactly what you need, but when the sun shines, I feel the pull of a low neckline. Not in a frisky way, just because it is nice to feel the sun on your skin. And if you are not a short skirt person, which I\u2019m not, then that means a lower-than-crew neckline. But I can\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry that the off-the-shoulder milkmaid shape of the last couple of summers is on the wane. Nice as it is to ring the seasonal changes when summer finally arrives, we have not, as far as I am aware, time travelled into the 17th century. Lovely to be able to eat your sandwich in the park at lunchtime; unnecessary to dress in full pre-industrial-era peasant cosplay, bare shoulders rising from a froth of broderie anglaise. Also, those necklines are rarely comfortable worn underneath a jacket and, really, you have to carry a straw basket rather than a normal bag, which is an odd look in an office. I make no apologies for overthinking the details of this look because that is what I\u2019m here for, in case you haven\u2019t noticed. There have been field reports of the deep V-shaped neckline showing signs of a comeback, but for now this does still give off a vibe of being imminently off to All Bar One to get hammered on white wine, which isn\u2019t always the mood music we are after. So I turn with interest to the portrait neckline, as seen here. A portrait neckline is just-on-the-shoulder rather than off-the-shoulder, and plunges just enough to be vaguely dressy. It is perfect tabletop wear \u2013 as in, it\u2019s what to wear when you will be seen across a table. (If you are at a dinner party, even the snazziest skirt will struggle to make an impact.) Tabletop wear means a detailed head-and-shoulders look, with your entrance elevated by the kind of shoes that are a treat to wear as long as you don\u2019t have to stand up for too long. (These Jimmy Choo sandals of mine are a decade old but, since I have never walked more than a block in them, they are in mint condition.) A portrait neckline sets the right mood. By which I mean, it\u2019s making me happy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
