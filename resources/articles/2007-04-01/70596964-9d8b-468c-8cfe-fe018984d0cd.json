As soon as today a formal bid for Alliance Boots from the US private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Alliance Boots' deputy chairman, Stefano Pessina, is expected and shareholders will have to decide whether to take the money. Six weeks ago today, Boots' shares soared 15%, to their highest level in eight years, when Pessina confirmed he was working on a \"friendly\" \u00a310-a-share takeover approach for the business where he is the biggest shareholder, with a 15% stake. Three weeks ago today Pessina and KKR increased their offer to \u00a310.40 and Alliance Boots opened its books for due diligence work that the bidders reckoned would take about three weeks. A formal bid, which would take one of Britain's biggest retailers and most trusted high-street brands into private ownership, is now expected - at as much as \u00a310.70 a share. For Pessina, it is a two-way bet: he is likely to bank a cool \u00a3500m by accepting cash for a third of his stake and will reinvest \u00a31bn into the buyout vehicle with the aim of doubling his money in five years. That is the wonder of leveraged investment, private equity's stock in trade. The maths works like this: \u00b7 At \u00a310.70 a share - which now looks likely to be the offer price - the total bid price is \u00a310.4bn. Alliance Boots also has net debt of \u00a31.2bn, meaning the bidders have to find total financing equal to the \"enterprise value\" of \u00a311.6bn. \u00b7 KKR and Pessina are likely to structure their bid as \u00a37bn of debt plus \u00a34.6bn of direct investment, or equity. Pessina's contribution of \u00a31bn will therefore be 22% of the total - meaning his ownership percentage actually rises even though he has taken \u00a3500m off the table. Of course, Alliance Boots will now be more heavily indebted, and have a vast interest bill to face each year, but that is the gamble. \u00b7 Private equity aims to produce an internal rate of return of about 20% a year. When that is compounded it should in theory turn a \u00a31bn investment into \u00a32bn by the end of the fourth year. If it can be done it will be one the swiftest billions ever made by a private individual. It has taken Pessina, 65, his entire life to build his \u00a31.5bn fortune. Now he could make another billion before his 70th birthday. \u00b7 KKR would have to put up \u00a33.6bn - a huge amount for one private equity group. At a 20% internal rate of return it would turn that into \u00a37.5bn by the end of year four. However, it is likely to bring in other private equity players over that period. There have also been suggestions that Merrill Lynch, Boots' former joint broker, which resigned last month to work as an adviser to KKR and Pessina, might take an equity stake. \u00b7 The interest bill on the bidders' \u00a37bn of debt is likely to be about \u00a3500m a year, assuming an interest rate of about 7%. Sources close to the bidders say that banks are queueing up to provide finance for this deal, to the extent that the bidders believe they will be able to use a so-called \"covenant-lite\" arrangement - meaning the banks will attach fewer conditions to their loans. \u00b7 The bidders would attempt to pay down some of the debt finance raised. Private equity-backed bids often focus on property assets. However, Alliance Boots owns only about 100 freehold stores and its Nottingham head office. The portfolio was last valued at \u00a3400m in 1993. It would undoubtedly be worth more now - one source suggested \u00a31bn If the properties were sold and leased back the company would face a rent bill of, say, \u00a350m a year. \u00b7 Once the property is disposed of and the debt reduced, the company would face annual interest and rent bills of about \u00a3470m. This year - the company's first unified results since Alliance and Boots merged last July - the firm is expected to produce pre-tax profits of \u00a3600m. After the buyout, these profits would go to pay the interest and rent bills. \u00b7 There are a few other complications, such as the bidders having to make an upfront contribution to the pension funds. But Alliance Boots' pension funds are relatively well funded and on these figures this is not the most aggressive of financial structures. \u00b7 One big loser from this deal would be the Treasury. The privately owned Alliance Boots would be making very little clear profit and would therefore pay very little corporation tax. Last year the separate companies contributed about \u00a3130m to Treasury coffers. \u00b7 The big \"if\" in all of this is how the bidders might achieve an internal rate of return of 20%. The Boots retail arm of the business has long been a stodgy operation, assailed on all sides by the supermarkets. The chief executive, Richard Baker, who is likely to keep his job if Pessina and KKR win control, is trying to reinvent the chain as a destination for healthcare with sharper prices. The Alliance drug distribution arm is a vast European operation, which has relatively stable long-term prospects, although it is being squeezed by state healthcare budgets. The bidders insist there are no easy gains but that far more could be achieved away from the spotlight of a stock market listing. They are tight-lipped about what exactly they are referring to and few rival retailers or analysts seem to agree that they are handicapped by public company status. However, the bidders have the advantage of Pessina, who knows the business better than anyone. If the bid fails, Alliance Boots and its shareholders face the prospect of losing the man billed as the key visionary and strategist in the company. That, however, has not deterred the financier Guy Hands, whose Terra Firma buyout business, backed by the Wellcome Trust, has emerged as a potential counter-bidder. They are now conducting due diligence on Alliance Boots' books, even though Pessina has made it known he will not work with or for another private equity bidder. Hands obviously does not think the Italian billionaire is indispensable. Several shareholders have become concerned about the situation at Alliance Boots. Privately, they express distaste and distrust. Only a year ago they were being urged to support the merger of the two companies and told the combined group had a very bright future. Now the man who is the group's biggest shareholder wants them to sell out for his own gain. Pessina's silence, and his potential billion-pound bonanza, simply heighten their suspicions.
