Mr Anderson is chairman of Business Control Solutions, a firm which aims to build on its existing IT consultancy work for large financial institutions by cross-selling recently developed regulatory compliance software. BCS targets banks and other City firms with potentially complex compliance issues in the wake of Basel II European anti-money laundering requirements, stricter international accounting standards and US Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance regulation. BCS plans to come to market through a reverse takeover of Aim-listed Honeysuckle, a failed womenswear business where Mr Anderson is chairman and majority shareholder with a 50.1% stake. BCS will not seek to raise funds and will be valued at \u00a319m in the planned deal. The acquired business will repre sent 86% of the enlarged share capital at Honeysuckle, which will be renamed BCS. Mr Anderson was labelled the \"fattest cat\" after leading the sale of the Porterbrook rail leasing business to Stagecoach for \u00a3825m in 1996. He had led a management buyout from British Rail seven months earlier which valued the business at \u00a3565m. His other investments include a 38% stake in Honeycombe Leisure, a chain of 95 pubs and hotels. Advertising company Media Steps will meanwhile announce today that it is seeking an Aim listing and raising up to \u00a32.5m. The company chops up poster adverts and displays them on the risers of staircases in busy locations. Co-founder Roger Bateman will get \u00a3100,000 to buy out his patent. Also floating on Aim is eg Solutions, a back office software provider to the likes of HBOS, Morgan Stanley and Norwich Union. The company will today announce it is seeking to raise \u00a32m in a float expected to value it at up to \u00a315m. Proceeds are to be used for expansion into Europe and the US as well as into the public sector in Britain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
