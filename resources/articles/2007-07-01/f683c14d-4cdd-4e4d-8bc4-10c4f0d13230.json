July 13, 1967 was the day of Tom Simpson's death on the Mont Ventoux, and Wiggins's courageous but ultimately fruitless lone escape was the kind of move Simpson would have understood. It was what the French call un coup de panache, a move in which the cyclist realises there is no guarantee of success, but where turning back is not an option. In the end, there was no discredit in the fact that Wiggin's adventure came to an end just four miles from the finish, where Tom Boonen finally took a stage win after two years' trying. When Wiggins first escaped he was accompanied by five others, but after he took one long turn at the front of the group, he was alone. \"What do you do? It's the Tour de France, so you continue. I got a minute's lead, I thought a counter-attack might come up behind me. They didn't, then I got 10, 15 minutes lead and thought, what do you do? It was my wife Cath's birthday, I knew she'd be watching with the kids, so it was a good way to spend the day with them.\" He may or may not have known it, but these were propitious roads for this kind of lengthy, apparently suicidal move by a Briton: in 1959, the Yorkshireman Brian Robinson raced to the second stage victory of his career at Chalon-sur-Saone, a few kilometres away from the race route, finishing 20 minutes ahead of the field. The Tour peloton has a way of dealing with early attackers: they are left to fry - yesterday in warm sun, which has finally begun to shine - but kept within reach and reeled in shortly before the finish. The script was respected, at least initially; Wiggins rapidly rode to a lead of more than 17 minutes before, finally, Fabian Cancellara's CSC team decided enough was enough and began slowly to catch him. Later, the damage was done by the sprinters' teams, Boonen's Quickstep, Lampre for Daniele Bennati, and T- Mobile. There was a grimly mathematical inevitability about the way they ate into his huge advantage, although he never lost his impeccable riding style, and he was not helped when he broke a spoke in his back wheel 30 miles from the finish. He glared at the offending item as if he could happily have burnt it, and threw it into a hedge. He was not the only British rider to have problems. Mark Cavendish was well placed at the finish but had to sit up when one of his rivals' pedals hit his front wheel, ripping out half the spokes. Wiggins said: \"With 15 kilometres to go I thought it [a stage win] might happen, but there was a bloody headwind towards the finish. I was still doing 45 kilometres per hour, but I knew that behind me they'd be doing 52-53. I knew with 10 kilometres to go I had no chance. It just needed a change of direction in the road and it might have gone in my favour.\" Wiggins will, presumably, have stiff legs when the race enters the Alps today, but he will not be the only one. All eyes will be on the two leaders of the Kazakh-backed Astana team, Alexandr Vinokourov and Andreas Kl\u00f6den, as the after-effects of their crashes on Thursday in Burgundy make themselves felt. Cycling lore has it that the stiffness and soreness from a crash is most acute 36 to 48 hours after a chute, and both \"Vino\" and \"Klodi\" have much to be sore about, although both men started yesterday's stage. Vino, however, was barely able to climb the stairs to the podium where the riders register. He began the stage having had 15 stitches inserted in deep cuts in both knees - which took 3\u00bd hours on Thursday evening and kept him from his dinner - while Kl\u00f6den was confirmed as having a hairline fracture of the coccyx, although Astana were unable to confirm whether it was as a result of Thursday's crash or a hangover from an old fracture. Neither man looked at his ease yesterday. Vino grimaced as he rode and at one point made a gesture which needed no translation: a finger across his throat as if his head were being cut off. Kl\u00f6den was apparently unable to stand on the pedals, which does not bode well for today, even though the only col is the Col de la Colombi\u00e8re, rated first-category for its 10 miles of climbing to a 5,000ft summit. Tomorrow's stage is tougher, including three first-category mountains, of which the toughest is the narrow ascent of the Cormet de Roselend. The Alps are abbreviated this year, with no visit to l'Alpe d'Huez, and one nod to history with the inclusion of the Col du Galibier on Tuesday. The chances are that the favourites will keep their powder dry until next Saturday's time-trial in Albi. Today, the issue is not the steepness of the Colombi\u00e8re, but its position, shortly before the finish, with a vertiginous descent to Le Grand-Bornand. The peloton will hit the climb at speed as is always the case on the first major climb in the Tour. On the first \"judge of pace\", as the French call it, there are always victims, and often surprises. At least one or two contenders will be ex-contenders by this evening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
