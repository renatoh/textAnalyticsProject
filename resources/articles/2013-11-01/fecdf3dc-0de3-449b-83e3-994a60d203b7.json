Thanks to everyone for reading and for all your tweets and emails \u2013 especially those on the format of World Cup qualifying. An interesting subject indeed. I leave you on a note from reader Matt Fifield: Well, the All Whites only need to win 4-0 in the return leg and they\u2019re through \u2013 watch this space \u2013 you heard it first here. And that\u2019s it! Mexico have one foot in Brazil after an utterly emphatic victory. Whistles at the Azteca, as the crowd will the referee to blow up so they can enjoy their celebrations. If nothing else, this lopsided win has allowed us to see the better side of Mexico \u2013 El Tri playing more and more attractive football as they became liberated from the fears of messing this up. Now Jimenez goes weaving through a series of New Zealand defenders, before wrapping his left foot around the ball and whipping it towards the top corner. Yet again, Moss is there to make the stop. That goal actually seems to have stung Mexico a little bit, and they come pouring forward again now, with Layun firing in a low, skiddy effort that Moss once again had to react sharply to save. Another perspective on qualifying routes here from David Hair: As a Kiwi, I think New Zealand Football made a mistake in not following Australia into the Asian Confederation. Sure, we've got an easier path to the World Cup, but it also means we almost never play against competitive opposition, and therefore don't get the opportunities to develop our game. That leaves us exposed when we have to step up - like today. Short term thinking. No sooner have I finished typing that, than New Zealand pull one back \u2013 Chris James hooking a shot off the post and in after the ball was headed down to him near the penalty spot. It\u2019s not going to matter in the grand scheme, but that was actually a pretty tidy finish. Oh dear. Is it even worth going back to Wellington? Rafa Marquez extends Mexico\u2019s advantage even further with a fine header from a corner on the left. Yup, me too. That sound you hear is the thudding of more nails being hammered into a coffin. This was the exact same formula as Mexico\u2019s third goal, Marquez sending a long, angled ball downfield and Layun swinging over a cross which Peralta converted \u2013 this time with a tremendous header into the top left corner of the net. Yet another save from Moss, who flies across his goal to parry an effort from Layun from 25 yards. David Hopkins would like to clear up something regarding his earlier comments: Just to clarify, I wasn't having a go at the US themselves, just suggesting that FIFA, for financial reasons, would very much like to make sure that they get to every World Cup. I understood as much, but lest anyone else didn\u2019t, there you go. And while I don\u2019t buy the conspiracy myself, it is certainly true that the US is a very valuable market \u2013 more 2014 World Cup tickets have been sold to people living in that country so far than any other outside of Brazil. Another New Zealand player loses his chance at playing in the second leg in Wellington, Leo Bertos collecting a yellow card that will earn him a suspension with a fairly needless late challenge in midfield. Yet another save for Glen Moss, who has made plenty today despite conceding three goals. Rafa Marquez\u2019s free-kick from 25 yards might actually have been drifting wide of the keeper\u2019s right-hand upright, but he still did well to get across and get two firm hands on the ball. Lots of interesting responses on both sides of the \u2018how many qualifying spots should go to each region\u2019 debate. Here\u2019s Thom Kelly: In response to Kevin O'Sullivan's email. Asia, Africa and Oceania take up a combined amount of 10 spots if you include the half spots awarded to Oceania and Asia. You take more away from these teams it dilutes the World Cup in to a European tournament with invitees from the rest of the world. Meanwhile Asia can boast that they have had a team make it to a World Cup Semi-Final in the professional era unlike Africa and North America. Another change for New Zealand, who withdraw Chris Wood and send in Rory Fallon. I must admit to feeling a little sorry for Wood, who will miss the second leg due to suspension, but he had failed to make an impact with what little service he had. So, why aren\u2019t New Zealand better? Wasn\u2019t this team capable of drawing with Italy, and everyone else, at the last World Cup? Well, yes, but there were many different factors at play. Italy, of course, were atrocious at that tournament \u2013 clinging on to past glories under Marcello Lippi with too many old (and in several cases, injured) players and not enough faith in youth. And New Zealand had a couple of very important players then that they don\u2019t have here. Winston Reid missed out today with an ankle injury, while Ryan Nelsen has since retired and moved into coaching \u2026 And now the second substitution for Mexico, with Carlos Pena stepping out, and Alonso Escoboza coming in. The hosts are also preparing to take a corner on the left. Mexico are having fun now, pinging the ball around in their own half without a care in the world. No real attempt being made to get forward, but why should they. Here\u2019s an email from Kevin O\u2019Sullivan, responding to the previous discussion of qualifying regions: I'm not sure why David Hopkins has to have a go at the US. If there's a lesson to be learned from these playoffs, it's that CONMEBOL and CONCACAF, on balance, are much stronger than their counterparts in Asia/Oceania. CONCACAF may actually be the only federation with the correct number of qualifying allotments - CONMEBOL and UEFA have too few and Oceania, Asia, and Africa (just) have too many. And now Mexico make their first change as well, Luis Montes coming out to be replaced by Sinha. Also, Ivan Vicelich has been booked for New Zealand for a clumsy challenge on the right-hand side. New Zealand have made their first substitution of the game, sending in Chris James to replace Jeremy Christie. International rules. I like it. That third goal has really taken some of the edge off this game. New Zealand look defeated, which they probably are. Mexico are relaxing into their lead, sitting back and daring the visitors to throw men forward, so that they, in turn could hit them on the break. Right, I really did not mean to spark a big thing with the Australia comment, but people are still emailing me about it, so to clarify one more time: I was speaking geographically, not in terms of footballing federations. I am aware, as I believe most people reading this live blog will be, that Australia chose to move across to the Asian federation some time ago (in 2006, I believe), and as such have been qualifying though that federation. Hope that clears it up! \u201cOle! Ole! Ole!\u201d Mexico\u2019s fans arrived nervous, but they are enjoying themselves now at the Azteca. Oh so easy for Mexico, who put another nail in New Zealand\u2019s coffin with an Oribe Peralta goal to start the second half. There was nothing clever about it \u2013 Marquez launched a long ball upfield, Layun played it low across the box and Peralta arrived on cue to slide it in from six yards out. The defence was all at sea. Off we go again. Just to clear up any confusion on those half-time emails (I\u2019ve had a few perplexed responses) I am aware that Australia went through the Asia qualifying section. The fact remains that Australia are from Oceania, and will be represented at the World Cup. A somewhat conspiratorial take from David Hopkins: With this game shaping up a little like the earlier Uruguay game, has FIFA paid the price for it's ridiculous qualifying arrangements? Rather than just find a space for an Oceania team, they've offered a free pass to a team who finished 4th from a group of six (presumably to guarantee USA participation at every tournament). I\u2019m not sure I buy into your final thought there, David, and let\u2019s not forget that one team from Oceania has indeed qualified, in Australia. But it is true that these games have made for disappointing spectacles. And to play Devil\u2019s advocate, if Mexico are this much better than New Zealand, do they not deserve the place in Brazil, even as the fourth-best in their own region? \"Wonder what Herbert's plan B is?\" ponders Mark Kelly. \"Plan A certainly didn't work.\" Sadly, I dare say that New Zealand will still be playing the next 45 minutes in damage limitation mode. The harsh reality is that they don\u2019t really have the quality to try much else. High-fives all round among the Mexico players, as the referee brings the first half to a close. They enjoyed 82% possession in that first half, but let\u2019s face it, that would only be another stick to beat them with if they hadn\u2019t grabbed those two goals. In a playoff like this, the old clich\u00e9 about goals being the only statistic that matters most certainly applies. Mexico have two, and it would be a surprise not to see them go for even more after the break. Mario Antoni Benitez is not happy with what he has seen so far today: As much as I love the All Blacks, these guys are terrible.They're like a 4th division English team. They can't make a even a simple pass and have no business at a world cup as they showed last time unless you like this sort of football. Mexico are no great shakes either. And yet they did go unbeaten at the World Cup in 2010... Now Mexico have come to life. They are not settling for the two-goal lead now but going in for the kill, Moss only barely getting up quickly enough to beat Peralta to the loose ball after parrying Luis Montes\u2019s shot from the edge of the box. Well, Jimenez did not have to wait long to flush out the frustrations from that Moss save. From the ensuing corner, Pena wins a header near the penalty spot, knocking the ball down into the ground at the edge of the six-yard box. The ball rears back up, and Jimenez reacts sharpest to nod it past Moss from close range. What a goal that would have been! An absolutely outrageous attempt from Raul Jimenez, who contorts his body to execute a sideways scorpion kick that Moss just barely manages to push around the post at full stretch. Mexico put the ball in the net again, but this time the cheers of the Azteca crowd catch in their throats. The flag was up on the near side as Peralta jabbed home from close range. Have to feel a little sorry for Moss, who had been doing his part to keep New Zealand in the game up to that point, but he is also at fault on the goal. It is the keeper\u2019s duty to let his defender know if he wants to come for a ball, and if Moss did so on this occasion then he clearly was not forceful enough. The Azteca erupts as Mexico break the deadlock with a goal borne out of sheer opportunism. A ball forward into the area prompts a miscommunication between Moss and one of his defenders, the pair colliding as the latter tried to head clear. The loose ball fell to Aguilar, who slotted it calmly into an empty goal. New Zealand throw men forward for a long throw-in from the left, but Bertos\u2019s eventual throw turns out not to be that long after all. Mexico clear. Meanwhile, Andy Brodie has a tricky question: your instinct is that Jimenez's shot wasn't in. The refs instinct was it wasn't in. 100,000 fans instinct was that it WAS IN. How does this instinct thing work? If you can find the answer to that question, Andy, I dare say you might be able to publish it in a scientific journal. Mexico are beginning to build up a head of steam here, and now Raul Jimenez goes steaming unchecked through the middle to meet a throughball down the left channel. His pace takes him clean through on goal, but his left-footed shot across goal goes straight at the goalkeeper Moss. ... which they waste. Sadly, I believe Wood is now suspended for the second leg after that yellow card he picked up earlier. Ohhhh, so close for Mexico. Given time 30 yards from goal, Rodriguez unleashes an exocet that swerves violently before slamming into the middle of Moss\u2019s crossbar. Did it take a deflection? That\u2019s certainly what the officials seem to think awarding the hosts a corner \u2026 Layun is working his socks off on the left for Mexico, thundering up and down the left touchline with purpose, but aside from that cross for Peralta, he hasn\u2019t managed to make anything happen just yet. As I type that, he flashes a shot wide of the near post. Second replay still wasn't great, but my instinct is that the ball did not cross. And now a huge roar from the Azteca crowd, who thought their team had opened the scoring with a hooked effort from Jimenez, punched out from underneath the bar by Moss. Did it cross the line? Hard to tell from a first look, so I\u2019m waiting for a replay. Best chance of the game by some distance here for Mexico, as Layun breaks free down the left-hand side and swings a perfect cross into the middle of the box. Peralta was flying in at full speed and arrived at just the right moment to meet the cross, but despite being totally unmarked, could only glance his header across the face of goal. Wood becomes the first player booked, for raising his elbows into an aerial challenge. Time for another email - this one from Patrick McNichol I'm following your blog, cause the game here in NZ is on sky, it isn't free to air. Ricki Herbert, the NZ manager was sacked from his position managing the Wellington Phoenix, because the owners wanted the Phoenix to play like Barcelona. Herbert's style is very defense minded, but now he has the chance to get his own back. I'd like to think that the All Whites can beat Mexico playing very defensively or perhaps come out against Mexico and play like Barcelona. A little sad to hear that this game isn't being broadcast free-to-air in New Zealand. A shame for people to be deprived of a potentially huge national sporting event. And now Wood flashes a shot over the bar from just outside the box for New Zealand. The visitors have barely left their half, and yet they have looked more threatening on the rare occasions that they do. Still a very laboured start, this. Mexico\u2019s players might be familiar with one another from club football, but they have not yet displayed any great cohesion or common purpose. New Zealand finally do break upfield for the first time, and Chris Wood wins a free-kick out by the right-hand sideline. The ball is floated across the area towards a pair of players coming in at the back post, but neither can get a clean connection on the ball. Still, these are exactly the sorts of chances that New Zealand need to generate if they are going to give themselves a shot at pinching a goal in this game. Not yet. The ball might have earlier. Once. A first half-chance of the match for Aguilar, who cuts inside from the right to receive a pass and curl a shot wide of Moss\u2019s far post. He was in a decent position, but was off balance after shrugging off a defender and the shot was not all that close in the end. That said, it doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re sitting, there\u2019s not an awful lot happening at the moment. If you were being generous, you might say Mexico were \u2018probing\u2019. If not, then just \u2018dilly-dallying\u2019 would suffice. I stand corrected on the fullness of this stadium. There is a clear bank of empty seats right behind the two dugouts, one which is made all the more obvious by the Coca Cola logo spelled out on the backs of the unused seats. It seems a shame that such good sets should stay empty while fans are packed into the higher tiers. The economics of modern football doubtless at play. A nervous, clumsy start, as Mexico fumble around in possession while New Zealand set up camp just outside their own box. Here's an email from Paul Cockburn: This game is definitely bubbling under as a major talking point in NZ, though I suspect things will go truly nuts in a week's time with the return leg. The 2009 qualifier against Bahrain was huge - how can this not be bigger? Most All White fans are quietly pessimistic... how different things might have looked playing Panama or Honduras, and it's a big step up from winning a qualifying group against New Caledonia and American Samoa. But they are a decent, hard-working side. If they keep in touch in this leg, things will be very interesting in Wellington next week. We are underway. Meanwhile, I cannot think of a better sign of the time that we live in, than the fact that New Zealand's home stadium has been trolling Mexico's on Twitter in the build-up to kick-off. New Zealand's sounded mostly like a TV audio feed losing signal. Mexico's the usual trumpeting glory. Meanwhile, I have a tweet. The answer to this, clearly, is 10/10. First use of the 'p' word by our ESPN commentary team. Premature, I'd say. New Zealand could easily get out there and show no pluck at all. \"Just wanted to note that there may not be 100k in Azteca for Mexico today,\" writes Darryl Tait by email. \"Lately, the fan totals have declined in line with the team's level of play.\" Interesting to know, Darryl. The images I'm seeing right now suggest that it is, at the very least pretty close to full ask kick-off approaches. But our commentators have also informed us several times that it is \"very cold\", so if it isn't a sell-out, that may also be a factor! Just about 10 minutes to kickoff, which means you still have time to read these two cracking preview pieces - one written from the Mexican perspective, by Jorge Angure Jr, and another from the New Zealand perspective, by Pete Smith. The teams are in, and here they are. Both teams lining up with a five-man defence, which tells you plenty about both New Zealand's aims in this game, and also Mexico's diminished confidence. Caution is the order of the day, but surely Mexico will know that they have to win this game, not draw it. New Zealand, conversely, would be delighted to take this tie back home with the scores still level: Mexico: Munoz; Layun, Rodriguez, Marquez, Valenzuela, Aguilar; Pena, Medina, Montes; Peralta, Jimenez New Zealand: Moss; Lochhead, Vicelich, Durante, Smith, Bertos; McGlinchey, Christie; Barbarouses, Wood, Brockie Mexico vs New Zealand; a nation of 118 million people vs one of 4.5 million; a team that has not failed to qualify for a World Cup since 1986 vs one that has only reached the finals twice in its history. On paper today's game looks like a classic match-up of David against Goliath. But Mexico have not played like footballing giants any time lately. El Tri finished fourth out of six teams in Concacaf's qualifying hexagonal, behind USA, Costa Rica and Honduras. They only got that position with a little help from their greatest rivals. If the US had lost to Panama in their final qualifier, then the latter nation would have taken fourth place. As it was, Graham Zusi's 91st minute equaliser provided Mexico with a last-gasp reprieve. Even so, the hosts are a footballing nation in disarray, having changed coaches four times in their last five games. Anxious to give his team some kind of coherence, Miguel Herrera is expected to start as many as seven players from the team that he also manages, Club Am\u00e9rica, for this game. He has left out players based in Europe, meaning no Chicharito Hernandez, Giovani Dos Santos or Guillermo Ochoa. But if the hosts are not as strong as in past years, they are still a far more daunting prospect than the teams New Zealand have faced in qualifying so far - the likes of the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia making up part of their Oceania schedule. They will also be playing this game at the Estadio Azteca, with more than 100,000 fans on hand to support the home side. Can they do it? We shall soon find out.
