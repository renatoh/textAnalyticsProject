If he wins gold, there will be no surprise if he celebrates with a pirouette. Caines will compete in the 200 metres, though he won the 400m at the world indoors in Lisbon last year. But then he hardly ran again all year because of a persistent hip and pelvic injury caused by his right foot being slightly shorter than his left. It was a problem discovered by Sharon Morrison, head of physiotherapy at the Royal Ballet, who used to work with Britain's ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean. \"My masseur advised me to go and see Sharon,\" Caines said. \"She was given some videotapes of my races and after seeing me, the way I walked and looking at my balance, she knew what was wrong. My shoe has been slightly built up so that everything is level.\" Caines had no intention of going to Vienna but after recording the fastest time in the world on Sunday at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham, where he ran 46.06sec, he changed his mind. His split time in that race was 20.83, the third-fastest 200m by a European this year, and after talking to fellow athletes he requested a place in the team at the shorter distance.
