It would be an epic project. The British government would have to ask voters for permission to join. There would have to be a referendum. As it happens, Britain is already part of an alliance of European democracies. A sizable minority - between 20 and 40 per cent of the electorate - think this is a bad thing and want out. The rest accept the EU as part of the political landscape, to be neither feared nor adored - best ignored. The fact that most people are unbothered by European issues is cited by the government as a reason not to burden them with a vote on the current EU Reform Treaty. That document, say ministers, is a collection of technical amendments to existing EU practice. It is emphatically not, says the government, the same as the constitution that was agreed by European leaders in 2004 and on which a referendum was promised. That is true. The constitution was meant to supersede every past treaty that EU member states had signed. It included symbols of federation, an anthem and grandiose mission statement. The treaty has more modest ambitions. Symbols matter. Tony Blair was right to offer a referendum on the constitution because it acknowledged a fundamental truth about European integration: what started out as a free-trade agreement has evolved into a political entity. That process demands public consent. The mandate Harold Wilson won to stay in the European Economic Community in 1975 cannot be stretched to cover the union that exists now. The treaty is indeed a technical document of relatively modest ambition. But it salvages the political heart of the constitution - streamlined voting, a strengthened European presidency and diplomatic service. So the symbols have been dropped, but the political charge continues apace. What legitimacy can it have without a public vote? The government is in an invidious position. It hopes that voters do not care enough about the EU to clamour for a referendum, but it also hopes that a reformed EU will win over the public with its good deeds. This newly revitalised union will bring peace to Darfur and save the world from climate change. It will prove its worth if only given the chance. The government is gambling that the high-water mark of hostility to Europe has passed. Militant Euroscepticism, goes this view, is the province of reactionary old buffers with discreet racist tendencies, whose minority views are amplified by a Tory-leaning press. So ministers do not match the anti-European rhetoric of those who want a referendum with pro-European arguments of their own. Instead, they put up mealy-mouthed denials and obfuscations based on the arcane distinction between one type of treaty and another; between a promised referendum campaign they are glad they never had to fight and a hypothetical one they fear they would lose. That is not only dishonest, it is cowardly and dangerous. It conforms to a pattern of British governments pretending that European integration is a matter of dull technicality, about which the electorate should not worry its pretty little head. That is the attitude which has allowed anti-Europeans to monopolise the debate for a generation. In fact, many of the arguments against the EU are easily rebutted. The main charge is that it represents a massive transfer of sovereignty from democratically elected politicians to unaccountable bureaucrats in Brussels. That is a grotesque distortion. Power in the European Union is exercised not by the European Commission, but by heads of government, sitting in the European Council. Naturally some compromises have to be made to achieve consensus, but if those compromises have negative consequences for Britain, that is a fault of the Prime Minister of the day. It rather suits elected politicians that their diplomatic shortcomings go unnoticed and that public hostility is deflected on to a fictitious foreign conspiracy instead. The argument about sovereignty conflates two separate anxieties. The first is cultural: that European integration will somehow dilute the essence of Britishness, that the EU wants a culturally homogeneous continent. If that were so, Germany and France, the longest-standing members, would surely have started to look alike by now. Manifestly they do not. Baguettes and biergartens have not been banned. The second anxiety is constitutional: that European integration diminishes the power of the nation state. In fact, the opposite is true. There are many forces in the 21st century working against the power of national governments: the free movement of capital in global financial markets, the explosion in communications and mass migration over the past decade. The recent crash in world stock markets demonstrates how Britain's economic security is vulnerable to decisions made by people far more remote and much less accountable than any European commissioner. Consider a list of issues with which the British government has to grapple. In domestic policy: gun crime, drugs, immigration, people trafficking, terrorism. In foreign policy: Russia's ambitions to monopolise European energy markets; Iran's nuclear weapons programme; economic competition with China and India; global trade talks. Britain cannot hope to be effective if it does not co-ordinate policy on an international level. It can pretend to take unilateral action, raise an imaginary drawbridge over the Channel and watch its authority bleed away. Or it can make policy within Europe. In the 21st century, Britain needs a community of common interests, committed to democratic values and where power is firmly in the hands of elected politicians. It needs a European Union. The EU is not the enemy of the sovereign nation state, it is the only mechanism there is for European governments to wield power on the world stage. But instead of being seen as a bulwark against the forces of globalisation, the EU has become a lightning rod for anxiety about powerlessness and the erosion of national sovereignty. British politicians have abetted that process, tacitly allowing or flagrantly encouraging vilification of Brussels. So now a huge weight of resentment risks falling on the shoulders of one frail treaty. The current political row over a referendum is shabby. David Cameron calculates that he is in a win-win situation. If there is a referendum, he will have extracted a U-turn from Labour and could front a successful 'no' campaign. If there is no referendum, he has made Labour look extraordinarily shifty. But if he plans to head a government one day, he will need something very much like the Reform Treaty on the statute books. If it is ratified by Parliament, he would not repeal it. He is playing good tactical politics, but does not come out of it looking like a Prime Minister-in-waiting. Gordon Brown, meanwhile, wants the issue to fade away, so he does not speak out for the EU. In so doing, he reinforces the impression of a conspiracy. The government imagines that the EU will spontaneously endear itself to the sceptics; the opposition pretends there is no political cost to Britain in sabotaging the whole European project. The entire debate rings hollow. Missing from its core is any intellectual or moral engagement with the need to make the EU work. There is no strategy to make it legitimate in the eyes of the British people. This trivial farce has to end. The argument about Britain's place in Europe has to start anew. A referendum on the constitution would have been an opportunity to do just that. It was the symbolic representation of the EU's evolution from common market to political union. But the treaty is not. Any referendum would end up implicitly being about membership of the union and it would be wrong to hang such a question on this document. But the question will not go away. Because there is a conspiracy, only it does not come from Brussels. It comes from our political leaders who refuse to debate the issues with honesty and vision."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
