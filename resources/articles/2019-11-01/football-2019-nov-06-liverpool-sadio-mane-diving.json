The Senegal forward was accused of \u201csometimes diving\u201d by the City manager after Liverpool\u2019s last\u2011gasp victory against Aston Villa on Saturday \u2013 a suggestion that led J\u00fcrgen Klopp to accuse his opposite number of being \u201cfixated\u201d on his team. Guardiola has since retracted his claim, but with Liverpool holding a six-point advantage over the champions, Man\u00e9 believes the City manager was attempting to raise the temperature before the biggest match of the season so far. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit clever from him to get the attention of the referee but I will just play my football like I\u2019m always doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t pay attention to what he\u2019s saying because it\u2019s part of football. It doesn\u2019t make anything for me. Even though I saw him commenting about it, what he said, for me, I think it\u2019s positive \u2026\u201d Asked if it sounded as if Guardiola was worried about facing a side who have won 10 of their first 11 Premier League fixtures, he said: \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know. You guys know more than me. The only thing I can say I will be for sure ready for the team, to give everything possible, and to help my team. If it could be a penalty for sure I will \u2018dive\u2019 again. If the dive will give me a penalty then I will do it to get it back. Why not? But what J\u00fcrgen said is correct. I do not dive.\u201d Man\u00e9 was booked for simulation against Villa on Sunday before scoring in stoppage time to maintain Liverpool\u2019s lead at the top. That was the third time since the start of the 2015-16 season that the 27\u2011year\u2011old has been cautioned for diving but he insisted the referee, Jonathan Moss, could easily have given the decision the other way. \u201cThere was contact, for sure,\u201d Man\u00e9 said. \u201cMaybe it was not a penalty and he didn\u2019t give it, and he gave me a yellow card. To be honest I don\u2019t have any problem about it. For sure, it can happen in football and we have seen many people, some diving and get penalties, some got a penalty and the referee didn\u2019t give it. That\u2019s football. You have to deal with it. \u201c[I will keep doing] like I\u2019m always doing. It\u2019s what I want to keep doing. If I get a penalty, yeah it\u2019s a penalty. If no penalty, no penalty, but [it will never] change the way I\u2019m playing or the way I\u2019m doing my things.\u201d Michael Oliver will take charge of the game on Sunday in an appointment that may please Liverpool supporters given they have never been beaten in the 18 previous matches he has officiated at Anfield. Klopp\u2019s side have been awarded three penalties \u2013 one more than City \u2013 this season, including for the 94th-minute winner against Leicester, which was given by Chris Kavanagh for Marc Albrighton\u2019s challenge on Man\u00e9. Liverpool have not faced City since the 2-1 loss at the Etihad Stadium in January that was the last time they were defeated in the league \u2013 a run of 28 matches. They have also gone 45 games unbeaten at Anfield since losing against Crystal Palace in April 2017, including the 0-0 draw with City last season in which Riyad Mahrez missed a late penalty. \u201cIt will be very different because we learned a lot from our last games against City,\u201d Man\u00e9 said. \u201cI think I can say we play every kind of game this last two years so I don\u2019t think the game will have any effect on us to be nervous. But for sure it\u2019s an extra motivation for us to play against them, especially at home, and to do everything possible to win the game. It will be really, really important for us to get a positive result and we will be ready, spot-on from the first second until the last.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
