Massa proved he has fully recovered from the head injuries sustained during qualifying for the Hungarian grand prix last August by being fastest for most of the day, the Ferrari driver lapping the Circuit Ricardo Tormo in 1min 12.574sec. But the story of the afternoon was the 41-year-old Schumacher's return to the cockpit after a three-year absence. The seven-times world champion made his first appearance at 3.30pm and settled in immediately by lapping faster than his new team-mate Nico Rosberg, who had driven the Mercedes for 39 laps in the morning not long after its unveiling at the Spanish track. As Schumacher became accustomed to the car and the latest generation of tyres, he reduced his lap time to 1min 12.947sec, the third fastest of the day. \"In a way it's like 91 again [when the German made his debut],\" said Schumacher, after completing 40 laps. \"I was shocked and excited then [and it was the same today]. I felt like I had a toy in my hands. For the first day, the team have done a superb job.\" Massa and Schumacher were split by Pedro de la Rosa as the 38-year-old Spaniard recorded 1:12.784 in his Sauber. De la Rosa, McLaren's former test driver who has not raced in Formula One since 2006, perhaps highlighted the difficulty of making an accurate assessment based on testing lap times, particularly on the first day. \"I'm now 100% ready to return to racing,\" said Massa. \"I was zero afraid, and Hungary did not come into my mind at all. I feel very good from a physical point of view. I did 100 laps, but I could have done much more. After the difficult time I had it's always nice to get back on the track and be competitive.\" With the 2010 regulations banning race refuelling for the first time since 1993, teams and drivers need to become accustomed to the dramatically different handling characteristics of cars which will start the races with at least twice as much fuel as before. It would have been tempting to run with low fuel yesterday to create a good initial impression with a lighter and faster car, particularly if sponsorship deals are still pending. The Sauber (formerly BMW) was notable for its almost complete absence of financial backers during a low key launch on Sunday. McLaren made its first appearance following the launch in England on Friday. With teams restricted to running just one car each day, the initial shakedown was handled by McLaren's test driver, Gary Paffett, as the Englishman went through detailed system checks to set the fifth best time. Jenson Button, the world champion, and Lewis Hamilton are scheduled to share the remaining four days equally in the McLaren MP4-25. Seven of the anticipated 13 teams took part, none of the four newcomers putting in an appearance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
