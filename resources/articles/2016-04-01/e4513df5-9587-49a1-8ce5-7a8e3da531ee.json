News Corp Australia publications on Thursday reported that Windsor had instructed his lawyers to demand an apology from Joyce for implying that he sold part of his property to a Chinese coalmining company. Joyce denies having made the comments. \u201cThis is in the hands of the solicitors,\u201d the Nationals leader told ABC Radio. \u201cI\u2019m not going to start going through the process of litigation on air. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate. I don\u2019t believe in a sort of litigious type of arrangement, but that\u2019s where we\u2019ve ended up.\u201d He brushed aside the chances of litigation. \u201cJust because someone threatens you to say: you have to apologise for this, you have to apologise for that \u2013 doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s what happens, does it?\u201d Joyce said. The MP resoundingly won the seat of New England, in northern New South Wales, after Windsor retired at the 2013 federal election. Windsor, a longtime MP for New England, had faced some discontent among voters for helping Julia Gillard and Labor to form government in the 2010 hung parliament. But Windsor remains a popular figure and last month he announced he would recontest the seat. Some polling suggests Joyce could lose it. Joyce has often raised the fact that Windsor made a huge windfall from selling part of his farming property to his next-door neighbour, Werris Creek Coal. Windsor denies he sold the land to foreign nationals. \u201cTo be clear, I have not sold land to Chinese interests and, contrary to the misinformation Mr Joyce is spreading, I have never owned or sold a coalmine to anyone,\u201d he told the Daily Telegraph. Joyce said: \u201cMr Windsor should answer for himself. I\u2019m not here to answer for him, or make excuses for him. He can go on air and do that.\u201d The MP became leader of the Nationals in February, after Warren Truss announced his retirement. The leader of the Nationals also holds the position of deputy prime minister in a Coalition government. Joyce took on the mantle of acting prime minister late on Wednesday night, when Malcolm Turnbull left Australia for his first official visit to China."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
