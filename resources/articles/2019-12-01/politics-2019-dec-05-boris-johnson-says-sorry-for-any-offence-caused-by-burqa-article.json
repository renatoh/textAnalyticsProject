The Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union (RMT) said its members on South Western Railway (SWR) were \u201cstanding firm\u201d on the second of 27 planned strikes over the role of guards on trains. On new trains due to start running next year, SWR wants drivers to operate the doors at every stop to save time. The move to Derbyshire on Thursday by Johnson\u2019s campaign highlighted the Tories\u2019 hope to break through the so-called \u201cred wall\u201d of traditional Labour seats. Appearing at the John Smedley factory, Johnson was asked if he would \u201cabsolutely promise\u201d to get a trade deal with the EU by the end of the transition period in December 2020. \u201cI\u2019ve absolutely no doubt at all that we\u2019ll be able to make sure that the EU protects its own interests and has a deal with us that ensures that continues for the future. \u201cIf you say \u2018can I absolutely guarantee that we\u2019ll get a deal\u2019, I think I can and I\u2019ll tell you why \u2013 look at what we achieved \u2026 in three months with the new deal that I did,\u201d said the prime minister. Asked if it was a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d, Johnson said: \u201cThe possibility you allude to [of not getting a deal within a year] simply will not happen.\u201d Questioned about suggestions in the Times and the Telegraph that the government would cut taxes in a February budget \u2013 contradicting the party\u2019s manifesto, which shows taxes will go up \u2013 Johnson said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about \u2026 We\u2019re cutting taxes on business rates, we\u2019re cutting national insurance contributions for everybody in the country, everybody paying NICs.\u201d The Tory manifesto document shows that the party plans to reduce the government\u2019s tax receipts by \u00a33.195bn in 2020-21 while government revenue through taxation would increase by \u00a33.32bn. Although personal taxes would go down, the overall tax burden would increase because of changes in corporation tax. A Conservative party statement later tried to clarify Johnson\u2019s position. \u201cOur manifesto does not propose increasing taxes on UK resident companies and would not put up personal taxes for hard-working Brits,\u201d it said. \u201cWe have been very clear that we are pausing future corporation tax cuts, and will invest this money into our NHS.\u201d Earlier Johnson apologised \u201cfor any offence caused\u201d by his article describing Muslim women who wear a face-covering veil as looking like \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d. The prime minister was confronted over the issue on ITV\u2019s This Morning by Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, who said Muslims had been hurt and offended by his remarks. Johnson replied: \u201cPeople dig out all sorts of articles \u2026 I\u2019ve already said sorry for any offence caused and I say it again.\u201d The prime minister claimed his words had been taken out of context, and added: \u201cWhat [the Conservatives] have to do is have an inquiry over xenophobia and prejudice of all kinds.\u201d The original article written in the Telegraph last year argued the burqa should not be banned even though it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letterboxes\u201d. At the time, he repeatedly refused to apologise despite calls for him to do so from Theresa May, the then prime minister, and Brandon Lewis, the then chairman of the Conservative party. A panel convened by the Conservative party later ruled that he should not be disciplined because he was \u201crespectful\u201d in the piece and had been using \u201csatire\u201d. In Matlock, Johnson declined to guarantee that he would subject himself to a grilling by Andrew Neil, who has questioned Jo Swinson, Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage. \u201cI\u2019m the first prime minister to have done two, or about to do two one-on-one leadership debates, several hours\u2019 worth of phone-ins, endless press conferences and interviews with all sorts of BBC people called Andrew. \u201cAnd I will continue to submit to the interrogation of the media,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
