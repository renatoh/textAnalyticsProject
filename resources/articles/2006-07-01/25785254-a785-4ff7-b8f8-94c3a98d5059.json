An entrepreneur and physicist, Taylor is also an adviser to the European Commission on advanced surface engineering, materials and display technologies. He has founded a string of companies and taken several business qualifications. While this might not leave much time for watching television, he is determined to give the rest of us a new flat-screen technology. Taylor's involvement with developing large television screens goes back more than a decade to a 1995 meeting with Professor Rod Latham of Aston University. They were discussing a new display technology involving field emission rather than the electron guns found in conventional cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions. \"We knew if this worked, the result would be a low-cost, large-area TV,\" says Taylor. Cheap and profitable Field emission involves firing electrons in a vacuum from an array of millions of microscopic pits very close to a phosphor-coated glass screen. These pits are the equivalent of the electron guns in the neck of a conventional CRT. By taking out guns, neck and magnetic coils, you can build a large and very thin flat screen. What will this mean for the consumer? A 50-inch plasma TV costs about \u00a33,500, compared to \u00a31,700 for a 37-inch LCD or \u00a3500 for a 32-inch CRT. Taylor believes that very large but very slim screens based on field emission technology are likely to be as cheap as CRTs. It has not been an easy ride for Taylor and his colleagues. The first spin-out company failed in 2004 through lack of funding. The founders set up a new company, MIMIV Ltd, and looked for a corporate backer. By this time they had developed a second generation of the technology, printable field emission display (PFED) which needed less precision engineering and was cheaper to manufacture. A suitable partner was then found. A 20-inch prototype display is expected by the end of next year and, beyond that, 32-inch or even 42-inch sizes beckon, with production pencilled in for 2009 or 2010. Taylor's Asian backers are looking for a big slice of the flat-panel TV market. PFED has a potential competitor that doesn't need a glass-enclosed vacuum. The polymer light-emitting diode (PLED) display goes back to 1989 when Professor Donal Bradley of Imperial College was working at Cambridge University with Richard Friend and Jeremy Burroughes. During experiments in an optics laboratory, they found that a polymer - polyparaphenylene vinylene - would emit light when a current was applied. Polymers offer a cheaper-to-manufacture alternative to the organic light emitting diode (OLED) display invented by Eastman Kodak in the 1980s. Fast forward 17 years and polymer light-emitting diodes are found in upmarket electric razors, mobile phone secondary displays and MP3 players. Cambridge Display Technology was founded to exploit the patents and has granted licences to companies such as Seiko-Epson, Osram and MicroEmissive Displays. \"PLEDs are ideal for portable devices since they are light, durable and battery-friendly, yet retain a very desirable picture quality,\" says Bradley. Match-box size Most of the commercial displays are matchbox-sized, although Bradley does not rule out something bigger. \"One of the attractions of this technology is that it's very scalable.\" In 2004, Seiko-Epson created a 40-inch prototype PLED TV and last year Samsung followed with a 40-inch OLED demonstration. Another intriguing development at Imperial College looks set to revolutionise medical diagnostics. This stems from the realisation that a PLED display is a useful source of light within a scientific instrument. Together with chemists Professor Andrew de Mello and Dr John de Mello, Bradley has set up Molecular Vision Ltd. The trio hopes to combine polymer light-emitting diodes as a precision light source with photodetectors and microfluidics to perform portable lab-on-a-chip sample analysis using urine or saliva for diabetes management, sexually transmitted diseases and drug abuse. This side-trip into medical diagnostics doesn't change the likelihood that Taylor's PFED or Bradley's PLED technology will one day reach your living room. But the new-generation TVs will have to compete with CRT, LCD, plasma and four different types of projection as well as other emerging field emission technologies. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
