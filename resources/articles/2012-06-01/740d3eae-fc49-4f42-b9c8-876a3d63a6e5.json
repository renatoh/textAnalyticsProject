We start with Germany, who move closer the knock-out stages with their comfortable 2-1 win over Holland, who are on the brink of elimination after two games. Leander Schaerlaeckens joins us from Kharkiv to discuss their problems. Portugal allowed Denmark to come from two goals down after Cristiano Ronaldo squandered a myriad of chances, before Silvestre Varela scored the winner for Portugal. CNN's Pedro Pinto joins us from Warsaw to discuss the result which keeps Portugal's tournament alive. Finally, we anticipate tomorrow's clashes in Group C, where Spain play Republic of Ireland, who can't afford another slip-up, while Italy face Croatia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
