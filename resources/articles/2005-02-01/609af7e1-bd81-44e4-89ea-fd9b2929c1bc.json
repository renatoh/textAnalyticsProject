HOT DATE Tony may not be admitting it, but the Electoral Commission's timetable seems pretty convinced that Britain will go to the polls on May 5. If you haven't yet registered to vote, that means you have until March 11 to do so. Don't say the Backbencher didn't warn you. FACE IT Last week's appeal for political pin-ups bore some remarkably alluring fruit - though all of it, worryingly, was foreign. \"Do you take Swedes?\" writes Anne Cahling. Oh, any time. \"Swedish minister for justice Thomas Bodstrom is a permanent fixture on \"[word omitted] men in Sweden\" lists ... Swedish Elle called him \"a cutie in the corridors of power\". He's a former professional footballer and former lawyer so he has the lot - brains, brawn, tousled blonde hair ... Married with four children but can still be admired from afar, yes?\" The Backbencher certainly thinks so. On the plus side, the 43-year-old Thomas is keen on policing, but shows little inclination for locking up terrorist suspects without trial. He also shows signs of being very unBritishly soft on the causes of crime. Next week: the MEPs that put Kilroy in the shade. TORIES ON GIBRALTAR Part one of an occasional series. This week, ex-Royal Green Jacket Tobias Ellwood explains why he loves the Rock. \"Gibraltar has been used as a [word omitted] in negotiations between this Government and Spain,\" Tobias tells Bournemouth East voters. \"Gibaltarians\" [sic] endure unnecessary delays at the \"boarder crossing\". The \"Shengen Agreement\" isn't working. Ah, Gib - it brings out the worst in every PPC. WEST BANK BLUES The New Statesman's Ben White is worried. \"I have seen it several times in Cambridge, and my friends report seeing it in London: the black and white chequered headdress, or keffiyah,\" he writes. \"The instantly recognisable symbol of Palestinian resistance is being adopted by the fashionistas. As a supporter of the Palestinians ever since I went up to Cambridge in 2002 ... I wonder how I should respond.\" Tough one, Ben, but perhaps not a personal struggle that will resonate on the West Bank. FROM CITY HALL The Backbencher asked the Guardian's senior reporter, Hugh Muir, whether he thought Ken Livingstone would back down over the comments he made likening Evening Standard reporter Oliver Finegold to a concentration camp guard. \"I think it's still a fine judgment; I think the mayor is trying to decide just how much publicity this is going to continue to get and whether or not it will have an impact on the Olympic bid. \"Alastair Campbell once said that most stories only last for a week. We've been on this one now for almost a week and the headlines haven't gone away, which I know has been quite a surprise to Mr Livingstone and his team. I suspect that if the headlines start to recede in the next 24 - 36 hours, then he won't apologise. He is such a political loner that I'm not sure that even Tony Blair can bully him into making an apology. But if we're still talking about this and there still seems to be serious concern, then he probably will have to find a form of words. But he'll find it very difficult because the Standard and Associated Newspapers are a real bete noire of his, and he won't want to be seen to back down. \"Mr Livingstone has been through a lot worse before. As the leader of the Greater London Council he endured probably more personal criticism than any other politician - the Sun called him the most odious man in Britain. \"Of course, there's always the issue of the franchise for the free afternoon newspaper to be distributed on the tube. It could damage the Standard quite a lot, and Associated Newspapers are one of the groups that are thought likely to bid for it, if only to protect the Standard. Now Transport for London has that franchise in its gift and the mayor is its chairman, so he could well at some point exact some kind of revenge on Associated Newspapers. \"But it's worth remembering that he's a very complex animal. He could make Associated Newspapers pay a hell of a lot of money for that contract. He would also, of course, be mindful that if he was seen to make a decision that was politically motivated rather than being in the best interest of Londoners, Associated could take him to court.\" LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION Thanks for all your entries. This week's winner is Rex Gordon of Baltimore, who correctly identified the paradoxical nationals as Luxembourgers. \"I had one at lunch at Mickey D's the other day, with just a dash of paradox,\" he says. \"('Do you want paradox with that?') She was the most charming mitteleuroperin I've ever stuffed with fries.\" Readers who want to learn more about the country that prides itself on an \"obsessive search for consensus\" can do so here. \"Although prolific, Luxembourg literature remains unknown at European level,\" homo luxembourgeois explains. \"But for several decades it has had the merit of existing and developing. It is only a matter of time before it is discovered by other Europeans.\" THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION This week's prize is a copy of Peter Hyman's 1 Out of 10, an account of his transformation from Downing Street adviser to Islington classroom assistant.
