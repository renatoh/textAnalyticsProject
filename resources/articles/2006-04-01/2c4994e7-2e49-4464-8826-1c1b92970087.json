The paint on her giant canvases (12 in this exhibition) roils with tension as the viewer is gradually absorbed. These are not immediate works; they take some unravelling as familiar objects swim into view. In Baise-en-ville a woman, naked from the waist up, looks languidly into a hand mirror. Her lovers are wraiths behind her and some scant coals burn in the grate. She is oblivious of the carnage in the street below, where lie a twisted red double-decker bus and crumpled car - echoes of the Tavistock Square July bomb. In Maid's Day Off a more benign chaos surrounds a pensive figure, indifferent to the welter of clothes and bedding; the title explains all. Brown's figures exude an unembarrassed nonchalance: a couple having sex in an apocalyptic sandy landscape in Autumn Rhythm; a corpulent pair doing it standing up in a book-strewn study in New Louboutin Pumps Brown's strongest works are her most ambiguous - was that Manhattan and the 59th Street Bridge in Adoration of the Lamb? I wondered. It doesn't really matter because it's such a great picture. This is a terrific show."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
